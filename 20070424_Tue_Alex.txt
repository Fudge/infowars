[00:00.000 --> 00:30.000]  That's the law required.
[00:30.000 --> 01:00.000]  Stay tuned for the Alex Jones show on Infowars.
[01:00.000 --> 01:19.600]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen. Welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this
[01:19.600 --> 01:30.780]  live Friday edition. The 13th day of April 2007 and we're going to be live here for the
[01:30.780 --> 01:41.480]  next three hours. We have another 9-11 individual, another person going public on 9-11 and questioning
[01:41.480 --> 01:49.000]  the official story. A well known actor from television and film who currently has a highly
[01:49.080 --> 01:56.360]  rated television program coming on to talk about 9-11 and why he believes it is an inside job.
[01:56.360 --> 02:02.480]  That is coming up in the next hour. We'll tell you a little bit more about that individual just a
[02:02.480 --> 02:13.520]  little bit later. I mentioned this story yesterday but I want to at the start today to spend more
[02:13.520 --> 02:25.360]  time on it. That's a report out of News Target. Monsanto's GM corn, M-O-N-8-6-3 shows kidney,
[02:25.360 --> 02:31.840]  liver toxicity in animal studies. At the end of the show I mention this so for those of you
[02:31.840 --> 02:37.520]  listening to a rebroadcast of yesterday's program that bumps right up against my live one, you just
[02:37.520 --> 02:42.000]  heard me talking about it, but for new listeners tuning in on the AM and FM dial or Global Shortwave
[02:42.080 --> 02:50.200]  or other places, we're going to spend some time on this. The corn in question, M-O-N-8-6-3 is made
[02:50.200 --> 02:57.840]  by the Monsanto company. It isn't grown, it's made. I guess it is grown but that's all designed and
[02:57.840 --> 03:04.920]  approved for use in Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico and the Philippines
[03:04.920 --> 03:11.760]  and the United States. This is the stuff that's approved. It has had a gene inserted from the
[03:12.400 --> 03:22.480]  bacteria bacillus thronigenesis, BT, which causes the plant cells to produce a pesticide. Researchers
[03:22.480 --> 03:33.360]  fed rats either unmodified corn or diets containing 11 or 30% of M-O-N-8-6-3 for 90 days and we'll
[03:33.360 --> 03:42.720]  tell you when we get back from break what it did exactly to their bodies, what it did to their
[03:42.720 --> 03:52.520]  livers, what it did to their entire metabolic system. In the meantime I'll also just give you
[03:52.520 --> 03:59.560]  a rundown of some of the news here. I don't even know where to start. CBS has fired him from his
[03:59.600 --> 04:07.760]  radio show. He has lost his TV show of course first and most people are running around celebrating
[04:07.760 --> 04:13.880]  including Bill O'Reilly and others because they love censorship. They love to set the precedent
[04:13.880 --> 04:21.000]  of everyone being fired but themselves. Every show O'Reilly seems to do is fire this person,
[04:21.000 --> 04:28.560]  fire that person, arrest this person. I've never liked Don Imus, very abrasive, a big bully,
[04:28.600 --> 04:37.040]  somebody on a power trip relishing their petty power and so it illustrates how transitory power
[04:37.040 --> 04:43.640]  is and well how transitory life itself is. All of this stuff is just going to be blown away. It
[04:43.640 --> 04:49.440]  doesn't matter. All of us die. None of it lasts forever. None of it even lasts really for the
[04:49.440 --> 04:56.900]  twinkling of an eye but it's not just because I'm in the media that I do have a concern and get a
[04:56.900 --> 05:04.020]  chill up my spine to see this because I mean other people are being fired just for repeating
[05:04.020 --> 05:13.500]  what he said like it's some type of blasphemy. So we'll talk a little bit about Don Imus as well
[05:13.500 --> 05:19.100]  and political correctness run amok and we'll take your calls in this first hour, second hour, and
[05:19.100 --> 05:24.980]  third hour. It will be up in lines today 1-800-259-9231. Stay with us.
[05:24.980 --> 05:42.180]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands my new film Terror Storm is
[05:42.180 --> 05:46.300]  complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are
[05:46.300 --> 05:51.540]  orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them. Terror
[05:51.540 --> 05:57.300]  Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out
[05:57.300 --> 06:02.340]  by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White
[06:02.340 --> 06:09.100]  House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information,
[06:09.100 --> 06:13.540]  and much much more. Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored
[06:13.540 --> 06:18.380]  terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone
[06:18.380 --> 06:24.740]  who wants to be truly informed must see. Get your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

[06:34.980 --> 06:40.140]  can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triomethylenes, atrazine,
[06:40.140 --> 06:45.380]  benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits. Black Berkey elements are so
[06:45.380 --> 06:50.460]  powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and
[06:50.460 --> 06:55.260]  transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal-clear drinking water.
[06:55.260 --> 07:00.980]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no
[07:00.980 --> 07:05.780]  problem. Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the
[07:05.780 --> 07:10.100]  healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs. Black Berkey elements flow one and a half
[07:10.100 --> 07:15.020]  to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your
[07:15.020 --> 07:19.740]  water. Supercharge your gravity filter today. Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[07:38.100 --> 07:43.380]  and I have an urgent message for our listeners. The mass media keeps telling us that we are the
[07:43.380 --> 07:49.620]  richest, most powerful economy in the world. If this is true, why can't we pay our bills? Why
[07:49.620 --> 07:56.020]  is the United States the world's largest debtor nation? The truth is that we are in the worst
[07:56.020 --> 08:01.060]  debt bubble in our nation's history. When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your
[08:01.060 --> 08:07.700]  family? When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready? Call Whitehurst International at
[08:07.700 --> 08:19.740]  1-888-892-6238. That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports. US debt bubble red
[08:19.740 --> 08:31.180]  alert and real estate crash. Call 888-8 Xanadu. That's 1-888-8-XANADU. Ask for George.
[08:35.020 --> 08:44.460]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:49.740 --> 09:17.500]  Again, my friends, it is Friday the 13th. I just noticed that. It is April 13th. It is Friday.
[09:19.820 --> 09:25.500]  Why is Friday the 13th the Friday the 13th? I ought to go pull the exact year in history on
[09:25.500 --> 09:38.700]  this, but in the 1500s, there was a big raid or push or counter coup d'etat by the Catholic Church
[09:38.700 --> 09:48.060]  against the Knights Templars, who you could call the ancestors of the modern day Illuminati.
[09:49.980 --> 09:55.900]  They hunted them down and went to all their palaces and towers across Europe and the Middle
[09:55.900 --> 10:05.580]  East and killed them on Friday the 13th. That was the set day across the known world for the
[10:05.580 --> 10:14.540]  military forces of those different countries under the Pope's control to go in and kill them.
[10:14.540 --> 10:26.780]  I am not saying that the Catholic Church was the good guys. That's how they knew where all
[10:26.780 --> 10:30.300]  the Templars were based. That's how they knew how much wealth they had because many people in the
[10:30.300 --> 10:36.620]  Church were Templars and so it was just basically a bunch of backstabbing going on. But the Templars
[10:36.620 --> 10:42.780]  then ran to Scotland. That's why you have the Scottish Rite Freemasonry and set up their whole
[10:42.780 --> 10:54.860]  base of operations there. In fact guys, we pull up the history of Friday the 13th for me. Here's
[10:54.860 --> 10:57.980]  a few things I've just got in front of me that I've found to be interesting and I want to get
[10:57.980 --> 11:04.220]  out of the way before I get into this Monsanto corn causing serious liver and other organ
[11:04.220 --> 11:12.300]  problems in mammals. Kerry Gingrich debates global warming. This happened a few days ago
[11:12.940 --> 11:21.260]  and when you read into this it has Newt Gingrich saying global warming is real and Republicans need
[11:21.260 --> 11:27.980]  to do something about it and embrace it and get green and we need a carbon tax. So Newt Gingrich,
[11:27.980 --> 11:35.580]  we need the turbine tax, we need the wellhead tax, we need the carbon tax, we need the world
[11:35.580 --> 11:40.620]  government. This is the guy that says we should abolish the first amendment, literally get rid
[11:40.620 --> 11:46.380]  of it. This is the guy who says torture is good. I mean Newt Gingrich was put into power,
[11:47.020 --> 11:51.900]  now maybe conservatives will listen to me because I studied it, he was put into power in 94 to
[11:51.900 --> 11:57.580]  derail those Republican freshmen that did want to abolish different federal departments and did want
[11:57.580 --> 12:03.020]  to reduce the size of government. He came in and said, hey boys, we're only supposed to say that,
[12:03.900 --> 12:09.340]  okay, to the constituents. The corporate bosses want big government, that's what they feed off of.
[12:11.260 --> 12:15.500]  So they are definitely circling the wagons. I mean when the NFL and Sports Illustrated
[12:15.500 --> 12:22.220]  come out for global warming and say we need global taxes and when the Weather Channel does,
[12:22.220 --> 12:28.060]  I mean it's everywhere. When they're all over the place pushing a global tax,
[12:28.780 --> 12:31.260]  you know they mean business and they're not playing around.
[12:34.860 --> 12:38.940]  I'm not saying there isn't climate change, we've gone over this over and over again.
[12:38.940 --> 12:44.380]  There are real environmental crises that have got me very concerned because I've looked at the
[12:44.380 --> 12:51.340]  actual data. I didn't just go, you know, 15 years ago, well that's what liberals believe in global
[12:51.340 --> 12:58.780]  warming when nobody was talking about it. So it just must be a lie. I don't set about politically
[12:58.780 --> 13:05.420]  or sociologically with factoids to just prove what I already believe. I have an open mind
[13:06.060 --> 13:12.860]  and I've interviewed the experts on both sides and it is conclusive, iron
[13:13.420 --> 13:24.140]  clad that man-made global warming is a complete and total fraud. A. B. Every major study shows
[13:24.140 --> 13:34.220]  there are more benefits to global warming than there are problems. Higher carbon dioxide has
[13:34.220 --> 13:40.700]  nothing to do with heating. Carbon dioxide comes several hundred years, between 200-800 it depends,
[13:41.260 --> 13:47.900]  but it's always after the heating. Because it causes more life, ladies and gentlemen,
[13:47.900 --> 13:54.700]  with the heat, thus more carbon dioxide is off-put, both from rotting life,
[13:55.900 --> 14:02.460]  dying life, and of course the process of respiration.
[14:02.460 --> 14:11.740]  More carbon dioxide, more of the life-giving gas for plants that then put off more oxygen,
[14:11.740 --> 14:18.700]  here let me suck in some of that pollutant. Still oxygen there, there's a lot of GMO pollen,
[14:18.700 --> 14:27.260]  but we're surviving. Oh yes, they're listing carbon dioxide as an evil pollutant.
[14:27.980 --> 14:30.540]  God forbid the plants put off more oxygen for us.
[14:33.180 --> 14:39.340]  So, I already said I'd get into the news and I'm digressing. I have that article here in front of
[14:39.340 --> 14:48.140]  me. Let me, and I'm not going to get into the Wolfowitz scandal, the guy's a puppet, runs nothing
[14:48.140 --> 14:52.300]  at the World Bank. I'm not going to get into Gonzalez caught lying over and over again.
[14:52.300 --> 14:57.980]  He should be in prison for writing memos ordering the military that this was their authorization
[14:58.620 --> 15:04.780]  to torture children. But he's still a puppet, and so that's a distraction in and of itself.
[15:04.780 --> 15:07.900]  When we start hearing about indictments of David Rockefeller and
[15:09.740 --> 15:18.380]  Prince Bernhard of Orange and Queen Beatrix, when we start hearing about Prince Philip about to be
[15:18.380 --> 15:22.540]  clapped in irons or Lord Rothschild, then folks, I'm going to be covering it.
[15:25.100 --> 15:29.420]  But they laugh at how we go after their birdcage liners,
[15:31.340 --> 15:37.420]  they just remove and put in new ones. You just wait when the Bush leaves office, if he does,
[15:39.260 --> 15:44.380]  Hillary's going to rule the absolute iron fist of hell, and you will suddenly see most of these
[15:44.380 --> 15:48.300]  Democrats that could see the Patriot Act as bad, that could see the Military Commission's Act as
[15:48.300 --> 15:53.180]  bad. They're suddenly going to be running around with little glinting eyes going, it's our time
[15:53.180 --> 16:03.260]  now. No, no, no. The war is good now, and she's arresting evil militias and gun control is good.
[16:05.900 --> 16:11.100]  We've got to bolster now and wake up the liberals that are tuning into these type of shows
[16:11.100 --> 16:15.180]  because we're going after Bush and go, no, no, no, no. You got to shift your paradigm. You got
[16:15.180 --> 16:19.420]  to understand they own both parties. They move forward with an agenda. They have different
[16:19.420 --> 16:27.740]  rhetoric, but the agenda is a carbon copy. Okay, let me get into the Tasmanian devils.
[16:29.740 --> 16:33.900]  I was clued into this last night while I was cooking dinner with my wife and listening to NPR.
[16:34.780 --> 16:38.700]  You know, we monitor the National Petroleum
[16:40.940 --> 16:47.100]  Radio, brought to you by Rothschild Industries, brought to you by Rockefeller,
[16:47.100 --> 16:54.300]  a Stadenburg CPB Foundation, Tasmanian devil. So I didn't pull this up this morning.
[16:54.300 --> 17:01.100]  Tasmanian devil relocated. Tasmanian devils are being relocated to an island off Australia
[17:01.100 --> 17:10.300]  to avert their extinction by a contagious cancer, contagious cancer. Let me say it again,
[17:10.940 --> 17:19.420]  contagious cancer. The diagnoses, depending on which type of cancer, which family of cancers,
[17:19.420 --> 17:23.340]  is up on average over 2000% since the 1930s.
[17:23.340 --> 17:33.820]  Then you learn that since the 20s, there have been massive zoological studies with guinea pigs
[17:33.820 --> 17:42.220]  and rats and monkeys and dogs, hundreds of different types of animals, different varieties
[17:42.220 --> 17:48.540]  in the US, in Germany, in England, in Japan, in China, in Australia. And you learn that they've
[17:48.540 --> 17:52.540]  open air, been released, and then you learn that the Rockefellers cornered cancer treatment
[17:52.540 --> 17:58.540]  on the market and also pioneered vaccine research and pioneered cancer virus research,
[17:58.540 --> 18:03.900]  and then suddenly with their big Rockefeller cancer hospitals, the stuff starts becoming
[18:03.900 --> 18:15.340]  like a case of the flu. And boy, do they have some special injections for you. And then we have all
[18:15.340 --> 18:19.660]  the articles, I've got it for the new film I'm making, and doing all this research, because you
[18:19.660 --> 18:23.260]  get the knowledge, you come across it over the years, but it becomes like knowledge. A lot of
[18:23.260 --> 18:27.020]  you don't remember where you got it, you just have it. And then you're able to say it and then
[18:27.020 --> 18:31.420]  you go pull it up and you're exactly right. I'm always amazed by, you know, I say something and I
[18:31.420 --> 18:35.820]  go, is that right? Because I'm like, man, how do I know that from 10 years ago? And I go, pull it
[18:35.820 --> 18:41.660]  up and it's exactly right. But the point is, is that don't look it up for yourself. All this
[18:41.660 --> 18:46.940]  research into cancer viruses, and then magically it pops up and then you find out the Rockefellers
[18:46.940 --> 18:51.820]  are behind the German and British and other schools of eugenics and they're obsessed with it.
[18:52.380 --> 18:59.420]  And they're obsessed with it today. Now, there were naturally occurring communicable forms
[18:59.420 --> 19:09.660]  of cancer. And frankly, most cancer is communicable. Then you get the viruses in your
[19:09.660 --> 19:17.260]  body. And then once your body has divided its cells enough times, and once your immune system
[19:17.260 --> 19:23.100]  gets out of whack, either jacked up too high or too low, then your body isn't able to fight it
[19:23.100 --> 19:27.740]  and doesn't recognize it and you die of cancer. So I want you to know those of you that have lost
[19:27.740 --> 19:34.060]  children or husbands or wives or sons or daughters when they're older, or people who've lost cousins
[19:34.060 --> 19:39.820]  and friends and all these young people you know who've got cancer, you can thank the New World
[19:39.820 --> 19:46.220]  Order. You have been under a eugenics attack. And of course, you'll notice rates of cancer are
[19:46.220 --> 19:52.220]  higher in Asians and higher in blacks. And of course, and they can't understand it because the
[19:52.220 --> 19:56.380]  genetics aren't very different from one country to another, but you'll have one group of Orientals
[19:56.380 --> 19:59.820]  very similar to the next country, but they'll have a much higher rate, even though their diet's the
[19:59.820 --> 20:05.500]  same, which then you'll notice there's higher incidences of IMF funded World Health Organization
[20:05.500 --> 20:17.580]  vaccine programs. Of course, they don't care because now they can just engineer it right
[20:17.580 --> 20:24.780]  into the food. So I thought I'd mention these Tasmanian devils. They're pretty much all got
[20:24.780 --> 20:29.420]  the virus. Most of them are dying. They're very close to being extinct now. We'll tell you what
[20:29.500 --> 20:37.020]  the virus does to them when we get back. Nuclear reactors provide economical energy,
[20:37.020 --> 20:42.060]  but would you be prepared during an accident? During nuclear disasters, great amounts of
[20:42.060 --> 20:47.020]  radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed
[20:47.020 --> 20:52.460]  into the body. Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the
[20:52.460 --> 20:57.740]  most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning. Potassium iodate can
[20:57.740 --> 21:03.500]  protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine. This shields the
[21:03.500 --> 21:09.420]  thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine. Potassium iodate is better
[21:09.420 --> 21:15.420]  than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly,
[21:15.420 --> 21:23.100]  the sick, and pets. Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New

[21:35.900 --> 21:42.780]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson here for the 2007 Red Book. The commodity markets like gold, silver,
[21:42.780 --> 21:47.820]  copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year. This is a glaring testimony of how
[21:47.820 --> 21:53.900]  quickly the US dollar can be devalued. Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven
[21:53.900 --> 21:58.940]  while increasing the potential profits. Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven
[21:58.940 --> 22:03.580]  method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting
[22:03.580 --> 22:10.940]  into. Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95. The Red Book is the

[22:36.060 --> 22:41.980]  cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly
[22:41.980 --> 22:48.060]  attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment? Do you realize that
[22:48.060 --> 22:55.660]  mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary? But now
[22:55.660 --> 23:02.220]  it's cancer's turn to die with Lace Med Inks patented methodology. Without cutting, bleeding,
[23:02.220 --> 23:09.020]  drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without

[24:56.940 --> 25:02.060]  With George Prep, his partner, and brother, Billy, too,
[25:03.020 --> 25:11.580]  they crossed the Yukon River and found the Bonanza Gold. Below that old white mountain,
[25:11.580 --> 25:19.180]  just a little southeast of Nome, Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below.
[25:20.140 --> 25:25.020]  He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow.
[25:25.900 --> 25:30.860]  With the northern lights a running wild in the land of the midnight sun.
[25:31.660 --> 25:36.620]  Yes, Sam the court was a mighty man in the year of 1901.
[25:36.620 --> 25:37.260]  Welcome back.
[25:39.900 --> 25:48.620]  All right, let me get into these Tasmanian devils. Now, now, now notice they're in Tasmania.
[25:49.100 --> 25:55.580]  They're already on an island. They've been there for eons. And then suddenly
[25:56.620 --> 26:03.180]  it says that 90% of the devils have died of the cancer that makes their face swell up
[26:04.220 --> 26:10.620]  and their mouth become a bloody mess. Now, my only point is I get up here and I tell you that
[26:10.620 --> 26:16.300]  most cancer is communicable from all the top scientists, virologists, and the major studies
[26:16.300 --> 26:21.980]  that are out there. This is well known by people within the system, but they don't ever tell you
[26:21.980 --> 26:27.100]  this. It's really bizarre. Just your body malfunctions and this just happens. And there
[26:27.100 --> 26:32.780]  are some forms of that cancer. But very interesting that just suddenly this is happening and they're
[26:32.780 --> 26:36.940]  having to relocate them. Tasmanian devils are being relocated to an island off Australia to
[26:36.940 --> 26:44.380]  avert their extinction by a contagious cancer, contagious cancer. Some scientists fear the move
[26:44.380 --> 26:54.300]  could endanger rare birds and other animals on the island. But other experts say it is a last resort
[26:54.300 --> 27:02.460]  and should pose no problem since the devils are scavengers, not predators. The path to extinction
[27:02.460 --> 27:08.860]  is looking pretty certain on Tasmania, said William Karish of the New York-based Wildlife
[27:08.860 --> 27:14.700]  Conservation Society, who organized a workshop in Australia to help the government and biologists
[27:14.700 --> 27:23.980]  develop a plan to save the devils. And basically, if they just test their blood, make sure they don't
[27:23.980 --> 27:28.700]  have it, put them on the other island, then all the others will die, they say, over the next few years,
[27:28.700 --> 27:32.700]  then the virus will burn itself out and they can put them back over there unless it's some other
[27:32.700 --> 27:40.460]  animal that's been introduced that's carrying the virus, like the European brown rat. It continues,
[27:43.180 --> 27:47.740]  the fox-like animals with powerful jaws and blood-curdling growls are being wiped out on
[27:47.740 --> 27:53.980]  the island state of Tasmania by contagious cancer that creates grotesque facial tumors.
[27:53.980 --> 27:59.500]  The disease was first noticed in the mid-90s in the state's northeast where 90% of the devils
[27:59.500 --> 28:03.900]  have since perished. It is spreading south and west and scientists estimate that within five
[28:03.900 --> 28:08.620]  years there will be no disease-free populations in Tasmania. The only place in the world where
[28:08.620 --> 28:16.700]  the devils exist is outside zoos. And it goes on. Well, what about people, ladies and gentlemen?
[28:16.700 --> 28:24.940]  What about us? I don't like my loved ones. I don't like living on the street where I used to live
[28:24.940 --> 28:30.140]  where two kids died of leukemia, little babies and little toddlers in one year, and then, boy,
[28:30.140 --> 28:35.980]  that's really linked to the mercury and the rest of it, not to mention the cancer viruses.
[28:35.980 --> 28:41.660]  If you take their vaccines run by a criminal group of eugenicists who have been caught doing it in
[28:41.660 --> 28:47.660]  the past over and over again, you're crazy. I mean, again, you wouldn't trust your neighbors
[28:47.660 --> 28:52.300]  or an employer if they'd done one or two things to crush you or that had been deceptive and sneaky.
[28:53.020 --> 28:58.140]  But you're going to trust a government and an elite. Well, I guess most people just don't know
[28:58.140 --> 29:04.860]  how nuts they are. I do. I've done the research and let me tell you, it's fathomless how bad they
[29:04.860 --> 29:12.700]  are. And you're going to have to say no to the system and they'll fear monger and, you know,
[29:12.700 --> 29:17.020]  well, your kids might die of another disease or they might get one of the naturally occurring
[29:17.020 --> 29:21.900]  things. Yeah, they might. They just might. Of course, the problem is that some of this stuff
[29:21.900 --> 29:26.780]  is so communicable that once another child has it at the school your child goes to, they can still
[29:26.780 --> 29:30.460]  get the different viruses and things from them. It's like HV40.
[29:33.020 --> 29:38.540]  The human cancer-causing virus that they admit has caused hundreds of millions of cancers
[29:38.540 --> 29:43.660]  worldwide in humans. Every sewage system in India, and a major study that was done a few years ago,
[29:43.660 --> 29:56.380]  had was HPV40 in their sewage. It's a tough virus. It can live in really harsh environments
[29:56.380 --> 30:05.180]  like that. And it causes all sorts of cancers. When we get back, I'll tell you about it,
[30:06.060 --> 30:10.700]  about how to be put into the pollen, into your potatoes, and into your corn.
[30:14.060 --> 30:16.220]  A lot of it is in there. It's too late for a lot of us.
[30:24.220 --> 30:30.860]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:34.380 --> 30:39.180]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered
[30:39.180 --> 30:43.420]  a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs. It's called Protogrow,
[30:43.420 --> 30:47.420]  and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to
[30:47.420 --> 30:51.820]  grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions. Now here's the best part for
[30:51.820 --> 30:55.980]  our listeners who garden for self-reliance. Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients
[30:55.980 --> 31:00.140]  maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant
[31:00.140 --> 31:04.220]  growth in minimum time. Protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[31:04.220 --> 31:08.540]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants. Protogrow's full spectrum plant
[31:08.540 --> 31:11.900]  fertility meets fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste, enough to 10 times the
[31:11.900 --> 31:15.820]  nutritional value. And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass,
[31:15.820 --> 31:20.140]  you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[31:20.140 --> 31:23.820]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Protogrow website
[31:23.820 --> 31:33.500]  at growlikecrazy.com. That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[31:33.500 --> 31:40.540]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny? Yes, this is Elizabeth
[31:40.540 --> 31:46.860]  Porter back with the Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues too.
[31:46.860 --> 31:52.300]  Blue Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,
[31:52.300 --> 31:58.700]  now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m. central.
[31:58.700 --> 32:04.700]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated but never duplicated.
[32:04.700 --> 32:11.100]  Blue and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[32:11.100 --> 32:16.940]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you. Indeed,
[32:16.940 --> 32:23.740]  trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it. Tune in at 6 p.m. central.
[32:23.740 --> 32:32.060]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetmen.org.
[32:33.740 --> 32:38.780]  It's a fact, you can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been fraudulently created by the
[32:38.780 --> 32:44.140]  banks. Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its
[32:44.140 --> 32:48.620]  own debt. So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours? There's a
[32:48.620 --> 32:53.180]  double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people
[32:53.180 --> 32:58.220]  of this country can't print more money when needed. Day of Jubilee has created a successful
[32:58.220 --> 33:02.220]  program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from
[33:02.220 --> 33:07.980]  bill collectors. This is not a debt consolidation company. Join the thousands of Americans who now
[33:07.980 --> 33:12.300]  breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[33:12.300 --> 33:16.460]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[33:16.460 --> 33:24.940]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[33:24.940 --> 33:41.740]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert. Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[33:46.460 --> 34:03.740]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board and let this train keep on riding on through.
[34:16.460 --> 34:37.740]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board and let this train keep on riding on through.
[34:37.740 --> 34:51.020]  Please don't miss this train at the station. Folks, if you miss it, I feel sorry, sorry for you.
[34:51.020 --> 35:12.460]  Yeah, we've played this song a few times this week because I was just reminded that it was one
[35:12.460 --> 35:18.780]  of hundreds of songs banned. Just remember that by Claire Channel and others in the months leading
[35:18.780 --> 35:27.100]  up and a few months after the attack on Iraq in 2003. That's the level of psychological control.
[35:28.540 --> 35:33.980]  And some will say, well, that's a commie song. They use that world peace and love thing as a
[35:33.980 --> 35:41.500]  front for their world government. And they do. Anything good, anything laudable, anything
[35:41.500 --> 35:45.020]  uplifting, the New World Order is going to try to take control of or counterfeit.
[35:45.580 --> 35:54.380]  But I assure you, you may see corruption and backstabbing and subterfuge in your daily lives.
[35:54.380 --> 35:59.660]  You may see problems with your fellow man. But I assure you, the evil you see out of the general public,
[36:01.180 --> 36:05.580]  it is nothing on average compared to what we will find in elite circles.
[36:08.620 --> 36:13.420]  The New World Order is totally and completely out of control in every way.
[36:15.260 --> 36:21.100]  I know we've got Sean in Australia, Chris in Canada, Linda, Joe, David, Linda, many others.
[36:21.100 --> 36:24.460]  I'm going to go to your calls here in a few minutes. Then we've got a very interesting
[36:24.460 --> 36:27.980]  guest joining us coming up in the next hour. But we will have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[36:28.620 --> 36:34.300]  And I've just got a host of things I want to cover. But we already talked about the communicable
[36:35.260 --> 36:39.740]  cancers. And they admit there's a lot of communicable cancers, communicable cancers in humans.
[36:39.740 --> 36:47.100]  But if you type into a search engine pharmacological crops, pharmacological crops,
[36:47.660 --> 36:53.740]  or pharma crops, you will learn that they have corn, they have other plants, but corn really
[36:53.740 --> 37:00.460]  works well, that grow chemicals in the corn. I mean, where the corn literally has different
[37:00.460 --> 37:06.380]  high tech, very expensive chemicals. I mean, that's what engineering can do now, where the
[37:06.380 --> 37:11.980]  plant will actually create little polyps of a different type of chemical or polyps of a
[37:11.980 --> 37:19.180]  particular type of AIDS virus, HIV virus, or different types of other pathogens or
[37:19.740 --> 37:25.500]  live agents or bacteria. Amazing what plants can do.
[37:28.140 --> 37:35.260]  And there are literally thousands of different varieties of genetically engineered plants,
[37:35.260 --> 37:41.020]  mainly food crops. And I remember seeing an article 10 years ago where the UN was
[37:41.020 --> 37:54.220]  funding studies of an HIV inoculation in a potato, or in corn, or hepatitis antibodies,
[37:54.220 --> 37:58.700]  or hepatitis virus that would then supposedly cause you to have the antibodies, a weakened
[37:58.700 --> 38:04.460]  hepatitis, or an altered hepatitis. And oh, we're going to bring it and plant it in Africa,
[38:04.540 --> 38:09.260]  and we're going to feed it to the people. But you know, all those Africans, they're ignorant.
[38:09.980 --> 38:15.900]  They will starve. They will refuse. They let it rot at the docks, the governments do,
[38:15.900 --> 38:22.540]  when the big free ships come in with the huge granaries filled with corn and wheat
[38:24.460 --> 38:29.100]  and all these other grains. They just won't eat it, those dumb Africans.
[38:29.100 --> 38:33.340]  Oh, the Africans, when the UN comes to give their children inoculations
[38:33.340 --> 38:38.380]  from Central Africa to the West Coast to the Sahara to Southern Africa and Zimbabwe,
[38:38.380 --> 38:44.700]  why they will run into the woods, they will run into the jungles. And then you can pull up
[38:44.700 --> 38:50.060]  articles where it says, but the UN has a mandate, so they pay the local soldiers and the local
[38:50.060 --> 38:56.380]  soldiers go and forcibly make the families come to sinners for their own good, and to the local
[38:56.380 --> 39:02.700]  sports stadiums, usually the soccer stadium, and then they lovingly inject them, those dumb
[39:02.700 --> 39:10.220]  Africans. They're just ignorant. Folks, 100 years ago, because I've read the accounts,
[39:11.500 --> 39:15.260]  I've read many National Geographics, I've read books on it, I go through different phases back
[39:15.260 --> 39:19.660]  when I had time to read. I read a lot of books about the English and the Dutch and others and
[39:19.660 --> 39:26.620]  French colonists 200 years ago, 300 years ago in Africa, 100 years ago. I mean, they would beg you
[39:26.620 --> 39:31.820]  to give them big medicine, because back then, let me tell you, the Western doctors didn't come with
[39:31.820 --> 39:37.980]  cancer virus and HIV virus-laden injections. And of course, again, the doctors themselves
[39:37.980 --> 39:41.980]  aren't part of it. They think they're giving them good medicine. I mean, the Africans, you know,
[39:41.980 --> 39:45.340]  they wanted the big medicine, because back then, the white man did have the big medicine.
[39:46.060 --> 39:51.420]  I mean, we're talking big medicine, ooga booga. And the witch doctors wanted to know
[39:52.540 --> 39:59.740]  what their big medicine was. Not anymore, folks, okay, because they're down to earth,
[39:59.740 --> 40:04.460]  and they know, you take that stuff, bad stuff starts happening. Village gets sick,
[40:05.420 --> 40:11.980]  village gets Ebola. Scientists, you know, big medicine men come, then most of village die.
[40:13.980 --> 40:19.180]  And those are the accounts now. They literally run screaming with their children in their arms,
[40:19.740 --> 40:26.700]  not the dumb Americans, not the know-it-all white bread yuppies, not the know-it-all blacks in
[40:26.700 --> 40:30.620]  America, not the know-it-all Mexicans, not the know-it-all, you know, the fat,
[40:30.620 --> 40:36.780]  dumb and happy Americans. We got it all figured out. By the way, in southern Mexico down there,
[40:36.780 --> 40:42.700]  with the Yucatan and other areas, those people won't take an inoculation. They run from it.
[40:42.700 --> 40:47.660]  They don't want the government's medicine, because they're not stupid, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:47.660 --> 40:53.500]  They can see that their baby takes a shot an hour later, is having convulsions, and word spreads,
[40:53.500 --> 40:58.860]  you don't take that stuff, okay? You don't take their medicine.
[41:02.620 --> 41:06.380]  So we can learn a little from the aboriginal people of Latin America,
[41:06.380 --> 41:10.860]  a little bit from the Africans, and a little bit from the tribes in Asia.
[41:11.980 --> 41:17.180]  Oh, they're just ignorant savages. They won't take it. They don't trust us. They did in the past,
[41:17.820 --> 41:22.860]  because they saw cause and effect. All right, I said I'd go to your call. This is important
[41:22.860 --> 41:32.300]  stuff here. With that said, let me just read one article. Now, again, this is in German medical
[41:32.300 --> 41:37.740]  journals. This is in university studies from China to Germany to England to the US. Remember,
[41:37.740 --> 41:42.620]  they don't put it all together in one article, though. On Monday, I was covering how this very
[41:42.620 --> 41:51.580]  BT corn has been conclusively linked in multiple studies to causing an intestinal change in the
[41:51.580 --> 41:56.140]  honeybee. Now, most insects won't eat this. It's a pesticide that if they do eat it, it'll kill them.
[41:57.980 --> 42:07.180]  Now, now, this is admitted. This is a pesticide in the plants, and it's not just in corn. Just
[42:07.180 --> 42:12.700]  corn is the most, corn and wheat, each year, neck and neck together of what is the biggest
[42:12.700 --> 42:16.780]  filler in foods, and the soybeans trying to rival it, coming in a close third.
[42:19.020 --> 42:22.860]  Point is, just go research it for yourself, please. I mean, you've been given the warning.
[42:22.860 --> 42:30.780]  Here it is. Monsanto GM corn, MON 863 shows kidney liver toxicity in animal studies. Now,
[42:32.380 --> 42:34.860]  again, I've interviewed all these top scientists over the years.
[42:34.860 --> 42:40.700]  Who told you the same thing? People were making millions of dollars a year. They were hot shots,
[42:40.700 --> 42:45.100]  and they would do the studies and go, wait a minute, we're feeding potatoes and corn and wheat
[42:45.100 --> 42:51.980]  that's been changed, and in almost every case, it causes massive organ failure in the rats,
[42:51.980 --> 42:58.220]  in the guinea pigs, in the other test subjects, in the monkeys, and it's causing major liver
[42:58.220 --> 43:07.420]  problems, and the rat's life expectancy is more than halved, and it's causing bizarre mutations,
[43:07.420 --> 43:12.060]  not generationally, but what they didn't think was possible in the animals during development.
[43:12.060 --> 43:18.860]  I mean, a rat's body won't grow as fast as it should, but the intestines will double in size.
[43:18.860 --> 43:24.060]  A lot of Crohn's-like type disorders. By the way, those are now major studies. Vaccines are
[43:24.060 --> 43:29.180]  massively linked, I'd say it's conclusive, but totally linked to Crohn's,
[43:30.620 --> 43:33.580]  where you have an autoimmune response and they've got to cut your guts out of you.
[43:35.500 --> 43:41.420]  So, let me continue. What you need to know, conventional view, the corn in question,
[43:41.420 --> 43:47.020]  MON 863 is made by the Monsanto company and approved for use in the Australia, Canada,
[43:47.020 --> 43:51.500]  China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, the United States. It has the
[43:51.500 --> 43:58.380]  gene inserted from the bacteria bacillus thrunigenesis, BT, which causes the plant
[43:58.380 --> 44:06.940]  cells to produce a pesticide. Now, let me just stop. A pesticide that kills bugs,
[44:08.940 --> 44:15.580]  gee, should we be eating that? Folks, they know most of the people can't tell you where Iraq is,
[44:15.580 --> 44:21.100]  how many continents there are, who their governor is, who the Speaker of the House is in their
[44:21.100 --> 44:25.580]  state, much less the federal level. They don't know who one of their city, maybe two of their
[44:25.580 --> 44:32.060]  city council members are. That's why you find out David Rockefeller and Jay Rockefeller, the
[44:32.060 --> 44:38.220]  governor, or the senator there in West Virginia, that's why you find out Prince Philip, they are
[44:38.220 --> 44:42.620]  obsessed. They have their own gardens, folks. They actually have their own food flown in.
[44:43.980 --> 44:47.180]  They literally eat, drink water that's been filtered like five times.
[44:48.060 --> 44:53.020]  Okay, I mean, they know, and it's the ultimate selfishness, they're doing this to all of us,
[44:53.020 --> 44:57.020]  the ultimate sickness. They should all be arrested immediately.
[44:58.780 --> 45:03.660]  Oh, man, I'm so angry at them, because you even try to get regular organic. It's hard.
[45:04.220 --> 45:10.540]  It's hard, folks. It's pesticide is in most of the food, not pesticide they sprayed, folks.
[45:11.260 --> 45:17.180]  It's in the food. The animals eat it, they die. The people eat it, we die.
[45:18.220 --> 45:21.980]  And I know you're not going to stop. You're going to keep using cell phones up against your head,
[45:21.980 --> 45:25.340]  and you're going to keep eating all the GMO food. So am I. We're all just going to die.
[45:25.980 --> 45:28.860]  You see, they have discipline. The elite have discipline. We don't.
[45:29.900 --> 45:33.660]  And they say, well, that's the reason you're going to die. That's the reason you're a slave.
[45:33.660 --> 45:37.180]  That's the reason we're going to do this to you. You're not going to get involved in fight,
[45:37.180 --> 45:40.860]  as they say. You're not going to get involved and stop the electronic routing machines.
[45:40.860 --> 45:45.660]  You're not going to get us out of Iraq. You're going to let us keep militarizing your police.
[45:45.660 --> 45:48.460]  You're going to let us keep building more prisons, and we're going to do it to you.
[45:51.900 --> 45:59.180]  Researchers fed rats either unmodified corn or diets containing 11 and 30 percent MoN-863 for
[45:59.180 --> 46:04.300]  90 days. The rats who ate the modified corn were found to exhibit signs of liver and kidney
[46:04.300 --> 46:08.940]  toxicity, as well as signs of hormonal changes. You read the study itself, they died much earlier.
[46:08.940 --> 46:13.580]  They lost body weight. The young ones didn't develop as fast. The mechanism that causes the
[46:13.580 --> 46:19.420]  toxicity is not yet known. Geez, it's not yet known, because these studies are so stringent,
[46:19.420 --> 46:25.900]  they won't ever make claims. Let me see. It's a pesticide that kills bugs. And, oh, gee,
[46:25.900 --> 46:32.300]  the honeybees are eating this and getting sick and dying. Wow. Honeybees just love corn pollen.
[46:32.300 --> 46:36.780]  You ever seen corn pollen, those big old stalks of yellow up there? It's like, I mean, it's a bonanza
[46:36.780 --> 46:42.380]  with the bees. I mean, it's like an all-you-can-eat buffet. Poor little critters. They go over there
[46:42.380 --> 46:46.380]  and eat this stuff, and they go off and die. Meanwhile, none of the environmentalists are talking
[46:46.380 --> 46:53.180]  about this on TV. It's all some stupid tax on carbon dioxide! Let the plants breathe!
[46:54.060 --> 47:03.820]  Ah! We're all breathing the stuff! Again, no one I knew, very few people growing up had allergies.
[47:03.820 --> 47:11.820]  Very few. I say no one. I mean, literally hardly anybody. Now everybody I know has got it. My kids
[47:11.820 --> 47:16.060]  are literally hacking and coughing. Everybody else I know is coughing four or five months out of the
[47:16.060 --> 47:22.060]  year. I got, I don't want to go into details, but I'm constantly having to stop and blow my nose
[47:22.060 --> 47:27.260]  here. You can hear me stopping. My nose is constantly stopped up. Everybody I know, people
[47:27.260 --> 47:30.860]  who've never had allergies their whole life have got it, and there's hundreds of studies showing
[47:30.860 --> 47:36.380]  it's the GMO pollen. What do you think your body does when some pesticide-laden pollen with
[47:36.380 --> 47:42.620]  bacteria genetics, insect genetics, other plant genetics, human genetics, blowing around, all
[47:42.620 --> 47:50.780]  mixing with everything else goes in to your nose and goes in to your sinus? Your body is like,
[47:50.780 --> 47:57.420]  my gosh, I better have an autoimmune response to this. I better rush in and deal with this
[47:57.420 --> 48:03.580]  and create mucus to block this and wall this, and so Alex will blow it out of his nose. That's what
[48:03.580 --> 48:10.300]  my brain says. That's what the olfactory nerve says. It says, alert, alert, alert. The alarms
[48:10.300 --> 48:16.380]  are going, and I'm right here living in a growth belt with every type of agriculture you can
[48:16.380 --> 48:22.060]  imagine all around me, and then all the normal allergies, all the normal pollens can pile on top
[48:22.060 --> 48:27.580]  of that. I'm breathing pesticides in not, of course we're breathing regular pesticides too,
[48:27.580 --> 48:33.180]  from all the exterminators everywhere and all the toxic fertilizers and all the stuff in the water.
[48:33.180 --> 48:38.220]  I mean, that's all real environmental crises, but the New World Order are masters, ladies and
[48:38.220 --> 48:43.100]  gentlemen, at misdirection. They've got you with your religion. You're going to go to the rock
[48:43.100 --> 48:46.540]  concerts and feel good. I mean, even if you don't really believe in man-made global warming,
[48:46.540 --> 48:49.100]  you know your girlfriend's going to believe in it, your boyfriend's going to believe in it,
[48:49.100 --> 48:52.860]  they're going to want to go to the big concerts coming up in the seventh month of this year
[48:52.860 --> 48:56.540]  in every major city. You're going to want to go pay 50 bucks to get in that goes for
[48:56.540 --> 49:01.260]  more brainwashing, that we need a global tax, and they'll go into the global government's coffers
[49:01.260 --> 49:07.980]  with all the big movie stars and singers like you two doing it, and you'll just be sucked along.
[49:07.980 --> 49:12.460]  And I've talked to scientists, environmentalists, they go, okay, yeah, it's not conclusive.
[49:12.460 --> 49:16.060]  Not conclusive, it is conclusive, but it's a fraud. But they're saying it's not conclusive
[49:16.060 --> 49:19.500]  that it's man-made or that it's even a problem. But they'll go, you know, it gets people thinking,
[49:19.500 --> 49:23.580]  it gets them to be conscious, it gets them environmentally active. I mean,
[49:23.580 --> 49:29.500]  so what if Pecoril isn't really real? Are you for using oil and the toxic processes of refining it?
[49:29.500 --> 49:33.100]  Hey, I'm a lot less worried about the fluoride and the cracking of the molecule change,
[49:33.100 --> 49:36.540]  which is very toxic. And I don't like them dumping it in the water and it's a big problem.
[49:36.540 --> 49:45.180]  But compared to franken dust everywhere, pesticide everywhere, I mean, no, it is not.
[49:49.740 --> 49:52.460]  I know I said I'd go to your calls, but I've been wanting to talk about this.
[49:55.980 --> 50:02.460]  I mean, the globalists are just laughing at us. So you better get informed on that,
[50:02.460 --> 50:07.500]  and you better get involved. And real environmentalists and conservationists out there,
[50:08.940 --> 50:13.100]  stop giving money to Nature Conservancy and Sierra Club. All they do is go around grabbing land.
[50:13.100 --> 50:17.900]  They are criminals. They are horrible people. They're land barons. It's a joke.
[50:17.900 --> 50:21.740]  And they make you think you're doing something about the environment. And all you slack-jawed
[50:21.740 --> 50:25.900]  hippies that get in my face and, you know, you're all holier than thou. You don't know your head
[50:25.900 --> 50:33.340]  from the hole in the ground. And I'm tired of you. I've analyzed what you do. And you spend about
[50:33.340 --> 50:39.260]  five percent of your time on GMO and serious issues. Now, deep down, you know the truth.
[50:39.260 --> 50:45.260]  You go and stuff your face and go look for organic stuff for yourself. But, you know,
[50:45.260 --> 50:50.060]  I don't see you picketing outside the schools telling them, don't eat GMO foods, don't have
[50:50.060 --> 50:55.420]  GMO BT corn, just one species that has pesticide in it. I don't see you doing anything real.
[50:56.060 --> 51:00.860]  You just run around and steal people's property and, you know, hopefully get a little patronage,
[51:00.860 --> 51:06.140]  a little peerage, jobs out of it. And you need to be slapped upside your face.
[51:08.940 --> 51:16.940]  Because I just can't believe what scum you are. I just, I just, because, again, you're really bad.
[51:16.940 --> 51:21.820]  You're not just the dumb public. You're out there thinking you're doing something and you're
[51:21.820 --> 51:26.620]  actually having your energies used to set up a world tax so these killers can really
[51:26.620 --> 51:31.180]  nail us to the wall. We'll talk to a caller in Australia, Canada, everywhere when we get back.
[51:37.180 --> 51:40.700]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands,
[51:40.700 --> 51:45.500]  my new film Terror Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that
[51:45.500 --> 51:49.580]  Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a
[51:49.580 --> 51:55.740]  pretext to enslave them. Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks
[51:55.740 --> 52:00.380]  of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies
[52:00.380 --> 52:06.220]  that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[52:06.220 --> 52:11.420]  secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more. Terror Storm is the
[52:11.420 --> 52:15.500]  definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of
[52:15.500 --> 52:21.180]  government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[54:38.860 --> 54:43.340]  the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[54:46.940 --> 54:49.980]  All right, thanks for holding. I'm going to go right to your calls. I'm even going to
[54:49.980 --> 54:55.100]  dispense with plugging the documentary films on the online video and bookstore at infowars.com.
[54:55.100 --> 55:00.140]  That is kind of a plug, isn't it? Let's go to Sean in Australia, then we'll go to many others.
[55:00.140 --> 55:05.500]  Go ahead. Hi Alex. Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my call, mate. Listen, you've been on fire in the
[55:05.500 --> 55:09.260]  last few weeks. It's been really great. I called you up a few weeks ago and you were pretty upset
[55:09.260 --> 55:13.580]  through that whole period and I know it's been terrible, the stuff that's been going on, the
[55:14.380 --> 55:18.620]  perversion and the treatment of children and all the sorts of things that have been going on and
[55:18.620 --> 55:23.660]  it's all tied in with the way that they think they can manipulate our minds with this fear and
[55:24.220 --> 55:26.860]  they'll never get to our souls though, mate. They'll never get to our souls.
[55:27.820 --> 55:31.500]  But I wanted to tell you about something that I didn't notice on prison planet dot com.
[55:32.300 --> 55:38.380]  This was a story on Raiders News and it was titled experts warn terrorists could launch
[55:38.380 --> 55:42.620]  nuclear attack on the US. Well, I did see that about a week ago. I mean,
[55:42.620 --> 55:46.460]  the experts are always saying we're going to be nuked, we're going to be hit, give up all your
[55:46.460 --> 55:53.820]  rights. Yeah. Now this guy, the two experts were Sidney Drell, CFR and Robert Gallucci.
[55:54.460 --> 55:58.060]  Okay. That's Carlisle. That's the former head of the Carlisle group.
[55:58.060 --> 56:02.460]  Yeah. He was the one that put in, uh, uh, what is his faith? I think his name was.
[56:02.460 --> 56:07.740]  Yeah, Douglas. Yeah. And now what I don't know what you know on William Cooper,
[56:08.540 --> 56:14.460]  but he goes into all of the disclosure, you know, like the secretive, uh, high technology and stuff.
[56:15.020 --> 56:20.700]  And he had said in his, uh, what his research had found was that the new order plans were
[56:20.700 --> 56:25.820]  to disrupt any disclosure would be through a nuclear tactic. Contingency plan would be that
[56:25.820 --> 56:30.620]  if the information started to become public or should any, uh, you know, information get close
[56:30.620 --> 56:35.500]  to being, you know, widely available. It called for a public announcement that a terrorist group
[56:35.500 --> 56:38.860]  had entered the United States with an atomic weapon. It would be announced that the terrorists
[56:38.860 --> 56:42.860]  plan to detonate the weapon in a major city. Martial law would be declared and all persons
[56:42.860 --> 56:45.900]  with implants were ran up, blah, blah, blah, all these sorts of things. Now,
[56:45.900 --> 56:50.940]  when you look at this article that drill and Gallucci are facing, this is the warnings to
[56:50.940 --> 56:56.860]  Congress too. They had said things like, uh, that our party could launch a massive attack
[56:57.580 --> 57:05.020]  that, you know, um, basically, and I'll tell you what's scary. The CFR board, but at that time
[57:05.020 --> 57:12.460]  chaired by Gary Hart and Warren Redmond put out a report 11 months before nine 11 saying that
[57:12.460 --> 57:18.140]  there'd be attacks on New York, big attacks then that, and then they called for a Homeland Security
[57:18.140 --> 57:23.660]  and so they, and they love to basically openly brag about what's going to happen. Yes. The cards
[57:23.660 --> 57:31.100]  are on the table. It is in the game. They are seriously considering detonating, uh, atomic
[57:31.100 --> 57:35.260]  weapons in this country. Now what's frightening is, is how that, you know, like you mentioned,
[57:35.260 --> 57:42.540]  they love dates and here they are looking at this seven, seven of seven, you know, silly thing about
[57:42.540 --> 57:48.540]  global warming. It's a frightening prospect that they could utilize that type of, uh, you know,
[57:49.580 --> 57:54.860]  placid public at those sorts of times. I mean, if we can preempt it by pointing out their stupid
[57:54.860 --> 58:00.620]  feudal plans, then let's do it. But the truth is that this is, this is how crazy they are.
[58:00.620 --> 58:04.540]  And then he goes on to say in this article, she said that one of the, uh, the, the comments that
[58:04.540 --> 58:08.700]  Gallucci made was if we discover that a country has purposely transferred fissile material or
[58:08.700 --> 58:13.180]  nuclear weapons or terrorist group, we will be telling them in advance that we will treat them
[58:13.180 --> 58:16.860]  as though they were the one who launched the attack and they should expect devastating retaliation.
[58:16.860 --> 58:21.980]  Now what they're going to do is, and they may went way well, very well may, this is what the CFR
[58:21.980 --> 58:27.660]  saying, detonate a bomb, claim that Iran gave it to Hezbollah or something like that. And then
[58:27.660 --> 58:31.660]  they've been saying that that's what the neo-cons say every day. I tell you, Iran's going to give
[58:31.660 --> 58:36.140]  the nuke to Hezbollah. They're going to nuke us. And so they get to nuke us, get the globalists,
[58:36.140 --> 58:40.060]  get to set up a police state when they did it. And then they get to go attack their enemies.
[58:40.060 --> 58:45.740]  Yeah. And then Gallucci has written this, uh, article in, uh, in a journal of the, uh,
[58:45.740 --> 58:49.180]  Annals of American Academy of Political and Social Science. It was titled
[58:49.180 --> 58:54.300]  averting nuclear catastrophe. The, the, the, I did, uh, I did see that a few weeks ago. Why
[58:54.300 --> 58:59.660]  don't you email it to Aaron at info wars.com right now, or I'll just try to Google search it
[58:59.660 --> 59:02.620]  and pull that up and we'll get that reposted. I did have that in the stack.

[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.140]  during the one minute breakup as the last hour ended I was thinking I'm on the air calmly
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:18.860]  talking about CFR reports that are saying we're going to have Al-Qaeda hit us with nukes
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:24.300]  before the 2004 election Dick Cheney told us news and world report quote we will be nuked by the
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:30.060]  election so it doesn't mean they're always going to do it I mean they love to scare monger but
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:35.020]  sometimes the threats they put out is exactly what they carry out and then blame on these
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.740]  shadowy imaginary enemies and they get to have their cake and eat it too they get to who says
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:45.180]  you can't in tyranny you do I guess for a while you can go on for a long time go on for a long
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:51.980]  time but sooner or later god's going to cut you down and they get to carry out the attacks play

[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:20.220]  and we had a decent response um I just wanted to take the opportunity to try to
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.980]  try to get more people involved and uh to go to craigslist,
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:32.060]  Pittsburgh and the groups section and you'll see my post for the 9-11 truth group forming

[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:42.300]  want but I like it when people call in and talk about a subject and then put a plug in
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:47.820]  and also it becomes habitualized continually it'll make stations turn off the show because
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.740]  about seven eight years ago my show just turned into hey I got a tractor for sale

[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:18.780]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome thank you for joining us we're now about eight minutes and 45
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:24.060]  seconds into this second hour we will have open phones throughout this hour into the next hour
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:29.100]  and I have a huge stack of important news we'll be covering I guess about three weeks ago I learned
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:36.140]  that Mr. Francie here on the Genesis network with who does a show a couple nights a week
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:42.300]  on the Genesis World Report and interviewed another celebrity who'd gone public on 9-11
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:49.100]  being an inside job Daniel Sunjata and I don't watch on television but I had once or twice
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:54.060]  actually seen the television show because it's very popular one of the most popular on cable
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:10:01.580]  on fx Rescue Me the star Rescue Me and he plays the fireman Franco on the program and he's had
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:06.060]  a lot of other roles of course in television and movies and but the point is he has the courage to
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:17.820]  go public on 9-11 you know frankly um Kurt Vonnegut didn't it was never clear if Kurt
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:22.700]  Vonnegut wanted his views on 9-11 to be public so I didn't make his full views that have been
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:29.100]  relayed to me and threw him to me on 9-11 as we put a story out yesterday about was Kurt
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:34.380]  Vonnegut a 9-11 truther the headline probably should have been Kurt Vonnegut was a 9-11 skeptic
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:40.700]  and I found out that he'd seen my films by one of his business partners his associate
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:46.300]  then I got in contact with him I'm sending more of my films per request and Kurt Vonnegut then
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:51.900]  sent me a signed you know one of his lithograph paintings of the open bird cage you know the
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:56.780]  freedom of the mind I guess or freedom of the soul is what it symbolizes he said or just you
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:02.780]  know freedom and you know hand signed and I just felt like you know the guy died two days ago it
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:06.780]  was public yesterday and that's important historically I mean he said the only difference
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.500]  between Bush this is an exact quote the only difference between Bush and Hitler is that
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:17.500]  Hitler was elected and that he was elected the president then he became president and chancellor
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:22.220]  abolished those offices for the office of the Fuhrer when von Hindenburg died he became the
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:29.500]  chancellor as well so uh yes uh bottom line Kurt Vonnegut another you know just an icon
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:35.980]  uh was investigating 9-11 and I can tell you knew that it wasn't certainly wasn't what we were told
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:39.900]  but I'm gonna leave it at that because some of the stuff that was relayed to me was private
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:46.380]  but uh we deserve to know that I'm gonna leave it at that but there are a few skeptics on the
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.620]  message board going what are you doing what are you posting this for you know so you claim he
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:57.660]  sent you this letter and he sent you this this uh you know little pictures hand signed oh I bet
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:02.780]  well folks I mean it's really true that uh James Brolin's gone public on 9-11 and
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:08.140]  Rosie O'Donnell and Charlie Sheen and and frankly if I told you the people that I know personally
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:13.580]  that know about 9-11 it even dwarfs those huge celebrities of the top five biggest people in
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:19.900]  Hollywood I personally talked to three of the biggest okay who who've known for years it's
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.500]  an inside job but they're not going to go public and I'm not going to blow their cover but I'm
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:30.460]  going to shut up about that uh Daniel um Sanjata has incredible courage and he joins us now
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:36.460]  yeah via cell phone are you in Chicago or Los Angeles I'm actually in New York City right now
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.660]  you're in New York right now well thanks for listening thanks for listening for three minutes
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:45.180]  while I battle tell us a little bit about yourself about your tv show you know uh why you
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:49.580]  like playing a fireman some of the easy stuff up front and then how you woke up to 9-11 and
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:54.860]  what you think happened and what the repercussions have been of going public sure well uh you know
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:59.580]  there really haven't been too many uh repercussions at this point Alex I think I'm a small enough fish
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:05.340]  in the pond that my coming out publicly about 9-11 being an inside job has not created any
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:12.860]  you know tremendous you know seismic uh disturbances uh but um I did want to say though I think it
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:19.020]  really is getting to a point where uh it's I don't know the quote exactly I've heard you say it many
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:23.900]  many times though that that you know it and I'm hoping that you can repeat it from for my benefit
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.820]  maybe for the benefit of your audience members who might also not remember it something about
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:32.940]  uh when a patriot first speaks out it's you know it's something that's dangerous sure sure it's
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:39.660]  Mark Twain I usually flummox it myself but uh I mean the full quote is a patriot in the beginning
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:45.820]  is a scarce man uh hated and feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds let him
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:50.780]  join him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot that's my claim amen amen to that
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:54.220]  um I think it really is getting to the point where it's uh I wouldn't say it's getting to the point
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:58.380]  where it maybe cost nothing to be a patriot but it certainly seems like it's getting to that
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:03.980]  very critical tipping point where speaking out about 9-11 truth is uh is something that's
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.780]  becoming almost popular to do and I don't know what exactly it is you know it's almost like
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.900]  I'm watching this huge dam that seems like it should have broken about three four months ago
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:19.340]  and maybe when it's maybe when loose change hits theaters this summer um maybe if we can finally
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:25.340]  get a very public platform for people like professor Stephen Jones uh yourself uh other
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:30.300]  people who have come out publicly rosy charlie to actually talk about these issues maybe then
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:35.260]  maybe then it'll the dam will completely break and uh and it'll become it will have an opportunity to
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:40.540]  really debate the actual facts of uh and points of contention in a public arena that's what I'm
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:45.980]  really hoping for in terms of my background um you know I'm just again I'm a small fish in the
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:50.300]  pond I'm just I'm a working actor in New York City the only reason why I felt like me speaking
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:56.860]  out may possibly uh be important in any way is because I happen to be representing me and the
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:01.260]  other guys on the show we're representing these heroes these men and women who who died that day
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:06.220]  and who risk their lives daily doing a job that most of us do not have the courage to do um and
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:12.300]  my moral conscience just wouldn't let me would not let me remain silent considering uh the uh the
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:17.580]  great importance of this particular issue well I wouldn't call you a small fish but I would say
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:23.740]  this I'm I mean I'm a nobody but we're all somebody at the same time and and it is courage
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:30.140]  for a school teacher that goes public or professor or a police officer or a fighter pilot or somebody
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:35.180]  with one of the you know almost highly rated tv shows on cable uh I mean you're not a small fish
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:39.900]  it does take courage and you're right that it's getting a little bit safer for people to go public
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:45.340]  I just wish that some of the really huge names out there and some of them have been that kind
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:49.820]  of demonized and set up as a late kind of a hint so maybe that's why you're not hearing one of them
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:55.420]  go public um because of the mistakes they've made or whatever but you know the point is uh
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:01.420]  hint hint it's not very hard to figure out here folks uh I mean there's just so much going on
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:06.300]  this is do or die I mean these globalists I mean they may set off a nuke they could start a new
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:11.900]  war they could release bird flu I mean you can't put anything past them uh give me your response
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:17.100]  or your angle on what I just said there oh absolutely I mean I really do think that it's
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:21.260]  crucial especially before the 2008 elections I mean I've heard your predictions and I've heard
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:25.820]  predictions from other pretty credible experts who are very good at kind of analyzing the uh
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:29.820]  the weather cat the weather patterns so to speak and being able to look you predicted
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:35.260]  you predicted 9 11 um other people are now saying that you know we're militarizing the area right
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:41.820]  around uh the borders of iran and uh uh all of the same indicators are present that were present
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:48.620]  before 9 11 for some kind of terrible terrible event and I think that unless I agree with you
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:53.660]  that unless we do unless we call enough attention to 9 11 unless we're able to to bring this out
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:57.980]  into a public forum of debate uh it's very possible that we could see another false flag
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:03.180]  event or any excuse that would give uh bush and his administration a reason a reason to
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:08.620]  declare a national state of emergency uh would then plunge us into uh you know it would just
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:13.580]  plunge us into a horrible horrible time in human history and I think it's still possible to stop
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:18.300]  it I want to believe that I'm an optimist um I would like to believe so anyway now talking to
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.780]  Christine Ebersole uh who's also television movies that's one of the number one shows on Broadway
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:28.460]  right now she went public saying it's a total inside job giving the evidence uh on her blog
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.100]  here on the Genesis Network with John Connor and other places and she got heat from her manager and
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.500]  other people that really got support from the crowd and people in the street what response
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:43.900]  have you gotten from people uh you know a in uh the uh you know whole Hollywood slash New York
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:53.100]  Chicago scene uh what response have you gotten from uh just the general public and then when
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:58.940]  you're talking to people and uh and I mean I would imagine you warned them and make the same
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.700]  points you just made here hey we got to get the word out now hey do you know about false flag
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:07.260]  terror what do your colleagues say when you talk to them well you know it's interesting there are
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:11.980]  a couple of my colleagues uh people that I actually work with on rescue me who at first were
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.100]  you know they they listened to some of the information they tried to
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.940]  you know their knee-jerk response was to start offering some excuses well couldn't it have been
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:24.300]  bad and maybe it was this and wouldn't everybody have had to have been in on it what are you telling
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:30.460]  me the whole government is in on this in this conspiracy um but after looking at the information
[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:36.460]  a little bit more carefully uh soberly kind of comparing the inconsistencies that are being
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:42.940]  highlighted by very credible experts uh to the official story and what we have been told
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:46.940]  uh now there are a number a number of them who are starting to who have come to me privately
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:52.940]  and are voicing uh their very deep concerns um about 9-11 some of these people are firefighters
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.420]  who work with us every day on the show a couple of these people are actors who work with us on
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:02.940]  the show um but uh in my in my personal life you know some of the stuff that I've been doing aside
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:07.820]  from going on uh lone lantern and resistance radio and now coming on your show has been just
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:12.860]  hitting the streets just hitting the streets with leaflets with uh with dvds copies of loose change
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:19.100]  or 9-11 mysteries or terror storm and just uh you know passing out the information couple sometimes
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:23.340]  you know here in new york city it's almost like you a lot of times you feel like you're preaching
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:29.420]  to the choir uh when you're expressing these kind of views um not necessarily about 9-11 but you
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:34.860]  know it's a it is a very blue state um but moving past the left-right paradigm I think that a lot of
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:41.100]  people are uh are very concerned about 9-11 don't really know haven't taken the time to actually
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.420]  educate themselves I haven't gotten into any verbal arguments on the street with people
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:49.340]  um I haven't been attacked by anybody as I've been passing out the information actually most
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:53.500]  of the responses that I get are uh sometimes people just don't take the information and say
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:58.860]  yeah I know already or yeah we're we're you know we're aware of it um you know it kind of
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:04.540]  varies it varies and then in my my read my personal personal life like with my friends family stay
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:10.220]  there stay there Daniel uh Daniel Sanjata is our guest we're honored to have him just an amazing

[01:24:52.540 --> 01:25:00.060]  daniel sanjata is our guest and of course he is the main star the big star on the fx hit program
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:07.260]  rescue me uh continuing uh talking to your friends uh what's the response that you're getting uh i've
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:11.820]  been getting more candid responses from people you know that i'm not approaching let's say at work or
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:15.980]  strangers that i'm approaching on the street you know from friends and family uh the response has
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:23.340]  been uh uh less self-centered shall we say uh definitely you know most of them are completely
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:27.180]  on board once i actually point out the inconsistencies with the official story or at
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:31.180]  least the ones that i've been able to memorize so far i mean there's so many so many thousands of
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:38.140]  them um you know i also wanted to say alex that uh i think it is actually perfect for people who
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:42.540]  happen to have a lot of baggage let's just say or maybe the way that they've lived their lives or
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:46.060]  might might be preventing them from actually coming out publicly about 9-11 because they're
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:51.180]  worried about ad hominem attempts at character assassination i mean uh you know one of the
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:55.020]  reasons for instance when you pointed this out maybe a week or two ago when rosie first came out
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:59.820]  it's perfect it's absolutely perfect that she came out because they're going to obviously their their
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:06.460]  their mo is instead of addressing the actual uh points that she is trying to uh that she's
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:11.740]  addressing they will attack you on on your past on your on on the fact that you happen to be maybe a
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:15.900]  celebrity and therefore why should you even open your mouth about anything of consequence
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:21.100]  um that is actually a perfect entree for us to redirect and to say well why is it every time we
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:25.660]  say something about partially evaporated steel columns in the wreckage of building seven or
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:31.580]  uh you know the the the law of falling bodies and how can buildings collapse at free fall speed why
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:35.820]  every time we bring up some piece of credible science why do you say something about the fact
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:41.980]  that uh you know so and so happens to be uh you know uh you know leading an alternative
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:46.780]  lifestyle or you know gay or lesbian or why do you attack me because of uh you know the fact
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:51.580]  that i used to you know do drugs and and run run around town with you know bunches of women as
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:56.460]  they've done in various cases with other people who've come out in the past so you know it really
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:01.260]  just makes them look complicit in an obvious cover-up it doesn't lend any credibility to their
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:07.020]  denial no you're right i mean they can't help it and it blows up completely in their face but
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:10.780]  first off i'm really honored to find out you're a listener i didn't do any pre-interview never
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:15.980]  talked to you before till you came on daniel and i i'm a huge fan i'm a huge fan of yours
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:20.860]  absolutely well that just humbles me because it always shocks me how many people tune into this
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:26.220]  show to hear me bumble around in my redneck fashion but uh thank you so much my friend
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:32.700]  but no i mean you're absolutely right that they ignore it when physicists and scientists at
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:37.500]  underwriting laboratory engineers who underwrote the buildings come out and say it's a fraud and
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:43.740]  impossible and a hoax because they have to show but still they take the bait on celebrities
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:49.180]  because they can't ignore it they blow it up they try to chill free speech and then that blows up in
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:55.340]  their face i mean i i just at certain levels this new world order is really incompetent yeah yeah
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:28:00.300]  they really are they really are i think it's that they're operating just on you know a really
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:05.180]  really old paradigm that's it that's it terms of you know terms of controlling the public mind these
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:09.740]  are tactics that used to work but they're not taking into account the telescoping of evolution
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:14.780]  and the fact that human species is now beyond the point of their old methods of control and before
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:19.100]  they'd be i think before they're able to come up with something new to control the public mind uh
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:22.940]  hopefully we're going to be able to practice thing wide open and make sure that it never happens again
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:28.140]  wow you just said that uh i mean in a great way the evolution of technology alone
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:33.980]  uh doubling every two years or even faster and it's really just gotten away from them i mean
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:38.300]  they've got a lot of geniuses and high-tech people in their technocracy that i know are giving them
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:42.700]  new ways to control us but these old elites are still making the decisions i mean literally
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:47.100]  folks and i'm not knocking old people who are great but it's like 85 year olds and and and i
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.980]  mean prince bernhard was running most of this uh out of the netherlands dot a few years ago at 93
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:56.860]  and was still calling a lot of shots at bilderberg henry kissinger every week's but at the white
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:01.660]  house it turns out for six years literally running things with george shultz i mean kissinger's almost
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:06.940]  90 george shultz i think is over 90 i mean i'm sorry folks we're gonna kick their butt
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:12.780]  that's the truth i mean alex how are they how are they marginalizing how is it that they're
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:17.820]  able to prevent the opinions of people like robert bowman ray mcgovern kevin ryan david
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:24.140]  shaler stephen jones how are they able to keep such credible expert opinions completely
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:29.020]  marginalized it's something that's hard and i work in the media and it's hard for me to fathom
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:34.220]  how they can ignore what these people are saying i can understand them ignoring me i can understand
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:39.500]  them ignoring maybe even rosie or charlie or whoever but when you have people who are obviously
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:44.380]  in the know you have retired air force pilots people who train the top guns who are coming out
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:51.580]  and saying 9 11 was an inside job and cnn bbc none of the major media news outlets are even
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:55.980]  giving this you know giving it even a moment of attention how is that possible you know what we

[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:55.740]  wow this is a really great interview i enjoyed getting the perspectives and talking to daniel
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:03.340]  sunjata who again has the hit tv show one of the stars one of the most popular stars up there on
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:10.780]  the hit tv show that's on fx rescue me where he plays the part of a firefighter and uh they're
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:14.460]  in new york i guess producing the tv show they have a chance to talk to a lot of the
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:21.660]  firefighters in new york and i have this experience when i was in new york at several
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:27.180]  different memorial services over several different anniversaries and i've been there to cover the rnc
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:33.740]  as well and for four years ago or so about half the cops really hated us and a lot of the
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:37.420]  firefighters said yeah we know something's going on but we don't know that's an inside job
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.420]  now that's totally flipped where the majority of the firefighters
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:46.300]  literally were going oh yeah we know and telling us all these facts and statistics and numbers
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:52.300]  most the cops knew my name hey alex how you doing keep it up and then they'd turn away and smile at
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:57.740]  us i mean it was it was amazing that's why i'm going to go back this sixth anniversary on 9 11
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:01.580]  we're just gonna have a spontaneous demonstrations there on the morning of 9 11 hope to see you all
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:05.740]  there and i'm sure there'll be more events as well as as that develops uh daniel what were we
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.740]  talking about before we went to break there was some point and then you got cut off by the break
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:13.340]  yeah i was just wondering alex i mean with your with your intimate knowledge of the way that the
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:19.580]  media works and the way that they try to manufacture consent bound debate etc etc how is it possible
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:24.380]  they're marginalizing the opinions of such credible experts as you know robert bowman
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:29.100]  ray mcgovern and the list goes on i mean people who actually are in the know and whose opinions
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:33.740]  should be listened to again i said before we went to the break i can understand them ignoring
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:38.620]  somebody like me or marginalizing somebody like rosie o'donnell or charlie sheen even though they
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:44.700]  shouldn't but when it comes to the people who come from the institutions that people who worked
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:49.580]  inside the system who are coming out publicly saying 9 11 was an inside job how can they ignore
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:56.380]  those opinions i just don't understand that well uh operation uh operation mockingbird number one
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:02.700]  because going back to the 50s we have the cia documents where they brag about how they already
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:07.180]  controlled almost all the major newspapers all you've got to do is have the editor of the new
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:12.780]  york times the editor of the washington post uh or the sub editors at those key papers you'll
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:17.980]  have a whole nest of them key people inside cnn key i mean at fox it's open you've got
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:22.780]  on the board of directors viet den who uh you know wrote the first patriot act and
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:28.940]  torture memos contributed to torture memos i mean at fox it's just open you got tony snow
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:33.500]  you know the revolving door is the white house press secretary former fox contributor
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:40.140]  he'd co-host the rush limbaugh program so you've got fellow travelers with the elite system on the
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:44.460]  left and the right who are all controlled by the same uh you know private corporate structures
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:51.820]  then you've got cia then you've got thousands of top reporters who've been hired for pr campaigns
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:55.900]  then congress has ruled this illegal but the president continues and clinton was doing it but
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:00.140]  it's ballooned under bush and i'm sure into the next democratic president will get even worse
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:05.900]  that's just the process of billions in fake news and you've got the extreme examples of tommy
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:12.140]  franks getting 500 plus thousand a year after he got out of the military from the defense department
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:17.260]  in the cia contract to go around talking about how martial law is coming but you know that's what
[01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:21.580]  we have to have it's too bad i mean that's chilling folks they paid him to go out and
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:25.820]  say that on all these tv shows and at the time i said that guy's a spook
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:30.700]  i mean i saw him on the cover of cigar aficionado you know wearing cia cufflinks i mean it's a big
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:35.900]  joke to these people and they and they think it's all real funny and then you've got others who
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:41.180]  were just don't even really consciously think about it hey armstrong williams uh we want you to
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:48.380]  take 240 something thousand dollars just to go say as a black conservative uh that you're for
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:53.180]  a head start uh which is really just a big government program to cps the kids sounds good
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:57.420]  you know to help the kids but still it's big government why is bush doing it well it's it's
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:03.100]  corporate welfare it's control uh but the point is you know that's the lighter end of it i mean
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:10.300]  1.8 billion just in fake news for the prescription drug program uh we uh i added up just propaganda
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:15.020]  the first four years of his administration with the contracts we can find almost 25 billion in
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:20.860]  fake news brother that's how they're doing it but when a star comes out they know that they
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:27.100]  can't contain that even in the alternative media or in some of the b-tier and c-tier tabloids
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:32.940]  so they go ahead and try to use that as kind of a cultural zeitgeist to demonize it because they
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:38.220]  know there's a subconscious envy and general hatred in the public a love-hate relationship
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:42.540]  of anyone who's celebrity uh and so they try to act you know it's kind of like the thing with
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:46.060]  imus i hate imus don't like imus he certainly should have probably had some repercussions
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:50.700]  i don't know this much but again everybody kind of likes it because oh he's rich let's get him
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:55.580]  so i mean it's hard to even describe how this whole thing you know is this big cauldron that
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:39:02.540]  kind of uh mixes together uh but uh basically the it's being steered uh by and then of course the
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:07.500]  big corporate chiefs a lot of them may have an editor under him who's cia they're not cia they're
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:12.940]  members of the cfr where they all just get on the same because they have so many uh intersecting
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:17.740]  agendas in their empires that they have to get together and basically try to steer everything
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:23.660]  i mean i mean that's kind of a nutshell give me your take you know to be honest the reason why i
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.980]  asked you alex is because i really am having a hard time understanding it it's hard for me to
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:32.860]  conceive how uh you know without the inside knowledge that you have as i said of the way
[01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:38.060]  that the inner workings of the media uh operation mockingbird and the like uh it's just hard for me
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:46.220]  to conceive of how people whose whose whose uh opinions are so informed uh people who actually
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:50.860]  served and worked in the system if you have these people with that kind of a pedigree who are at
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:54.700]  least raising questions at the very least they're raising questions and in the most extreme cases
[01:39:54.700 --> 01:40:01.020]  they're actually pointing fingers um you know if this free the american free press needs to be
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:05.500]  absolutely ashamed of themselves the fact that they can just ignore these things or if they do
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:10.700]  address them address them in such an obviously biased and twisted way uh really just this is
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:16.220]  to me this is an eye-opener because i really i was aware of the uh you know the manufacturer of
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:19.980]  consent borrowing a title from noam chompsky i know you're not a big fan of his and i'm starting
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:25.420]  to have serious questions about him myself now well no i mean i i mean i read uh two of his books
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:33.340]  i watched one of his videos i've read a lot of his papers i i mean if somebody tells me 95
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:39.260]  truth but then gives me false solutions you know the un is going to save us well i'm sure there
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:43.740]  are good people at the un who mean well at the mid level and the low level it's like the red cross
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:49.020]  i'm not against the red cross itself they're good people in it the leadership is corrupt
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:54.300]  and knowingly collected blood with aids and hepatitis in it and knowingly sold it for blood
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:41:00.300]  products you know and knowingly steals a lot of the money for themselves so noam chompsky puts
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:05.260]  out a lot of good info it's just that when it comes to 9-11 i got a clip of him he said so what
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:10.860]  even if it's true so what well what is he talking about i saw that that was a jaw dropper i couldn't
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:16.380]  believe he said that because i mean i had been i had read a number of his books i had seen uh
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:21.020]  he's done you know most famous documentary manufacturing consent and some others and once
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:25.260]  i started doing my own 9-11 research my media i was like oh i wonder what norm chompsky has
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.860]  to say about this he's probably going to have something scintillating something penetrating to
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:34.300]  say about it and to hear him say that it doesn't matter i mean i was like what does he does he
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:39.980]  really mean that is he who does this guy work for who who's book reading well he knows it he
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:46.540]  knows 9-11 truth threatens the entire structure and you see the left a lot of these guys that
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:50.060]  you know are elitist but they delude themselves they can sleep with themselves at night so they
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:55.340]  can get rest so they don't feel guilty well yeah there is always an elite but we need a
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:42:02.940]  loving guided you know kind of uh plato elite uh that uh understands and that and then they just
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:09.420]  argue over who's going to run the power levers you see well you know i think that's one of the
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:15.100]  reasons why it's really important that we have people like you doing the work you're doing uh
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:19.500]  other people that you often mention on your show gary franchi at lone lantern uh mark dice with
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:24.380]  his resistance radio erin russo coming out and making these very important films i mean it really
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:29.020]  is important that uh people uh as you've said a number of times stop waiting for orders from
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:34.380]  headquarters and just join this leaderless resistance of spreading the truth i mean 9-11
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:39.580]  is a water station watershed issue for so many reasons um not the least of which is the larger
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:44.940]  issues towards which it points uh and it's a perfect you know they really left themselves
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:49.420]  overexposed here they really really did with this particular thing i think their hubris got the
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:53.980]  best of them and we now you know it's that proverbial soft spot up on the belly of the
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:43:00.300]  dragon we have to take this opportunity to reveal this horrific truth so that we can then go forward
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:04.940]  and dismantle all these other horrific truths of which this is but the most obvious precursor
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:09.900]  i totally agree but there's also a converse or the reverse of that or i guess the mirror image of
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:16.220]  that not only use 9-11 to break up on all the other truths but if you go okay did the government let
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:19.980]  black men die of and that evidence shows gave them syphilis when they didn't have enough test
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:25.260]  subjects and then allowed them to spread it to literally hundreds of thousands with the tuskegee
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:31.100]  experiment over 45 years in tuskegee alabama and surrounding states did the government radiate
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:36.380]  tens of thousands of american children in nuclear testing did they know asian orange would do this
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:45.340]  and they still used it did they in operation gladio engulf of tonkin and with the uss liberty
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:50.380]  and ajax and iran did our government stage attacks or claim attacks happen that didn't happen
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:55.340]  you see there's so many so many admissions in history where this has already gone on that's
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:59.500]  what i do with my film terror storm is we start i don't know if you've seen that film but we start
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:05.580]  out uh daniel showing over those that haven't seen it showing the admitted examples what does
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:09.260]  you think of terror storm oh i thought it was fantastic i mean you know and one of the reasons
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:15.820]  why it's so important is that it gives you uh gives it shows the the precedent setting either
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:20.300]  events or plans that have been made but were not actually carried out as in the case with operation
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:26.140]  northwood it just speaks to you know the types of minds that we are dealing with the kind of things
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:30.460]  that they will either do or that they will entertain doing in order to advance an agenda
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:35.820]  and it does not stop short of murdering civilians it does not stop short of attacking soft targets
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:40.860]  and you know as you say uh you know firefighters carrying dead children in their arms as in the
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:44.940]  case with the oklahoma city bombing is something that does get the public really really upset
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:51.260]  and willing to do almost anything to protect what they perceive to be security so you've looked at
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:57.420]  oklahoma what's your view on that um you know i i i don't want to i actually have not done
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:45:02.380]  as even a tenth of the research on the oklahoma city bombing as i have done on 9 11 so i i'm
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:07.180]  afraid i can't really speak with any real you know in with a very informed opinion on it you've
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:13.180]  got questions at all serious questions serious questions i mean starting with the i'd following
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:17.900]  the pattern that i uh the the uh the path that i took with 9 11 i started in the oklahoma city
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:24.460]  bombing uh my research regarding that with um just the physical inconsistencies the physical
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:30.300]  evidence you know how does a a truck filled with fertilizer uh you know create the kind of damage
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:34.780]  that you saw there in the wreckage of the oklahoma city bombing uh what about uh i don't
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:37.980]  remember the woman her name but you've mentioned that there's a woman who worked in the building
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:43.020]  who saw these guys dressed up and you know uh i don't know hazmat suits or something with sticks
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:48.460]  of grape butter yeah jane graham you know i mean you know uh again i haven't done a lot of research
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:53.260]  into that but sounds just as suspicious in many of the very same ways you can see the same
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:58.460]  fingerprints all over that job uh as we find all over the 9 11 inside well i mean the point i made
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:02.620]  yesterday is really elementary but it needs to be made again and because i i mean a lot of us
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:06.460]  don't consciously think about the different mindset of the military leadership and and that's
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:10.780]  definitely the type of mind you know the type of mo uh the type of individuals we're talking about
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:18.140]  i mean they'll send 10 20 000 troops into a uh battle uh into a position that's untenable or
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:24.860]  undefended just to suck in the enemy to attack them and i mean that's just a 101 no guilt goes
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:31.100]  into it no thought goes into it no remorse goes into it it's a no-brainer it's military tactics
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:37.260]  it's what you do in in big battle settings and so for that same mindset those same individuals
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:42.940]  is it any stretch to think that they would kill 3 000 americans and and others who were there
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:49.740]  but the majority were americans on 9 11 at the pentagon and in new york city at the towers to
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:55.260]  get their whole new world order agenda basically cemented and get that foundation in place and then
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:47:02.540]  you've got the answer right there yeah yeah wow just don't say that it really is even at this
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:07.580]  point for me such a hard hole to swallow but you know no matter how much my uh there's a certain
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:14.380]  part of me that reacts against this not daunting knowledge uh i cannot ignore well that's number
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:17.340]  one because you're subconscious and the same with me i'm not saying you're afraid but you're
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:22.620]  subconscious senses the danger you like pull back from the flame uh the only way to defeat
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:25.580]  this flame is to grab it and smother and it's going to hurt it first but we're going to be
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:30.060]  consumed by it we don't so we've got to just grapple with it and then secondarily you wouldn't
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:35.740]  behave like that that isn't in your code that isn't in your heart and soul and so it's just so alien
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:40.300]  but i mean it's alien to think that ted monday would convince young women to get in the car
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:43.980]  with him so you could go tie them down and buy chunks out of them for five hours before he raped
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:47.820]  them and killed them exactly exactly you know it's really hard to believe that there are people
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:51.100]  out there in the world like that and you don't want to believe that they have their hands
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:56.220]  on the reins of power of your country but that is uh that is the horrible reality to which we are
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:48:00.540]  waking up but for them it isn't the you know the enjoyment i guess biting the chunks out i mean
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:05.180]  certainly some of them have that same mindset it's just cold-blooded as you know we always sacrifice
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:10.860]  people there's too many of them anyways you know yeah exactly according to according to some people
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:14.540]  well that's their whole religion and when you study prince burnhard and philip and
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:19.180]  all this scum let's take a quick call here let's talk to george george where you're calling us from
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:26.300]  today i'm from indiana welcome you're on the air with our guest go ahead thank you alex uh
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:31.500]  uh three things on 9 11 i was wondering there are two things on 9 11 and then a comment uh
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:37.580]  did they ever have any more information on the stolen 9 11 steel bob or mafia took or something
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:43.260]  well i mean they they cut it all up but but gps trackers on it wouldn't let the people
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:47.020]  stop even have lunch when they took it to the ships and most of it was taken to china
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:52.700]  some to south korea uh but now they found some in warehouses the government kept for some reason
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:57.420]  and we've been able to get samples from those and that shows that there are the the explosive
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:01.900]  compounds in their thermate uh do you want to comment on that daniel uh i don't know much
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:06.780]  about it i i'm uh actually it's new information to me the fact that they've actually found samples
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:11.180]  that were kept certainly fits the mo of criminals you know they just can't help themselves they have
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:16.540]  to keep some trinket of their you know trophy yeah some kind of trophy uh from the murder
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:22.540]  but um yeah you know alex have those samples that have been found actually have we been
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:26.300]  professed example for example has professor steven jones been given access to those samples
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:30.780]  has he actually let me be clear yeah there were several sites there's over 20 of them in the
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:35.900]  country one and i'll just tell you is in michigan one another's in new jersey another's in new york
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:41.420]  he's got lots of other samples and some of them we've been able to uh get from inside sources
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:46.460]  and we've seen the video tape that they shot of a couple warehouses in new york that does still
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:52.460]  have some of the steel and i really can't get into how we're getting this and i mean i mean i've just
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:50:00.860]  been told this by good sources sure sure sure sure another thing um uh i know doing an autopsy now
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:06.620]  might be difficult to see if uh there was a thermite or thermite left in a body but
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:13.500]  they could uh resume a dog and do a uh do an autopsy on that dog and see if there's
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:17.180]  thermite in the lung of that dog that had to breathe it i mean well i mean in court
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:24.380]  order for that there were femur bones blown 100 200 yards plus they found thousands of body parts
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:29.260]  they just found more last week week before that i mean bones were being blasted out of bodies these
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:33.660]  explosions were so big again if a building collapses number one it wouldn't fly out hundreds
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:39.260]  of yards number one i mean number two it wouldn't all be burned to a crisp uh and so all there was
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:43.660]  was little bitty body parts unless you know a few pieces that got excuse me even talking about this
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:47.740]  for family members that listen you know blown across the street i mean it's just like oklahoma
[01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:51.340]  city you got a truck bomb that supposedly blows into the building but the building blows out and
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:56.620]  blows chunks of it the opposite direction the truck bombs main blast on top of buildings across
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:51:02.460]  the street i mean it's just it's just it's so sloppy how they do this but again they count on
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:08.140]  us just buying into all of it thanks for the call rory you're up next and we keep our guests another
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:12.700]  five minutes into the next segment take a few more calls than let him go i've got to get him up again

[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:21.180]  our show again i you know i just want to say and i know you know this alex i didn't really
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:27.580]  come on the show to necessarily plug rescue me but why not uh well i mean it's the show
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:31.980]  when we come back on the air i believe it's tuesday nights at nine or ten and sometimes
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:36.380]  you know listings change so i would i guess tell your your viewers i guess check their local
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:41.180]  listings or what have you but um you know i think that it has in terms of most of what's on
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:47.580]  television i think that there's an inherent social relevance to rescue me's premise uh and uh i mean
[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:52.780]  i would love to see them address this directly although uh you know as fx is a subsidiary of
[01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:57.580]  fox i don't know if that will happen necessarily then you're you're rocco on the show for those
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:03.500]  who don't know yeah franco franco franco i was going for mango it's okay um yeah i don't watch
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:09.260]  a lot of tv myself but uh yeah that's that's when our show comes on and um you know i just hope that
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:14.220]  uh the fact that we're representing these guys on television will lend some maybe draw somebody's
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:17.980]  attention you know if they hear me say something about 9 11 being an inside job i really hope
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:21.580]  they'll do their own research that they'll go to infowars.com that they'll pick up a copy of
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:27.100]  terror storm or 9 11 mysteries or or any of the great documentaries that have been made exposing
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:31.820]  the inside job that 9 11 obviously was and you know research well fantastic and i totally agree
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:36.860]  with you uh one last question i should ask this before i mean when did you wake up to 9 11.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:42.700]  you know it didn't happen immediately you know my best friend joey uh he actually on the day was
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:45.980]  like that looked like an inside that he didn't say it looked like an inside job but he said
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:49.580]  these buildings looked like those things were brought down by controlled demolition he said
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:53.820]  it from the very beginning and i was like no i mean i kind of thought that it was just and i had
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:58.380]  known that i knew at that point about america's horrific history in terms of our foreign military
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:02.940]  and economic policy and i kind of looked at it uh as chickens coming home to roost in a certain
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:08.860]  sense uh even the targets made sense from that perspective but over time you know there i would
[01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:13.580]  hear a little bit of this i hear a little bit of that and i started you know the concern started
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:18.060]  welling up within me and i don't remember the exact moment but it was something about charlie
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:23.100]  sheen having coming out having uh come out publicly and then you know it's kind of a
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:28.940]  confluence of circumstances and coincidences i also remember you appearing in one of my favorite
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:33.740]  films by richard link later waking life didn't even know who you were when i saw the film but
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:37.500]  in hindsight uh when i was putting all these pieces together i was like oh
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:41.660]  that's the that was alex jones and then i you know listened to the radio that you conducted
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:45.740]  with charlie and it kind of took off from there for me i started then doing my own research and
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:51.820]  just had my mind blown day well and well what you're telling us dovetails i mean fits perfectly
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:56.700]  with with a paradigm i've seen and and it was the time charlie came along it was what 9-11 truth
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:01.820]  had already grown to and people really resonated with his courage because of his baggage and other
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:07.340]  things you know knowing that he hadn't you know a lot to lose doing this and it really did trigger
[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:11.980]  a chain reaction and then it was his idea to have the conference that got put on c-span four times
[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:17.340]  built a big audience by the fourth showing all the other things that happened uh and and that's
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:24.540]  now caused rosie and ebersole and so many others to go public and and me and brolin and yourself
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:29.740]  and and then now all these pilots and all these cia people and all these other folks are there
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:35.500]  is a mass exodus out of the lie into the truth and again sir i think you're actually early on
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:40.380]  uh in the avalanche uh that we're going to be seeing it looks like an avalanche now but i assure
[01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:45.660]  you uh if things continue it's going to be even bigger so daniel i really want to thank you for

[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:28.380]  been given a sack of gold or something you know it's wonderful it is hey i just want to relate
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:33.660]  something to you about the depths of government involvement in our in our personal lives here in
[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:38.220]  canada and actually this is happening all over the world sure tell us about it um i i just had
[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:44.700]  a baby girl two weeks ago beautiful baby girl and we had to go to great lengths just to have a
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:51.900]  natural birth uh the hospital here the cesarean section rate is 49 percent and a lot of people
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:56.700]  think that's just normal you know no that's because they make about five times more money
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:02:01.980]  off of it and it's not needed and it's actually caused higher infant mortality and more women to
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:05.900]  die i have the numbers but they're not going to stop and one day it'll be the law that you got
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:11.580]  to have your babies cut out well you're i'm glad you're well you're always good in our church alex
[02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:18.060]  um the so we thought we would have a midwife and here the midwives are part of the government
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:24.380]  program um they my wife would have been transferred they have about 30 percent cesarean section rate
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:29.340]  where they shipped off to the hospital she had a two-day labor which is actually normal you know
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:34.220]  that's that's fine it was a healthy birth we had to get a midwife who's unregistered who can't call
[02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:38.380]  herself a midwife because it's illegal because that name is now owned by the government she's
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:43.020]  delivered a thousand babies she was a midwife before the that was controlled by the government
[02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:49.260]  she refused to be regulated she went to jail because she took the the blood pressure of a
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:54.460]  of a mother and the heart rate of a baby and so we had to pay her out of pocket i mean you know
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:59.180]  here it's socialized medicine right so whatever and we had to get somebody who went to jail just
[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:06.780]  to have a natural birth in it's 95 cesarean section rate in brazil in in private hospitals
[02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:12.780]  it's going to be that it's going in that direction in australia it's just sick and wrong and it really
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:19.500]  hurts your wife and it also brings down the number of children that your wife can have
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:24.700]  uh you know after one or two cesareans they tell you don't have anymore yeah and it's it's just an
[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:30.060]  absolute travesty but no i mean in another generation they'll say it's an al-qaeda lie
[02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:36.300]  babies were always removed they always had machines that did it this is the one no i mean
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:40.540]  that's how they operate they'll say it's al-qaeda that it's al-qaeda i mean i'm being halfway
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:45.900]  sarcastic but i'm not really they'll say it's al-qaeda it's a sure al-qaeda sign to have your
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:51.900]  baby uh the normal way now certainly i'm all feeling i mean there were 10 15 20 percent
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:56.460]  mortality rates it wasn't that in ancient times it went up higher during the medieval and other
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:01.980]  periods uh because of sanitation and other problems uh but uh but then other countries
[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:05.660]  had to figure it out like the dutch and stuff they had the woman like the africans do shit on
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:10.460]  a chair and you're talking about just a few hours number one this is laying on the back business
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:17.340]  that's not how women had babies thousands of years ago oh and but uh but uh another another
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:24.620]  thing is they uh they give women these uh glucose um ivs and what what is that i've got my wife
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:27.900]  here what does that do again the glucose it raises the blood sugar the baby right yeah it's actually
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:34.300]  like the baby hospital every day yeah and and then it causes the baby's blood sugar to crash
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:41.420]  when the baby is born then they get to put in the uh NICU and suck a tripling out of you how can
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:47.100]  you be 33 years old and have figured all of this out no no no i i experienced it with our first
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:53.980]  child i've actually i've actually lived it brother okay hey um if it wasn't for you i'd be completely
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:58.700]  nuts because this is the only place where there's where people are telling the truth well not the
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:02.620]  only place but one of the few so well we try i mean we don't get it all right but i appreciate
[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:06.860]  your call in fact here's a correction in the first hour i talked about the templars being killed in
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:11.420]  the 15th century i immediately said though that wasn't right i had to get the day i knew it was
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:19.260]  either 12th or 13th i don't know why i said 15th it was october 13th 1307 when the knights templars

[02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:37.580]  well the glass has a natural resonance if the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate
[02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:41.820]  is big enough the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters using

[02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:38.380]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:49.580]  richard ken lori trent everybody we're going to get your calls but i got a rule if somebody
[02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:55.660]  disagrees and he just called in but you got to be fair here that's my rule they go to the front of
[02:08:55.660 --> 02:09:00.940]  the line let's see if he really disagrees john in new york go ahead uh alex this is john from
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:07.020]  new york and i have to offer some corrective information about the cfr if i may the council
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:12.700]  on foreign relations go ahead the council on foreign relations was started in 1921 and this
[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:18.300]  was a result of the united states senate refusing to ratify the treaty of Versailles and that would
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:23.500]  have taken the united states into the league of nations yeah okay so what are you what do you
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:32.060]  let me keep going and the very first thing that the cfr did was to purchase the policy
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:39.660]  not the not the newspaper itself but the policy of all the major newspapers in the country and as
[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:48.540]  uh media through radio and and talking movies and tv evolved they just got into those uh avenues as
[02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:55.260]  well now i have two sources that that i can offer for documentation of this information if i'd like
[02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:59.580]  to give them if i may yeah you you've got the floor but i want to be clear here that we don't
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:03.740]  disagree about anything i mean people are going to think that i don't agree with what you just said
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:08.700]  because you've made the spurious claim that that you disagree with something what specifically you
[02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:13.340]  disagree with me on well you i think it's important when you talk about the cfr in the
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:17.660]  media this isn't something that's just evolved in the last few decades this is the very first thing
[02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:23.580]  that they did well i i didn't say that which excuse me then right but i want well i don't
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:27.980]  want you to say excuse me i i just we're in agreement my friend you what you're saying is all
[02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:31.740]  uh true from what i know i mean i don't know about every policy but i know they
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:36.700]  yeah i mean they have the heads of every major media institution already that's who the british
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:41.020]  intelligence helped set it up because the league of nations with will grow wilson's uh and mandel
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:45.820]  house's plan failed and they've written about it themselves and they admitted and they're in
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:50.700]  control of the big five really big four now media conglomerates in every major newspaper
[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:58.620]  and i said the corporate good old boys in the cfr because of their intersecting uh interest
[02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:03.740]  that's why they set that up and that and and they set it up to control things and consolidate things
[02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:08.380]  further and that's sure enough happened i totally agree with you i mean that's an absolute i think
[02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:13.900]  it's important that people understand that this happened all the way back in 1921 and and that's
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:18.780]  when that's when the process started it didn't just happen you know like i said in the last few
[02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:23.420]  decades and that's that's the that's really the point that i wanted to make so that people
[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:28.140]  understand how far this has gone back well what you ought to do and i'm serious because you are
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:34.540]  very knowledgeable is write up a two-page article with the basic facts with a good headline email
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:39.900]  it to erin and info wars dot com email it to watson at prison planet dot com we need more
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:45.100]  content we need more information we'll scan your article and if it's good material and frankly
[02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:49.820]  the stuff the stuff you send us is good material but a most of what we get we don't have permission
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:55.660]  to post uh by you we just get it b uh you know you haven't slapped a headline on it so we don't
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:12:01.180]  want to do that for you because it's your words let me just tell you something i go to dig every
[02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:04.300]  day and we're going to set up our own message boards and stuff i just want something really
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:08.300]  good i don't want to just watch some junk so people email us tell us what you think we ought
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:14.860]  to set up what we ought to have uh we're doing all that right now but to make a long story short
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:20.060]  i go to because we link to dig then people go and post on the message board and try to vote our
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:24.380]  stories up but we're banned from dig being in the top so it doesn't matter we get five thousand
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:28.940]  we're not allowed to be in the top it's censored but still we don't care we're infesting dig uh
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:34.460]  people are going to find the material but i read like five page post basically or one page post
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:39.740]  of eloquent intelligent well-spoke just incredible stuff much better than i
[02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:46.140]  i mean let me just stop because i'm saying something here i mean just amazing stuff i mean
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:55.900]  incredible writers the wit uh the the the eternal phrase the the connections the research and only
[02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:01.500]  a few thousand people are reading those posts you need to write that up for us ladies and gentlemen
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:06.700]  you need to send it to us and authorize us to post it as stories because then millions will
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:11.820]  read it i'm telling you the stuff i see on message boards it's either you're a bunch of idiots who
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:18.300]  need to die and go to fema camps or you know sophomoric level idiocy or it's genius level
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:23.420]  writing and i guess those people posting must not be listening to the show uh because you know i've
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:27.500]  been putting this call out and i'm not getting stories from these people send them to us sorry
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:32.300]  you go ahead now uh the only other thing i'd like to do is offer these two sources of information
[02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:38.140]  that i have if that's okay with you sure take your time go ahead okay the first is a book and
[02:13:38.140 --> 02:13:47.260]  it's the title is called the shadows of power and the author is james pierloft the second is a video
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:53.420]  that is narrated by john mcmannis of the jbs and both of the book and the video are available
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:14:00.940]  through the bookstore at jbs and and people who are really interested in uh discovering and
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:05.500]  learning about the evolution of the cfr and they're the most horrible organization in the
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:12.060]  country uh need to get those two books and or that that book and that video and and they can
[02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:16.620]  get right to it sure i appreciate your call since since we've had endless plugs for other books and
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:21.660]  videos today i think we're going to even exist and be here you know i've had mcmannis on i've
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:25.500]  been nice to them but they've sniped at me and they've never retracted it like they said they
[02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:29.740]  were going to do and they shoot their mouth off about me on radio shows so much can tell you right
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:35.580]  now the jbs is a suspect organization and i reserve judgment on it i said i'd wait and see
[02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:40.620]  uh what they were going to do and they were going to retract things and i've seen a little bit
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:46.460]  towards that with saying yeah now they question 9 11 uh but i want to see retractions about some
[02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:50.780]  stuff that was said about me a few years ago i haven't seen that yet you know i i was the one
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:56.460]  assaulted by them that i had mcmannis on this show and then i've seen further stuff after it
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:03.900]  so i'm gonna now i think the jbs members are great people and i think the jbs members are doing
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:09.420]  yeoman's work and the jbs is helping at what couple states now have passed resolutions against
[02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:14.860]  the north american union and and so i got mixed feelings about them and then i get beat up by
[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:20.700]  other talk show host on this very network because i won't come out in a g hot or i guess the word
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:25.260]  could be crusaded against the jbs which i think would be destructive i'm not into infighting
[02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:29.820]  folks it's not my mo but i've gone to the point in my life where i just don't like to hold back
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:36.700]  on people anymore i mean i'll be frank with you uh and uh if somebody hits me knocks me upside
[02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:41.260]  the head i'm gonna say something back to them but we need to stop sniping and other patriots
[02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:45.020]  and we need to all work together and that's what i've tried to do bearing the hatchet
[02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:50.300]  when i've been hacked in the head uh you know with the leadership of the jbs and i've seen
[02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:54.220]  some encouraging things happen but i've also seen some discouraging things but yes i've read that
[02:15:54.220 --> 02:15:59.500]  book by pearl off and i've seen the video we put it on access tv a few years ago bunch of videos
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:03.980]  they made they're excellent uh of course i plug them all the time probably you know sold thousands
[02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:09.500]  of videos for them why do i get returned absolutely squat but that's what i'm here for i'm here to be
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:14.220]  used and drug to the mud because i don't care i literally am folks i'm here to get a job done
[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:20.780]  and i don't care if i'm in the gutter uh but i've spent two hours and 15 minutes and 52 seconds and
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:23.820]  i haven't really plugged my films yet i'm gonna spend 60 seconds now because i want to go to your
[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:27.980]  calls and cover news and i've literally got a giant stack of incredible important news here
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:33.740]  i'm gonna attempt to cover it then i'll be back sunday on the radio four to six p.m central live
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:38.780]  and you can listen to me on kelby j 590 from southern oklahoma down to mexico and there's
[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:42.380]  about i don't know like 15 other affiliates picking us up a few more have been calling
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:46.780]  want to pick it up it's a pretty successful little show for just starting off uh but um
[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:55.260]  you know we need your support i uh i put my films out for free on google video yes i mean i
[02:16:55.260 --> 02:17:01.100]  actually upload the film for free there you can see it in better quality it looks a lot better
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:05.660]  a lot clearer and download it to disk and burn it and make copies for people we have a prism planet
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:11.980]  dot tv membership and i get emails saying why isn't it free uh i spend tens of thousands of
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:17.820]  dollars on it every month okay i mean money comes in here and boy but believe me uh 96 percent of it
[02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:24.700]  goes right back out and uh we could do so much more if we had the capital to do it and no i
[02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:29.740]  cannot uh promote people who get who sell my videos that are bootlegged i mean i can let you
[02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:35.100]  bootleg them but i sure can't promote it on my own show i get criticized for that because think
[02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:40.940]  think there won't be any more videos if that continues um i mean my goal is to defeat these
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:47.260]  people but i'm just telling you how it is uh i got a hustle and sell some more advertising have some
[02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:51.820]  more ads on the show i don't like having to do that but if that's what it takes to finance my
[02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:57.340]  operation if i literally have to finance films with advertising so i can lose money on films
[02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:03.020]  i will do it i will make films folks to the point of robbing banks and i mean that figuratively
[02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:10.460]  okay i don't care about money it's fiat dirt i like a car that runs well under me i like a house
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:14.220]  that's you know warm in the winter and cool in the summer but i mean i'm not it's not my totem

[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:36.540]  that we've got uh in our uh you know world out there now even if we're successful on 9 11 here
[02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:42.540]  before too long it sure is going to take a lot of additional education and additional undoing
[02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:48.940]  if even it can be undone to try to correct what's been done already well humans in life have lived
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:54.540]  in a in a vat of radiation forever and the radiation is a problem is poisonous and toxic
[02:25:54.540 --> 02:26:01.900]  and radioactive but frankly from the studies i've seen and what i've looked at here genetically
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:08.060]  modifying major food crops that then infest all the other similar strains like basically all
[02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:12.940]  corn's now been infected every major strain on earth is found to have this in it and you know
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:18.700]  different strains have higher levels of it with live pesticide we have an elite that that grows
[02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:22.540]  corn that kills bugs and then we just eat it we want to roll the honeybees are dying because
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:26.220]  they're eating the pollen and that's just one of these they're they're putting pesticides in most
[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:31.100]  of the food crops now because even you don't have to spray with pesticides this is all these
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:36.700]  bastards avoid it you know avoid ingesting this stuff themselves literally uh literally senator
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:43.740]  rockefeller admittedly has his own farms and has a whole chain uh to bring him and his family
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:49.500]  nothing but fresh food he cooked himself and they bring containers of of food and a chef everywhere
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:55.020]  he goes david rockefeller is the same uh the queen of the netherlands the queen of england i just
[02:26:55.020 --> 02:27:00.220]  watched like a two-hour documentary for research on uh the house of winsor and on uh on prince
[02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:05.500]  philip was just on one particular palace i was actually bucking him a couple others i forget the
[02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:11.180]  point is is it was all about prince philip and that's all he has his own farms on his own palace
[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:17.420]  that's all he eats uh his own meat everything it's all specially certified now they they love
[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:24.060]  multiple times filter all their water they haul it with them everywhere they go this is their sick
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:29.100]  eugenics operation against us they've done all this by design these people are the scum of the
[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:35.180]  earth well i'm sure he wants to avoid that virus he dreams he could be well that's the thing uh
[02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:39.820]  listen here's an example prince burnhard had an operation in south africa supposedly and then in
[02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:44.940]  zimbabwe to kill all the elephant poachers but it turned out he his people were actually running the
[02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:51.420]  elephant poaching op and uh and involved in trying to support you know different programs down there
[02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:56.860]  it's always the opposite of what they say these people are i mean i just keep saying they're just
[02:27:57.020 --> 02:28:02.780]  they're psychopaths their religion though is being control freaks and not letting us have good lives
[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:08.620]  and killing us and devil worship and uh pedophile and all the rest of that sinister just unbelievable

[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:04.460]  followed up by the hold their feet to the fire talk radio rally
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:10.700]  are you going to participate in that in any capacity well i can't participate in everything
[02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:17.660]  uh you know um but uh i mean i'll try i mean i'm participating right now i'm on the radio
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:23.820]  you're on the air plugging it all right uh the new york daily news reported the news by the way
[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:29.820]  is another neo-con warmonger newspaper owned by mortimer zuckerman who also owns u.s news
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:35.740]  and world report and they reported that the washington post reported recently that rupert
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:44.700]  murdoch claims that michael bloomberg is his man for president and i really find that kind of
[02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:49.740]  interesting and not it doesn't matter whether it's that mobster his father was an admitted mob boss
[02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:55.900]  juliani and people from new york email mingle so what you know so you get things done and oh yeah
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:59.500]  i can't bribe him can't control it that's really a great idea to have a mobster because they're all
[02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:05.580]  mob the bushes the clintons uh it doesn't nip romney uh just all new world order trash barack
[02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:10.140]  obama i mean people are asking what i think of these people they're all new world order period
[02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:13.500]  that's why they're being promoted you notice the media really tries to black out ron paul
[02:43:14.220 --> 02:43:20.220]  right bailey tancredo too like they don't even exist but what's interesting most well let's be
[02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:24.300]  clear tom tancredo doesn't hold a candle he hadn't been in the same league as ron paul
[02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:29.100]  okay let's be clear about that and i know tom he's been on a few times
[02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:32.460]  and i mean he's better than most of them and i don't think he's an evil new world order
[02:43:32.460 --> 02:43:36.140]  but he has bombed the snot out of the arabs you know he is wrong on that
[02:43:36.140 --> 02:43:40.860]  that's why i probably um won't support him for president and i will why i would support paul
[02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:47.500]  but bloomberg is thinking about an independent run and he is denied it up until this time and
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:52.940]  then when i read that in the daily news about murdoch saying that this is his man as an
[02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:59.020]  independent well we know murdoch's man isn't a man murdoch's man is a woman it's hillary clinton
[02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:05.580]  fundraisers for and roger ailes is advising her campaign fun russell embossed papa i appreciate
[02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:10.940]  your call my friend okay so yeah they do have bloomberg run it'll be a shock republican votes
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:16.780]  to ensure the princess wins and that that whore and that's what she is she's a new world war
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:22.620]  who sold out this country she'll end up being your president and god help us the reign of
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:27.740]  terror you think it's been bad so far and i will not vote for a republican against her i say bring
[02:44:27.740 --> 02:44:32.060]  the judgment on america i will not vote for some lesser of two evils because there is no such thing
[02:44:32.060 --> 02:44:38.620]  as lesser okay and believe me when she's president you'll try to tell republicans that she's
[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:44.780]  republican control and they'll just laugh at you they're such scum yeah your whore limbaugh is
[02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:49.660]  behind her they're all in bed together uh the clinton's vacation with the bushes it's staged

[02:46:56.780 --> 02:47:00.460]  this i'm a stuff which i'm starting to think might have been a part of something large not
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:04.460]  that he was not that i was was part of it may have been probably not but that but that i i
[02:47:04.460 --> 02:47:10.220]  said two days ago i said you watch they're gonna go shift all this now onto rosie uh they've all
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:14.220]  been saying on the media that we need to start firing everybody now and now they're calling for
[02:47:14.220 --> 02:47:23.420]  rosie to be fired this is aol news after imus delay calls for rosie to be fired and this is
[02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:28.300]  fanning the flames of discontent sparked by imus controversy former congressman tom delay is making
[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:33.500]  a plea to his fellow conservatives to get rosie o'donald fired for recent remarks she made you
[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:37.980]  don't know what's going on behind the scenes with rosie do you i know a little bit okay and it isn't
[02:47:37.980 --> 02:47:43.660]  good okay do you think people maybe get threats do you think maybe their children get threatened
[02:47:43.660 --> 02:47:48.060]  do you think maybe their job gets threatened she's already had courage do you know what charlie sheen
[02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:53.660]  went through being called every dirty name in the book on tv and that was an rnc dirty trick by the
[02:47:53.660 --> 02:47:57.900]  way i happen to know the details but he didn't want he doesn't want himself to be defended
[02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:01.660]  okay so i appreciate your call and i understand you're saying what are they waiting for
[02:48:02.220 --> 02:48:07.900]  okay what are the people that haven't gone public waiting for you know this is scary stuff
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:11.660]  and they do need to come public uh but um
[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:23.020]  oh it's just you know oh man and i kind of gave the whole thing away there because i wasn't
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:28.540]  thinking you know because i start talking about why isn't rosie done more uh and some other people
[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:33.980]  which well just you know what why didn't kurt ronig go public about knowing 9 11's an inside job
[02:48:34.940 --> 02:48:40.460]  you know why was and then if somebody didn't want people to know his full opinion about it
[02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:45.900]  should i go on air and tell you or maybe that wasn't his opinion you know i i just don't want
[02:48:45.900 --> 02:48:49.820]  to betray people and i don't want to sit here i could sit here and list some really big names to
[02:48:49.820 --> 02:48:55.500]  you right now okay but the media will call them up and they'll probably deny it and they'll make
[02:48:55.500 --> 02:49:01.180]  even remember going public you know i can't sit here and burn people and i'm not going to do it
[02:49:01.180 --> 02:49:04.300]  and hey look in the mirror it's up to us to go public and get the word out
[02:49:05.340 --> 02:49:09.740]  okay let's go ahead and take another one here let's talk to trent in new york you're on the
[02:49:09.740 --> 02:49:15.500]  air go ahead hi alex uh i'm actually calling from houston um okay whatever i was told new
[02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:18.540]  york you're calling from the united states go ahead sir okay yeah i just want to bring up two
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:23.660]  quick points um the first one is something that i recently read about tommy franks discussing uh
[02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:28.140]  what he thinks is the worst thing that can happen to our country and what it is but let me see you
[02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:32.380]  don't expect him to come out and say martial law is great g we won he says oh it's so terrible
[02:49:32.380 --> 02:49:36.140]  the terrorists are probably going to attack and then the people are going to want a new form of
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:42.220]  government a military government oh it's too bad and that's exactly what he knows is is up you know
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:46.860]  the next thing to happen to us um he just clearly mentions that the people are going to be so scared
[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:51.180]  they're going to be willing to give up their constitutional liberties and uh it just goes to
[02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:54.860]  show how serious this whole thing is and i'll be real quick here i just want everyone to know if
[02:49:54.860 --> 02:49:59.820]  you go to wikipedia and look up tommy franks you can see this for yourself and see how real it is
[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:04.620]  and the second point i just wanted to uh bring up is that i live in a town that's right outside of
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:10.300]  houston it's a very small town called porter and recently i've noticed the cops it seems like they
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:15.260]  have been up to some really fishy stuff almost like they're practicing for setting up roadblocks
[02:50:15.260 --> 02:50:20.140]  or something um like yesterday i saw like six or seven cops that were just hovering around this
[02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:24.620]  little two-lane road why do you think they're hiring more and more more more and more and more
[02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:29.980]  no no no sir you have to look it up they admit they i mean and i appreciate your call i mean
[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:37.580]  they admit all this this is admitted and i told the cops go ahead do it go ahead i mean you want
[02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:44.780]  to kill the country just sit there you like to have power you like to do all this you are
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:50.220]  literally you know i said this last week and some idiot sent me a threatening email about i don't
[02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:57.100]  like you threatening people i'm gonna call the police on you i filed it i don't want violence
[02:50:57.100 --> 02:51:01.500]  i don't want it to turn into a bunch of dead cops and military on the streets when they try to bring
[02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:06.460]  in this new world order a new order that's going to take their pension funds and shoot their kids
