[00:00.000 --> 00:06.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[00:06.600 --> 00:10.000]  a war on for your mind.
[00:10.000 --> 00:16.400]  Well, it's the big New York primary day and a whole bunch of other states as well.
[00:16.400 --> 00:19.400]  We'll be breaking it down here over the next four hours than tonight.
[00:19.400 --> 00:24.000]  We'll have extended live coverage kicking off at 7 o'clock central infowarsnews.com.
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.000]  We'll have free video feeds for everybody at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  I'll be telling you about that throughout the broadcast and sending you the links via
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.320]  infowars.com forward slash newsletter if you've signed up for free newsletter so we can send
[00:39.320 --> 00:42.400]  you news alerts and other key intel.
[00:42.400 --> 00:47.640]  Wow, we've got another big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:47.640 --> 00:54.440]  Billy Corgan, Patriot, Anti-New World Order Crusader, and of course a guy that sold 40
[00:54.440 --> 01:00.720]  million albums, the creator of Smashing Pumpkins and so many other mega hit bands.
[01:00.720 --> 01:06.920]  We'll be joining us in studio today and he's playing here tonight in Austin, Texas, Billy
[01:06.920 --> 01:07.920]  Corgan.
[01:07.920 --> 01:08.920]  We'll be in studio.
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.960]  Leanne McAdoo just split five minutes ago to go pick him up downtown.
[01:13.960 --> 01:14.960]  She's a fan of Billy.
[01:14.960 --> 01:15.960]  He's a fan of her.
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.160]  He's a fan of the whole operation and so I look for her to also be interviewing him
[01:20.160 --> 01:25.840]  for the infowars nightly news and who knows, maybe more in the future.
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.840]  Maybe more.
[01:26.840 --> 01:33.960]  So we've got all of that to be breaking down today and we have Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the
[01:33.960 --> 01:39.600]  vindicated hero in studio.
[01:39.600 --> 01:46.200]  Of course, Robert De Niro saw the film that was produced and shot in this building to
[01:46.200 --> 01:50.320]  a certain extent here in Austin, Texas in the info war studios.
[01:50.320 --> 01:51.320]  I'm not behind it.
[01:51.320 --> 01:54.760]  I'm not a producer of it, but I let them use some of the equivalent studios, I believe,
[01:54.760 --> 01:57.040]  in the cause of exposing it.
[01:57.040 --> 02:00.400]  And the federal government came, a quote, high government official came and threatened
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.480]  Robert De Niro at his Tribeca Film Festival that he founded, I don't know, was it 16 years
[02:04.480 --> 02:06.360]  ago and they canceled it.
[02:06.360 --> 02:10.320]  But De Niro has come out and said everyone should see the film.
[02:10.320 --> 02:14.400]  And so Dr. Wakefield will give us all the inside baseball, but it turns out that when
[02:14.400 --> 02:19.000]  they said he was discredited and lied about it in that big hoax a decade ago, that they
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.840]  knew of two studies in England previously done by the government that were secret that
[02:23.840 --> 02:31.200]  had the exact same findings as Dr. Wakefield, who is a pioneer.
[02:31.200 --> 02:34.720]  And then of course it was in the New York Times and all over the news the last few months
[02:34.720 --> 02:42.600]  that gut flora connected to toxic brain syndrome connected to autism.
[02:42.600 --> 02:44.200]  And oh, what did Wakefield find?
[02:44.200 --> 02:50.240]  Measles, mumps, rubella, antibodies for one or all three, one, two or three, sometimes
[02:50.240 --> 02:59.120]  all of them, in the gut connected to a chain reaction die off of flora and a toxic brew
[02:59.120 --> 03:00.120]  in your gut.
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.280]  That's why you drink beer to get drunk, folks, that's why you haven't eaten, you get a headache.
[03:03.280 --> 03:07.640]  Other brain and stomach are connected, that's why your brain follows your gut says my gut
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.720]  doesn't like the way this feels because you've got brain ganglia, nerve endings all down
[03:13.720 --> 03:19.280]  in your spine and in your gut, just like a brachiosaur had a big brain in its head and
[03:19.280 --> 03:21.960]  another brain in its back.
[03:21.960 --> 03:28.360]  Now scientists think it has many as five brains, well mammals have got all sorts of
[03:28.360 --> 03:37.640]  upper brain cerebral cortex right down into the lower brain right down through the spine
[03:37.640 --> 03:39.680]  but I'm digressing.
[03:39.680 --> 03:44.440]  He's going to be joining us today to break it all down because they've now officially
[03:44.440 --> 03:49.720]  vindicated his scientist partner and now he is in the process of having the courts admit
[03:49.720 --> 03:55.000]  he was wronged and set up and he is suing people so it's a long hard fight but we will
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  expose the vaccines.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.440]  I mean it's come out, ABC News, 14 years ago there was a secret meeting in 2000, it came
[04:02.440 --> 04:10.840]  out in 2002, there was a secret meeting in 2000 at the Centers for Disease Control and
[04:10.840 --> 04:14.000]  they have the minutes of it where they have the CDC and all the scientists are going I'm
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.600]  not giving my grandkids this now, we've got millions damaged, this is going to be a rebellion
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.160]  on our hands, we've got to cover this up and I guess to their credit they at least say
[04:23.160 --> 04:28.320]  we've got to somehow reach out to the vaccine makers who've got liability protection and
[04:28.320 --> 04:34.400]  say look you've got to clean this up, I mean this is a public health disaster but of course
[04:34.400 --> 04:39.640]  it didn't get cleaned up, it's worse because it's by design, the CDC people don't know
[04:39.640 --> 04:43.360]  that but it is.
[04:43.360 --> 04:48.600]  Deadly immunity, government cover up of mercury autism scandal, ABC News, alright we're going
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.640]  to be back ladies and gentlemen straight ahead, I told you a few days ago Donald Trump would
[04:52.640 --> 04:59.760]  be doubling down on 9-Eleven Truth, he did it, he did it today this morning on Fox.
[04:59.760 --> 05:06.560]  Jobs related to the manufacturing and sell of guns increased 73% since 2008 to a nationwide
[05:06.560 --> 05:13.200]  total of nearly 290,000, the National Shooting Sports Foundation has revealed, these are
[05:13.200 --> 05:19.520]  good jobs, paying an average of $50,000 in wages and benefits and today every job is
[05:19.520 --> 05:24.600]  important the foundation reported, not only does the manufacture and sell of firearms
[05:24.600 --> 05:29.800]  and hunting supplies create good jobs in the United States but the industry also contributes
[05:29.800 --> 05:36.560]  to the economy as a whole, in fact in 2015 the firearms and ammunition industry was responsible
[05:36.560 --> 05:43.720]  for as much as $49 billion in total economic activity in the country, ironically California
[05:43.720 --> 05:49.760]  is second only to Texas in firearm job growth and another anti-gun state Illinois is also
[05:49.760 --> 06:18.840]  in the top 10, you can find more reports on infowars.com.

[07:08.120 --> 07:13.400]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking
[07:13.400 --> 07:18.000]  iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.120]  the water, they took the good halogen M and put the deadly halogen M and when the Fukushima
[07:23.120 --> 07:28.280]  crisis worsened as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[07:28.280 --> 07:34.480]  and your family, now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection

[08:16.520 --> 08:40.680]  So the
[08:40.680 --> 08:48.600]  Corrigan is going to be dropping some major truth bombs, I talked to him last night, he
[08:48.600 --> 08:51.400]  said that he wants to really just put the message out that folks need to realize that
[08:51.400 --> 08:58.320]  many of them are in a trance and it's time to break the trance and start really living.
[08:58.320 --> 09:02.320]  So we're going to be talking about social justice warriors a lot more, some of the things
[09:02.320 --> 09:06.640]  he's doing with smashing pumpkins but also other bands that he's created and where he
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.840]  sees the world going, a really smart guy doesn't give a lot of interviews and that's because
[09:11.840 --> 09:16.360]  he does not like the system and that's why the mainstream media likes to attack him
[09:16.360 --> 09:20.640]  because they know that he is basically a pro human libertarian, good friend of mine Billy
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.360]  Corrigan, smashingpumpkinsnexus.com, he's playing here in Austin, Texas tonight, he's
[09:26.360 --> 09:29.840]  going to be in studio with us, Lee and Macadam is picking him up right now downtown bringing
[09:29.840 --> 09:36.440]  him here, Dr. Andrew Wakefield the vindicated doctor and scientist that exposed the gut
[09:36.440 --> 09:43.320]  flora connection to autism that is now in major john hopkins studies, major harvard
[09:43.320 --> 09:49.000]  medical school studies it was in the new york times and the washington post as well as
[09:49.000 --> 09:58.800]  the wall street journal just in the last month with autism connection to the gut and cancer
[09:58.800 --> 10:05.000]  connection to gut flora die off and so much more everything that dr. wakefield 20 years
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.640]  ago exposed and then again seven or eight years ago they came out with a giant hoax
[10:10.640 --> 10:15.680]  saying everything was fraud and then he was discredited the mainstream media still had
[10:15.680 --> 10:22.680]  power to lie then and get hoaxes across and it almost destroyed him but now his partner
[10:22.680 --> 10:27.320]  has been officially vindicated in court he of course has moved to the united states here
[10:27.320 --> 10:33.380]  in austin his new movie fact a high level quote official came and personally threatened
[10:33.380 --> 10:37.880]  robert denaro denaro's now confirmed that and he canceled it out of the tribeca film
[10:37.880 --> 10:42.760]  festival he founded but denaro said last week and it was in an article on info wars dot
[10:42.760 --> 10:47.920]  com that he believes everyone should see the film faxed that again was shot to a great
[10:47.920 --> 10:55.320]  extent in the studios here in austin texas so we'll be talking faxed in studio with
[10:55.320 --> 11:00.640]  dr. Andrew wakefield just like they came out and i use this is one of the most egregious
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.720]  examples and they said alex jones says obama sent a tornado to Oklahoma city three years
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.080]  ago never said it caller asked if it was a weather weapon i said they don't really create
[11:10.080 --> 11:14.760]  specific tornadoes it's declassified they can create major weather fronts a lot of governments
[11:14.760 --> 11:18.960]  have this technology it's on the discovery channel the weather channel the history channel
[11:18.960 --> 11:23.760]  we had the father of weather weapons on first bin livingston right when it was declassified
[11:23.760 --> 11:30.280]  a decade ago and i said no i don't think it's an attack so they said that i said it was
[11:30.280 --> 11:35.560]  an attack it's not about defending myself it's about understanding how these deceivers
[11:35.560 --> 11:40.720]  operate they get on the news and say alex jones influenced the boston bombers and he's deeply
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.320]  racist and they didn't show a racist quote or how they were connected to me only that
[11:45.320 --> 11:51.640]  i was exposing their cia connection but need to be investigated i'm not saying the cia even
[11:51.640 --> 11:56.560]  did it but the russians blew their cover two years before they were on a state department
[11:56.560 --> 12:05.640]  fake ids they were both playboys boston bombing of course uh anniversary was yesterday this
[12:05.640 --> 12:10.080]  is how they misrepresent and they do it to donald trump i see articles everywhere and
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.180]  every time i turn the tv on now it's folks going it's horrible that he says mexicans
[12:15.180 --> 12:20.400]  are all criminals it's horrible he wants to deport all the hispanics none of that was
[12:20.400 --> 12:26.520]  ever said he said mexico's dumping a lot of his criminals on us here in the united states
[12:26.520 --> 12:29.800]  and that's wrong and people are coming here and having their kids for free and that's
[12:29.800 --> 12:35.040]  wrong and china's got a huge tariff on us and that's wrong that's why the power structure
[12:35.040 --> 12:40.840]  is so scared and it's such an endorsement of trump to have the communist chinese leadership
[12:40.840 --> 12:50.160]  and a who's who of other arch criminals arch killers world record regimes of evil all time
[12:50.160 --> 12:56.200]  most wicked from the kami pope to the mexican presidents to the british government the saudi
[12:56.200 --> 13:02.480]  arabian government they all hate donald trump because they know he's a nationalist and they've
[13:02.480 --> 13:07.120]  got intelligence files on donald trump and they know that he reads books on the private
[13:07.120 --> 13:11.640]  federal reserve and gave money to groups to audit the federal reserve 25 years ago and
[13:11.640 --> 13:17.800]  wanted to get us out of nafta and gad and is a closet patriot now i wasn't sure of that
[13:17.800 --> 13:22.080]  until the last few months when i talked to so many high level sources that say you didn't
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.840]  know donald trump has been into the new world order and things since before you were on
[13:27.840 --> 13:32.200]  air that's a dr coursey who's known him well for 40 years they've been in business together
[13:32.200 --> 13:38.320]  for 40 years in finance and in building projects course he's a big wig folks not just a three
[13:38.320 --> 13:42.080]  time number one new york times bestseller it's calling michael savage is one of the
[13:42.080 --> 13:50.600]  biggest supplement owners and rockstar energy and bestselling author all time under another
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.720]  name no one even knows all that it's like i use the example one time i said yeah chuck
[13:55.720 --> 13:59.400]  norris is a listener and we're talking to his people he's gonna come on the show and
[13:59.400 --> 14:05.360]  i got all these text messages and calls like who's chuck who's chuck norris well that's
[14:05.360 --> 14:09.120]  another story i know chuck norris is a listener he's been on i was i was conflating two great
[14:09.120 --> 14:16.560]  patriots and it's okay because their names are similar chuck yager i tell you teleprompter
[14:16.560 --> 14:21.080]  free here ladies and gentlemen teleprompter free so i get names mixed together that's
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.960]  how we make mistakes occasionally but that's good it keeps my my mind fresh and crackling
[14:25.960 --> 14:32.640]  here and a lot of times even correct myself midstream so dr andrew wakefield coming up
[14:32.640 --> 14:39.240]  billy corgan coming up and a lot more autism medical information and more will be broken
[14:39.240 --> 14:45.560]  down here today of huge magnitude and leon macadoo will also be popping in part of the
[14:45.560 --> 14:52.360]  time with us and billy corgan billy is gonna produce a film on americana and in search
[14:52.360 --> 14:57.360]  of americana he wants to interview me yours truly for it and i'm happy to be in the film
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.280]  it's got a pretty famous well-known successful documentary maker involved and i don't know
[15:02.280 --> 15:06.640]  how far he's gonna get into it today but he also has some ideas to do kind of some popular
[15:06.640 --> 15:13.120]  culture shows and that's exciting i'm just too busy you know quite frankly that's why
[15:13.120 --> 15:16.920]  i'm great i've got all these amazing reporters and other crew members that can then reach
[15:16.920 --> 15:22.440]  out and involve in these collaborative projects hopefully with so many amazing people we've
[15:22.440 --> 15:28.280]  got a lot of big collaborative projects that folks want us to do on national tv on broadcast
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.640]  tv on some of the biggest franchises out there and i'll just be quite frank with you that's
[15:33.640 --> 15:39.680]  success but i'm so busy with the day to day battle against the new world order that i've
[15:39.680 --> 15:50.440]  just been basically not following up on you know having a spot on big national tv shows
[15:50.440 --> 15:54.680]  which are fiction shows and that's where most people are actually getting their news and
[15:54.680 --> 16:01.360]  information is from fiction but in a way i think if i become involved in all of that
[16:01.360 --> 16:07.880]  i've already basically turned hollywood down once that i'll be captured by it whether i
[16:07.880 --> 16:19.400]  like it or not so it's almost like that's failure if i do accept hbo shows major movie
[16:19.400 --> 16:24.600]  roles and by the way i'm not up here bragging about all these offers i turned down or just
[16:24.600 --> 16:32.680]  don't follow up on i want everybody to know that liberty is super sexy and ultra popular
[16:32.680 --> 16:36.560]  in culture not just at the grassroots but through the establishment as well and a lot
[16:36.560 --> 16:41.160]  of people in the establishment do not like what's happening and they really want to try
[16:41.160 --> 16:45.880]  to turn things around as well but it's the very very top of the pyramid that is anti
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.960]  human and very destructive and it controls the issuance of currency and credit the big
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.880]  central banks and that's why we're in so much trouble no matter if the will of humanity
[16:54.880 --> 17:01.160]  wants to get out of this oppression and this dehumanization there is an unseen hand with
[17:01.160 --> 17:10.880]  an old seeing eye weaved in frame that is continuing to try to suppress human destiny
[17:10.880 --> 17:16.960]  but there's a great truth that's being borne out every day now as giant lies collapse into
[17:16.960 --> 17:22.040]  the dustbin of history and i want to explain something right now before we go to break
[17:22.040 --> 17:27.440]  and come back and get into all the news that is extremely profound and absolutely essential
[17:27.440 --> 17:39.360]  to understand if we're going to transcend our current position because through this microcosm
[17:39.360 --> 17:48.800]  it's a doorway into the understanding and perception of every other big problem we face
[17:48.800 --> 17:57.760]  the nine eleven commission came out and basically admitted they were ordered to rubber stamp
[17:57.760 --> 18:07.200]  a secretly written globalist report put together by zealocale and the neocons and the fact
[18:07.200 --> 18:10.760]  that six of the ten commissioners went public never really got a lot of attention until
[18:10.760 --> 18:18.960]  now it seismically is building but what's really profound is the congressional report
[18:18.960 --> 18:22.760]  got almost no attention before it and all the hundreds of whistleblowers that were
[18:22.760 --> 18:28.120]  arrested killed persecuted got almost no attention and those of us that would talk about all
[18:28.120 --> 18:34.200]  the whistleblowers we got demonized and the media would say that we were making it up
[18:34.200 --> 18:41.880]  never give any facts or misrepresent but the profound statement is this you can't stop
[18:41.880 --> 18:51.840]  the signal and nine eleven truth has now basically been certified been proven correct
[18:51.840 --> 18:55.960]  and the establishment has got some explaining to do as they say and you can't put that genie
[18:55.960 --> 19:02.880]  back in the bottle and what's even more profound about that overall statement is they did everything
[19:02.880 --> 19:06.480]  they could to suppress it everything they could to bully and now the Saudis have come
[19:06.480 --> 19:10.440]  out threatening to remove seven hundred and fifty billion dollars out of the United States
[19:10.440 --> 19:17.480]  showing how we're kept showing how we're controlled showing how we're slaves at least in their
[19:17.480 --> 19:23.360]  views but it's the Streisand effect you try to cover something up it only gives it that
[19:23.360 --> 19:27.840]  much more attention me thinks you protest too much something's rotten the state of Denmark
[19:27.840 --> 19:32.400]  and what's in the twenty eight pages has already come out because everybody's leaked it members
[19:32.400 --> 19:37.360]  of Congress have come on and told you colonels have come on and told you Congressman Walter
[19:37.360 --> 19:44.280]  Jones colonel Schaefer countless others so we know from every angle I mean look Dr. Pachinix
[19:44.280 --> 19:49.000]  been at the CFR well they sit around and openly discussed how they did it okay by the way

[37:48.400 --> 37:54.320]  on or i have a famous producer on or i have a top banker on or i have a the number two
[37:54.320 --> 38:00.360]  of the japanese government on or i have donald trump on that hits the audiences that are
[38:00.360 --> 38:05.840]  tuned in to that personality or that individual and that's how we reach more and more people
[38:05.840 --> 38:12.400]  in the fight against the globalist and their attempt to dehumanize the world population
[38:12.400 --> 38:16.120]  that's how we're doing it and i know i'm stating simple things here but that's why sending
[38:16.120 --> 38:23.080]  out the links is so important look 9 11 happened 15 years ago i knew it was coming i knew bin
[38:23.080 --> 38:28.080]  lovin was connected to western intelligence agencies i could see them hyping that there
[38:28.080 --> 38:36.240]  was about to be a imminent attack i knew that they were about to take our liberties when
[38:36.240 --> 38:41.640]  that imminent attack came they're putting out different ran corporation documents saying
[38:41.640 --> 38:45.360]  a huge catalyzing terror attacks coming when it does we're going to radically transform
[38:45.360 --> 38:48.960]  your world and basically get rid of freedom in america and launch a global corporate
[38:48.960 --> 39:00.360]  empire with u.s. government funding and then it all happened and they wrote the p-max document
[39:00.360 --> 39:06.480]  a year before 9 11 dick cheney and jeb bush did saying we need a large catalyzing terror
[39:06.480 --> 39:10.600]  attack that kills around 3000 people like pearl harbor they actually say on the order
[39:10.600 --> 39:15.200]  of pearl harbor boy got the number just right and that we're going to use that to quote
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.400]  cause a clash of civilizations but then in the next phase we don't defeat radical islam
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.880]  it's one thing if they staged it as an evil false flag for a greater good and a mackey
[39:24.880 --> 39:29.360]  of ellion injustifies the means to crush radical islam i would still be against it and say
[39:29.360 --> 39:35.240]  it was wrong obviously because nothing done in great evil for supposed good ever ends
[39:35.240 --> 39:43.480]  up turning into something good it's like the ring of mordor allegory or parallel but instead
[39:43.480 --> 39:47.680]  they're double crossing us with saudi arabia that's their payoff and now flooding us with
[39:47.680 --> 39:54.120]  the very jihadis from the very group of al qaeda and isis who fly the flag of saudi
[39:54.120 --> 40:00.720]  arabia on black it's just not green it's the very same group admittedly and because we've
[40:00.720 --> 40:06.200]  been made ignorant geopolitically culturally historically the average person still doesn't
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.920]  know what's happening but donald trump does and donald trump has the will to put his life
[40:11.920 --> 40:20.000]  on the line in basically a suicide mission to be demonized to be lied about to be boycotted
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.120]  to be misrepresented he's already lost it's estimated close to a billion dollars the last
[40:25.120 --> 40:31.800]  year major catholic colleges are saying no one's allowed to stay at your hotels and no
[40:31.800 --> 40:35.440]  one's allowed to play golf at your resorts for our college teams i mean it's you know
[40:35.440 --> 40:40.880]  they're canceling is his beauty pageants they're trying to ban his in building in europe they're
[40:40.880 --> 40:47.360]  trying to kick him out of the uk where his mother was born in scotland they are doing
[40:47.360 --> 40:55.200]  everything they can because he's a nationalist period we're already captured they already
[40:55.200 --> 41:00.040]  took us over through fraud that's not rhetoric we are captured now they're mopping up saying
[41:00.040 --> 41:03.760]  you don't have free speech and don't say mother or father and we're going to take your private
[41:03.760 --> 41:07.680]  property and we're going to arrest the amish all over the country for having their own
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.720]  milk i mean it's happening folks they're going after anybody that's not part of the corporate
[41:12.720 --> 41:20.360]  borg here's another analogy the 1984 82 whatever it is remake john carpenter the thing kurt
[41:20.360 --> 41:26.280]  russell a true classic super good sci-fi horror excellent actors one of my favorite
[41:26.280 --> 41:34.920]  sci-fi movies i'm a sci-fi buff here's the allegory alien crashes gets out it's going
[41:34.920 --> 41:43.800]  to take over every organism on the earth super predator dominant species is it going to leave
[41:43.800 --> 41:47.320]  the amish aren't going to resist it when it's taken over is it going to leave them out there
[41:47.320 --> 41:53.080]  no it's going to take over every bug every mouse every person every bacteria every virus
[41:53.080 --> 41:58.120]  it's going to replicate and take over but at least the alien takes over becomes the
[41:58.120 --> 42:04.160]  form that it was on that planet so that it can adapt and survive the globalist are rewriting
[42:04.160 --> 42:09.240]  everything playing god because they're not an alien they are psycho control freaks that
[42:09.240 --> 42:20.080]  want to play god who are trying to overthrow creation and leave ugly twisted stinking messes
[42:20.080 --> 42:27.360]  in its wake and they argue well we're like little two year olds with finger paints and
[42:27.360 --> 42:33.880]  we're going to get better well here's the deal your experiment is running over my free
[42:33.880 --> 42:38.160]  will and my destiny and everybody else's and you didn't ask me about your plans for myself
[42:38.160 --> 42:42.800]  and my family you didn't you didn't announce publicly what you were doing you put it in
[42:42.800 --> 42:47.600]  white papers and you're doing it but you didn't get my consent they go well you don't have
[42:47.600 --> 42:51.760]  free will oh then you don't have free will either oh i get it you have free will but
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.920]  i don't i've got to use all the words you say to not hurt somebody's feelings but you
[42:56.920 --> 43:05.680]  can spray aluminum dioxide and barium salts by the tens of thousands of tons a week that
[43:05.680 --> 43:13.240]  we know of into the atmosphere you have all these rights i have nothing i'm just a machine
[43:13.240 --> 43:17.240]  i'm just a biological computer i don't have any free will that's a mind game from you
[43:17.240 --> 43:22.840]  people so i just roll over turn the television on and let you tell me what reality is that's
[43:22.840 --> 43:28.960]  not happening anymore and so as you see the fact that saudi arabia was heavily involved
[43:28.960 --> 43:33.280]  in nine eleven with our own criminal elements in our government and other governments and
[43:33.280 --> 43:41.320]  now obama has come out and said that he will veto a bill and has warned congress and it
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.120]  will bring down the bushes it will bring down the clinton's it will bring down the whole
[43:46.120 --> 43:52.480]  corrupt national security structure that's been set up since nineteen forty seven and
[43:52.480 --> 43:56.640]  by the way you know who wants it to come down the worst the good people in the fb i the
[43:56.640 --> 44:02.760]  cia defense intelligence the geospatial center and sixty or seventy other major agencies
[44:02.760 --> 44:07.720]  who know what happened it's their business they know there was a stand down i remember
[44:07.720 --> 44:14.160]  when a aid to a top general in two thousand and seven leaked a rumsfeld we ought to find
[44:14.160 --> 44:21.400]  it i forget the headline it was like generals told rumsfeld they needed another nine eleven
[44:21.400 --> 44:27.360]  and it's a whole bunch of generals at the pentagon rumsfeld saying sir before you leave
[44:27.360 --> 44:32.600]  we need another nine eleven maybe it was two thousand six we need one to be able to complete
[44:32.600 --> 44:36.440]  our operations the public just isn't listening isn't going along with these wars because
[44:36.440 --> 44:41.560]  they had been told we were doing nine eleven to take out al qaeda and the and the and of
[44:41.560 --> 44:46.000]  course then they weren't providing them with the actual mission to defeat and they were
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.440]  being double crossed so you hear the generals in the meeting with one bible page thinness
[44:51.440 --> 44:56.640]  of plausible deniability they are openly saying sir we've only had one it got the public to
[44:56.640 --> 45:01.560]  wake up we need another can we have another ought to play that tape i played it many
[45:01.560 --> 45:08.080]  times years ago and they're there begging him for another nine eleven to crush radical
[45:08.080 --> 45:13.400]  islam they didn't get the memo you're not going to crush it this was to stir it up make
[45:13.400 --> 45:22.440]  al qaeda heroes launch the new generation ices and take over the world guys try this i know
[45:22.440 --> 45:25.800]  we should be on nine eleven blogger when we broke the story but i'm that's a site that
[45:25.800 --> 45:33.560]  may have an index i would type in generals told rumsfeld that they need that the public
[45:33.560 --> 45:38.240]  needs a new nine eleven that's the headline there it is former c i and d i operatives
[45:38.240 --> 45:41.920]  warned with another nine eleven attack now that's not it that you guys are clicking news
[45:41.920 --> 45:50.800]  tab which is fine you're you're you're really getting expert at this click web this is old
[45:50.800 --> 45:55.680]  you want to go to old you want to go to web to search it whenever it's more than six months
[45:55.680 --> 46:01.240]  old we have a lot of some new crew we're augmenting the crew and expanding the great crew you'll
[46:01.240 --> 46:05.080]  just see me directing up here on air quite a bit that is not putting them down that is
[46:05.080 --> 46:08.360]  in this social justice warrior status out there not with my crew but with the some of the
[46:08.360 --> 46:12.400]  general public directing people and teaching them is a bad thing that's like dodge balls
[46:12.400 --> 46:16.640]  banned any contact sports are trying to ban they don't want people to actually communicate
[46:16.640 --> 46:20.640]  and then and then a boss talking to someone is a sign of hatred evil the social justice
[46:20.640 --> 46:23.920]  warrior class show they're not like that i just want viewers to know that when i'm telling
[46:23.920 --> 46:27.840]  them no do this do that that is just a total transparency of the first show or someone
[46:27.840 --> 46:32.120]  directs from the cockpit there isn't somebody back there in the back directing i'm doing
[46:32.120 --> 46:39.280]  it so we will find that fact i want to bring that back i want to find that the guy that
[46:39.280 --> 46:44.200]  can always find anything is paul joseph watson fact i want to talk about his article next
[46:44.200 --> 46:49.480]  it's up on drudge report dot com by the way the mainstream media has figured out that
[46:49.480 --> 46:53.880]  roger stone is the most influential person with trump right now he trumps the most influential
[46:53.880 --> 46:57.760]  he makes the main decisions but they figured out that roger stone former head of the campaign
[46:57.760 --> 47:01.480]  is basically the top quarterback they got a couple of quarterbacks in there but there
[47:01.480 --> 47:07.400]  are he he's the one moving them down the field and stones be breaking big news here tomorrow
[47:07.400 --> 47:11.560]  and he sent me a whole bunch of articles today where the media is having connection fits
[47:11.560 --> 47:18.040]  about him and more sin paul a transmission he's probably listening maybe one of you
[47:18.040 --> 47:22.400]  guys can call him because i've i've got that fever going now where i've got to have something
[47:22.400 --> 47:25.600]  and i've got and i've wanted it before and forgot to make a big issue out of it i want
[47:25.600 --> 47:31.760]  that pentagon briefing with the top generals with rumsfeld they're around a round table
[47:31.760 --> 47:37.360]  conference table it's amazing audio and they admitted it was real audio smuggled out where
[47:37.360 --> 47:41.080]  whoever was in their thought you know of the aids that were in their thought wow this pretty
[47:41.080 --> 47:47.320]  important they're saying sir can we please have another 911 pretty big smoking gun and
[47:47.320 --> 47:52.600]  you know that's what i'm getting at here is the saw these want to take their money out
[47:52.600 --> 47:57.440]  of the u.s they want to play all these games it's already out we already know from congressman
[47:57.440 --> 48:03.640]  jones and senator graham and countless others that have read the 28 pages and ran paul and
[48:03.640 --> 48:10.440]  our nsa whistleblowers and fbi whistleblowers the countless ones i've had on that contributed
[48:10.440 --> 48:17.240]  and testified secretly to congress to produce the report they know what's in it a norad stand
[48:17.240 --> 48:24.520]  down on faa stand down six months stand down from california to florida from texas to arizona
[48:24.520 --> 48:29.800]  to minneapolis st paul to oklahoma with hijackers at least three other teams not just the team
[48:29.800 --> 48:35.680]  that was involved in 911 decoy teams i believe the main team was a decoy as well from the
[48:35.680 --> 48:41.040]  others we have the only real air phone calls are about gas and people being gassed and
[48:41.040 --> 48:47.520]  we have them ordering the stand down to the fbi we have the deputy fbi director quitting
[48:47.520 --> 48:56.360]  over to okay there is a may 14 2008 op ed news rumsfeld mind of 911 work why not try
[48:56.360 --> 49:03.320]  it again let's scroll down i don't believe that's it uh because we need the audio and
[49:03.320 --> 49:07.160]  there's video i'm going to find it it doesn't matter our listeners will find it's a great
[49:07.160 --> 49:14.680]  job guys uh there it is rumsfeld on 2006 election the correction for that is an attack yeah see
[49:14.680 --> 49:19.920]  if that's the one that has the actual uh audio in it because i'm going to say it again audio
[49:19.920 --> 49:26.000]  audio audio audio audio audio audio audio audio audio audio devastating devastating
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.680]  devastating and there's some type of subliminal block in the public that i can never have
[49:29.680 --> 49:32.200]  this clip again but we're going to find it i'm not mad at the crew i'm just really fired
[49:32.200 --> 49:36.000]  up right now because see we have a criminal group that's taken over the country that launched
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.520]  terror attacks and is bringing in giant sleeper cells right now to launch more and then when
[49:40.520 --> 49:44.320]  i expose that they're behind it they'll say i'm saying there's not an islamic threat when
[49:44.320 --> 49:49.440]  i'm saying there's traders in our government at the globalist hydro specter level that
[49:49.440 --> 49:53.360]  are running it the hour long audio clip was found as part of a data dump there we have
[49:53.360 --> 49:58.440]  it we found it and it's all over youtube it's everywhere good good so we found the article
[49:58.440 --> 50:04.080]  that has it pull it back up please that's a problem 911 people say get into 911 truth
[50:04.080 --> 50:10.160]  again i go crazy when i do because there's mountains of it it's total smoking gun the
[50:10.160 --> 50:13.760]  hour long audio clip was found as part of a data dump by the pentagon in response to
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.760]  new york times freedom of information act request the hubby can post article reports
[50:17.760 --> 50:21.200]  now let's scroll back up to the top and i'll give folks the actual article headline so
[50:21.200 --> 50:24.640]  people can find it and then go get the clip and the clip's probably been moved or whatever
[50:24.640 --> 50:31.760]  but we'll get it rumsfeld's mind of 911 work why not try it again we're gonna find that
[50:31.760 --> 50:42.240]  audio it's devastating devastating oh by the way don't forget we're listed supported info

[54:20.920 --> 54:26.000]  media said he was insane just making it up it didn't exist even though the families were
[54:26.000 --> 54:33.040]  having press conferences on c-span and then a little bird told me over the weekend that
[54:33.040 --> 54:39.400]  he would be coming out this week big time with it again i tell you it is great to talk
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.720]  to little birds it is really amazing that i have to sit here and keep my mouth shut
[54:44.720 --> 54:48.560]  about all the stuff i know but let me just tell you they've got every dumb down moron
[54:48.560 --> 54:52.880]  group out there calling for trumps death you name it because he wants to bring jobs back
[54:52.880 --> 54:56.760]  and wants them to have a future and he knows vaccines are dangerous one of his kids got
[54:56.760 --> 55:02.400]  hurt by it that's that's not known i'm just gonna shut up right now i just cannot believe
[55:02.400 --> 55:07.200]  that they've done the public down that they almost don't even deserve freedom but you
[55:07.200 --> 55:12.280]  know what their victims they've been induced into it so they need a chance to see the truth
[55:12.280 --> 55:18.520]  and then reject it before judgment let's go ahead and go to donald trump on fox and friends
[55:18.520 --> 55:22.960]  saying release the 28 pages that the media two months ago said didn't exist and of course
[55:22.960 --> 55:27.960]  when i exposed it 14 years ago they said it didn't exist either here it is is the 28 pages
[55:27.960 --> 55:33.040]  that were taken out of the 911 report saudi evidently this references saudi arabia you
[55:33.040 --> 55:37.160]  have a democratic senator now retire senator graham who says it's time for the public to
[55:37.160 --> 55:42.320]  see him does donald trump believe it's time for us to see these 28 pages i do i think
[55:42.320 --> 55:46.200]  we should have seen it a long time ago and you know i think i know what it's gonna say
[55:46.200 --> 55:52.480]  it's gonna be very very profound having to do with saudi arabia and saudi arabia's role
[55:52.480 --> 55:58.320]  on the world trade center and the attack and that's very serious stuff and you know what
[55:58.320 --> 56:04.040]  again i've said it for a long time we attacked iraq and frankly by attacking iraq they were
[56:04.040 --> 56:07.440]  not the ones that knocked down the world trade center now i've been saying that for a long
[56:07.440 --> 56:11.440]  time let's see what the papers say i think they should have been released a long time
[56:11.440 --> 56:16.560]  ago i think they're finally going to be at least in some form released but you know it's
[56:16.560 --> 56:21.240]  sort of nice to know who your friends are and perhaps who your enemies are but you're
[56:21.240 --> 56:26.120]  going to see some very revealing things in those papers and i look forward to reading
[56:26.120 --> 56:29.560]  yeah and and people say well that's not all the story it doesn't matter it will bring
[56:29.560 --> 56:37.200]  the globalist down it will expose false flags in europe it goes on and on i mean it is like
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.320]  a christmas sweater that has that one string that you pull it it pulls it all out that's
[56:41.320 --> 56:47.240]  why they've always been so scared of it now again are we vindicated did i tell you first
[56:47.240 --> 56:51.640]  i'm proudest of the fact that i went through hell to tell the truth and i lost so much
[56:51.640 --> 56:58.760]  but i gained so much thank god i had integrity and i'm not bragging about it it's just that
[56:58.760 --> 57:04.040]  we told you the truth specifically and we were right all along and our whistleblowers
[57:04.040 --> 57:09.200]  who are the real champions and you the listeners i salute you now i'm gonna come back and play

[57:28.040 --> 57:32.760]  stop cheating americans he doesn't know that he's told black americans he wants to absolutely
[57:32.760 --> 57:36.800]  focus on them because they've been particularly screwed over bringing jobs into their communities
[57:36.800 --> 57:42.640]  high paying thirty forty dollar manufacturing jobs but it doesn't matter mtv owned by somener redstone
[57:42.640 --> 57:46.720]  i've talked to folks high level in mtv multiple angles where they were told in the nineties
[57:46.720 --> 57:50.040]  we're getting rid of rock rid of all this stuff we want to bring gangster rap to take
[57:50.040 --> 57:54.640]  over the communities and enslave people and they did it so a guy that weaponized gangster

[59:14.800 --> 59:19.920]  hunting supplies create good jobs in the united states but the industry also contributes to
[59:19.920 --> 59:26.520]  the economy as a whole in fact in twenty fifteen the firearms and ammunition industry was responsible
[59:26.520 --> 59:32.160]  for as much as forty nine billion dollars in total economic activity in the country
[59:32.160 --> 59:38.120]  ironically california is second only to texas in firearm job growth and another anti gun

[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.920]  have done it but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that a k forty sevens belong
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.920]  in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:54.880]  we just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.160]  monday and then only do it every monday we need to do this every day of the week and
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:05.320]  just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way enough
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320]  enough
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.560]  in the spirit of gun control will you disarm your entire security team
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:31.040]  they may feel that it's part of a romanticized culture there's there's a there's an aspect
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.560]  of this a kind of wild west cowboy dirty harry aspect there's also an aspect of the macho
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:42.560]  man and they gotta have a go ahead make my day anybody that wants to disarm me and drop
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.320]  dead a trio of would be burglars picked the wrong albuquerque house to break into police
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:55.120]  say when the three teens pride open the door a brave little girl was waiting for them locked
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:08.880]  and loaded it's harder to use an assault weapon to hit something that is a shotgun okay you
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:21.800]  don't need a r 15 it's harder to aim it's harder to use in fact you don't need 30 rounds
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:29.360]  to protect yourself why shotgun why shotgun vice president biden and i had a meeting with
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:36.080]  a group of technology people and talk about how guns can be made more safe by making
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.960]  them either through fingerprint identification the gun talks to a bracelet or something that
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.520]  you might wear anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless people that want to
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:53.440]  literally create the proven places where more innocence are killed called gun free zones
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.800]  we're going to beat you we're going to vote you out of office or suck in my machine that's
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:02.440]  why you're going to fail in the establishment knows no matter how much propaganda the republic
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.600]  will rise again when you attempt to take our guns guns will be taken no one will be able
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.440]  to be armed we will take all weapons i believe that as americans we have a right arm ourselves
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:18.240]  against criminals but we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:24.120]  the united states military is not out to get us the department of homeland security is apparently
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:30.800]  on a huge ammo buying screen it comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition the
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.400]  second amendment is there so and it was put in there not for hunting and fishing like
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.120]  they like to say because back when they did it if you didn't hunt or fish you didn't eat
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.480]  it was put in there so the citizens would have the ability if their government became
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.160]  oppressive they could defend themselves against oppressive government hitler took the guns
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:57.000]  stalling took the guns maltook the guns that el castro took the guns you go show this took
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.760]  the guns and i'm here to tell you 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:13.880]  i don't want that man to have a gun i wouldn't feel comfortable having an argument with
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:19.960]  him in his home where he had access to his 50 weapons challenge out shown to a boxing

[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.080]  in the gut and that's even in the new york times and it turns out the british government
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:20.320]  did two studies previously that they classified that found the same thing that dr wakefield
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:25.920]  had discovered so there are lawsuits involved his partner in the uk has now had his medical
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.560]  license given back to him robert deniro of course was going to air it at the rebecca

[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:41.960]  center in austin texas and so it's obviously near and dear to us and robert deniro said
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.840]  a high level government official personally threatened him but that everyone should see
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:51.640]  the film so we're going to be talking about what vaccines are really doing this is social
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.640]  control this is social engineering we have the cdc documents they're scared and just
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.760]  like the nine eleven commission and just like the congressional commission is suppressing
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.840]  the twenty eight pages doesn't matter folks that have read it or going public like congressman
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.640]  jones senator graham and others bipartisan and our government stood down with saudi
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:16.400]  arabia with the bushes and bare minimum allowed the attacks to take place the saudi arabian
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:23.080]  ambassador to the united states his family his wife for years was giving money transfers
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.480]  to the hijackers who themselves were decoys but the point is it's all coming down i was
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.160]  just talking to billy corgan who is a super smart guy i'm not being patronized everybody
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.000]  knows he is he doesn't give a lot of interviews because mainstream media is dying he wants
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.800]  to talk about that today they twist everything you do they're a bunch of critic schnapps
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.280]  that hate artists and people that quite frankly are smarter than them and that's what social
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:51.320]  justice warrior crap is it is the elite turning loose on the real intellectuals and artists
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.360]  and liberals real liberals turning loose basically fascists that call themselves liberals to
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:02.440]  attack anyone that gets outside the lines and that's what's been happening we've talked
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.800]  a lot about behind the scenes you've told me amazing stuff that i've talked to top executives
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.880]  that if they confirm talk to other big rock stars they said yeah no that's true but you're
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:14.440]  one of the only people because they go after dave mustain he had courage but notice he
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.720]  hadn't been political in a while i talked to him all the time great guy you still go public
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.120]  even though they when you come on they come after you and hundreds of publications but
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.760]  they're out of bullets they're discredited i mean it's an honor so i'm gonna try to shut
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.480]  up because i get really excited when we hang out because your energy level is really you
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.640]  know good and it resonates with me to talk about the state of the world but you were
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.840]  really during the last five minutes when we were on break crystallizing so much so i don't
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:41.360]  want to repeat what you said i want to give you the floor look organ to break down here
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.760]  in studio in austin texas founder of smashing pumpkins so many other successful bands was
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:52.520]  it 40 million albums sold um you've got smashing pumpkins nexus dot com uh just you know really
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:58.480]  well the last decade exposing global tyranny um or longer you've been doing this for more
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.640]  than two decades where are we currently in your view as a species where is the planet
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:12.360]  why is everybody talking about the fact that they see they see a quickening happening that's
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.000]  a and then b you said look i'm on a mission this is what i want to talk about today so
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.840]  you got the floor great to see you thank you buddy i don't know how to follow that you're
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:27.600]  so kind let's start here um for a while i've been thinking about making a documentary
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.960]  about america and i'm and then it went from an idea that was maybe gonna go with the pumpkins
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.960]  album to now we're talking about trying to find a partner to make it a sort of a series
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.760]  and what's like the new model of television like the eight part you know like the you
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.480]  know there's that's everybody's talking about the making of a murder you know it's like the
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.920]  kind of the new version of tv it's like binge watching eight part you know sort of more
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.680]  looking at that model so that's exciting because that takes it out of the typical 90 minute
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.880]  thing so i traveled across the country and rv writing songs with a buddy of mine who's
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:03.960]  a vet two tours of iraq and another friend of mine is a professional wrestler good friends
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.080]  and went around and interviewed a bunch of people about america and try to have a conversation
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.640]  with people above the political discourse and above the cultural discourse which is very
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.080]  very difficult because the way most people relate these days is it starts with obama
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:23.200]  this or trump that or did you see what so and so said about somebody else getting people
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.680]  to talk about america from the from a heartful point of view their ancestors which you talk
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:33.080]  about a lot you've inspired me along that uh that path to to talk about their feelings
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:37.200]  about what how they view america and whether that the america that they grew up believing
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.000]  in or not believing in is real or was it ever real and what i found it was really fascinating
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.920]  because i talked to people from every type of background that most americans have a very
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:52.880]  shared conception of what america means and the two things that i heard over and over
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.200]  again were opportunity and hard work that's something they learn from their ancestors
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:02.320]  that's our ethos that's our that's that is in the american dna i would argue and so what
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:09.080]  is often classified as a racial component or a class component is uh antithetical to
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:15.240]  the foundation of the country is we came here to build something that was literally an opportunity
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.880]  now when you say that of course there are people you know start with the native americans
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:25.840]  you know who were disenfranchised along the way so that vision of opportunity has continued
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.760]  to grow and now we've reached another critical mass point in our nation's history where
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:35.160]  where is the line of expansion in terms of immigration in terms of tolerance in terms
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:41.480]  of welcoming in terms of welfare sustainability you know what where are the lines so talking
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:48.480]  about that more in this symbolic uh 250 plus year arc of the country so transcending the
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:56.160]  divide and conquer yes jamming absolutely and it's amazing amazing how when you talk
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:00.760]  to and i would encourage anyone to have these discussions with themselves when you talk about
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.320]  what america really means to them there's a lot of love left in people's hearts for
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.720]  this country that surprised me because the general feeling is we're a nation in decline
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.760]  and we're about to go boom you talk to some people and they don't think that they think
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:19.240]  this is just another you know uh you know bump in the road the reason we're in decline
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:25.560]  is the robber barons admit they want a monopoly they want to end prosperity they want to end
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:30.000]  an expanding pie because they want central control and they're scapegoating capitalism
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.920]  for what they're really running crony capitalism right and they talk about the bad things in
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.360]  america's past well yeah but you compare it to other systems we had the most opportunity
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.120]  we were the most rebellious we were the most trailblazing didn't mean it was great but compared
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:49.040]  everything else it was wonderful where you were born into your cast in italy or in japan
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:54.680]  or in china or in germany or wherever you came from uh or brazil you know you had to
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.480]  get here where you could get out of the cast and and and really show who you were i mean
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.440]  let's take music if you weren't from a rich powerful family 200 years ago 300 years ago
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.720]  in europe it didn't matter how good you were you weren't going to get to write music and
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:13.680]  ever have it heard i would still argue that we are that country um it's it's so and this
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.480]  is something you and i talk about i think that you're fantastic uh you know you you
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.960]  often use the analogy of being the bomber over the target you know okay so you're looking
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.960]  down you you see things people don't see from that vantage point and you've you've invested
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:31.440]  a lot in understanding how to read those things uh your military sources your political sources
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.280]  they you know the roger stones they can give you that birds i read just like i can give
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:42.840]  you the birds i read of culture right or inside mtv you name it i mean been there done that
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:48.040]  so and and what i would say is in where we can be helpful i think is when you sit when
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:55.560]  you talk about uh pan national corporations uh you know uh if you're if you're in if you're
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:02.240]  in the tech world right now your your your sandbox is the whole world you're not stopping
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.200]  at somebody's border and this is why even starting five seven years ago you started seeing those
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.480]  tech companies start cutting deals with um communists and fascists and whatever type
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.520]  of governments censoring being willing to do whatever because that's their playing field
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.080]  now those sit there and we can say you know we're gonna democratize the world every i
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.640]  think most people in particular on so that's a bunch of bs this is this is this is capitalism
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:32.200]  and it's raw power best you can you can play it however you want you can see however you
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.280]  want it's it's you know who's gone he's got a bigger gun who's got more honeys at the
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.760]  table that's right the globalists use capitalism when it expands their power but then at the
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.840]  grassroots they want communism just like obama said in argentina he said oh multi nationally
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.240]  we're going to have capitalism locally we're going to have communism i mean when you have
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.080]  the president united states telling people in another country use whatever's political
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:59.520]  system works i mean that was a laughable moment you sent me a couple articles dealing with
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.480]  this how the president obama is quote scared of google well there was an article i think
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.120]  you guys maybe even ran it the other day about a movie producer a gentleman who was a expendables
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:14.120]  three and he basically has come out and said why is the obama government which is a liberal
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:18.360]  government very in bed with hollywood why are they not going after the systems that help
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:23.440]  exploit movies and disenfranchise people who've invested a lot of money to make the movies
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.640]  not not to mention the crews and everything and all the unions about why are they not
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.760]  protecting those people because the tech companies look the other way on the on the illegal downloading
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.360]  of materials we have the technology right now to stop the transfer of illegal music or
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.160]  pirated music and pirated movies they could do that tomorrow why don't they do it they
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:44.040]  put a code in it the device has the code either lesson or not i this is a quick funny story
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:51.080]  i've uploaded my own songs to you know something and it will be deleted because i don't have
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.200]  the right to do it because they have some automatic system that identifies the song
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:58.560]  and takes it down i can't put up my own music now if they have systems in play that shut
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.040]  down my own music and there's not a system there to identify that's my music to use you
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.680]  can they can't stop somebody from i mean yeah some some kid in the dark web can find it
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.560]  but most users are not sophisticated tech users you know they press a button it works
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:15.080]  or it doesn't i said i wouldn't do this but i'm skipping this one network breaks we get
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.040]  more time with billy here today i know that causes them headaches but we're gonna skip
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.040]  this network break right now for some stations out there most stations do end up carrying
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.160]  all because this is a network break billy corgan is our guest we've got the website smashing
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:34.360]  pumpkins nexus dot com thematically though let's let's let's put this out there i mean
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.480]  repeating what you said in the five minutes we talked before we went on air you talked
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.240]  about i said why are you here well like you talk about we want to break the trance how
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:45.440]  do we talk to people that are in the trance you're basically say transcend all the current
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:51.040]  labels and things talk about ancestors talk about larger themes of humanity and destiny
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.320]  let's get into where you think the world is at this current place and where you think
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:01.760]  we're going and and how do we transcend the scientific admitted mind war that the big
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:06.160]  corporations and governments admit they're using perfect okay let's start here when
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.840]  somebody is lying to you they have two choices when you call them out on the lie they either
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.960]  lie more or they admit it and and then you deal with the damage from there so what you've
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:18.080]  done and many other people have done and of course there's you talk to people in entertainment
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.520]  community who are usually pretty awake because they're inside these systems we're at the
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:26.360]  point now we're either the lies going to be triple quadruple double you know whatever
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.920]  are downed on or or it's going to break and we're going to deal with the fallout here
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.280]  and the election has now become the critic the critical mass point catalyst when you
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:43.840]  see the forces at play as you I'll use your term uncloaking I mean brazen brazen robbing
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:52.280]  of people's ability to cast their vote in a in a primary when you see brazen disregard
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:58.280]  of polls when you see AP thing that came out yesterday 6% trust in the media exactly
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:03.560]  let me show that this model in the world would take a 6% approval rating and keep doing the
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:09.040]  same thing that they're doing I mean unbelievable yeah what restaurant would stay open with
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:13.160]  a 6% approval rating right so what does that tell you that says that they're not there
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.840]  to give you the truth they are there as a propaganda arm of a much bigger force is that
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:23.200]  the US government is it some big tech company who knows doesn't matter and they're a facade
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.040]  that's already collapsed they just can't admit it because that would be to admit defeat that's
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.000]  what I'm saying if they the minute they admit the lie it all crumbles so they have to keep
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.160]  just doubling down like a bad gambler who thinks if I can just hit this one bet I'm going to
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.120]  win all my money so what was the term used for went live is it really crystallized you
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.520]  said I mean it was more than it's coming to a head it's peaking or well that look the
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:49.320]  Republican convention is in 90 days and and that is the zeitgeist moment that's the like
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.160]  everybody's got to be there I don't know because listen we live in a digital construct as much
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:58.480]  we you know which is why I think you were so pressing and calling this the info war yes
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.240]  I mean boots on the ground in the in the sorry in the literal sense of how dare you touch
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:07.400]  that microphone slapping around if you want boots on the ground or an abuses electronics
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:14.280]  that's sorry go ahead no no but I eat a look I you know look I believe in political dissent
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:19.000]  when it's focused on real objectives right if you feel like you need to be there to let
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.400]  the world know that you care about something and you want to peacefully be involved in
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.160]  the process I have no problem with that but let's go back to the what I think is the most
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:33.960]  more salient point most people especially listeners this program are conversant in the in the
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:40.600]  themes that you deal with daily the mind control the the propagandizing the the the willingness
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.960]  for governments who are supposed to be our elected represents to literally disregard
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:48.960]  poll after poll after poll that says they want this and that and they've now reached
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.880]  that point where it's a total wall of lies and they're bill is he buying armored vehicles
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:59.520]  and building command bunkers I mean like they know it's all going down so so if you if you're
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:03.240]  on the side of the the fence that we're obviously on which is this is all very transparent to
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:09.720]  us and you accept that probably 25 to 35 percent of the population is either asleep or doesn't
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:15.720]  want to be woken up so what can you say to the people who are awake are engaged and wonder
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.280]  what they can do I think that's the more salient point and I think that's more helpful because
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:25.040]  so I'll start with something that I tell people when I when I talk to I every day I meet with
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.960]  fans before the show and and they often ask me like what can I do you have to stop clicking
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:35.320]  on things you have to you have to you know there's a stop feeding the propaganda medium
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.280]  right okay there's the old saying vote with your feet okay what does that mean vote with
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.040]  your dollars vote with your time yes so when you click on something that you think is free
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:50.120]  it is not free you are in essence disenfranchising your own power by giving somebody else
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:54.960]  power because they want you to click on that stupid thing because it actually means something
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.360]  now that's now that system is the article came out the other day about Buzzfeed kind
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:07.560]  of hitting the wall we're seeing now the fatigue of the clickbait society you know I mean I
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.760]  mean I'm somebody who they make headlines out of the most stupid stuff it's unbelievable
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:14.280]  they literally will troll everything I will say and they make headlines and I say to people
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.880]  at time why do you think they're making headlines they're using me as I wish you tell people
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.960]  because I know you're a really private guy some of the inside baseball you told me because
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.000]  I've talked to so many other big rock stars from the early 90s mid 90s when you all get
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.840]  called in they tell you the new direction you and a few others say hell no and then suddenly
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:34.840]  they won't play you I mean it literally comes down to that level of control with people
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.840]  that won't sell out to the system now that's why I know that George Clooney and all these
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.480]  other people actually know what's going on Leonardo Caprio they get up there and say
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.960]  what they're supposed to or they are black bald I mean the other let's let's let's look
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.440]  at it from a slightly empathetic point of view and I'm not here to say anything about
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.520]  it I'm not bashing them either they're slaves you're not a slave you stood up for it and
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:01.880]  been sick you are one of the few that continue to be successful though despite their support
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:06.680]  but I mean just just the last 20 years on air they just constantly attack you randomly
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:11.680]  for nothing because they're scared of you I don't think it's that I I I I wouldn't go
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:15.280]  to that level because I don't think that people are that sentient and conscious I mean the
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.880]  minions don't know they just know they're green lighted to attack you they're well no
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:24.120]  they're part of a system it's like nobody wants to admit that they're dumb okay nobody
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.600]  wants to admit they're dumb who wants to say yeah I'm dumb okay most people in the media
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.360]  do not see themselves as part of some bigger cabal they they that you know use calm the
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:38.120]  trendies where they like to feel they're part of a cool they're just camp followers they're
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:44.000]  just into this cynical mean attitude right look I had an instance the other day I haven't
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.320]  talked about this yet I was in New York was playing some shows and I looked at the table
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:53.200]  over and there was Michelle Fields the young woman who is the whole thing with Corey Lewandowski
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.600]  in the Trump campaign and she was sitting there with her boyfriend and I recognized her.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.520]  Now it's hard not to stare at somebody when they're in the zeitgeist I mean this woman
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.720]  at that point whatever it was a week ago that was when that whole thing was peaking is Lewandowski
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.240]  going to be indicted when you look at an actual human being you know I'm saying you humanize
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:14.640]  them yes she's not a symbol she's a young woman sitting there you know she is who she
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:19.840]  is I don't know her I don't you know it's not my it's not my moment to judge it's my
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.440]  moment to look and say there's a real person who has a real belief I don't think that's
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:29.360]  somebody who's walking around feeling at least this is my own intuition that they're part
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:35.960]  of something they they some come some master plan I don't think it's that sophisticated
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:41.440]  they like to go with a particular flow sure she's a drama queen they she wants to be successful
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.440]  so he does grab her so she escalates it and goes along with the hype she jumps in the
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:51.960]  river yes the the opportunity exists to be rewarded for something and they don't realize
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.360]  that they're actually sacrificing themselves to the sort of more satanic alter if that
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:00.000]  is you know just to be a bit dramatic about it in essence you don't realize that your
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.880]  participation in a particular way so if you just like clicking yes if you talk to the
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:11.120]  individual okay let's let's let's take the most empathetic point of view this young
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.040]  one woman felt in her heart in her heart's heart that she was assaulted okay let's say
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:23.140]  let's take that as complete truth the minute she crossed into certain territories she becomes
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:27.560]  somebody else's pawn I'm I doubt you could sit her here and she would tell you she's
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:33.140]  a pawn at some point I woke up and realized that I was a pawn and so my natural human
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.800]  instinct was I don't want to be anybody's bitch here I don't want to be a pawn excuse
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.880]  my French I don't want to participate in something that I know will ultimately hurt
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.120]  my children and their children you want to be conscious free will on a robot can you
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.840]  so the point is can you exist truthfully in a system that is set up to disenfranchise
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:56.160]  you and disempower you at every conceivable level so let's take the soccer mom she gets
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.680]  up in the morning she drops the kids off she comes home she puts on her iPad and she's
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:06.440]  clicking through and here's Apple's sorting all her news so she's already one layer in
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.200]  is already under control now does that mom think she's being controlled of course no
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.000]  what she reads is already being given to her by the New York Times or Apple she's already
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.600]  being brought into a world and she doesn't even know it right I have friends who all
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.840]  they do is scroll Apple news okay they have no idea that there's sources like you and
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:30.400]  other people who can give them a different perspective nor are they curious okay and
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.440]  so I love it I get these people in my friends you know they're in my home and they start
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.680]  spouting literal talking points from the Clinton oh I've had them I've had liberal family who
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.320]  aren't liberal you know they're more just kind of modern trendy or whatever over and
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.440]  they see me on my big iPad pro or whatever like oh I've had pro and I'm like looking
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:51.840]  at the New York Times and Apple news and Google news they go you read the New York Times we
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:55.320]  thought you were right went like suddenly I was this intellectual and I went I'll try
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:00.640]  to look at everything this is all sorted to different psychology types I also go to defense
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:06.280]  one and read what the Pentagon's being told and they just go oh like you go different
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.760]  places I literally I literally can tell my friends when they come at me with those talking
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:18.720]  points I'm like oh you read HuffPo yeah exactly or or you're a buzzfeed or you're a Reddit
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.520]  so again taking it back to the street level show them how they're we've got to go to break
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.680]  but go ahead that's perfect place to leave it all right I get what you're saying Billy
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.320]  Corgan's thought a lot about how to get people out of their trance he's talked of millions
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.960]  of fans over the years hundreds of thousands on the ground how do you get people that are
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.000]  already caught in a trance out of it how do you break the trance and that's the question
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.600]  Billy Corgan how do you break the trance of the modern the modern sorcerers that have

[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:20.600]  products fairly regularly i mean i i can say this from my heart highest quality i'm i i've
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.680]  been sort of in the healthy side of living for about 15 years it's very hard to find
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:29.800]  products of this quality on the open market well thank you see i'm and i i'm really proud of
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:34.040]  you because i think that's been one of the best things you've done well thank you i i mean not
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.520]  that i'm mr healthy i i got where i didn't care about myself got depressed about the new world order
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:43.400]  kind of saw myself as expendable gained almost 100 pounds was just falling apart and as i slowly
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:47.240]  got back into health and stuff i was trying to find the best you know vitamins minerals plus
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.760]  i had sponsors that were you know it's very difficult on the open market what's the right
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:56.360]  vitamin you know well here's why they do it with california standards so high that almost nothing's
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.200]  perfectly clean i mean there's more lead in the air as you know than there is in you know in a in a
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:06.360]  tomato that it's hard to so all the time we don't have the product and are sold out because we'll
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:11.480]  get batches of supposed stuff it's not it's contaminated so we have to sit back return it
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.920]  sometimes get the lawyers back and forth so that's why we're sold out half the time so i get why
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:20.760]  companies don't put out perfect stuff because you basically can't the planet so contaminated
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.120]  but again i think that this part of your to use your term operation i think is really really great
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:32.200]  because this is sort of in this subject anyway how do we support people to get themselves
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:38.840]  right mind mind body soul so they can fight this this this you know we all go through this we look
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.760]  sometimes like if you're people like you and i and we can read the bigger sort of zeitgeist stuff
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:48.200]  because we're in it you know it's oppressive you know there are days you wake up and you're just
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.280]  depressed you just want to go outside and have a good time and play catch with somebody you
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.520]  want to sit around and think about how somebody's you know you know what and you every second of
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:01.240]  every day and that's the part is when you get angry you know what i mean and i think this is very
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:04.840]  important when you get angry sometimes you know it's maybe something most flattering thing to do
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.480]  but what you are doing is you are helping break that trend you're saying this is the proper reaction
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:15.240]  to what is happening to me as an individual not as a public personality as an individual as a father
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:19.560]  this is what i'm feeling when i'm looking down the road at what i'm seeing exactly i'm trying to
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:25.240]  respect people and show how i really feel so as i'm upset i'm panicked it feels claustrophobic
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.400]  after i've read a hundred articles where they're just throwing in our face i really
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.880]  blow up because it's real and and and listen i forget there's a lot of mocking behind that
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:38.440]  which kind of set also serves up the social justice warrior so and there's a mocking tone there
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:43.800]  if you think somebody's dumb or uneducated or a bigot or something mocking them is usually not
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:48.840]  the best way to get through to them yeah you're absolutely right well specifically again billy
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:52.440]  corgan's our guest here we were really getting some hardcore issues during the break we're talking
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.240]  about social justice warriors who i fall down to their level because they're so hateful they're
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:02.440]  so dumb down but they are victims brought up by this culture uh i'm not either young people are
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.800]  super awake or they're super dumb down the statistic show lower iqs lower brain activity
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:11.640]  near trance state that's mainstream news we were talking about that but still when they're
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:17.160]  spitting in your face attacking your reporters who are really real liberals like rob doing people
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:21.640]  and these are real liberals who really love everybody really care about everybody really
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:25.720]  care about free speech really care about open elections and there's a little arrogant 20 year
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.680]  old spitting in their faces screaming at them you hate me because i'm a tranny and it's just
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.480]  this made up thing in their head when when we don't hate them uh what do you i mean how do you
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:41.640]  transcend this because i personally just get mad want to punch them in the nose um well there's
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:46.920]  two schools of thought um one is they're gone you know they're malice they're they have the
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:52.120]  little red book in their hand you're not going to get them back it's a cult it's a cult and um the
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:39:02.360]  only thing that's going to adjust their ideological uh fixation is reality i predict um that this
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:07.240]  hashtag generation because look for everyone that's out there spitting their little uh
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.400]  new year's toy in your reporter's face and i've watched those clips and i'm horrified as somebody
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:15.000]  who believes in free speech and as an as an artist because those people are going to be coming for me
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.960]  let's face it it may not be tomorrow but it's soon enough because i said the wrong thing on the wrong
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:24.200]  day because i was tired and then take my x2 that day or whatever you know what i mean it's like to
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:29.160]  live like that to live where every every word is a landmine you know what i'm saying it's not the
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:35.960]  world i want to live in it's not a liberal world yes i grew up a liberal i grew up a liberal so it's
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.400]  it's odd to me liberals i knew were always like talk about whatever you want get it all out in the
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:44.840]  open more freedom hey let's go back to uh and i'm sure you could find this remember it was at
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:51.480]  around 1978 okay skokie heavily jewish community north of the chicago i was there growing up at
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.720]  the time when they when they let the kkk march down the street and what was the big issue it
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:00.520]  was a free speech issue we don't like it they're thumbing in our nose but you know what's better
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.760]  to have in america where you know these idiots get to walk down the street and spout their hate
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.240]  we're better than them that's what it was that's the world i grew up in a liberal
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:15.480]  democratically leaning chicago that was about tolerance and uh free speech not shut it down
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:22.440]  because it's unpleasant and again oh you haven't said this here so it's not again the lack of
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:28.280]  tolerance of ideas and other points of view is the great achilles heel of the social justice
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:33.400]  worry move they do not apply their philosophical bent across the board equally that's their that's
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.840]  that's what exposes them every time and you guys are doing a great job of exposing that
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:42.120]  but most people most people who are not down there at the rally and spinning their twizzler
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:47.000]  and making up stories about you know ghosts that don't exist and there's a lot of fantasy stuff
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.680]  going on there i mean it it really is like it could be a wizard world can they just caught
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:55.480]  basically a gay pastor here in austin whole foods claiming the gay baker put fag on his
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.480]  cake and they have like surveillance video now of the cake being delivered it's not on there
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:04.120]  i mean like now they're even targeting the liberal place if that's a that's a perfect
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:10.920]  jumping off point for what i really want to try to get at okay what do most people do most
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:16.760]  people's relationship like let's take my friend who's a huff poe reader okay he is a he in his
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:23.320]  heart is a classic liberal he cares about everybody he loves music from every race creed and color
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:30.760]  not a racist in his heart okay uh he reads that stuff and he thinks by participating by
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.880]  hashtagging he's on the good team right so the people you've got to get through to is is the
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:40.840]  people who i even don't have the little red book yet who do care about humanity and do care about
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.880]  free speech and you have to get them to understand how their participation in those they're being
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:52.040]  inducted into a cult absolutely and and nobody wants to admit that they're being fooled now i
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.800]  work in professional wrestling t and a impact wrestling on tuesday nights on pop network
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:01.800]  there's my commercial i've seen this this is great thank you so you know what's the old carney term
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:06.600]  they're marks what was the carney idea we're going to stage a fight you know starting the carnival
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.040]  is in the 1900s we're going to stage a fight we're going to get the local yokas to believe
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.360]  that the kid from the sticks is going to fight the big guy and if he can beat him you know and
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.800]  that's how that's how professional wrestling started believing that what you were witnessing
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:23.240]  was real and you suspend disbelief yes well that's what we have we have a world of suspended
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:29.320]  disbelief right i want to play a short clip we can talk over of just a few social justice warriors
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:35.480]  and what's amazing is people will talk to them and go listen i don't even support trump but i
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:40.520]  support free and open elections what about bernie sanders and they just spit in our reporter's face
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:46.600]  and spit on somebody else just because they just want to hate somebody and they literally are like
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:50.360]  a dumb clan guy that just pulls over on some black guy walking home from work and kills them
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:54.840]  because they're black they want to just project something on to you let's let's let's flip the
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:00.360]  script here for a second okay and this is a very i'm going to try to say this in a sort of hypothetical
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:07.320]  star wars holodeck type of way okay if we could transport back to you know a much much more much
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.480]  much more racist i'm not saying america doesn't have a racist spin but so let's let's let's put
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:17.720]  that out there to start with let's go back to a time where racism was accepted it was institutionalized
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:26.200]  okay if you could go back to selma 1932 and the clan member is spitting in some person of color's
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:32.280]  face don't you think that guy thought he was right too yes okay so how is this any different
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.880]  it's not and then you realize america has problems but the media doesn't teach every other country
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:43.800]  had stuff worse usually but but to look to the media to educate us is it we're stuck on cronkite
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:50.200]  and even he was part of the the deal i'm saying we we have to understand we have to be our own
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:54.760]  judge and jury here well george washington wasn't allowed in most of the private clubs or businesses
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.400]  where you had to be given on trade even operate as a landowner so he was going under something
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:05.000]  lesser than quote black slaves the point was is that it was his will to to be on an equal playing
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.440]  field that helped lead that revolution so so it's just all these forms of class and control
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:17.880]  whereas it should be about free open human dialogue and free association look i work in a very
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:24.680]  rapacious and cruel business you know i'm 49 years old and i'm you know i'm 30 plus years in the
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:30.840]  game i mean i'm on the point oh one percent of the survivor list okay it's a brutal business
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:34.440]  it's a brutal business and i'm not asking for and by the way you look at the best i've ever seen
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:38.840]  for a rock star in this 30 years i bless you my god that's you're handsome and no no no no
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:45.080]  but you're healthy man it's true thank you so what i'm trying to say is i personally even though i
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:51.400]  don't like it i personally don't mind a capitalist society that leverages the power based on
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:59.160]  opportunity because i believe in in in any social political uh capitalist system that existed america
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.920]  has provided more freedom for more people for the longest period of time so are there losers in that
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:09.880]  game yes and at some point even i'm a loser in that game but i believe in that system more
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:14.920]  than a system that would be gamed for me i would sell more records i would have more opportunities
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.880]  if i would turn into one of those sure sure i was offered first two million a year like 18 years ago
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:25.160]  and then five million and then even more i mean we're talking over 10 million dollars a year contract
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:28.600]  to have shows bigger than glenbeck's limbaugh now i've been offered at all by the by the big
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:34.440]  center case so what i thought is that that wasn't winning to me to have the biggest house in a private
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:40.360]  jet winning is to see 9 11 truth that i expose now all over the newspapers 15 years later
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:45.240]  to expose the tyrants that did this i mean i really think about myself with everybody else i
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:50.280]  really have empathy and it's not because i'm some loving goody tissues that's a normal human instinct
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:55.160]  of someone that wants to live on a good planet i do most people like we all have extended friends
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.400]  and family and we would probably classify most of those people as good-hearted we probably wouldn't
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:03.240]  have them in our lives and i think that probably goes for anybody listening to us yes okay so
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:09.160]  what it what is happening that is allowing those people to be led down a path gerbil said we give
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.120]  them dumb down propaganda that just gives them an excuse to be confused and lay down and do nothing
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:20.360]  okay so if you're if if you're trying to come at it from a different angle because we see the
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.560]  rise of this social justice worry movement as another propaganda kind of a control arm right
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:30.120]  it's here to control us it's the malice here they come and they'll use kids and they'll you i mean
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:35.720]  they have no shame it's classic turning okay right so what is allowing people who in their own
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.200]  hearts have a differing opinion to be led down this path it's a collectivism it's a it's a peer
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:45.640]  pressure it's shaming it's it's guilting it's it's like gang member stuff they're they're young
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.920]  they're uninformed they take them to the college they put them under pressure they send them to
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:55.480]  ruin again that stuff can exist against a majority who deep down doesn't really truly in their hearts
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:00.360]  believe so liberty lovers have to reach out to young people they have to get involved in the
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.920]  community they have to go be part of the student groups whether it's boy scouts or whatever it is
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:09.880]  we have to reach out we have to go to the colleges we have to volunteer we all have to go and reach
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:13.880]  into these groups and break the centralized control that's coming in is that what you're saying and
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:18.200]  stop clicking the pop culture i think i think there's stuff to be said there but i think for
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.800]  most people that's probably more effort than they can make because you know it's a it's not a great
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:26.280]  economy and stuff like this i think you have to look that look again back to the info or thing
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:32.680]  whether you realized it or not you saw something coming long before other people that the the the
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:37.960]  ultimate sort of collapse here was predicated on a psychological control yeah the things you're
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.360]  still talking about are very real most people are in their community most people feel they are
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.440]  participants in their community on some level even if they're paying taxes they're a participant
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:51.640]  they don't like when the water bill goes up we're all part of that i'm talking about a more
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:58.280]  collectivist concept where you know you have this merging of technology the new robber barons you
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:02.280]  know what i mean and i know some of them personally i hang out with them you know so they're not
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:07.240]  they're not not real to me sure and they go along with the bigger robber barons because the minute
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.960]  they get out of line they get crushed right people don't know the ultra rich are the most controlled
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.400]  so let's let's break it down yeah so that anybody uh walking down the street listening
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.240]  can understand what we're saying at the highest levels of power should we blame power for being
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:28.200]  powerful or should we blame the powerful being powerful most people are not powerful so when
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:32.280]  you talk to them about these things even though they can relate and maybe they even have a personal
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:38.840]  reaction there's not much they can do because it's the borg you know to use the start track word
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:45.080]  it's the borg so if you don't realize you're supporting the borg yet you feel oppressed by
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:50.120]  the borg the next natural question is well how do i not support the borg so that's it how do we
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:55.240]  begin none of us are perfect to pull out of the system yes plant a garden garden go to the local
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:59.080]  swap me sorry i don't you know that's important and i don't mean to diminish what you're saying
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.640]  no no go ahead we're talking about the technocratic part of this equation so how do we engage there
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:10.600]  okay pick your favorite company doesn't matter i'm in these systems right so i have to dance carefully
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:17.480]  around these subjects okay pick your favorite system and follow the money follow the money understand
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:23.800]  how your lack of curiosity or lack of knowledge about who you're in the biggest defense contractor
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:30.200]  how did you get into that say that again i mean a long time ago it just boomed suddenly yeah right
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:36.120]  right you have to look at the systems that you engage in pick your system is it a social media
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:39.960]  system by the way they'll attack you for that but you just volunteered that i'll tell you something
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:43.800]  i've talked about publicly so there's no new information here but it illustrates the point
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:49.640]  i quit twitter about six months ago i had about 300 000 i remember okay twitter called me within
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:55.720]  the week why did you quit twitter i said because you guys treat my participation the same as the
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:01.080]  guy who sits all day and hashtags f you this and f you that and if you know i'm saying my vote and my
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:05.800]  participation in your system is worth more to you than some jerk who just tweets negative
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:11.480]  stuff all day and you know that and the guy said yes we do which is why we're calling you and i said
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:19.000]  so you're basically using my credibility my my social status my celebrity my power whatever
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:26.200]  however you want to quantify it you're using it to build up your ipo right aren't you okay so my so
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.400]  how do we the people that bring real skin to the game demand from the technocracy that we're part of
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.160]  whether we like it or not how do we demand you have to hurt you have to hurt them where it hurts
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:40.520]  it's a numbers game i want to come back then and talk about that because you're absolutely right
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:44.040]  we can't consider and bitch the system that's what i'm saying when we're all part of it
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:49.240]  we are part of well i agree that's key but i believe in bigger key is what you first wanted to get
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:53.960]  into and you have how do you get the general person you talk a lot about it to realize they're
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:59.320]  being manipulated they're in a lower brainwave level near sleep that's mainstream news how do

[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:32.360]  you know this big time of change things we're moving into clearly the future battle spaces they
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:38.360]  call it the pentagon is being shaped right now a critical time so many people that have served
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:44.120]  the establishment are realizing now they were set up they were being set up to be obsolete
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:48.600]  a technocracy is coming in the robot takeover this is the elites on admissions but if we're
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:53.320]  there putting out the narrative that humans have a choice and a destiny and that folks can
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:58.280]  break out of their trance make decisions with their actions that can really change the future
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:04.200]  of this and the pentagon even admits in their own reports like their jade helm report about
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:10.280]  mastering the human domain stopping empowered individuals and new ideas their own admission
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:15.000]  reads like an indictment and of course the military themselves are great people it's so crazy you know
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:21.640]  the most awake people are in the military but then the pentagon's own battle plan is like a treasonous
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:31.720]  letter against humanity let's start here nature bores a vacuum okay so pick your system military
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:39.000]  social control uh the educational systems of control okay they're stepping into into a space
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:45.400]  that's been created by the average americans abdication of their civic and social responsibility
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:54.120]  to help run a society which is um has a reasonable level of control you know i'm saying like i used
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:58.200]  to sit on steps when i was 18 years old with the kids with the the spike tear and they talk about
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:04.680]  anarchy and i'd say that's great but like are you not going to have a toilet you know so if we if
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:10.040]  we accept that the average american vision is you know clean living and social systems and
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:15.720]  that social contracts being broken yes but it but but it's it's being it's being broken
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:21.880]  no you you've made fantastic arguments for for why it's being broken but it it can only happen
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:27.000]  because the average american is letting it happen we don't stand up for ourselves well well let's
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.960]  just say it some people are gone we don't revel in that fact like the establishment but some of
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:37.640]  these people are dangerous zombies so what do you do at the point to use your term and and other
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.920]  people a guest on your show they've been weaponized okay so let's just be like we keep it real simple
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:48.360]  um let's say 20 of the people are awake let's say 20 all right let's say 20 of the people are
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:53.880]  weaponized okay so the fight is over the other 60 percent who thinks because they hashtag about
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:57.960]  somebody else across or thinks because they live in a nice house they're immune from it no you're
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:02.680]  not the future of humanity is being decided right exactly so so because more are getting
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:07.640]  weaponized folks more are waking up but more are weaponizing okay there's a race so you have a see
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:12.600]  you have a series of choices first you'd have to identify the systems that you engage in and
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:18.920]  whether those systems are um zero some games whether they're positive or negative for you and
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:26.680]  your family so take any uh take any uh social media system uh facebook snapchat twitter instagram
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:31.320]  is your participation in those systems actually making your life force on some level now most
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:36.120]  people would laugh at that what does that mean just because i retweet a couple pictures or whatever
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:41.080]  i mean is that is that well if you're supporting things that are ultimately hurting your community
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:46.280]  then that argument can and if you're making your life useless crap on these play i only use twitter
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:51.160]  and facebook to attack them and to expose what they're doing and still i feel guilty drudge says
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.840]  hey you shouldn't even do that only do your own thing and more and more i think he's right
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:58.440]  because they already have algorithms cheating us and stopping us from getting straight out
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:03.400]  i mean twitter's been caught um suppressing and and deleting things they do it all the time
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:07.480]  and stopping you think drudge is right i should just totally disengage there is certainly a movement
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:11.560]  in the technological community that's all going to be what they call over the top network in essence
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:16.520]  you you would rather have you would rather have 300 000 people coming to alex jones every day
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:20.920]  than you having to work in other systems and in de facto supporting those systems now those
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:25.560]  arguments can go either way and i i couldn't i couldn't advise you one way as a friend what is
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:29.560]  better i'm involved in those systems as well so what i would argue for is let's call it a
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:35.160]  conscious a conscientious participation if you are if you are a well that's a good stay there
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:39.880]  we're coming back in 70 seconds conscientious wow that's that's powerful stay with us billy
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:44.120]  corgan's our guest oh his facebook we put his facebook up on screen we're using the enemy system
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:47.720]  what's your facebook again it's huge noise oh yeah it's big we'll put it on
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:55.800]  um jobs related to the manufacturing and sell of guns increased 73 percent since 2008 to a
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:59:02.920]  nationwide total of nearly 290 000 the national shooting sports foundation has revealed these
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:09.960]  are good jobs paying an average of $50 000 in wages and benefits and today every job is important
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:15.080]  the foundation reported not only does the manufacturer and sell of firearms and hunting
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:20.680]  supplies create good jobs in the united states but the industry also contributes to the economy
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:26.920]  as a whole in fact in 2015 the firearms and ammunition industry was responsible for as
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:33.640]  much as 49 billion dollars in total economic activity in the country ironically california
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:40.280]  is second only to texas in firearm job growth and another anti-gun state illinois is also in the top
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:57.960]  10 you can find more reports on info wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:08.360]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:11.480]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:21.880]  there is a billy corgan on his facebook page he says he doesn't know about the smashing
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:28.440]  pumpkins musical band know what it's called no no i'm i'm teasing you uh so uh folks can
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:33.560]  obviously follow that but but i think we should use these the censorship is ratcheting in now
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:37.320]  and we were always there before it got really bad but we're going to complain about it while
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:41.880]  they drowned us while they push our head under the water because they say oh it's our platform
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:46.120]  in fact the media is even cheerleading facebook to hey censor people against trump and things
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:50.520]  you know it's your platform but you advertise it's our little safe space to share our life with
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:54.520]  others if i'm not violating your terms of service well now the terms of service says
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:01:00.120]  you can't disagree with someone billy right so go go back to the idea of part conscientious
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:05.400]  participation is that system that you're engaging in is that is that actually helping to enslave you
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:09.640]  and take you away from the from the from the world and or america that you want to live in
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:13.320]  or is it is it empowering you and then you have to make those decisions i only use facebook and
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:18.520]  twitter to inject that it's the matrix kind of like a warning you know shine or an airplane
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.080]  flying over dropping leaflets over nazi germany does that make sense yes but i'm i i guess what i'm
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:28.680]  coming at is is is you know a soccer mom who's got two kids she's overburdened she loves facebook
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:32.600]  because she gets to look at her sister lian made me turn the break i'm saying is and i'm not i'm
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.080]  not even trying to demonize anybody because because you can take those things 50 different ways
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:41.080]  and most people although they can relate to what they're saying they don't really understand how
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:49.160]  it affects them and or is is is how look it's a numbers game you have 10 of people left any social
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.240]  system right now that would be that would be critical damage against those systems i'm not
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:57.720]  calling like a facebook strike or a twitter strike until they start behaving better we need to use
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:02.840]  our power i'm right look i'm talking about people understanding that they have a lot more leverage
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:08.280]  in the system than they think right okay so is your leverage to leave is your leverage to call
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:13.960]  for a boycott is your leverage to uh band together and try to create your own movements like you do
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:19.720]  using those systems to your benefit not reducing yourself to what you would call the enemy but
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:25.240]  actually rising above and calling for a higher conversation so for example we can get to the
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:31.320]  minutiae the weeds of every so tell facebook you can screw me but use some lubrication i'm not
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:39.800]  participating haha okay now you took me off my i was so i was so go go go back i don't know where
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:47.320]  to go with that um i don't know i mean we have to somehow leverage the the fact that we exist on
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:51.160]  these platforms and not just let them program us right well when you're finding out that they have
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:57.160]  been um subverting people's tweets and hiding conservative voices that are out there sorry
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:03.480]  interrupt you i i remember what i was gonna say look the critical if we're when if we want to kind
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:08.600]  of loop together social media structures the social justice uh warrior movement and all that kind of
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:14.360]  stuff and even the rise of of you know uh let's call it this this other voice in in that sort of
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:18.040]  discourse which is using the sort of the old leftist tactics now on the right side the bright
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:24.280]  parts and uh and and and dr savitch is now risen to a prominence after a long and distinguished
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:29.240]  career okay what to what are what is to me what stitches that all together free speech
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:35.720]  free speech once we lose free speech in this country forget it it won't matter what we think
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:40.040]  on drudge visit he said look they're coming up to free speech next year this is i was listening
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.800]  that day and i think that was probably one of the most important moments in the history of your
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:51.000]  uh broadcasting because that shows you that he sees something you see something and together
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.600]  your what it's like that you know what i call that multiplier one times one equals a hundred
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:01.320]  you and drudge on even the same wavelength even if you guys don't agree about a lot of stuff
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:06.840]  you guys on the same wavelength that's the power that's the force multiplier huge amplification
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:13.000]  right but what is that what is the common stitch there free speech once we give up free speech in
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:18.920]  this country it is over it is over and go you might and that's what the social justice warriors
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:23.640]  in the new left are pushing they're weaponized anti-free speech right well how does i think
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:27.400]  they're weaponized weaponized anti-free speech billy corgan warren's of weaponized
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:33.880]  anti-free speech watch watch the clips i am horrified to see young people who uh are coming
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:40.120]  from a variety of backgrounds and you could argue maybe even feel they have a right and or a true
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:44.440]  story to feel that they're victims in a in a culture or system that doesn't recognize their
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:50.360]  participation as it should those are important and uh relevant discussions that are ongoing
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:54.600]  in america and will probably hope well hopefully they will end one day but they won't end in our
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:58.520]  lifetime stay there and lian's going to pop in on this on the other side follow him on facebook
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:03.480]  nearly 40 volcanoes are currently erupted across the world and scientists warn that the
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:07.240]  current conditions could trigger at least four record-breaking earthquakes the earthquakes that
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:11.720]  just hit recently have left over 270 dead in ecuador and over 42 dead in japan with massive
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:16.360]  evacuations continuing out of fear of aftershocks and scientists say at tokyo university estimate
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:20.280]  there's at least a 70 chance that japan will eventually suffer from another earthquake
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:26.120]  equivalent to the great kanto in 1923 which measured 8.9 and killed over 142 000 people
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:29.560]  and other scientists also fear a full-blown eruption of the yellowstone national park
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:34.840]  volcano which could have up to 2000 times the power of the mount st helens eruption of 1980
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:38.760]  some even speculate that the volcanic winter resulting from a yellowstone eruption could
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:43.640]  devastate america's food supply and could even cool the planet 20 degrees the volcanic ash could
[02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:47.720]  even blanket areas a thousand miles away and there's already signs and eruption could happen
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:51.720]  a few weeks ago a river near the supervolcano started to boil and the volcano itself is
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:57.320]  blasting out even more steam than before for more news visit info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv

[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:59.400]  seeing victories for humanity the government the fda has come out and said take fluoride out of
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:04.840]  the water two years ago they haven't done it yet but it is success billy you've dropped a lot of
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:09.480]  bombshells during the breaks uh recap some of what you've said about my generation your generation
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:13.720]  versus some of the new generations where this battle is that lian macadam jump in here because
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:16.920]  you're going to be interviewing billy for a special report we're going to air in a few weeks
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:23.240]  well again i think when we're talking about most people that we know the people in our
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:29.240]  families our extended families they don't see their participation in this so they just
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:35.720]  feel like they don't even exist well uh one of the one of the most positive aspects of the
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:40.520]  trump campaign is he connected the dots on those people who feel disenfranchised by the system
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:45.400]  they look and i and these are people in my family too uh whether you agree with the political
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:51.880]  ideology they sit there and say look i paid my taxes i've raised my kids you know i've worked
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:57.880]  hard uh why am i being asked to carry some additional burden here like why are we not
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:01.400]  why are we not having this conversation why am i being guilted into something why am i not
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:05.640]  celebrated for working 60 hours a week for 40 years why is and and and you and i've talked
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:11.160]  about in the past the the disintegration of the family vis-a-vis the the media culture the the
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:15.960]  the man is always dumb and made fun of and and uh like even commercials where people get like
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:20.040]  electrocuted i mean what what kind of culture are we in now where it's like it's like funny to
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:23.720]  watch somebody get electrocuted and oh by the way by insurance that was well i'm not bashing
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:28.600]  transsexuals but they have this rue paul thing where she's driving race cars and eating fetuses
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:38.680]  it's just all this celebration against life again what what can the average person do
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:45.320]  to not assist something that they consciously or unconsciously uh are are participating this
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:50.040]  it's actually hurting them so realize i'm hurting you figure out how to not be part of it that's
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:55.240]  the beginning i'm coming out of the trans yes because then you start to see how how you've
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:11:00.440]  been deluded it's it look nobody wants to admit that they've been had let's go back to this to
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:04.120]  the wrestling analogy nobody wants to admit their mark if you go to a wrestling event and you know
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:08.440]  it's not real or you go to a movie and know that they're not actually flying in a spaceship
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:14.440]  next to quanta or whatever you you're part of the game you're you're laughing along clen death
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:20.280]  what's that clen death thank you but a lot of people literally think it's real i guess so
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:26.680]  but wait so so when they watch the political system playing out as it is now they they they
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:31.240]  they think that that's real they don't realize that that's a CGI what's going on in the presidential
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:36.680]  campaign is just as CGI as anything so as the facade drops what's going to happen well the people
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:41.320]  in control are either going to double or triple down on the lie and spend a lot more capital
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:47.000]  and energy to convince you and you and you and they that no no no don't nothing to see here you
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:51.400]  you know use that joke all the time nothing you know droid move along that whole bit okay or
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:58.200]  look once you admit to a lie you know you know what hits the fan and this this thing has been
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:02.360]  puffed up and puffed up to the point where when it goes it's going to get it's going to be very
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:08.360]  messy i agree leon maggot any questions for mr corgan well i just think i mean on that note of
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:14.440]  contributing to certain social systems and things twitter for instance it has the ability to meet a
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:20.200]  lot connect a lot of people and create these movements but we talked earlier about how now
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.160]  it seems sort of the powers that be have figured out how to control those movements or they see
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:29.560]  all the zeitgeist this is happening so they're testing steering it sabotaging right and so twitter
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:33.400]  for instance back in the day could start get a lot of people out for revolutions now they just
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:38.360]  use a hashtag and they're doing their part look imagine you're sitting somewhere in some central
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:43.320]  command system like you are here and you have access to all the analytics and just by pushing
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:49.160]  a button or removing a hashtag you can affect the power to corrupt something to reflect your
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:53.000]  political ideology that's a good point because we can literally start memes and a lot of stuff
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.880]  if we wanted to be deceptive it'd be dangerous right but jack who's the twitter guy can suppress
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:03.560]  the hashtag if he doesn't want your certain movement to get any traction that doesn't
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:09.320]  have to trend in america or wherever that's right okay for those who know and you continue to
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:13.720]  participate in those systems you are basically saying that's okay and we've blown past so many
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:18.840]  stop signs in the last seven to ten years where government spying and all this stuff and people
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:23.560]  just kind of shrug and say well it's not nothing to do with me okay now as the system is doubling
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:27.480]  and tripling down on its systems of control people are going to have to either recognize that
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:30.200]  they're part of a system or they're going to can they're going to want to continue in their
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:36.840]  particular trance we're talking to the people who who intuitively feel uncomfortable with the system
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:41.080]  as it exists they know that it's not going to add up to be the world and the society that they want
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:44.520]  their children to grow up in so we need to organize and say we want to change the system
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:49.880]  i think you need to identify those things that are very simple for people to do that democratize
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:55.800]  the big blocks like google and facebook and twitter and apple and say realize you're feeding us the
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:01.400]  agenda we want just admitting there's an agenda is the beginning of change or like matt drudge said
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:05.400]  get out of these internet ghettos they're trying to corral you and control you well that goes back
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:11.480]  to that question yeah so what do you say um to the soccer dad uh to be a pc here okay now it's a
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:16.760]  soccer dad we've covered everybody a soccer person thank you soccer person purple penguin thank you
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:21.720]  a purple penguin i'm sorry it's a purple penguin at a soccer game okay what do you say to the purple
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:27.080]  penguin who still wants to be on facebook or twitter instagram because they like they like how you use
[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:32.440]  the word i say now i like that power i say it's a green pink one now this week change it you tell
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:38.760]  you tell me the code words green one of your races i don't want to offend anybody i have to love
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:44.280]  everyone now right what do you say to that person who says yes i understand what you're saying alex
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:48.040]  yes i understand what you're saying leon but i still want to participate in the system you've
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:54.040]  got to give them more information so they can make a decision based on their own self-interest
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:15:00.760]  when you talk about big picture stuff not everybody can relate it's too big a picture for them well i
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:04.280]  think they need to realize big picture more freedom for everybody means more freedom and i'm not
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:09.400]  insulting anybody's intelligence no i agree i am not a professional nfl quarterback i can't see what
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:15.880]  paint manning sees on the field in the last play of the super bowl he spent 57 000 hours studying
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:20.040]  film so he can see that that guy's going to break open where you and i wouldn't okay you and i have
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:25.080]  since 57 000 hours examining certain parts of the entertainment or the governmental structure we can
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:29.640]  see things breaking long before anybody else can that's why somebody like roger stone at this point
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.760]  is so informative not only for what his intel on the on the trump inner machinations but how he
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.760]  sees the political system i like about him as he's always told me the truth and it's all come true
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:45.240]  most politicals like lion spin that guy is amazing i mean so i like i sorry i like i like listen to
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:50.040]  somebody like roger stone because he gives me that quarterback read on the field at the actual
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:53.960]  street level of the politics and he actually gives you what the quarterbacks will he sing
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:57.480]  most politicals lie to you about what they're saying that's that's the big so that's why i like this
[02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:02.680]  idea of of of what we discussed behind the scenes we'll wait to reveal that's why i like the idea
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:08.680]  so that we can give people that read on the field at a cultural level so they can see when they click
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:13.800]  i want to do it let's make sure it when they click on so and so rips so and so and they click on that
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:18.360]  they have to understand the actual cost of that and we're going to teach them the read and from a
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:23.880]  professional view what we've learned and show them how they're being that that is true empowerment
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:27.720]  you talk about i've always wanted to analyze the propaganda you're right and like 80 of the
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:32.840]  propaganda is in entertainment i i wrote you that day because you you know you say a lot of things
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:38.120]  in your in your in your in your rants babbling in your babbling uh your green penguin rambling
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:41.880]  you say a lot of things and sometimes you flip past them because it's coming at you so fast you
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:46.120]  know it's like you see the sign you you comment and you move on to the next thing that day that you
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:52.120]  said 80 to 90 percent of the propaganda is it propagandizing is in the media entertainment
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:59.880]  complex that was one of the most dead on things you've ever said that is the route where most people
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:04.200]  live and i'm stating the obvious but no one's talking why do you think the politic game is
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:09.880]  being presented like it's just another reality show beauty pageant why when trump would blow up
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:14.360]  meg and kelly where why would they have him back on the next morning because it's pound for pound
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:18.520]  dollar wow all of the more we're almost out of time i know you and leon are gonna do an interview
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:22.360]  you've been very gracious with your time uh you're playing tonight and all of the country
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:25.960]  folks can find out about the tour that's magic i think it's pretty much unfold out but i i thanks
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:29.720]  for coming and you will be playing houston tomorrow even after their devastation as far as i
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:32.520]  know yeah fans have been asking about houston because of what's going on with the weather the
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:37.880]  flooding is amazing here uh we've got two minutes left leon a couple questions because i'm about
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:41.400]  to do an interview well i think it's just interesting to as you were saying you know
[02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:45.320]  forgive people who are still sort of in this trance look at what they're up against
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.760]  even with everything going on with this with the delegate rigging they're set in front of the
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:54.120]  tv at bars totally normal your vote yeah your vote doesn't count trump's so stupid for not
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:59.000]  understanding how the delegate rigging like they're just selling it that this is it's normal okay look
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:06.840]  look trump is known to most people because he was on a tv show his his the way he talks to
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:13.960]  people is learned from all those oh it's dumbed out on purpose okay he's obviously a smarter
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:18.360]  communicator at the at the business level than he is the way he talks to like when you
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:23.160]  watch his speeches it's like it's all soundbites right so he's understood and he understands
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:28.600]  that patois so that's why the media is presenting those things like oh hey your vote doesn't count
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:33.320]  let's move on right because that is literally the next installment of the reality show right
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:36.440]  it's just another installment of the reality show tune in next to find out whether or not
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:40.040]  your vote does matter yeah you know let me ask you this why are they so scared of trump
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:48.840]  um well i mean the the simplest argument to me is that he he's he is a true outlier
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:54.840]  in the dangerous sense of he won't play by any particular rule but he knows the game
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:00.600]  maybe he doesn't maybe he doesn't maybe he just tapped into the zeitgeist and he doesn't even know
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:05.400]  hey maybe he just tuned into this show once many times we've all that's really what happened
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:09.880]  i'm sorry let's let's let's be real let's be real simple here for the sake of argument
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:15.080]  we all belong to a club a click of friends a team and here comes the newcomer and they say
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:18.280]  we don't know if we want you on your team because you're going to mess up our dynamic
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:21.720]  he messes up their dynamics like we've paid our dues we hijacked and took over the world who
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:28.280]  do you think you are look you can literally watch the machinations of these campaigns and the rnc
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:32.760]  and all that stuff and then there's the democratic version too as they have to keep adjusting their
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:37.320]  game plans and their strategies to account for unforeseen circumstances right all as well
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:41.320]  all is not well in camo that tells you they are not as in control as they like to pretend

[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:27.160]  all right he's with us till five after next hour then David Knight takes over and he's Dr. Andrew
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:32.920]  Wakefield he has the new film out going through film festivals Robert DeNiro chose it for his
[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:38.440]  Tribeca founded event and we've had other film festivals like in Houston in places threatened
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:44.280]  there were also other pressure put obviously on the New York festival and it just shows the control
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:48.360]  going on this happened but but separately I'm not going to go through the whole saga
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:52.920]  Andrew Wakefield and his partner's been exonerated in England they came out and said it was all a
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:58.680]  hoax I have a giant stack of mainstream news articles New York Times you name it government
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:05.160]  studies admitting that autism and mental illness and some of the things that's linked to toxicity
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:10.040]  and the gut and imbalances cancer you name it so we're going to talk about this today I know he
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:15.240]  likes to specifically just get into the facts and his own research study he did but wow they
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:19.560]  tried to just pick him out as the bad guy because he was one of the trailblazers and destroy him but
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:25.240]  it turned out there were British studies before his finding basically the same thing so the fact is
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:30.600]  they want to distract away from autism from one in 30,000 to one in 58 they want to distract from
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:36.760]  this but he joins us to talk about the film vaxed produced right here in Austin some of it
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:41.800]  shot here some of the interviews honored and the fact that their attempt to censor it I think will
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:45.720]  cause what we talked about last hour Billy Corrigan the smashing pumpkins the founder of
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:48.920]  smashing pumpkins the Streisand effect where somebody was showing her house if you don't know
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:53.240]  what it is and she complained about it on the internet and then it became a national news story
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:58.680]  uh they try to cover it up so it explodes Robert De Niro on vax the movie is something that people
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:04.760]  should see close quote I'm not anti-vaccines I want safe vaccines that's basically what Wakefields
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:08.760]  always said doctor great to have you great to be back on the show we've only got five six
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:13.320]  minutes in this segment long segment coming up but what's the big news in front of us I mean
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:18.760]  obviously the coverups imploding the fact that they've got vaccine damage funds they try to
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:23.240]  keep secret what does it mean that they're trying to censor this film we're here Alex I'm 20 years
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:27.560]  into this battle now and it could have all continued the way it was going until one man step forward
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:34.840]  a senior scientist a cdc insider saying I was in charge of a study where we tested a hypothesis
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:40.920]  we found that mmr vaccination was causally associated with autism and we hid the findings we hid it for
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:46.680]  14 years and we have known for 14 years that this vaccine is causally associated with autism
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:51.640]  and we have concealed it we put millions of american children in harm's way and I can live
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:56.680]  with that no longer and he came forward and now the world is that's right we have huge whistleblowers
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:02.040]  we've got merc whistleblowers cdc whistleblowers it was a person abc news years ago that they had
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:06.200]  that meeting in the minutes where the head of the cdc says I won't give this to my grandkids but
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:11.080]  now it's coming out tell folks about the whistleblower the whistleblower tested the hypothesis he
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:16.120]  rounded a study which he designed if you took this if this were a money laundering ring Alex this guy
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:21.960]  would be the accountant he would be the last person that you want to be plea bargaining with the feds
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:27.960]  this is a guy who designed the study did all the analysis had the data and said we hid data
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:32.520]  ultimately we just destroyed data they got a big garbage can into the room and they destroyed the
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:37.160]  data they didn't want anyone to see he thought that would be a crime quite rightly it was a felony
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:42.040]  these are federal documents he kept the documents and they thought they'd been destroyed he bought
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:46.360]  them forward years later and confirmed and no wonder they don't want your film seen because
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:51.320]  he's he's gone to congress he hasn't gotten a lot of attention he's the head guy this came out a few
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:55.720]  years ago almost no attention you try to make a film about it no wonder they want to suppress it
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:28:00.040]  absolutely and now that the film has come out it's kind of caught them off guard they then put huge
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:05.400]  pressure on everybody from deniro right the way across the board to stop people they are saying
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:09.640]  and this is the pharmaceutical industry as well as the government don't get it wrong this is the
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:13.880]  government and the pharmaceutical industry telling us what we can say what we can see what we can
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:19.080]  think and ultimately what we will inject into our children's bodies and our own there is something
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:23.400]  gone horribly wrong with democracy in this country and we've got to seize it back and this film is
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:28.040]  now the opening the door opening on that well you're admirable because every time i have you in here
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:33.480]  you're at the cutting edge of working with families trying to put the truth out you name it lawsuits
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:38.040]  you're just been proven vindicated in spades a true trailblazer i know you don't like that but
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:42.040]  a true hero andrew wakefield and everyone talk about yourself being vindicated it's always
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:46.920]  we have a top whistleblower the head of the program you know hired to cover it up did all the studies
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:51.640]  he's now gone public the media won't cover it you're just still worried about the millions of kids
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:55.640]  getting brain damaged alex it's not about me it's not about me at all i'm just a guy trying to do a
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:59.640]  job and trying to and being prevented so i'm a really just obstinate but i'm not going to go away
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:04.520]  i'm not going to duck for this issue it's far too important it's going to be uh from the estimates
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:10.040]  in the movie one in two children born in 2032 are going to have autism that is absolutely
[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:14.440]  unacceptable so whatever the media say about me whatever the politicians say i mean it doesn't
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:19.160]  matter because i don't matter it is what matters is the future of this country and the future of
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:23.080]  this country is its children folks we're going to break ring come back give this guy the floor

[02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:26.440]  information war it's alex jones the film they don't want you to see my phone rings and it's
[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:32.280]  dr. william thompson you and i don't know each other very well you have a son with autism and
[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:39.080]  i have great shame now there's a whistleblower from the cbc who's going to come out and say that the
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:44.920]  cbc had committed fraud on the mmr study and that they knew that vaccines were actually causing
[02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:52.360]  autism my oldest son ian was walking and running after the vaccine he was no longer able to do that
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:58.920]  so i call a clinic and i said i think my child's had adverse reaction to those shots and then
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:04.600]  came the head bang the constant banging against anything that he could find right now i'm sitting
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:09.720]  in a very pretty position in terms of providing you a lot of information the first thing that thompson
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:15.880]  did was to plot a graph now there's no link between early mmr and autism those two lines
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:20.920]  should trap together and they do track together until they get to 15 months and they separate
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:27.240]  and they continue to separate thereafter and they sliced and diced the data in an effort to get rid
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:35.960]  of that effect the relative risk of receiving an autism diagnosis was astronomical wow the cbc
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:45.800]  had known all along there was this mmr autism risk and cbc's judgment the best public policy is to
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:52.680]  continue vaccination unchanged you who run our health agencies in this country you have an obligation
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:58.120]  to make sure that these studies are complete thorough so that we have all the facts oh my god
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:06.760]  i cannot believe we did what we did um but we did a mission of crucial data destruction of
[02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:15.000]  documents misleading the congress grievous harm to innocent children everything i've been telling
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:21.800]  my patients for the last 10 years it has been based on a lie and a cover-up parents should be able
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:30.520]  to count on federal agencies to tell them the truth in 1978 the prevalence of autism was about
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:37.560]  one in 15 000 children if we assume that things are going to continue as they have we can predict
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:44.760]  that by 2032 80 of the boys born will end up on the autism spectrum half the children 80 percent
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:51.320]  of the boys it's a vast number of children who are being diagnosed with autism every day this
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:59.240]  is going to be a complete catastrophe if we just let it happen facts what are they going to do in
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:04.920]  one in two or one in three in the next decade or so is brain damage what are they going to do the
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:08.680]  cover-up's not going to work and obviously it's a cocktail the pesticides and everything but
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:14.200]  they've they've linked it i've got a stack of new york times you name it to gut flora problems and
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:19.720]  and viral infections and brain damage it's in the new york times now and dr wakefield pioneered
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:24.520]  the research that he learned government had already secretly done he's here to break it down
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:29.880]  autism media channel dot com the film is vaxed uh robert inero under pressure canceled showing
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:33.480]  at rebecca but says everyone should see it government officials have threatened other
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:41.080]  film festivals to shut it down uh all of this is going on and they don't even want folks to know
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:46.360]  there's ways to mitigate it so look here's the deal why are so many democrat republican congress
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:52.760]  people going out saying we should investigate why are there cdp cdc high-level whistleblowers going
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:58.040]  public because it doesn't matter how much propaganda you buy into when you're 18 months old gets that
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:03.720]  third round of shots and boys don't have the blood brain barrier and it's mainly boys 80% or so
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:07.880]  and they don't ever talk again and they got to wear a football helmet for the rest of their life
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:14.760]  basically it'll wake anybody up and that's why this is such a crisis and that's the kids that get
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:19.000]  hurt the worst a lot of kids just get other neurological problems or things that are lesser
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.960]  on the spectrum so much rather shut up dr wakefield give you the floor in this long segment we have
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:29.880]  16 minutes left in this segment and then a couple other segments to break down how historical this
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:34.360]  is because if you're a radio listener i could go over these articles for tv viewers i'm gonna
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:39.560]  go through while he's talking a stack of mainstream news confirming what he said and he just told me
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:44.520]  yes it's made the film get 10 times bigger that they are censoring it but but this is such a
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:48.920]  big deal because is it on purpose is it the dumbest town or can they not admit it so they're
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:53.560]  doubling down i mean what's this really all about dr wakefield and where are we going from here and
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:59.560]  how do people get behind vax and make sure that every person that has has children about to have
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:03.800]  children every grandparent every school teacher everybody that cares about children which should
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:09.640]  be everyone sees this film and sees all the scientists the insiders i mean this this thing
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:16.680]  deserves an oscar you're very kind alex let me first of all break it down this film is about
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:21.240]  m mr an autism that does not mean that other vaccines are safe or other vaccine components
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:27.000]  are not linked to autism this is based upon the information provided to us by the whistleblower
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:33.480]  so it is based exclusively on facts he gave us the analysis plans he gave us the data outputs
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:38.120]  he gave us the meeting notes he gave us the internal correspondence showing that the knowledge
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:44.760]  of this went right to the very top of the cdc it went to julie gerberding herself who then of course
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:51.080]  went on to become head of vaccines at merc so they knew about it they all knew about it this
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:55.720]  was a huge crime so let me now break down the levels of the crime they committed what did
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:02.520]  they do in terms of fraud first of all they changed the analysis plan so in science you set out a
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:06.840]  protocol this is what we'll do this is how we'll analyze the data and we will stick to it
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:12.840]  you do not change that plan when you find an effect that you do not like and that is what
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:18.920]  they did then they decided to omit data and they omitted data specifically on the very high risk
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:25.080]  in african-american children african-american boys in particular and in children who have
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:29.880]  all races children who were developmentally normal to age 12 months exactly the group we've
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:35.800]  been talking about children who develop normally and then lost skills they then decided that they
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:41.720]  had to destroy the documents in order to get rid of that effect get rid of anything that might
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:45.720]  lead back to the fact that they committed let's remember you have all the whistleblowers the
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:50.360]  documents this is all admitted you only focus on what's provable and it's bombshell it's absolutely
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:55.240]  we will only deal with what we can actually prove and the value of thompson as a whistleblower
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:00.840]  is as he says in the movie itself i will not give you anything that cannot be supported by the fact
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:08.440]  so we have the facts it goes way beyond this but we we don't indulge in speculation so then he they
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:13.320]  the destruction of documents thompson realized that this would be a felony that the department
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:18.200]  of justice were after these documents that other people were after these documents in congress
[02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:22.680]  that to destroy them would be a felony and so he kept his records the rest of them thought
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:27.960]  that they had been destroyed then they went forward and they misled the congress about the
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:33.720]  link between vaccines and autism they misled the institute of medicine the iom and the institute
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:39.400]  of medicine issued a report which said m mr vaccine is not causally associated with autism
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:44.520]  and no further funding should be put into investigating this link on the basis of that
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:51.720]  the vaccine court throughout 5 000 cases of children plaintiffs who were in that court
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:58.920]  seeking compensation for damage autism following vaccination so they were denied their their day
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:06.040]  in court this was an obstruction of justice so alex on so many levels this is a disgrace it's a
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:12.120]  crime it goes from being just simple fraud to a felony and these people need to be held accountable
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:18.360]  you're looking at the eyes of the doctors the scientists the whistleblowers they're so alive
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:24.040]  in this film because these are people that believe in the system and when they finally saw the proof
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:30.040]  weren't going to be part of the murder of millions of children's brains just here in the us alone
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:36.280]  tens of millions every year worldwide in this epidemic and these industries like bayer who for
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:42.040]  a decade knew their factor eight was giving millions of people hepatitis a b and c and and hiv and it
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:45.800]  came out and then in those court hearings that they knew and decided to cover it up because
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:50.360]  that would bring down the company but finally it did come out and didn't bring down the company
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:55.080]  but everybody overuses hitler but when you talk about hitler killing millions of jews and other
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:42:00.600]  peoples and attacking russia and killing 20 million russians and all these other incredible crimes
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:03.480]  people never talk about the russians i'm not i'm not even russian i just think about nobody
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:07.880]  who talks about 20 million russians died in world war two my god i mean what they went through
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:13.960]  and and and found 600 000 brits and 400 000 americans and both my grandfathers almost died
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:20.120]  just because they almost died both of them i feel an an anger towards the nazis and then i and then
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:24.360]  i feel this even greater anger currently with these big pharma people just want to cover this
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:28.840]  up you're looking at one vaccine that you know you 20 plus years ago documented was one of the
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:35.720]  worst this triple shot mmr needles bumps rubella but this really is genocide against our babies
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:40.200]  mainly our young men and then i see it in the fluoride studies the vaccine mercury studies
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:44.600]  all of it blacks for whatever reason higher testosterone levels a little bit different
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:50.920]  souped up this physiology on average it's devastating blacks and you don't hear one black leader
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:57.800]  pointing this out your film gets into that as bad as it is for boys you look at the disproportionate
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:03.800]  towards african americans it's so sad it's just epic what you're exposing it's so huge it's like
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:07.800]  the biggest thing i can imagine i know i'm ranting so don't pause or i'll jump in here
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:12.120]  dr wakefield please continue and also give out the general site autism media channel
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:16.920]  dot com the site that everybody needs to visit and retweet and just know they're censoring and
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:23.960]  know they're trying to stop you're going to save children folks vax the movie dot com va xx ed va xx
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:33.800]  ed vax the movie dot com dr wakefield the pioneer vindicated on target continue well alex the
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:37.960]  credit really lies with the parents it was the parents who bought our attention to this and it
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:42.200]  reiterates the fundamental rule of clinical medicine you listen to the patient of the patient's parents
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:46.840]  and no one knows a child like their mother and they will tell you what happened they weren't anti
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:51.560]  vaccine they went to be vaccinated on time and this was the consequence all they are doing
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:55.960]  is reporting i want clean vaccines you make that point i'm sorry it's just no absolutely this is
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:02.040]  not an anti-vaccine movie it is a pro vaccine safety it is about holding these people don't
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:07.480]  give them liability protection don't put hiv in the blood product just don't screw us over yeah and
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:12.120]  you talk about the sort of major crimes against humanity this is so many worse in many ways because
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:18.760]  these people were sworn professionally and morally hypocritical protect these children it wasn't that
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:23.640]  they were your sworn enemies they were actually meant to be on your side and that for me makes it
[02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:28.840]  so much worse because millions of children have been put in harm's way if these data had emerged
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:33.320]  at the time and they said we're really sorry we found an effect we didn't we weren't aware of it but
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:38.120]  now we will do the right thing we will do a bigger better study to confirm whether it's true and in
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:44.280]  the meantime we will delay just delay the mmr vaccination until after three years and then
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:49.400]  we might reduce the risk of this like depended absolutely and they did not do that instead
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:54.440]  they took they took the option of covering it up and putting all of these children at risk had
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:45:01.160]  they done their job at the time the studies would have been done and we would now know where we are
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:06.600]  we do not we are operating from an extraordinary position of ignorance in respect to vaccine safety
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:15.320]  you know i have children i know you i have three children and they're 13 11 and and and eight i know
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:19.400]  i learned immunity is real i know there's a science i know it's 500 years old smallpox
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:25.240]  you know back in england and back in germany they were doing in france there was a benefit
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:31.080]  there was a negative you did a cost-benefit analysis but i just want them to have liability
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:35.400]  like all the other companies i want to i want to make the choice i don't want to be made to do it
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:40.040]  things like tetanus i mean you know i cut my finger off 10 years ago helping people with
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:44.760]  their boat on fire on lake travis and i fell off and you know cut my finger off they reattached it but
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:49.160]  you know i i went ahead and did this you know looked at it tried to get one of the safer companies
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:53.480]  you know did a tetanus shot because i know that's a real issue i understand it's a real technology
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:58.840]  but don't lie to us and tell us there's no negative end and then just give these companies cover
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:04.520]  but it goes beyond that they know the Gardasil shot 10 years ago in studies in texas and around
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:08.840]  the u.s was causing deaths and autoimmune responses they know it doesn't protect against human
[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:14.920]  papillomates says it in the insert there's thousands of strains four to ten depending on the vaccine
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:20.520]  now they're injecting all of latin america with it directly linked to infertility i know you've been
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:25.880]  attacked because you were so professional and had such great credits and were such a they were
[02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:31.640]  scared of you because you're a handsome smart doctor who pioneered things mr you know mr superman
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:34.920]  they came out for you because they knew you were so good so you don't want to speculate but it's
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:40.840]  not speculation they know these vaccines are being used for social control and i just look at
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:45.800]  to say the Gardasil shot and what and all these countries that abandoned i look at a stack of
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:49.800]  articles here we're going to cover the next hour and day of night comes in new study shows mutated
[02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:55.640]  polio virus maybe responsible for paralyzing more than 100 children in the past year daily mail
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:47:01.000]  mpr new polio vaccine rollout comes with a big risk uh the entire world has two weeks to switch
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  over to new polio vaccine here's why they're recalling it i mean there's something else here
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:13.240]  when these companies don't care when they know it's hurting people who are these ceos because
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:17.080]  i'll be honest i'm not an addictive person but you mess with children like pedophiles and stuff
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:22.520]  i got an instinct to want to see you with up there with a rope around your neck dr wakefield
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:26.840]  yes and people keep talking about that when when we get into this issue what about polio what about
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:32.600]  polio what about the benefits of polio vaccine and i'm saying this is not about the vaccine's ability
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:37.400]  to protect this is about safety please this is a completely separate how it's made yeah just
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:44.440]  because it protects apparently that does not make it safe philidomide improved morning sickness
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:49.160]  but it caused the most horrendous millions of babies that have arms and legs absolutely so
[02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:54.200]  let's separate these issues don't say to me what about polio so let's just separate this out in
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:58.120]  it's like it's like statins will make you not have a heart attack but they eat your damn brain
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:04.440]  yeah so we you know let's focus on the issue and this movie is about safety and it's about the lack
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:09.480]  of safety studies and the corruption of safety studies at the cdc and that is the issue we need
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:13.880]  to focus on it is not anti-vaccine and it's been portrayed in the media here there and everywhere
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:17.480]  is anti-vaccine oh it's like when i exposed the saudi rolling 9-11 and the stand down which i had
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:22.760]  from fbi and everybody on the show they go oh you say jihadists don't exist no i say they exist
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:26.120]  they're getting a paycheck from criminal elements and that's all proven in the media now same deal
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:31.080]  they go oh you're just anti-science baloney if i can go get some shot that's proven overall to be
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:36.840]  very safe for my kids not to you know die of some bacteria or something that's you know drug resistant
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:43.160]  i'll do it but don't tell me there's no risk no me and my colleagues and i were very very pro science
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:48.040]  the trouble is the science has been corrupted and now we have a formidable example of the corruption
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:53.240]  of science coming from the body itself responsible for the care of these children responsible for
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:59.000]  protecting them i'm all about air conditioning in my car i'm pro science absolutely so we need
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.240]  to completely rethink this because in the end alex the enemies of public health the enemies of
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:08.760]  vaccination policy so vaccination policy are the cdc themselves and the people who are trite
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:13.240]  public confidence in vaccination policy sure because they lie am i wrong to say that the facade
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:18.280]  is imploding i think it is and i think that it was amazing how one man can turn this whole thing
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:21.720]  around let's talk about robert deniro one of the top actors in the world one of my favorite
[02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:25.240]  you know he got backed off he at least said hey see the film and i understand you know people
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:28.600]  are threatening and stuff but have you talked to him or your crew talked to me i mean we know he's
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:33.240]  come out and said see the film yes i have and i feel extremely sorry for him not only is like
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:38.760]  has his life been plagued by autism in his son but he's now confronted with this huge issue he did
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:43.800]  not make the decision to withdraw the film from trybecker it meant a lot to him personally oh i
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:48.040]  didn't know that the media spotted that he you know the decision was really we're gonna skip this
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:51.720]  break this too important for these kids future to explain to us the whole robert devolve as much as
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:58.200]  you can tell us absolutely not robert devolve the deniro robert deniro two great actors i love it
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:02.520]  and he was getting back to robert deniro and and the whole trybecker deal tell folks that story
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:07.080]  because it's key to understand the censorship yeah it was the film they loved the film he and his
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:12.280]  wife loved the film they wanted it shown it was accepted for the trybecker lineup it was due to
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:18.200]  play and then we were told no the film has been pulled came out of the blue censorship of a major
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:23.160]  film festival you know it when you start censoring in a film festival then that's the thin end of
[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:28.520]  the wedge it then becomes propaganda that film festival is merely an instrument of the sponsors
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:33.800]  and the message they do or don't want to get a very dangerous precedent yeah and i but it emerges
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:39.960]  that jane rosenthal who's his business partner really drove this issue to have the film withdrawn
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:44.120]  and i think they made a huge mistake because once you sense of something then everybody wants to see
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:49.640]  it you do not tell americans you do not tell people what they will see think eat uh inject into their
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:55.080]  bodies or the bodies of their children and once you do that then it opens wide up and so we then had
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:51:00.520]  much more coverage than we would ever have had if so the arrogance backfired it backfired completely
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:04.200]  so we then got picked up by a bunch of film festivals houston being one of those and then
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:11.800]  the mayor's office puts pressure through sponsors on the uh on the uh the the film festivals
[02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:17.720]  organizers to ban that now in texas for heaven's sake censoring a film in the state of texas where
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:23.000]  we value uh that's a whole other story the high level federal official threatens the film festival
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:27.000]  in houston incredible saying we will withdraw sponsorship and encouraging all the sponsors
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:31.960]  of that festival to get in touch with the head of the festival to have funding withdrawn that's
[02:51:31.960 --> 02:51:36.600]  racketeering and that is racketeering and they've got it backfires there's a protest outside the
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:41.640]  mayor's office it will show in texas and now many many more people will come and by the way
[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:45.320]  i'll rent out theaters for a week to show it i mean anything saving kids is important that's
[02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:50.840]  another question how do we get behind vaxed folks are asking how when are they going to get to see
[02:51:50.840 --> 02:51:54.840]  it because i know it goes through a process uh through the film festivals when can our viewers
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:59.960]  see vaxed and show it to others they know it's now opening up in film festivals and film theaters
[02:51:59.960 --> 02:52:05.320]  across the country and soon across the world it opened in new york it's now just played in
[02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:10.360]  in california and santa monica and pasadena we were there it's now opening in arizona it's
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:15.880]  opening up uh again in new york it's opening up in dallas it's opening up in plano it is opening
[02:52:15.880 --> 02:52:22.120]  up across the country so if you want it seen then get in touch with cinema libre through our website
[02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:29.720]  vaxedamovie.com and uh contact us vaxedamovie.com contact and become a sponsor in your area to get
[02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:33.960]  this on and get the movie out and then you call the local papers they cover it and you reach your
[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:40.440]  entire city this is information warfare this is trench warfare against these people so exciting
[02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:46.120]  dr andrew wakefield looking at this though again it goes to the instincts of the establishment
[02:52:46.120 --> 02:52:50.200]  they always try to block things and it blows up in their face reminds me of the the exorcist when
[02:52:50.200 --> 02:52:54.440]  the exorcist came out and i was a kid and uh there were priests outside the movie theater saying
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:59.000]  with with placard saying if you watch this film you will go to hell and there were lines around
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:02.280]  the block and people were saying i don't know what this movie's about but i've got to see it
[02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:06.280]  you know if you start telling people in a free country what they can and can't see
[02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:09.080]  then they're going to go and do it they're going to want it twice as much and that is what's
[02:53:09.080 --> 02:53:13.720]  happening now well then but what are these what is the establishment thinking to get this cancelled
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:18.280]  in new york and try to cancel in texas and then it blows up in their face don't they understand
[02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:24.600]  that i mean the media has a six percent approval rating in a gallup poll now a year ago it was like
[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:29.800]  14 percent don't they understand they are hated for covering things up i think they're more and
[02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:33.560]  more and more they're at the behest of their sponsors largely from the pharmaceutical industry
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:37.560]  who are dictating what they will say when they will say it what their headlines are what their
[02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:42.600]  editorials are and that's a disgrace once you lose democracy once you lose the free media you
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:46.200]  lose democracy well that's what i'm i'm scared of ever being endorsed by the mainstream media
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:50.520]  but they're so arrogant they'll never do it just to destroy me they just don't understand it was
[02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:54.920]  like when i was on pierce morgan about the whole gun issue and he's got private bodyguards doesn't
[02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:59.160]  want me you know me to be able to be armed when i he said no you're on three segments no matter
[02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:03.880]  what you say but then when i brought up your sponsors or prozac and other serotonin reuptake
[02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:09.160]  inhibitors linked to psychotic breaks the insert says it they walked in and said he just attacked
[02:54:09.160 --> 02:54:15.000]  the sponsor get him off i saw them say it he's off and morgan's like really i mean they do not
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:20.360]  want that discussed no it's it's incredible how the sponsors control i used to interview with
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:25.960]  charolax and when she was on cbs one of the most wonderful reporters in the expose fast and furious
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:32.120]  autism is a great patriot wonderful and they would she said five minutes after this interview
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:36.120]  there'll be a call from the top floor saying pull that segment it's never going to play because
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:41.720]  our sponsors will pull their funding if it is and so they control the media you experienced it
[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:48.120]  at first hand a test of five for a minute or two to that was with a great reporter cbs news broke
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:52.680]  so many huge report you were there when she was being censored yeah absolutely she was we'd actually
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:56.920]  do the segment it would go perfectly it was a great interview and then she would say five minutes
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:00.840]  later this is going to get pulled i can predict it and i think that's in the end why she just
[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:08.280]  decided she'd had enough she had to get out of that corporation sponsored excuse for news excuse
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:12.680]  for you it was just pathetic that she could not get these remember what news corps knew in government
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:17.960]  studies that the human bovine growth hormone or whatever was causing cancer and stuff and
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:24.360]  making girls be like eight feet tall you know seven feet tall uh they got shut down and news core
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:28.600]  it came out in the film was like we know it's doing it just don't report it it's like but it's
[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:33.240]  killing us and what are we supposed to do yeah and i think that this is why news outlets like
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:38.520]  yours and others are really growing and growing and growing because people have to turn to uh
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:44.200]  to programs that they can trust and they simply can't trust the mainstream media anymore but look
[02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:48.680]  i don't have all the answers and i'm not perfect but i've got so many friends and family that had
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:55.560]  healthy boys who were at 18 months got the third round of shots and they they're just might they
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:55:59.960]  they have a seizure they don't talk again for a couple years they're beating their heads and walls
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:04.680]  we're about to go to break new five more minutes with you vax themovie.com andrew wakefield but
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:09.320]  i i mean i've done it down i've seen the studies but as a doctor as a guy that trailblaze researching
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:14.120]  this why does it hit boys so much worse i know most medical doctors say girls are tougher than boys
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:19.480]  it's just true not tougher lifting weights but harder gunshot wounds starving you name it women
[02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:25.000]  are tougher bodies i mean is that right i mean why is it nothing girls is bad yeah babies as girls
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.040]  babies have a lower infant mortality rate from infectious disease they're tougher for some reason
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:35.640]  and when it comes to vaccine components like mercury we know that testosterone increases
[02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:41.560]  the susceptibility to mercury toxicity whereas estrogen protects the brain it's far more complex
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:47.560]  than that but there is clearly this sex difference that puts um girls an advantage over boys and if
[02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:52.840]  you look at schools going back to an issue raised earlier about is this just the thin end of the
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:57.960]  wedge is there a more pervasive effect of these vaccines then what happens if you're just shaving
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:02.760]  nine points off a kid's IQ how long will that take to detect and if you look at schools then it's
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:08.600]  boys who are failing and not girls so is this more systematic is this more pervasive throughout
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:13.880]  neuroderminal problems and i think it probably is well just like boys are hit or blacks are hit more
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:20.840]  the more finely tuned hot rod a human is studying males and others that's what it's hitting these
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:26.600]  chemicals these things are attacking you know the more dominant aggressive versions of the species
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:30.920]  the leading edge and then women designed to be able to really go through more toxicity more
[02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:35.800]  adversion they're able to survive but as you point out autism rates and women are exploding as well
[02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:39.320]  we're going to go to break for 70 seconds come back for the final five minutes with
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:43.880]  dr andrew wakefield incredible things happening vaxthemovie.com i've skipped multiple breaks

[02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:53.480]  nearly 40 volcanoes are currently erupting across the world and scientists warned that the
[02:58:53.480 --> 02:58:57.240]  current conditions could trigger at least four record-breaking earthquakes the earthquakes that
[02:58:57.240 --> 02:59:01.720]  just hit recently have left over 270 dead in ecuador and over 42 dead in japan with a mass
[02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:06.440]  evacuation continuing out of fear of aftershocks and scientists say at tokyo university estimate
[02:59:06.440 --> 02:59:10.760]  there's at least a 70% chance that japan will eventually suffer from another earthquake equivalent
[02:59:10.760 --> 02:59:17.000]  to the great kanto in 1923 which measured 8.9 and killed over 142 000 people and other scientists
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:22.040]  also fear a full-blown eruption of the yellowstone national park volcano which could have up to 2000
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:26.760]  times the power of the mount st helens eruption of 1980 some even speculate that the volcanic
[02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:30.600]  winter resulting from a yellowstone eruption could devastate america's food supply and could
[02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:35.720]  even cool the planet 20 degrees the volcanic ash could even blanket areas a thousand miles away
[02:59:35.720 --> 02:59:39.320]  and there's already signs and eruption could happen a few weeks ago a river near the super
[02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:43.800]  volcanoes started to boil and the volcano itself is blasting out even more steam than before for

[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:23.080]  show we got some british steel bringing us in the real british steel is here with us dr andrew
[03:00:23.080 --> 03:00:29.800]  wakefield vaxthemovie.com i'm alex jones your host thank you for joining us now in the last five
[03:00:29.800 --> 03:00:33.640]  minutes we have left i didn't even get into all these articles out of the new york times you name
[03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:38.360]  and admitting researchers find link between gut bacteria and mental health that's what you're you
[03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:44.280]  found all of this coming out how do people see the film how do they get behind it you know i've
[03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:48.920]  talked about you never see you've got all these kids at all trump you never see the youngest son
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:52.280]  i've talked to people that know him very well i've talked to trump as well you know the word is the
[03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:57.400]  son's autistic just like robert inero i mean the system's got a problem if they think one in 50
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:01:02.600]  something is causing a rebellion what happens in a few years when it's one in 20 one in 10 one in
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:08.360]  two i mean the vaccine execs they can't go on forever what what do you do you have no standing
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:12.520]  army no police force you're either affected by autism or you look after someone affected by
[03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:17.160]  autism the economy collapses and mark blacks who makes this exquisitely well in the film
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:22.680]  the what happens to our competitive as a nation competitiveness is an autism's the end of humanity
[03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:27.320]  it could effectively be unless something is done to address it now it drains every resource you have
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:31.160]  and just take a school for example people say this isn't my problem my child doesn't have autism he
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:35.800]  didn't have a reaction to his vaccines but suddenly they find the sports programs being cut or the
[03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:40.280]  special programs being cut for the for the excellent students why because it's all going into
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:46.200]  special education the giant new wings of the special ed just sometimes half the school is
[03:01:46.200 --> 03:01:50.600]  starting to hear teachers telling me time and time again i've been in this job for 50 years
[03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:56.200]  i never saw this now we have special classrooms dedicated to this and as you say special buildings
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:02:01.960]  being created for special needs kids it is extraordinary and yet it seems to be in completely
[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:06.680]  ignored by the powers that be i'm sure it's all accidental i'm sure it's not a silent weapon
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:12.120]  for a quiet war i'm sure it's not eugenics i'm sure it's not a soft kill weapon well regardless
[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:16.680]  folks should learn the facts for themselves from your research m mr is linked to the most problems
[03:02:17.400 --> 03:02:22.200]  it's linked to many and we have no idea quite how many because the vaccine program is now so complex
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:27.000]  with mercury in the flu shots for mercury being given for heaven's sake to pregnant women what
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:31.160]  that's unthinkable they've never done that oh for aluminum to be put in there for formaldehyde
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:36.600]  and antifreeze and so it's so complex it's such a toxic soup that we really have no idea what
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:41.960]  precisely an any one child is causing this problem but we do know that the proximate cause according
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:47.720]  to the parents time and time and time again is an exposure to a vaccine i'll be on vacation i'll
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:52.200]  be at the movies anywhere and you see an autistic child sometimes they'll have two in a family because
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:57.720]  you know it's a genetic procriivity that whatever's in it hits them worse it's always genetic yeah like
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:01.160]  you may smoke two packs of cigarettes and genetically you get lung cancer but the cigarettes
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:06.680]  that do it and they'll go no you know he was it's always he 18 months old third round had a had a
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:11.080]  seizure in the office or in the car or that night never talked again it's always the same story
[03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:16.120]  yeah as polytomy describes in the movie it's very very clear this is what happened the doctors then
[03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:21.480]  admit that it's the vaccines and then suddenly the medical records of that child disappear did you
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:24.840]  i don't know if you saw it we did an interview about six months ago rob do did and david night
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:29.640]  did as well with whistleblower head nurses where they go and they say in the premium area they go
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:33.480]  okay we're ordered to give them vaccines they'll stop breathing and die and they gear up and get
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:38.520]  ready with the respirators and the defibrillators and the kids die and they try to make them live
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:44.040]  and they're like they follow the orders to like start to commence the execution but then they try
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:50.760]  to save them after and i saw this the other day above the uh uh nick you nurse a pediatric intensive
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:55.960]  care unit nurse said exactly this she said i can no longer work in there because we are mandated
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:04:01.560]  to give these premature underweight babies the full vaccine schedule and they go into a
[03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:06.280]  respiratory arrest and i can no longer do this imagine you've got like 50 little babies in there
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:10.760]  and you get the order whether they're six pounds of five pounds three pounds give them a shot they
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:18.840]  die they're dying you're you're trying to resuscitate them and then wow it's it's tragic i mean it's
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:22.840]  sad and do i know whether that is the case where whether scientifically this would stand up to
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:28.120]  scrutiny all i know is those studies should and must be done but they're not being done all i know
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:32.120]  is nick you units all over the world say we get the order to give the shots we try to hold it back

[03:08:17.640 --> 03:08:29.640]  on this tuesday april the 19th does that have any significance to you that has been a very
[03:08:29.640 --> 03:08:35.080]  significant date throughout history we have joining us tonight on the nightly news we have
[03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:40.520]  george washington is going to be coming in here with us live and we're going to talk to him about
[03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:44.920]  some significant events that happened on april 19th we're also going to talk to him about a
[03:08:44.920 --> 03:08:53.640]  a fiery explosion that happened as a new president was taking office in 01 actually a terrorist event
[03:08:53.640 --> 03:08:58.040]  so we're going to talk to him about that now a lot of people are talking about 9 11 we have
[03:08:58.760 --> 03:09:06.840]  it is really blown up now in the common news it was something that just uh i guess about a
[03:09:06.840 --> 03:09:11.160]  month and a half ago when national review was making fun fun of donald trump saying he sounded
[03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:18.200]  like an alex jones caller because he said hey we need to release these 28 pages and it was only
[03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:22.760]  people who were coming on the alex jones show that were really talking about it we had former
[03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:28.440]  senators like bob graham out of florida we had uh it would talk about it occasionally but the
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:34.360]  mainstream media wasn't giving it any attention we had uh congressman walter jones come on many
[03:09:34.360 --> 03:09:40.440]  many times with alex talking about the 28 pages but you know it's just a conspiracy you know it's
[03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:48.360]  a this a secret document and yet now everybody is talking about it except some of our presidential
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:53.720]  candidates are not talking about it hillary's not talking about it ted cruz is not talking about it
[03:09:53.720 --> 03:09:57.640]  and i believe kasek is talking about it i didn't look to see if he'd had anything to say because
[03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:03.960]  you know what quite frankly i don't really know what to make about somebody who is singing and
[03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:09.240]  and hoping that he's going to have an engineered brokered convention where the establishment
[03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:15.720]  is going to hand him the nomination and is beyond contemptible and of course he's mr nice guy mr
[03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:21.720]  rogers really until somebody a reporter gets in his face and persists on asking him why should we
[03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:26.360]  take you seriously you've only won one state and that was your home state he got pretty testy about
[03:10:26.360 --> 03:10:33.640]  that but let's go back to the 28 pages and we've just had some recent confrontations with candidate
[03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:40.360]  clinton and she said to nbc news i'm not going to comment about this they get in her face and
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:45.320]  asked her to talk about the 28 pages to talk about the bill that says that if saudi arabia
[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:50.840]  the government of saudi arabia had something to do with this that they ought to be liable
[03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:57.960]  don't you think that's kind of interesting that a candidate who just last week was pushing the idea
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:04.920]  that gun manufacturers should be liable for the misuse of their product now doesn't think
[03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:11.160]  that we have a right or should know about these 28 pages and probably because she doesn't support
[03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:18.360]  any lawsuits against saudi arabia if they were found to be complicit in this so we have a situation
[03:11:18.360 --> 03:11:25.720]  where if you've got somebody that we were told these 911 uh these missing 28 pages of the 911
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:32.120]  commission document the involvement of the saudi saudi arabian government and there's 911 families
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:38.120]  who say well we want to hold somebody who was engaged in that kind of massive criminal activity
[03:11:38.120 --> 03:11:44.600]  responsible because they were involved in that activity she says no no no no we that that really
[03:11:44.600 --> 03:11:48.920]  doesn't serve our interests brock obama says uh and i'm going to probably veto that because that
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:54.440]  doesn't serve our interests but when it comes to sandy hook if they can go after the gun manufacturers
[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:59.720]  and try to take away our firearms then they will do that that's essentially what they're saying
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:05.560]  when she was asked about the paper she said she asked about reporters if she'd read the classified
[03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:12.520]  pages because as a senator she could she said this i'm not commenting she said i think the
[03:12:12.520 --> 03:12:16.760]  administration should take a hard look at them and determine whether that can be done consistent
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:23.480]  with national security in other words releasing them well you know that's also kind of interesting
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:29.000]  isn't it because here she's deferring to national security as to whether or not keep the saudi
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:36.600]  arabian involvement and 911 secret was she really concerned about national security and she put all
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:41.640]  of her correspondence in the state department on an unsecured private server of course not
[03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:46.120]  but when it comes to protecting saudi arabia now she's very concerned about that and listen
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:52.360]  to the way she finishes uh the interview here she says if there's nothing there then fine nobody
[03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:56.600]  will be held accountable because that's a presumption that nobody's going to be held accountable we're
[03:12:56.600 --> 03:13:01.160]  not going to hold the saudi is accountable for their being involved in 911 because you know
[03:13:01.160 --> 03:13:06.120]  national security but when hillary clinton violates national security she's not going to be held
[03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:13.160]  accountable now we've also had ted crews remain incredibly silent as a matter of fact i saw a
[03:13:13.160 --> 03:13:17.720]  video we didn't have time to put this on there but it was a very long video because you had one
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:26.440]  one individual journalist who was a trying to get into trying to talk to ted crews back at
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:32.840]  c-pack trying to get him to make a comment about the 28 pages and ted crews even though he got in
[03:13:32.840 --> 03:13:36.920]  his face several times and asked him ted crews would pretend that he didn't hear you had talked
[03:13:36.920 --> 03:13:42.040]  to somebody else and he followed the ted crews around the c-pack floor as he's shaking hands
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:48.920]  imposing for selfies with all these people and completely ignores this guy hi how you doing
[03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:53.320]  it's so great to see what is your name talking to everybody what about the 28 pages ted what
[03:13:53.320 --> 03:13:59.720]  about the 28 pages well he hasn't read him and he has no comment about that i think it's very telling
[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:04.760]  i went back and i as i'm looking to see if i could find any comments from ted crews about the 28
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:14.040]  pages i went back and i found this article going back to june of last year rand paul battles the
[03:14:14.040 --> 03:14:21.160]  g.o.p over 911 secrets they say the senator rand paul is on his own again on a major national
[03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:26.840]  security issue he said the kentucky republican has offered an amendment that would declassify 28
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:32.680]  blacked out pages from the post 911 report on the attacks it's an amendment that exactly zero
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:39.960]  zero of his fellow senate republican support that would be ted crews included in that okay
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:45.720]  does not support looking at the 28 pages a year ago and he's changed his position on a lot of things
[03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:50.760]  like the constitution and the bill writes but he hasn't changed his position on this evidently
[03:14:50.760 --> 03:14:56.440]  and he still hasn't bothered to read it now going on the article it says this is back in june of 2015
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:15:02.680]  so today more than a decade after this only a handful of senate lawmakers are interested in pressing
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:09.160]  the issue of looking to see why these 28 pages have not been released of the original 46 senators
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:14.520]  12 remain in the senate just two of those are publicly supportive of declassifying the 28 pages
[03:15:14.520 --> 03:15:20.760]  now they say senators like ted crews didn't respond to questions about the 28 pages they said in this
[03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:28.680]  article among republicans senators among republican senators ran paul flew essentially solo that
[03:15:28.680 --> 03:15:35.400]  month back in june of 2015 as he did these things listen to what he did he opposed the patriot act
[03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:41.000]  ted crews wasn't with him on opposing the patriot act he opposed john brennan's 2013
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:47.640]  nominations head of the cia and just a small group of senators joined paul for a killer drone
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:55.400]  related filibuster okay now neither effort was successful except to draw attention to the
[03:15:55.400 --> 03:16:01.240]  initiatives now how did paul get involved with this well so he only recently came recently
[03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:06.920]  came across the issue that was a year ago of the classified 28 pages he began to look into the matter
[03:16:06.920 --> 03:16:13.560]  after a january press conference by representatives walter jones good man walter jones and again he
[03:16:13.560 --> 03:16:19.720]  is the one who kept coming on alex jones to talk about this and those types of people that national
[03:16:19.720 --> 03:16:28.280]  review the operation mockingbird mouthpiece of the cia has continually lampooned as alex jones callers
[03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:35.800]  walter jones and steven lynch pressed the issue in the house along with former senator bob graham
[03:16:35.800 --> 03:16:40.920]  convinced that declassification was necessary as a measure of government transparency
[03:16:40.920 --> 03:16:47.800]  rand paul read the classified 28 pages in early may of 2015 and within a month
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:52.120]  rand paul championed legislation to make public the content of those pages
[03:16:52.680 --> 03:16:56.440]  they say the odds are against him yeah the odds are against him but the odds are starting to turn
[03:16:56.440 --> 03:17:02.760]  around and i think a key part of it is now we can now believe it because cbs 60 minutes has done a
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:09.560]  report i'm glad they did it okay it's better that they finally covered the cover-up is better late
[03:17:09.560 --> 03:17:13.960]  than never and i'm glad that they finally came around to that but we need to understand where
[03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:19.320]  these people have been on the issues and we need to understand where ted cruz remains on the issue
[03:17:19.320 --> 03:17:25.160]  and where hillary clinton remains on the issue we know that donald trump called for the declassification
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:30.440]  of the 28 pages and was ridiculed as an alex jones caller for doing so by the national review
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:37.480]  and of course bernie sanders admits that he hasn't seen the 28 pages even though it's as a senator
[03:17:37.480 --> 03:17:43.800]  he is allowed to read them unredacted he hasn't bothered to isn't that interesting and he says
[03:17:43.800 --> 03:17:51.960]  he won't look but it should be made public i just don't even know what to say about senators who
[03:17:51.960 --> 03:18:00.440]  won't bother to look at secret redacted reports about 9-11 when it's right there i don't know
[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:05.640]  what to say about sanders hillary and cruz i really don't know what to say about that except
[03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:13.960]  it just beggars belief that these people would be so disinterested in what's really underneath 9-11
[03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:19.720]  not interested at all and i can't understand why they wouldn't be interested in looking at
[03:18:20.520 --> 03:18:26.520]  trade reports that have also been classified and secret and redacted like the trans-pacific and
[03:18:26.520 --> 03:18:31.880]  the trans-atlantic partnerships i can't understand that either of course we had senator sessions who
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:38.440]  did it he tried to educate the senators who were too disinterested too lazy to go down and take a
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:45.560]  look at the massive trade reports he put together a summary for them did a dog and pony show with
[03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:50.520]  slides and uh actually they didn't have slides he had charts that he did in the senate they couldn't
[03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:56.680]  be bothered didn't want to take a look at it and went ahead and passed the trade promotion authority
[03:18:56.680 --> 03:19:00.280]  which says we're not going to amend it we're not going to allow any amendments we're not going to
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:07.160]  allow any debate more than 20 hours no filibusters and of course we're not going to allow any
[03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:13.240]  procedural obstacles to this either once it is presented it will go to a vote within 20 days
[03:19:13.240 --> 03:19:20.680]  they just don't care that is the apathy that we're presented with and as we look at whether or not
[03:19:20.680 --> 03:19:26.440]  there should be compensation and we see clinton coming after sanders we're going to talk about
[03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:32.840]  that tonight we're going to have live coverage of the new york primary as the results are released
[03:19:32.840 --> 03:19:36.920]  we're going to take a look at what's happening there between of course the run tonight is the
[03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:41.800]  the question is going to be how sanders does against clinton and what they were fighting over
[03:19:41.800 --> 03:19:46.440]  this last week and we had a gunfight at the democrat debate and the fight was whether or
[03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:51.080]  not you could sue a company when they don't have it done anything criminal well of course
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:56.760]  hillary clinton says yes and bernie reluctantly begins to agree with her as time goes on stay

[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:20.920]  saudi arabia and potential fallout from releasing the information of the 28 pages i just want to

[03:25:08.680 --> 03:25:15.240]  retail price right now at info wars life dot com brain force i was just talking about the missing
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:21.160]  28 pages many of those who are on the original 911 commission have said there was absolutely no
[03:25:21.160 --> 03:25:25.960]  reason for these pages to be be classified in the first place we need to take this out well
[03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:31.960]  here's the real reason we understand that when saudi arabia comes out and essentially tries to
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:39.800]  blackmail people in the silence saying if you pass a bill to allow people to sue us for 9 11
[03:25:39.800 --> 03:25:48.440]  we will dump 750 billion dollars of t bills this goes back to the power that they wheeled over
[03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:52.920]  the united states but of course put this in perspective that's about well it's not even
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:59.640]  quite as much as we did with the tarp bail out should we bail out the truth we bailed out lying
[03:25:59.640 --> 03:26:06.520]  crooked banks in the financial industry maybe we should bail out the truth even if it's going to
[03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:10.680]  cost us 750 billion dollars that they're going to dump but of course somebody's going to buy those
[03:26:10.680 --> 03:26:19.640]  up it'll just be the loss of saudi arabia but this lays bare the kind of naked blackmail that we
[03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:24.920]  have put ourselves in the position to be subjected to going all the way back to our involvement with
[03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:29.160]  saudi arabia and setting up the petro dollar and we talked about this a couple of weeks ago
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:36.120]  on the nightly news the fact that as britain woods uh two uh they came through and they said well
[03:26:36.120 --> 03:26:41.560]  you know europe and other countries were upset about the fact that we weren't really keeping
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:46.120]  gold behind our dollar that was we're telling everybody our the american dollar was backed
[03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:53.480]  with gold but it was an obvious lie an obvious fraud so they took us off of the gold standard
[03:26:53.480 --> 03:27:00.840]  officially and what they did was they set up the petro dollar whereby saudi arabia would agree
[03:27:00.840 --> 03:27:05.560]  that they would denominate their oil and dollar bills they also agreed that they would take the
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:11.000]  money that they got for their oil sales and buy substantial amounts of t bills with a federal
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:17.080]  reserve our private corporation our private central bank and oh by the way by the way uh you know
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:23.000]  they were going to replace alexander hamilton on the ten dollar bill with a woman yet to be
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:28.360]  designated we've got to find a woman who is significant enough to replace alexander hamilton
[03:27:28.360 --> 03:27:31.400]  but then they said well wait a minute we got he's got a new play on broadway
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:36.360]  hamilton's got to play on broadway we can't take him off especially because you know this doesn't
[03:27:36.360 --> 03:27:41.320]  have any white guys dead white guys have been purged out of the hamilton place so you know he's a
[03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:46.120]  cool guy now let's not take him off the dollar bill you know alexander hamilton is now a person of
[03:27:46.120 --> 03:27:51.720]  color according to broadway so let's leave him on and let's get rid of the slaver andrew jackson
[03:27:51.720 --> 03:27:58.520]  and andrew jackson i believe had been put on the dollar bill simply as a bit of uh mocking by the
[03:27:58.520 --> 03:28:03.800]  federal reserve because andrew jackson was the only one who ever stood up to the central banks
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:08.840]  when their charter came up for renewal you know alexander hamilton was all in favor of the central
[03:28:08.840 --> 03:28:14.440]  banks he was their chief advocate when their charter came up for renewal alexander hamilton said
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:20.360]  not gonna do it not gonna do it so they put his face on the pictures they'd like hey look
[03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:25.080]  we got it after all and by the way it's private too how about how do you like that andrew jackson
[03:28:25.080 --> 03:28:29.640]  you thought you're gonna get us well here's our way to dance in your grave but nobody remembers
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:35.880]  that anymore nobody even knows that andrew jackson stood up to the central bank so it's time to just
[03:28:35.880 --> 03:28:39.880]  get rid of him call him a slaver and take him straight off the twenty dollar bill but going
[03:28:39.880 --> 03:28:45.560]  back to what they're going to do they have been supporting the american dollar making it the world's
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:50.600]  global reserve currency because they denominate oil in it and because they buy massive amounts of
[03:28:50.600 --> 03:28:56.840]  t-bills so that's the way they want to threaten and blackmail us but of course it also verifies
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:29:01.560]  what everybody's been saying that they have involvement in this people who've seen the
[03:29:01.560 --> 03:29:05.160]  documents have said well you know saudi arabia is going to look pretty bad in this and you've got
[03:29:05.160 --> 03:29:11.800]  senators on both sides of the aisle as they say you've got chuckie schumer and john cornan who
[03:29:11.800 --> 03:29:20.520]  typically don't agree on anything saying we need to hold saudi arabia responsible for this if they
[03:29:20.520 --> 03:29:26.040]  were involved in this and have some culpability in it then we ought to have the 9-11 families have
[03:29:26.040 --> 03:29:32.200]  the ability to sue them except you know hillary clinton doesn't think so evidently we've also got
[03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:38.920]  people like ted crews and al franken okay those kinds of people all of them are agreeing yeah
[03:29:38.920 --> 03:29:44.680]  we ought to allow the 9-11 families to sue saudi arabia if they helped do this and that's just the
[03:29:44.680 --> 03:29:51.560]  tip of the iceberg stay with us we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run

[03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:55.160]  released information about gold from the us money reserve call 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to us
[03:32:55.160 --> 03:33:09.640]  money reserve.com i'm michael reagan thank you you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:13.000 --> 03:33:17.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i want to move on to vaccines because there's some huge
[03:33:17.960 --> 03:33:22.760]  information that has just come out in the last day or so there is a new polio vaccine rollout
[03:33:22.760 --> 03:33:29.960]  that is going to come out worldwide and they are going to give two weeks to just to switch this over
[03:33:29.960 --> 03:33:36.520]  and they want to eradicate well not polio but eradicate the vaccine for polio and come up with
[03:33:36.520 --> 03:33:42.920]  a new and improved vaccine and what is behind this i found this to be extremely interesting
[03:33:43.640 --> 03:33:49.080]  i heard this on npr last night and just about drove off the side of the road as i heard these
[03:33:49.080 --> 03:33:54.760]  clips now the npr reporter in introducing this says the world uses nearly two billion doses of polio
[03:33:54.760 --> 03:33:59.720]  vaccine each year they're all stored in little vials at clinics and hospitals across the globe
[03:33:59.720 --> 03:34:05.960]  now every single vial has to be destroyed and switched out with a new one it all has to be
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:15.800]  done in two weeks does that sound odd to you does that sound suspicious to you and they talk about
[03:34:15.800 --> 03:34:20.040]  how they've been training for this for months worldwide healthy workers have been taught how
[03:34:20.040 --> 03:34:24.280]  to destroy the old vaccine or sorry health workers not healthy workers health workers
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:31.960]  have been taught to destroy the old vaccine by boiling it incinerating it even burying it in the
[03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:39.080]  ground why they're desperate to get rid of that this was what just a couple of weeks ago i mean
[03:34:39.080 --> 03:34:44.440]  they're still injecting people with this stuff okay but now we've got to incinerate it boil it
[03:34:44.440 --> 03:34:50.120]  bury it in the ground what's going on with that and they said here's what's being done you go out
[03:34:50.120 --> 03:34:54.920]  to all the independent monitors visit these sites make sure that it's being collected make sure that
[03:34:54.920 --> 03:35:02.200]  it's being destroyed so not only do they have a destruction regime that is incredibly rigorous
[03:35:02.200 --> 03:35:06.760]  okay you're going to burn incinerate it bury it and we're going to have inspectors to come out
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:14.040]  and make sure you did this okay now she says the vaccine used in most countries as she starts to
[03:35:14.040 --> 03:35:20.120]  introduce this um scientist robin nandy she says it contains a live virus now the virus has been
[03:35:20.120 --> 03:35:24.840]  weakened so it doesn't make people sick but then goes oh wait a minute says the scientist well in
[03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:33.960]  very rare instances the live vaccine virus can mutate and can cause polio mm that's different
[03:35:33.960 --> 03:35:39.160]  haven't heard that before i'm driving along it's like what i mean this is like telling us
[03:35:39.160 --> 03:35:44.760]  that uh there's uh the government's been lying to us about 9-11 and of course that's they're
[03:35:44.760 --> 03:35:49.560]  not even getting folks that's just part of rolling out that whole narrative getting people to say
[03:35:49.560 --> 03:35:54.440]  well wait a minute they lied to us and covered up some of the foreign government involvement
[03:35:54.440 --> 03:35:59.560]  of the Saudis and probably the cia because uh you know the Saudi intelligence and prince bandar
[03:35:59.560 --> 03:36:05.000]  have been uh linked at the hip with the cia since we've been doing this petro dollar stuff and
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:08.760]  probably before that but i mean you know they're so intricately linked with each other maybe there's
[03:36:08.760 --> 03:36:12.840]  other stuff that they're lying to us about with 9-11 you know like the fact that you had two planes
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:18.760]  but three buildings fell down one one building fell down wasn't even had with a plane you know and
[03:36:18.760 --> 03:36:23.400]  silver stein says you know pull it down and it looks like a demolition and the reporters on the
[03:36:23.400 --> 03:36:27.640]  scene even the mainstream reporters on scene said well that looks like a building demolition
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:32.520]  and then we have architects and engineers who say meh it wouldn't fall down that way
[03:36:33.080 --> 03:36:38.280]  we haven't seen anything like that happen before and you got pilots who say no you can't fly those
[03:36:38.280 --> 03:36:43.640]  planes at that speed at that altitude the air is too thick wouldn't work okay so you got all
[03:36:43.640 --> 03:36:47.560]  kinds of questions then that start to percolate out as people start to look at this and say you
[03:36:47.560 --> 03:36:52.520]  know that conspiracy theory that the government's been telling people really doesn't seem to add
[03:36:52.520 --> 03:36:55.720]  up and now we're seeing the same thing with the vaccines have been saying well you know
[03:36:56.520 --> 03:37:00.440]  that you can't get sick with a vaccine it's not going to have uh adverse side effects like that
[03:37:00.440 --> 03:37:05.480]  now they're saying well wait a minute no no no actually you can get polio from the vaccines
[03:37:05.480 --> 03:37:11.400]  and they said well last year the world recorded about 100 cases of polio and about 30 of them
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:17.480]  were caused by mutant strains from the old vaccine the new vaccine also has a live virus in it but
[03:37:17.480 --> 03:37:21.720]  it mutates much less often yes it's new and improved don't worry we're not going to have
[03:37:21.720 --> 03:37:27.880]  any mutation with this new and improved stuff ain't going to happen that's my honor okay we've been
[03:37:27.880 --> 03:37:32.040]  giving you this other stuff for decades and telling you it was safe and effective but now
[03:37:32.040 --> 03:37:37.000]  we've got to pull it all off in two weeks and burn it burn the evidence burn the evidence don't
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:42.040]  want anybody taking a look at that vaccine and saying you know why are they why are they in such
[03:37:42.040 --> 03:37:46.520]  a hurry to pull this stuff off what's in this that they don't want us to see what's going on with it
[03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:51.320]  okay so they say well in the long run we think it's going to cause 90 fewer cases but there's
[03:37:51.320 --> 03:37:57.960]  one big catch they say the new vaccine doesn't protect against one type of polio that was eradicated
[03:37:57.960 --> 03:38:02.360]  15 years ago that's why it's so important that all those vials of the old vaccine are completely
[03:38:02.360 --> 03:38:06.840]  destroyed some of the virus could leak into the world and we could have outbreaks of a type of polio
[03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:11.160]  we haven't seen since 1999 and so i'm listening to this and i'm thinking well wait a minute
[03:38:12.120 --> 03:38:19.160]  if they're saying that the vaccine has live polio in it and it can mutate and it can cause polio
[03:38:19.160 --> 03:38:24.760]  or polio like symptoms that's what they used to tell us when they people would say hey look your
[03:38:24.760 --> 03:38:31.160]  vaccines are giving people polio the tens of thousands no no no no that's not polio that's polio
[03:38:31.160 --> 03:38:36.680]  like symptoms that's that's not polio well you know we look at this and they say well
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:41.480]  we eradicated it 15 years ago we've got to destroy all this stuff because we don't want anybody getting
[03:38:41.480 --> 03:38:47.400]  that and i look at it and it's like okay you admit now that the vaccine was mutating and giving
[03:38:47.400 --> 03:38:53.320]  people polio and you've got this strain that you said has been eradicated and yet wouldn't people
[03:38:53.320 --> 03:38:58.600]  be getting polio from that strain over the last 15 years was it truly eradicated i mean that
[03:38:59.560 --> 03:39:04.920]  reasoning there just doesn't make sense to me if you have the possibility that polio vaccine
[03:39:04.920 --> 03:39:09.720]  can mutate and give people polio and one of the strains in it can do that and we say we
[03:39:09.720 --> 03:39:15.400]  got to get rid of it because we don't want that strain to be anywhere at all then i would think
[03:39:15.400 --> 03:39:21.560]  that perhaps maybe that strain could also mutate couldn't it and that strain could also give people
[03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:27.720]  polio couldn't it and maybe that strain was the thing that they want to get rid of but they don't
[03:39:27.720 --> 03:39:30.520]  want anybody to see it they want to incinerate it they want to bury it and they're going to have
[03:39:30.520 --> 03:39:35.720]  inspectors coming around to make sure you do it and then they finish up the report on npr with this
[03:39:35.720 --> 03:39:41.800]  zinger and nandy says it's all worth the risk because if the world is ever going to wipe out
[03:39:41.800 --> 03:39:50.680]  polio we have to first make sure the vaccine isn't causing it yeah that would be a good start wouldn't
[03:39:50.680 --> 03:39:56.120]  it that'd be a good start you know you're looking at safety and efficacy of medical treatments one
[03:39:56.120 --> 03:40:00.600]  of the things you want to make sure is is that you know you're not making things worse with your
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:05.560]  vaccines or with your medical treatment you want to know what the risks are so i started going back
[03:40:05.560 --> 03:40:10.440]  and looking at this and saying yeah you know uh it might it might actually have been causing it so
[03:40:10.440 --> 03:40:17.800]  i find this story found several stories june july of last year here's one of them ibt the
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:23.960]  international business times new polio like virus c105 is causing paralysis in children
[03:40:23.960 --> 03:40:29.720]  across the us with 100 cases in 34 states oh that kind of matches to what they just
[03:40:29.720 --> 03:40:34.200]  confessed to over here in this report now what they're saying is a new strain of polio like
[03:40:34.200 --> 03:40:39.160]  viruses believed to be behind the alarming cases of paralysis reported in children across the us
[03:40:39.160 --> 03:40:44.200]  the virus is called the entero virus c105 belonging to the same polio family of viruses
[03:40:44.200 --> 03:40:50.760]  is could be causing the paralysis could be some other viruses are also in the suspect list known
[03:40:50.760 --> 03:41:01.240]  as acute flaccid myelitis okay like polio leads to muscle weakness or paralysis of arms or legs
[03:41:01.240 --> 03:41:06.840]  and has been seen in 100 cases in 34 states so the kind of word meeting it about a year ago
[03:41:06.840 --> 03:41:13.880]  and then they started this program to create a new polio vaccine and to make sure that when
[03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:18.440]  they were going to be able to roll it out as soon as they could get it they continue for a year
[03:41:18.440 --> 03:41:25.240]  to sell this because it's about the money folks so they continue to sell this vaccine for a year
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:32.600]  as they get stock built up of some new polio vaccines and then they're going to make the
[03:41:32.600 --> 03:41:38.200]  switch in two weeks and get rid of the old stuff get rid of the evidence i find that very amazing
[03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:46.120]  amazing you know when dr wakefield was here and we were looking at all these articles about
[03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:50.280]  whether or not they were going to censor his documentary at the tribe becca film festival
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:54.520]  and as i said when i talked about it i thought it was absolutely reprehensible that the people
[03:41:54.520 --> 03:41:59.720]  who were calling for the censorship according to robert deniro and the person who was with the
[03:41:59.720 --> 03:42:05.560]  tribe becca film festival there on the today show the people who are calling for the censorship
[03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:09.720]  they said for the most part were filmmakers filmmakers said they were going to boycott
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:16.760]  the tribe becca film festival unless they censored the other filmmaker who had made
[03:42:16.760 --> 03:42:23.400]  vaks dr wakefield and i thought you know that is one of the saddest things to see this kind of
[03:42:23.400 --> 03:42:27.720]  censorship the censorship of the left of course we see it in science as well we got the u.s attorney
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:31.880]  general talking about and it's building this is something's been going on for a while they're
[03:42:31.880 --> 03:42:36.280]  still continuing to have meetings saying we're going to prosecute people who are climate change
[03:42:36.280 --> 03:42:40.840]  deniers we're going to come after them with the recoats statutes okay we're going to say they're
[03:42:40.840 --> 03:42:46.920]  racketeers or gangsters or corrupt organizations because they don't believe the science they have
[03:42:46.920 --> 03:42:54.280]  an honest disagreement with it and just what uh billy corgan was saying earlier to alex jones we
[03:42:54.280 --> 03:42:59.240]  can't have a discussion of stuff anymore can we we're going to criminalize dissent you are going
[03:42:59.240 --> 03:43:05.960]  to agree with the official story whether it is 911 or whether it is climate change or whether it
[03:43:05.960 --> 03:43:12.440]  is vaccines if you want to question anything if you're skeptical of anything we are now going to
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:19.560]  censor you perhaps criminally prosecute you with a reco statue we're not going to accept
[03:43:19.560 --> 03:43:24.200]  any open discussion and i'm thinking you know when you're looking especially at science issues
[03:43:24.200 --> 03:43:31.720]  things like climate change as i mentioned before they don't have any understanding whatsoever
[03:43:32.280 --> 03:43:36.760]  of the limits of tolerance when they look at this we've had the founder of the weather channel
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:42.200]  saying when we were looking at thermometers in the days when it was analog and a mercury
[03:43:42.200 --> 03:43:46.760]  thermometer and we were looking at that you have to understand there are certain tolerances in your
[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:52.440]  measurements it's the first thing as an undergraduate science or engineering student you learn is
[03:43:52.440 --> 03:43:58.840]  that there are tolerances on what you measure in the lab and they're taking these tolerances way
[03:43:58.840 --> 03:44:04.360]  way beyond what is reasonable as i said before i think a lot of it has to do with the fact you
[03:44:04.360 --> 03:44:08.280]  get a computer model and you got to print out and it's like oh god has spoken look it's on the
[03:44:08.280 --> 03:44:13.640]  computer's printed this out so shut up everybody bow down or i've got a digital readout down to
[03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:19.240]  five decimal places it's like well you know what maybe you're going to get a completely different
[03:44:19.240 --> 03:44:23.560]  reading if you stand over there on the tarmac in the sun then you are over here in the shade
[03:44:23.560 --> 03:44:28.440]  under the trees on your temperature and so there's a lot of different ways that their temperature
[03:44:28.440 --> 03:44:32.120]  measurements can be affected but the whole world is going to melt down if it's one degree we can't
[03:44:32.120 --> 03:44:37.000]  question their moth their models we can't verify their models because their models are projecting
[03:44:37.880 --> 03:44:43.320]  effects out to many decades what we have seen some projections that they have made and some of the
[03:44:43.320 --> 03:44:48.600]  things they've been doing this for long enough that uh we were told by algor that the polar ice
[03:44:48.600 --> 03:44:54.760]  caps would be gone by now and they're not by a long shot so we can't look at some of their
[03:44:54.760 --> 03:44:58.280]  information we can see that it's wrong but what they want to do is they want to criminalize the scent
[03:44:59.720 --> 03:45:04.440]  and we've got a lot of people who are speaking out we only hear it when it's the actors like
[03:45:04.440 --> 03:45:09.800]  robert deniro who come out and say my son has autism and i believe he got it as a direct result
[03:45:09.800 --> 03:45:16.600]  of a vaccine or we got another actor who came out aiden quinn who came out and said that he believes
[03:45:16.600 --> 03:45:22.040]  the same thing he said uh autism doesn't run in my family my oldest daughter had an extreme reaction
[03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:27.480]  to a vaccination she was a normal child and got autism i believe there's a connection here i think
[03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:32.200]  it needs to be looked at and to his credit robert deniro has said yes you need to see this movie
[03:45:33.160 --> 03:45:38.840]  but he also in that interview he says well i don't know about dr wakefield you know he's a
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:43.720]  a lot of people have questions about this scientist and when you look at dr wakefield and
[03:45:43.720 --> 03:45:47.080]  the daily mail and others were reporting it daily mail put his picture there and said
[03:45:47.080 --> 03:45:53.640]  dr andrew wakefield comma discredited like it was his fourth name what they don't tell you
[03:45:54.360 --> 03:45:58.280]  is about how he was vindicated you know where where do you go to get your name back when
[03:45:58.280 --> 03:46:04.440]  somebody smears your name and lies about you and then they have an investigation and you are
[03:46:05.720 --> 03:46:10.360]  found to be not guilty of their accusations you were found to do the right thing they don't
[03:46:10.360 --> 03:46:15.560]  publicize it do they the bbc did not publicize it and going back to here's gone three years ago
[03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:20.680]  april 14th 2013 with the uk's national media and a feeding frenzy whipped up by the uk's
[03:46:20.680 --> 03:46:24.920]  department of health claiming the current outbreaks of relatively few measles cases are all the fault
[03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:30.440]  of dr wakefield the bbc appears to have slipped up and have confirmed that the main plank of the
[03:46:30.440 --> 03:46:36.120]  general media medical counsel's case against dr wakefield and his two colleagues has bitten the
[03:46:36.120 --> 03:46:40.680]  dust they said that he had only carried out one study and he shouldn't have drawn these conclusions
[03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:45.480]  well they find out now that there were in fact two studies that were carried out okay so why
[03:46:45.480 --> 03:46:53.000]  hasn't the bbc reported this why haven't they gone back and corrected it they have not corrected
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:58.680]  that so this is worse than the situation where somebody screams out on page one accusing you of
[03:46:58.680 --> 03:47:05.080]  some crime and then a couple of days later they print a retraction on the back of the newspaper
[03:47:05.080 --> 03:47:12.280]  page 26 in small print no they're still screaming on page one even though he's been vindicated
[03:47:12.280 --> 03:47:18.120]  and when i look at this and i look at his dedication and the fact that he has stood up
[03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:25.720]  and taken the hits to do it for children to keep children like robert deniro's child
[03:47:26.680 --> 03:47:31.080]  from other children like robert deniro's child from having this happen to them or other children
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:37.640]  uh like adan quinn's daughter you know these people have seen this they have been devastated by this
[03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:42.840]  and they're now speaking out they're not going to be intimidated by the medical community
[03:47:43.880 --> 03:47:46.920]  they're not going to be intimidated by the fact that people are going to call them
[03:47:46.920 --> 03:47:50.920]  wackos and loons they know what they saw and people are comparing notes
[03:47:52.120 --> 03:47:57.240]  with each other and you've got dr wakefield who did this investigation who did the study
[03:47:57.240 --> 03:48:02.840]  and then the bbc came in and made accusations against him and then he was later vindicated
[03:48:02.840 --> 03:48:08.040]  and they never did it and i'm thinking you know that is the definition of a real hero
[03:48:09.160 --> 03:48:12.520]  somebody who will continue to do the right thing who will not be intimidated
[03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:19.880]  who will put his life his reputation on the line to save the lives to save the lives not
[03:48:19.880 --> 03:48:23.880]  only of these kids whose lives are destroyed but it destroys the lives of their parents as well
[03:48:23.880 --> 03:48:31.080]  and as alex jones has talked about it is the perfect way to destroy an entire nation
[03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:35.800]  because it's like having somebody who is severely wounded you bring them back to take
[03:48:35.800 --> 03:48:42.440]  care of them and you can't do anything yourself you're basically constrained to that situation
[03:48:43.400 --> 03:48:48.280]  now i want to and the time that we've got left uh tell you about our special that we've got and
[03:48:48.280 --> 03:48:55.480]  also i've got an interesting uh observation i think about what happened with the trailing of this
[03:48:56.120 --> 03:49:01.720]  warship the donald cook something that i find is interesting that the mainstream media is not
[03:49:01.720 --> 03:49:05.960]  talking about a very interesting connection before i go to that just want to remind you that we have
[03:49:05.960 --> 03:49:14.520]  extended the sale for brain force it is now uh 45 off the retail price 45 off the retail price
[03:49:14.520 --> 03:49:21.080]  25 off of our previous sale price it's the lowest it has ever been unprecedented sale on brain force
[03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:27.080]  i think one of the best supplements we have here uh you can find the reviews at info wars life.com
[03:49:27.080 --> 03:49:30.920]  there are hundreds of five star reviews that you can read for yourself see what people say
[03:49:31.720 --> 03:49:37.880]  it does for them make your decision this is a great time to try it when it is 45 off of the
[03:49:37.880 --> 03:49:45.800]  retail price it's brain force at info wars life.com when i'm looking at all the reports about the
[03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:51.640]  back and forth whether the russians are being aggression aggressive towards us whether they're
[03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:57.400]  trying to start world war three and of course uh some of us i would say that i'm concerned about
[03:49:57.400 --> 03:50:02.200]  the aggressiveness of our government one of the things that i thought was interesting you know
[03:50:02.200 --> 03:50:08.840]  you look at uh charlie combs one of his stories he solved it because it was a dog that didn't bark
[03:50:09.480 --> 03:50:15.080]  and i'm listening to this story about the uss donnell cook and how it was buzzed by this uh
[03:50:15.080 --> 03:50:21.320]  eschew 24 russian jet i thought it was very interesting that nobody talked about the fact
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:27.560]  that this very same ship had exactly the same thing happened to it exactly two years ago wouldn't
[03:50:27.560 --> 03:50:33.080]  you think that that would be an interesting point to talk about if you're going to cover this i think
[03:50:33.080 --> 03:50:39.000]  it is and when we come back i'm going to tell you what happened then and why i think perhaps they
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:44.840]  didn't talk about it and we're also going to talk about how john carrey reacted how the naval commander
[03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:51.160]  reacted how china and russia reacted i think the scariest person in this entire equation is john
[03:50:51.160 --> 03:51:03.160]  carrey stay with us we'll be right back do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain

[03:54:08.360 --> 03:54:11.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david and this last segment i want to talk about what's
[03:54:11.960 --> 03:54:17.800]  going on with the back and forth intimidation of russian planes american ships and also american
[03:54:17.800 --> 03:54:24.040]  planes being intimidated by russian fighter jets who is being provocative here what is going on
[03:54:24.040 --> 03:54:28.760]  and of course there is a there's been a lot of reaction to this one of the things that i thought
[03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:32.760]  was interesting in all of these reports they went back and talked about how there had been
[03:54:33.720 --> 03:54:40.200]  multiple cases of this uh this began about april uh 15th about about a week or so ago
[03:54:40.760 --> 03:54:46.200]  there was the uss donnell cook and an encounter with a couple of russian jets but nobody talked
[03:54:46.200 --> 03:54:53.560]  about even though they talked about a similar situation about a year ago with the same class of
[03:54:53.560 --> 03:54:58.680]  ship nobody talked about the fact that it happened exactly two years ago to the exact same ship the
[03:54:58.680 --> 03:55:04.680]  uss donnell cook now first i want to talk about the reactions you got john carrey coming out saying
[03:55:04.680 --> 03:55:11.880]  we could have opened fire on these jets we could have started a war essentially he says it's unprofessional
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:16.520]  and under the rules of engagement john carrey said that plane could have been shot down so
[03:55:16.520 --> 03:55:19.800]  people need to understand this is serious business in the united states is not going to be intimidated
[03:55:19.800 --> 03:55:27.320]  in the high seas okay well fine okay china crows about it says russia humiliated america with this
[03:55:27.320 --> 03:55:34.680]  because you know china is trying to intrude itself into the south china sea into an area that they
[03:55:34.680 --> 03:55:40.440]  do not have any reasonable jurisdiction over they're trying to take over those islands and so
[03:55:40.440 --> 03:55:44.520]  there is a back and forth intimidation going on between the chinese and the american military there
[03:55:44.520 --> 03:55:48.760]  to say we're going to keep this in an international area and that's legitimate but when i look at the
[03:55:48.760 --> 03:55:56.520]  situation with russia uh oh first let me talk also about the response of the naval commander there
[03:55:56.520 --> 03:56:02.920]  okay and he said this is why the navy didn't shoot down russian jets and this is from the navy time
[03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:08.440]  so say russian pilots rattle nerves across a board the destroyer destroyer donnell cook buzzing
[03:56:08.440 --> 03:56:12.680]  within yards of the ship in the Baltic sea provocative sure but they weren't a credible threat
[03:56:13.400 --> 03:56:19.080]  they said unarmed su 24 fighters flew within a thousand feet of the ship once coming as close
[03:56:19.080 --> 03:56:26.440]  as 30 feet in what u.s officials called simulated attacks well the captain rick hoffman said well
[03:56:26.440 --> 03:56:31.160]  we're not at war with russia it'd be one thing to be operating and have a threatening attack
[03:56:31.160 --> 03:56:36.280]  profile from someone who we might not recognize but that's not the case here he says if you got
[03:56:36.280 --> 03:56:39.800]  visual identification of the jet you can see it isn't carrying weapons you don't detect any
[03:56:39.800 --> 03:56:44.120]  electronic emission suggesting there's a missile lock on the ship there's nothing to be done
[03:56:44.760 --> 03:56:49.880]  you don't get to kill people because they're being annoying said the captain of the ship
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:57.640]  thank you we have somebody who is rational okay not the political guys and of course the russians
[03:56:57.640 --> 03:57:02.680]  are kind of blowing it off and say hey there's nothing to this no big deal but you got the chinese
[03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:06.760]  screaming about it you got john carrey saying we could have shot him down and we'd been justified
[03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:14.760]  to do it and fortunately the guy who really is in charge of the ship is a lot more levelheaded
[03:57:14.760 --> 03:57:20.920]  aren't you glad to know that we have some people in the military who aren't these histrionic
[03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:27.080]  war mongering you know bullying people like john carrey shooting their mouth off fortunately
[03:57:27.080 --> 03:57:32.840]  they're not shooting their guns off in the navy they said it would be real interesting to see how
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:37.640]  this is played in the russian papers to see how they play this well the interesting thing is is
[03:57:37.640 --> 03:57:44.280]  that when it came out two years ago the russians were saying that they had flown for 90 minutes
[03:57:44.280 --> 03:57:53.000]  making multiple passes at the same ship the uss donnell cook now this most recent episode happened
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:59.640]  in the baltic sea the previous incident happened in the black sea which is about a quarter of the size
[03:57:59.640 --> 03:58:04.520]  of the gulf of mexico furthermore they were off the coast of romania the time that it happens
[03:58:04.520 --> 03:58:10.920]  which means that they were also off the coast of the Crimea which the russians have had as part of
[03:58:10.920 --> 03:58:17.640]  russia longer than the united states has been the united states and what they claimed at that point
[03:58:17.640 --> 03:58:21.960]  which nobody has talked about and this may be why they're not going back to that two-year anniversary
[03:58:21.960 --> 03:58:27.560]  mark they claim that for 90 minutes they were able to shut down the avionics on this state of the
[03:58:27.560 --> 03:58:33.800]  art 1.6 billion dollar destroyer we'll talk about that more tonight on the nightly news at seven
