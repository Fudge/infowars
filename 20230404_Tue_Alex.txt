[00:00.000 --> 00:29.280]  It's Tuesday, April 4th, 2023. Trump indictment hour. Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:29.280 --> 00:38.360]  This is election meddling. This is the country falling into a banana boat republic. This
[00:38.360 --> 00:47.700]  is the deep state openly flexing its muscles and letting us know that we can't vote for
[00:47.700 --> 00:58.800]  who we want to and that the corrupt blue cities and states are establishing a absolute tyranny
[00:58.800 --> 01:09.440]  over us. And the main target, ladies and gentlemen, is our children. And so we'll be focused a
[01:09.440 --> 01:14.560]  lot today here with Judge Andrew Napolitano, Roger Stone, and many other experts joining
[01:14.560 --> 01:20.760]  us. But the big picture is this. The Tabestock Institute on record created in the 60s the
[01:20.760 --> 01:31.400]  trans agenda. It had already been planned by Aldous Huxley, brother Julian Huxley, who
[01:31.400 --> 01:40.980]  ran the UN, as a way to end the human family as we know it and create chemicalized, sterilized
[01:40.980 --> 01:49.720]  creatures for depopulation and destroying the existing human order. And that's why it's
[01:49.720 --> 01:56.440]  being promoted by everything from CMT to CNN.
[01:56.440 --> 02:03.740]  Now in public schools across the country, thousands of them, they are keeping the brainwashing
[02:03.740 --> 02:09.500]  programs to get small children to believe they're another sex or not a sex at all. Secret
[02:09.500 --> 02:17.060]  from the parents. And they even have spy grids and create files on the parents and their
[02:17.060 --> 02:23.660]  siblings on how they're going to successfully brainwash and sterilize the child. Big articles
[02:23.660 --> 02:30.220]  from Fox News on that. With the school documents out of Colorado in elementary, middle school
[02:30.220 --> 02:36.000]  and high school, it is total cult brainwashing. We're going to keep you safe. You're really
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.540]  another sex. We're not going to tell your parents. People are not to get you and persecute
[02:40.540 --> 02:47.780]  you. We're going to give you a new secret name. This is 101 hardcore cult brainwashing.
[02:47.780 --> 02:52.220]  This is what the National Education Association is. This is what the teachers unions are.
[02:52.220 --> 02:58.100]  It's the exact same program from Australia to Germany to Canada to the US. They're rolling
[02:58.100 --> 03:02.420]  it out in Africa. They're rolling it out in Latin America. They're rolling it out in Asia.
[03:02.420 --> 03:07.620]  The only place that will allow it is communist China and Russia and some Muslim countries.
[03:07.620 --> 03:15.340]  And as bad as radical, even orthodox Islam is, it is a savior. Christianity won't stand
[03:15.340 --> 03:21.060]  up for itself. I don't mean a savior like Christ, but a savior compared to this. And
[03:21.060 --> 03:31.020]  you know, I'm a big opponent of what is really radical, but orthodox, expansionary Islam.
[03:31.020 --> 03:39.060]  But I've got to be honest. Islam is like a fresh and clean drink of mother's milk compared
[03:39.060 --> 03:42.620]  to this. And the Muslims are not putting up with it all over the West. They're the ones
[03:42.620 --> 03:46.700]  fighting back peacefully, but pulling their kids out, following lawsuits, not putting
[03:46.700 --> 03:52.780]  up with it. Anyone that's insane enough to put their children in a public school or even
[03:52.780 --> 04:02.900]  most of the private schools now where this is actively going on is insane. So MTG did
[04:02.900 --> 04:09.820]  a great job on 60 Minutes with Lesley Stahl when she said, you call Democrats pedos? She
[04:09.820 --> 04:13.420]  said, yeah, well, what do you think it is? Taking them away from their parents, brainwashing
[04:13.420 --> 04:18.060]  them. That's how you control a child more than anything is sexual identity. They're
[04:18.060 --> 04:22.220]  not supposed to do that till they hit puberty and then they learn themselves and their family
[04:22.220 --> 04:28.580]  protects them when they're in society. And they're taught morals to have the state form
[04:28.580 --> 04:34.620]  of sexual relationship with children in the crib. As Bill Clinton's. Attorney General
[04:34.620 --> 04:41.780]  said, reach down and masturbate the babies. She said that they want to put their hands
[04:41.780 --> 04:48.200]  on your children's genitals. It's a pedophile cult, folks, in your face, run by scientists.
[04:48.200 --> 04:52.500]  They want to own your bodies. They want to put poison shots in you and they want access
[04:52.500 --> 05:01.600]  to your children. This is a worldwide death cult now arresting our president.
[05:01.600 --> 05:11.360]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning. If you
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.920]  just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt. I
[05:16.920 --> 05:22.160]  am not seriously planning to run for president. This is an idea the crew had to have a triggering
[05:22.160 --> 05:26.560]  shirt kind of next level. Alex Jones was right. There's info wars dot com in the back. Alex
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.120]  Jones for president 2024 on the front. It's a fundraiser shirts made out of really nice
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.520]  fabric. It's high quality and it is a exclusive shirt to info war store dot com. And when
[05:36.520 --> 05:43.600]  the shirts are gone, they're gone. We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts
[05:43.600 --> 05:47.600]  and we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like minded
[05:47.600 --> 05:53.720]  people and you'll be able to keep us on the air. No way, no way. That's a bridge too far.
[05:53.720 --> 05:58.320]  It's no, it can't be. And I said on national television that he was going to win at info
[05:58.320 --> 06:24.240]  war store.com. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. Welcome to this
[06:24.240 --> 06:30.400]  live Tuesday, April 4th, 2023 transmission. You're watching us via television stations,
[06:30.400 --> 06:38.400]  cable stations or the internet. You can see a shot in front of Trump tower. They also have shots in
[06:38.400 --> 06:46.320]  front of the courthouse. We'll be intermittently going back to where president Trump at two 15
[06:46.320 --> 06:56.240]  Eastern time today, one 15 central time today will be turning himself in to the George Soros
[06:56.240 --> 07:04.080]  installed puppet and the documents and articles are all out and are all confirmed that George
[07:04.080 --> 07:10.840]  Soros put this guy in. He promised to arrest Trump and an Obama lawyer is inside his office
[07:10.840 --> 07:20.440]  orchestrating at all. So when we talk about Joe Biden and his administration, it's really the
[07:20.440 --> 07:26.160]  third administration of Barack Hussein Obama. It's backed by the Bushes and the rest of them.
[07:26.160 --> 07:31.320]  So we go back to George Herbert Walker Bush, the grand football, the new world order. That's one
[07:31.320 --> 07:37.400]  administration that his son is two administrations that Obama is two administrations. And now Biden
[07:37.560 --> 07:43.720]  is the sixth administration of the CIA coup against our country. And then we get a president
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.720]  in love him or hate him, who was actually was the president and actually was calling the shots.
[07:47.720 --> 07:53.560]  They ignored most of his orders. And it is anathema to this group that believes they own this country
[07:53.560 --> 07:59.120]  and they believe they own your body. They believe they own your children. And they have said, hey,
[07:59.120 --> 08:04.000]  prosecutor investigates my son. I hold back a billion bucks. Son of a bitch. He's fired in
[08:04.160 --> 08:10.200]  an hour. Remember that Biden clip or Biden saying that matter, the Russians invade,
[08:10.200 --> 08:15.680]  we will get rid of the Nord Stream pipeline, Nord Stream 2. And they blew it up. And they
[08:15.680 --> 08:20.680]  get some on TV and says, no, we didn't. We know all the documents have come out. They've been
[08:20.680 --> 08:26.960]  kept from Congress. By the way, how is Biden launching this giant war without congressional
[08:26.960 --> 08:33.640]  oversight? And they went and trained separate regular Navy construction crews because the Navy
[08:33.840 --> 08:40.960]  seals under law, the special operation, have to report back to Congress so that that can be kept
[08:40.960 --> 08:48.280]  secret. They had regular crews train and blow it up and it's all come out. The whistleblowers.
[08:48.280 --> 08:54.040]  And I mean, I raise that because these people are lawless crooks who are endangering the whole
[08:54.040 --> 09:04.480]  planet. And then, of course, we have a clip I'll play right now of Biden. And this is Biden saying
[09:04.480 --> 09:16.520]  Trump is not gonna be allowed to be president. This is in September of 2022. Last year, he was
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.960]  asked about Donald Trump running again. He said, we have to demonstrate that we will not take power,
[09:22.960 --> 09:34.040]  read this again. We have to demonstrate that he will not take power if he does run by making sure
[09:34.040 --> 09:39.440]  he, under the legitimate efforts of the Constitution, does not become the next president
[09:39.440 --> 09:46.960]  again. Well, that's a mouthful. We just have to make sure he can't run again legitimately to the
[09:46.960 --> 09:55.360]  Constitution. Wow. Coming from the big guy, coming from one of the most corrupt people ever on planet
[09:55.360 --> 10:04.400]  Earth, Joe Biden, a man who literally gropes children in front of everyone. A man who sold us out
[10:04.400 --> 10:10.680]  to China and Russia, a man who's liquidated the border with massive human smuggling. And now
[10:10.680 --> 10:20.440]  President Trump is gonna be arraigned today. And they're saying Trump's gonna be charged with 34
[10:20.440 --> 10:30.440]  felony counts, no handcuffs, no mug shot, no jail cell, because they know that image really
[10:30.440 --> 10:36.600]  illustrates that they are incredible criminals. While there's lawlessness and murder and death in
[10:36.600 --> 10:44.440]  all the major blue cities, including New York and the same DA, just this week, charged a parking
[10:44.440 --> 10:51.720]  garage attendant who saw a man breaking into cars. It's on surveillance footage. He came over and the
[10:51.720 --> 11:03.600]  man attacked him, took the gun away. But before he took the gun away, he shot the attendant and
[11:04.320 --> 11:10.480]  the attendant took it away from him and shot him. So literally someone pulls a gun on you,
[11:10.480 --> 11:15.440]  they shoot you, you pull it away and shoot them and you get charged with attempted murder.
[11:16.640 --> 11:20.720]  And illegally owning a gun, even though he didn't own the gun. I mean, I read the indictment a few
[11:20.720 --> 11:27.760]  days ago on Saturday and I just couldn't even believe it. Someone attacks you with a gun,
[11:27.760 --> 11:38.240]  you fight for your life and you get charged. That's who these people are, folks.
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.760]  I remember 20 years ago, a man in rural England had been robbed dozens of times.
[11:47.440 --> 11:54.160]  His RV had been stolen. He'd been mugged, he'd been beat up in his house by gypsies that kept
[11:54.160 --> 11:57.840]  robbing him. So he found an old hundred year old shotgun he got from somebody.
[12:00.560 --> 12:04.400]  And when they came back, he shot and wounded one of them. And he spent something like 12
[12:04.400 --> 12:09.680]  years in prison. It was another case in England where a thief was on top of somebody's roof who
[12:09.680 --> 12:16.160]  had a skylight, fell through and broke his leg. And he sued and won against the person.
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.360]  These judges that are leftist know they're bringing down society. They're not bleeding
[12:21.360 --> 12:29.200]  heart idiots. They're at war with us. And so every historian, every analyst agrees that this
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.680]  will tear the country apart and this will weaponize everything and this will move towards
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.880]  Republicans now starting to indict former presidents. And that's what happens in third
[12:38.880 --> 12:42.880]  world countries. That's the hallmark, one of the hallmarks, one of the earmarks,
[12:42.960 --> 12:52.000]  the signature of this. And they don't care because it will destroy the country,
[12:52.880 --> 12:57.120]  just like dissolving the borders and cutting off the pipelines and brainwashing the children that
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.840]  they're another sex and trying to put them on deadly puberty blockers that stunk their growth
[13:01.840 --> 13:06.000]  and screw them up for life and then have them cut body parts off the deeper they get them into the
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.040]  sick cold. Oh, you're a victim. You're depressed because you didn't cut your penis off. You just
[13:11.120 --> 13:17.040]  took chemicals that made it shrivel up. Get rid of that thing. I mean, that's who we're
[13:17.040 --> 13:22.400]  dealing with. And everybody is beginning to realize this who's not part of the cult,
[13:22.400 --> 13:27.280]  but they've got the brainwash seminaries, the brainwash colleges, the brainwash government
[13:27.280 --> 13:33.200]  workers to a great extent. And sitting on top of it, the Justice Department and the FBI
[13:34.160 --> 13:39.120]  that is more than happy to persecute their political enemies while protecting criminals
[13:39.120 --> 13:48.480]  as the whole society collapses. Meanwhile, I said this last week, and now they've got
[13:48.480 --> 13:54.560]  Peter Strzok and all the usual suspects from the FBI all over TV saying Republicans are going to
[13:54.560 --> 14:00.320]  start killing people, bombing people, shooting people. It's imminent. That means they've got
[14:00.320 --> 14:06.640]  meth head mental patients that are schizophrenic in hotel rooms right now with literal MK ultra
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.600]  programming, which is a real thing. It's all come out in the news, telling them that they're
[14:11.600 --> 14:15.680]  the Messiah and they're going to save the earth. It's a well-known brainwashing pattern. That's one
[14:15.680 --> 14:22.240]  of them. CIA just apologized to Canada for the seeking immunity last week for more than 10,000
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.360]  children they kidnapped in the 60s, 70s and 80s. And they were trying to create mind control
[14:27.360 --> 14:33.760]  assassins with them. The Fox News again, it was Friday. Look it up. I mean, you know, I mean,
[14:33.840 --> 14:40.560]  they created armies of these people. Sirhan Sirhan drugged up. He didn't shoot Robert F.
[14:40.560 --> 14:45.600]  Kennedy Jr. in the back. The CIA operative from the skunkworks did. And that was all witnessed
[14:45.600 --> 14:52.320]  by people as well. Sirhan Sirhan was drugged up on an amnesia drug. He didn't remember any of it.
[14:53.360 --> 14:59.840]  He was there with a gun in his hand, did none of the shooting. So they've got Sirhan Sirhans
[14:59.840 --> 15:11.680]  and John Hinckley Jr. in the hotel rooms, in the farms, you know, in the woods. They've got them
[15:11.680 --> 15:19.200]  outside the cities and outside the towns, ready to roll them in with truck bombs and just machine gun
[15:19.200 --> 15:25.360]  attacks and everything else. And this is the last phase. In Dike Trump, start blowing stuff up.
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.520]  And if I was evil and if I was them and the same group that runs things today,
[15:29.520 --> 15:35.840]  did Oklahoma City and so much more, hopefully we can stop them by talking about this. But
[15:36.480 --> 15:40.640]  they've got the truck bombs loaded right now. You can bet your bottom dollar in this coup
[15:40.640 --> 15:46.880]  against America. And of course, when they blow up stuff, I will be blamed. And so will you.
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.840]  But remember, we told you who had the motive, who did it in the past and who stands the game.
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.000]  We'll be right back with so much today when our country is under attack.
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.760]  Such great things for the body. Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential
[16:25.760 --> 16:32.640]  oils. It is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth. I want to
[16:32.640 --> 16:38.160]  challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at mfootworkstore.com. Dr. Jones Naturals,

[17:12.480 --> 17:23.360]  to take the truck out.
[17:42.480 --> 18:04.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, the great reset in the world for the world is a historic book
[18:04.560 --> 18:09.680]  that documents the globalist in their own words plan for our future. That is a hellish future.
[18:09.680 --> 18:13.280]  Now you'll be always, while they sell a lot of books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[18:13.280 --> 18:17.280]  be able to get an unsigned copy of the great reset and the war for the world at bookstores,
[18:17.280 --> 18:22.240]  Amazon or mfootworkstore.com. But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[18:22.240 --> 18:27.280]  after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[18:27.280 --> 18:32.640]  So get your copy of the great reset and the war for the world, a signed copy at mfootworkstore.com.
[18:32.640 --> 18:37.120]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air. So you won't
[18:37.120 --> 18:41.680]  just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also know that you help keep info
[18:41.680 --> 18:44.720]  wars on the air. I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.800]  or unsigned copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to mfootworkstore.com
[18:50.800 --> 18:55.280]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or
[18:55.280 --> 18:59.200]  give them to the local school. This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your
[18:59.200 --> 19:08.480]  support. This is their big move. So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters
[19:08.480 --> 19:14.000]  in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the president of the United
[19:14.000 --> 19:22.000]  States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists. Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[19:22.560 --> 19:32.160]  They must be opposed. And that's only understand one word. No, no, no. Exactly. And that's why we
[19:32.160 --> 19:39.840]  say no to your vaccine. We say no to you shutting down our businesses. We say no to you taking our
[19:39.840 --> 19:45.360]  firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say no to you selling us out to the
[19:45.360 --> 19:49.920]  World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into World War III. You're right.
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.320]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no and we say no to your war.
[20:01.440 --> 20:10.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:19.920 --> 20:32.080]  America and our great republic could not be taken down from without,
[20:33.440 --> 20:39.840]  but it can be taken down from within. And that's exactly what we're all witnessing
[20:41.360 --> 20:48.240]  here today. The weaponization of the legal system, the criminal justice system. But everything has
[20:48.240 --> 20:55.040]  been weaponized against us. We have to recognize that a predatory corporate world model that is
[20:55.040 --> 21:04.640]  designed to destroy society is in place working against us right now. I mentioned this Joe Biden
[21:04.640 --> 21:13.040]  clip from September of last year. Here it is. The conversation was tied to your predecessor,
[21:13.600 --> 21:20.080]  who is about to launch another campaign. So how do you reassure them if that is the reason for
[21:20.080 --> 21:25.280]  their questioning that the former president will not return, that his political movement,
[21:25.280 --> 21:30.240]  which is still very strong, will not again take power in the United States?
[21:30.960 --> 21:40.000]  Well, we just have to demonstrate that he will not take power by, if he does run,
[21:40.720 --> 21:46.880]  making sure he, under the legitimate efforts of our Constitution, does not become the next
[21:46.880 --> 21:57.040]  president again. And there you go. Total election meddling telling 90 million people that voted for
[21:57.040 --> 22:04.400]  Trump, you can't vote for who you want. You can't vote for a former president we stole an election
[22:04.400 --> 22:09.520]  from. And we're going to charge him at the state and federal level all over the country.
[22:10.400 --> 22:14.320]  They're now reporting, suddenly all the other investigations are hot and more indictments
[22:14.320 --> 22:23.440]  are coming. And that's their strategy. Okay, New York and the Manhattan DA put in there by Soros.
[22:23.440 --> 22:28.720]  This has made Trump go up 30 points in the polls. But once they start hitting him with Georgia,
[22:29.600 --> 22:32.880]  and then with DC, and then with federal,
[22:34.560 --> 22:38.080]  well, he must be bad. I mean, there's all these indictments.
[22:39.680 --> 22:46.560]  Trump charged with 34 felony counts, no handcuffs, no mugshot, no jail cell. New York has introduced
[22:46.560 --> 22:53.040]  legislation that's set to pass overriding the judges because they want this to be a televised
[22:53.600 --> 23:04.240]  Kangaroo trial. He will be again showing up at 2.15 Eastern, 1.15 Central. We'll have live
[23:04.240 --> 23:10.320]  coverage and we'll also skip the breaks when that is happening. Trump's trial could be televised
[23:10.320 --> 23:20.480]  under New Albany Bill. Trump returns to New York to face historic criminal charges.
[23:23.040 --> 23:31.680]  Trump arraignment judge denies motion to allow live cameras as former president faces criminal
[23:31.680 --> 23:38.240]  charges. Roger Stone says Trump gag order could constitute election interference. Think so?
[23:40.080 --> 23:44.080]  Trump is losing his capacity to control his fate with legal threats swirling.
[23:44.080 --> 23:53.600]  Video, former anti-Trump FBI agent claims GOP criticism of FBI will lead to violence.
[23:54.560 --> 23:59.600]  And that's what the mayor of New York is saying, that MTG coming and protesting,
[23:59.600 --> 24:04.320]  who has no criminal record and is calling for peace, is hate speech and warns her
[24:05.120 --> 24:10.640]  these people are thugs. As Marjorie Taylor Greene leads protests against Trump indictment,
[24:10.640 --> 24:18.880]  New York City mayor has a message for her. You got to see this about the misplaced
[24:18.880 --> 24:26.800]  anger and rabble rousing and hate speech. XAG Bill Barr, Trump indictment, an abomination
[24:27.680 --> 24:32.960]  that makes us look like a banana republic. When we don't look like one, we are. Jim Jordan,
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.280]  Trump indictment is about going after anyone who opposes the left's agenda, the establishment's
[24:37.280 --> 24:45.280]  agenda. Bingo. Breaking attorney Matt Colanello, if I'm saying that right,
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.640]  Colin Jello is the link between Soros back DA Bragg's office and the Obama White House and the
[24:52.640 --> 25:00.960]  Biden DOJ. Trump taps white collar attorney to helm indictment defense, Todd Blanch.
[25:00.960 --> 25:07.680]  Manhattan's DA office purges executive staff section from website.
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.240]  And of course, it's a bunch of Soros and communists and leftists. It's an incredible breakdown.
[25:18.160 --> 25:24.000]  Meanwhile, President Trump is way up in all the polls since indictment, crushing the field.
[25:24.000 --> 25:34.320]  That's just some of the news and information going to be laying out here
[25:35.760 --> 25:38.560]  today. But Trump arrived last night. He's in New York.
[25:40.560 --> 25:47.120]  See the crowds out there. It is a carnival atmosphere.
[25:47.120 --> 25:56.000]  It's beyond upsetting what's happening because this is the takedown of the country.
[25:57.600 --> 26:04.880]  And then I have clips of New York assembly people of New Jersey, Democrat leader of the
[26:08.400 --> 26:12.160]  press secretary of the governor of Arizona. I mean, I've got dozens of these
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.800]  and videos all over the country of trans rallies that happen, I guess,
[26:16.800 --> 26:22.960]  every weekend now around the country in different cities being asked, will you decry the woman or
[26:22.960 --> 26:30.400]  man that went and killed the three little children and the three adults in cold blood was trying to
[26:30.400 --> 26:36.800]  kill more, trying to kill a bunch of police. She shot them out the window as they came in
[26:36.800 --> 26:44.960]  and they say, nope, we won't. And just everywhere the left has been celebrating it and saying,
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.760]  this is what you get. So those nine year old children that she gunned down,
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.400]  that's what you get. And the Internet just flooded with, I mean, I'm not even looking for it.
[26:56.400 --> 27:01.440]  It's just everywhere with trans people saying, we're oppressed. You're killing us. We're going
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.560]  to come kill you. And they go, we have the highest suicide rate. We have the highest death rate
[27:06.640 --> 27:14.880]  because they're almost half of them in studies are sex workers and are in a really destructive
[27:14.880 --> 27:20.800]  lifestyle in a sex cult. And they're killing themselves and they're being killed, not by us,
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.520]  but by their pimps and all this. And then they point at conservatives thinking we want to run
[27:25.520 --> 27:30.880]  around and, quote, hurt people in drag or we want to ban books. No, we're saying you can't have
[27:30.880 --> 27:35.760]  pedophilic books telling kids to get in the back of a van with a guy when they come to your backyard
[27:37.360 --> 27:41.280]  and then it shows the man having sex with a child and how wonderful it is.
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.280]  That's just one of the books. We don't want that in school libraries. And
[27:45.280 --> 27:50.960]  people get up and ask legislatures, they get up and ask city councils. We've played the videos.
[27:52.240 --> 28:00.320]  They start reading penthouse write ups about sex. That's about adults having sex.
[28:00.640 --> 28:06.720]  And they say, would this be OK in the school? And they say, we can't answer that because
[28:06.720 --> 28:10.080]  everybody knows you don't put penthouse in the elementary school or the high school.
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.880]  But penthouse doesn't tell, hey, if you're in a backyard and a man next door in my chin is shed
[28:16.880 --> 28:24.000]  and wants to give you a blowjob, go ahead and go over. You'll like it. It'll be fun. Ask the man
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.440]  to give you a blowjob and then, oh, if a man asks you to these are books in school.
[28:29.440 --> 28:34.160]  If a nice man wants to just give you pleasure. Remember what Oprah Winfrey said a few years ago?
[28:34.160 --> 28:39.680]  She said, well, kids don't know it's abuse. They like it. Of course, she was famously
[28:39.680 --> 28:45.360]  abused and a sex slave and then a prostitute and all the rest of it. So, I mean, these people are
[28:46.160 --> 28:52.720]  a sex cult and they are sexualizing our children. It is a pedophile cult because that's how you
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.520]  control the future. If you can if you can form their sexual identities, you've won.
[29:22.720 --> 29:27.920]  Jones was right. Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[29:27.920 --> 29:31.600]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[29:31.600 --> 29:37.680]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago. Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax,
[29:37.680 --> 29:43.840]  not for a second. You are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the
[29:43.840 --> 29:49.520]  First Amendment. The government fears Alex Jones. That's why the globalists hate me
[29:49.520 --> 29:52.480]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[30:00.560 --> 30:04.080]  I intend to take the Infowars
[30:05.360 --> 30:10.320]  armored truck out or the Infowars tank, as it's so lovingly called. You came through yesterday
[30:10.320 --> 30:22.880]  and shopped at Infowars store dot com. So I'm going to be able to take the truck out.

[31:58.160 --> 32:08.240]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane place.
[32:08.240 --> 32:12.640]  World War Three has already started. Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders. There's
[32:12.640 --> 32:16.880]  mass censorship. James O'Keefe has been removed from Project Veritas. The list goes on and on
[32:16.880 --> 32:20.480]  of the bad things that are happening. But the good things that are happening is humanity is
[32:20.480 --> 32:25.360]  really accelerating its awakening. But those of us on the forefront are under more attack
[32:25.360 --> 32:29.280]  by the establishment than ever. That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the
[32:29.280 --> 32:33.680]  broadcast, to pray for the broadcast and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products

[32:54.960 --> 33:06.000]  action now at Infowars store. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[33:06.000 --> 33:20.800]  It's Alex Jones. Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[33:20.800 --> 33:32.240]  All right, this massive Trump indictment, 34 indictments is a felony action by
[33:33.120 --> 33:38.960]  Albert the chipmunk brag. And Trump's lead lawyer on a clip coming up of that
[33:39.680 --> 33:43.680]  made that point. He said this is a felony to leak this. But of course,
[33:43.680 --> 33:49.840]  it was a felony to leak the Supreme Court ruling. But the FBI can't find out who did that either.
[33:51.200 --> 33:57.200]  Because they probably did it. And you remember Comey telling Congress he never leaked anything.
[33:58.240 --> 34:06.000]  But it turned out he leaked over 500 times, but he went, Oh, no, I gave it to a university professor
[34:06.000 --> 34:18.240]  dean. Who then gave it to the media. That's like a mafia don on the stand saying I didn't order
[34:19.120 --> 34:28.640]  the murder of say a rival crime boss. I ordered the captain in that area
[34:29.360 --> 34:41.200]  to order his soldiers to do it. Oh, no, we we don't leak anything. We just give it
[34:41.200 --> 34:48.000]  to a university professor who does it all. Okay, that'd be like
[34:52.880 --> 34:57.920]  if I was a kingpin drug dealer, selling 1000 keys of cocaine
[35:00.080 --> 35:08.720]  a month. And they caught me ordering my minions to go sell it.
[35:09.360 --> 35:14.400]  And then I go, Well, I don't deal the cocaine myself. I don't break it up and cut it and mix
[35:14.400 --> 35:20.480]  it and then distribute it. I mean, I just ship it in from Colombia. I'm not the cocaine dealer here.
[35:21.920 --> 35:28.240]  And they just none of this even makes sense. They just bombard us with nonsense and just
[35:28.240 --> 35:37.120]  normalize all this craziness. It is a felony, a lot of Congress and Comey did it over and over
[35:37.200 --> 35:40.880]  again. All of them did it. And
[35:45.280 --> 35:49.200]  the only person I haven't seen lie in front of Congress of these people from the tech heads,
[35:49.200 --> 35:53.680]  you name it, is Redfield. He's like, Yeah, we made the virus, cooked up the lab,
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.720]  probably released it on purpose. And we're making stuff even worse. It's just stop. And
[35:58.720 --> 36:02.160]  I'm not gonna lie. Meanwhile, all the other scientists get up there and go,
[36:02.160 --> 36:07.760]  We have never even heard of gain of function. We're like, Well, here's 50 emails of you saying,
[36:07.760 --> 36:15.280]  This is the greatest gain of function. We need to do more of this. It's just the level of the line.
[36:17.120 --> 36:25.760]  And the level of the spin is insane. And the thing is, they're not getting in trouble for it.
[36:26.800 --> 36:31.840]  So you've got to ask what's coming next. Well, Roger Stone's to talk about that with us in the
[36:32.080 --> 36:34.400]  next hour. The judge, Henry Napolitano joins us after that.
[36:36.640 --> 36:41.520]  It is a circus circus in New York. A lot of people ask me, they said, Why didn't you send
[36:41.520 --> 36:49.120]  Owen Schroyer up there to cover this? Oh, it's not allowed to leave. He's on pretrial probation
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.840]  charged facing a year in prison for being with me outside the Capitol, trying to stop people going
[36:55.840 --> 37:03.840]  in. And by the way, in their filing post arrest, the FBI on the Justice Department,
[37:03.840 --> 37:07.600]  I've read it on air, said that Owen went to the Capitol and attacked people.
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.000]  Now, it's all verifiable on body cams that he did no such thing, but they don't care because they
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.040]  can commit felonies. The judges have said the FBI is allowed to lie. The judges don't even think
[37:19.040 --> 37:24.480]  it's a big deal. They're like, Oh, okay. He went inside and attacked people and led people into
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.120]  the Capitol and attacked inside the Capitol. Okay, okay. And they're going to, if he doesn't
[37:29.120 --> 37:35.200]  plead guilty, they're going to put him in a new D.C. jury. And they're not going to put on any
[37:35.200 --> 37:43.280]  evidence that it's going to say, well, the FBI agent. He says that you did this and here's a
[37:43.280 --> 37:50.480]  sworn affidavit from the Justice Department. It's like saying Dumbo's a documentary and elephants
[37:50.480 --> 37:56.960]  fly with their ears. And it's such a level of evil and it's so transparent. It doesn't make me
[37:56.960 --> 38:01.520]  mad anymore. I'm like, why do you people act like this? Why would you want to do this to your own
[38:01.520 --> 38:09.680]  country? Why are you so horrible? What is your problem? Well, look at Strzok's testimony,
[38:09.680 --> 38:14.320]  how demonic he looks. Like if I tried to look demonic and I'm pretty good with my
[38:14.400 --> 38:16.240]  facial expressions, I couldn't look that evil.
[38:20.640 --> 38:28.400]  Like Guimer Wormtongue from Lord of the Rings. I mean, it's like, who are these people?
[38:30.640 --> 38:37.680]  Kissing. Anderson Cooper sometimes will be acting totally normal and then all of a sudden his face
[38:37.680 --> 38:45.920]  goes totally demonic and he goes, let me show folks the Anderson Cooper face. All of a sudden
[38:45.920 --> 38:53.120]  he'll be like, I can't even make the face. It looks right back to normal. It looks just like
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.600]  Strzok. I can't even make the faces. There's an animated gif of a bunch of Strzok's faces together
[38:57.600 --> 39:06.560]  that shows it. I mean, these people are frickin' crazy, man. They are nuts. And all I want is away
[39:06.560 --> 39:10.400]  from them. I don't want to be in power. I don't want to be in Hollywood. I don't want to be in
[39:10.400 --> 39:17.600]  the DC club. I just want you to leave us alone, you evil people. I mean, I've got stacks of them,
[39:18.560 --> 39:23.520]  all the major hospitals in the country. I mean, the big ones are gearing up to perform
[39:23.520 --> 39:28.720]  millions of castrations of little boys. I've got the articles right here.
[39:28.720 --> 39:32.160]  Hundreds of thousands ain't enough, folks.
[39:40.480 --> 39:45.520]  So let's get into that and let's get into the latest developments with the RESTRICT Act because
[39:47.600 --> 39:50.000]  all of this is part of the net we've been caught in
[39:50.960 --> 39:54.800]  by these psychotics that are putting themselves in the net too.
[39:58.720 --> 40:05.280]  They really are demonic. They really want to hurt good people. They really want to hurt children.
[40:06.080 --> 40:10.160]  And I've got video after video, I played them some last week, but I watched like 15 of them this
[40:10.160 --> 40:16.640]  weekend, of Democrats going, got what you deserve. You guys tried to pass a law to persecute trans
[40:16.640 --> 40:21.520]  people in Tennessee and you saw what happened. Yeah, we saw you shoot at the cops and kill
[40:21.520 --> 40:25.840]  little kids and shoot them in the head and shoot them in the chest and shoot the teacher and shoot
[40:25.840 --> 40:35.360]  the principal. Man, we saw it. She's a victim. He's a victim. That poor victim she sure showed you.
[40:39.520 --> 40:41.920]  And it's not just crazy leftists at rallies that are like,
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.800]  we're not going to decry what he did. You persecuted us. The hell we did. You're a damn
[40:48.800 --> 40:53.840]  cult run by the CIA or the Tabistock Institute, taking over our world and coming after our kids.
[40:55.840 --> 41:00.240]  20 years ago, if you imagine something like this, it'd be fantastical. I told you it was coming,
[41:00.240 --> 41:05.920]  reading their documents. But it's something entirely different when you're actually living it.
[41:05.920 --> 41:10.720]  So we're going to go to break, but I'm going to start getting to these clips. Here's MTG being
[41:10.720 --> 41:18.240]  gaslit by Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes. And she says, the Democrats are pedophilic? No, the whole
[41:18.240 --> 41:21.760]  globalist system is. All the big corporations funding this to form a relationship with a child,
[41:21.760 --> 41:25.520]  to keep a secret from the parents, to tell them they're another sex, to try to get them on
[41:25.520 --> 41:31.920]  chemicals that affect their puberty and stunt their growth and to put them on skids, on rails,
[41:31.920 --> 41:36.720]  to be sterilized. That's beyond just molesting them. That's trying to destroy them.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.640]  But they made it fashionable and a right and said the group they're targeting is being persecuted
[41:42.640 --> 41:48.160]  by those of us trying to save them. Everything is inverted with these people. Here they are gaslighting.
[41:48.960 --> 41:54.720]  Says that are over the top, like the Democrats are a party of pedophiles.
[41:55.600 --> 41:58.720]  I would definitely say so. They support grooming children.
[41:59.280 --> 42:06.160]  They are not pedophiles. Why would you say that? Democrats, Democrats support even Joe Biden,
[42:06.160 --> 42:11.120]  the president himself supports children being sexualized and having transgender
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.560]  surgeries. Sexualizing children is what pedophiles do to children.
[42:14.560 --> 42:24.960]  Wow. OK. Wow. Jocelyn Elders, when she was being confirmed and she wasn't confirmed
[42:24.960 --> 42:30.560]  as the surgeon general in 1993, and you can read her writings everywhere,
[42:30.560 --> 42:35.440]  said we need to masturbate the boys and girls at six months of age
[42:35.440 --> 42:40.400]  and that the preschools need to be trained by law to get all the children.
[42:40.400 --> 42:47.120]  I mean, you imagine you walk in, your husband or wife is diddling the baby. You're going to you're
[42:47.120 --> 42:51.760]  going to jail. You're going to break their neck. But they just do it right out in the open like
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.160]  we're good. We're going to diddle your children. We're going to reach down and masturbate.
[43:00.400 --> 43:06.800]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[43:07.760 --> 43:15.120]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[43:15.840 --> 43:20.320]  I am not seriously planning to run for president. This is an idea the crew had
[43:20.320 --> 43:23.600]  to have a triggering shirt kind of next level. Alex Jones is right.
[43:23.600 --> 43:28.000]  There's info wars dot com in the back. Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.600]  It's a fundraiser shirts made out of really nice fabric. It's high quality
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.480]  and it is a exclusive shirt info war store dot com. And when the shirts are gone,
[43:36.960 --> 43:42.000]  they're gone. We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[43:42.560 --> 43:45.600]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word,
[43:45.600 --> 43:49.760]  meet a lot of like minded people and you will be able to keep us on the air.
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.160]  No way. No way. That's a bridge too far. That's no, it can't be.
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.120]  And I said on national television that he was going to win at info war store dot com.
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.680]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[44:06.240 --> 44:09.440]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[44:10.160 --> 44:14.240]  When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[44:15.600 --> 44:21.280]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[44:21.280 --> 44:26.560]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just
[44:26.560 --> 44:30.880]  incredible. So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[44:31.520 --> 44:36.640]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars can not stay on air if you do not support us.
[44:37.280 --> 44:40.560]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But
[44:41.200 --> 44:45.840]  most viewers and listeners never go to info war store.com and you never buy great products
[44:45.840 --> 44:50.160]  that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time, give us on air. I know that less than
[44:50.160 --> 44:55.680]  1% of our listeners actually go buy products in four store.com. If just 1% more of you took action
[44:55.680 --> 44:59.520]  and went to info store.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[45:25.680 --> 45:29.600]  And let the children to die on the cold floor. It was almost as if it were a plan.
[45:35.840 --> 45:40.240]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions. You guys
[45:40.240 --> 45:46.160]  censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices. What we want to do in Davos is
[45:46.160 --> 45:52.400]  push the reset button. As soon as we start exposing the great reset the sooner these
[45:52.400 --> 45:54.400]  globalists start going to prison.
[46:00.400 --> 46:08.480]  I intend to take the info wars armored truck out or the info wars tank as it's so lovingly
[46:08.480 --> 46:12.480]  called. You came through yesterday and shopped at info war store.com. So I'm going to be able
[46:12.480 --> 46:16.560]  to take the truck out.
[46:42.480 --> 47:08.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[47:12.480 --> 47:25.200]  So what's the hallmark of a child abuser of a molester of one of these truly evil scumbags
[47:25.200 --> 47:34.400]  of scumbags. They have techniques and they have systems of training children by increments
[47:34.400 --> 47:42.000]  to accept more and more abuse and then never tell authorities or their parents and now
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  you're just seeing the complete main lining of that. I want to play the MTG clip one more
[47:46.000 --> 47:52.000]  time because when you see these articles coming out every day they come out in Texas. They
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.040]  come out in Colorado. They come out in New York. They come out in Tennessee. They come
[47:55.040 --> 47:59.360]  out in Idaho. They come out in California. They come out everywhere. It's the same in
[47:59.360 --> 48:05.040]  Australia. Same in France. Same in the UK. All the lesser countries. Massive corporate
[48:05.040 --> 48:11.920]  funding and they go oh sexualizing kids is drag queen time. Not that we're against men
[48:11.920 --> 48:17.120]  dressing up like women. I mean hell Bob Hope did that. The Three Stooges did that. Police
[48:17.120 --> 48:22.000]  Academy is hilarious where they dress up like girls infiltrate the prostitutes. The point
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.320]  is Steven Crowder has gone and done that. I even dressed up like Wonder Woman as a joke
[48:28.320 --> 48:34.400]  on a comedy show once. It was hilarious but I wasn't shaking my ass in front of kids and
[48:34.400 --> 48:40.080]  telling them they're another sex. That's what this is. I didn't have little kids putting
[48:40.080 --> 48:46.880]  g-strings in my thumb. I mean putting $20 bills in my g-string. I wasn't wearing a g-string
[48:46.880 --> 48:52.720]  either. I was wearing a funny wig but so they misrepresent that oh you want to ban books. No
[48:52.720 --> 48:58.400]  we don't want you giving pedophilic books that are probably illegal to children.
[48:58.400 --> 49:04.960]  Oh you want to ban drag shows. No knock yourselves out.
[49:06.160 --> 49:09.120]  Just don't have them be sexually lewd and have children there.
[49:09.840 --> 49:13.040]  So we all know what this is. This is all accepted fact.
[49:14.560 --> 49:18.000]  What you always see is an article here an article there. It's going on
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.360]  everywhere and you've got to go read the article on Infowars.com
[49:22.960 --> 49:28.160]  and then it links through to the Fox News article because I spent an hour this morning. An hour I
[49:28.160 --> 49:36.800]  didn't have. I got up about 5 a.m. got some coffee. Took a shower about 5 30. One of my friends
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.560]  sends me a Fox News link and I'll show you the article and I ended up clicking and reading more
[49:42.560 --> 49:52.320]  than 30 pages of the school documents and ladies and gentlemen they hand out little brochures to
[49:52.320 --> 49:58.000]  the elementary kids and say you could be a walrus. You could be a tiger or you could be a unicorn.
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.160]  You could be things that don't exist but it's important when you're deciding maybe you're a
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.960]  boy maybe you're a girl maybe you're something else that you not tell your parents because
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.320]  you're going to be a superhero now just like the ads saying you're a superhero when you take the
[50:12.320 --> 50:19.440]  shots and you don't want your parents to know and then here's the key it goes through how the school
[50:20.400 --> 50:29.040]  working with outside NGOs intelligence agencies profiles the parents and siblings in a file
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.520]  these are school records that the parents can't see to decide if the parents can be told their
[50:35.520 --> 50:41.680]  child as young as five is transitioning they then give the child these are their teachers they
[50:41.680 --> 50:48.000]  believe they're to instruct them that they're another sex they're given a new name but told
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.040]  your mommy and daddy might hurt you you're persecuted now because you're in this special
[50:53.040 --> 50:58.640]  group and have won this prize these are children the types that would get in the van with a killer
[50:58.640 --> 51:05.680]  because they don't know hey I got a puppy hey I got candy they tell them you are like a superhero
[51:05.680 --> 51:11.200]  you could be anything you want you could be a unicorn you could be a bear you could be a boy
[51:11.200 --> 51:12.960]  I'm a girl you could be a boy
[51:16.400 --> 51:19.760]  we're going to have a drag queen come in here now and tell you that okay he's a convicted
[51:19.760 --> 51:26.800]  pedophile but it's okay liberal so this is such psychological abuse to then get them in the system
[51:26.800 --> 51:31.440]  confuse them screw them up get them on puberty blockers and then have them surgically remove
[51:31.440 --> 51:37.280]  their breasts their penises and their testicles here's the bow down article on info wars.com
[51:37.280 --> 51:40.960]  Colorado district keeping school sanctioned gender transition secret from parents
[51:41.520 --> 51:48.320]  and then again the gender unicorn they start teaching them in elementary school that they
[51:48.880 --> 51:54.400]  could be different and then they ask little boys are you attracted little boys well little boys
[51:54.400 --> 52:00.640]  are obviously attracted little boys to play with them with blocks and with toy guns and fort and
[52:00.640 --> 52:05.600]  they ask little girls do you like boys or girls more and when the little girl says I like girls
[52:05.600 --> 52:14.160]  more because girls want to play with girls mainly you are a lesbian you love girls girls yeah I like
[52:14.160 --> 52:23.360]  girls this is written by psychological warfare experts the same curriculum worldwide corporately
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.960]  force-fed to and they go oh you're abusing the children they're in the elite club that's why
[52:28.960 --> 52:36.400]  places like San Francisco and Seattle up to 60 percent of the children identify as trans
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.080]  because they think they're being like it's like a superhero what superhero are you
[52:42.080 --> 52:44.640]  aquaman or you wonder woman are you no no no
[52:49.840 --> 52:57.840]  unbelievable and it's all the documents look at this where it says we have to
[52:57.840 --> 53:04.480]  profile the siblings we have to profile the parents and we cannot let them know in elementary
[53:04.480 --> 53:10.720]  middle school and high school that this is going on and these are secret documents for the safety
[53:10.720 --> 53:17.600]  of the children a total cult here's the full article fox news Colorado district
[53:17.600 --> 53:28.800]  equality docs equity docs reveal the methodical system to deceive parents
[53:31.200 --> 53:35.600]  on in-school social transitions because they don't want a school where you learn reading writing

[53:55.360 --> 54:00.160]  director calls for drastic increase in capacity for gender surgery for minors and they're gearing
[54:00.160 --> 54:06.560]  up they're saying we make a lot of money off this a and b it's not a plastic surgery but they get
[54:06.560 --> 54:12.960]  like twice the money but it's attached to a whole political system we need to be able to serve
[54:13.920 --> 54:19.840]  millions of people it's like oh we're all so loving we're all so open we want to put
[54:19.840 --> 54:23.760]  kids on drugs and sterilize them oh we're all so nice
[54:30.320 --> 54:36.000]  i mean that's what evil looks like folks that's what a cult looks like
[54:36.800 --> 54:42.400]  and i grew up in dallas and i liked football but i got so sick of the dallas cowboys and the cult
[54:42.400 --> 54:46.320]  of the game and it's all everybody talked about and the flags everywhere and it was just
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.840]  by the time i was you know older i just hated it but that wasn't a cult teaching kids how to cut
[54:51.840 --> 54:59.040]  their penises off or or not telling parents they're brainwashing kids illegally right under

[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.760]  of his sperm cells you cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance yeah that seems mildly
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:55.520]  inappropriate for a political discussion there's all these calls here for the international day
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.000]  of rage of the trans people men that think they're women and women that think they're
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.520]  men out with sandwich boards with images of rifles saying trans rights or else and the
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:14.720]  main trans resistance movement came out and said the shooter's a victim to you made him do it when
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.840]  it's a her one of the things that we saw during the midterm elections is that people don't want
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.840]  their freedoms to be taken they want us to fight for their freedoms and so it is shameful it is
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:32.800]  disturbing and our hearts go out to those the trans community as they are under attack right
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:38.960]  now in the fight for human rights we must affirm that trans rights are human rights
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:48.640]  hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey guys
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.600]  this guy just shot the old guy right down on the ground there is still a lot that we don't know
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.400]  about monday's horrific and deadly mass shooting at a nashville christian school but after police
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:04.320]  said the suspect was transgender one thing is clear tennessee's already under siege transgender
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:11.680]  community is terrified one advocate told nbc news we are already fearing for our lives now it's even
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:17.360]  worse the right-wing moral panic over transgender people living their lives or seeking medical care
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:23.440]  or simply existing obviously predates the nashville massacre but some on the right are
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:29.680]  linking the tragedy to their raging nationwide crusade against transgender people in ways that
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.840]  are just dangerous and frankly evil three adults two nine-year-olds and one about to turn nine had
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.000]  been shot dead moreover when we advance equal equality and racial justice we're and invest in
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.760]  young people protect the lgbtq plus uh individuals our societies are not only fair but they're
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:57.600]  stronger international day of rage and violence coming up april 1st and it's an image of a trans
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:04.080]  person with an ar-15 nobody's gonna save them why the state isn't getting access to children
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.520]  to sterilize them that they're putting up a little bit of a fight so the answer is let's go out and
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:16.080]  get violent notice a pattern colorado springs shooter identifies as non-binary denver shooter
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:22.560]  identified as trans the avaldi shooter was into that too aberdeen shooter identifies as trans
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:29.440]  nashville shooter identified as trans confused freaked out whacked out people
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:37.760]  on major major major hormones someone who identifies as transgender however that's not
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:44.160]  a problem in their body gender identity all identities they're in our thoughts thoughts
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:51.200]  and feelings those are not hardwired they develop and they may be factually wrong or factually
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:04:09.520]  correct the definition of a delusion is a fixed false belief a lot of these people that identify
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.800]  as non-binary or transgender or high functioning autist you'll see now in the media they're
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:20.880]  talking about aubrey hale is a high functioning autist so that is the crux of this problem is
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.840]  that we're basically enabling people that are actually mentally challenged it's even stronger
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.960]  than gender dysphoria they're actually suffering from autism and that is why this society is
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.120]  getting so bad because the increased rate of autism is going to only increase the rate of
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.480]  transgenderism it's very sad but they're howling they're they're barking at the moon they're
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.120]  chirping and they're just rolling them in like here's where your love here's where you're
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:51.520]  accepted here's some fat men dressed like getting a clown many of them convicted pedophiles
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:05:03.360]  and this is just the army of evil rolling forward the most banned man in america alex jones
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:14.480]  i want you all to know something alex jones was right alex is right about far more than he's
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:20.640]  wrong alex has been right on toward over a decade i don't care how you slice it dice it flip it up
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.880]  or rub it down alex jones was right think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.600]  a year or two imagine being like an alex jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:38.640]  alex jones called this years ago years ago alex jones never bought the russia hoax not for a second
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:45.760]  you are one of the great thinkers of this you are a martyr to the first amendment the government
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.440]  fears alex jones that's why the globalists hate me is because i'm exposing their corporate
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:06:05.840]  worldwide tyranny the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:19.840]  so
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:35.440]  ladies and gentlemen america is under globalist attack because trump is the president and it's
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:41.840]  going to win reelection handily they have 34 indictments he's set in about an hour and 10
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.840]  minutes from now to turn himself in they know that it's backfired on them so they're not going to have
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:54.480]  him in handcuffs he will not be put in jail there will be no mugshot but this was only the opening
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:00.640]  salvo as roger stone predicted a week and a half ago he said they're still going to indict him
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.840]  i don't believe this hiatus and there'll be more indictments after that this is just the opening
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:13.520]  salvo these people cannot help themselves no other elites in 240 plus years ever did this
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:22.880]  this opens pandora's box this is so incredibly dangerous so nobody other than trump has been
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:30.160]  as in deep a fight with the deep state as roger stone i've been one level removed and it's been
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:35.440]  hell and i'm not complaining i'm not being a wimp i'm not saying poor me i'm a warrior
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:41.360]  i asked for this i stepped to the plate i told roger seven years ago when trump six and a half
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.360]  years ago that on election night and he's told the story many times i said now they're coming
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:50.720]  after us because trump is a maverick the the the bureaucracy is going to try to destroy everybody
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:57.760]  i could feel the danger at a spiritual level a danger i'd never felt i knew the enemy was coming
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:04.720]  then and here we are so when i tell you that and when trump tells you hey they're not coming after
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.400]  me they're coming after you i'm standing up for you that's why they're coming after me i really
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:17.120]  care about you i i'm i'm interconnected i have empathy as an instinct that god gave me because
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:22.160]  how you get treated is how i'm going to get treated the left again are like people that
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.280]  piss in the public pool
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.960]  and enough of them do it the pool is full of acid and they have to drain it and it it's hellish
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:36.480]  the globalists are like people that take dumps in the pool it gets on them too but they don't
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.480]  care and now the pool looks like a giant open-air porta potty and and they're getting rid of all the
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.760]  chivalry they're getting rid of the checks and balances they're getting rid of all of it as if
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:53.280]  they're not swimming in the same sh dash t that we are and that's what tyrannies are when people
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.960]  get rid of the checks and balances and people weaponize the system it it it then gets turned
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.520]  on them i don't want to turn this on them because then it'll get turned back even worse it goes in
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:10.560]  this cycle this cauldron so there's so many facets to this roger and i want to go through your key
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.080]  points you want to get out right now and then at the bottom of the hour i i tried to bring
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:22.560]  this up with you last week you kind of stepped over it and so did uh allen dershowitz and i
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:31.280]  don't know why uh but obviously the next move and i've now seen their usual fbi suspects all over
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.960]  tv saying the right wing are going to kill people they're going to blow stuff up they're going to
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.400]  shoot people they're going to attack federal buildings it's imminent and knowing the whole
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.280]  history of oklahoma city and the same crew that ran that is running things today the next car
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:48.480]  the only way they pull their bacon out of the fire on this it's all turned against them but
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:54.080]  i think they knew that though that was a no-brainer is the false flag and so i'm calling
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:10:01.120]  for extreme peace extreme discretion and no offensive violence obviously defend yourself
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:07.040]  if you're attacked and i just think we need to get that message out because they're even
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.920]  celebrating the transgender lady man that killed those kids now i've got a bunch of clips here so
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.400]  the left is beyond craze they're mad dog and i don't know how we thread the needle and protect
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.680]  ourselves save the republic and then deal with the fact that they're going to stage violence
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:27.520]  i mean that's obviously the next move i don't see what other move there could be to legitimize the
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.680]  further crackdown of this whole panopticonic system we see coming in roger stone of stone
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.360]  zone.com you're going to be also coming back during the fourth hour i'm told i appreciate
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.960]  that i have to be back in bankruptcy court today but things are going well there the chapter five
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.720]  trustees put a big report out that has a few criticisms but says i've been extremely
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.360]  transparent and we've been telling the truth and that what we saw on the news that i made 62
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:59.520]  million dollars last year is a total lie the profit was 62 million over like 14 years and most
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.080]  of it was paid to the irs and for him and for infrastructure so good things happening on that
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.800]  front i'm not gonna really get into that today but the the point is is that i have to leave
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.760]  to go get on you know the court virtually here at two you're going to be back then judge and
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.520]  apolitano is coming up roger stone i'm trying to give me the floor in the rest of this segment the
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:24.000]  next but what do you want to tackle first well alex so you i think that you uh pointed out a
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.880]  very good starting point which of course was election night uh in 2016 uh when we were together
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:38.960]  so what was a i think about it wistfully now um i was a bullion you were kind of downcast
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:45.680]  and i was surprised about that i remember we were together looking at early returns i looked at the
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.480]  returns from south florida and i said i don't know alex these margins out of the three most
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:56.080]  liberal counties i just don't know if trump can overcome this in the central and northern part
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:02.160]  of the state and then the rural areas came in with record turnouts florida turned to trump
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:09.200]  and within a few moments it became very clear that victory was ours um i was celebrating
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.520]  and you were rather downcast and i and i told you that i thought that trump would save the country
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.800]  save the republic uh and you were kind of well you know i don't know if he knows if what he's
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:26.320]  up against and of course he is it turns out he didn't know what he was up against that that is
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:32.240]  kind of the beauty of this moment which is to say he is poised to grab a second term as president
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.200]  uh he made some mistakes in his first term he did some really great things
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.880]  energy independence uh racking the courts with uh conservative appointments by the way roger i
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.880]  said i was going to give you the floor but he just left trump tower we're going to skip this break
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.080]  in fact we're going to skip the next two breaks we never do this but this is historic i'm sure
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.080]  the radio stations are skipping breaks as well they certainly should be this is historic i want
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:59.280]  you to talk about finish your point and talk about how this is historic as tv viewers see the footage
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.320]  of trump with the secret service in his motorcade i'm going to turn himself into the soros da please
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:11.200]  continue roger sure look this is a man walking right into the belly of the beast i spoke to him
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:17.120]  last night after uh i was on with tucker carlson i had a short bit in which i talked about the fact
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:24.400]  that if they put a gag order on him today which he is about to find out um it would not only be
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.600]  unconstitutional nowhere does it say if you're charged with a crime you lose your free speech
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:36.480]  rights but would also be obvious election interference he is a legal uh filed candidate
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:43.920]  for president of the united states uh but if there is a gag order today or within the next 48 hours
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:49.200]  it will really be a reflection of the fact that the deep state of which alvin bragg is just a
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:58.160]  minor appendage realize that this is backfiring very very badly on them uh and uh i expect that
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:04.640]  they will move to silence him because uh his handling of this has been masterful he is the
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:11.200]  single greatest counter-puncher in american political history and he's used even his
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:19.680]  diminished presence on social media to completely turn the tables on his and let's be clear say what
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.760]  you want he was really the president he was working for america made some mistakes he has
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.400]  eye swatter in his veins he looks better than me before he ran eight years ago he looks like i'll
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.600]  be i'm not kissing his ass it's true he looks like a superhero all of a sudden he looks so angry and
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:41.200]  powerful in the videos and photos i've seen a whole the the real donald trump and is like
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:46.880]  glowing basically he looks like he's lost 50 pounds uh he's just i've never seen this aura
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.200]  you've known him for 45 years are you seeing a new donald trump or is this the real donald trump
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.760]  because this is not mr friendly nice guy right now when i saw him get out of the car and walk
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.640]  into trump tower last night it was like i mean i mean let me just be honest i i've i mean you
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.840]  didn't see john wayne in movies resonate that amount of masculinity i'm not kissing his ass
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:11.280]  i mean you can see it what the hell's going on i think it's very very clear he understands that
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:18.240]  he has a rendezvous with destiny uh and that he was made for this moment his whole life has been
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:25.040]  brought to this moment the christian prophet kim clement said he would serve two terms uh he is on
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:32.640]  his way to do so this is sadly part of that process the deep state has miscalculated badly
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:38.320]  this is backfiring but it is galvanizing americans across the country including those americans in the
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.120]  middle who weren't quite sure whether he was the right man to lead the country over the next four
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:50.320]  years this is history in the making we are seeing it unfolding right before our very eyes donald
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:57.200]  trump is above all a warrior uh a fighter a man he will never bow and will never quit
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:06.160]  do you agree with me that he looks 15 years younger and i mean i'm being honest folks
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:13.440]  when i when i look at trump um he is really radiating power i mean i'll be honest
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:20.240]  well he's an individual of enormous self-confidence uh the the media types would
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.800]  keep calling me who know that we speak and while i'll never talk about the contents of our
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.760]  conversations they say well he's hysterical isn't he i mean he's scared isn't he i mean isn't he
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:35.280]  isn't he furious like throwing uh you know scotch tape to spent no that's not the trump that i that
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.080]  i'm talking to that's not the trump to see that's not the trump i will see this evening uh if
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:46.880]  anything he's serene he's extraordinarily calm in in the face of this the guy has a giant set
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:54.400]  of cojones i mean he is he really understands that this is his destiny is just part of the process is
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:17:01.040]  he angry in the sense that he he is upset with the with the injustice of all this yeah it's
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:07.040]  entirely unfair but then he's been intrigued treated unfairly and completely differently
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:13.120]  and held to a different standard than any political leader uh in our country's history
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.760]  uh and um he's probably if there is no mug shot my guess is he's probably going to be
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:22.400]  a little disappointed let's put that image up of him taking a telephoto lens as he walks in from
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:28.080]  target state you know we've all looked at trump a lot we know his face well that look is not
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:35.200]  putting on an act it's not even confidence it's determination and will that the the way i mean
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:41.680]  this is all i i study body language i'm good at it we all are but i'm particularly good that is
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.440]  absolute resolution i mean i would call that resolute right there yeah when his jaw is set
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:53.600]  like that you're absolutely right so um i think he understands that he actually wins this round
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:59.120]  and as i say if there is no mug shot i think he'll actually be be disappointed because he would
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.840]  have slapped it on a coffee mug and made another six million dollars by the way speak of the devil
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.680]  we learned they weren't into the mug shot this morning the shirts being made they're done in
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:13.680]  one week pre-order them now info war store.com it says political prisoner with trump info war
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.240]  store.com now available being made right here in austin texas they're going to start printing them
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:24.080]  today they'll be here in about a week so we have the first trump political prisoner shirts again
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.480]  guys check info war store.com i was told 15 minutes ago it was going up imminently at info

[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.520]  running for president the fun way to trigger libtards but get your president trump political
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.920]  prisoner mug shot it's not the real mug shot because they don't want to give us that image
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.600]  so we are basically made our own info war store.com rogers since you talk about this we're gonna
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.840]  some stations probably didn't skip the break a bunch of them did we're gonna rejoin stations
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.280]  in about a minute and 16 seconds and then i want to play your appearance with carlson last night
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:03.120]  have you continue but but what else is on your radar screen right now well this uh the leaks
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:09.360]  are really problematic and it shows you the real problem of a potential gag that story you just
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:16.080]  written uh you showed us was written by mike isakov uh now how do we know that there are 34
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:22.240]  counts in an indictment that has not yet been released uh in fact it is a class e felony in
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.840]  the state of new york uh for mr is a cough to have that document but i think people need to
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:34.960]  examine who exactly is a cough is because he's a deep state actor he's a rodent like individual
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:42.480]  he is the guy who pushed the steel dossier uh he got it from the fbi he wrote it for uh for yahoo
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:50.720]  and then they used his story in the fake fisa uh fisa warrant uh filing to spy on donald trump's
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:57.040]  campaign so this is the problem with the gag order they leak everything uh with impunity
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.840]  while you of course are not allowed to publicly defend yourself all right roger we're going to
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:06.560]  rejoin stations in seven seconds i'll make that announcement most stations did skip the break but
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:16.560]  here we go and welcome back to live continual coverage of trump his motorcade is driving
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.640]  towards the manhattan courthouse where he'll be turning himself in he will not be mugshotted
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.360]  or handcuffed or supposedly put in jail because they don't want the the public to see that
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:31.120]  archetypal image they know that this has backfired on them roger stone is here with us we'll go live
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:36.400]  as we are now to the scene with audio uh as soon as his motorcade arrives here in just a few
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.000]  minutes if you just join us roger stone brought up a very key point and trump's new lead lawyer
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.280]  brought this up we'll have a clip in a moment where he said it is a serious felony to leak info
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:50.320]  and the new york times izakoff says he was leaked the info so it's real easy you you you go and you
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:56.960]  talk to him and then because because this is not like a journalist and their sources this is in a
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:03.360]  court case there is a law in the state and they have leaked someone else's private information
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.360]  before they've even had a chance their lawyers have seen it that's why there's a law because
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:11.600]  they're trying the case before trump can even see it and respond so this is not an issue of
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.640]  journalism it's an issue of like hippa leaking someone's private information so let's actually
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:23.280]  play that clip first and then roger uh can respond this is a clip 25 trump attorney uh
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:32.240]  elena haba tells cnn that bragg's office leaked a number of uh counts against trump the press
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:37.360]  information the trump legal team doesn't have and that's a felony here it is former president and do
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:42.080]  you do the legal team uh do they the unsealing of the document do you support that does he support
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:49.120]  that yes i mean i think it will happen no matter what i would like to see what the basis is for
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:54.320]  this let's remember that the real crime here that we have is that da brad did leak that there were
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:59.680]  30 to 34 counts we already know that that in itself is a felony you are not to let that go
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.760]  so at this point i mean and and i like everybody we don't know if the same no matter we don't know
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.080]  if the da leaked that information that is speculation well we don't have that information
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:18.080]  so well it's not speculation we don't have the information so it came from their office roger
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.280]  stone responding to that here he is letting crime run rampant i'm sure you heard a parking attendant
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.080]  caught a guy breaking in cars the guy turned and shot him he took the gun away and shot him
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:34.720]  they're charging the guy that that barely saved his life i mean these people are lunatics yeah
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:40.480]  let's go through that because i think it's important uh either this information was leaked
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:46.480]  by someone in district attorney bragg's office uh or a single member of the grand jury which is
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:53.360]  highly unlikely because the grand jury uh wouldn't know what conclusions the prosecutors had reached
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:23:00.960]  so again let's put his picture up here mike isekoff deep state actor the exact same fbi
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:09.040]  shill that they gave the phony steel dossier to then he wrote the story about the dossier as if
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.960]  it were real for yahoo then the department of justice took his story which they had planted
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:22.720]  and presented it to the FISA court as evidence to justify the spying on donald trump's campaign
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:29.680]  so they return they always return to the scene of the crime mike isekoff isn't a journalist
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:37.120]  uh he is a is a rat-like creature who is an fbi show he's a deep state actor i mean
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:42.720]  absolutely roger trump is arriving here in just a minute or two let's go to this live feed with audio
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.400]  a circus-like atmosphere thousands and thousands of people there
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.280]  the new york mayor has been threatening mtg and others acting like they're violent saying don't
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:06.560]  be violent total defamation president trump's about to get out of his armored suv
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:20.880]  this is a disgrace upon disgraces
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.880]  so
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:38.400]  roger president trump is just now going inside
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.880]  go back to the ground shot
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.560]  roger you were uh trying to top the head you muted what were you saying
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:56.480]  uh you know it's amazing alex even in deep blue new york the new york young republican club
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:03.040]  turned out literally thousands of people lining the entire block outside the courthouse as close
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:11.280]  as they could get to these proceedings at the same time mayor eric adams uh is telling trump
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:16.720]  supporters uh including uh marjorie taylor green who went there for a peaceful protest
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:22.640]  to behave with all due respect mr mayor tell your friends in black lives matter to behave
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.560]  tell your friends in antifa to behave take a look at the crime statistics for new york city
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:34.240]  that were released yesterday every single category of crime including violent crime
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:39.200]  up dramatically under the failed leadership absolutely absolutely there's trump right there
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:49.760]  waving to the crowd and he is now going into the courthouse this is just unbelievable
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:57.040]  with all the crimes biden's committed obama the clintons uh the the soros the democrats hunter
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:04.320]  biden ten percent for the big guy and uh there goes trump into the courthouse wow roger please
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.920]  continue you're making great points but i cut you off not at all uh look i think the president
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:18.160]  is extraordinarily resolute uh and as you know he will leave new york flying uh back to uh to
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.760]  palm beach now what's going to be very interesting is obviously he has prepared remarks for tonight
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:30.480]  but alex those remarks may have to be completely recalibrated because we don't know uh if the judge
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:38.240]  is going to issue a broad or even a narrow gag order on the president i'm fairly confident that
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:44.480]  if there is a gag order on him uh his lawyers will appeal the constitutionality of that the
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:50.560]  legality of that but that appeal could never be heard today so uh what the president may be
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:58.160]  limited to a a more muted response tonight unless of course he decides to uh ignore said
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:04.480]  gag order based on its unconstitutionality i doubt his lawyers would let well i mean as you said
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:09.840]  as you said in videos you've been putting out this is major election meddling to tell the
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.960]  frontrunner much less any candidate they can't talk is preposterous while all his enemies will
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:21.680]  be lying about him 24 7 well and and while they're while they're leaking against jimmy that's really
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:27.600]  the process when i was under a gag order i would wake up in the morning and cnn would be reporting
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.480]  that uh robert muller has roger stone's tax records for the last 10 years and all of his
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:39.760]  banking records how could they possibly know that so it's not just the gag it's while you are gagged
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:46.080]  malicious actors like alvin bragg and the people that work for him are leaking just as they leaked
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:52.000]  the existence of this indictment to the new york times last friday just uh like they leaked the
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:59.120]  fact that there are 34 counts in the indictment uh to to the criminal rodent uh michael isikoff
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:04.320]  the propagandist for the deep state uh who immediately rushed it to prim that's the donald
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.920]  trump i know and love right there defiant that that look is defiance roger you were making a
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.520]  key point 10 minutes ago before we had to cut to the live breaking news of trump quote turning

[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.720]  a demonized version of alex jones to do that this is happening this is not like the other probes
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.040]  before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking you would adapt to

[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:46.000]  destruction because i brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out as much as
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.640]  i can they want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:58.480]  where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what i've said being sincere
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.440]  built me into an insincere person in the straw man i'm personally cares about life and children
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:07.600]  and is against these wars and so they make me a murderer of children and then they build me into
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:12.960]  this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:19.360]  about alex jones so even if i didn't sell out to them they now use me as an archetype to serve
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.080]  by being the main distraction i have now been captured by the enemy

[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:32.800]  over the top dangerous historic to indict a front-runner in a political campaign
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:39.440]  much less a former president who everybody knows they stole the election from
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.520]  is just over the top insane
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:51.840]  25 to 30 point increase since this started the numbers show it's only going up now he may be 35
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:59.440]  by tonight above everybody else fundraising tens of millions a day breaking all records
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:07.200]  and statute of limitations is up allen dershowitz says it is the it is the weakest case he's ever
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:16.080]  seen on the show friday and they still did it roger stone i go back to what we talked
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:22.720]  about 20 minutes ago 25 minutes ago when you first came on i only see them being successful
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:26.800]  here if they staged terror attacks or mass shootings or things along those lines and blame
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:34.000]  us and i said that last week i said it last friday and then now we've got the usual suspects
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.560]  peter schrock and others running around like chickens with their heads cut off saying
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:43.600]  the right wing is calling for violence and we're gonna get violent when when 99 percent of us are
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.360]  saying let's not be violent and we're not the ones burning down cities you kind of got into
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.720]  that with black lives matter earlier and you have the mayor saying you don't be violent you
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:55.520]  republicans when they're the ones that let the criminals run wild and bail out arsonists and all
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:01.120]  the rest of it like the vice president does it i mean they're they're telegraphing and and
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:07.120]  manipulating the mind space and i think i don't think i know telegraphing what their next move's
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:13.280]  going to be can you elaborate on how this has gone for them and and other ways you think
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:19.360]  they could somehow extricate themselves from what they've done well alex i have to be honest with
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:25.200]  you well i don't rule out what you say is true that they may stage some kind of false flag or
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.040]  seek to goad somebody into an act of violence that they could then blame on donald trump uh
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:36.080]  and his supporters i think what is far more likely is what we're seeing here is just the first step
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:43.440]  in a plan of lawfare we know all about this don't we so everything you see going down today this
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:50.560]  will all be duplicated in fulton county georgia in a matter of weeks uh the the so much focus
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.280]  on what's happened in new york very little focus on the fact that special counsel
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:02.640]  jack smith uh hauled several secret service agents in front of the grand jury to testify regarding
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:08.240]  matters pertaining to president trump's uh handling of federal documents so let's be very
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:15.920]  clear this is this is going on today fulton county georgia equally bogus as an indictment
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:20.800]  for anybody who will bother to read the entire transcript of the conversation between
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:26.240]  trump and the secretary of state raffensperger trump does not direct him to go magically find
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:32.880]  11 votes that's 11 000 plus votes that's a fabrication but uh they have every intention i
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:38.480]  believe but biden himself blurted this out we're not going to let him take power we're going to use
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:44.320]  the constitution that was the hint that their intention within the confines of the january 6
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.800]  investigation is to try to somehow fabricated charge of sedition against the president under
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:56.160]  the 14th amendment and that is the only circumstance under which he would not be
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:03.680]  legally eligible to run if he's charged with a crime a state or federal crime but has not yet
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:09.200]  come to trial that does not negate his ability to be the republican nominee it does not negate
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:16.960]  his ability uh to campaign depending on the terms of his probation of course uh and it doesn't uh
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:22.800]  stop him from being sworn in as president only a conviction and only a conviction on that one
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:29.520]  crime a crime of of essentially uh conspiracy against the united states under the 14th amendment
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:36.080]  um would stop him from being president and alex that is precisely what they have planned old man
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:41.520]  biden blurted it out the other day that is the player that's right in fact there's a bunch of
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:48.720]  clips of him saying this here is biden in september of last year so i guess that's about uh five six
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:53.600]  months ago here here he is saying exactly what they've now done just like when he bragged about
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.280]  blowing up or the plan to blow up the north stream to pipeline g7 conversation was tied to your
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:05.760]  predecessor who is about to launch another campaign so how do you reassure them if that is
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:12.000]  the reason for their questioning that the former president will not return that his political
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.160]  movement which is still very strong uh will now once again take power in the united states well
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:26.960]  um we just have to demonstrate that he will not take power um by uh if we if he does run
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:34.240]  making sure he uh under legitimate efforts of uh our constitution does not become the next president
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:45.040]  again um okay so let's let's unpack that go ahead there it is i mean look they they know they can't
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:52.560]  beat him in an honest fair transparent uh election uh and therefore they have to derail his candidacy
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.160]  what you're seeing today is just the first step or i should say the next step in their efforts
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:05.200]  to derail his candidacy far more lethal than these pissant state charges which are completely
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:14.080]  contrived would be some federal indictment by a powerful uh special counsel who does not leak by
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:20.800]  the way it's very interesting unlike muller who was let's face it a senile buffoon and whose
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:27.600]  actual investigation was being run by the epically corrupt uh uh uh andrew weisman uh
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.320]  this investigation doesn't leak but there you have it joe biden just blurted it out they have
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:41.440]  to somehow disqualify trump there's only one way to do that short of course of killing him and i
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:48.400]  pray to god for his safety every single day the safety of both the president and his family uh
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.280]  by the way let's elaborate on that when you and i talked about they could assassinate him because
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.720]  they hate him so much that's a no-brainer that's why he has a secret service that's why world
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:02.000]  leaders have have security entourages but the media is like oh they're crazy they say somebody
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.200]  might kill him while they're constantly calling for somebody to kill him if he beats these cases
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:12.240]  or he's going to win the election i really think they're going to try to assassinate trump i mean
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:18.240]  that that's just part of history that's what goes on well they killed one american president that
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:22.800]  we know of john f kennedy i wrote a new york times best-selling book on it it was the occasion
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:29.600]  that you and i first met on the anniversary of his death uh so it is not beyond them it was
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.440]  amazing alex people do raise this with me all the time and the people who do raise it as a concern
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:42.320]  are most always overwhelmingly pastors i don't know why that is but many many pastors priests
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:47.840]  rabbis and others raise the question with me of the president's personal safety and their prayers
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:53.920]  for him no i don't think it's outside the realm of possibility if you understand the context of
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:59.680]  american history john kennedy was murdered because he was about to take down the deep state he said
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:05.440]  he would smash the cia into a million pieces and scatter it to the wind weeks later he was dead
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:10.880]  richard nixon was planning a complete reorganization of the government and was
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.920]  preparing to take power from the intelligence agencies in the national security apparatus
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:22.240]  it is memorialized in his biography that's why they took him down after winning a landslide
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:29.360]  second term in a silent coup known as watergate now they know because he's written he's drawn this
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:35.600]  line in the sand on march 16th he made it very clear he will completely reorganize the government
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:41.520]  and he will take power away from the national security apparatus the intelligence agencies
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:47.600]  and the deep state and replace those people with america first advocates this is a declaration of
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:54.480]  war and therefore no tactic is beyond them uh the the this lawfare that we see today this abuse of
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:01.200]  the judicial process that we see today uh the false flag attacks which say we blame patriots
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:07.920]  this is why it is essential peaceful and legal peaceful and legal if you're angry today uh if
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:15.680]  you're upset today uh if you choose to protest in any public way keep it peaceful and legal because
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:21.680]  they would like to blame violence on us eric adams we're not that stupid it's your allies who
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.640]  are violent and again all our listeners know that conservatives are historically the most low crime
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.360]  level non-violent people out there we know that the fact is they're trying to tell the public
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:36.800]  we're about to be violent which is again telegraphing what their next big move is going to be let's
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:43.120]  come back with roger stone and talk about the censorship grid and what's happening with this
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:49.120]  legislation that's very close to passing the restrict act and how it is the jewel in the crown

[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:19.840]  we are hurtling into the year 2024 and the election trump would win hands down by any
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:25.200]  poll he's 10 to 15 points ahead of biden 30 points ahead of the santas they're trying to
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:31.120]  take him out but roger you have hammered this and hammered this and you said before he got indicted
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.800]  he believed he was still being indicted and very soon and three days later the news came out that
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:42.560]  indeed that was going to happen i love how when they first told his lawyers hey get ready next
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.120]  tuesday we're going to do this and he said look this is terney they went oh you're crazy you made
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:54.240]  it up but now we all see how real it was they just lie at every angle even when the truth
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:00.240]  would serve them better but you've hammered the point but they also did this out of desperation
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:05.760]  about all the bad things about them in the news and the bidens and the chinese and the russian
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:14.000]  money and all the rest of it and you've also hammered over and over again the issue of if we
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.400]  don't have a voice in america these tyrants will win and despite all their suppression of trump
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.320]  he's gotten stronger not weaker when he's representation of the populous rebellion
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:30.560]  though an imperfect vessel we all are so i want to play a few minute clip of matt tahibi who's
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:37.120]  had a chance to read the restrict act it's very close to passing that's 20 years in jail for
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:43.520]  disinformation 20 years in jail for using a vpn uh it takes all the legal surveillance and
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:48.400]  censorship they've been doing and codifies it into law with these democrat think tanks
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:52.800]  through the intelligence agencies the justice department coming after the american people so
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:58.720]  they're really trying to cement all the evil stuff they've already done and expand it in the future
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:04.960]  can you speak to that yeah communications is the single most important thing to us if we cannot
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:11.440]  talk to our to our supporters and to everybody else we cannot possibly galvanize the people
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:18.080]  to take appropriate political action we can't have free fair and honest elections we've seen
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:24.320]  unprecedented censorship you and i alex and so many of our friends like uh lower lumer for
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:32.560]  example have been victims of this it is really shocking the courage of elon musk that he has
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.080]  pulled away the veil matt tahibi has been particularly effective in terms of demonstrating
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:45.760]  how the government abused its power in terms of that particular social media app but the idea that
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:53.040]  we're now sending a young man to jail for 10 years because he created a meme that was offensive to
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.840]  hillary clinton tells you what a slippery slope this is they cannot stand the truth they have to
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:08.400]  silence you to win because they can't win a debate of ideas they can't win in a in a level playing
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:15.120]  field of communications and this is the giant disadvantage that we are at this particular piece
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:23.040]  of legislation this is george orwell this is this is 1984 this is this is the most dangerous thing
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:29.840]  i've seen if this becomes the law of the land and it is very brutally enforced it really is
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:35.520]  over for america communications are the key to everything i want to play a couple minutes from
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.920]  tahini we'll come back and give it some other subjects but here it is you know we found a
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:46.960]  whole bunch of communications just recently about um in preparation for uh a hubbub they were all
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:54.160]  having at the aspen institute in 2021 where they were discussing um ideas like the restrict act
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:59.520]  which is being proposed for you know in response to tick tock there's i guess the european digital
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:05.360]  services act or whatever they call it um that's that they're thinking about for the eu um all
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:10.640]  the ideas in both of these bills um are sort of wish lists that have been passed around in
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:16.320]  this community for a long time the governments want absolute full and complete access to all
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:23.280]  data uh that these platforms provide and then they want a couple of other things that are really
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:29.520]  important they want um they want to have the authority to come in and moderate uh or at least
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:35.440]  be part of the process of moderation um and they also want to for people who are called like
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:41.840]  trusted flaggers uh that's how it's described in the european law they want those folks to have
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:47.440]  access to these platforms as well and that what they mean by that are these that are outside
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:55.360]  quasi-governmental agencies who tell these platforms what they can and cannot print about
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:00.320]  things like vaccine safety right um and then we found out more about that where they're where
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:06.640]  they're openly talking about censoring true information uh so yeah we're still finding out
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:12.000]  a lot of stuff about this and i think there is more to find unfortunately uh which is which is
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:18.640]  kind of disturbing to that they have people they call trusted partners uh who determine for them
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:24.560]  who are allowed to make determinations about content um or whose whose determinations they
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:33.280]  will take seriously so yeah i mean this is all the it's straight out of 1984 all this um if you
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:39.760]  look at the digital services act it's a lot like the recommendations of the aspen institute and
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.880]  it's got a lot in common with the restrict act here in the states when you look at the sections
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:53.680]  about uh giving the government access to data um what they really mean by that is they they want
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:01.280]  um everything any every kind of content that's created on the platform has to be done in a format
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:07.440]  that can be algorithmically searched so even video or if you have like you know something
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:13.440]  a conversational platform they have to be able to automatically generate a transcript quickly
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:20.240]  so that whatever ai they're attaching uh to surveil and monitor people um has to be able
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.680]  to look out for keywords quickly uh and it's funny we we did a thing about this thing called
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:30.400]  the morality project and they were upset uh one of the things they were upset about when they were
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:35.840]  reviewing covid information was that a worldwide freedom rally that was held last year i think or
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:41.840]  two years ago in europe had been organized on telegram where they couldn't search it where they
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:47.280]  didn't know it was coming and so like that's part of their thinking they we don't want any more of
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:51.840]  those spaces where we can't search we want everything searchable we want it instantly
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:58.240]  searchable this is a desperate ruling class that's totally corrupt and bankrupt morally trying to
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:02.720]  maintain control but no matter what they do evidenced by trump it doesn't work so they double
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:08.960]  down where do you see all this going rogerstone uh again i think you're going to see the continuation
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:15.840]  of lawfare against the president uh you're going to see a continued effort to control all the news
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:23.200]  see that is the real danger of this uh of the speculated gag order is while you are gagged
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:30.800]  they can without any uh consequences whatsoever they can leak all of this information to their
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:39.360]  allies in the fake news media and the jackals at cbs and nbc and cnn msnbc and new york times
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:45.360]  washington post wall street journal and so on they just run with a completely fraudulent narrative
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:51.520]  that is the story of the russian collusion hoax which gripped this country for three years there
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.240]  was a time that a majority of americans believe the russians had actually interfered in our
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:01.440]  election we now know definitively that that's absolutely false and they try to say oh well they
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:07.680]  did it on social media through bot farms we even know that that's false there was no uh there was
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:15.200]  no coordinated or effective russian interference uh in our 2016 election but yesterday hillary
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:21.040]  clinton is out yet again spinning the same fake narrative over and over again that's the thing
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:27.360]  about the left it doesn't matter how discredited or debunked any of their narratives get they will
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.640]  always return to them as if no one has ever raised the question i'll give you an example
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:39.680]  covet 19 vaccination alex absolutely effective and perfectly safe they're just ignoring the mountain
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:46.000]  of information now that disproves that as if we haven't heard it as if it's not true they always
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.800]  return to their same fake narrative and they double down and when you have a near monopoly
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:58.640]  on the output of information as they have had uh until recently uh it makes it a lot easier
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:06.400]  roger stone i've got judge andrew napolitano coming on next hour you're going to pop in and

[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:10.160]  so
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:25.600]  after being suppressed for almost a year by the u.s department of health and human services
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:31.600]  a new report has been released which uses dozens of studies to prove that fluoride consumption
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:38.080]  lowers the iq of children internal emails show that the report was blocked by the transgender
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:45.120]  assistant health secretary rachel levine and concealed from public since may of 2022
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:51.920]  as reported by capital in maine on march 14th in an article titled health officials delayed
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:59.120]  report linking fluoride to brain harm quote last may the national toxicology program was set to
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:04.880]  release its eagerly awaited report into the cognitive and neurodevelopmental impacts on
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:11.360]  humans from fluoride exposure it was to review studies which link fluoridated water to cognitive
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:18.800]  harm in children but quote before the ntp could release the report they were blocked said linda
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:26.160]  burn bomb ntp director until 2019 apparently the u.s department of health and human services hid
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:32.240]  the report after criticism from organizations that advocate water fluoridation such as the
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:39.360]  american dental association who casted doubt on the report in february of 2022 the american dental
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:46.880]  association emailed rachel levine and others asking the ntp to exclude or carefully consider
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:52.960]  how to characterize any lingering neurotoxin claims from the report because it might quote
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:59.920]  undermine national state and local efforts to expand community water fluoridation well that's
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:07.280]  the whole point in reviewing if fluoride could be a neurotoxin to avoid more harm to people especially
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:13.440]  children through water fluoridation let alone expand the practice a practice which most of the
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:18.800]  world rejects and many countries have even outlawed it especially in europe so after a
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:24.720]  subpoena forced the ntp to release the report it was quietly published for the public to view
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:31.040]  in the report's overall findings they concluded quote the data support and inverse association
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:38.000]  between fluoride exposure and children's iq they even put it more simply stating quote evaluated
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:45.120]  iq in children provide consistent evidence that higher fluoride exposure is associated with lower
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:52.560]  iq scores even adding that quote subtle shifts in iq at the population level have a profound
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:03:01.440]  impact however even though 52 of 55 studies found decreases in child iq with increased fluoride the
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:08.400]  national toxicology program says they have found quote no obvious threshold for total fluoride
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:16.240]  exposure or water fluoride exposure just like with covid it's a tale of two sciences so why does the
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:22.880]  u.s government fluoridate our water what science is there to back up the fact that 73 of people
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:28.320]  connected with community water systems receive fluoridated water just over two-thirds of the
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:34.960]  u.s population it's important to point out that fluoride is a term generally used to refer to a
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:41.280]  variety of chemical compounds made from fluorine these chemical compounds are the toxic waste
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:48.400]  product from various industries such as nuclear weapons manufacturing aluminum production and the
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:55.600]  mining of minerals used in fertilizers because the proper disposal of such toxic waste is expensive
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:01.120]  these industries have found a way to make their waste product profitable by selling it off as a
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:07.600]  helpful agent of dental hygiene however these compounds are toxic to the human body to our
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:13.520]  bones our hormones in our minds to learn more about the history of fluoridated water read
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:20.880]  christopher bryson's book the fluoride deception or watch the documentary fluoride poison on tap

[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:32.960]  documentary features edward group mike adams and various scientists and health experts who break
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:38.880]  down the entire fluoride hoax that's been perpetrated on the american people also remember

[02:05:53.760 --> 02:06:11.200]  national television that he was going to win at infowarsstore.com crashing through the lies and
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:18.000]  disinformation it's alex jones
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:32.320]  we are now into hour number three we have a really informative guest couldn't be a more perfect time
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:38.880]  to have him on judge andrew de palatano host of his own very popular tv show and podcast
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:44.560]  obviously former top legal contributor at fox news judge andrew de palatano teaches
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:48.320]  constitutional law he's been a judge i'm not going to go over all his awards and background
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:54.080]  everybody knows who he is judgenap.com podcast judging freedom available on youtube judge andrew
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:07:01.840]  de palatano here at this historic moment there's footage about an hour ago of trump turning himself
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:08.960]  in and then we also have the live camera shot of when he's reportedly going to be coming out soon
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:15.360]  he's quote being processed never before done in america why do we not let local prosecutors
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.760]  indict former or current presidents well you see it happen in third world countries all the time
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:26.160]  you know why major constitutional crisis and then you've got the da clearly needs to be investigated
[02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:31.840]  for committing a felony leaking the 34 count indictment to the new york times that's not
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:37.520]  journalistic rights and sources because that's trump's personal data that his lawyers deserve
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:43.600]  to get at the same time as everybody else that's why they have felony laws in new york now judge
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:49.680]  de palatano has been a judge in new york and a judge in other places so he can he can definitely
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:55.040]  uh correct me if i'm wrong uh but we're just really seeing an orgy of tyranny here a real
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:08:01.040]  miscalculation trump's up 30 points against asanas right now he'd beat biden right now
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:05.280]  it was an election about 15 points the polls show judge andrew de palatano thank you so much for
[02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:12.080]  joining us wow what a time to be alive well it's a pleasure to be with you alex no matter what we're
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:19.440]  talking about i'm dying to read the indictment to see if it's claptrap to see if it's a gross
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:25.440]  exaggerations or to see if there's a there there i didn't know about the leak of actually all
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:29.920]  morning and in the early part of the afternoon it's two o'clock here on the east coast i've been
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:36.560]  trying to get a copy of this myself my fervent hope was to be able to evaluate the indictment
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:42.800]  for you and my intrepid producer is pulling all the strings he can to try no no it's not out yet
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:51.600]  only only the new york times gets to see it yeah well um whoever has it has reported that there's
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:58.160]  34 counts in there that means 34 different felonies that means one of two things either
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:04.960]  they have charged him with matters in addition to the stormy daniels uh other felonies that we don't
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:11.520]  know about it may be the so-called catch and kill which i can explain in a minute or every time
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:18.400]  donald trump reimbursed michael cohen for the dormie staniels payment cohen paid her 130 000
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:27.120]  trump reimbursed him uh in 13 10 000 checks and then the trump organization reimbursed trump
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:34.960]  in 13 10 000 checks or wires there's your 26 transactions there we're almost up to 34
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:44.720]  the catch and kill actually sounds sexier than it is uh trump uh would go to um the uh national
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:49.680]  inquirer and say there's a lady out there claiming uh i slept with her i didn't but i really don't
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:56.400]  need the pr can you buy her story and then kill it so the national inquirer would approach her
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:00.480]  pay her a hundred thousand dollars for the story interviewer write up the story she'd approve the
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:04.640]  story and then they'd say we're going to kill the story and then trump would reimburse the national
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:12.800]  inquirer 100 000 that is arguably fraud on the lady um because she signed an agreement saying
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:17.040]  she can't discuss this with anybody except the reporter from the national inquirer listen i
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:22.240]  don't know if this stuff is in there uh women have been claiming to have sex with him you know for
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:29.760]  years i don't know if their claims are true um he uh is confronting a lot more serious legal issues
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:34.640]  than this but this is uh this is the first one to come down the pike i agree with you
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:38.880]  now i i come on your show to talk about the law and the constitution but politically
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:45.840]  that's the a that's the prosecutor himself that's the da uh that we just saw that was alvin that's
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:52.320]  right for tv viewers uh the soros creature alvin bragg just just just came out of the court office
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:11:01.600]  go ahead yeah he uh left his office to go up to the courtroom uh which is where the actual
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:05.760]  arraignment will take place now i normally don't opine on political matters but just
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:12.400]  as sort of a political junkie i worked at fox for 24 years uh it would seem to me that this will
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:19.040]  seriously embolden trump's base this might scare away some of the more skittish voters but the base
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:24.960]  in the republican party as you pointed out is decidedly uh moving to trump and quite frankly
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:28.800]  i'm nothing against ron de santis i know him and i like him i don't agree with him on a lot of
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:33.440]  things but i like him i don't think he knows how to handle this i don't know if chris christie's
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:38.720]  going to enter the race the others that were in the race uh in my view don't stand a chance of
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:45.120]  laying a glove on trump that's former governor asa hutchinson of arkansas former uh governor
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:52.080]  um so that's my question to you a really smart political person on this illegal great legal mind
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:56.800]  why would the establishment with all the stuff the bidens have done all the other
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:03.520]  things the clintons have done go after trump on things like this knowing it would embolden him
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:12.320]  the establishment wants trump to be the republican nominee joe biden wants trump to be the republican
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:17.920]  nominee many republicans fear trump being the republican nominee not because they don't want
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:24.880]  him as president they do but because they believe that if trump is the nominee joe will not have to
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:31.680]  defend his utterly indefensible deplorable record as president the united states because the issue
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:36.160]  won't be joe's presidency it'll be trump's character personality and alleged crimes
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.360]  so they're using i said that last week they're doing the indictment as a smokescreen
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.360]  because they just like hillary wanted trump she thought she could beat him but but but but she
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:49.520]  pushed him to push him up front because she thought she could beat him now they're doing
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:56.400]  the same mistake again right so this is not the strongest case against him he's going to be on
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:03.200]  trial for rape in new york city in three weeks not criminal rape civil rape this lady alleged
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:07.760]  that he raped her in a dressing room in bird dwarf goodman a high-end doesn't exist anymore
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:14.000]  high-end department store in new york 15 years ago the state of new york in its infinite wisdom
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.360]  has opened up the statute of limitations for adult survivors of sexual assault and this lady
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:24.400]  sued him the case is going to federal court he's going to testify just a few blocks from where he
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:30.320]  is now then there's the atlanta georgia case then there's the two federal cases there's mar-a-lago
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:36.560]  and then there's january 6th these cases are far more serious than this one but the establishment
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:43.520]  believes that by ganging up on him this way it will generate support for him he will knock off
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:52.640]  christy de santis hutchison haley or france uh runs uh and he'll be the nominee and joe can win
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:59.920]  then joe will resign and whoever the veep is will become president now who do you think that veep
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:09.680]  will be well i mean uh who do you think this is clinton mrs clinton you heard it here first this
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:18.160]  is part of their scam if you see her uh being mentioned as his as joe's new uh beep i don't
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:22.000]  know what they'll do with kamala harris give her some federal judgeship or something then you'll
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.480]  know that she and her husband are behind this scam you heard it here well you made a lot of
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:31.120]  predictions that have come true so you're saying is that your own political analysis are you
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:37.920]  getting this from your sources well i'm getting this from uh democrats candidly who can't stand
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:45.200]  her uh but believe that she's orchestrating this so i don't know i mean right back
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:52.880]  nancy pelosi in a bizarre video we have it called her mrs president miss president yesterday and
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:57.680]  said the russians stole the election so it does seem like she suddenly resurfaced for this
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:04.320]  you know she's been off the wall lately she said that i don't know we're going to listen to this
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:11.520]  no no i would just put the b-roll okay let me guess she said trump has to prove is that
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:17.040]  prove prove his innocence well that is insane you know you would flunk a high school social
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.440]  studies course if you say the uh defendant has to prove his innocence we all know that
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:27.360]  donald trump is innocent all defendants are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:33.280]  doubt and to a moral certainty look trump has a very interesting defense in this case stay there
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:38.880]  judge we gotta go to break and i'll actually play the clip of pelosi and hillary and pelosi calling
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:42.240]  uh hillary the president and then you can get into trump's interesting defense couldn't have
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:48.080]  a better guest on today we're also got that live feed up there when trump comes out we saw brag

[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:05.040]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:23.520]  and we are back with judge andrew depolitano could not have a better legal mind on with us today with
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:29.840]  what's happening judge you got cut off by that hard break the satellite feeds the radio tv
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:34.880]  stations you were getting into a very interesting defense that trump has that nobody's talked about
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:42.320]  yet well even if thank you alex even if everything that the government says trump did he did do
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:52.400]  that is he used corporate funds uh to pay for a campaign expense if it was not a campaign expense
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:59.040]  if it was to save his marriage from the embarrassment of what stormy daniels would say
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:05.120]  rather than his campaign then it is perfectly legal now if he gets on the witness stand and
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.520]  says i did this to save the marriage so milania wouldn't throw me out i don't know how the
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:15.360]  government could possibly uh counter that so that is a very strong defense that he has because they
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:21.680]  have to show the government has to show intent and intent to defraud the government because
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:27.120]  the corporate funds are non-taxable they're ordinary corporate expenses if it comes out of
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:33.120]  his pocket then he's got to pay income tax on it either way if it was to save the marriage
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:41.600]  it's lawful wow and look inside baseball remember the new york post shots of milania in that
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:46.880]  gorgeous i mean i'll be honest you know lesbian soft porn scene uh you know that other European
[02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:53.200]  woman um that was leaked by trump because he thought the base would like that he's never said
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:59.760]  he was a choir boy or any of that uh and so i always wondered why he would make a payoff
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:06.240]  to her uh when when he knows his base you know christian conservatives don't like it if you say
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:12.640]  you're you're this you know eunuch basically and then you're something else but if you've never
[02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:16.480]  hidden it and you agree with their ideas of politics i found they're very forgiving they're
[02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:21.440]  not hypocrites the average christian that i mean they like what trump does but but they get it
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:23.920]  i mean i don't know why the hell he would make a payment to her
[02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:31.760]  uh you know i don't know that and and unfortunately that type of argument goes
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:39.040]  more toward this is political rather than uh familial uh if you look at the time frame alex
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:46.160]  this payment to stormy daniels was two weeks after the big brouhaha over the access hollywood tapes
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:53.520]  which caused some republicans to flee from trump you know that was his hot mic off the record
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:23:00.560]  didn't know he was speaking boasting about his sexual conquests i think that paul manifold and
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:05.920]  steve bannon and the folks advising his campaign at the time said you know we can deal with one
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:10.000]  of these we can't deal with two you got to pay off this crazy lady by the way donald we never
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:15.040]  heard of her is it true that's not true they don't care if it's true or not they just cared about
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:21.120]  paying her off and michael cohen came up with this scheme uh to pay her off here's a another
[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:28.560]  defensive trump had reimbursed cohen out of trump's own money and then not taken reimbursement from
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:37.840]  the corporation no crime the only crime is the use of corporate or non-taxable funds to
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:44.560]  pay a campaign debt as if the campaign debt were an ordinary reasonable uh corporate years
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:50.960]  shifting gears what about selective enforcement i mean i'm not a famous judge like you and a
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:55.600]  university scholar but to me this is selective enforcement if you've got the clintons and the
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:24:00.960]  obamas and the biden is just running around like people swinging off the chandeliers they're so
[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:06.800]  corrupt and bragging about their corruption and then they're going after trump over a a high-end
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:11.680]  hooker that that i think that's what the polls are up it just doesn't sit well that that even
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:17.520]  if this is true it just doesn't it doesn't compare to the other stuff well that that is
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:24.080]  an argument for the jury if the judge uh lets them make it normally judges won't let you make
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:30.240]  that argument uh to the jury because that's a form of jury nullification now you and i believe
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:36.480]  in jury nullification it is the law of the lands judges hate it because it requires the judge to
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:42.160]  say if you believe the defendant is guilty but should not have been charged for public policy
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:48.080]  reasons then you may find him not guilty that is the law of the land they can do that but judges
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:54.960]  uh will never tell them that selective prosecution unfortunately for trump has to be for the same
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:25:02.320]  crime i agree with you there is the public view and it's well grounded that joe biden uh received
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:08.960]  funds illegally from people in ukraine through circuitous routes involving his family members
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:14.560]  uh that bill and hillary did the same not with respect to uh ukraine uh that hillary is pretty
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:22.160]  much boasted uh about her uh failure to safeguard state secrets so the only crime that the court
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:27.200]  would look at to determine if a selective prosecution is the exact same crime which is
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:35.280]  uh false bookkeeping intended to hide or mask a a campaign contribution as if it were a corporate
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:41.040]  expense they would not look at other things that biden and the clintons did because they're
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:47.200]  different crimes what does this do in general why do they call this a constitutional crisis
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:52.400]  why do we even have bill bar coming out saying this is preposterous and super dangerous
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:56.800]  um you know other well-known top lawyers alan dershowitz says he's never seen anything like
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:01.840]  this i mean pretty much across the board even the feds didn't decide to charge trump for this
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:05.760]  uh why why do you think they didn't but but now bragg has made the leap
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:15.760]  all right it's an odd situation so um the feds charged michael cohen and michael cohen testified
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:23.360]  against himself in a courtroom about all of this the trial wasn't a jury it was just a guilty plea
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:27.920]  but in federal court you take an oath you go on the witness stand you testify what did you do why
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:32.720]  did you do it how did you do it who else was involved etc at the end of that testimony the
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:39.120]  trial judge says okay i accept the guilty plea but there is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:45.760]  he happens to be in the white house so the feds decided hmm let's prosecute trump on this
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:52.720]  cohen wouldn't even talk to them because they just put him in jail coven came along cohen gets out of
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:58.400]  jail was a low level uh prison farm they shut the whole place down because of covid because everybody
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:05.680]  lives in the same dormitory bedroom uh then he has to talk to cohen they interviewed him three times
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:13.120]  including two mock cross-examinations of him and they decided well this guy stinks this guy's
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:18.640]  terrible under cross-examination we can't build a case just on him so we're not going to prosecute
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:24.720]  the president cohen gets the idea of going to bragg saying well brag wasn't in office and went
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:30.480]  to cohen's to brag's predecessor sy vance saying why don't you use me as a witness against the
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:38.400]  president sy vance says okay let's develop the case sy vance decides not to seek reelection brag comes
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:43.040]  in looks at the case goes i'm not going there my job's to clean up the streets i don't care about
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:50.400]  donald trump then his prosecutors quits you can't make this stuff up writes a book about all the
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:57.440]  evidence against donald trump brag reads the book decides they better gin up this investigation
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:05.440]  again they do they interview cohen 21 times with four mock cross-examinations this time cohen is
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:10.000]  well prepared he does well in the cross-examinations yeah they're basically training him so he's going
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:18.080]  to college for this pretty much so brag's team of prosecutors say cohen is credible the federal team
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:24.560]  of prosecutors say cohen is not credible brag says give me the documents to back up what you say
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:29.440]  cohen gives them a mountain of documents trump documents trump organization documents cohen
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:34.640]  law firm documents cohen personal documents they analyze everything and they say we have a case
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:38.320]  here all right stay there another break another break this is riveting stuff we're going to come

[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:46.960]  napolitano uh you wanted to get we're talking during the break you want to get in and there's
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:51.600]  one of my questions i forgot to ask the gag order i don't know if the judge did it no one's
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:56.640]  reporting it yet is it constitutional could they actually do it would it be election meddling judge
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:02.960]  andrew napolitano well judges are understandably loathe to impose gag orders i mean the first
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:07.040]  amendment says congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech but today it means
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:14.960]  no government federal state or local executive legislative or judicial shall interfere with the
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:19.920]  freedom of speech i mean trump may be a criminal defendant but he's innocent until proven guilty
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:26.480]  and he has the same free speech rights as everybody else however if he begins aggressively
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:32.320]  attacking the prosecutors to the point where they feel threatened or the same with respect to the
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:36.880]  judge they will caution him and warn him and ask him to stop and if he doesn't stop this will
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:42.160]  build up a bit of a drumbeat and they may impose a gag order on him just with respect to this case
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:50.240]  now that is the last thing that joe takapina and the president's lawyers want because don
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:57.440]  slams judge well i'd like to hear what he said because if this keeps up and the judge orders him
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:04.240]  not to attack the judiciary or judicial system look what they did to roger stone it's going to
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:11.600]  be on the show in a few minutes roger stone suffered under the most aggressive unconstitutional
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:17.200]  gag order i've ever heard of in the modern era uh the court appellate court wouldn't rule on it
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:23.920]  until after his trial was over uh but roger quite properly complied with the gag order because they
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:29.280]  didn't want to go to jail i don't know what trump will do so most gag orders are limited just to a
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:36.640]  certain area of speech but courts are reluctant to do it uh how they could silence him when he's
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:40.080]  running for president consistent with the first amendment is beyond me
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:46.560]  i've got a daily mail report here we'll put up on the screen i can't believe this is happening
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:52.400]  in america trump post on true social just before being placed under arrest as he surrenders
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:56.320]  the newark city court in swarming daniels hush money incident
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:03.680]  do you think the democrats knew how bad this would blow up in their face but like you said
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:08.960]  i think they're so desperate politically they wanted to actually bring him back into the news
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:13.520]  even though it makes him bigger because then he energizes their base and everything becomes trump
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:17.840]  instead of all their crimes whereas we had a new republican and i'm supporting trump and i'm
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:23.200]  backing him and this is wrong he's being persecuted and he really you know i mean i'm not i'm just
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:30.800]  saying separately we had a new smart clean candidate who would just promote basic americanism
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:37.360]  then we actually get stuff done it's like when trump it sucks all the oxygen out of the room
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:46.800]  well i agree with you alex that the democrats want to energize trump's base the base they
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:52.400]  are energizing is in the republican party the democrats want the republicans to nominate trump
[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:58.800]  for president because they believe and here i agree with them uh if trump is the republican
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:04.240]  nominee then the issue is not joe biden's stewardship as president which in my view and
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:08.400]  your view and the view of almost everybody watching and listening now is indefensible
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:14.160]  the issue becomes trump's character personality and alleged crimes and trump energizes the
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:19.840]  democratic base which is far larger than the republican base uh to come out and vote for old
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:26.800]  joe in droves now whether joe would serve the full term or pick a new vice president one for whom he
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:33.600]  would graciously resign and hand the presidency over i don't know but it's clear that the
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:41.360]  establishment has lined up all of these cases the civil rape case coming in two weeks mar-a-lago
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:50.480]  january 6th atlanta georgia this one in order to energize trump's base i happen to think that other
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:56.320]  republican candidates we can get into names if you want would be stronger because they would
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:03.120]  focus the media on biden's horrific presidency because they don't have the baggage that trump
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:09.440]  does i didn't think biden could hang on this long he makes a clown on himself every day but i guess
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:14.240]  the deep state kind of likes undermine the country like this but looking at the fetterman model been
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:21.360]  in the hospital six seven weeks can't even talk hears voices i guess having idiots as leaders is
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:28.000]  the new globalist model i don't think joe biden's running the federal uh government you know he's
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:34.800]  their front person because he was elected i think a military uh decisions which are leading us into
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:42.320]  world war three are being made by uh jake sullivan uh and tony blinken and economic decisions are
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:49.440]  being made by janet yellen and joe whom everybody knows is uh challenged mentally due to his age
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:56.480]  uh is just pretty much just their their yes man he can't debate trump or anybody in a debate
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:02.640]  today can barely answer questions from uh reporters but jake sullivan his head of
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:09.600]  national security is his national security advisor is of the view i believe that joe can
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:16.320]  get re-elected if he is a wartime president uh and they're nudging us every day closer and closer to
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:22.960]  war uh in the ukraine well sure and i mean wilson was president for a long time in a coma and then
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:27.760]  they and they think that uh roosevelt was dead a month before we got told about it so they had
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:32.160]  dead presidents before so don't think just because he's corpse like that he couldn't do it again that
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:38.720]  they'll just roll him out like with a big glass jar with a brain in it well you know they they
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:45.920]  they will stoop to conquer uh they're stooping to manipulate the republican votes in the republican
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:52.480]  primary with these prosecutions only one now but you'll see others soon uh against trump that's
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:57.760]  that's their um that's their mantra all right judge appolitano stay right there final long

[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:34.080]  trained under alex jones and under the info wars team and i really do credit that as to why i'm
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:40.000]  able to you know get these types of clips because alex's whole mentality was you know go where the

[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:50.640]  just addicted to telling the truth and helping the american people and i really do credit alex

[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:58.400]  here

[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:08.000]  that documents the globalists in their own words planned for our future that is a hellish future
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.600]  now you'll be always while they still allow books i guess they're starting to ban them

[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:25.600]  after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now

[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:48.480]  book or unsigned copies but i want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to info war
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:53.600]  short.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:57.920]  give them to the local school this is an info war i'm counting on you and thank you for your support
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:07.280]  i intend to take the info wars armored truck out or the info wars tank as it's so lovingly called
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:11.440]  you came through yesterday and shopped at info war store.com so i'm gonna be able to take the truck
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:22.400]  out
[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:52.400]  so
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:06.400]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:14.000]  so it's almost hard to believe that the republican party's leading presidential
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:20.560]  candidate as of tonight by 30 points could be told by a judge that he will go to jail if he
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:26.080]  dares to defend himself in his own criminal case could that actually happen well it happened to
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:31.360]  roger stone and nobody seemed to care we did no one else did roger stone is a long-time
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:35.760]  republican strategist worked for richard nixon through the rest up to and including trump
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:41.200]  runs stone zone.com joins us tonight to assess this roger stone thanks so much for coming on
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:45.040]  you're the first person we thought of because this happened to you and i remember people saying well
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:49.760]  roger stone's a troublemaker it's okay if he's not allowed to defend himself and see them can attack
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:57.600]  him but he can't fight back maybe this will awaken people to how immoral this is look i think the idea
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:03.680]  that they might gag donald trump is really a testimony to his effectiveness uh as a counter
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:10.640]  puncher he's used social media and his interviews to very effectively question the falsity of these
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:16.800]  charges question the political motivations and funding of district attorney alvin bragg
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:24.000]  and to question the bias of this judge but more importantly not only do i think the gag order
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.360]  would be unconstitutional nowhere does it say you lose your free speech rights if you're
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:34.880]  charged with a crime but more importantly it's election interference he is a legal candidate for
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:41.280]  the 2024 republican nomination he's leading by closer to 40 points in the polls and this is a
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:46.800]  very clear efforts to try to break his momentum you can see in the polls and in the money that
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:53.680]  he is raising that the stronger the they hit him the harder they hit him the more his support grows
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:49:00.640]  so i think canceling him now gagging him now uh is a reaction to the way he has rebounded
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:06.400]  and actually benefited from what is that naked partisan attack against him but but to use the
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.320]  legal system to affect an attack like that is just beyond the pale in the beginning of the end i
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:15.600]  remember when judge amy burman jackson who's completely out of control did this to you and
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:20.000]  the pretext was well if you talk in your own defense in public you could influence the jury
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:25.520]  but she didn't gag cnn which spent a year attacking you every day or msnbc or the new
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:31.600]  york times like this doesn't even make sense as as a legal order well not only that but she kept
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:37.680]  the gag order in my case uh in place after i was already convicted after there was already a verdict
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:43.520]  i would have gone to jail under a drag or gag order if president trump hadn't seen the unjustness
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:48.640]  and ridiculousness of the charges against me by the way there was never any evidence of
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:55.040]  russian collusion wikileaks collaboration or any other crime as robert muller admitted in his
[02:49:55.040 --> 02:50:02.160]  final long redacted report and those who say well the gag order would just be narrow it would only
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:06.320]  relate to these charges these charges are politically motivated this is
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:12.640]  part of the campaign against donald trump yeah but if you can't speak in your own defense in public
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:19.040]  and only your critics have the freedom of speech i mean at you know at that point darkness has
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:23.440]  descended and i don't think it's an opportunity the rogerstone thank you thank you tucker
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:33.360]  that was me last night
[02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:49.680]  okay i'm sorry that was me uh last night uh i'm tucker carlson now i'm stepping in for alex jones
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:55.920]  who as you know was a called to the bankruptcy court and to help us break this down well one
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:51:01.840]  of the most brilliant legal minds in the united states perhaps in the world my good friend judge
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:09.840]  andrew napolitano joins us now roger it's a pleasure it's not expected pleasure i didn't
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:14.720]  know that you'd be filling in for alex but a pleasure uh nonetheless of course i'm not
[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:21.520]  dressed appropriately for the stone zone i thought i would raise that before before you did but to be
[02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:28.560]  serious your interview with tucker was terrific i remember suffering through this with you
[02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:36.160]  writing publicly and aggressively when i was at fox against what uh judge jackson did to you and
[02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:42.640]  even interviewing you on my show and we had to be so gingerly god forbid i should have asked and you
[02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:47.920]  should have responded anything uh about uh the case that probably would have indicted the two
[02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:56.560]  of us for conspiracy to violate her uh gag order uh fortunately most judges in fact every judge i
[02:51:56.560 --> 02:52:02.400]  know i don't know judge jackson personally and i don't know the judge in trump's case are loathe
[02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:11.200]  to impose a gag order on anyone much less a public figure i would be surprised if a gag order comes
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:18.080]  now as we speak i don't know if the president is still in that courtroom i would imagine if if a
[02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:23.120]  gag order has been issued today we'd know about it by now i'd be stunned if it is i would think
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:29.760]  it would have to be some showing that trump's first amendment rights are being used or abused
[02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:36.800]  to uh impair the judicial system as the case law reads before they would impose a gag order so i
[02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:42.720]  don't expect one uh today roger stated differently the former president will be treated far better
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:48.800]  by this new york state judge than you were treated by a federal judge in washington dc
[02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:55.440]  a few years ago well in all fairness that is exactly the point you made on the stone zone
[02:52:55.440 --> 02:53:01.440]  earlier this week um i i still think it remains to be seen by the way they didn't they did not
[02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:08.320]  levy the or issue the gag order against me uh at arraignment it was only after my lawyers proved
[02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:14.560]  that the fbi never inspected the computer servers at the democratic national committee that they
[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:21.120]  decided that my speaking openly was made me an enemy of the state and i had to be gagged uh judge
[02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:29.920]  i guess my question is in light of this stunning leak today how could it be that mike isacoff the
[02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:37.600]  very same reporter uh who the fbi gave the steel dossier to uh and whose story regarding the steel
[02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:45.280]  dossier pendulum by the fbi was then subsequently used by the department of justice uh as evidence
[02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:52.800]  to justify their uh false iso warrant uh pops up with this story today it underlines the precise
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:58.960]  problem with any potential gag uh even before we have a gag donald trump learns that he's going to
[02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:05.520]  be charged not by formal notification of the government uh but by a leak to the new york times
[02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:12.320]  we learn that there's 34 charges against him or counts against him not in any formal proceeding
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:19.760]  but in the story a leak to mike isacoff of all people is that not the real danger here in other
[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:26.400]  words he's a candidate for president uh he is he has got obviously first amendment rights but
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:31.200]  whether there's a gag order or whether there's a not a gag order alvin bragg has already demonstrated
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:36.080]  that his office will leak like a sim how does the president deal with this
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:42.640]  well the government of the best leakers around and the best leakers in the government are the fbi
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:49.120]  you know that personally uh from your own prosecution the former president knows that
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:57.040]  i don't know who the leaker is uh in bragg's office uh in in in the federal case they leaked
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:02.800]  information and bootstrapped that into what they use to get warrants which is probably criminal
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:08.000]  uh in this case it's a it's only a violation of legal ethics to leak something an hour before
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:14.400]  it's going to become public anyway but the government has its favorite leakies people to
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:20.320]  whom it likes to leak information because those people like michael isacoff will get it out there
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:25.680]  and we'll get it out with spin that the government wants on it and we'll get it out there
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:30.720]  before the public has the chance to examine the document on their own now as we sit here
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:36.080]  it's five minutes of three on the east coast of the united states donald trump has already pleaded
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:42.880]  not guilty i have not seen you have not seen the public has not seen the indictment it sounds like
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:48.960]  no one has seen it except isacoff and whatever works for him so i don't know if it's just stormy
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:54.960]  daniels or if it involves other cases as well i don't know what all 34 counts uh would be unless
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:02.400]  every time trump touched a piece of paper in the case uh that's a different count otherwise i'm i'm
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:10.560]  i'm at a loss to explain what's in there until i read it just based on what we do know uh assuming
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:17.280]  that that alvin bragg is successful in taking a business records reporting misdemeanor and
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:23.680]  twisting it into a felony has not the statute of limitations run on this long ago and and what of
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:30.080]  the district attorney's argument that covet 19 somehow stops the clock in that regard i've never
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:37.040]  seen any such law that says that well uh governor cuomo when he was the governor of new york was
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:45.280]  given extraordinary uh emergency powers uh and he did toll all tall meaning it's the legal phrase
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:51.280]  legal words stop the running of all statutes of limitations during the coven emergency but i don't
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:57.360]  think alvin bragg will make that argument has the statute of limitations run well the underlying
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:03.120]  crime alleged crime the one to which michael cohen pleaded guilty which is the use of corporate funds
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:09.360]  for campaign finance that's five years that happened in 2016 obviously more than five years
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:16.240]  ago the government will argue that while donald trump lived in the white house and voted from the
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:21.760]  white house and then renounced his new york citizenship moved to lived in and voted from
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:28.720]  florida the statute was told that the statute was only running when trump was physically located in
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:33.920]  new york now when i was on the bench i rejected those arguments because that's what the drafters
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:39.040]  of the legislation wanted they would have put it in there but they didn't however the prevailing
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:46.000]  view among judges is that that view holds so that argument is worth making if you're joe takapina
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:50.800]  but he'll probably lose the most banned man in america alex jones
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:58:01.840]  i want you all to know something alex jones was right alex is right about far more than
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:07.520]  he's wrong alex has been right on toward over a decade i don't care how you slice it dice it
[02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:13.840]  flip it up or rub it down alex jones was right think about how frustrated we are if you've been
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:18.320]  awake for a year or two imagine being like an alex jones or those guys who've been awake for
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:24.720]  like decades alex jones called this years ago years ago alex jones never bought the russia
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:31.680]  hoax not for a second you are one of the great thinkers of this you are a martyr to the first
[02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:38.160]  amendment the government fears alex jones that's why the globalists hate me is because i'm exposing

[03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:13.760]  so
[03:00:16.960 --> 03:00:18.320]  you know these days happen
[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:25.920]  way more often now there'll be days where alex and i are both in court
[03:00:27.840 --> 03:00:33.520]  and today it's donald trump in court or who knows a jail cell maybe and now alex jones is having to
[03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:39.840]  go to court but but i'm here now i'm good no court for me today but this is what it's like or
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:44.800]  back when i used to host with roger stone who just has left us
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:50.240]  there'd be times where he'd be dealing with court and going through legal stuff
[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:52.320]  and then i'd have to host the show and he wouldn't be on that day
[03:00:54.960 --> 03:01:00.480]  so this is what it's like to be politically persecuted it's just a regular thing now
[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:05.840]  constantly dealing with court constantly dealing with lawyers constantly dealing with the legal
[03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:14.560]  issues and this is what happens when the government gets weaponized by a criminal
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:24.000]  faction by a corrupt political party and we all know it as in the year 2023 in america the
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:27.040]  democrat party so
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:37.600]  it's going to be interesting to see what the real world response to this is because they're
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:44.480]  everything politically works in margins so trump getting arrested is really only adding small
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:50.320]  margins to his support base but the larger margins are going to be seen in the centrist
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:53.520]  the larger margins are going to be seen in the anti-establishment
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:57.520]  liberal that hasn't completely lost their mind and they're going to say wow
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:00.320]  donald trump is really being politically persecuted here
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:11.760]  and for him to be the one to take the fall for the corruption in dc is just pathetic but that's
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:14.880]  not even what they're claiming his crimes are they're not even saying he was doing anything
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:20.880]  while he was president they're saying oh look at all these women he used to sleep with and
[03:02:20.880 --> 03:02:27.840]  did he have hush payments so it's not even what was going on in the white house it's not even
[03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:34.800]  what was going on when he was president did stuff from years ago but i gotta tell you
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:43.680]  looking at all the footage from new york city and then the circus that's out there tell me how many
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:49.120]  people know what joe biden did today anybody know what joe biden was up to today
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:02:59.120]  no everybody's focusing on donald trump who's the real president
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:07.200]  joe biden has done some events he's done a handful of events on the road
[03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:13.600]  since he's been elected president was there ever a media gaggle was there ever a press circus
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:20.880]  was there ever the energy the attention the attendance to anything joe biden has done
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:26.640]  as president i'm not even talking about trump rallies that's a whole nother story i'm talking
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:34.240]  about look at the circus in new york city today the press the support the hate all of it trump's
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:43.040]  the real president not joe biden and it's just total proof that all even the democrat media
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:48.960]  can talk about is donald trump that's all the democrats talk about all day long is donald trump
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:57.120]  not what joe biden is doing if he's even doing anything at all no it's trump trump trump trump
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:05.040]  trump and this trend is not going to stop because trump's running for president and next they're
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:10.240]  going to be coming after him in georgia and then in dc and then who knows what else
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:12.800]  as laid out in the last
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:20.880]  hour by judge napolitano but when we rejoin the show after this short break for the fourth hour
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:26.160]  of the alex jones show we'll go over some of the sights some of the sounds from new york city today
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:34.720]  margery taylor green getting on a bullhorn uh just the mass amount of people that are out there
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:44.960]  and elon musk has just shared a donald trump meme i'm not sure he might have made this one
[03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:50.320]  himself i hadn't seen it before is elon musk who said he's not a trump supporter could this even
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:05:01.840]  get elon musk to become a trump supporter humanity is in a fight for its very life
[03:05:02.560 --> 03:05:09.040]  and infowars for decades has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future

[03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:16.320]  texas command center and the heart of the resistance and now your host owen troyer
[03:06:16.400 --> 03:06:27.440]  well elon musk has just shared this meme not sure if he is the creator picture of donald trump
[03:06:27.440 --> 03:06:33.200]  with a quote from 1980 why do time travelers keep trying to kill me i'm just a realtor
[03:06:34.240 --> 03:06:39.840]  donald trump 1980 elon musk says if the democrats had a time machine
[03:06:39.840 --> 03:06:50.800]  that's good stuff very true very true but they don't have a time machine what they do have
[03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:58.640]  is an army of trannies and an army of perverts and an army of delinquents and an army of lazy
[03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:06.880]  bum commies and an army of brainwashed zombies and an army of politically corrupt bureaucrats
[03:07:06.880 --> 03:07:15.920]  and attorneys and judges and so well their attempts to kill donald trump
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:22.960]  or maybe that hasn't been attempted yet or maybe who they sent back in time to kill donald trump
[03:07:22.960 --> 03:07:29.600]  failed and so now they just send the entire political system against him i mean
[03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:37.680]  it's almost unbelievable but hillary clinton admitted to i think that they paid the fine
[03:07:37.680 --> 03:07:49.520]  just like a year ago hillary clinton admitted to using campaign funds to pay for the steel dossier
[03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:56.240]  they had to admit that so it always comes full circle the steel dossier proves trump
[03:07:56.240 --> 03:08:02.560]  russia collusion uh no it doesn't and actually the steel dossier was made up and paid for by
[03:08:02.560 --> 03:08:09.280]  hillary clinton and it all comes out six years after the 2016 election and the media lied to you
[03:08:09.280 --> 03:08:13.600]  and they lied to you for years and then hillary actually settles and says yeah well actually we
[03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:21.520]  spent 113 000 we paid for it it's true okay we'll pay a fine i'm sorry and the media went along for
[03:08:21.680 --> 03:08:24.880]  sorry and the media went along for the ride
[03:08:26.880 --> 03:08:35.360]  and did they ever apologize for lying to you eric trump is reporting this now breaking right now
[03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:45.760]  the ninth circuit just awarded trump 121 962.56 got to get it right down to that exact cent
[03:08:46.320 --> 03:08:52.240]  in attorney fees from stormy daniels order just released this in addition to roughly half a
[03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:55.680]  million she already owes him i was gonna say she already owes him money so that she just got hit
[03:08:55.680 --> 03:09:06.000]  again no it's hillary clinton that got caught with the campaign finance violations no no no
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:10.960]  it's illhan omar it's aoc with the campaign ethics finance violations
[03:09:10.960 --> 03:09:19.840]  but they go after donald trump even though he's already won lawsuits against stormy daniels
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:25.760]  and has her signature on a paper saying she never took hush money
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:34.960]  but what are the 37 or 47 or however many there are attorneys and prosecutors in new
[03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:41.040]  york that are saying this is the most we've ever seen from a grand jury even in even in
[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:47.840]  rape cases and and child sex abuse cases they they won't even go over 30 charges because it's
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:52.560]  just i mean it's just it's just ridiculous i mean even if you want to throw the book at somebody
[03:09:53.120 --> 03:09:59.840]  like 20 25 is usually the number there that's like the book is 25 charges they got him on 37
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:07.760]  is what the leaked documents uh whoever they were leaked to that's what they're reporting 37 charges
[03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:18.080]  so obviously monitoring this situation alex stein is going to be joining me in 20 minutes
[03:10:18.720 --> 03:10:25.440]  my intention when i host the war room is to take calls from end to end i don't believe do
[03:10:25.440 --> 03:10:30.160]  we have any guests on the warm today last i checked we didn't so we should be end to end
[03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:36.080]  your response to this has this made you like trump more like trump less do you think it helps trump
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:41.600]  politically hurt trump politically is the deep state desperate or is this going to be a true
[03:10:42.640 --> 03:10:50.240]  a true exhibition of just how powerful and corrupt they are with nobody to answer to and you know i
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:55.840]  gotta tell you though as i see this really it kind of breaks my heart because
[03:10:59.280 --> 03:11:03.520]  i don't know if it's that did i choose the political life did the political life choose me
[03:11:04.080 --> 03:11:06.400]  i really can't stand the politics because it's so divisive
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:15.680]  and you've got it again it's 2016 all over again a group of trump supporters behind a barricade
[03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:21.360]  and then the group of the trump haters behind the barricade shouting at one another screaming at one
[03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:25.440]  another shouting the obscenities everybody's got their signs and everybody's got their
[03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:35.040]  paraphernalia and everything else and it's just sad it's just sad now i as sad as it is
[03:11:37.360 --> 03:11:42.880]  the the honest truth is obviously hey i'm not you don't have to like donald trump i can understand
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:49.600]  why you don't like donald trump but if you're out there as an anti-trump protester saying this is a
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:59.120]  good thing he's being arrested you're a brainwashed idiot and it's sad that this is what we're up
[03:11:59.120 --> 03:12:09.280]  against so it's it's it's symbolic it's symbolic the will of the people united
[03:12:09.280 --> 03:12:17.520]  could actually do wonders to help this country and that's us
[03:12:19.920 --> 03:12:26.880]  and then we have to stare into the face of these brainwashed zombie hordes that call us
[03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:32.400]  racists and bigots and transphobes and homophobes and xenophobes and everything else
[03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:36.720]  simply because we want to have a better country simply because we
[03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:43.440]  have envisioned a better future and we see where the trend is going right now into authoritarianism
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:48.800]  and we would just like to stop that and reverse it and then here are these brainwashed freaks
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:53.520]  screaming in our face spitting in our face celebrating our demise
[03:12:56.800 --> 03:13:01.520]  and then they're aimed against us so it's it's the brainwashed hordes being aimed against us
[03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:09.200]  and now it's the corrupt government institutions and agents being aimed against us
[03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:15.280]  so yeah alex couldn't be on air to do extended coverage today because he's got to be in court and
[03:13:15.920 --> 03:13:20.800]  yeah donald trump just got arrested today because the democrats are trying to take him out as he's
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:27.200]  running for president or do they think this is going to boost him and maybe that's why they're
[03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:37.600]  doing it not exactly how i see it and maybe alvin bragg has just gone rogue but since i can take
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:42.000]  calls and just keep the same callers on the line heading into the war room why don't i get out the
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:53.600]  number now 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 i imagine everybody's got something to say or or to think
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:14:00.400]  about the situation with donald trump today now we know it it's happened he's he's i guess being
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:03.680]  arraigned right now who knows he might be in cuffs right now might be in a cell i don't know
[03:14:04.400 --> 03:14:08.080]  they said no cuffs no mug shots all that stuff do you trust these crooks i don't for a second
[03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:14.640]  so we're watching monitoring the the circus scene truly it is a historical moment in american
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:19.840]  history that uh today unprecedented the images of trump the motorcade the scenes all of it is
[03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:26.800]  going to live in american history forever the image of donald trump's gold head bobbing up and

[03:19:52.160 --> 03:19:59.920]  national television that he was gonna win at infowarsstore.com leading a frontal assault on
[03:19:59.920 --> 03:20:14.560]  the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:30.160]  all right we're getting your calls lined up and we're going to be taking your calls
[03:20:30.720 --> 03:20:38.080]  for the next four hours or really i guess three hours and 40 minutes when the war room kicks off
[03:20:38.080 --> 03:20:46.160]  we'll keep taking calls elon musk at it again rage for the machine man who agrees with the
[03:20:46.160 --> 03:20:52.640]  media universities corporations and hollywood thinks he's part of the resistance rage for the
[03:20:52.640 --> 03:21:00.800]  machine yeah you're so i'm anti-establishment and i do everything the establishment tells me to do
[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:10.160]  like hate trump it's truly astounding isn't it and there's basic principles that you need to
[03:21:10.160 --> 03:21:17.680]  understand it's kind of like the laws of physics there's laws of politics you can't avoid the laws
[03:21:17.680 --> 03:21:27.680]  of physics you can't avoid the laws of politics a liberal a leftist your average democrat if they're
[03:21:27.680 --> 03:21:34.240]  still if they're still loud and proud democrat they don't have any foundation anymore they don't
[03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:43.280]  have any beliefs fundamentals it's all what you support they oppose that's all it is now
[03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:45.520]  so you like trump they hate trump
[03:21:50.400 --> 03:21:56.080]  you don't want to see minors get genuinely mutilated they love it they're going to promote
[03:21:56.080 --> 03:21:59.200]  it they're going to march for it they're going to protest for it they're going to rally for it
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:06.160]  they're going to make a big scene for it so that's how this goes so that's what it is it's rage for
[03:22:06.160 --> 03:22:14.160]  the machine but how they don't see the irony of thinking they're anti-establishment when everything
[03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:19.680]  they do is exactly what the establishment tells them how don't how can how can they not see that
[03:22:19.680 --> 03:22:26.880]  again it's the laws of politics because their whole ideology is based off being against
[03:22:26.880 --> 03:22:35.840]  you anti-you that's the laws of politics i can't change it i didn't write them but that's what it
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:42.000]  is so you're confused why does the liberal that say he's anti-establishment do everything for
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:46.080]  the establishment because you're now anti-establishment so he's now pro-establishment
[03:22:46.640 --> 03:22:47.360]  see how that works
[03:22:49.600 --> 03:22:55.440]  that's how it works that's the laws of politics the raging progressive liberal democrat is just
[03:22:55.440 --> 03:23:03.920]  anti-you so that's why they get so confused when i go out to an event and i'm pro-abortion
[03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:10.640]  and you can see their entire political paradigm breaks down or i go out in the tank and i say i'm
[03:23:11.200 --> 03:23:17.920]  pro for the war in ukraine and it's like what or if i go to a comedy bit and i'm pro-trans kids
[03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:24.080]  because now they don't know what to do because now if i'm pro-trans kids then they must be
[03:23:24.080 --> 03:23:30.000]  anti-trans kids but what that's not what they're taught that's why it's so easy to break these
[03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:38.320]  people down and they go into an absolute mental breakdown and conniption fit i've documented many
[03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:43.520]  this uh many many times this with the crew alex stein as well who's joining me in 10 minutes can
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:49.040]  tell you all about it and his recent sights and sounds and scenes dealing with these crazy trans
[03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:56.800]  people um and then also outside of trump tower in new york so that's all coming up but again folks
[03:23:57.440 --> 03:24:03.360]  remember if you were anticipating the fun t-shirt with donald trump's mugshot on it but oh you
[03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:07.280]  thought we're going to be let down there's no mugshot think again we've got it at info
[03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:13.040]  where store.com this is limited edition the trump political prisoner shirt and if you're wondering
[03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:19.200]  hey why isn't he in an orange jumpsuit for this well we wanted to be factually accurate here and
[03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:23.920]  when you're turn yourself in and then you get arraigned even if you do spend a couple hours
[03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:29.520]  in a jail cell like i did they don't actually put you in a jumpsuit for that now if they decided to
[03:24:29.520 --> 03:24:36.240]  not release him which would shock us all but i guess it's not out of the realm of possibility
[03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:41.120]  if they decided to not release him then they would be putting on a jumpsuit and probably
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:46.880]  going to rikers island um just like the man that worked for donald trump that they claimed
[03:24:47.760 --> 03:24:53.600]  was guilty of tax evasion because he was driving a car he was driving a car owned by uh the trump
[03:24:53.600 --> 03:25:00.000]  company and he wasn't paying taxes on it because he was driving a company car just just first of
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:04.720]  all that shouldn't even be a crime but second of all it's total total political persecution and
[03:25:04.720 --> 03:25:09.120]  torture sending him to rikers island with some of the worst criminals from new york
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:16.240]  total political persecution and this has happened to a lot of people around donald trump
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:23.440]  roger stone paul Manafort you name it so this is what it's like
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:31.200]  this is what it's like i mean people are stunned
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:35.840]  with the stuff that i go through and they think you're not that controversial i don't understand
[03:25:36.880 --> 03:25:43.200]  well let's keep in mind that they're throwing nukes at alex jones every day and i'm i'm alex
[03:25:43.200 --> 03:25:49.360]  jones you know next door neighbor and i'm like hanging out at his at his house a lot having
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:53.840]  dinner and so like he's getting nuked like yeah the radiation is hitting me i'm getting nuked too
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:58.160]  so you might not think i'm that controversial or you might not think i'm that big of a deal but
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:03.600]  big of a deal but the establishment hates me too and i'm getting i'm getting some of the flack that
[03:26:03.600 --> 03:26:08.880]  alex takes every day so same thing happens to trump and then they come after your family too
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:12.960]  but i don't want to get too much into this because i want to take your calls and response
[03:26:13.760 --> 03:26:17.280]  positive for trump negative for trump i mean what are your friends and family saying are
[03:26:17.280 --> 03:26:22.400]  they commenting on this the the apolitical we're going to be doing this for the next four hours
[03:26:22.400 --> 03:26:27.760]  right here at infowars myself with you finishing up the alex jones show and then all throughout
[03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:34.000]  the war room alex nine coming up as well let's start though with rick in arizona
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:36.960]  rick you're on the alex jones show go ahead
[03:26:43.440 --> 03:26:51.600]  oh it's the clown world and i'll i'll tell you what we got to get the elections handled
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:56.480]  because it doesn't matter what kind of crap show is on here and what's going on
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:03.600]  if the votes aren't you know on our side if they cheat if they have so so let me just pause it let
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:08.880]  me just pause you right there because because you bring up an extremely important point that
[03:27:08.880 --> 03:27:14.560]  i don't think you're wrong about and i really i really had a deep thought about this last night
[03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:21.280]  because one of the hardest things for us to do is to see the world through somebody else's
[03:27:21.280 --> 03:27:27.200]  perspective or or even just from a larger drawn out perspective and while yes
[03:27:28.640 --> 03:27:32.560]  there's no reason to think they won't steal the election from trump in 2024
[03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:37.680]  there i mean in fact there's every reason to believe they will now will it work can they
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:41.760]  beat a landslide i mean but but here's what i think it comes down to rick because
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:48.080]  this is what we have to understand the awakening has to happen before there's going to be any real
[03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:53.520]  change i think that's what we're learning here we can't vote our way out of this and we can't
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:28:00.880]  even cultural have a cultural revolution out of this the the the the infrastructure created by
[03:28:00.880 --> 03:28:08.720]  the deep state criminal ball is just too entrenched even when we get somebody in the white house it's
[03:28:08.720 --> 03:28:16.480]  too entrenched but so imagine this though you're probably right let's say trump gets massive
[03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:23.360]  landslide of support after this heading in and then and then is the nominee and in 2024 same
[03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:30.000]  story massive rallies 50,000 at every rally three a week you name it and then he loses again
[03:28:33.440 --> 03:28:40.720]  that might be the one where the average american finally says and realizes okay my country is gone
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:47.760]  i didn't vote for trump i'm not even political but everybody i know voted for trump and somehow
[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:55.120]  he lost after 90 million votes joe biden gets a hundred this time nobody's gonna buy that nobody

[03:33:21.600 --> 03:33:31.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show okay it is now official donald trump has left the courthouse
[03:33:32.240 --> 03:33:37.600]  and we're assuming on his way back to trump tower in new york city with of course his massive
[03:33:38.160 --> 03:33:46.320]  motorcade and police escort so it went like this he turned himself in
[03:33:48.080 --> 03:33:52.080]  i'm assuming that they never cuffed him we never saw him in cuffs i'm assuming they never put him
[03:33:52.080 --> 03:33:58.160]  in a jail cell because that was never reported so that means they took him they processed him
[03:33:58.160 --> 03:34:02.320]  they probably at least fingerprinted him i don't even know what they did that because normally this
[03:34:02.320 --> 03:34:10.480]  process is i mean i've been through it you go in there you wait for the agents to make the arrest
[03:34:11.200 --> 03:34:19.200]  they make the arrest they take you to processing that's where you'll i mean sometimes they'll cuff
[03:34:19.200 --> 03:34:23.120]  you there just cuff you to a bench or something and then until they have the available officers
[03:34:23.120 --> 03:34:29.120]  to come over there take your mugshot take your fingerprints anything else at which point then
[03:34:29.120 --> 03:34:35.200]  they'll cuff you take you to a jail cell and that's where you wait until you get arraigned
[03:34:35.200 --> 03:34:44.640]  by a judge could take up to hours and then depending on the case the judge either releases you
[03:34:44.640 --> 03:34:52.560]  or you go to jail while you await your trial so all we know at this point is
[03:34:53.680 --> 03:35:01.440]  trump turned himself in they processed him without cuffing him or jailing him they probably made the
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:06.160]  arrangements so that he went right in front of a judge got arraigned was read all the
[03:35:06.160 --> 03:35:12.480]  charges that probably took a minute since there's 34 of them to which he pled not guilty trump
[03:35:12.480 --> 03:35:19.040]  pleads not guilty to 34 felony accounts or 24 felony counts falsifying business records
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:26.640]  um okay then he got released and now they are on their way back to trump tower uh we are getting
[03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:31.200]  connected with alex stein who's been out there on the streets of new york city and in front
[03:35:31.200 --> 03:35:41.920]  of trump tower watching this but you know it's like is it even worth getting into what probably
[03:35:41.920 --> 03:35:47.600]  happened here at worst is it even worth it does it even matter at this point
[03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:52.960]  because you can sit here and say okay well
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:36:00.080]  even though michael cohen already signed the documents and stormy daniels already signed
[03:36:00.080 --> 03:36:06.240]  the documents saying that this is not what happened but what they're trying to claim
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:12.720]  happened and we'll see what happens when the 34 charges come out is that donald trump used
[03:36:12.720 --> 03:36:18.640]  campaign money to pay michael cohen to pay stormy daniels hush money
[03:36:20.960 --> 03:36:25.120]  and so i mean that that's worst case scenario if that's even true
[03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:34.240]  and so if that is true then stormy daniels and michael cohen have just falsified their own legal
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:40.400]  records with their signatures and committed crimes as well so that means that brad cohen
[03:36:41.520 --> 03:36:50.240]  and daniels all committing crimes here who leaked the 34 charges it didn't come from
[03:36:50.240 --> 03:36:57.200]  trump's office because they never even got them which again is totally normal when i
[03:36:57.200 --> 03:37:01.120]  knew i was getting charged and had to turn myself in we did not get the actual
[03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:06.480]  charges we didn't know what they were until i got in front of the judge
[03:37:08.480 --> 03:37:13.840]  so all types of shenanigans but again whether trump made the payments or not
[03:37:16.960 --> 03:37:20.240]  whether it was illegal or not whatever happened it really doesn't even matter
[03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:26.640]  because this is total political persecution total selective enforcement and the democrats
[03:37:26.720 --> 03:37:30.720]  interfering with an election like they always do and then blame you for that
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:39.040]  so it's we're gonna we're gonna see the response to the american people again i've got the phone
[03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:44.640]  lines lit up we're gonna be taking your calls all afternoon but i've got alex stein joining me now
[03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:51.200]  and i'm sorry because i'm a little off kilter here are you back in your pimp in a blimp studios
[03:37:51.200 --> 03:37:58.160]  yes we are in the mother blimp right now primetime 99 i'm on the grind all the time
[03:37:58.160 --> 03:38:02.800]  even though i'm in new york city the next day i have obligations at the blaze i have to fulfill
[03:38:02.800 --> 03:38:07.440]  so we have an incredible show this evening but it's an honor to come on with you owen
[03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:13.840]  so you were out there in new york city you saw the scenes the chaos i mean let's talk about it
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:20.480]  how insane was that well i mean really the energy around the courthouse was kind of how you expected
[03:38:20.480 --> 03:38:25.200]  a lot of people like all the mainstream media was just looking for donald trump wanting to you know
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:30.080]  try to get the one shot of him walking in the building so like all the hungry media were out
[03:38:30.080 --> 03:38:33.680]  there that was you know kind of interesting to see and then there was a lot of supporters i
[03:38:33.680 --> 03:38:38.320]  mean yesterday i was there and there's only a few quote-unquote counter protesters owen but most of
[03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:43.840]  the people there were fans of donald trump as a matter of fact i wouldn't even say uh it was just
[03:38:43.840 --> 03:38:47.840]  fans even the people that don't like donald trump there knew it was a sham like the homeless people
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:53.600]  that are walking by the crackheads on the street those people are like this is a joke so if those
[03:38:53.600 --> 03:38:58.240]  people that are high on fentanyl know that this is a waste of resources and i think the american
[03:38:58.240 --> 03:39:03.440]  people will feel that same way well and i always try to draw myself back whether it's from my own
[03:39:03.440 --> 03:39:07.680]  bias or my own bubble or my own world view and because you know we all tend to do that
[03:39:09.200 --> 03:39:13.680]  and i'm thinking how does this look to the bigger picture how does this look to the average american
[03:39:13.680 --> 03:39:18.080]  that quite frankly is just not informed and they just don't really care about politics but they're
[03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:23.360]  going to see this they're going to see trump getting arrested and i think the average american
[03:39:23.360 --> 03:39:28.960]  response is going to be this is persecution this is bullcrap trump is the bad guy trump's not the
[03:39:28.960 --> 03:39:34.000]  problem in dc i might not like trump but i know he's not the problem is that what you think is
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:39.600]  going on here because that's what i think is going on well i don't i don't want to be doom
[03:39:39.760 --> 03:39:44.320]  pills or black pills but i think this will give a lot of the people that are moderate something
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:48.880]  to hang their hat on they're gonna say oh donald trump was he was charged with a crime so he's a
[03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:53.040]  criminal so i think some of those you know soft-branded people actually will be convinced
[03:39:53.040 --> 03:39:57.440]  by this and they'll think donald trump is uh you know some sort of evil person but the people that
[03:39:57.440 --> 03:40:01.120]  are actually paying attention it's going to radicalize him similar to roe vs wade when
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:04.480]  they overturned that and we thought there's going to be a red wave it kind of radicalized the last
[03:40:04.480 --> 03:40:08.640]  forgotten vote but i think this is going to radicalize the right even more so i mean we
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:13.520]  were radicalized with the gay jeffrey abstein all the uh you know elite people that are doing
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:18.320]  terrible things we were kind of radicalized by that in 2016 we thought oh it's not going to
[03:40:18.320 --> 03:40:22.320]  happen to us but now the people that are actually paying attention they're seeing the illegal
[03:40:22.320 --> 03:40:27.200]  persecution of donald trump when you look at joe biden's illegal business deals in the ukraine
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:32.240]  you look at hillary clinton's kill list you look at bronc obama's married to a boy more than likely
[03:40:32.240 --> 03:40:36.800]  i'm just saying there's a lot of other things that we should be covering and not some misdemeanor
[03:40:36.800 --> 03:40:42.400]  buddy-duddy thing i mean absolutely i mean a potential a potential world war three situation
[03:40:42.400 --> 03:40:46.400]  where the u.s has no allies i mean literally all of our allies are banning us now japan just
[03:40:46.400 --> 03:40:51.120]  abandoned us i mean we have no allies anymore joe biden is we have no allies if a world war breaks
[03:40:51.120 --> 03:40:56.880]  out i don't know i don't know what america does quite frankly i mean so that's the situation and
[03:40:56.880 --> 03:41:02.000]  the u.s dollar is potentially on the verge of collapsing because now all these other countries
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:05.520]  are deciding and you know what we're going to deal in the chinese yuan or we're going to deal
[03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:09.280]  in the rupal or we're going to deal in indian currency and so this is i mean people don't even
[03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:13.440]  understand how big of a deal this is and only trump is the president that can get in there
[03:41:13.440 --> 03:41:18.160]  and and maybe try to reverse course on this and and and get us back on track where we need to be
[03:41:18.720 --> 03:41:24.400]  as far as geopolitically but i think that the american person you know the soft people like
[03:41:24.400 --> 03:41:29.360]  look at it like this because i feel like this is 2016 all over again and let's not let's not forget
[03:41:29.360 --> 03:41:36.400]  that most conservative media was against donald trump the republican party was against donald
[03:41:36.400 --> 03:41:42.800]  trump the political landscape has changed entirely heading into 2024 now most of the
[03:41:42.800 --> 03:41:47.120]  republican media is going to be supporting trump and even though the establishment gop might be
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:54.480]  against him it's not a a whirlwind yeah but oh and this is the problem is usually we don't have
[03:41:54.480 --> 03:41:59.120]  any allies but none of that matters because the only thing america still produces are bombed
[03:41:59.920 --> 03:42:04.000]  alibert rathian those are basically the only industries that we have left as a country
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  so if there's any war even if we don't have any allies we're going to be the ones selling them
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:12.080]  all the bombs so that's why the multinational corporations love the war and then you talk
[03:42:12.080 --> 03:42:17.360]  about uh you know how weak we're getting muammar gaddafi in libya his he was actually loved by
[03:42:17.360 --> 03:42:24.800]  his people he was loved by his people my gosh you just lost me no we got you we got you uh sorry
[03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:29.920]  sorry about that oh and we're having internet issues okay my point is muammar gaddafi i want
[03:42:29.920 --> 03:42:34.480]  to talk about this real quick in libya i know we gotta go to break he tried to take them off
[03:42:34.480 --> 03:42:38.160]  the african dinar and put them on excuse me they're trying to take them off the american
[03:42:38.160 --> 03:42:41.520]  gold standard and put them on the african dinar that's why they killed him and that's why they're
[03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:47.120]  slaying auctions in libya today except it's not going to be libya and hillary clinton laughing
[03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:52.160]  about how they killed gaddafi it's going to be putin it's going to be g it's going to be the
[03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:54.800]  saudis it's going to be india and now japan

[03:46:54.400 --> 03:47:10.880]  info war store.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:47:20.000 --> 03:47:32.080]  final segment here the alex jones show alex stein with me owen froyer here as we're monitoring
[03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:39.200]  trump's motorcade left the courthouse we're assuming back to his golden penthouse
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:46.240]  at trump tower the man's got class you know i wonder you'd think uh i wonder if milania is
[03:47:46.240 --> 03:47:50.640]  there waiting for him and did they have to make adjustments to the doors so that seven foot tall
[03:47:50.640 --> 03:47:55.440]  baron trump could get in there again folks if you're just joining us trump pleads not guilty
[03:47:55.440 --> 03:48:04.080]  34 felony counts falsifying business records you know i'm i'm kind of fed up already with kevin
[03:48:04.080 --> 03:48:09.120]  mccarthy as the speaker because he's done zero as far as i can tell he's got a zero on the board
[03:48:09.120 --> 03:48:13.680]  a couple months into his speakership if this doesn't motivate if this doesn't put wind in
[03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:18.240]  the sails of the republicans i mean it seems like the only one who's moving the needle at
[03:48:18.240 --> 03:48:22.560]  all now is marjorie taylor green i mean don't get me wrong i like jim jordan some of the stuff he's
[03:48:22.560 --> 03:48:27.120]  doing and ran paul going against fauci but i mean as far as somebody who's hitting the ground every
[03:48:27.120 --> 03:48:32.720]  day i mean maybe matt gates what are you seeing i mean if this doesn't galvanize the republican party
[03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:39.440]  to defend trump i don't know what will no that i think a lot of the people are afraid of trump
[03:48:39.440 --> 03:48:42.800]  especially the people that are quote-unquote conservatives i mean kevin mccarthy you think
[03:48:42.800 --> 03:48:49.440]  he likes donald trump no these guys are the gop the grand old party and trump is not necessarily
[03:48:49.440 --> 03:48:52.800]  you know that's not where he was born and bred that's not where he's from so i think that is
[03:48:52.800 --> 03:48:57.360]  the biggest issue is that then people on trump's side don't even like him and god bless marjorie
[03:48:57.360 --> 03:49:01.120]  taylor green some people you know you might not agree with her a hundred percent but she actually
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:05.920]  cares about america she's out there fighting for what she feels is right and she knows that this is
[03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:10.640]  an illegal prosecution i mean we just are gonna just sound like a broken record but this is what
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:14.240]  makes me the most frustrated well other than i don't know why they haven't shown the mugshot
[03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:18.080]  i want to put it on a t-shirt and sell it so i can become grifter of the year two times in a row
[03:49:18.080 --> 03:49:22.160]  but other than that no they didn't do the mugshot they didn't do the mugshot and and we've already
[03:49:22.160 --> 03:49:28.160]  had the t-shirts so sorry that's what i'm saying everybody's going to be selling that dang t-shirt
[03:49:28.160 --> 03:49:31.920]  after everybody's going to make money on that t-shirt they don't even want us to make money
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:39.040]  oh and they only want us to have a drop mugshot they'll never stop us no no we will figure out
[03:49:39.040 --> 03:49:46.080]  there it is there's our t-shirt infowarsdoor.com we beat alex stein to it yes go buy that shirt
[03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:51.600]  please go support the info war because like you know there's always that cliche it's you know uh
[03:49:51.600 --> 03:49:55.440]  trump's not you know they're not coming after trump they're coming after us trump is just in
[03:49:55.440 --> 03:49:59.680]  the way i don't even know if i said that that cliche right my point is is if you can see the
[03:49:59.680 --> 03:50:03.440]  illegal business feelings that all the prior presidents have done i mean you got bill clinton's
[03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:07.920]  actually getting bj's in the oval office he's on jeffrey ebstein's playing 26 times
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:17.040]  how much did clinton play paula jones guys was it 300 000 literally i mean they paid hush money
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:22.000]  hush money hush money to everybody no it's absolutely insane but alex while you're here
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:27.200]  i i got to get into something with you because you're one of the few individuals that that
[03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:32.640]  understands this and exposes it to the to the level that you do i mean you've you know you've
[03:50:32.640 --> 03:50:37.120]  you've catapulted into the stratosphere as far as your popularity is concerned and that's the
[03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:42.560]  culture jamming and and something that i've really come to understand at a really deep level
[03:50:43.440 --> 03:50:49.280]  is that the modern day american leftist liberal progressive democrat the reason why we're so
[03:50:49.280 --> 03:50:51.920]  confused at hey why do they claim to be anti-establishment but now they're
[03:50:51.920 --> 03:50:56.240]  pro-establishment all these other double standards and and double thinks that they have
[03:50:56.240 --> 03:50:59.920]  and and i've and i've really had a deep understanding oh there it is bill clinton
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:06.880]  paid her 850 000 of hush money okay 1998 all right so we got that but alex here's
[03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:14.160]  what i've i've really come to deeply understand the the average progressive liberal democrat now
[03:51:14.160 --> 03:51:20.880]  the only principle the only value the only foundation they stand on is opposing you that's
[03:51:20.880 --> 03:51:25.600]  it they don't actually they're not actually anti-war they're not anti-big pharma they're
[03:51:25.600 --> 03:51:32.080]  not anti-establishment that's all now been proven in triplicate so the reason why what you do is so
[03:51:32.080 --> 03:51:36.560]  great and sometimes i do it too with the culture jamming the reason why they get so confused is
[03:51:36.560 --> 03:51:41.200]  because they don't know what to do when they see alex stein supporting trans kids or when they see
[03:51:41.200 --> 03:51:45.600]  alex stein promoting you know the gay agenda all this stuff their their their worldview and their
[03:51:45.600 --> 03:51:50.320]  paradigm just breaks down because they're supposed to be against you so when you promote what they
[03:51:50.320 --> 03:51:56.640]  love they have mental breakdowns yeah no it definitely puts them in this weird mental
[03:51:56.640 --> 03:52:00.080]  gymnastics mode that they already live in so really they shouldn't be that surprised but
[03:52:00.080 --> 03:52:04.560]  unless it's like they old saying uh when a dog chases a car and they actually catch a car they
[03:52:04.560 --> 03:52:09.120]  don't know what to do and that's why they demonize people like alex jones is because they need a
[03:52:09.120 --> 03:52:14.640]  boogeyman they need a villain the media has to have some sort of physical embodiment of what
[03:52:14.640 --> 03:52:19.920]  they think a villain is and so that's why they go after alex jones that's why they go after
[03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:24.080]  donald trump because donald trump is that people don't care about donald trump people don't hate
[03:52:24.080 --> 03:52:29.520]  donald trump they hate what donald trump stands for they hate what alex jones stands for so that's
[03:52:29.520 --> 03:52:34.240]  why it gives them a villain oh that's why i hate them so that's why i use the culture jam is i try
[03:52:34.240 --> 03:52:40.080]  to appeal to them and i try to use the most absurd part of their you know ideologies in order to make
[03:52:40.080 --> 03:52:44.480]  them question themselves is this really how i feel do i really sound this dumb so i try to be the
[03:52:44.480 --> 03:52:49.600]  opposite of the villain i try to be their superhero but their gay trans superhero that makes them all
[03:52:49.600 --> 03:52:53.600]  feel like they're stupid and need to actually you know maybe do some self-reflection on some of their
[03:52:53.600 --> 03:53:02.880]  decisions so trump's still on his way from the courthouse i'm assuming to his golden penthouse
[03:53:02.880 --> 03:53:08.640]  in uh trump tower much better than a in a rotting stinking jail cell oh he's going i'm
[03:53:08.640 --> 03:53:14.240]  sorry guys in my ear what was that is he going to the airport is that what we're being told
[03:53:15.680 --> 03:53:19.600]  i think he's on his way to florida yeah so he's going you're right you're right he's going to
[03:53:19.600 --> 03:53:22.960]  the airport now he's going to go down to florida he's going to have a press conference we'll be
[03:53:22.960 --> 03:53:27.680]  carrying that live right here at band out video so just following the motorcade heading towards
[03:53:27.680 --> 03:53:34.480]  the airport now but yeah uh the last number i saw alex was eight million dollars has been raised by
[03:53:34.480 --> 03:53:39.360]  donald trump's campaign since the indictment or or since the news of the indictment dropped i
[03:53:39.360 --> 03:53:45.520]  believe it was last thursday eight million dollars uh you know not bad not bad i guess this is
[03:53:45.520 --> 03:53:50.160]  definitely working uh in trump's favor as far as that's concerned but you know what else is
[03:53:50.160 --> 03:53:58.480]  amazing about this alex is the attention on donald trump is like i don't know a thousand
[03:53:58.480 --> 03:54:02.640]  times the attention on joe biden a hundred thousand times a million times i mean it just
[03:54:02.640 --> 03:54:08.480]  shows you who the real president is nobody gives a damn that joe biden is napping uh you know 20
[03:54:08.480 --> 03:54:13.120]  hours of the day or whatever or they have to lure him to work with an ice cream cone and a kid holding
[03:54:13.120 --> 03:54:19.680]  it yeah nobody's talking about biden because he's irrelevant well let's put on our tinfoil hats we
[03:54:19.760 --> 03:54:24.560]  are on info wars let's go full conspiracy mode now we have the trans put it on we have the
[03:54:24.560 --> 03:54:30.480]  transgender shooter is dominating the news now we have transgender awareness week where basically
[03:54:30.480 --> 03:54:34.800]  all of the people that are just so pro progressivism and so pro social justice
[03:54:35.360 --> 03:54:40.480]  all the all everything they stand for became a school shooter like literally the whole embodiment
[03:54:40.480 --> 03:54:45.120]  of the trans movement a person that the media can't even label correctly they don't know whether
[03:54:45.120 --> 03:54:49.920]  to call them their boy name or their girl name but this is like who they love the trans community
[03:54:49.920 --> 03:54:54.320]  and they go and they kill six people they kill three kids they kill three adults in a school and
[03:54:54.320 --> 03:54:57.840]  they want to try to take away your guns because of that so that's dominating the news and it's
[03:54:57.840 --> 03:55:01.760]  making everybody on the right look correct and we say oh there's a serious mental health issue
[03:55:01.760 --> 03:55:07.920]  with a lot of these transgender people so as soon as all that blows up conveniently they even though
[03:55:07.920 --> 03:55:12.080]  even though right before they announced that they were going to indict trump they said that they
[03:55:12.080 --> 03:55:15.520]  were weren't going to reconvene for a month and that it's probably going to be a month later
[03:55:15.520 --> 03:55:20.800]  so i just think it's very unusual timing and just like you said nobody's talking about joe biden
[03:55:20.800 --> 03:55:25.040]  all we're talking about is donald trump so they're doing this to distract us from what we
[03:55:25.040 --> 03:55:29.520]  really should be paying attention to yeah and then there's no doubt that this is a major moment in
[03:55:29.520 --> 03:55:35.440]  american history it is a huge story the political persecution uh you know most people i think are
[03:55:35.440 --> 03:55:39.760]  starting to understand that but what are we missing we're missing all the damage being
[03:55:39.760 --> 03:55:46.000]  done right now by this biden administration i mean the big story here is that the entire
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:50.960]  world has basically moved on from the united states i don't know how else to put this all
[03:55:50.960 --> 03:55:54.800]  these foreign countries are no longer dealing in the u.s dollar that's what kept it strong
[03:55:54.800 --> 03:56:00.480]  uh the petro dollar collapsing we don't even make oil anymore so now opec is in complete control
[03:56:00.480 --> 03:56:06.080]  of you know most of the energy production and distribution when it comes to when it comes to gas
[03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:11.680]  and even japan has now said okay well i mean joe biden is asleep i can't even get a hold of him
[03:56:11.680 --> 03:56:16.800]  so i guess we're going to start to work with china and india now too i mean japan japan folks
[03:56:16.800 --> 03:56:21.040]  if we lose japan i'm telling you we're done we'll lose them all we'll have no allies left
[03:56:22.640 --> 03:56:27.600]  yeah but owen do you have any faith if we could win a war i mean we lost to that we lost to the
[03:56:27.600 --> 03:56:33.440]  literal taliban all they had were toyota tocomas and old weapons that we gave them i mean i guess
[03:56:33.440 --> 03:56:40.160]  that's true i guess it'll stop the war because biden will have no support we'll just have to
[03:56:40.160 --> 03:56:45.920]  surrender we'll just say oh we surrender i mean i listen american greatness is it's almost like
[03:56:45.920 --> 03:56:50.720]  an afterthought now they actually want to have this country where the 45th president is somebody
[03:56:50.720 --> 03:56:56.160]  that's beloved by the majority of americans and now they give them a perp walk so that the whole
[03:56:56.160 --> 03:57:01.440]  entire world has a negative reflection of america so you're right this only weakens us you would you
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:05.600]  would want to protect the people that are the most powerful and important people quote unquote
[03:57:05.600 --> 03:57:09.600]  most important people in our country yes they shouldn't you know there shouldn't be rules for
[03:57:09.600 --> 03:57:14.720]  thee and not for me but honestly if you're the president of the united states we should have
[03:57:14.720 --> 03:57:19.920]  some sort of decorum and respect for our country by not charging him with a misdemeanor so this is
[03:57:19.920 --> 03:57:25.840]  just you know the self-destruction of a once great nation alex stein he's a pimp on a blimp
[03:57:25.840 --> 03:57:30.960]  and you'll be on a blimp live tonight on blaze tv yes and i'll be talking to you later we got
