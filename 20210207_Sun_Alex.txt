[00:30.000 --> 00:41.640]  My friends, thank you for joining us, it is Super Bowl 55, February 7th, 2021, on this
[00:41.640 --> 00:45.740]  live Sunday edition, and we're going to be here live for the next two hours and Owen
[00:45.740 --> 00:52.080]  Schreuer is coming in during the Super Bowl, Sacrilegious, to cover the globalist takeover
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.420]  of planet Earth and how to fight back because as much as I like football, as much as I like
[00:57.420 --> 01:02.720]  watching Tom Brady, it really pales in significance compared to the information we're going to
[01:02.720 --> 01:05.040]  be covering here.
[01:05.040 --> 01:10.240]  So when other people zig, we zag, we really appreciate the audience that tunes in, it's
[01:10.240 --> 01:15.080]  become quite a ritual, I've been on there 27 years, but I have been hosting a Sunday
[01:15.080 --> 01:26.440]  show for what is it, 12 years now at least, 4 to 6 p.m. central, so I'm basically always
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.240]  here during the Super Bowl.
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.640]  And the pleasure of it is, I don't have to see all of the anti-God, anti-family, anti-male,
[01:33.640 --> 01:40.360]  anti-female, anti-second amendment, anti-freedom messages that are in the ads.
[01:40.360 --> 01:45.040]  And I a lot of times watch the end of the game with the highlights, but I do literally
[01:45.040 --> 01:49.640]  change the channel as soon as it goes to an ad, but there's so much globalist propaganda
[01:49.640 --> 01:52.840]  within it, how do you watch it?
[01:52.840 --> 01:58.800]  But we will chronicle all of that, okay, wow, the quickening is here, there's so much
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.800]  to cover.
[01:59.800 --> 02:05.920]  The President's trial starts tomorrow, and I've been saying you should do this, and
[02:05.920 --> 02:11.000]  now they're saying he is, it's common sense, I'm sure they didn't get this from me, Trump
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  lawyers to use videos of Democrats inciting violence during impeachment, defense.
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.840]  That is a one-on-one deal.
[02:19.840 --> 02:23.720]  The first group out of what, North Carolina, he just fired two weeks ago, the media said
[02:23.720 --> 02:27.560]  quit, they didn't want to go there.
[02:27.560 --> 02:35.360]  No, that's exactly what you do, you put your accusers who are the real criminals on trial.
[02:35.360 --> 02:39.120]  Because most of the time that's what you get with a kangaroo court state prosecution like
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.840]  this is total projection.
[02:43.840 --> 02:49.240]  And we've got a lot of inside baseball in the second hour, Ali Alexander, who did help
[02:49.240 --> 02:53.440]  organize the big Trump events on the 5th and 6th.
[02:53.440 --> 02:59.320]  The media has said $100,000 bounties on his head, he's a terrorist, he's a criminal.
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.480]  Well, he's been getting his ducks in a row doing all the research on who was behind this.
[03:03.480 --> 03:08.440]  He's now ready to break the news, and I concur with his analysis in the second hour of how
[03:08.440 --> 03:13.280]  Trump was betrayed, how America was betrayed, and how what we had set and planned was not
[03:13.280 --> 03:19.320]  executed by folks at the White House, we know who was actually behind it.
[03:19.320 --> 03:22.560]  And sadly, the higher-ups of the Secret Service went along with it as well.
[03:22.560 --> 03:24.440]  So it's very, very sad.
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.520]  No most of the Secret Service are good men and women, but this is a setup of the president,
[03:28.520 --> 03:29.520]  very, very sick.
[03:29.520 --> 03:36.120]  And by the way, we already knew this a week ago, but the secret history of the shadow
[03:36.120 --> 03:43.200]  campaign that saved 2020 election, it is a lengthy 25-page article in Time Magazine
[03:43.200 --> 03:51.520]  that's about 80% accurate, admitting that powerful multinational banks and corporations
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.040]  in big tech working with a shadow army of leftists basically stole the election, they
[03:56.040 --> 04:02.880]  even call it a cabal, because they want to throw it in your face what they did, and they
[04:02.880 --> 04:06.640]  want the credit for what they carried out, and it's really got a lot of Democrats mad,
[04:06.640 --> 04:11.080]  like you're not supposed to tell people what we did, and even about censoring and not
[04:11.080 --> 04:15.880]  letting people expose the fraud or the election fraud, and how important that was to control
[04:15.880 --> 04:21.800]  the flow of information, and how they did a great job censoring over 100 million Americans.
[04:21.800 --> 04:25.000]  They are very proud of their activities.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.880]  They said it's not a paranoid fever dream, it's a well-funded cabal of powerful people
[04:29.880 --> 04:34.120]  ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence
[04:34.120 --> 04:40.520]  perception, change, rules and laws, steer media, control information, censor, it's all there.
[04:40.520 --> 04:44.640]  And it ties in, they even talk about the sixth and how they let us into a trap.
[04:44.640 --> 04:51.800]  Oh yeah, they're bragging, supervillains always do, they brag how they let us right into
[04:51.800 --> 04:59.520]  the trap, they're so proud of themselves, they're gloating.
[04:59.520 --> 05:05.400]  Finally we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio
[05:05.400 --> 05:12.360]  ads saying, everybody take your vitamin D3, take your zinc and take your C, it's essential
[05:12.360 --> 05:17.080]  for your body cells to maintain your health, essential means you must have it.
[05:17.080 --> 05:23.560]  It's been sold out for months, it's winter sun, it's back in stock with vitamin K, both

[06:13.880 --> 06:25.760]  In the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones, well, well, well, we've
[06:25.760 --> 06:33.600]  got a big game going on, simulated warfare from back in the days of the gladiators, bread
[06:33.600 --> 06:42.760]  and circus, Super Bowl 55, and I've always been a football fan, but so much propaganda
[06:42.760 --> 06:49.080]  involved with it, so much brainwashing, so much BLM communist garbage that I don't watch
[06:49.080 --> 06:53.560]  a lot of football, but tonight's the type of game I would watch because they want Mr.
[06:53.560 --> 07:01.640]  Brady to fail, it's like a rollerball, which was set in the year 2020, but this is 2021
[07:01.640 --> 07:08.880]  actually coming true, February 7th, 2021 on this Sunday, Super Bowl 55, Sunday Live, Super
[07:08.880 --> 07:15.720]  Bowl 55 is a giant pedophile sex trafficking party and MSM loves it, I'm going to play
[07:15.720 --> 07:22.880]  some of those clips, mainstream news, SNL making big jokes about all the pedophilia
[07:22.880 --> 07:32.960]  at the Super Bowl, even though I was briefed by folks in federal law enforcement and the
[07:32.960 --> 07:39.440]  Pentagon when they were having the Super Bowl in Houston, about how they were even running
[07:39.440 --> 07:47.240]  small children and kidnapped women and who was involved in it to my incredible disgust
[07:47.240 --> 07:53.360]  as I was being filled in on some people that I thought were nice people, actually weren't
[07:53.360 --> 07:59.960]  nice people, and how they literally have these pimps with whole hotel levels, whole floors
[07:59.960 --> 08:07.800]  blocked off with whatever you want, women, men, underage girls, boys, little kids.
[08:07.800 --> 08:13.640]  The Super Bowl is the number one largest human trafficking operation other than the Olympics
[08:13.640 --> 08:23.400]  in the world, but it's up there at the top with the World Cup and soccer and of course
[08:23.400 --> 08:26.440]  the Olympics and then the Super Bowl, they're there, they're all right up there at the top,
[08:26.440 --> 08:33.840]  but it doesn't matter why the Democrats say pedophilia doesn't exist, sex trafficking
[08:33.840 --> 08:38.520]  doesn't exist, it's all made up, it's the thing Q made up, nobody ever heard of this
[08:38.520 --> 08:42.440]  till three years ago when Q showed up and was the master of ceremonies about it all
[08:42.440 --> 08:50.800]  and put out this info to protect the perpetrators, that's right the perpetrators are Q.
[08:50.800 --> 09:01.680]  The Huffington Post though tries to spin it, oh, it's a myth, there's no sex trafficking
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.880]  at the Super Bowl, no, no, no, I'm gonna show you the documents, I'm gonna show you the
[09:06.880 --> 09:11.480]  proof, I'm gonna show you the court admissions and I'm gonna show you next segment, SNL making
[09:11.480 --> 09:21.280]  a big fat joke about it and they even tie me into it, but I've been around the block
[09:21.280 --> 09:30.360]  a few times and I figured out how all this operates and just how sick it is, so that's
[09:30.360 --> 09:37.360]  all coming up, let me tell you some of the other big news, we have the Massachusetts
[09:37.360 --> 09:43.680]  climate czar that works directly for John Kerry, says the quiet part out loud in private
[09:43.680 --> 09:47.880]  meeting we have the video, he says they're gonna break the American people's will, close
[09:47.880 --> 09:53.040]  quote, including the old retiree down the street, they're not gonna stop till you're
[09:53.040 --> 09:58.280]  in a 200 square foot coffin apartment, we actually have their plan, we actually have
[09:58.280 --> 10:04.560]  video of the coffin apartments already being put in place in the U.S. and the rest of the
[10:04.560 --> 10:10.720]  country, that's coming up, you're gonna see that for yourself and their master plan and
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.000]  we've got this interesting headline that's actually not really accurate and I'm not
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.240]  knocking input wars my own site, they just kind of rewrote what the mainstream media
[10:19.240 --> 10:24.400]  was saying, Supreme Court orders California to allow indoor church services and technically
[10:24.400 --> 10:29.760]  that's a true headline, I'm not bashing my own folks, it's true, technically you can
[10:29.760 --> 10:33.600]  call it a win, it's like we're only gonna chop your legs off and let you bleed to death,
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.960]  we're not gonna shoot you in the head, so your death will be long and painful, they
[10:37.960 --> 10:46.400]  say oh you can have 25% capacity and the state can still control you and inspect you, funny,
[10:46.400 --> 10:52.640]  there's something called the First Amendment and I've read also what the Founders said
[10:52.640 --> 10:57.400]  about it but it's very easy to interpret, the low grade moron could, Congress shall
[10:57.400 --> 11:03.960]  make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.000]  thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people to
[11:08.000 --> 11:16.280]  peaceably assemble and to perform and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[11:16.280 --> 11:21.040]  So there's a lot of things there to unpack but it's very simple, Congress has no jurisdiction
[11:21.040 --> 11:25.080]  over religion, it can make no law, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
[11:25.080 --> 11:31.160]  of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[11:31.160 --> 11:37.840]  Congress shall make no law, no law, no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.240]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof and it was, they had debates about it so this
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.880]  being a certain states will try to say one's Protestant, one's Catholic, one's this, one's
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.720]  that, one's Masonic, we're not gonna allow that, no state or the federal government
[11:50.720 --> 11:54.520]  can have any jurisdiction over religion, that's how Hopi Indians and people can take
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.400]  mescaline and the FBI can't stop them because it's been part of their religion for thousands
[11:58.400 --> 12:00.240]  of years.
[12:00.240 --> 12:03.040]  That's how different religious groups can butcher a goat in their backyard, everybody
[12:03.040 --> 12:08.160]  gets pissed off and when the Satanists do it or when the Muslims do it, it's their religion.
[12:08.160 --> 12:12.720]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[12:12.720 --> 12:15.720]  thereof.
[12:15.720 --> 12:22.000]  The Supreme Court said, oh no, you can restrict it heavily, you just can't totally ban it
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.320]  so you can have free speech, maybe at the bottom of a mineshaft with a thousand tons
[12:27.320 --> 12:33.840]  of concrete poured on top of you and you can scream at the walls in your four by eight
[12:33.840 --> 12:35.720]  cell fraternity.
[12:35.720 --> 12:44.520]  You have free speech at the bottom of a black hole and the same Supreme Court, you better
[12:44.520 --> 12:51.240]  bet set to rule that big tech can monitor you, track you, algorithm you, block you, punish
[12:51.240 --> 12:57.560]  you because this is an authoritarian move by the establishment to protect themselves
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.280]  because most of them have been caught up in sex crimes because that's how you get into
[13:02.280 --> 13:07.720]  the establishment and they're blackmailed by the globalists and the chikoms and the
[13:07.720 --> 13:15.800]  EU and they're just following orders and they're scared as hell but they're moving forward.
[13:15.800 --> 13:19.360]  So we know who the pedophiles are and who they aren't, look at who voted to ban the
[13:19.360 --> 13:24.520]  First Amendment in the name of defending it and then look at who didn't because this
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.800]  is a pedophile army we're up against.
[13:26.800 --> 13:31.400]  So that's some of the news, got a bunch of other COVID-19 news I haven't hit that we're
[13:31.400 --> 13:37.040]  going to be breaking down here and the new federal law enforcement moves to come after
[13:37.040 --> 13:40.480]  you make sure you're wearing the right type and everything else, told you the mask never
[13:40.480 --> 13:45.480]  come off until you start saying no.
[13:45.480 --> 13:51.920]  We have a lot of other really important news about the trial of the president starting
[13:51.920 --> 13:56.040]  tomorrow but the first big thing I want to get to speaking of the president's trial is
[13:56.040 --> 13:58.320]  Antifa.
[13:58.320 --> 14:05.080]  In Portland, in Seattle, in DC and a whole bunch of other places they threw mall off cocktails,
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.960]  they threw fireworks at police, they knocked out windows, they attacked people, they ransacked
[14:09.960 --> 14:16.440]  businesses and they screamed, they screamed, burn down DC, they said, give us what we want
[14:16.440 --> 14:25.400]  and we're going to burn it, start rolling the tape.
[14:25.400 --> 14:48.680]  They say if we don't get it, we're going to burn it down and then they throw fireworks,
[14:48.680 --> 14:55.360]  those heavy mortar rounds that blow people's hands and arms off all the time, high explosives,
[14:55.360 --> 15:04.280]  at the police and they began to throw them all off cocktails and all it is is just a
[15:04.280 --> 15:11.840]  bunch of meth head goons out attacking their own governments that are incubating them and
[15:11.840 --> 15:17.360]  putting them in a holding pattern so that any time they want they can then release them
[15:17.360 --> 15:20.520]  on the federal government, state government, whoever they want and by the way where is
[15:20.520 --> 15:21.520]  all that?
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.320]  This is a secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election, a 25 page article
[15:26.320 --> 15:31.680]  in Time magazine detailing how a shadowy international cabal stole the election from
[15:31.680 --> 15:36.120]  Trump and had an army ready to burn down DC and order to but instead they ordered to
[15:36.120 --> 15:45.200]  stand down on the 6th to set us up, oh they're just admitting to their crimes openly because
[15:45.200 --> 15:50.400]  master criminals always have to brag, they always have to gloat, that's not just in
[15:50.400 --> 15:54.680]  cartoons or Marvel comics where the master villain gloats, they actually do that in the
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.560]  real world.
[15:58.560 --> 16:04.720]  I sell supplements for two reasons because they work, they're real, they're powerful
[16:04.720 --> 16:09.680]  and because it's a giant market but again why is there a giant market?
[16:09.680 --> 16:14.640]  Because it works, that's why it exponentially grows so whether it's saw palm meadow and
[16:14.640 --> 16:22.720]  other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostate guard or whether it is the super
[16:22.720 --> 16:28.760]  high grade organic vitamin B12 and ultra 12 or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in
[16:28.760 --> 16:36.280]  DNA force or the pure deep breath crystal iodine X2, these are all the very best supplements
[16:36.280 --> 16:41.920]  you're going to find in an already great market of high quality products out there and it
[16:41.920 --> 16:45.960]  funds the M4WAR. So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're

[17:49.240 --> 17:52.680]  that's pretty much everybody who gives it 5 stars, so maybe 1 or 2 people, Patriot blend

[19:05.400 --> 19:12.560]  destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing, all of you that have served Satan believe
[19:12.560 --> 19:18.400]  that you are on the right team, you're about to find out how pathetic you are, so I ask

[19:34.160 --> 19:39.760]  we sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it, we should, but once
[19:39.760 --> 19:45.320]  it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[19:45.320 --> 19:51.840]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it, so prepare yourselves America, you're
[19:51.840 --> 19:57.160]  going under judge by just like all the children that were aborted, this is the truth, this
[19:57.160 --> 20:25.800]  is the info war, you're listening to the alex jones show,
[20:25.800 --> 20:39.120]  there are many underground currencies, art, drugs, gold, silver, ways to transfer wealth
[20:39.120 --> 20:46.960]  illicitly and one of the biggest is the sex trade and what's known as white slavery, now
[20:46.960 --> 20:50.880]  white slavery doesn't mean that white people are the slaves, it means white slavery is
[20:50.880 --> 20:57.920]  associated with the sex trade, meaning you've got black magic, white magic, it's just called
[20:57.920 --> 21:03.760]  white slavery, meaning the harams of the muslims were the women are held captive, they really
[21:03.760 --> 21:09.880]  kind of wrote the book on that in the last couple thousand years and so this has become
[21:09.880 --> 21:15.800]  a currency traded in all over the world and it's way to actually corrupt people and get
[21:15.800 --> 21:20.520]  them into gang initiations, MS 13 puts people through these type of initiations to rape
[21:20.520 --> 21:25.480]  a young girl or torture her or even kill her and look that up, you've tuned into the alex
[21:25.480 --> 21:32.840]  jones show on this live February 7th, Sunday Transmission, so there's a lot of media jokes
[21:32.840 --> 21:38.440]  about children and abusing children and you've seen the drag queen story times where men
[21:38.440 --> 21:42.680]  dressed as nuns say we're grooming the next generation of your children, your children
[21:42.680 --> 21:47.440]  belong to us, whether you like it or not and they even go to city councils with their
[21:47.440 --> 21:54.200]  makeup off and say we're grooming your children for the future, this is a power grab, that's
[21:54.200 --> 21:59.320]  what the whole trans movement is about, brainwashing autistic boys and they're really a girl, so
[21:59.320 --> 22:03.680]  you're really sterilizing people for depopulation and by the way that's in the literature from
[22:03.680 --> 22:12.360]  the 60s, they plan this, so they know what they're doing, well now SNL did a whole eight
[22:12.360 --> 22:18.320]  minute piece and only played part of it, Super Bowl commercials featured BLM, QAnon and COVID
[22:18.320 --> 22:29.480]  vaccines and they make jokes about Papa John, not Papa John's pizza but Papa John and then
[22:29.480 --> 22:38.480]  they talk about sex slavery and Hillary and pizza, so let's unpack that, we got the Wiki
[22:38.480 --> 22:46.640]  leaks documents about two months before the election in 2016 and it was real, they didn't
[22:46.640 --> 22:53.080]  deny it and it was John Podesta and Hillary and others at Obama and that sir $65,000 of
[22:53.080 --> 22:58.040]  hot dogs will be delivered to your party, for Obama's credit that's not children, that's
[22:58.040 --> 23:02.680]  male prostitutes in the FBI code, that's a known code that the FBI has created handbooks
[23:02.680 --> 23:10.760]  on, but with the Clintons and with John Podesta, his brother publishes that he likes pedophilia
[23:10.760 --> 23:16.400]  in the Washington Post, 2007, I mean quote DV and art, I don't even want to show it,
[23:16.400 --> 23:20.400]  even though we have a lot of stations complaining, TV stations, the simulcast, the radio show,
[23:20.400 --> 23:26.560]  but you can look up John Podesta, Tony Podesta, DV and art and it ties all into the spirit
[23:26.560 --> 23:29.320]  cooking and the rest of it and it talks about we're going to have children in the hot tub
[23:29.320 --> 23:33.800]  for you, they're ready to service you, they're going to make this remote farmhouse for you,
[23:33.800 --> 23:40.680]  that was all in New York and places like that, so seeing in the New York Times go oh my gosh,
[23:40.680 --> 23:45.640]  QAnon or it wasn't called that then it was called 4chan, they have all found where it
[23:45.640 --> 23:53.240]  said at a pizza place in DC in a underground bunker, none of that was true, we covered
[23:53.240 --> 23:58.400]  the news covering it, they went oh Jones says it's there, so see they distracted off of
[23:58.400 --> 24:04.360]  all the real stuff, all right parental discretion advised, pull up Tony Podesta, DV and art,
[24:04.360 --> 24:09.000]  Washington Post, just don't put the naked kids on screen, they put this in the newspaper,
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.600]  that was in 2007, see that's a lesser magic, if they show you what they're doing, go ahead
[24:13.600 --> 24:17.600]  and show the paddled kids, the chained up kids, just don't show the naked ones, and
[24:17.600 --> 24:23.120]  so it's a lesser magic to show you all this, it throws it in your face and gives them more
[24:23.120 --> 24:28.480]  power they believe to be conditioning you, and so again what they're doing with this
[24:28.480 --> 24:32.520]  is throwing it in your face, so they diverted off onto a pizza place that nothing was going
[24:32.520 --> 24:38.160]  on at, but the Podestas were involved and did go there for fundraisers and things, so
[24:38.160 --> 24:41.960]  there was enough of a connection to then divert off of everything else that was really going
[24:41.960 --> 24:48.760]  on, and so now they make a joke about it, but I'm going to play you this SNL joke and
[24:48.760 --> 24:52.800]  good job that they're showing it but not showing the naked children, they've cut that
[24:52.800 --> 24:56.880]  off, and there's hundreds of these ladies and gentlemen, this was published in Washington
[24:56.880 --> 25:03.160]  Post, and I mean, looking at this I feel degraded, my soul feels bad, I mean it's, it's, he
[25:03.160 --> 25:09.000]  has a dungeon, and there's images of children hanging basically off hooks, and just stuff
[25:09.000 --> 25:17.120]  you can't even imagine, or he watches deviant art, and it's all children tied up, and I'm
[25:17.120 --> 25:23.480]  going to leave it at that, so again, you have the Clintons and the UN history, and you have
[25:23.480 --> 25:30.320]  the demons with children in cages on their backs, it's just unbelievable, I've forgotten
[25:30.320 --> 25:35.600]  more than most people even know about this stuff, and you have the UN's own report, you
[25:35.600 --> 25:40.720]  have the AP three years ago that Hillary helped traffic over 10,000 kidnapped children out
[25:40.720 --> 25:45.760]  of Haiti, many ended up in sex dungeons and dead, I'm going to show you Hillary involved
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.960]  in all this, and Obama not doing it himself, but helping deliver children when we come
[25:50.960 --> 25:56.240]  back, I'm going to show you the Washington Post and a Senate report that Obama facilitated
[25:56.240 --> 26:01.840]  the trafficking of tens of thousands of children in sex slavery, but I'm honest, he doesn't
[26:01.840 --> 26:07.080]  order him up himself, he likes dudes, but I mean look at his husband, but that's what's
[26:07.080 --> 26:12.080]  going on here, Big Mike, who by the way is a man, all the evidence is overwhelming, so
[26:12.080 --> 26:19.200]  SNL Super Bowl commercial features, BLM, QAnon and COVID vaccines, all making jokes about
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.640]  it, but when we come back, because it shows a horse kicking a vaccine or somebody, yeah,
[26:23.640 --> 26:27.840]  it's going to be like a horse kicking your ass, so let's go ahead and roll them, making
[26:27.840 --> 26:33.920]  a joke about what is one of the top sex trade, sex exploitation, sex slavery events in the
[26:33.920 --> 26:39.640]  world, here it is, moment in history, you'll see impassioned commercials, this one almost
[26:39.640 --> 26:46.560]  brought me to tears, in these times what you stand for matters more than ever, we've learned
[26:46.560 --> 26:53.880]  once again that freedom isn't free, but we must always strive for equality, and we must
[26:53.880 --> 27:06.920]  always reach for cheez-its, cheez-its historically delicious, wow truly inspiring, what the hell,
[27:06.920 --> 27:14.080]  that was a commercial for cheez-its, really makes you think, right boom, but look don't
[27:14.080 --> 27:18.680]  worry, to balance out the so-called progressive ads, we're also wearing some with a more
[27:18.680 --> 27:25.200]  conservative slant like this one, had Papa Johns, we know you want real ingredients,
[27:25.200 --> 27:32.320]  no additives, no preservatives, and no child sex trafficking in the basement, sorry Democrats,
[27:32.320 --> 27:40.240]  you'll have to get your child sex pizza over at Hilary's Pizzeria, Papa Johns, it's A-okay,
[27:40.240 --> 27:49.280]  step by with your coupon today, wait that's a pizza, so imagine you've got 70 million
[27:49.280 --> 27:52.200]  people probably chewing into the Super Bowl, you've got all these children hearing about
[27:52.200 --> 27:59.160]  sex with children, and conservatives, and then the cue movement, and it shows cue supporters,
[27:59.160 --> 28:03.960]  again I told you cue is a discredit, and say there's millions of kids in underground bases,
[28:03.960 --> 28:07.200]  which isn't true, so that all the real stuff I'm going to show you when we come back doesn't
[28:07.200 --> 28:12.600]  get looked at, you could never get cue, hey here's 30,000 children in a sex slave system
[28:12.600 --> 28:18.400]  run by the German government, you're not cue level buddy, oh here's Trump busting thousands
[28:18.400 --> 28:25.400]  of these groups, because it was controlled by them, and I knew it was, so now they can
[28:25.400 --> 28:31.360]  have a victory laugh and try to discredit all of this stuff, victory laugh, victory laugh,
[28:31.360 --> 28:36.840]  when we come back I'm going to just show you this week's news about the giant industrial
[28:36.840 --> 28:41.840]  government run sex slave operations of Obama, the Democrats, and the German government,
[28:41.840 --> 28:46.280]  the Germans are some of the worst, the communists that run that, Merkel, oh that's a pedophile
[28:46.280 --> 28:58.120]  army, I mean the German government is pedophile devil worshipers, we'll be right back.
[28:58.120 --> 29:03.720]  So many people say to me, Alex please stop being so negative, well for me admitting I've
[29:03.720 --> 29:09.960]  gotten a rotten tooth, and going in a root canal is not negative, it hurts, it stinks,
[29:09.960 --> 29:13.640]  it's got pus coming out of it, I go to the doctor they fix it, that's not negative, I'm
[29:13.640 --> 29:19.200]  not living in denial, and so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't
[29:19.200 --> 29:24.160]  feel yet, but now it's come to the surface, that's actually a positive thing, and so yeah
[29:24.160 --> 29:29.000]  Trump did an overall great job, they stole the election, we can't get down about that,
[29:29.000 --> 29:35.080]  we have forced them out in the open, so now they're trying to suppress us because they
[29:35.080 --> 29:39.000]  know they've been exposed, they're scared, that's why instead of saying oh we're a bunch
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.480]  of losers, look what happened, no we're a bunch of winners, they're trying to suppress
[29:42.480 --> 29:47.880]  us, let our light of truth shine, and tell everybody what's happening, your own website,
[29:47.880 --> 29:52.920]  your own show, my show, other articles, other videos, just keep sharing however you can and
[29:52.920 --> 29:56.600]  realize we're in an information war, we're going to win this together, and the fight
[29:56.600 --> 29:58.720]  starts at infowords.com.
[29:58.720 --> 30:03.720]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[30:03.720 --> 30:06.920]  People ask me all the time they go Joe, are you on cocaine, are you on meth, how are you
[30:06.920 --> 30:07.920]  so excited?
[30:07.920 --> 30:14.720]  How do I not get excited about world government, force masks, force inoculations, open announcements
[30:14.720 --> 30:19.760]  that our country is going to be dissolved, I'm sorry, I'm a fighter, and I know many
[30:19.760 --> 30:24.040]  of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well, and so I'll just say this,
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.520]  I try to be calm, I try to be focused, and I don't know what I do, I wasn't still on
[30:28.520 --> 30:34.480]  air right now, but I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air, because you have
[30:34.480 --> 30:39.280]  to realize, when I tell you that you're the info war, that's not me patting on the head,
[30:39.280 --> 30:44.840]  you are 99% of the equation, so when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy
[30:44.840 --> 30:49.360]  the products, infowords.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce,
[30:49.360 --> 30:54.600]  it changes the world, so you are the info war, thank you so much for the fight, thank
[30:54.600 --> 30:59.080]  you for all you've done, now let's take action together and take down the globalist.
[30:59.080 --> 31:07.240]  In a world without free speech, imagine being buried alive, scratching at the coffin lid
[31:07.240 --> 31:12.280]  and no one hears you, you know that's where the term dead ringer comes from, going back
[31:12.280 --> 31:16.840]  to ancient England and France, maybe 5% of people on average, some of the numbers show
[31:16.840 --> 31:22.240]  even higher, would look like they were dead, sound like they were dead, and the primitive
[31:22.240 --> 31:26.960]  daughters of the time couldn't find a heartbeat, so they'd sit there and have a string down,
[31:26.960 --> 31:31.560]  tied to the finger of the person 6 feet under, so in case they woke up, they wouldn't be
[31:31.560 --> 31:38.560]  buried alive, so what I'm getting at here is this, America is still awake, America
[31:38.560 --> 31:43.880]  still is alive, but we're going to have to realize that we're under attack and that
[31:43.880 --> 31:48.720]  we've been basically buried alive if we have any chance to metaphysically with God self
[31:48.720 --> 31:52.920]  break out of it, we've got to call out to God to give us discernment and providence
[31:52.920 --> 31:57.160]  to get out of this and admit the globalists aren't trying to bury us alive in the lockdowns
[31:57.160 --> 31:58.920]  if we're ever going to turn this around.
[31:58.920 --> 32:04.920]  Finally, we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio
[32:04.920 --> 32:11.920]  ads saying everybody, take your vitamin D3, take your zinc and take your C, it's essential
[32:11.920 --> 32:16.760]  for your body cells to maintain your health, essential means you must have it, it's been

[33:01.760 --> 33:24.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, welcome back on this live Sunday, February 7th, 2021
[33:24.600 --> 33:32.800]  Jones Mission, super bold, 55, Ellen Schroyer is coming up, it's another two hours, six
[33:32.800 --> 33:38.100]  to 8PM as we all ride shotgun together into eternity.
[33:38.100 --> 33:43.860]  Okay, so I have been on there 27 years and I'd read a lot of books, I've studied a lot
[33:43.860 --> 33:47.600]  of history and learned a lot of stuff from interesting family but I was still dumbered
[33:47.600 --> 33:50.720]  to box the rocks, even though I was light years ahead of the average person of my age
[33:50.720 --> 33:59.460]  when I got on local access TV at 20 syndicated local radio at 21 syndicated at 22 I've interviewed
[33:59.460 --> 34:03.260]  thousands and thousands of people I've been on the street thousands of times I've experienced
[34:03.260 --> 34:11.120]  a lot of things and so there I am this is the best way to understand what happened because
[34:11.120 --> 34:14.820]  I experienced this you know they say there's three ways to learn things revelation where
[34:14.820 --> 34:20.040]  you just got beams in your head that's the best way experience that's the next best
[34:20.040 --> 34:28.280]  way or you have to be taught get be told let's see people don't tend to believe that if they're
[34:28.280 --> 34:35.440]  just told something or taught something they're not sure yet are they so there's revelation
[34:35.440 --> 34:41.440]  there's experience and there's being taught and so when I tell you these stories it's
[34:41.440 --> 34:45.120]  not to talk about something that happened in my life it's my only way to describe how
[34:45.120 --> 34:52.060]  I know I'm right so I'm sitting here four years and four months ago and we've got hundreds
[34:52.060 --> 34:56.160]  of thousands of emails I mean we're doing Alistair Crowley rituals it says we're drinking
[34:56.160 --> 35:03.280]  blood semen women's milk we correlate it with photos and Hillary and world leaders together
[35:03.280 --> 35:08.600]  with vats of blood with children in it and pin and just demons raping children and the
[35:08.600 --> 35:16.400]  Washington Post showing demons raping children I'm like what the hell is this I just showed
[35:16.400 --> 35:21.120]  you some of it and I didn't show you the bad stuff last segment of your TV viewer we stopped
[35:21.120 --> 35:29.040]  in Tony Podesta promoting child rape promoting pedophilia I mean it's just everywhere they
[35:29.040 --> 35:33.680]  have damn art displays and then my crew who are great people some of them are not here
[35:33.680 --> 35:41.440]  now they're like Jones this is the place this pizza place it's proof and I said you know
[35:41.440 --> 35:47.000]  the media is all covering it I think it's a setup and then of course it was so when
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.120]  I saw Q come along and like oh there's 10 million kids and underground bases and you
[35:53.120 --> 36:01.360]  know it but oh Hillary's in Gitmo and you know oh Tom Hanks is involved and he's in
[36:01.360 --> 36:04.840]  a he's in a prison I don't know Tom Hanks is involved in the stuff there's no proof
[36:04.840 --> 36:12.360]  of that and he wasn't in prison like when Trump got up on January 7th and said I can
[36:12.360 --> 36:23.240]  see the election a chance said that is a deep fake I was talking to Roger he was talking
[36:23.240 --> 36:28.680]  to Trump every day Trump had conceded I could call up another lawyer Barnes was talking
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.800]  to Trump still is every day and he's like no he conceded Trump has called me probably
[36:33.800 --> 36:40.040]  50 times but oh I'm a real person though don't listen to me don't listen to me listen to
[36:40.040 --> 36:50.120]  a Chan and some dude that looks like I don't know the psychic creature and total recall
[36:50.120 --> 37:00.120]  activate the reactor so here we are and then I get to see them rub it in everywhere calling
[37:00.120 --> 37:05.760]  Republicans the Q party calling me the Q oh Jones turned against Q I tried to get the
[37:05.760 --> 37:13.080]  Q people to listen to me so they wouldn't be set up and so when all this came out they
[37:13.080 --> 37:16.400]  would be on the right side of it a lot of people listening a lot didn't but but a lot
[37:16.400 --> 37:20.080]  of my listeners like we're sick of Q Alex we know it's a fraud I'm talking to the new
[37:20.080 --> 37:25.880]  people and I'm explaining that there's gonna be more of us to come so that's why I get
[37:25.880 --> 37:32.800]  so mad when I see shows like Saturday Night Live that's famous for promoting pedophilia
[37:32.800 --> 37:38.280]  making a joke about the sex traffic of children and Hillary and pizza because it's known it's
[37:38.280 --> 37:41.800]  in the FBI files we've checked it it's been in many court cases it's been confirmed they
[37:41.800 --> 37:46.320]  used like in the old days I guess if you're gonna order some marijuana over the phone
[37:46.320 --> 37:52.040]  you go I'd like some Mr. Green or you know people have a code word well cheese pizza
[37:52.040 --> 37:58.480]  means child pornography walnut sauce means brown children I'm not kidding and it's they
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.120]  got all these terms and that's all in the John Podesta Tony Podesta email stuff that's
[38:03.120 --> 38:07.000]  all confirmed well they didn't want us to look at that so they go set up a thing that
[38:07.000 --> 38:13.640]  wasn't doing anything to divert us off it's a very simple distraction tactic but now here

[41:53.200 --> 42:02.000]  Super Bowl oh senior establishment anti-trumper supports impeachment arrested for running
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.880]  pedophile ring he said he quote dreamed of gang raping babies and was organizing the
[42:07.880 --> 42:16.160]  rape of a baby to hear it scream his favorite oh here's another article when Chelsea handler
[42:16.160 --> 42:23.400]  met Woody Allen and soon ye at Jeffrey Epstein's dinner party oh soon ye oh his little girlfriend

[42:44.040 --> 42:48.560]  it understand it they and the Republicans are involved as well they are the most evil
[42:48.560 --> 42:59.640]  people you could ever imagine and they all got that demon look imagine a world without
[42:59.640 --> 43:08.800]  free speech imagine being buried alive scratching at the coffin lid and no one hears you you
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.600]  know that's where the term dead ringer comes from going back to ancient England France
[43:13.600 --> 43:17.840]  maybe five percent of people on average some of the numbers show even higher would look
[43:17.840 --> 43:22.720]  like they were dead sound like they were dead and the primitive daughters of the time couldn't
[43:22.720 --> 43:28.320]  find a heartbeat so they'd sit there have a string down tied to the finger of the person
[43:28.320 --> 43:33.920]  six feet under so in case they woke up they wouldn't be buried alive so what I'm getting
[43:33.920 --> 43:40.800]  at here is this America is still awake America still is alive but we're going to have to
[43:40.800 --> 43:46.280]  realize that we're under attack and we've been basically buried alive if we have any
[43:46.280 --> 43:50.960]  chance to metaphysically with God self-break out of it we've got a call out to God to
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.120]  give us discernment and Providence to get out of this and admit the globalist are trying
[43:55.120 --> 43:58.480]  to bury us alive in the lockdowns if we're ever going to turn this around look a lot
[43:58.480 --> 44:02.480]  of people got mad at me during the Q thing when I told you Trump was in trouble they
[44:02.480 --> 44:05.960]  were going to steal the election they said Jones were invincible everything's handled
[44:05.960 --> 44:10.920]  I get it we got the Super Bowl champion Trump he's invincible Jones stop being pessimistic
[44:10.920 --> 44:15.760]  we're on the winning team well I started out on air 27 years ago we were not the winning
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.600]  team when one out of a hundred people knew the Federal Reserve was private well almost
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.920]  no one knew about the globalist or Satanism or international pedophile rings or Bohemian
[44:23.920 --> 44:29.320]  grove or skull and bones so see I came from a time when nobody supported us I had to claw
[44:29.320 --> 44:34.880]  my way up and wake up the planet with your help and so when I got mad at Q singing people
[44:34.880 --> 44:38.680]  lullabies making them go to sleep I wasn't mad at you I just wanted you to understand
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.680]  that we had won the war yet so info wars is real we've been privy we're right and we're
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.600]  still on air fighting harder than ever but it's only your word of mouth about the local
[44:47.600 --> 44:51.640]  station you're listening to our TV station you're watching we're info wars.com or banned
[44:51.640 --> 44:58.800]  out video that circumvents the censors they want to censor us so don't let them do it
[44:58.800 --> 45:04.440]  look I've been harping on Q for the last few years not because the giant huge Q movement
[45:04.440 --> 45:09.480]  was competition my goodness I could have embraced Q and just my show would have been bigger
[45:09.480 --> 45:15.360]  than ever but I can't lie to you not consciously I make mistakes sometimes and I knew Q was
[45:15.360 --> 45:19.480]  controlled I knew was putting out false info it was covering real issues but giving fake
[45:19.480 --> 45:25.880]  dates telling you we were invincible and now we're here at 2021 and I just see so many
[45:25.880 --> 45:31.520]  people now that are still believing in some magic trick and that Trump's still president
[45:31.520 --> 45:35.240]  he's going to save us and that's just not the case we're going to have to save ourselves
[45:35.240 --> 45:39.880]  with God's help there's an old Beto and saying that trusted gov and Todrick Camel Hunter
[45:39.880 --> 45:44.760]  S. Thompson said pray to gov and Roy for the rocks and that's what info wars is about
[45:44.760 --> 45:48.600]  is admitting the truth there's a lot of positive things the world's waking to the new world
[45:48.600 --> 45:54.120]  order Q was in a tip to hijack our movement and it's failed now so now we know the truth
[45:54.120 --> 46:01.800]  and now we're getting ready to take action every product you hear me on air advertising
[46:01.800 --> 46:07.200]  we have in stock in our warehouse in Austin Texas every product so if you order it we've
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.720]  got it ships out in a couple days sometimes the same day let's just get confused when
[46:11.720 --> 46:16.080]  they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking down and its future
[46:16.080 --> 46:22.320]  orders its product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're having trouble with
[46:22.320 --> 46:28.400]  I mean I'm talking about double triple quadruple delivery times and it's across not just the
[46:28.400 --> 46:33.720]  supplement vitamin mineral industry it's across every industry so the globalists have successfully
[46:33.720 --> 46:39.680]  devastated the economy that's why I'm saying you need to visit infowarstore.com today again
[46:39.680 --> 46:44.600]  high quality stuff that's why you still can and storeable food at infowarstore.com because
[46:44.600 --> 46:49.080]  we have it in stock it's ready to ship but with the supply chain breakdowns prices are
[46:49.080 --> 46:54.160]  going up availability is going down and it's just crazy so please get products while you
[46:54.160 --> 47:20.200]  still can and support the infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:20.200 --> 47:28.000]  you are listening to an infowars.com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[47:28.000 --> 47:36.440]  you are the resistance by the way my parents growing up I'm your host Alex Jones had every
[47:36.440 --> 47:40.920]  room basically full of books but I was about 10 I was already into history books I was
[47:40.920 --> 47:46.120]  already just racially reading my dad was just taking me to the bookstore every weekend like
[47:46.120 --> 47:50.160]  into the library I could just have whatever I wanted they wouldn't buy a bunch of clothes
[47:50.160 --> 47:54.000]  wouldn't buy me a new bike they'd buy books and I'm like dad what are these books he goes
[47:54.000 --> 47:59.320]  oh those are books on black magic and what the establishment is into and how they try
[47:59.320 --> 48:02.880]  to harness their mind to control things for bad he said you can read them if you want
[48:02.880 --> 48:07.160]  to and these were like the really famous ones but like copies a lot of books don't have
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.240]  like the grand grimoire and all this I probably read 10 books on black magic by the time I
[48:11.240 --> 48:16.100]  was about 12 and so that's why I'm going to explain to you about Hillary Clinton and
[48:16.100 --> 48:20.760]  Alistair Crowley magic and all these people I mean it's 101 I mean I've actually studied
[48:20.760 --> 48:29.280]  it so I explain lesser magic I guess like these different organizations these different
[48:29.280 --> 48:38.480]  thug groups the insane clown posse all those type of groups they say we want to punk somebody
[48:38.480 --> 48:43.440]  and you know you see it in basic criminal psychology out there you got to tell somebody
[48:43.440 --> 48:48.080]  what you're doing to their face that makes it 10 times better and they believe it if
[48:48.080 --> 48:51.840]  they announce what they're going to do to you before they do it gives it more power when
[48:51.840 --> 49:02.880]  they do it okay and so that's what we're talking about right here and these people mean business
[49:02.880 --> 49:08.360]  so when you see Hollywood promoting Satanism and pedophilia and all of that depending on
[49:08.360 --> 49:16.440]  the statistics I've read upwards of 80 percent of pedophiles were abused themselves and so
[49:16.440 --> 49:26.520]  they're creating a system that's self-replicating and that's why you had the psychiatrist in
[49:26.520 --> 49:34.360]  every German state with the with the legislatures of the states the Senate's I just showed you
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.880]  daily beast even to their credit most liberal publications it doesn't exist I just showed
[49:39.880 --> 49:46.600]  you DW.com biggest TV station in Germany highly respected national news like ABC News saying
[49:46.600 --> 49:54.440]  every major German state place children knowingly with child rapist now why is that important
[49:54.440 --> 49:58.080]  the guys were telling me about a documentary I meant to see actually read about it a while
[49:58.080 --> 50:06.240]  back but never got to it the truth about three identical strangers psychology today now the
[50:06.240 --> 50:11.920]  psychiatrist and psychologist that convinced the mother to do a psychology experiment and
[50:11.920 --> 50:21.840]  split her three sons apart they even know you have three but I guess they do is that
[50:21.840 --> 50:28.480]  impossible and to study how they would grow up how they would behave how would operate
[50:28.480 --> 50:35.240]  and I think about that's just a psychiatrist making the decision to do that for a test
[50:35.240 --> 50:40.920]  and that's what Bill Gates is geoengineering is about that's what the mRNA vaccine is about
[50:40.920 --> 50:45.320]  that's what all this craziness is about is these groups are doing whatever they want
[50:45.320 --> 50:53.280]  whenever they want however they want and it's insane wow I just show that I don't know
[50:53.280 --> 50:58.320]  my science I didn't know you could have three identical twins wow I've heard about this I
[50:58.320 --> 51:03.720]  never saw the documentary that's crazy I can tell you a little bit on my watching list
[51:03.720 --> 51:10.960]  as soon as I can but again they split them up because the system felt like it well thank
[51:10.960 --> 51:18.440]  God the psychiatrist didn't decide to send him to live with pedophiles but that's how
[51:18.440 --> 51:23.320]  the scientists work not the average scientist but the elite scientist are mad scientist
[51:23.320 --> 51:29.160]  and you don't get in their ranks unless you treat people like they're absolutely nothing
[51:29.160 --> 51:32.760]  so I'm done talking about this I got a lot of other news to hit we have gigantic news
[51:32.760 --> 51:36.600]  we're gonna break about the Trump trial why it affects you and other trying to demonize
[51:36.600 --> 51:40.040]  the American people and demonize every Trump supporter at this trial and how you're on
[51:40.040 --> 51:49.920]  trial during all of this next hour and I've got some big mass rebellion news people standing
[51:49.920 --> 51:55.920]  up to COVID-19 overblown hoax as well here in just a moment that we're gonna be looking
[51:55.920 --> 52:01.800]  at in fact let's just start looking at this right now I saw a tweet about a news article
[52:01.800 --> 52:13.800]  yesterday with the left attacking Kristi Noem of the Dakotas the governor of South Dakota
[52:13.800 --> 52:19.240]  because she's got TV ads running saying take your vitamins that's what protects you and
[52:19.240 --> 52:31.400]  they go on to say that she is completely insane and that that's not the case so let's look
[52:31.400 --> 52:38.600]  at this she says that it's not even as bad as the regular cold of the flu which is true
[52:38.600 --> 52:43.840]  it's now you know point zero zero zero whatever she says her state has some of the lowest
[52:43.840 --> 52:47.480]  numbers because they haven't shuttered body inside their houses not getting vitamin D
[52:47.480 --> 52:54.040]  she's right and so she goes on and says people need to take their vitamins and their minerals
[52:54.040 --> 52:59.040]  they're essential meaning you die without them any virus will kill you if you're debilitated
[52:59.040 --> 53:05.160]  now let's see if she's right I just searched vitamin mineral deficiency COVID-19 this came
[53:05.160 --> 53:12.280]  up with first few Oregon live vitamin cd can help prevent coronavirus Oregon State University
[53:12.280 --> 53:18.800]  research says vitamin cd may help immune system fight COVID-19 yeah you die without it's
[53:18.800 --> 53:24.520]  a thing oxygen tank might help you while you're scuba diving gasly in your engine your car
[53:24.520 --> 53:29.560]  might make it start three vitamins minerals to boost your immune system to fight COVID
[53:29.560 --> 53:37.440]  news dot flu dot edu zinc vitamin D in the coronavirus what doctors know so far on and
[53:37.440 --> 53:42.400]  on and on so that's how crazy and the reason I first got on this was I'll cover this at
[53:42.400 --> 53:48.120]  the last segment of the next hour there's this top scientist max plane institute everything
[53:48.120 --> 53:52.440]  she came out six months ago and said I've looked at the mRNA vaccine it will cause an
[53:52.440 --> 53:57.200]  autoimmune response to the next coronavirus you get and is going to kill millions well
[53:57.200 --> 54:02.520]  that's what Wolfgang Wudarg the head of the EU advisory board said so she's asking I'll
[54:02.520 --> 54:07.960]  cover it next hour why are they doing this when it's so dangerous they know it's going
[54:07.960 --> 54:13.600]  to cause a storm like when you get stung by a bee after you already have an allergic response
[54:13.600 --> 54:20.480]  to it but like a hundred bee sting you she says why are they going to do this it's going
[54:20.480 --> 54:25.360]  to cause the Spanish flu level mass death I don't know you got to figure out what Gates
[54:25.360 --> 54:30.600]  and them are thinking because it's already happening people that take the shot and take
[54:30.600 --> 54:37.160]  the second shot get deathly ill many of them some died but then later people are dying
[54:37.160 --> 54:41.720]  and they're saying they died at COVID-19 because the COVID test counts all the coronaviruses
[54:41.720 --> 54:47.880]  so it's it's really true that it's the vaccine of its mRNA that does this scientist predicts
[54:47.880 --> 54:51.960]  mRNA vaccine will lead to numerous deaths months after injection she said it six months
[54:51.960 --> 54:57.440]  ago it's true and I saw Reuters do a fat check of her when she she's a prestigious scientist
[54:57.440 --> 55:03.120]  and one of the top you know out there and and they said well you know the UN says that's
[55:03.120 --> 55:11.080]  not official but I mean that's what it does she explains it does it causes an autoimmune
[55:11.080 --> 55:18.560]  response to a regular protein in the body that's also associated with cell death so
[55:18.560 --> 55:24.440]  as you get older and your cells die and don't divide you always have some dividing until
[55:24.440 --> 55:30.720]  you die but less and less do that's what aging is it releases the protein and then your body
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.920]  attacks that every time you will have an autoimmune response and basically have a horrible cold
[55:35.920 --> 55:42.360]  all the time wow and that's what everybody's saying it's in the damn literature so they're
[55:42.360 --> 55:47.680]  giving you a shot that will make you totally allergic like they used to grow some of the
[55:47.680 --> 55:51.800]  vaccine stuff on peanuts suddenly there was a huge problem peanuts they stopped doing
[55:51.800 --> 55:55.200]  it all the new kids getting it don't have a problem now they're going to give you an
[55:55.200 --> 56:04.360]  autoimmune response to the common cold a deadly one on the cytokine storm ladies and gentlemen
[56:04.360 --> 56:10.240]  I protect myself with things that are high quality and things that are essential we've

[58:00.560 --> 58:06.760]  house people have their doors kicked down this is all them trying to submit their dominance
[58:06.760 --> 58:14.800]  over us because they know humanity is waking up and is in the process of leaving one age
[58:14.800 --> 58:21.600]  this whole globalist time of evil and darkness and traveling not into some new satanic Luciferian
[58:21.600 --> 58:27.760]  new age that's perfect but into an age what I call challenge or the age of real conflict
[58:27.760 --> 58:32.840]  the age of decision I'm gonna read this stuff in books it comes from my soul my prayer my
[58:32.840 --> 58:37.080]  research my understanding of the planet you may disagree with me that's fine but I'm telling

[59:54.440 --> 1:00:13.200]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:18.960]  it's Alex Jones well you know I love Tucker Carlson he just does a great job I want to
[1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:24.480]  air a short report that ties into what I'm about to be covering with the admission that
[1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:31.060]  it was Obama's ethics are that's a funny name isn't it that led the color revolution
[1:00:31.060 --> 1:00:36.440]  behind the 2020 US election they've now bragged about their criminal activity it's like in
[1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:40.760]  good fellows when he kills the guy from behind the Cadillac he's like dude stop buying stuff
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:44.160]  we just stole ten million dollars I'm gonna kill you had to kill him he just had to get
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:47.640]  to brag about it and so that's how this all works here's the report
[1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:57.960]  that's tonight's new explains Sharon thanks so much for coming on so for our viewers
[1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:03.880]  who are not familiar with the color revolutions in Eastern Europe state as clearly as you
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:09.280]  can what you think is going on right now in this election what's the end game for democrats
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:17.560]  yes thank you for having me many have described the actions taken against Trump as a coup
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:23.200]  and this is certainly correct but it's a little bit general and vague what's unfolding before
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:29.560]  our eyes is a very specific type of coup called the color revolution it's a regime change
[1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:35.680]  model favored by many in our national security apparatus particularly against Eastern European
[1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:42.160]  countries to overthrow target regimes that they don't like one model which is not the
[1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:47.760]  color revolution model is purely sending a bunch of troops into a country and removing
[1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:53.160]  by military force a leader you don't like that's like the Iraq model right the color
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:58.680]  revolution model is a little bit more delicate and subtle has several characteristics but
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:05.480]  the chief characteristics of it is a combination of an engineered contested elections scenario
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:13.280]  combined with massive mobilized protests which they call as a term of art peaceful protests
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:20.240]  and acts of civil disobedience if that sounds familiar it gets even better it's not only
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:27.200]  the same strategies and tactics used against Trump that is used against Eastern European
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:33.520]  dictators that our national security apparatus doesn't like it's literally the same people
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:39.280]  who are color revolution professionals who have a long history of using the same tactics
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:44.480]  against foreign leaders they don't like to use against democratically elected president
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:52.040]  Donald Trump it's the same people using the very same playbook now I'd like to talk about
[1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:57.560]  one of the key figures in this operation a nexus point not only between color revolutions
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:04.520]  overseas and the color revolution against Trump but a nexus point between law fair and
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:13.240]  mass mobilization and so-called peaceful protests this is a man by the name of norm Eisen norm
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:22.560]  Eisen is a key legal hatchet man democrat operative former Obama ethics czar believe
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:32.640]  it or not and he is also a key architect of nearly every effort to censor sue impeach
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:40.120]  and overthrow the president he is the author of in fact a color revolution playbook literally
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:45.880]  called the playbook and one of the items he calls for in his playbook to overthrow regimes
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:54.280]  overseas he doesn't like is engineering election fraud scenarios using election fraud to engineer
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:04:02.280]  mass protests to question the legitimacy of the target leader norm Eisen has a long and
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:08.800]  checkered history going all the way back to his days at crew which is a law fair arm he's
[1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:19.520]  been behind over 180 lawsuits against Trump 10 articles of impeachment before the president's
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:25.960]  phone call was even made he was special counsel to the democrats for the impeachment process
[1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:35.440]  so let's stop right there and just understand that they're gonna gut this country you look
[1:04:35.440 --> 1:04:43.720]  at this guy a literal enemy of the republic I mean no wonder he hates himself so much
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:58.680]  look at that guy he projects his hate of himself on you will you stand up against him finally
[1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:04.280]  we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio ads saying

[1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:51.440]  by the way I want to say this can't censor truth.com can't censor truth.com that we should
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:55.960]  put that big URL up there I've seen some of the fancy bold stuff we've got because I was
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:07:00.920]  spending a lot of time as we can do in research on band.video watching some of the other shows
[1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:06.280]  watching interviews watching censored videos that are posted there the my pillow guys two
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:12.800]  hour report that's pretty good they've censored off YouTube that's up there and I noticed
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:22.360]  a lot of comments saying we can't share band.video man you need to create a new website I mean
[1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:26.680]  I probably saw 20 of those comments in different different videos I care about your comments
[1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:33.720]  I read them and you know I actually understand what you're saying they banned the term banned
[1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:38.920]  dot video about a year ago on Twitter Facebook Google all that just the URL so we started
[1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:45.000]  creating a system where we create new URLs that actually link to the very database and
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  the very same videos but then they've banned 2020 election center dot com and some of the
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:55.640]  others they've banned about six or seven the new one they haven't banned yet they may ban
[1:07:55.640 --> 1:08:02.560]  it tomorrow is can't censor truth.com and I think I should just shoot a real quick video
[1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:06.800]  up front saying hey everything at band.video gets censored you got to go to band.video
[1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:11.760]  itself and share it by email or text message everywhere else it's blocked by big tech by
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:16.360]  AI by the modern Soviet Union that runs our country we put it back up on screen for me
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:27.800]  thanks and so you need to go to the URL can't censor truth.com so yes I know that they're
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:34.600]  blocking band.video and info wars.com and news wars.com and so you want to share the

[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:12.960]  us and silence us will Americans put up with that we're here exposing their whole operation
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:18.840]  but let me shift gears for our special guest joins us next segment with an exclusive after
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:27.440]  he breaks his silence let me just show you this little stack of news right here mathematician
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:34.840]  says Biden election win a statistical impossibility now I don't just believe Edward Solomon who's
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:43.160]  a well-known mathematician and computer expert I know that Shiva idea Ray was a great Indian
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:48.480]  American who actually invented email and so much more show the exact same anomalies were
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:54.680]  not just in one state but five states they have algorithms with the exact same permutations
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:11:03.440]  and codes which is basically impossible and I didn't just believe Shiva I didn't believe
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:10.920]  Edward I went and looked up on the official state websites with their numbers by the minute
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:19.040]  and I looked it up with my own eyeballs two months ago and as Joe Biden likes to say son
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:25.080]  of a bitch it was true and that's why they say the election wasn't stolen just accept
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:30.040]  it blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but it doesn't have to be the voting machine
[1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:38.160]  company that did this it's someone with access to the system that does it and that's where
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:43.400]  my pillow and we warned a month ago and all these guys go wrong to say the company's doing
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:49.120]  it lets them sue you and divert no anybody can get into this like a laptop like saying
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:56.000]  oh my Hewlett Packer laptop my Sony laptop my Microsoft laptop my Apple laptop got hacked
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:03.520]  into Tim Cook did it no somebody did it so here's this part of the report from one American
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:08.800]  news or a great Patriots Matt petition says Biden election when a statistical impossibility
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:14.680]  it's posted on in foe wars dot com and if you don't use your rights you'll lose your
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:19.960]  rights so I hope you go there and I hope you share this report the system doesn't want
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:25.520]  you to see mass petition says the election results for Joe Biden at the precinct level
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:33.800]  are quote impossible and cannot occur naturally here's one America's Christina Bob Edward
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:38.840]  Solomon a mathematician took a closer look at the election results at the precinct level
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:44.000]  a specific anomaly occurred rendering the results impossible says Solomon Joe Biden
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:49.920]  won exactly the same percentage points across multiple precincts at designated times of day
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:55.320]  long enough to change the advantage Mr. Solomon walked me through an example of the precincts
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:59.000]  in Fulton County Georgia you can see that there's the the first precinct there it's
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:07.120]  at 1256 a.m. on November 4th and then when it abandons that ratio on its next tabulation
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:13.400]  update two more precincts they inherit that ratio on the same time stamp and then after
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:19.680]  they update their tabulations and abandon that ratio of 1 to 18 another precinct inherits
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:25.280]  it Solomon says that in order for the ratios to be that exact at clearly designated times
[1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:30.640]  computer software must have used an algorithm to change the votes specifically for roughly
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:36.120]  90 minutes at a time for rotating intervals the precincts changed the votes to ensure
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:43.480]  that Donald Trump won only 5.555 percent after the intervals completed the precincts returned
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:48.600]  to a normal vote count it says that this can only have been done by an algorithm it can't
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:53.360]  even be done by humans so if you had a bunch of human beings that were trying to rig an
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:57.880]  election and you said hey listen I want you to give Trump 15 percent over here and I want
[1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:03.520]  you to give Trump 13 and a half percent over here and 5.5 percent over here even human
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:09.120]  beings trying to replicate this wouldn't get it this perfect so what are the chances of
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:13.720]  this happening naturally Solomon says that there are not enough stars in the universe
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:17.840]  to which you can compare you can use the binomial probability formula and the chance of that
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:23.080]  event happening is 1 over 10 to an exponent so large is not enough stars in the universe
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:28.040]  so it's not enough atoms in the universe to explain the number it can't happen naturally
[1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:32.720]  the numbers produced by this election results can't happen naturally and humans trying to
[1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:37.960]  replicate the results would not be able to produce them this perfectly this evidence
[1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:43.480]  requires election officials to take a closer look and audit their results with real forensic
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:50.280]  experts I'm Christina Bob one American news Phoenix Arizona that's funny let's have the
[1:14:50.280 --> 1:14:55.720]  weasels that just ate all the hens and are sitting on top their guts their feathers their

[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:42.600]  the democrats are putting a hundred thousand dollar bounty on his head a preview of what's
[1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:49.240]  coming tomorrow photos be released of the actual agitators suing media and tweeters who defamed him
[1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:54.840]  fight for patriots who got innocently caught up in some of the madness on january 6 organizing in
[1:20:54.840 --> 1:21:01.240]  the spring so we don't lose the first amendment and we're going to talk about these operatives
[1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:07.240]  you know he's up to 75 thousand dollars just go to the guys main tweet and scroll down guys so ali
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:14.840]  alexander joins us again he's been a longtime republican activist a lot a lot more mainstream
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:19.000]  than i've been though now everything's moved to where we're at open calls for fema camps
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:25.720]  into first amendment uh cia killing patriots uh trump they want to put in prison uh blm and
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:31.240]  anti for running around rampaging but we organize peaceful demonstrations of you're going all over
[1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:37.560]  the country and even mainstream media took clips of us in the georgia capital back in november when
[1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:42.760]  we're there stopping people doing a sit-in and said look there they are in the us capital attacking
[1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:48.360]  arrest them and we contacted these guys and said here's the time stamp from november this you're
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:53.560]  wrong no response they so they know what they're doing they're very reckless we've got mainline
[1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:58.920]  democrats saying bring back internment camps for conservatives like the japanese and and others in
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:06.760]  world war two so ali uh you've not been overall hiding they banned you on over 30 platforms uh
[1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:10.920]  they've been trying to kill you i know people have come after you you've come on the show a few
[1:22:10.920 --> 1:22:16.120]  times but you've been getting lawyers and you know preparing uh to to to peacefully strike back
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:21.160]  against these lies but these people are crazy and they've really got a heart on for you they're
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:27.400]  saying roger stone organized the january sixth hill he wasn't even there they say i organized it
[1:22:27.400 --> 1:22:34.680]  they don't they call you a terrorist and say 75 000 bounty get him i mean these are serious
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:40.760]  crimes being committed these people are are they frothing matters are a larger plan well i think
[1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:45.480]  that there's a larger plan i think that they need to take you out because you have been the
[1:22:45.480 --> 1:22:52.440]  Cassandra of our country i mean if people have been listening to you uh they've seen uh what would
[1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:56.760]  come and so they have to take you out for that reason they need to take me out because they
[1:22:56.760 --> 1:23:03.400]  want to paint our peaceful movement as a white supremacist movement uh this is a plan to demonize
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:09.000]  all white people so they got to take out ali alexander in order to do that and then they want
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:15.640]  to rope in roger stone because you know he like me links a lot of the mainstream folks with the
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:23.160]  grassroots folks and this is what powered uh donald trump's majority and so i i think that we three
[1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:29.000]  are being targeted so that they can then put everyone back to sleep and have them follow
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:36.120]  liz cheney and really decapitating our majority and and really what she would do is that's right
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:40.760]  she's announced she's the leader of the republican party she hasn't had one percent support everybody
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:46.360]  hates her she they all want ted cruz arrested they're saying he's a terrorist they're lying and
[1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:52.600]  saying they were under attack at the capital aoc it's all lies it's all lies and this is meant
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:58.360]  to control our speech so they can control the thought so they can determine the overton window
[1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:03.080]  by which the republican party battles the democrat party while they build this tech
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:08.120]  technocracy and they know what happens the christians are all in the republican party
[1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:13.560]  and when we get fed up we control the entire republican party and they can't have that because
[1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:18.760]  we're the people who don't believe in a technocracy we're the people that gave the world federalism
[1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:23.880]  we're the people that gave the world localism that weren't really people that stabilized
[1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:29.160]  the republic when the pagans and the barbarians even of western civilization couldn't and so they
[1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:35.160]  need to mute the christians first so that we can't inspire the republican party to take
[1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:41.960]  meaningful action against this technocracy that they're building and keep breaking this down
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:48.200]  because they have put we'll pull up the don winslow queen he goes it's called evidence is the only
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:54.520]  thing it says they're i'll pull it up myself it's not not a problem and he then they know it's a video
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:25:00.760]  from another state another month and they go here they are planning and they're told we're not and
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:05.960]  i'm talking about national publications run with here they are in the capital planning the attack
[1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:12.040]  then they claim that congressman uh there it is then they claim that congressman the day before
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:17.240]  planned the attack with you with no evidence i mean this is lawsuit city they say we these are
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:24.280]  domestic terrorists they name us then they say get them arrest them attack them 75 thousand dollars
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:29.480]  that is the most open and shut criminal activity i've ever seen yeah you and i were on the phone
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:34.120]  yesterday you were giving me some terrific advice is you know someone you've been through this before
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:40.360]  but but um what what i've been doing is you know i've been communing with god i've had to find myself
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:46.120]  in all of this there's tens of thousands of hit pieces on me um unfortunately i've actually lost
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:52.680]  some family members in this process and so this has been like um anything in my career and this don
[1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:58.600]  winslow character is trying to get me killed that's all he wants he wants to get me killed he wants some
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:06.680]  antifa wacko to just blow my brains out on a live stream and then they'll use that moa he's a major
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:12.040]  author and the new york times is promoting him and like these are terrorists here they are planning
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:20.520]  the attack get them get them and to be clear just to be very clear i've not been accused of any crime
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:26.200]  i'm not being investigated to my knowledge for any crime i committed no crime i know that you
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:32.280]  committed no crime i know that roger stone uh committed no crime and they are using the
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:38.760]  famatory and libelous language about us because everyone's saying it all at once and so a lot
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:43.080]  of people are like hey i'll leave why don't you strike back well hello i don't have twitter i don't
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:48.200]  have youtube i don't have paypal i don't have stripe i don't have venmo i don't have instagram
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:54.360]  i don't have anything okay so by the way the video he puts out saying evidence that you quote he says
[1:26:54.360 --> 1:27:01.320]  this is a terrorist arrest this terrorist you'll win in any jury he's done that doesn't matter it's
[1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:07.960]  cut and dry he says destroy him arrest him get him he's saying lies to get you and it's a video of
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:13.240]  you trying to stop people from doing a sit-in at the georgia capital the damn video is you trying to
[1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:19.560]  stop people do you remember that me getting trolled so hard uh because i probably said some things i
[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:24.600]  shouldn't have said in an attempt to say hey we got to use political pressure we got to use public
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:30.680]  pressure and we got to be rowdy but peaceful this was our message for 10 weeks all across the country
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:35.880]  by the way you and i weren't funded by any corporate oligarchs you and i weren't helped by any foreign
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:43.000]  country we were teaching people how to demonstrate against a government that has taken our sovereignty
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.560]  from us if anything and by the way radio listeners can't see this we're showing vernon jones an
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:53.080]  incredible state rep all of us giving the crowd to be even quiet and good and well behaved this is
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:59.320]  how we do an insurrection lovingly and they turn this into you lead an eye leading a terror attack
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:06.200]  it's it's it's it's because they hate the patriots that we represent they don't want christians they
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:10.120]  don't want white people and they don't want southerners and the southerners in the public
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:17.000]  square anymore but i'm here to say the comeback starts now here sunday on the alex jones show
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.600]  all right i'm gonna try to shut up because i get really emotional about all this and watching it
[1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:24.680]  let's move all the alexander out of it let's move alex jones out of it we've covered that
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:29.880]  you're gonna strike back politically in a loving way against these people non-violently you can
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:33.320]  spend some time with that if you want but because you're a microcosm and carrying the cold mind
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:38.680]  but let's talk about trump his impeachment his trial what we're learning about it and how crazy
[1:28:38.680 --> 1:28:45.640]  all of this is straight ahead but man folks we now know from their own time magazine article
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:52.200]  they they set us up they ran the whole deal we knew this but ollie's got intel on what was supposed
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:58.680]  to happen on the 6th that didn't happen and molds inside the trump up the world is awakening the
[1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:04.040]  world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm they are discovering the globalist
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:10.200]  the elites the manipulation the cfr the trilateral commission the bill berg group the bohemian grove
[1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:18.120]  the club of rome and so even though it seems like the globalists are winning the truth is
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:23.560]  they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing we have
[1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:29.240]  forced them out in the open so as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are about to
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:35.640]  happen realize humanity is winning you've got to trust in the plan of god and trust in the plan of
[1:29:35.640 --> 1:29:43.240]  god's justice that is invincible that is ethereal timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:48.360]  trust in god to lead god and director sold and then take action against the globalist and realize
[1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:53.400]  you've got my commitment from alex jones and my crew to you we will never back down from the
[1:29:53.400 --> 1:30:00.440]  globalists and we will never surrender i sell supplements for two reasons because they work

[1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:07.720]  being buried alive scratching at the coffin lid and no one hears you you know that's where the
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:13.240]  term dead ranger comes from going back to ancient england and france maybe five percent of people
[1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:18.520]  on average some of the numbers show even higher would look like they were dead sound like they were
[1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:23.880]  dead and the primitive daughters of the time couldn't find a heartbeat so they'd sit there have a
[1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:29.320]  string down tied to the finger of the person six feet under so in case they woke up they wouldn't
[1:31:29.320 --> 1:31:37.400]  be buried alive so what i'm getting at here is this america is still awake america still is alive
[1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:43.400]  but we're going to have to realize that we're under attack and that we've been basically buried alive
[1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:49.160]  if we have any chance to metaphysically with god self break out of it we've got a call out to god
[1:31:49.160 --> 1:31:53.560]  to give us discernment and providence to get out of this and admit the globalist are trying to
[1:31:53.560 --> 1:32:01.000]  bury us alive with the lockdowns if we're ever going to turn this around look i've proven that

[1:33:20.920 --> 1:33:26.840]  methamphetamine the answer is no i hate stimulants other than like coffee i get really upset about
[1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:32.200]  this i mean we led a peaceful demonstration of a million people they tried to set me up they're
[1:33:32.200 --> 1:33:36.280]  calling for me to be put in prison all over the news along with president trump who's on trial
[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:44.360]  starting tomorrow this is serious back one time i had a security a couple years ago he goes uh
[1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:50.120]  he goes man you were totally down tired he goes he just came right back on back on breaking
[1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:55.320]  exploded you on drugs and i said here let me do a drug test call the portable drug test here
[1:33:55.320 --> 1:34:01.080]  piss in a cup no drugs i said you see that he said yeah i see that people think this is weird
[1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:08.680]  this is normal this is normal when you're under attack and and so ollie let me shut up now and
[1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:13.800]  give me the floor here we've got a big article out that we posted info wars dot com and give
[1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:18.440]  your own url a lot of people like to visit url folks everything else is censored stop the
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:23.480]  steel proof president trump didn't incite capital riot we're now getting a more clear picture
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:27.400]  of what happened and who was behind this and how there was a stand down and why there was no
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:31.960]  security or secret service for the president who said he was going to the capital this was
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:39.480]  incredible so so so lay this out on the eve of his trial tomorrow it's important that we have to
[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:44.440]  withhold some of this information for a few weeks while we worked with lawyers while everybody
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:50.280]  else worked with their independent lawyers and uh we got this information uh to the president's team
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:54.600]  they already knew a lot of it but they didn't know all of it what patriots need to know
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:35:01.080]  is that we called for patriots to be there on january 6 so that we could surround the
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:07.800]  capital building on permanent ground okay this was a permit given to us by the u.s capital police
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:14.120]  we worked with them for several weeks in which we said there's a million people coming make sure
[1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:18.760]  that y'all have the security now the u.s capital police will always tell you well your permit
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:24.360]  can only say that you'll have 50 people and we're like yes we'll have 50 people at our event speakers
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:29.640]  but you know that patriots are coming all across and we already had two events with a
[1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:34.440]  quarter million and almost a million before in the months before right and so they're very
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:39.400]  familiar with us i pay a consultant to deal with the national park service and the u.s capital
[1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:45.320]  police we have the receipts we have the permits we have the documentation that's what a lot of
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:50.920]  people are asking well why isn't auli alexander and alex joneson jail uh because we've got the
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:55.960]  goods folks we've absolutely got the goods well why the hell would we have the motive
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:36:00.200]  to when trump had them about to do a 10-day investigation and we were just showing our
[1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:06.680]  numbers why would we screw ourselves where's the motive we were on the eve of history we were on
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:13.880]  and and quite frankly we still made history because january 6 was peaceful okay 99.9 percent of a
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:21.080]  million people being totally peaceful when we feel that our election has been stolen is a first in
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:27.160]  human history god bless us okay god bless us because we're in it for the long haul but the idea
[1:36:27.160 --> 1:36:34.040]  that we wanted to interrupt the capital proceedings while congressman gozar our friend our ally the
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:40.520]  spirit animal of stop the seal that we wanted to interrupt his speech that messed up our plan this
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:46.920]  totally screwed us this totally screwed us and then you'll notice something alex the media wasn't
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:52.680]  with us the media was with the agitators they were agitating that's right none of them were no one
[1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:56.440]  covered the million people no one covered the trump speech they were already waiting before
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:00.280]  trump spoke starting the fight and as soon as he said go to the capital which we knew was gonna
[1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:05.000]  happen that's when the agitators went and attacked and you're about to expose who they are so let's
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  but but let's go to the agreement what was supposed to be on the jumbo tron what was supposed to be
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:13.480]  announced because we're not blaming the kramers we know it's somebody above her that did this but
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:19.560]  they decided not to put directions for the crowd in the jumbo tron so what everyone needs to know
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:25.800]  is that the capital uh on lot eight so this is off off the capital grounds are on the capital
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:32.040]  grounds but offside the uh the capital plaza so there's the building then there's the plaza around
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:37.000]  it and then there's the ground so we had a permit for the for the for the grounds and we were gonna
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:42.520]  start at nine or 10 am and we were gonna have 30 members of congress with us when the trump campaign
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:47.320]  called and said well let's combine all the events they were like but the president doesn't want to
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:53.160]  stop on your grassroots effort what can we do for you and i said well if we feature a couple of
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:57.640]  members of congress a couple of members of the senate and then we have to stop the steel folks
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:03.480]  speaking then we'll be good and then we can move to the capital after an event that takes place where
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:07.880]  secret service would allow and by the way let me just interrupt you some losers will say yeah
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:13.800]  january 6 is over why do you care the the president's on trial tomorrow making it up that ollie and i
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:19.480]  with roger stone launch an attack on the capital to destroy ourselves and meanwhile angifa and
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:25.160]  an embedded group set us up and they now brag isn't it crazy that suddenly they bragged this time
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:31.480]  magazine article i sent this to you did you read where they bragged they set us up yeah i mean it's
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:37.400]  it's it's surreal but you know what we are told this in in the bible we are told this in the art
[1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:43.720]  of war pride comes before the fall these people can't help but expose themselves thank god we
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:52.040]  have this time article confirming what you and i spent 10 weeks protesting so continue so so
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:56.280]  we're there listen to trump speak the secret service comes gets us out to leave the demonstration
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:00.680]  and and then we walked right into a trap trump walked right into a trap so go into what you know
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:04.360]  are you ready to release her name i mean maybe she didn't mean it maybe she didn't know but we
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:09.400]  know who was in command of everything we know who removed the jumbo tron directives we know who i
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:12.920]  mean i mean you're not going to direct a million people with no direction so you want to talk about
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:19.560]  it so yeah so let me let me preface this is is alex jones and i traveled across the country we
[1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:25.240]  know how crowds work we know what due diligence we have to to do to be good leaders and one of the
[1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:31.400]  agreements was that i would take the stage i would give a five-minute speech that ended with go to
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:38.280]  this place on the u.s capital and be peaceful just like trump said just like don jr said right we
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:42.120]  even had directives where we weren't going to use the word marching we were going to use the word
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:48.280]  walking we were acutely aware that we were governing the masses and then on the jumbo tron
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:53.880]  was supposed to play a video a stop to steal video that had a star on the map of the precise
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:40:00.040]  location this is what we had advertised for weeks okay on wildprotest.com and again the wall street
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:04.760]  journal confirms everything i'm saying right now and the lawyers i gotta say i wouldn't talk to them
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:09.480]  but they did a pretty fair job uh they actually did a fair job admitting the whole exactly what i
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:15.640]  said what you said yeah yeah and so what people need to understand is that when alex and i got there
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:24.600]  7 a.m the tables were tossed on us no alex speaking no roger speaking no ali speaking the cremers
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:31.160]  who are the women for america first who put america last even tried to get one of the campaign
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:37.400]  members kicked off the ground they called the national park that's caroline wren asked why it
[1:40:37.400 --> 1:40:43.720]  all happened right and so and again the reason all this matters folks is this notice everything i
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:48.280]  said on the day the night it happened is what the wall street journal and fbi now admit all i've
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:54.040]  gots the truth i'm not a leftist i don't lie my brain only works in truth it's it's like a flowing
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:57.880]  twice people say like why'd you just incriminate yourself or why'd you just do that because the
[1:40:57.880 --> 1:41:01.640]  cop pulled me over i said yeah i've been drinking took me to jail i did you get in love with the
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:05.960]  truth and it's like all you've got you know we're telling the truth we're not the left what we're
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:13.080]  telling you is what really happened for the trial the president he was set up right and it's the
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:18.280]  trial of our first amendment rights going forward and so it's not just president trump and this
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:23.640]  this really illegitimate impeachment the removal hearing in the senate is totally illegal but
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:27.720]  they're trying to impeach our right no i agree we gotta go to break we got one more segment
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:31.400]  and i only got part of the sentence i promise to play this medical doctor warning of the vaccine
[1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:36.280]  causing an autoimmune response it'll kill you uh months later which is in the documents we got
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:40.680]  to save lives here but specifically the key is not just defending trump to defend trump
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:45.320]  we get attacked for doing it he was set up and it wasn't the kramers you believe they were useful
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:49.960]  idiots are you going to release which i already thought already told my people three weeks ago
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:57.480]  i think was behind it yeah i mean i'm going to say it uh kebtrina pierce is a campaign advisor
[1:41:57.480 --> 1:42:02.920]  she makes a quarter million dollars on the trump campaign team she's one of the highest paid
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:08.040]  advisors to do nothing she lied to the president in november we caught her we called her out me and
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:13.880]  several members of stop the steel and she was behind this coup to ditch out part of the coalition
[1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:20.040]  at the ellipse event and that led to no leadership with the masses when we walked into a trap set to
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:25.800]  us by leftist agitators and i think that the president ought to totally distance himself
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:32.200]  from this grifter all i know is i watched her that day she was in command of the whole damn thing
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:36.520]  and we had agreements we didn't care about speaking up there we hell you're a target speaking with
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:40.680]  trump you kidding i was like hey take me off the list i'm on a whim but i'm kind of like let's just
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:45.240]  get this event happening and they were i don't know whether it was peacocking by him or what it was
[1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:49.880]  but man they set the president up i mean in no matter you know what's you're gonna fix it
[1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:51.240]  we'll be right back stay with us
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:43:03.160]  finally we're seeing major state governments in the united states running tv and radio ads saying

[1:44:57.560 --> 1:45:04.440]  on q for the last few years not because the giant huge q movement was competition my goodness i could
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:10.840]  have embraced q and just my show would have been bigger than ever but i can't lie to you not consciously
[1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:15.400]  i make mistakes sometimes and i knew q was controlled i knew it was putting out false info
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:20.680]  it was covering real issues but giving fake dates telling you we were invincible and now we're here
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:27.960]  in 2021 and i just see so many people now that are still believing in some magic trick and that
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:32.280]  trump's still president he's going to save us and that's just not the case we're going to have to
[1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:36.680]  save ourselves with god's help there's an old better one saying that trusted gov and top your
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:42.520]  camel hunter as thompson said created gov at roe from the rocks and that's what info wars is about
[1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:47.160]  is admitting the truth there's a lot of positive things the world's waking to the new world order
[1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:52.600]  q was an attempt to hijack our movement and it's failed now so now we know the truth and now we're

[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:23.560]  in that we're having trouble with i mean i'm talking about double triple quadruple delivery times

[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:23.160]  because you're banned everywhere so they can lie about you and set you up tell people where they
[1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:26.440]  find what you're actually saying what you're actually doing is you're doing some bold stuff
[1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:30.120]  and tomorrow you're going to release who the provocateurs were so much more you're about
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:34.680]  to follow lawsuits on folks which you've done before i mean i can't wait to see these people
[1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:40.440]  actually realize that we're going to stand up against them yeah i mean the comeback starts here
[1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:45.480]  again sunday on the alex jones show we're going to come out swinging because we've got no other
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:51.400]  choice our backup is against the wall we have fewer resources than the left but as you tell everyone
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:57.080]  we've got god and god is waiting to see if we will take these acts of faith and let's be honest
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:03.000]  after election day we were already gonna lose we were at one percent and we started this beautiful
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:07.720]  movement that then everybody said was cool and then as soon as we lost again everyone's like well
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:14.040]  now it's really really over it's never over okay god does win in the end and what he looks for is
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:19.720]  people of faith people who are righteous and acting in his name to fight and the enemy itself
[1:48:19.720 --> 1:48:26.520]  starts tabling on itself in time magazine admitting they stole the election this is going to be very
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:31.400]  instrumental to proving that we have no malice in what we're saying that we're not saying things
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:37.000]  that we think are falsehood in fact they want to rob us of all nuance we didn't just say that we
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:42.600]  knew the election was stolen we said we believe it's stolen that all the evidence suggests that
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:47.080]  that what are they hiding and why won't they be transparent in the counting and why are the
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:53.240]  bureaucrats lying and why won't Maricopa County but you're on video physically grabbing people
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:58.280]  saying don't do a sit-in don't even be civil disobedience which is Martin Luther King which
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:03.880]  they had a right to do to claim them that they were secretly organizing the attack an attack that
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:11.000]  made us look like idiots it's just asinine I just saw during the break that Kathy Grisson even weighed
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:16.680]  in on this saying Alex Jones and Ollie Alexander this video is of them planning the capital attack
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:20.920]  and so you know what you were saying about Don Winslow and them it's it's just fascinating but
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:25.880]  what I'm going to tell you is that tomorrow I'm going to release photos of people who have not
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:31.800]  been arrested people that the FBI is aware of and people who were agitators that were waving
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:39.000]  patriots in I believe that this evidence will reduce some of the misdemeanors to dropped charges
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:45.320]  I have not forgotten the patriots who engaged in activity I don't agree with but they were peaceful
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:50.760]  they were civilly disobedient and they don't deserve to have unequal treatment under the law
[1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:56.920]  okay BLM can riot and burn all this crap and no one gets charged including the arsonist the idea
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:01.320]  that a patriot who walks into open doors not knowing if they're supposed to be there or not
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:07.160]  because they don't visit DC that often is going to get charged with some heinous crime and lose
[1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:11.000]  their job no I'm not going to I'm not going to lead people stranded and I know that you're not
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:15.400]  either out so those pictures are being released those identities bring release tomorrow I told
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:20.760]  the FBI hey you guys should perceive me in this so that people can restore faith in the system but
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:25.160]  if you don't I've got a dead man switch you can lock me up all you want there's other people who
[1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:30.520]  were released the photos with my permission secondly I am going to be suing a lot of people
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:37.480]  anyone who claimed that we planned the siege and that we are criminals but we're public figures you
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:42.680]  can get away with lying about us but you can't get away with alleging that we committed a crime well
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:52.360]  they say you are a terrorist I am a terrorist here are bounties get us I mean they're trying to get
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:57.800]  us killed they're just trying to get us killed it's just I can't even believe that we're living in
[1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:02.840]  in this type of America it's just it's it's well the left doesn't care they they know they're working
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:07.880]  with you they brag in this 25 page article we work with foreign banks we work with you know the
[1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:13.240]  head of twitter and facebook we were we're just gonna we stole the election and nobody can stop us
[1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:18.200]  and then they post a video and everyone in for a month is in the comments going this is Ali and
[1:51:18.200 --> 1:51:25.000]  Alex in November stopping something at a capital they don't care the thing is they don't even care
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:31.560]  it's crazy well they don't care because they have the government behind them they have crooked
[1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:38.600]  political cops and I like to say this look a lot of the arrest in DC I'm not happy about it but a
[1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:44.200]  lot of them look legitimate and I say people say well Ali no no they're out of a million people a
[1:51:44.200 --> 1:51:48.680]  couple hundred idiots went in most of them were in between the velvet rose but there was 20 or 30
[1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:53.480]  that attacked cops I say arrest them charge them with terrorism no what do you make of all the
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:59.640]  former CIA deputy directors saying kill all the Trump supporters put us in re-education I mean
[1:51:59.640 --> 1:52:04.520]  even Alex Jones can't believe they're this crazy I mean this is moving so fast man this is nuts
[1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:11.400]  it's moving it's it's moving too fast it's just moving too fast and I mean thank god I had some
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:17.720]  patriots been traveling with me I haven't been alone a second well really in 10 weeks thank god
[1:52:17.720 --> 1:52:22.120]  because Alex I'm just gonna confess it on on air I probably would have committed suicide
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:26.760]  just honestly probably shouldn't be saying this on air but they got they got this close to having
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:33.640]  Ali Alexander commit suicide what they have done to me in losing my platforms and losing family
[1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:39.960]  members and losing my income and having to move out from my house and sell my car um there are
[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:44.760]  dark moments there and thank god I went off into the mountains and I was surrounded by people who
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:50.360]  love me and love god but it's it's it's shocking that they're trying to gaslight us but that's
[1:52:50.360 --> 1:52:56.520]  what they want they want to spare they want us to have to curse god they want us to curse god god
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:53:01.800]  where are you where are you wherever you're chosen people where are you he is here and he is working
[1:53:01.800 --> 1:53:08.680]  in the mystery and this sucks right now but we have no choice but to go on the offense and attack
[1:53:08.680 --> 1:53:13.960]  them and to tell the truth about them and ask our neighbors to wake up to this heinous truth
[1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:19.480]  that freedom is gone and that we've got to restore it we've got to resurrect it uh if you will it's
[1:53:19.480 --> 1:53:25.800]  dead we've got to resurrect it and so so that's what I'm on your show to talk about is is I can't
[1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:30.520]  I can't believe that every day I wake up they want me to forget about everything else they've
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:36.280]  done I couldn't believe I couldn't believe a year ago some professor wrote a book saying
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:41.480]  Sandy Hook didn't happen I'm not in the book and it was at Wall Street Journal headline Alex Jones
[1:53:43.080 --> 1:53:48.440]  loses court case no one died at Sandy Hook and I had my lawyers send a book to the Wall Street
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:53.800]  Journal call them and say he's not in this book and they said we don't care Suez and you hit that
[1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:58.360]  moment where you realize they look back and they go yeah we're lying we don't care at that moment
[1:53:58.360 --> 1:54:03.720]  you're like you're that bad so it's not just the very top that's corrupt they've gotten armies of
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:13.080]  people ollie that will lie now armies of liars and people who will echo echo the lies and then
[1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:19.320]  people who will remix the lies and then it's another news cycle I mean I watched I watched I had to
[1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:27.400]  stop reading the news I watched it go from people plan the capital siege to Ali Alexander plan the
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:32.920]  capital siege to Ali Alexander and three members of Congress plan the capital siege to Ali Alexander
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:37.880]  three members of Congress plan the capital siege but first they did a reconnaissance tour and I'm
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:43.880]  just thinking who is telling you this where are you reading this this is nowhere this is alive
[1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:50.680]  that's the daily mail the largest paper in all of the world now AOC is up there saying they came to
[1:54:50.680 --> 1:54:57.240]  kill me she wasn't even the building and she says Ted Cruz wants to kill her we are in the theater
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:03.160]  of pretend and the absurd and satanism and you are rewarded with little pellets of attention and
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:09.320]  little pellets of food and the new currency that they want to push on us when you lie about people
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:14.680]  who believe in what I call the great preset okay we don't need the great reset we need the great
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:21.560]  preset which is honoring the by the way the leftists are all over saying you're on oh my god he's
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:27.240]  surfaced he's claiming we just showed proof it was a Georgia capital and they think we're scared
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:33.480]  I'm scared for them we're on record we are just trying to stop a riot and they go oh look they're
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:40.120]  scared their defense we we found Ali getting getting getting I mean this is ridiculous man oh look
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:46.200]  there we are with Vernon Jones planting the attack at the DC capital it's Georgia with us like
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:51.000]  organizing a perfect photo op and and and Vernon Jones like don't raise your voice I'm like that's
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:56.920]  right we don't raise our voice you're like shut up don't raise your voice meanwhile you're like kill
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:05.000]  everybody it's insane how prudent we were and I used to say this in all of my speeches I used to
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:11.320]  say st. Thomas Aquinas said that prudence is a virtue so we must escalate always but we must be
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:16.280]  prudent in our escalation let us not forget that they're coming after our right to speak because
[1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:21.400]  we needed common sense before the Declaration of Independence we needed the federalist papers before
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:27.320]  the United States Constitution if they take out info wars and they take out Ali then there is no
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:32.520]  one to talk about freedom but I mean you go back to the video look at the capital planning event
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:37.320]  that they're running this video on Twitter saying this is us with an army in the U.S.
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:41.720]  capital it's obviously not the U.S. Capitol we're having a peaceful event it's insane all right

[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:49.960]  trying to figure out what's going on they're very upset that you're not some demon they can
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:54.920]  shut down and lie about and so again where do people find what you're writing what you're doing
