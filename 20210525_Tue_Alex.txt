[00:00.000 --> 00:09.320]  From the dying miners was sent to China's highest security biolab, 1500 km to the north
[00:09.320 --> 00:12.080]  to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[00:12.080 --> 00:17.840]  They had tests that they sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology which tested positive
[00:17.840 --> 00:19.360]  for a coronavirus.
[00:19.360 --> 00:24.760]  And samples of the bat coronavirus taken from the feces in the mine were also taken to the
[00:24.760 --> 00:27.600]  Wuhan lab.
[00:27.600 --> 00:34.000]  The comparison tests would later reveal it was a 96% match to COVID-19.
[00:34.000 --> 00:41.080]  The very simple data elements on the ground all point to the likelihood that this virus
[00:41.080 --> 00:42.640]  came from the lab.
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.520]  Someone will say, well, maybe somebody took it from the wild, put it in the lab and then
[00:48.520 --> 00:50.680]  it escaped from the lab.
[00:50.680 --> 00:54.600]  But that means it was in the wild to begin with.
[00:54.600 --> 00:57.480]  So that's why I don't get what they're talking about.
[00:57.480 --> 01:03.320]  If it isn't manipulated in the lab and you're trying to say it escaped from the lab, then
[01:03.320 --> 01:05.600]  how did it get in the lab?
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.200]  It got in the lab because somebody isolated it from the environment.
[01:09.200 --> 01:15.840]  Government defenders of gain of function, such as yourself, say that COVID-19 mutations
[01:15.840 --> 01:18.500]  were random and not designed by man.
[01:18.500 --> 01:23.480]  But interestingly, the technique that Dr. Berrick developed forces mutations by serial
[01:23.480 --> 01:28.000]  passage through cell culture that the mutations appear to be natural.
[01:28.000 --> 01:35.080]  We have not funded gain of function research on this virus in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[01:35.080 --> 01:42.320]  No matter how many times you say it, there was research done with Dr. Xi and Dr. Berrick.
[01:42.320 --> 01:47.040]  They have collaborated on gain of function research where they enhanced the SARS virus
[01:47.040 --> 01:53.120]  to infect human airway cells and they did it by merging a new spike protein on it.
[01:53.120 --> 01:54.760]  That is gain of function.
[01:54.760 --> 01:59.040]  That was joint research between the Wuhan Institute and Dr. Berrick.
[01:59.040 --> 02:00.040]  You can't deny it.
[02:00.040 --> 02:05.480]  A year ago, they had Time Magazine, Newsweek articles, Snopes articles, Newsguard articles
[02:05.480 --> 02:11.920]  that the company that Bill Gates owns saying that I'm debunked and my guests are debunked
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.640]  and that there was never any connection to the Wuhan lab origin or the viruses manufactured
[02:16.640 --> 02:21.680]  even though top scientists 16 months ago scanned it and said it's five different viruses.
[02:21.680 --> 02:25.560]  Well now they're having to admit it's man-made and Fauci now says it looks like it may have
[02:25.560 --> 02:27.080]  come from a lab in China.
[02:27.080 --> 02:32.400]  Think that we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to
[02:32.400 --> 02:35.120]  the best of our ability exactly what happened.
[02:35.120 --> 02:41.760]  Oh, but who ran the program to weaponize COVID virus, coronavirus?
[02:41.760 --> 02:46.240]  It was Fauci and that's come out in Congress last week.
[02:46.240 --> 02:48.280]  Wuhan origin for the virus is a no brainer.
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.200]  Wuhan is home to China's leading center for coronavirus research.
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.200]  Researchers were genetically engineering bat coronaviruses to attack human cells.
[02:56.200 --> 02:58.840]  They were doing so under minimal safety conditions.
[02:58.840 --> 03:03.600]  If the virus with an unexpected infectiousness had been generated there, its escape would
[03:03.600 --> 03:05.280]  be no surprise.
[03:05.280 --> 03:08.200]  Journalists want to know.
[03:08.200 --> 03:10.640]  Secretary of State wants to know.
[03:10.640 --> 03:12.520]  Secretary of Health and Human Services want to know.
[03:12.520 --> 03:13.520]  Journalists want to know.
[03:13.520 --> 03:14.520]  Republicans want to know.
[03:14.520 --> 03:15.520]  Americans want to know.
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.320]  Democrats in Congress want to know where this thing started.
[03:20.320 --> 03:25.320]  But everybody's having a field day with USA Today fact checkers and Snopes fact checkers
[03:25.320 --> 03:30.320]  saying Jones is full of it a year ago and Senator Rand Paul's full of it.
[03:30.320 --> 03:31.320]  Why?
[03:31.320 --> 03:33.320]  There's no connection to Wuhan.
[03:33.320 --> 03:34.320]  Why?
[03:34.320 --> 03:35.800]  Because why?
[03:35.800 --> 03:40.280]  We sent a fact checking team to Wuhan that's been three hours there and it was run by the
[03:40.280 --> 03:42.920]  people that ran the Wuhan operation.
[03:42.920 --> 03:47.920]  David, of course, made it out of Wuhan a year ago just before the lockdown joining us tonight
[03:47.920 --> 03:48.920]  from Shanghai.
[03:48.920 --> 03:50.920]  David, what have you learned?
[03:50.920 --> 03:55.280]  It was after the Huanan seafood market, the original ground zero, or at least believed
[03:55.280 --> 04:00.720]  to have been the ground zero by Chinese authorities, had to close down and that was wiping it clean
[04:00.720 --> 04:05.040]  and they were doing so according to Chinese authorities so as to stop it from spreading.
[04:05.040 --> 04:09.880]  But in doing that, you're also destroying evidence from a scientific perspective.
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.520]  But even if there is unfettered access, etc., etc., and the months that will be required
[04:14.520 --> 04:18.840]  to undertake this kind of examination does take place, at the end of the day the WHO
[04:18.840 --> 04:23.680]  is owned and operated by the sovereign states of the United Nations, one of which is China
[04:23.680 --> 04:26.120]  and a very important one at that.
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.280]  And so where I get concerned is that the word independent is simply not really accurate.
[04:32.280 --> 04:35.720]  This is not an independent organization nor an independent investigation.
[04:35.720 --> 04:40.800]  They've concluded that it's most likely that the virus came through transmission from bats
[04:40.800 --> 04:45.960]  to human via another animal and very unlikely it came from a Wuhan lab.
[04:45.960 --> 04:51.760]  So you don't know something's real until mainstream media has debunked it.
[04:51.760 --> 04:56.800]  As soon as you see that, you know you should look more into it.
[04:56.800 --> 05:04.480]  Look, we're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials and right now we've got store-wide
[05:04.480 --> 05:11.080]  free shipping, we've got double-patria points, we've got 40% off on DNA Force Plus, sold

[05:18.960 --> 05:22.400]  I've talked about each one for several minutes, but a lot of you've already used them, some
[05:22.400 --> 05:23.400]  of you haven't.
[05:23.400 --> 05:24.400]  You've got to go check these out.

[06:13.400 --> 06:31.080]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next video.
[06:31.080 --> 07:00.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is May 25th on this Live Tuesday Worldwide Transmission.
[07:00.440 --> 07:04.600]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are fighting back against the global tyrants, and we can
[07:04.600 --> 07:13.000]  simply get population of this planet to speak up and say, no, we're going to win.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.480]  I forget how much influence this broadcast has had over the years and just how many
[07:17.480 --> 07:21.840]  people we've touched thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[07:21.840 --> 07:28.320]  Just this morning, I was working out, and one of the people I was talking to in the
[07:28.320 --> 07:31.440]  gym said, oh, yeah, who is this group?
[07:31.440 --> 07:38.000]  I like this song, and I go, that's Matt Bellamy of Muse, and the song is Uprising.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.680]  He said, man, those lyrics, it sounds like it's your show, and I said, well, it is my
[07:42.680 --> 07:43.680]  show.
[07:43.680 --> 07:47.320]  I directly inspired that entire album and that song.
[07:47.320 --> 07:48.320]  And the guy said, really?
[07:48.320 --> 07:49.320]  And I said, oh, yeah, here.
[07:49.320 --> 07:53.760]  And I just typed in Alex Jones, Matt Bellamy, and I said, here, here he is saying I helped
[07:53.760 --> 07:55.880]  create that song.
[07:55.880 --> 07:58.040]  And the person was blown away.
[07:58.040 --> 08:02.240]  Like one time I was at the gym, and I was like, I really like Mike Judge.
[08:02.240 --> 08:03.240]  He's great.
[08:03.240 --> 08:04.480]  And I said, yeah, he's a good friend of mine.
[08:04.480 --> 08:07.360]  Actually, I inspired the original King of the Hill.
[08:07.360 --> 08:11.160]  The person thought I was crazy, and I was at an actual public gym, and I said, here, here's
[08:11.160 --> 08:12.160]  Mike Judge saying it.
[08:12.160 --> 08:14.000]  The person was completely blown away.
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.520]  But you see, that wasn't about me bragging.
[08:20.520 --> 08:26.640]  It was about understanding the power of the individual, because I was on access TV in
[08:26.640 --> 08:32.320]  1995 and 1996, when Mike Judge was coming up with King of the Hill, and I didn't meet
[08:32.320 --> 08:37.640]  him for many, many years later, and had no idea until he told me, when we were at dinner
[08:37.640 --> 08:42.760]  once, that I helped inspire King of the Hill, and then I was at his house, and he brought
[08:42.760 --> 08:47.200]  me in a room and said, here's the VHS tape that you're on, where I got the idea for Dale
[08:47.200 --> 08:51.440]  Gribble, and you're also a composite of some of the other people, and he put the tape in,
[08:51.440 --> 08:52.560]  and it was me.
[08:52.560 --> 08:55.280]  I said, the three dales on the tape.
[08:55.280 --> 08:56.760]  He later gave an interview and said that.
[08:56.760 --> 08:59.640]  That isn't about me saying, oh, look, I'm powerful.
[08:59.640 --> 09:08.080]  I was on access TV and influenced one of the most popular TV shows in world history.
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.280]  That's what you can do when you're on access TV, or on a YouTube channel, or on a Facebook
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.280]  video you put out, whether it's 1,000 views, 100 views, or 10 million views.
[09:17.280 --> 09:22.240]  It's the action of you saying no and standing up and speaking out that is going to change
[09:22.240 --> 09:23.240]  the world.
[09:23.240 --> 09:29.480]  And so all the time, I see something, or I hear something, and I forget how we directly
[09:29.480 --> 09:32.320]  influenced it.
[09:32.320 --> 09:37.040]  I got told by some of the writers and one of the editors on the first Captain America
[09:37.040 --> 09:40.080]  that came out that I thought was pretty good, actually, or maybe it was the second one,
[09:40.080 --> 09:45.280]  the whole Winter Soldier one, where the government's using AI to take over and false flags to
[09:45.280 --> 09:47.920]  basically set up the good guys.
[09:47.920 --> 09:50.960]  Later learned that my show was the big influence on that.
[09:50.960 --> 09:56.880]  Chris Carter with the new X-Files launch said the new series was basically influenced heavily
[09:56.880 --> 09:57.880]  by Alex Jones.
[09:57.880 --> 09:59.880]  He said that in variety.
[09:59.880 --> 10:05.720]  I could go on for the next four hours telling you how I influenced that, how I influenced
[10:05.720 --> 10:06.720]  this.
[10:06.720 --> 10:15.080]  And it's not about how great I am, it's how powerful individualism is.
[10:15.080 --> 10:21.000]  Did you know I influenced the big Marvel comic in-game with galactic extermination
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.760]  and the idea of that plot from my film in-game?
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.440]  And I could go on and on and on for hours, but I'm only saying that because I listened
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.360]  last night to about two hours of yesterday's show after my wife and youngest daughter had
[10:34.360 --> 10:37.760]  gone to bed and my older daughter gets upstairs watching TV.
[10:37.760 --> 10:47.600]  I got in bed and I listened to part of the yesterday's show and it was damn depressing.
[10:47.600 --> 10:51.600]  There I was reading mainstream news articles, how they put chemicals in the food and water
[10:51.600 --> 10:58.760]  to sterilize you, and by 2045, 2047, everyone will be sterilized.
[10:58.760 --> 11:02.720]  And that was a scary thing.
[11:02.720 --> 11:11.160]  But the good news is we're on air exposing it all, we're on air talking about it all.
[11:11.160 --> 11:14.480]  And we've had an effect before, and we're going to have an effect again, and we're
[11:14.480 --> 11:18.840]  not caught flat-footed, and everybody's talking about arresting Fauci and Bill Gates right
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.720]  now and how they purposely released this, and the Chinese are bragging they did it
[11:23.720 --> 11:26.360]  to help shut down the West.
[11:26.360 --> 11:31.960]  And so as bad as all this news and information is, the good news is M4 Wars is on the air.
[11:31.960 --> 11:38.320]  And Tucker Carlson is on the air, and I'm not trying to get Tucker in trouble.
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.000]  Tucker does it behind obviously if I say this, but again, media matters will write a big
[11:42.000 --> 11:43.000]  article about it.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.760]  Tucker's fine with that, but I help wake up Tucker Carlson.
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.720]  None of this is a secret.
[11:50.720 --> 11:52.120]  Who are you waking up?
[11:52.120 --> 11:53.400]  And the answer is the world.
[11:53.400 --> 11:54.400]  You did this.
[11:54.400 --> 11:59.320]  This audience of activists deserves as much credit as I do.
[11:59.320 --> 12:03.440]  Anything more, because I know your friends, your family, your neighbors have ridiculed
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.360]  you for what you've done, but you knew you were doing the right thing.
[12:08.360 --> 12:15.080]  So again, as dark as things are and as scary as things are, evil always launches its attack.
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.080]  It always looks like it's winning for a while until people wake up and stand up, and then
[12:19.080 --> 12:20.320]  we turn the tide.
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.320]  And the question is, how bad is it going to get before that actually happens?
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.400]  Now that said, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[12:27.400 --> 12:35.160]  I was sitting there right before I went live thinking, how in the world do I describe this?
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.840]  And it's a full assault.
[12:36.840 --> 12:40.800]  Like I had said, they may release a simulant bio-weapon that still kills some people, but
[12:40.800 --> 12:45.680]  it's not that deadly, then bringing global lockdowns, lock us down for a decade, test
[12:45.680 --> 12:48.200]  that out, and then wipe everybody else out after that.
[12:48.200 --> 12:52.440]  That's what I saw from their propaganda and their preparations.
[12:52.440 --> 12:55.680]  But now they're so far behind, they're not going to wait.
[12:55.680 --> 12:59.360]  They're going to release something new, I'd say six months a year, hell, maybe they've
[12:59.360 --> 13:02.680]  already released it because they're in so much trouble.
[13:02.680 --> 13:07.920]  And they admit the global lockdown is to stop populism, stop nationalism, stop anti-globalism.
[13:07.920 --> 13:11.760]  Klaus Schwab says it.
[13:11.760 --> 13:12.760]  John Kerry says it.
[13:12.760 --> 13:17.120]  I mean, they're all running their big, fat, evil mouths in the Atlantic and the New York
[13:17.120 --> 13:18.120]  Times.
[13:18.120 --> 13:22.120]  They are preying on you and your family, but it's all out in the open.
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.440]  These are just monstrous creatures.
[13:24.440 --> 13:26.160]  They've announced new gas taxes.
[13:26.160 --> 13:31.280]  They've announced no mining allowed in the U.S. for rare earth minerals.
[13:31.280 --> 13:36.800]  We must buy them all from China for all the new electric cars.
[13:36.800 --> 13:44.520]  They have their foot on our neck, they have their boot on our neck, and all of it is to
[13:44.520 --> 13:45.520]  destroy us.
[13:45.520 --> 13:46.520]  We're being conquered.
[13:46.520 --> 13:50.760]  This is modern warfare.
[13:50.760 --> 13:54.880]  And the minute you wake up to that and others do, is the minute it all stops because it's
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.880]  all illegitimate, it's all illegal, it's all criminal.
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.320]  And you realize the Chinese Communist and a few megabanks bought off almost all the Democratic
[14:02.320 --> 14:08.480]  Party and some of the Republican Party, in many cases for 10, 20 million for a vice president,
[14:08.480 --> 14:12.800]  for a congressman, maybe a million bucks, and they own them for life because they could
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.200]  destroy them anytime they want because they snap their fingers, the Chinese snap their
[14:16.200 --> 14:22.420]  fingers, and CNN will expose what senator took Chinese money, what congressman took
[14:22.420 --> 14:29.160]  Russian money, and then they can send those people to jail because the FBI selectively
[14:29.160 --> 14:30.160]  enforces.
[14:30.160 --> 14:35.600]  And then you've got the top brass of the FBI on the Chinese payroll and on other dictatorships
[14:35.600 --> 14:40.840]  payroll, and then even the director of the FBI gives 100 grand to Biden when he's vice
[14:40.840 --> 14:43.640]  president says, I want to get more business deals with you.
[14:43.640 --> 14:51.200]  I mean, that's a direct bribe, and see, they think they're invincible, but they know you
[14:51.200 --> 14:55.400]  still got guns and they know you still got speech, and so they want to really bankrupt
[14:55.400 --> 15:00.920]  you and get you fully under control of the universal basic income, and they want to poison
[15:00.920 --> 15:04.440]  you and give you a debilitating disease so they can control you.
[15:04.440 --> 15:05.440]  You are under assault.
[15:05.440 --> 15:10.480]  So that's the takeaway here, is that this is the big assault, it's only going to get
[15:10.480 --> 15:11.480]  worse from here.
[15:11.480 --> 15:14.960]  I don't know how long I'll even be on the air, but that's okay.
[15:14.960 --> 15:18.840]  We've got an important mission to continue, but I've had a big weight taken off of me
[15:18.840 --> 15:24.560]  because I operate in information and research and history, but I have a spiritual algorithm
[15:24.560 --> 15:28.880]  that lets me know that I've already, to a certain extent, completed my main mission.
[15:28.880 --> 15:32.120]  Everything else is gravy from this point on, and now it's going to be up to you and everybody
[15:32.120 --> 15:38.440]  else how far you let them go, but I've already delivered my payload, and so I'm at peace
[15:38.440 --> 15:39.440]  with God.
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.120]  But let me tell you, you're going to end up fighting them, folks.
[15:43.120 --> 15:46.680]  The question is how long and how bad are you going to be, and how bad a position you're
[15:46.680 --> 15:49.880]  going to be before you finally realize everything is this.
[15:49.880 --> 15:52.600]  This is the takeover, this is the end of the world as you know it.
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.760]  They are coming to literally kill you and your family.
[15:54.760 --> 15:58.320]  We'll be right back.
[15:58.320 --> 16:03.640]  The BioProse are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat
[16:03.640 --> 16:05.640]  everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[16:05.640 --> 16:10.640]  For the first time, the BioProse are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[16:10.640 --> 16:12.480]  products to the everyday consumer.
[16:12.480 --> 16:16.960]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSepticPro, a product specifically
[16:16.960 --> 16:19.960]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[16:19.960 --> 16:24.320]  BioSepticPro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[16:24.320 --> 16:26.240]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[16:26.240 --> 16:28.840]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.800]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[16:33.800 --> 16:37.520]  BioSepticPro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[16:37.520 --> 16:41.800]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to
[16:41.800 --> 16:46.760]  treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than
[16:46.760 --> 16:47.760]  its competitors.
[16:47.760 --> 16:51.920]  BioSepticPro is safer plumbing, human, animal, and aquatic life.

[16:58.480 --> 17:03.520]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where InfoWars is, and it's always
[17:03.520 --> 17:07.920]  a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons that
[17:07.920 --> 17:09.800]  make all this possible.
[17:09.800 --> 17:15.080]  So in short, the world's awakening, the spiral of censorship, InfoWars has never been more
[17:15.080 --> 17:20.040]  influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[17:20.040 --> 17:25.600]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down because
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.640]  most of us selling products which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others, have
[17:29.640 --> 17:31.520]  been sold out for up to seven months.
[17:31.520 --> 17:32.520]  Well guess what?
[17:32.520 --> 17:36.160]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months.
[17:36.160 --> 17:41.000]  It's 40% off, it's amazing, at InfoWars.com and for the week leading up through Memorial
[17:41.000 --> 17:46.960]  Day we have store-wide free shipping and double-patria points and alpha powers back in stock and super
[17:46.960 --> 17:51.200]  mill vitalities back in stock and pollen block and vasovics that are all back in stock as
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.200]  much as 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points, InfoWars.com.
[17:56.200 --> 18:22.200]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, InfoWars.
[18:26.200 --> 18:55.200]  Endless red tape to keep the truth confined, Tuesday live feed, globalists, ladies and
[18:55.200 --> 19:06.520]  gentlemen, have now begun forced segregation of vaxxed and non-vaxxed and they have begun
[19:06.520 --> 19:10.880]  giving children inoculations without parental consent all over the western world.
[19:10.880 --> 19:17.080]  This all is completely illegal, completely outrageous and if it was a liquor, it'd be
[19:17.080 --> 19:18.080]  200 proof.
[19:18.080 --> 19:22.520]  That means solid alcohol, solid poison.
[19:22.520 --> 19:26.400]  This isn't Oklahoma Bible Belt 2% beer.
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.440]  This is 200 proof, baby.
[19:31.440 --> 19:34.840]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, let me just read you these headlines and I have the video
[19:34.840 --> 19:38.720]  of all this.
[19:38.720 --> 19:43.960]  Canada pop-up clinic offers kids free ice cream to get COVID vaccines, no parental permission
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.880]  required, parents go and try to stop the children, police don't let them.
[19:48.880 --> 19:54.600]  It's completely illegal, just unbelievable under Canadian law, US law, world law, plus
[19:54.600 --> 19:58.640]  it's experimental, holy mackerel.
[19:58.640 --> 20:02.720]  But that's the holy grail in Europe and the US and Canada, they're passing laws, California
[20:02.720 --> 20:07.400]  already did, where 12-year-olds, 11-year-olds can have abortions without their parents knowing
[20:07.400 --> 20:12.480]  and get vaccines and people can give you HIV and not get in trouble knowingly.
[20:12.480 --> 20:14.280]  A real virus.
[20:14.280 --> 20:19.800]  Canada pop-up clinic offers kids free ice cream to get COVID vaccine, no parental permission
[20:19.800 --> 20:20.800]  required.
[20:20.800 --> 20:27.080]  We have footage, told you about this yesterday, but now we have the footage, it happened.
[20:27.080 --> 20:31.160]  Now we have the footage, the parents are screaming behind a police line, so they're shutting
[20:31.160 --> 20:36.480]  down churches, having hundreds of police guard, one church alone with black fencing
[20:36.480 --> 20:38.880]  ups, you can't see the evil church.
[20:38.880 --> 20:44.240]  So the pornography is on TV during the family hour, but the churches are behind black tarps.
[20:44.240 --> 20:50.640]  You go, well, that's so recklessly corrupt, yes, they're moving the Overton window.
[20:50.640 --> 20:57.640]  You don't know what that is, look into it, the psychological term, but they do such
[20:57.640 --> 21:03.520]  incredible radical stuff in your face that even if you try to get your rights back, they've
[21:03.520 --> 21:07.280]  already taken you so far, you're conditioned to accept what's happened.
[21:07.280 --> 21:12.000]  They take you a billion miles down a rat hole, if you fight back, you only get back 500 million
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.920]  miles, they still got you 500 million miles in their territory.
[21:17.920 --> 21:23.200]  Canada pop-up clinic, it's on infowars.com, offers kids free ice cream to get COVID vaccine,
[21:23.200 --> 21:29.760]  no parental permission required, an experimental shot, mass death, mass problems, and wait until
[21:29.760 --> 21:31.080]  I get to that in a moment.
[21:31.080 --> 21:38.480]  Here's another one, divorce court, judge orders COVID-19 vaccine for Liberty County man, that's
[21:38.480 --> 21:45.520]  the actual name of the county in Texas, to see his children.
[21:45.520 --> 21:50.640]  That's in Texas, that's the medical tyranny of these judges, a Liberty County man says
[21:50.640 --> 21:54.520]  his rights were violated, and the judge is on the news admitting it, but he said to be
[21:54.520 --> 22:02.120]  fair, you and your ex-wife have to have the vaccine or you can't see your children.
[22:02.120 --> 22:07.320]  That's on Fox 26 out of Houston, Texas, oh, it's worse.
[22:07.320 --> 22:14.040]  This is the biggest one, zero hedge, it's up at infowars.
[22:14.040 --> 22:20.680]  Decided to divide is the actual quote from the government, Mayor Lightfoot, but it's
[22:20.680 --> 22:26.240]  being done all over the world, Chicago segregates restaurants for unvaxxed, and the restaurants
[22:26.240 --> 22:32.680]  are being ordered under the restaurant health department, so it's a government vaccine
[22:32.680 --> 22:37.960]  passport for restaurants or any other business that you must check everyone with a government
[22:37.960 --> 22:38.960]  approved ID.
[22:38.960 --> 22:43.120]  So all the left said, oh, we're not planning vaccine passports, 16 months ago, and I told
[22:43.120 --> 22:47.960]  you, 10 months ago, five months ago, a month ago, remember just a week ago, debunking articles,
[22:47.960 --> 22:52.320]  no one's planning that, well, the UK health minister said, yes, you're going to have a
[22:52.320 --> 22:56.120]  vaccine passport, and you're crazy if you don't accept it.
[22:56.120 --> 23:00.880]  Just a month ago, they were still saying it doesn't exist, when they were formulating
[23:00.880 --> 23:03.720]  and preparing them years ago.
[23:03.720 --> 23:06.840]  This story is incredible.
[23:06.840 --> 23:11.840]  It says you get full service in all the menu when you are vaccinated, but you're putting
[23:11.840 --> 23:19.280]  a segregated area and don't get full service, oh, so it's back to black people have to go
[23:19.280 --> 23:23.080]  to the bathroom out back, or have to come get order food through a window in the back
[23:23.080 --> 23:27.120]  if you're lucky, if that restaurant even serves you.
[23:27.120 --> 23:29.960]  Most of the time, there would just be a bathroom, you know, you black people can just go find
[23:29.960 --> 23:35.800]  a place to go to the bathroom, oh, you can't come to a lunch counter and even pick your
[23:35.800 --> 23:39.440]  food up, you got to go around back, we don't want to look at you, well, now that's what
[23:39.440 --> 23:44.080]  they say, oh, they're going to put you in a separate room, got to go read the article,
[23:44.080 --> 23:52.560]  it's incredible, and it's got all the links to CBS Chicago, UK health secretary suggests
[23:52.560 --> 23:58.360]  critics of vaccine passports are crazies for not wanting the shot and not wanting the passport
[23:58.360 --> 24:01.640]  as they roll out government passport.
[24:01.640 --> 24:06.080]  A digital system that tracks your medical records that's been checked by people at the
[24:06.080 --> 24:13.680]  grocery store, the bank, the pub, or even to go outside, oh, I mean, boom, we're here.
[24:13.680 --> 24:17.240]  Of course it was always the plan, Klaus Schwab said five years ago was the plan.
[24:17.240 --> 24:22.400]  The Rockefeller Foundation operation lockstep 11 years ago said it was the damn plan.
[24:22.400 --> 24:27.080]  How do you think I'm on Jesse Ventura's show in 2009 saying the World Health Organization
[24:27.080 --> 24:31.920]  will have a global system of forced inoculation, and they'll claim it's not forced inoculation
[24:31.920 --> 24:36.280]  when it is forced inoculation, and they're going to add toxic oils to it to sterilize
[24:36.280 --> 24:37.280]  you.
[24:37.280 --> 24:38.280]  What's they're doing now?
[24:38.280 --> 24:45.760]  Because I'm reading the damn patents on the UN sponsored vaccine sterilants.
[24:45.760 --> 24:50.320]  Just type in vaccines to sterilize humans, you'll get the UN patents.
[24:50.320 --> 24:59.040]  Oh, but instead you'll see some leftist, oh, you're just anti-science as they take the
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.040]  franken shot.
[25:02.040 --> 25:05.640]  Remember back when it was bad to just change the tomatoes genetics or change corn genetics
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.440]  and would make the farm animals that ate it get sick?
[25:09.440 --> 25:13.920]  Well, now we just change your whole body, and all the top scientists come out, even the
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.720]  former head of Pfizer over a vaccine says this will cause heart attacks.
[25:17.720 --> 25:21.440]  He said that in December, within a week of them releasing some of the ingredients.
[25:21.440 --> 25:24.400]  He said, holy hell, look at all these studies.
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.400]  They previously tried to make these similar vaccines, it causes blood clots, it causes
[25:28.400 --> 25:34.200]  heart attacks, it causes strokes, it causes it to eat your own lungs, and now it's happening.
[25:34.200 --> 25:40.400]  Oh, oh, oh, I haven't even gotten to it yet.
[25:40.400 --> 25:41.400]  Look at this.
[25:41.400 --> 25:44.120]  It's a 20 minute video from Project Veritas.
[25:44.120 --> 25:47.800]  I'm having it posted in the live show feed today under my feed.
[25:47.800 --> 25:52.320]  Wow, this is the holy grail.
[25:52.320 --> 25:57.880]  They actually gave them the documents, Veritas, and they've confirmed these are their documents,
[25:57.880 --> 26:03.880]  hundreds of pages where they say even if it's true and someone got sick or died, you are
[26:03.880 --> 26:09.400]  to suppress it because it's for the greater good that some die for the whole.
[26:09.400 --> 26:15.040]  That's what I was told by the deputy director of the Texas Health Department, who lives
[26:15.040 --> 26:16.040]  here in Austin.
[26:16.040 --> 26:22.160]  I was on a hike and bike trail, hill of life, eight, nine years ago, and it's a big, it's
[26:22.160 --> 26:23.160]  called a hill.
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.080]  It's this big hill that goes down to the Barton Creek.
[26:27.080 --> 26:32.040]  It's about a three-tenths of a mile tall, long, and I'm in the morning, nobody else
[26:32.040 --> 26:34.400]  is there, and he goes, Alex, he goes, hey, I'm such and such.
[26:34.400 --> 26:35.400]  He said his name.
[26:35.400 --> 26:36.400]  I later searched into his name.
[26:36.400 --> 26:37.400]  It was who he said.
[26:37.400 --> 26:38.400]  He goes, I'm the deputy head of the Texas Health Department.
[26:38.400 --> 26:41.440]  He goes, listen, we know it kills and hurts a lot of people, but overall, it helps more
[26:41.440 --> 26:46.520]  than it does, and so we do lie to folks, but he doesn't help more than hurt.
[26:46.520 --> 26:47.520]  It's all a damn lie.
[26:47.520 --> 26:48.600]  It's all eugenics.
[26:48.600 --> 26:51.400]  They're all in on it, and here's Facebook admittingly doing it.
[26:51.400 --> 26:53.600]  They suppress medical doctors and expose the truth.
[26:53.600 --> 26:58.200]  They're in on the murdering.
[26:58.200 --> 27:04.080]  I'm giving you a status report on what your support of Info Wars has done.
[27:04.080 --> 27:08.200]  We are kicking globalist ass up and down the planet right now.
[27:08.200 --> 27:13.200]  Their entire agenda of depopulation, poison vaccines, it's all coming out, and yes, I'm
[27:13.200 --> 27:16.200]  risking my life, and yes, this is very dangerous, but it's worth it.
[27:16.200 --> 27:19.880]  I'm very honored to be in the fight, so thanks for keeping me in the fight, and our great
[27:19.880 --> 27:23.880]  crew here at Info Wars, and here's the other good news.

[28:02.280 --> 28:04.960]  got some really, really, really, really, really good news.
[28:04.960 --> 28:09.000]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about how the Globals are getting exposed, and how
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.160]  they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon, and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are
[28:13.160 --> 28:14.160]  in.
[28:14.160 --> 28:17.160]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the public president Biden
[28:17.160 --> 28:20.400]  and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine to try to make people wear masks.

[28:56.880 --> 28:57.880]  Haha!
[28:57.880 --> 29:01.000]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold
[29:01.000 --> 29:06.040]  out for 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 7 months, it's not a gimmick to make you buy the products.
[29:06.040 --> 29:10.760]  I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements
[29:10.760 --> 29:14.720]  and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation because they're great products that
[29:14.720 --> 29:17.360]  we're coming back and getting more and saying it for the support.
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.880]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's Polymblock or whether it's Supermobile
[29:21.880 --> 29:27.720]  Vitality or VasoBeats, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going
[29:27.720 --> 29:31.280]  to lower the quality of our products and so we just can't offer them.
[29:31.280 --> 29:36.360]  But thank God it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now because suddenly
[29:36.360 --> 29:39.360]  a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[29:39.360 --> 29:41.040]  And one of them is Polymblock.
[29:41.040 --> 29:45.720]  It takes a long time to get into Polymblock, but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like
[29:45.720 --> 29:46.720]  allergies.
[29:46.720 --> 29:52.400]  It's from France, it's a special proprietary system, this is the highest quality back-in-stock
[29:52.400 --> 29:59.400]  infowars store.com, store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points, check it out.
[30:52.400 --> 31:00.400]  Well, to say I am overwhelmed is putting it lightly.
[31:00.400 --> 31:13.560]  I mean, one of these stories is so huge I could spend the entire four-hour broadcast on it.
[31:13.560 --> 31:14.560]  Let's get into it right now.
[31:14.560 --> 31:19.360]  Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones Broadcast, weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[31:19.360 --> 31:24.640]  Central Standard Time.
[31:24.640 --> 31:30.600]  The system is making its move and it's trying to set the precedent to be able to put in
[31:30.600 --> 31:38.360]  your body what it wants, when it wants, how it wants, and use that to track and control
[31:38.360 --> 31:46.320]  every facet of your life and then suppress prestigious scientists, prestigious doctors,
[31:46.320 --> 31:51.600]  prestigious individuals and witnesses and victims of the main effects, not the side
[31:51.600 --> 31:58.120]  effects of these things they call vaccines that are not vaccines.
[31:58.120 --> 32:02.840]  Until about a year and a half ago, they had a different definition of a vaccine, and now
[32:02.840 --> 32:03.840]  they have a new one.
[32:03.840 --> 32:07.960]  It's called gene therapy.
[32:07.960 --> 32:14.200]  Vaccines of old had their problems, but there was science behind it, but they could taint
[32:14.200 --> 32:17.080]  them with things and they could add things to them.
[32:17.080 --> 32:21.000]  They could add something to what they had attenuated, the virus and the bacteria, and
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.720]  then if they added something else with it, your body would create an autoimmune response
[32:23.720 --> 32:30.120]  to that, and if they did it to something that was common in the environment, they could
[32:30.120 --> 32:35.880]  cripple you, or they could add a hormone that a woman only releases during certain parts
[32:35.880 --> 32:46.200]  of gestation or carrying the baby in her womb, in her uterus, and cause 100% miscarriages.
[32:46.200 --> 32:52.680]  But the new stuff is not a vaccine, and that's a fact.
[32:52.680 --> 32:59.320]  And so this article that's on infowars.com or projectveritas.com, breaking Facebook,
[32:59.320 --> 33:04.240]  whistleblowers, exposed leaked internal documents telling new effort to censor, to secretly
[33:04.240 --> 33:07.640]  censor vaccine concerns on a global scale.
[33:07.640 --> 33:11.680]  Well, none of it's secret because you see it everywhere.
[33:11.680 --> 33:18.320]  They're even censoring U.S. Senate hearings with scientists and gubernatorial commission
[33:18.320 --> 33:26.200]  hearings in the legislature of Florida and Texas and Idaho that I've seen.
[33:26.200 --> 33:33.320]  The latest one, again, was a medical doctor in a commission hearing in Florida, again,
[33:33.320 --> 33:34.320]  censored by Facebook.
[33:34.320 --> 33:36.000]  That was in the news yesterday.
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.240]  It's happening to everyone.
[33:38.240 --> 33:43.120]  But what gets more even evil is that when a woman dies or a man dies the vaccine, even
[33:43.120 --> 33:48.000]  young people, and their family says on their Facebook they died of the vaccine, that post
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.760]  is removed, and if they do it again, they remove their Facebook page.
[33:52.760 --> 33:57.280]  I guess they can keep, you know, the fact that they murdered somebody hidden.
[33:57.280 --> 34:00.320]  And then you learn that Facebook and these other big tech companies are heavily invested
[34:00.320 --> 34:01.960]  in the vaccines with Bill Gates.
[34:01.960 --> 34:08.480]  They're the big pharma company suppressing the people they victimized.
[34:08.480 --> 34:09.480]  And what is Facebook?
[34:09.480 --> 34:10.480]  What is Twitter?
[34:10.480 --> 34:11.480]  What is email?
[34:11.480 --> 34:12.480]  What is Google?
[34:12.480 --> 34:17.200]  It's the equivalent of the telephone or a radio, a walkie-talkie of old.
[34:17.200 --> 34:19.800]  It's how we communicate.
[34:19.800 --> 34:22.400]  Most people don't even have landlines anymore.
[34:22.400 --> 34:27.120]  What would you do if you tried to call 911 and say, my husband took the shot and he collapsed
[34:27.120 --> 34:32.160]  an hour later, and some of them said, sorry, you can't make that report, and you heard
[34:32.160 --> 34:38.120]  a dial tone, you'd say, that's tyranny, that's beyond North Korea.
[34:38.120 --> 34:43.560]  I can't even tell you what happened to my husband or my wife or my daughter or my son.
[34:43.560 --> 34:44.560]  And here it is.
[34:44.560 --> 34:48.320]  And they say, we must censor even true events and facts.
[34:48.320 --> 34:53.040]  These are quotes.
[34:53.040 --> 34:57.080]  True events and facts.
[34:57.080 --> 35:03.600]  Imagine the evil of a company where they admit on paper to thousands of censors that work
[35:03.600 --> 35:07.840]  for them, leftists who were trained by the Southern Primary Law Center in ADL the last
[35:07.840 --> 35:08.840]  five years.
[35:08.840 --> 35:10.760]  That's who trained them.
[35:10.760 --> 35:14.920]  They trained over a million of them now.
[35:14.920 --> 35:18.960]  They say in this 20-minute video, this is Project Veritas, it's also at m4works.com,
[35:18.960 --> 35:20.720]  they say, we can't believe this is happening.
[35:20.720 --> 35:25.600]  They've got to do something, and they say, you can't believe the stuff that we censor
[35:25.600 --> 35:27.320]  before it ever gets live.
[35:27.320 --> 35:30.760]  Oh, that's the other key.
[35:30.760 --> 35:32.600]  They're all key.
[35:32.600 --> 35:40.600]  They're censoring truth, true events and facts for the greater good, they say, in just five
[35:40.600 --> 35:41.600]  means, Machiavelli.
[35:41.600 --> 35:45.720]  Well, the statistics don't even show that's true.
[35:45.720 --> 35:47.720]  That's how dictators always take over.
[35:47.720 --> 35:51.240]  It gets much worse.
[35:51.240 --> 35:58.400]  They say that it's freaking them out and that you read it, watch the video, because they're
[35:58.400 --> 36:03.040]  seeing stuff that never gets out when the people post articles or post links or post
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.600]  videos of themselves convulsing or their dead mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers
[36:08.600 --> 36:15.280]  or their dead children, or they put up about a funeral, there's thousands and thousands
[36:15.280 --> 36:19.120]  of things you'll never see.
[36:19.120 --> 36:22.400]  And the victims that do the normal thing, let's say you're in a little village, you
[36:22.400 --> 36:25.480]  come to a village, you go to get water out of a well, they go, no, no, sir, don't drink
[36:25.480 --> 36:28.280]  out of that, it's a poison well.
[36:28.280 --> 36:31.600]  Or the little kid's trying to eat berries, my four-year-old daughter, we were hiking
[36:31.600 --> 36:35.400]  in the woods just a few days ago, she went over, started getting some berries off the
[36:35.400 --> 36:39.600]  plant that I knew were poisonous, and I said, sweetheart, that looks good, but it's poisonous.
[36:39.600 --> 36:46.160]  And she wanted to pick a mushroom and eat it, and I said, that's poisonous too, probably.
[36:46.160 --> 36:48.440]  That explained her about mushrooms, she's four years old.
[36:48.440 --> 36:53.760]  But imagine if I tried to do that in an invisible hand, reach down and cover my mouth, so these
[36:53.760 --> 36:59.920]  people are dying, they're being killed, they're getting sick.
[36:59.920 --> 37:04.120]  And this omnipresent system at Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, Google, all of it is
[37:04.120 --> 37:11.480]  live time, not letting it get out.
[37:11.480 --> 37:18.480]  Doctor's message about low pediatric deaths, if you don't exist from COVID, blocked by
[37:18.480 --> 37:24.920]  Facebook in testimony to a legislature, that's just yesterday.
[37:24.920 --> 37:31.200]  And it goes on and on and on, and now they're trying to censor Rand Paul clips, can't hear
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.520]  from a senator in America.
[37:37.520 --> 37:39.520]  This is evil, evil, evil.
[37:39.520 --> 37:40.800]  This is predatory to the max.
[37:40.800 --> 37:46.520]  You think Facebook's own deputy had, at the time, Sean Parker went public five years
[37:46.520 --> 37:51.600]  ago and he said, we designed Facebook to make you depressed and isolated and fully taken
[37:51.600 --> 37:52.600]  control of your life.
[37:52.600 --> 37:58.240]  And he laughed about it on the video, we played it here many times, and people said, oh, he's
[37:58.240 --> 37:59.600]  being nice, he's warning us.
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.680]  No, I've met Sean Parker, he wasn't being nice, he's super arrogant, he was rubbing
[38:04.680 --> 38:16.320]  it in your face.
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.720]  They're all about you fake jerks going along with the system, all right, I'm going to
[38:21.720 --> 38:24.760]  break, I'm going to come back with even more of the news, I'm going to play the videos
[38:24.760 --> 38:29.360]  of them giving little kids shots, and the government says, come to us, your parents
[38:29.360 --> 38:33.480]  can't stop you, and in local TV ads on cartoons, they say, come to your park, it's at every
[38:33.480 --> 38:37.320]  major park, the parents try to stop and the police go, you're not stopping them.
[38:37.320 --> 38:42.840]  That is totally illegal, but it's all a power grab, you go, well, they'll get in trouble.
[38:42.840 --> 38:46.120]  That's the whole point is they've gotten all the governments, all the corporations, and
[38:46.120 --> 38:51.720]  the bureaucrats and their minions to act in criminal mass, that's a war, that's an assault,
[38:51.720 --> 38:56.240]  and they think they're going to overpower you and break your will and stop you.
[38:56.240 --> 38:58.440]  And they're just going to do this to you.
[38:58.440 --> 39:02.160]  They're just going to come sexualize your children in cartoons, they're going to use
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.000]  Tony the Tiger to teach your son to have his genitals cut off, that's coming up next
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  hour.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.280]  You have these masked police and you shake hands in Canada, arresting you, that's where
[39:13.280 --> 39:18.320]  they're coming here, that's just because the people submit there, so that's what happens.
[39:18.320 --> 39:23.440]  The left are a sick cult showing you how much they love big pharma and love the big banks
[39:23.440 --> 39:29.000]  and tell you that they're radicals and they're rebels when they're the stupidest, alone, conformist
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.760]  the planet has ever seen, and they're always seeking more approval from AI avatars that
[39:35.760 --> 39:36.760]  aren't even humans.
[39:36.760 --> 39:40.720]  It doesn't matter to them, Sean Parker laughs at them, it doesn't matter to them that Mark
[39:40.720 --> 39:45.040]  Zuckerberg laughs at them, they love it, and now they're being organized as contract tracers
[39:45.040 --> 39:49.840]  into the armies that are coming to your house with gunmen to make you take it.
[39:49.840 --> 39:52.800]  This is war, this is war.
[39:52.800 --> 39:59.800]  You in globalist defopulation war, it's here.
[39:59.800 --> 40:01.800]  Your voice counts.
[40:01.800 --> 40:06.800]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[40:06.800 --> 40:11.640]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry, and now to get around
[40:11.640 --> 40:15.920]  big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.

[40:54.360 --> 41:01.240]  You know, I'm cutting an ad right now, and I've been here on the Saturday cutting days,
[41:01.240 --> 41:06.600]  I've done a terrible job, because I just cut like five ads, and I didn't tell people the
[41:06.600 --> 41:08.280]  most important part.
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.600]  No, it's not that DNA Force Plus has been sold out for seven months, and it's back in
[41:13.600 --> 41:15.360]  stock, and it's 40% off.
[41:15.360 --> 41:19.200]  Or how the supply chain broke down, and how it almost bankrupted us, but thank God, it
[41:19.200 --> 41:20.400]  finally came in.
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.360]  Or how it cleans up your mitochondria, and makes your telomeres last longer, and can
[41:24.360 --> 41:25.360]  regrow nerves.
[41:25.360 --> 41:27.200]  You've got to go research DNA Force Plus.
[41:27.200 --> 41:28.200]  No, it's not that.
[41:28.200 --> 41:32.640]  The reason I just cut all those ads, and forgot the most important point, the super-low
[41:32.640 --> 41:34.600]  vitality is back in stock, 50% off.
[41:34.600 --> 41:36.560]  The prostate is back 40% off.
[41:36.560 --> 41:39.000]  The alpha power is back 50% off.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.440]  The ultra-12, vitamin B-12, take it out of the tongue, it's incredible, is back also
[41:43.440 --> 41:46.520]  50% off, or vaso beats back 50% off.
[41:46.520 --> 41:47.520]  No.
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.720]  It's then, we've got double-patria points, and free shipping store-wide, double-patria
[41:51.720 --> 41:58.320]  points, free shipping store-wide on top of the huge sales.
[41:58.320 --> 42:05.480]  We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials, and right now we've got store-wide free shipping.
[42:05.480 --> 42:11.320]  We've got double-patria points, we've got 40% off on DNA Force Plus, sold out for seven
[42:11.320 --> 42:12.320]  months.
[42:12.320 --> 42:17.440]  50% off on ultra-12, 50% off on vaso beats, 50% off on alpha power.
[42:17.440 --> 42:18.440]  These are all incredible products.
[42:18.440 --> 42:22.080]  I can talk about each one for several minutes, but a lot of you've already used them, some
[42:22.080 --> 42:23.080]  of you haven't.
[42:23.080 --> 42:24.080]  You've got to go check these out.
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.920]  These are all top-of-the-line formulas, some of them clones of best-sellers, others, original
[42:28.920 --> 42:33.520]  formulations that we came up with, with top developers to blow people away, and it's
[42:33.520 --> 42:34.520]  all there.
[42:34.520 --> 42:39.160]  There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales
[42:39.160 --> 42:44.280]  and specials to mention them all here today, but whatever you do, go to infoworkstore.com
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.600]  with a store-wide free shipping, and double-patria points, and sold out for seven months.
[42:48.600 --> 42:53.760]  DNA Force Plus, with the PQQ and the CoQ10, that's been sold out, is now back in stock
[42:53.760 --> 42:58.760]  40% off, infoworkstore.com.
[42:58.760 --> 43:04.160]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[43:04.160 --> 43:10.000]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S., injected healthy men, women, and children
[43:10.000 --> 43:16.280]  with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing
[43:16.280 --> 43:18.280]  many of the test subjects.
[43:18.280 --> 43:22.680]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[43:22.680 --> 43:26.440]  14 years ago, we tracked and documented the Boulderburg Group's activities, and they're
[43:26.440 --> 43:29.800]  planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[43:29.800 --> 43:31.320]  The film now is more important than ever.
[43:31.320 --> 43:34.240]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[43:34.240 --> 43:38.920]  We have it back in print, available now at infoworkstore.com, selling them as low as
[43:38.920 --> 43:43.320]  $3.95 a piece with a bottom and bulk, and there's a zero-country code, so anywhere on
[43:43.320 --> 43:44.320]  the planet, you can make copies.
[43:44.320 --> 43:46.240]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[43:46.240 --> 43:52.080]  You are the Paul Revere's, 1776 Worldwide, 1776 Worldwide, in-game blueprint for global
[43:52.080 --> 44:00.560]  enslavement, available now at infoworkstore.com.
[44:00.560 --> 44:09.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[44:09.840 --> 44:34.520]  They get all these leftists, all these anti-human, globalist minions, useful idiots, signed on
[44:34.520 --> 44:39.120]  to lies, and they're so invested in the fraud, they can't admit.
[44:39.120 --> 44:44.720]  That they bought into a scam, just like the Nigerian phone scams, the email scams.
[44:44.720 --> 44:50.560]  I watched the documentary last night, the one on that fire festival they had out in
[44:50.560 --> 44:54.840]  the Bahamas, total scam, and then all the yuppies showed up, they were part of something
[44:54.840 --> 44:57.800]  special and got ripped off.
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.680]  The New World Order is exactly like that, except it kills you when it's done with you.
[45:02.680 --> 45:08.960]  An exact type of idiot signed on to it, but now, the deeper they get into the scam, they're
[45:08.960 --> 45:12.400]  told, you've got to bring everybody with you, that will build the utopia.
[45:12.400 --> 45:16.760]  It's like Satan and his fallen angels want us to go with them, whether you believe in
[45:16.760 --> 45:20.800]  that or think it's an allegory, at the end of the day, it's all being manifest.
[45:20.800 --> 45:25.160]  All right, I want to go into these videos that I just mentioned, I want to show you
[45:25.160 --> 45:30.960]  what I've just talked about, I mean, ice cream trucks, maybe find an ice cream truck music
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.440]  to play in the background in a moment, or I remember, is that ice cream truck sound
[45:34.440 --> 45:41.460]  when you were a kid ding-ding-ding-ding, I can't make it sound, but I was playing some
[45:41.460 --> 45:48.000]  Russian techno once on there, and really goes, what's that, he's on the show, he goes,
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.780]  that sounds like ice cream trucks, but that's not the ice cream truck music, I mean, the
[45:51.780 --> 45:57.400]  classic ice cream trucks, they have ice cream trucks, not just vaccine centers.
[45:57.400 --> 46:03.180]  Ice cream trucks going around and the kids run out and they give them injections.
[46:03.180 --> 46:05.620]  It says in the articles, I've got them right here.
[46:05.620 --> 46:08.660]  Yahoo Finance, all of them, that the kids run up
[46:08.660 --> 46:09.820]  and parents try to stop them
[46:09.820 --> 46:11.900]  and police follow the ice cream trucks.
[46:11.900 --> 46:15.420]  I mean, this is so illegal, so criminal,
[46:15.420 --> 46:19.100]  so child molester-ish, and that's what it is.
[46:19.100 --> 46:22.300]  They're gonna not molest you by groping your child.
[46:22.300 --> 46:24.540]  That's bad enough, they'd survive it, though.
[46:24.540 --> 46:26.260]  Wraping your child, they'd give them HIV
[46:26.260 --> 46:27.780]  or hepatitis, they'd survive.
[46:27.780 --> 46:31.540]  No, no, they're gonna rape you with a GMO Franken shot
[46:31.540 --> 46:34.940]  from Bill Gates and the UN and Klaus Schwab
[46:34.940 --> 46:37.180]  that say they're gonna take over our genetics
[46:37.180 --> 46:38.740]  and there's too many of us.
[46:38.740 --> 46:41.060]  That'll pull many people.
[46:41.060 --> 46:43.860]  I agree with Bill Gates, we need to sterilize you.
[46:43.860 --> 46:46.580]  Oh, good, I'm here with an ice cream truck with your shot.
[46:47.740 --> 46:49.060]  Lot of told people 10 years ago
[46:49.060 --> 46:50.860]  they're gonna have ice cream trucks driving around
[46:50.860 --> 46:52.340]  giving you experimental shots.
[46:53.740 --> 46:54.900]  There it is.
[46:54.900 --> 46:56.100]  You wouldn't believe it.
[46:56.100 --> 46:59.860]  And I've got some of the videos
[46:59.860 --> 47:01.660]  they're dressed up like clowns giving them shots.
[47:01.660 --> 47:03.980]  It's even creepier, like, ah, there are hundreds
[47:03.980 --> 47:07.260]  of businesses in Toronto alone are doing it.
[47:07.260 --> 47:09.540]  Just all over the world, it's the same crap.
[47:09.540 --> 47:12.260]  Freaky, weird, leftist, oh, we're gonna,
[47:12.260 --> 47:14.780]  come on, kids, don't listen to your parents.
[47:14.780 --> 47:17.340]  Oh, you like drag queen story time was good.
[47:17.340 --> 47:18.980]  You're gonna really like this.
[47:18.980 --> 47:23.340]  Get some blue bunny there, ha, how about some bluebell?
[47:24.420 --> 47:26.020]  Oh, this is bluebell, all right.
[47:26.020 --> 47:27.500]  You'll enjoy the hot attack.
[47:27.500 --> 47:32.380]  Ha, ha, ha, stick your hand down in the stool here.
[47:33.420 --> 47:36.060]  Are there clowns down there?
[47:36.060 --> 47:39.900]  Oh, yeah, there's clowns down here and ponies.
[47:39.900 --> 47:42.060]  They need to hurt your feelings.
[47:42.060 --> 47:44.100]  Oh my gosh, I'm gonna give that a moment.
[47:45.220 --> 47:47.660]  But first, we have some very exciting news.
[47:47.660 --> 47:49.780]  Yes, we haven't done this this year yet.
[47:49.780 --> 47:51.820]  We're six months into the year.
[47:51.820 --> 47:53.540]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[47:53.540 --> 47:59.380]  store-wide free shipping infowarstore.com.
[47:59.380 --> 48:04.060]  Store-wide free shipping infowarstore.com.
[48:04.060 --> 48:06.780]  You know, I gotta stop, something just hit me.
[48:06.780 --> 48:09.820]  And I actually told people this, so I'm on record.
[48:09.820 --> 48:11.500]  My instincts are just insane.
[48:11.500 --> 48:13.180]  I'm bragging, it's just weird.
[48:14.420 --> 48:16.940]  About two weeks ago, I even said this on air.
[48:16.940 --> 48:17.780]  We ought to find it.
[48:17.780 --> 48:19.540]  I said, I'm thinking about driving around
[48:19.540 --> 48:21.620]  in the armored vehicle, but it is,
[48:21.620 --> 48:25.260]  but in like a weird leftist disguise with rainbow flags.
[48:25.260 --> 48:27.700]  And say, everyone take your shots, they're good.
[48:27.700 --> 48:29.380]  We need to die for the earth.
[48:29.380 --> 48:30.940]  And use the reverse psychology,
[48:30.940 --> 48:32.900]  but admit what the shots do,
[48:32.900 --> 48:36.060]  but just read globalist quotes about the population
[48:36.060 --> 48:37.660]  while I'm in the armored vehicle.
[48:38.940 --> 48:41.940]  And then one of the crew members was at Owen says,
[48:41.940 --> 48:43.460]  yeah, but you're too recognizable
[48:43.460 --> 48:44.380]  that they'll know it's you.
[48:44.380 --> 48:47.700]  And I thought, yeah, instead we'll get an ice cream truck
[48:47.700 --> 48:50.420]  and I'll be a clown and I'll go out and say,
[48:50.420 --> 48:53.100]  I've got your deadly shot and get out with the shots
[48:53.100 --> 48:56.140]  and scare people instead to actually have clowns
[48:56.140 --> 48:58.500]  and ice cream trucks and they're doing it.
[49:02.060 --> 49:03.380]  I told a lot of that on air,
[49:03.380 --> 49:05.500]  but behind the scenes I was planning this.
[49:05.500 --> 49:06.860]  I was thinking about doing it this Saturday
[49:06.860 --> 49:09.420]  because I've been out of town last week.
[49:09.420 --> 49:11.020]  In fact, I'd even told security be ready
[49:11.020 --> 49:15.100]  because we were gonna doll up to creepy looking vans.
[49:15.100 --> 49:19.980]  We gotta find the vans and then drive around as clowns
[49:19.980 --> 49:21.260]  and get out with needles.
[49:23.300 --> 49:24.980]  But actually the left would like run up with their kids
[49:24.980 --> 49:26.060]  and say, please, please.
[49:26.060 --> 49:28.940]  I mean, they're so Stockholm syndrome.
[49:28.940 --> 49:30.420]  God, I can get out the grim reaper outfit.
[49:30.420 --> 49:33.820]  They go, they would cream themselves.
[49:35.780 --> 49:39.180]  God, I think of the most creepy thing I can
[49:39.180 --> 49:40.700]  and then they're doing it.
[49:40.700 --> 49:43.620]  I mean, it's like the drag queen story time.
[49:43.620 --> 49:47.180]  It's big, giant, fat convicted pedophiles in most cases
[49:47.180 --> 49:49.060]  with erections with little kids
[49:49.060 --> 49:51.580]  bouncing on their erections through their pants.
[49:51.580 --> 49:56.060]  I mean, when I show the video that's on news,
[49:56.060 --> 49:57.980]  stations don't like it, I get why,
[49:57.980 --> 50:00.460]  but it's the children this is being done to.
[50:03.060 --> 50:05.500]  All right, let me get back to this.
[50:05.500 --> 50:06.500]  Because this is good news.
[50:06.500 --> 50:08.820]  We have been in the red so far this year,
[50:10.020 --> 50:13.620]  but despite that, I have liquidated any backup cash
[50:13.620 --> 50:15.220]  I had and put it in just knowing it's our mission
[50:15.220 --> 50:18.260]  to expose this, but thank God, despite the COVID lockdowns
[50:18.260 --> 50:21.380]  and the supply chain, we finally got DNA Force Plus
[50:21.380 --> 50:24.940]  back in stock and my friend's DNA Force Plus
[50:24.940 --> 50:28.700]  has the strongest, highest quality CoQ10 and PQQ
[50:28.700 --> 50:32.940]  that clean out your cells, repair your mitochondria,
[50:32.940 --> 50:35.260]  make your telomeres last longer,
[50:35.260 --> 50:37.140]  and that's the fountain of youth.
[50:37.140 --> 50:39.420]  It's even documented to do nerve regrowth,
[50:39.420 --> 50:40.260]  but if you have an old injury
[50:40.260 --> 50:41.660]  that didn't hurt anymore because the nerve died,
[50:41.660 --> 50:43.380]  the pain might come back in some cases,
[50:43.380 --> 50:44.700]  but then go away later.
[50:44.700 --> 50:46.700]  My finger was chopped off and then they reattached it.
[50:46.700 --> 50:50.220]  It was like eight years into having it chopped off.
[50:50.220 --> 50:51.060]  It had no feeling.
[50:51.060 --> 50:52.980]  And I went on DNA Force like six years ago
[50:52.980 --> 50:54.860]  and all of a sudden my finger got numb.
[50:54.860 --> 50:57.340]  And in four months, the nerve grew back
[50:57.340 --> 50:58.900]  and that has full feeling.
[50:58.900 --> 50:59.860]  In fact, doing overhead shot,
[50:59.860 --> 51:01.660]  let me show people where my finger was cut off.
[51:01.660 --> 51:03.500]  You see this right here, folks?
[51:03.500 --> 51:05.620]  That sucker got cut off, falling off a boat
[51:05.620 --> 51:06.620]  to help us some folks.
[51:06.620 --> 51:07.940]  This boat was on fire.
[51:07.940 --> 51:10.620]  I was with Kevin Booth, filmmaker.
[51:10.620 --> 51:12.420]  Bill Hicks is a former producer,
[51:12.420 --> 51:14.340]  so that's what I think I'm Bill Hicks.
[51:14.340 --> 51:17.540]  But that happened and boy, it cut that sucker off.
[51:17.540 --> 51:19.260]  It was hanging by a piece of skin over here,
[51:19.260 --> 51:21.620]  but it was, you know, the bone was cut, everything.
[51:21.620 --> 51:26.460]  And it was all numb up to the tip of the finger,
[51:26.460 --> 51:28.780]  but after taking DNA Force Plus,
[51:28.780 --> 51:30.220]  I was three, four months, I forget.
[51:30.220 --> 51:31.300]  I was like, it was tingling.
[51:31.300 --> 51:32.140]  And then I was telling him,
[51:32.140 --> 51:32.980]  hey, what's happening?
[51:32.980 --> 51:35.740]  And Dr. Ripp goes, I told you, grow by nerves.
[51:37.020 --> 51:38.180]  It did what he said.
[51:38.180 --> 51:41.580]  Crazy, very, very crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:41.580 --> 51:44.980]  So, it's powerful, it's amazing.
[51:44.980 --> 51:47.260]  It has a bunch of other known ingredients
[51:47.260 --> 51:48.100]  to clean out your cells.
[51:48.100 --> 51:49.300]  It's next level.
[51:50.140 --> 51:52.900]  And they sell similar formulas at doctor's clinics
[51:52.900 --> 51:55.380]  as a nutraceutical for three times the cost.
[51:55.380 --> 51:57.980]  But I mean, it costs us a lot of money to produce this.
[51:57.980 --> 52:00.180]  That's why it has a higher level price tag on it.
[52:00.180 --> 52:01.460]  But it's back and stock's been sold out
[52:01.460 --> 52:02.500]  for months and months and months.
[52:02.500 --> 52:05.500]  40% off, pollen block, back and stock, 40% off.
[52:05.500 --> 52:07.940]  For no locality, back and stock, 50% off.

[52:10.460 --> 52:12.300]  Alpha Power, you know, came back in a few weeks ago,
[52:12.300 --> 52:14.260]  but it's 50% off.
[52:14.260 --> 52:15.860]  Ultra 12 came back a few months ago.
[52:15.860 --> 52:17.460]  It's 50% off.
[52:17.460 --> 52:19.220]  Vaso beats got back in stock.
[52:19.220 --> 52:20.060]  50% off.

[52:27.340 --> 52:28.380]  out there.
[52:28.380 --> 52:30.580]  Ionic Fizzy Magnesium Drink Mix.
[52:30.580 --> 52:34.540]  Still 40% off out of the gates, 1995.
[52:35.820 --> 52:38.460]  And this is our Memorial Day special
[52:38.460 --> 52:40.780]  for our veterans that have fought and died for us.
[52:40.780 --> 52:43.660]  I wanna just pass on big discounts to everybody out there
[52:43.660 --> 52:44.940]  and remind people that freedom isn't free
[52:44.940 --> 52:46.780]  and your funding of this operation
[52:46.780 --> 52:49.540]  is funding information warfare.
[52:49.540 --> 52:51.260]  So it could not be a more critical place
[52:51.260 --> 52:53.020]  to spend your money.
[52:53.020 --> 52:56.260]  Plus, that magnesium fizzy drink gives you energy
[52:56.260 --> 52:59.100]  in the morning, helps you sleep better at night.
[52:59.100 --> 53:00.500]  It just totally smooths you out,
[53:00.500 --> 53:01.340]  gives you more clarity.
[53:01.340 --> 53:02.180]  People have been saying, Alex,
[53:02.180 --> 53:03.580]  why do you have so much energy?
[53:03.580 --> 53:04.700]  Why are you doing so much better than you were
[53:04.700 --> 53:05.860]  just a few months ago?
[53:05.860 --> 53:07.100]  Well, a lot of this stuff's sold out.
[53:07.100 --> 53:09.540]  I found an old bottle of DNA force got back on it.
[53:09.540 --> 53:10.940]  The fizzy stuff got in.
[53:10.940 --> 53:14.300]  I remembered to take my X2 religiously every day
[53:14.300 --> 53:15.340]  and I've been doing that.
[53:15.340 --> 53:17.660]  And it's just incredible.
[53:17.660 --> 53:18.900]  Infowarsstore.com.
[53:18.900 --> 53:19.740]  And I'm just like you.
[53:19.740 --> 53:20.580]  I remember to take the stuff
[53:20.580 --> 53:23.620]  and I forget to take it and it just goes like that.
[53:23.620 --> 53:25.540]  So you gotta remember to put it on a lazy Susan
[53:25.540 --> 53:27.260]  at your breakfast table or your dining room
[53:27.260 --> 53:30.700]  or by your nightstand or by your sink in the bathroom.
[53:30.700 --> 53:33.180]  Wherever you keep stuff you take every day.
[53:33.180 --> 53:34.300]  And I'm a big guy too.
[53:34.300 --> 53:35.620]  I take an aspirin every day.
[53:35.620 --> 53:36.460]  That's a smart thing to do.
[53:36.460 --> 53:37.860]  I don't sell aspirin.
[53:37.860 --> 53:39.020]  But it certainly is good for everything.
[53:39.020 --> 53:39.940]  I'm not your doctor.
[53:39.940 --> 53:40.860]  This is what I do.
[53:41.820 --> 53:42.820]  This is all great stuff.
[53:42.820 --> 53:44.420]  Infowarsstore.com.
[53:44.420 --> 53:45.860]  Memorial Day mega sale is here.
[53:45.860 --> 53:46.740]  Storewide free shipping.
[53:46.740 --> 53:47.580]  Oh, I forgot.
[53:47.580 --> 53:49.460]  Double patriot points.
[53:49.460 --> 53:51.660]  Haven't done a sale like this since Christmas.
[53:51.660 --> 53:53.140]  We should have sales like this twice a year.
[53:53.140 --> 53:54.900]  We'll probably bring this back in November.
[53:54.900 --> 53:57.460]  But this is the biggest sale so far of the year.
[53:57.460 --> 53:58.900]  DNA Force Plus back in stock.
[53:58.900 --> 54:01.660]  Polyblock is a whole proprietary system.
[54:01.660 --> 54:04.500]  They discovered more than 40 years ago in France
[54:04.500 --> 54:06.420]  that the local French didn't get allergies
[54:06.420 --> 54:09.180]  that were eating the eggs of a particular type of quail.
[54:09.180 --> 54:10.220]  Well, they ate other quail eggs.
[54:10.220 --> 54:11.060]  It didn't work.
[54:11.060 --> 54:14.420]  The quail ate a certain plant for proprietary in the French.
[54:14.420 --> 54:15.620]  We buy this from France.
[54:15.620 --> 54:17.060]  We package it here in the US.
[54:17.060 --> 54:18.260]  So most of our stuff's made in the US.
[54:18.260 --> 54:20.660]  This is made in France or the raw stuff comes from France.
[54:20.660 --> 54:22.820]  Special kind of quail, special diet.
[54:22.820 --> 54:25.340]  And it creates something naturally in the egg shells
[54:25.340 --> 54:26.860]  particularly but also in the egg.
[54:26.860 --> 54:27.980]  This is a mix of both.
[54:27.980 --> 54:28.820]  Actually tastes good.
[54:28.820 --> 54:29.780]  It's crazy.
[54:29.780 --> 54:31.740]  You just chew them up your mouth and swallow it.
[54:31.740 --> 54:33.660]  And it's incredible.
[54:33.660 --> 54:35.660]  It works as good for me as a major antihistamine does
[54:35.660 --> 54:36.620]  but it's all natural.
[54:36.620 --> 54:39.220]  So Polyblock back in stock, 40% off free shipping.
[54:39.220 --> 54:41.380]  InfoWareShore.com and it funds the InfoWare.
[54:41.380 --> 54:42.460]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[54:42.460 --> 54:44.460]  I got some funny stuff to cover as well.
[54:46.660 --> 54:48.180]  I don't really need to sell you
[54:48.180 --> 54:51.260]  on how beet concentrate is really good for your heart,
[54:51.260 --> 54:52.700]  good for your liver, good for your lungs,
[54:52.700 --> 54:55.220]  good for your cardiovascular system of your brain.
[54:55.220 --> 54:57.700]  It's well known and so beet supplements
[54:57.700 --> 54:59.580]  are amongst the best sellers out there.
[54:59.580 --> 55:01.380]  So I went out to a top lab and I said,
[55:01.380 --> 55:03.860]  what is the strongest beet concentrate?
[55:03.860 --> 55:06.660]  You can do a copy of the popular formula you have.
[55:06.660 --> 55:09.140]  And they explained that their formula had a certain percentage
[55:09.140 --> 55:12.100]  and I said, just like with body's ultimate turmeric formula
[55:12.100 --> 55:14.820]  for the average competitors at five per secret humanoid.
[55:14.820 --> 55:17.380]  I said, no one else does 95, that's the highest level.
[55:17.380 --> 55:19.380]  I said, give me 95 per secret humanoid.
[55:19.380 --> 55:21.180]  Didn't even cost much more.
[55:21.180 --> 55:23.420]  And we have 95 per secret humanoid.
[55:23.420 --> 55:24.540]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[55:24.540 --> 55:27.420]  This is a very strong beet extract
[55:27.420 --> 55:29.220]  and it's very good for your body, good for your heart
[55:29.220 --> 55:30.140]  and it's back in stock.
[55:30.140 --> 55:34.860]  Hazelbeats at infowarstore.com 50% off.
[55:34.860 --> 55:37.900]  Turbo forces back in, DNA forces back in,

[55:42.460 --> 55:43.980]  and their store wide free shipping
[55:43.980 --> 55:46.740]  and double patriot points for the week of Memorial Day.
[55:48.220 --> 55:50.540]  I'm giving you a status report
[55:50.540 --> 55:53.980]  on what your support of info wars has done.
[55:53.980 --> 55:58.100]  We are kicking globalist ass up and down the planet right now.
[55:58.100 --> 56:01.500]  Their entire agenda of depopulation, poison vaccines,
[56:01.500 --> 56:02.540]  it's all coming out.
[56:02.540 --> 56:05.380]  And yes, I'm risking my life and yes, this is very dangerous
[56:05.380 --> 56:06.220]  but it's worth it.
[56:06.220 --> 56:07.580]  I'm very honored to be in the fight.
[56:07.580 --> 56:09.460]  So thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[56:09.460 --> 56:11.740]  And our great crew here at info wars.
[56:11.740 --> 56:13.780]  And here's the other good news.
[56:13.780 --> 56:16.220]  This has been sold out for seven months.
[56:16.220 --> 56:18.900]  It's got the highest quality PQQ CoQ10
[56:18.900 --> 56:21.500]  that's so good for your cells, your mitochondria,
[56:21.500 --> 56:24.180]  your telomeres, your nerves, everything.
[56:24.180 --> 56:26.740]  PQQ, the CoQ10, look at the other ingredients.
[56:26.740 --> 56:27.740]  They all go together.
[56:27.740 --> 56:29.860]  This incredible formula, our number one best seller,
[56:29.860 --> 56:30.860]  it's sold out for seven months,
[56:30.860 --> 56:34.860]  is now back in stock, 40% off at infowarstore.com.
[56:34.860 --> 56:39.220]  DNA Force Plus, back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[56:39.220 --> 56:42.140]  And it funds the info war at true 361.

[56:44.660 --> 56:46.900]  or 40% off DNA Force Plus.
[56:46.900 --> 56:53.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:01.900 --> 57:03.900]  All right, I got a lot more serious news to cover.
[57:03.900 --> 57:07.900]  And I still haven't played the insane ice cream trucks
[57:07.900 --> 57:10.500]  driving around Canada injecting kids
[57:10.500 --> 57:12.620]  when the parents find out and try to fight back.
[57:12.620 --> 57:15.660]  The police come and get between the kids and the kids.
[57:15.660 --> 57:17.540]  A lot of them freak out and go against their parents
[57:17.540 --> 57:19.660]  because they see the authority figure of the police.
[57:19.660 --> 57:21.740]  So this is real Stockholm syndrome,
[57:21.740 --> 57:23.860]  kicking in that's coming up.
[57:23.860 --> 57:25.780]  Then I'm gonna hit some very sad news,
[57:25.780 --> 57:26.860]  but it's also very, very funny.
[57:26.860 --> 57:29.340]  So I'm gonna, pledging each day,
[57:29.340 --> 57:30.900]  and I'm asking the great producers in there
[57:30.900 --> 57:32.900]  to remind me to do this,
[57:32.900 --> 57:34.700]  to do something positive and fun
[57:34.700 --> 57:37.180]  and laugh at the globalist agenda.
[57:37.180 --> 57:39.500]  And some of the great tweets people put out.
[57:39.500 --> 57:44.500]  But it turns out there's now a gay frog mascot for Kellogg's.
[57:44.500 --> 57:48.500]  I wonder where they got the idea for that.
[57:48.500 --> 57:52.500]  Maybe this all is just a virtual reality thing.
[57:52.500 --> 57:54.500]  This is insane.
[57:54.500 --> 57:58.500]  But here's a report on Project Bluebeam.
[57:58.500 --> 58:00.500]  And then we'll be right back with all the news
[58:00.500 --> 58:01.500]  and so much more.
[58:01.500 --> 58:02.500]  Please stay with us.
[58:02.500 --> 58:04.500]  Henry Kissinger once said,
[58:04.500 --> 58:06.500]  today Americans would be outraged
[58:06.500 --> 58:09.500]  if United Nations troops entered Los Angeles
[58:09.500 --> 58:10.500]  to restore order.
[58:10.500 --> 58:12.500]  Tomorrow they will be grateful.
[58:12.500 --> 58:14.500]  This is especially true if they were told
[58:14.500 --> 58:17.500]  there was an outside threat from beyond.
[58:17.500 --> 58:19.500]  Whether real or promulgated,
[58:19.500 --> 58:21.500]  that threatened our very existence.
[58:21.500 --> 58:23.500]  It is then that all peoples of the world
[58:23.500 --> 58:25.500]  will plead with world leaders
[58:25.500 --> 58:27.500]  to deliver them from this evil.
[58:27.500 --> 58:31.500]  The one thing every man fears is the unknown.
[58:31.500 --> 58:33.500]  When presented with this scenario,
[58:33.500 --> 58:36.500]  individual rights will be willingly relinquished
[58:36.500 --> 58:38.500]  for the guarantee of their well-being
[58:38.500 --> 58:41.500]  granted to them by their world government.
[58:41.500 --> 58:43.500]  And here America sits vulnerable
[58:43.500 --> 58:45.500]  from a pandemic subjugation
[58:45.500 --> 58:47.500]  that has terrorized our rights.
[58:47.500 --> 58:50.500]  White evangelicals 45% say they won't get vaccinated
[58:50.500 --> 58:52.500]  according to a Pew research.
[58:52.500 --> 58:55.500]  Republicans, almost 50% of Republicans
[58:55.500 --> 58:57.500]  are refusing to get the vaccine.
[58:57.500 --> 58:59.500]  So we won't reach herd immunity
[58:59.500 --> 59:01.500]  because of those particular groups.
[59:01.500 --> 59:04.500]  So I say we need to shun
[59:04.500 --> 59:06.500]  those that refuse to get vaccinated.
[59:06.500 --> 59:08.500]  Just like now in certain states,
[59:08.500 --> 59:10.500]  many states I know in New York,
[59:10.500 --> 59:13.500]  there are signs on store fronts,
[59:13.500 --> 59:16.500]  on businesses all across the state.
[59:16.500 --> 59:18.500]  No mask, no entry.
[59:18.500 --> 59:20.500]  I think if you have not been vaccinated,
[59:20.500 --> 59:22.500]  no entry.
[59:22.500 --> 59:25.500]  Infiltrated by decades of Marxist indoctrination
[59:25.500 --> 59:27.500]  that began in America's universities
[59:27.500 --> 59:30.500]  and has now permeated into America's elementary schools
[59:30.500 --> 59:32.500]  and destroyed our cities.
[59:32.500 --> 59:35.500]  While American police are increasingly unable
[59:35.500 --> 59:38.500]  to respond to 911 calls as their departments
[59:38.500 --> 59:40.500]  are hollowed out while criminals
[59:40.500 --> 59:42.500]  pour over our border.
[59:42.500 --> 59:44.500]  Yeah, please hurry because it sounds
[59:44.500 --> 59:46.500]  like she's being assaulted right now.
[59:46.500 --> 59:48.500]  It sounds like she's being raped currently.
[59:48.500 --> 59:50.500]  We'll be out there as soon as possible.
[59:50.500 --> 59:52.500]  As soon as possible on March 30th
[59:52.500 --> 59:54.500]  for the Salt Lake City Police Department,
[59:54.500 --> 59:56.500]  meant 28 minutes.
[59:56.500 --> 1:00:00.500]  The stage is set for Kissinger's United Nations troops
[1:00:00.500 --> 1:00:02.500]  to take center stage.
[1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.500]  But they need that one event
[1:00:04.500 --> 1:00:06.500]  that will undeniably convince the public
[1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:09.500]  that their very existence is threatened.
[1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:12.500]  The evidence of unidentified flying objects
[1:00:12.500 --> 1:00:14.500]  confronting the military is so prevalent
[1:00:14.500 --> 1:00:16.500]  that it is almost undeniable.
[1:00:16.500 --> 1:00:18.500]  Absolutely extraordinary and every day
[1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:20.500]  it seems like new information drops.
[1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:23.500]  Things that the public and the media weren't told.
[1:00:23.500 --> 1:00:26.500]  So for example, former director of national intelligence
[1:00:26.500 --> 1:00:29.500]  John Ratcliffe just threw into the conversation the other day
[1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:32.500]  the fact that the satellite imagery of all this
[1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:35.500]  and some of the speeds being reported
[1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:39.500]  seem to blow the theory about foreign drones out of the water.
[1:00:39.500 --> 1:00:42.500]  We must be told what's going on here
[1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:46.500]  and we should think of this upcoming report to Congress
[1:00:46.500 --> 1:00:50.500]  as an intelligence assessment of the phenomenon itself
[1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:53.500]  and one that's long overdue.
[1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:55.500]  But who's to say it isn't smoke and mirrors
[1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:58.500]  in order to unleash a more nefarious purpose,
[1:00:58.500 --> 1:01:00.500]  an invasion by global governance
[1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:02.500]  in the form of the Antichrist,
[1:01:02.500 --> 1:01:05.500]  the technology to create that illusion
[1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:07.500]  has long been available.
[1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:09.500]  Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:11.500]  Do I only hope?
[1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:14.500]  We've seen hologram technology move leaps and bounds
[1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.500]  over the last few years.
[1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:19.500]  Maybe you caught Jesse's look at 3D volumetric displays
[1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:20.500]  a few weeks ago.
[1:01:20.500 --> 1:01:22.500]  Now, researchers from the Interact Lab
[1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:24.500]  at the University of Sussex have created
[1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:28.500]  three-dimensional holograms you can hear and even feel.
[1:01:28.500 --> 1:01:31.500]  They call their device the Acoustic Trap Display
[1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:34.500]  Essentially, it's using sound to manipulate
[1:01:34.500 --> 1:01:37.500]  a tiny particle that traces out these images.
[1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:40.500]  And the New World Order is addicted to the big lie.
[1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:43.500]  So what is the biggest lie they can tell?
[1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:45.500]  John Bowne reported.
[1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:47.500]  Look, I don't really need to take by them.
[1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:57.500]  I've got some really good news for the viewers
[1:01:57.500 --> 1:01:59.500]  and listeners of this broadcast.
[1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:02.500]  And then I've got some really, really, really, really good news.
[1:02:02.500 --> 1:02:04.500]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about
[1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:06.500]  how the Globals are getting exposed
[1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:08.500]  and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon
[1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:11.500]  and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in.
[1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:13.500]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against
[1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:16.500]  the President Biden and saying we're going to have $1,000
[1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:18.500]  to try to make people wear masks.
[1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:21.500]  I can tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead
[1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:24.500]  tell you about the super good news concerning the M4 war?
[1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:27.500]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now
[1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:30.500]  the Memorial Day special for the next week only
[1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:34.500]  with store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points

[1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:52.500]  and it comes in four and it's incredible products
[1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:57.500]  and George Soros hates it! Ha-ha!
[1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:07.500]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:11.500]  we now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:14.500]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[1:03:14.500 --> 1:03:24.500]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:03:44.500 --> 1:03:54.500]  Get a mother up, get a mother down.
[1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:57.500]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, as we broadcast
[1:03:57.500 --> 1:04:02.500]  worldwide going into the storm at attack speed.
[1:04:02.500 --> 1:04:06.500]  Alright, I really want to take a lot of calls.
[1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:07.500]  Every day.
[1:04:07.500 --> 1:04:09.500]  We took a lot of calls yesterday, the callers were amazing.
[1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:12.500]  I'm going to open the phones up for the last 30 minutes
[1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:15.500]  of this hour because we have Craig Jones,
[1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:17.500]  who is the number one, number two, number three,
[1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:20.500]  depending on who you talk to, Jiu-Jitsu fighter in the world.
[1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:22.500]  I learned about him getting sick.
[1:04:22.500 --> 1:04:24.500]  When Joe Rogan sent me a text about it,
[1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:26.500]  his admins swole up when he took the,
[1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:29.500]  one of the COVID so-called vaccines.
[1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:31.500]  He's going to be in studio with us.
[1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:33.500]  And I follow UFC and follow Jiu-Jitsu,
[1:04:33.500 --> 1:04:35.500]  but I'm not a connoisseur,
[1:04:35.500 --> 1:04:37.500]  but I knew who Craig Jones was,
[1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:41.500]  but I appreciate Joe putting me in contact with him.
[1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:46.500]  So Craig Jones is going to be in studio coming up next hour.
[1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:49.500]  And I think he'll be here for two or three segments.
[1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:51.500]  Then I will continue on with your phone calls.
[1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:55.500]  And then Paul Joseph Watson is going to be hosting
[1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:58.500]  the fourth hour today.
[1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:00.500]  Paul Joseph Watson always has a splendid job
[1:05:00.500 --> 1:05:03.500]  from Summit.News over in the UK.
[1:05:03.500 --> 1:05:07.500]  And then I'm going to host tonight, 6 to 9 p.m.
[1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:10.500]  We can go as long as we want, commercial free.
[1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:12.500]  I mean, we may take a few breaks,
[1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:14.500]  play a few promos or a few news reports,
[1:05:14.500 --> 1:05:16.500]  but when I say commercial free,
[1:05:16.500 --> 1:05:17.500]  we're not going to be running set breaks
[1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:19.500]  like the radio and TV channels.
[1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:21.500]  We're going to pick up my show and the other shows,
[1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:24.500]  do the standard 14 minutes an hour for that.
[1:05:24.500 --> 1:05:26.500]  We're going to be running a special report
[1:05:26.500 --> 1:05:28.500]  that basically will go 30 minutes to an hour
[1:05:28.500 --> 1:05:30.500]  before we even take any breaks.
[1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:33.500]  And so it's the great debate, the Middle East in crisis,
[1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:34.500]  all the stuff we saw last week,
[1:05:34.500 --> 1:05:37.500]  what's ongoing between Robert Barnes and Nick Fuentes,
[1:05:37.500 --> 1:05:39.500]  both very well-spoken, very informed people.
[1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:42.500]  You can disagree with either one of their views
[1:05:42.500 --> 1:05:44.500]  on this or that or everything they say or nothing,
[1:05:44.500 --> 1:05:46.500]  but they are both very smart guys.
[1:05:46.500 --> 1:05:48.500]  They're not putting an act on it.
[1:05:48.500 --> 1:05:49.500]  They're smart.
[1:05:49.500 --> 1:05:52.500]  One is twice the age of Fuentes.
[1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:53.500]  Barnes is about the same age as I am,
[1:05:53.500 --> 1:05:56.500]  but Fuentes is definitely a smart guy.
[1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:58.500]  He's not mailing it in.
[1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:00.500]  He's not phoning it in.
[1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:02.500]  He's not faking it until he makes it.
[1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:06.500]  But Barnes is shockingly informed.
[1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:08.500]  Because let me tell you, I research so much stuff.
[1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:10.500]  Most people don't know the stuff I know.
[1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:12.500]  And I've really tested Barnes out on like three-hour dinners
[1:06:12.500 --> 1:06:16.500]  and stuff, throwing very esoteric historical stuff at him
[1:06:16.500 --> 1:06:18.500]  from all over the world, and he knows most of it.
[1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:21.500]  It's freakish.
[1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:26.500]  So that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen, tonight,
[1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:29.500]  6 p.m. Central.
[1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:31.500]  And I threw 6 p.m. Central out.
[1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:34.500]  I'm going to cover some news, cover the Middle East,
[1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:36.500]  cover some other reports for about 30 minutes,
[1:06:36.500 --> 1:06:38.500]  and then the real debate will start at about 6.30.
[1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:40.500]  Because I got a bunch of complaints.
[1:06:40.500 --> 1:06:42.500]  People are like, hey, Alex, you know,
[1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:44.500]  a lot of us don't get home mountain time,
[1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:45.500]  Pacific time, then.
[1:06:45.500 --> 1:06:46.500]  Don't worry.
[1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:49.500]  He'll all be archived free of charge at Band-Aught Video
[1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:56.500]  in the Nick Fuentes page and also over at the greatdebate.news.
[1:06:56.500 --> 1:06:58.500]  Takes you right to the subpage of Band-Aught Video.
[1:06:58.500 --> 1:07:00.500]  Barnes has a channel, but I'm not mad at him.
[1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:01.500]  He's a great guy.
[1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:03.500]  He's not been updating his channel,
[1:07:03.500 --> 1:07:05.500]  so maybe I'll add it to his channel as well.
[1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:07.500]  Barnes has been a little too busy for that.
[1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:09.500]  But again, that's all at Band-Aught Video.
[1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:11.500]  We like having Nick Fuentes.
[1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:13.500]  He's been updating his page three, four times a day.
[1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:16.500]  Millions of views at Band-Aught Video on the Nick Fuentes page
[1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:18.500]  just since he put it up there a week and a half ago.
[1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:22.500]  And Nick is very, very pleased by the response he's getting.
[1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:25.500]  And obviously all the folks tuning into his show,
[1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:27.500]  that's weeknights, and not on my network.
[1:07:27.500 --> 1:07:28.500]  I don't care.
[1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:30.500]  As long as the show's informative, we support it.
[1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:33.500]  I don't agree with Nick Fuentes on everything either, by the way.
[1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:35.500]  But see, we're not in a cult.
[1:07:35.500 --> 1:07:38.500]  It's like, I was disagreeing with Mike Adams about some things a year ago.
[1:07:38.500 --> 1:07:40.500]  He was right about some of it. I was right about some of it.
[1:07:40.500 --> 1:07:42.500]  I like Mike. He's a smart guy.
[1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:45.500]  We can disagree about 10% of stuff or 20%.
[1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:48.500]  See, we're not Democrats. We're not cultists here.
[1:07:48.500 --> 1:07:52.500]  We want to have debates, and it's a good thing to have those debates.
[1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:55.500]  I don't think Fuentes is anti-Israel.
[1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:58.500]  I think he's America first when Pat Buchanan, and it's pissed off.
[1:07:58.500 --> 1:08:01.500]  Sometimes in Israel gets preferential treatment over Americans.
[1:08:01.500 --> 1:08:03.500]  I am as well.
[1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:05.500]  But here's the deal.
[1:08:05.500 --> 1:08:08.500]  Israel's getting better treatment than Americans by our government.
[1:08:08.500 --> 1:08:12.500]  Compared to China, I'm going to talk about that some tonight
[1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:14.500]  for people that have criticism of Israel,
[1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:16.500]  which I think is legitimate in many cases,
[1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:18.500]  because it's not the Israeli people. It's the government.
[1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:20.500]  And these governments are basically all the same.
[1:08:20.500 --> 1:08:22.500]  Look at what Netanyahu has been up to with this.
[1:08:22.500 --> 1:08:25.500]  Let's microchip the kids and freedom bracelets to track you
[1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:27.500]  and try to have forced inoculations.
[1:08:27.500 --> 1:08:30.500]  And he's had clowns out telling kids to take shots.
[1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:34.500]  If you're taking a clowns, let's get to that right now.
[1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:36.500]  Let's get the number out.
[1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:40.500]  I want to get your take on ice cream trucks driving around Canada.
[1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:42.500]  And this is the same model all over the world.
[1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:45.500]  Whenever you see one of these countries that's coming to your town,
[1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:49.500]  in the U.K., it's like, we'll give you 100 pounds free on a government card
[1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:51.500]  when you take the shot.
[1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:54.500]  Or we'll give kids free ice cream and free movies.
[1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:57.500]  Or you'll be able to go to the restaurants again and live.
[1:08:57.500 --> 1:08:59.500]  What do you make of that?
[1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:01.500]  I want your take on these articles.
[1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:05.500]  OSHA pulls guidance stating employers may be held liable
[1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:08.500]  for adverse reactions if they mandate the vaccine.
[1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:13.500]  The liability protection of the 1986 Vaccine Damage Act
[1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:16.500]  doesn't extend to businesses that push that on you.
[1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:19.500]  And this is even a vaccine. It's a drug.
[1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:21.500]  So it's not going to be protected.
[1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:24.500]  So you're being stampeded into this to where there'll be so many people
[1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:26.500]  that committed the crime of doing this,
[1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:29.500]  they'll try to pass a liability law for you as well.
[1:09:29.500 --> 1:09:31.500]  But that's not been done yet, dumbasses.
[1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:33.500]  So a lot of these businesses out there,
[1:09:33.500 --> 1:09:36.500]  those businesses that are into this are dumbasses about the federal listeners,
[1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:39.500]  they're going to figure out real quick when their employees get sick or die
[1:09:39.500 --> 1:09:41.500]  that they're in deep trouble.
[1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:44.500]  They're doing this because they think, oh, I'm proving my business is safe.
[1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:47.500]  I've got liability protection because I may or might take a shot.
[1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:49.500]  The shot doesn't protect you.
[1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:51.500]  Before they turned the PCR test down to 28,
[1:09:51.500 --> 1:09:55.500]  most of the new positives in people in the hospital had taken the damn vaccine.
[1:09:55.500 --> 1:09:58.500]  They're getting COVID from it or something like it.
[1:09:58.500 --> 1:10:02.500]  That's just what the Nobel Prize winner warned of a year ago, now confirmed.
[1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:06.500]  Don't listen to the Nobel Prize winner, though, on virology.
[1:10:06.500 --> 1:10:09.500]  Listen to the fact checkers at CNN.
[1:10:09.500 --> 1:10:14.500]  They say everyone loves it and it's totally safe and it's approved when it's not.
[1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:16.500]  So OSHA is pulling that.
[1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:18.500]  Wow.
[1:10:18.500 --> 1:10:22.500]  Not saying it's not true, just pulling the advisory.
[1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:26.500]  You can find the advisory at infowars.com and share it with folks.
[1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:28.500]  This gaslighting there and launching isn't working.
[1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:32.500]  By the way, they announced a month ago that they had 40% of the public vaccinated.
[1:10:32.500 --> 1:10:36.500]  I went and dug up the actual numbers and told you it's more like 30%.
[1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:38.500]  Now, CNN today has the headline.
[1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:42.500]  They're fast approaching the goal of 50%.
[1:10:42.500 --> 1:10:44.500]  They haven't gotten anywhere near it, folks.
[1:10:44.500 --> 1:10:46.500]  Almost none of the medical workers are taking it.
[1:10:46.500 --> 1:10:50.500]  They've testified in Congress that only half at the CDC have an NIH.
[1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:54.500]  And believe me, most of those folks are lying about it.
[1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:58.500]  I've talked to hundreds of doctors on and off air.
[1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:01.500]  You've heard many of me here.
[1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:03.500]  And none of them, I know we're taking it.
[1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:05.500]  None of them, none of them.
[1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:11.500]  I ran into, again, the owner of a major genetic engineering company, a billionaire.
[1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:14.500]  And he told me all about how deadly it is.
[1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:16.500]  Six months ago, said don't ever take it.
[1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:21.500]  And then his lawyers found out he talked to me, because that's where I ran into him, was at a law firm,
[1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:25.500]  freaked out and called me and said, do not say his name, but you can say what he told you.
[1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:28.500]  I said, yeah, no kidding.
[1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:30.500]  But why is he so scared to tell you?
[1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:33.500]  He said, it's a power grab by Fauci and Gates.
[1:11:33.500 --> 1:11:34.500]  I told you that here.
[1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:36.500]  But we don't need him to tell us that.
[1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:38.500]  Yeah, I'm digressing.
[1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:47.500]  Toll free number 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:57.500]  And we will come back with the actual footage of, this is a joke on screen right now.
[1:11:57.500 --> 1:12:03.500]  We're going to come back with the actual vans and the actual free ice cream and the actual garbage.
[1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:06.500]  And while you're at it, find Netanyahu and the clown for the kids as well.
[1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:08.500]  I'm not kidding about this.
[1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:13.500]  Trying to push experimental shots, even though the parents are on video saying, don't do it, the police hold them back.
[1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:17.500]  Because they just show up with ice cream trucks at the park and start doing this.
[1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:19.500]  I mean, this is how pedophiles grab kids.
[1:12:19.500 --> 1:12:23.500]  This is the state coming in to say, we're forming a relationship with your child.
[1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:25.500]  You don't have jurisdiction over them.
[1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:28.500]  We do with an experimental illegal system.
[1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:30.500]  Canada is still under martial law.
[1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:31.500]  This is insane.
[1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:34.500]  Charges are being shut down all over the world.
[1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:37.500]  They're still being shut down in places like California and Michigan.
[1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:41.500]  While Whitmer's out with dozens of people eating dinner, not wearing a damn mask.
[1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:44.500]  Because she's a witch and knows it's all a fraud.
[1:12:44.500 --> 1:12:46.500]  By the way, our new big sale just launched.
[1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:47.500]  It's biggest since Christmas.
[1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:48.500]  Store-wide and free shipping.
[1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:49.500]  Double patriot points.
[1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:50.500]  DNA Force Plus.
[1:12:50.500 --> 1:12:54.500]  Back in stock in FullWarStore.com.
[1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:58.500]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold out
[1:12:58.500 --> 1:13:01.500]  for three months, four months, six months, seven months.
[1:13:01.500 --> 1:13:03.500]  It's not a gimmick to make you buy the products.
[1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:05.500]  I'm really genuinely freaked out.
[1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:08.500]  Because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements and books and films
[1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:10.500]  and t-shirts to fund the operation.
[1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:11.500]  Because they're great products.
[1:13:11.500 --> 1:13:12.500]  We're coming back and getting more.
[1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:14.500]  And thank you for the support.
[1:13:14.500 --> 1:13:17.500]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus, or whether it's a pollen block,
[1:13:17.500 --> 1:13:21.500]  or whether it's Supermobility or VasoBeats,
[1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:24.500]  because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world,
[1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:26.500]  we're not going to lower the quality of our products,
[1:13:26.500 --> 1:13:28.500]  and so we just can't offer them.
[1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:32.500]  But thank God it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now
[1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:36.500]  because suddenly a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:38.500]  And one of them is pollen block.
[1:13:38.500 --> 1:13:40.500]  It takes a long time to get into pollen block,
[1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:42.500]  but it's for seasonal discomforts.
[1:13:42.500 --> 1:13:43.500]  It's like allergies.
[1:13:43.500 --> 1:13:44.500]  It's from France.
[1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:46.500]  It's a special proprietary system.
[1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:50.500]  This is the highest quality back in stock in FullWarStore.com.
[1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:53.500]  Store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points.
[1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:54.500]  Check it out.
[1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:59.500]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where in Full Wars is.
[1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:02.500]  And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you
[1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:05.500]  because you are the patrons that make all this possible.
[1:14:05.500 --> 1:14:09.500]  So in short, the world's awakening, the spiral of censorship,
[1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:12.500]  in Full Wars has never been more influential
[1:14:12.500 --> 1:14:16.500]  and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:21.500]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down
[1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:24.500]  because most of the best-selling products which you want to buy,
[1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:27.500]  like DNA Force Plus and others, have been sold out for up to seven months.
[1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:28.500]  Well, guess what?
[1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:32.500]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months.
[1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:33.500]  It's 40% off.
[1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:35.500]  It's amazing at FullWarStore.com.
[1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:37.500]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day,
[1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:40.500]  we have store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points.
[1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:42.500]  And Alfa Power is back in stock.
[1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:44.500]  And Super Bowl Vitality is back in stock.
[1:14:44.500 --> 1:14:48.500]  And Pollen Block and Vazo Beach, they're all back in stock as much as 50% off.

[1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:54.500]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, Info Warriors.
[1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:57.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:10.500]  Woe to you, O Earth and sea,
[1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:14.500]  for the devil sends the beast with wrath,
[1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:18.500]  because he knows the time is short.
[1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:23.500]  Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast,
[1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:25.500]  for it is a human number.
[1:15:25.500 --> 1:15:30.500]  Its number is 666.
[1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:49.500]  Welcome back, my friends, to your TV viewer and on the radio listener.
[1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:57.500]  Maybe asking, why do I have a box of fruit loops on my desk?
[1:15:57.500 --> 1:16:02.500]  And why do I have a bag that formerly held green string peas
[1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:05.500]  that I ate last night to my wife made?
[1:16:05.500 --> 1:16:07.500]  How do these tie together?
[1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:10.500]  I'll tell you coming up here in just a moment.
[1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:16.500]  How does that tie into ice cream trucks and clowns from Israel to Canada,
[1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:19.500]  from Germany to the U.K. to Mexico,
[1:16:19.500 --> 1:16:25.500]  to get the kids to take their COVID secret Franken shot?
[1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:27.500]  Well, it all ties into this.
[1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:28.500]  Fox News.
[1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:32.500]  Divorce court judge orders COVID-19 vaccine for Liberty County man
[1:16:32.500 --> 1:16:35.500]  to see his children.
[1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:38.500]  The forced inoculations here.
[1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:42.500]  Decided to divide Chicago Health Department under Lightfoot Orders,
[1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:46.500]  restaurants and other companies that are under their control
[1:16:46.500 --> 1:16:49.500]  to segregate the vaccine from the unvaxxed
[1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:52.500]  and to check the medical records of it.
[1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:54.500]  Same system happening in the U.K.
[1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:56.500]  and the health minister coming out and saying,
[1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:58.500]  you're crazy if you don't accept the health passport
[1:16:58.500 --> 1:17:02.500]  after saying it didn't exist until last year.
[1:17:02.500 --> 1:17:04.500]  That's their psychological warfare.
[1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:10.500]  And LeBron James is in trouble for saying he's not taking it and not promoting it.
[1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:15.500]  That's right, the team he plays for says he was also caught out at a party
[1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:17.500]  promoting a tequila he owns.
[1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:19.500]  Not wearing a mask.
[1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:22.500]  Slave.
[1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:24.500]  I'm going to care if you're black or white or polka-dotted.
[1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:26.500]  This is all slavery.
[1:17:26.500 --> 1:17:27.500]  And it's all based on a lie.
[1:17:27.500 --> 1:17:29.500]  And so, you know, LeBron James is a selfish person,
[1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:32.500]  but sometimes as Andrew Ann said, selfishness is good.
[1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:34.500]  Like, hey, I want to own a gun to protect myself and family
[1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:37.500]  or hey, I'm selfish, LeBron James.
[1:17:37.500 --> 1:17:40.500]  I won't speak up against communist China because that will cut it on my money.
[1:17:40.500 --> 1:17:43.500]  But if you want me to take some deadly shot, they won't even take.
[1:17:43.500 --> 1:17:44.500]  I'm not doing it.
[1:17:44.500 --> 1:17:47.500]  Never forget, India and China won't take any of our vaccines.
[1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:49.500]  They know what's going on.
[1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:52.500]  That's for us to take.
[1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:56.500]  But I've been mentioning it, so here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:17:56.500 --> 1:17:59.500]  Here's just some of the parents and others saying,
[1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:04.500]  hey, you're at a local park with an ice cream truck
[1:18:04.500 --> 1:18:07.500]  and another facility handing out ice cream.
[1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:08.500]  And this is creepy.
[1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:11.500]  They need criminal consent in the police with their mask on.
[1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:12.500]  Hold them back.
[1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:14.500]  Here it is.
[1:18:14.500 --> 1:18:15.500]  We are mothers.
[1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:16.500]  Now, we are pissed off.
[1:18:16.500 --> 1:18:17.500]  We are not moving.
[1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:19.500]  This is our baby.
[1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:21.500]  You are f***ing with our baby.
[1:18:21.500 --> 1:18:22.500]  We are mothers.
[1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:24.500]  We are fathers.
[1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.500]  The strength of parents that have taken over us.
[1:18:26.500 --> 1:18:28.500]  And we are not moving.
[1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:32.500]  Until you guys find the truth of what is going on over there.
[1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:34.500]  Just in.
[1:18:34.500 --> 1:18:35.500]  We are pissed.
[1:18:35.500 --> 1:18:36.500]  We are at our edge.
[1:18:36.500 --> 1:18:38.500]  We have been respectful with you.
[1:18:38.500 --> 1:18:40.500]  We have been patient with you.
[1:18:40.500 --> 1:18:42.500]  We have tried to guide you to the f***ing way.
[1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:45.500]  But now we are messing with our f***ing children.
[1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:47.500]  And that is not okay.
[1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:49.500]  You want to arrest all of us?
[1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:50.500]  Arrest all of us.
[1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:53.500]  You want to be at the top of the f***ing ground.
[1:18:53.500 --> 1:18:55.500]  This is our children.
[1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:57.500]  And we will not back down.
[1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:59.500]  We will not back down.
[1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:00.500]  You don't scare me.
[1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:01.500]  You don't intimidate me.
[1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:03.500]  I have the strength of four children.
[1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:05.500]  These are police under leftist control.
[1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:06.500]  This is Toronto.
[1:19:06.500 --> 1:19:07.500]  You don't scare me.
[1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:08.500]  Police are bad in North Korea.
[1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:09.500]  They are bad in China.
[1:19:09.500 --> 1:19:10.500]  And you want to scare me.
[1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:12.500]  They are bad in Guatemala.
[1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:14.500]  And they are bad.
[1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:16.500]  In any leftist controlled area.
[1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:18.500]  I have strength of children inside my soul.
[1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:19.500]  The left don't.
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:20.500]  When you run to the police.
[1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:22.500]  They don't control all of them.
[1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:23.500]  What they do.
[1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:24.500]  They are coming for you.
[1:19:24.500 --> 1:19:25.500]  Not doing this.
[1:19:25.500 --> 1:19:26.500]  Coming for your church.
[1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:27.500]  Coming for your body.
[1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:28.500]  Wrong.
[1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:29.500]  Coming for your life.
[1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.500]  Wrong generation.
[1:19:31.500 --> 1:19:32.500]  My children.
[1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:33.500]  My children.
[1:19:33.500 --> 1:19:34.500]  By the way.
[1:19:34.500 --> 1:19:35.500]  They beg the police like they have any power.
[1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:36.500]  They are slaves of the government.
[1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:37.500]  They follow orders.
[1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:40.500]  Whether or not you have the capacity to understand this.
[1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:42.500]  Your children.
[1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:43.500]  Enough.
[1:19:43.500 --> 1:19:45.500]  Tricking children.
[1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:47.500]  They have the park blocked off.
[1:19:47.500 --> 1:19:49.500]  There is footage of the ice cream and ice cream trucks.
[1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:50.500]  You can see the local newscaster.
[1:19:50.500 --> 1:19:51.500]  There is a whole stack of them.
[1:19:51.500 --> 1:19:54.500]  CIBC joins City of Toronto to bring ice cream trucks to
[1:19:54.500 --> 1:19:56.500]  vaccine clinic.

[1:20:25.500 --> 1:20:26.500]  It'söm.
[1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:32.260]  docks detailing new effort to secretly censor vaccines concerns on a global scale project

[1:20:47.860 --> 1:20:53.460]  so we're going to block them i had to do something one of the facebook insider said we're trying to
[1:20:53.460 --> 1:20:59.540]  control content before it even makes it onto your page before you even see it they're they're
[1:20:59.540 --> 1:21:05.860]  reviewing it all they're getting to see what you don't get to see which is why they're racing to

[1:21:10.100 --> 1:21:14.020]  because we had at google insider's link as much documents like four years ago this is all starting
[1:21:14.020 --> 1:21:18.100]  to accelerate and he said listen do you know when they listen to your show and my show and the others

[1:21:55.380 --> 1:22:00.420]  uh which is oxymoron uh or as redundant as they would say a double entendre but but here's part
[1:22:00.420 --> 1:22:05.380]  of local newscast just normalizing oh a judge just says you got to take a vaccine totally
[1:22:05.380 --> 1:22:13.060]  illegal total power grab here it is new advice 30 a liberty county man says his rights were

[1:22:18.580 --> 1:22:27.220]  to see his kids fox 26 reporter ivory hacker has that story he pretty much told me and her both

[1:27:29.300 --> 1:27:30.780]  Tuesday edition.

[1:27:36.220 --> 1:27:42.180]  right after the war room ends at band.video, and remember, you can't share the link band.video

[1:27:56.940 --> 1:27:57.940]  One from memory.
[1:27:57.940 --> 1:27:58.940]  There's so many URLs.
[1:27:58.940 --> 1:27:59.940]  I can't remember them all.
[1:27:59.940 --> 1:28:03.540]  We'll put the great debate slate up there if we can.
[1:28:03.540 --> 1:28:08.620]  But that is tonight, ladies and gentlemen, 6 p.m. central, and of course, we'll have
[1:28:08.620 --> 1:28:16.740]  it playing on the front page of infowars.com and newswars.com.

[1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:24.180]  before they ban it.
[1:28:24.180 --> 1:28:25.180]  Great debate.news.
[1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:26.180]  6 p.m. central.
[1:28:26.180 --> 1:28:30.900]  Okay, we're going to go to your phone calls for 15 minutes for the next hour.
[1:28:30.900 --> 1:28:36.380]  Let me have one of the top Jiu Jitsu fighters in the world, Craig Jones, in studio who
[1:28:36.380 --> 1:28:41.100]  got really, really sick when he took the so-called COVID vaccine for the last 45 minutes of
[1:28:41.100 --> 1:28:42.100]  the next hour.
[1:28:42.100 --> 1:28:43.100]  Look forward to that.
[1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:48.100]  This is a very sad thing I'm about to talk about, but if you understand it, you can defeat
[1:28:48.100 --> 1:28:49.100]  it.
[1:28:49.100 --> 1:28:55.100]  And I really think it's important to try to find some humor in the nightmare depopulation
[1:28:55.100 --> 1:28:59.180]  operation that is taking place.
[1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:03.940]  If you read the Tabascock Institute documents going back 60 years, if you read the documents
[1:29:03.940 --> 1:29:10.100]  going back 90 years by Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, there was a plan to end the family
[1:29:10.100 --> 1:29:15.540]  as we know it under transhumanism and to end normal reproduction.
[1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:20.620]  And now they're telling you by the year 2045 or 2047 in major studies that there will be
[1:29:20.620 --> 1:29:22.420]  no sperm in any men on earth.
[1:29:22.420 --> 1:29:27.420]  Sperm have already declined by 50% and are now accelerating the decline again in the
[1:29:27.420 --> 1:29:31.980]  next 30 years until there are no sperm period.
[1:29:31.980 --> 1:29:36.460]  They're now saying, oh, test tube humans will make artificial humans.
[1:29:36.460 --> 1:29:44.540]  Well, it's simply the phthalates is the main thing that is put in plastics, the hardening
[1:29:44.540 --> 1:29:50.300]  compound that when you heat plastic to over 100 degrees on average, it begins to release
[1:29:50.300 --> 1:29:52.100]  the phthalates.
[1:29:52.100 --> 1:29:54.740]  That's why hard plastic gets soft when you microwave it.
[1:29:54.740 --> 1:29:57.420]  And then it off gasses phthalates into your food.
[1:29:57.420 --> 1:30:03.420]  It gives women breast cancer and makes men feminine and in utero it causes the male fetus
[1:30:03.420 --> 1:30:08.780]  to resemble more of a female fetus also in neurological development and that's in major
[1:30:08.780 --> 1:30:09.780]  studies.
[1:30:09.780 --> 1:30:14.780]  Phthalates during the first trimester will cause micro penis or smaller genitals and lower
[1:30:14.780 --> 1:30:18.860]  testosterone throughout life and a change in the development of the brain where you're
[1:30:18.860 --> 1:30:24.260]  not really a male or female, you're mainly like a sexless gray clone.
[1:30:24.260 --> 1:30:27.460]  And that's all scientific facts, just all admitted it's not debatable.
[1:30:27.460 --> 1:30:32.540]  So what does all this have to do with the two things on my desk if you are a radio
[1:30:32.540 --> 1:30:33.540]  listener?
[1:30:33.540 --> 1:30:34.540]  Let me describe them.
[1:30:34.540 --> 1:30:45.580]  I have right here the new Kellogg's Together with Pride heart shaped cereal and it's all
[1:30:45.580 --> 1:30:46.740]  rainbow pride.
[1:30:46.740 --> 1:30:52.820]  It says he, him, she, her, they, them, add your own of what you are because you're going
[1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:56.620]  to become genetically modified soon anyways and there won't be any real humans born anymore
[1:30:56.620 --> 1:30:59.060]  soon anyways so we have to get used to the transhumanism.
[1:30:59.060 --> 1:31:03.060]  You'll accept a man being a woman and competing in women's sports or a man going in a girl's
[1:31:03.060 --> 1:31:08.780]  bathroom or a pap smear on the cervix of a man's penis, you'll accept living in a total
[1:31:08.780 --> 1:31:12.700]  Jim Jones cult on PCP.
[1:31:12.700 --> 1:31:17.140]  And so this is not about love and being nice to everyone and accepting, it's about forcing
[1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:22.260]  a lifestyle the globalists want so you die alone just like the Facebook document showed
[1:31:22.260 --> 1:31:27.060]  totally without any friends isolated and dominated by them and on the top of the box it says
[1:31:27.060 --> 1:31:33.860]  to the children, you know, open yourself up a drag queen story time, my pronouns are
[1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:37.180]  lift here to open your heart.
[1:31:37.180 --> 1:31:41.300]  So they want to talk to your child about their sexual preference and about sex even though
[1:31:41.300 --> 1:31:43.180]  you're not doing it when they're five years old.
[1:31:43.180 --> 1:31:46.900]  So they ask about this so that now they're learning about being something different like
[1:31:46.900 --> 1:31:51.660]  it's a superhero totally predatory like ice cream trucks without parental consent giving
[1:31:51.660 --> 1:31:54.860]  people deadly experimental shots that violate the Nuremberg code.
[1:31:54.860 --> 1:32:03.020]  And of course inside the toxic, you know, red dye GMO crap sugar, a little fryer child's
[1:32:03.020 --> 1:32:11.860]  pancreas and brain as a chemical weapon, they also have the phthalate laden package so that
[1:32:11.860 --> 1:32:17.780]  you've got lots of that leaching into there as well and a printer ink has the sterile
[1:32:17.780 --> 1:32:22.260]  consent they have easy formulas, by the way, not to do this to you.
[1:32:22.260 --> 1:32:26.740]  Like I told you 20 years ago, the lining of juice boxes makes boys more feminine and
[1:32:26.740 --> 1:32:29.060]  girls go to puberty earlier.
[1:32:29.060 --> 1:32:33.380]  All of it very unhealthy increases cancer rates, but hey, got to break a few eggs to
[1:32:33.380 --> 1:32:34.980]  create the population.
[1:32:34.980 --> 1:32:42.700]  And so what does all of this have to do with this?
[1:32:42.700 --> 1:32:46.820]  Everything's in packaging now and I was literally telling my wife yesterday, I said, listen,
[1:32:46.820 --> 1:32:50.580]  you got to go to the store and just get stuff in paper bags or bring our own bags, you got
[1:32:50.580 --> 1:32:51.580]  to get raw stuff.
[1:32:51.580 --> 1:32:55.300]  We want potato chips, we got to get a potato and slice it and then fry it with natural
[1:32:55.300 --> 1:32:56.500]  oil or whatever.
[1:32:56.500 --> 1:33:04.100]  But we can't get stuff in bags and I already know this and everybody already knows this,
[1:33:04.100 --> 1:33:07.740]  we really got it and I get home and she's cooking dinner and I'm not mad at her because
[1:33:07.740 --> 1:33:10.180]  I forget to it and I go, why is there, what's in the microwave?
[1:33:10.180 --> 1:33:14.540]  She goes, oh, the green beans come in a microwavable deal, it's quicker than boiling and I said
[1:33:14.540 --> 1:33:18.180]  you hear what I was telling you, they're targeting with you this.
[1:33:18.180 --> 1:33:20.180]  The corporations know what they're doing.
[1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:25.700]  I'm not picking out this company, this is what she was doing, look, organic 365 trimmed
[1:33:25.700 --> 1:33:37.020]  green beans that says right here, ready in microwave in bag, cooks in five to six minutes.
[1:33:37.020 --> 1:33:38.020]  She said, well, I'll throw them away.
[1:33:38.020 --> 1:33:39.540]  I said, no, it's the aggregate buildup.
[1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:43.460]  It's like smoking a cigarette, one in your gig, I said, let's enjoy it.
[1:33:43.460 --> 1:33:45.700]  Let's sit there and feed it to our daughter and know we're hitting her with a chemical
[1:33:45.700 --> 1:33:46.700]  weapon.
[1:33:46.700 --> 1:33:49.700]  Let's talk about each bean we eat and we became, we ate the poison together but now we're
[1:33:49.700 --> 1:33:51.700]  not going to do it anymore.
[1:33:51.700 --> 1:34:00.620]  Okay, there it is, oh, it's organic, oh, non-GMO on the back but it's in a phthalate-ridden
[1:34:00.620 --> 1:34:08.620]  bag so your son grows a penis the size of a woman's clitoris.
[1:34:08.620 --> 1:34:12.740]  I mean, that's what all this is and I mean, this is real science, this isn't me being
[1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:18.220]  a shop-jop here so as your boys grow up really being sexless, they want to go, oh, no, you're
[1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:23.860]  really a girl and it changes their neurological development just like with the frogs but people
[1:34:23.860 --> 1:34:29.300]  notice this, Dave Rubin and others notice this, notice that it's got the gigum snack
[1:34:29.300 --> 1:34:35.980]  frog, now the gay frog, instead of fruit loops, it's hearts and now of course the frog, even
[1:34:35.980 --> 1:34:41.540]  the official spokes frog, is now gay so I guess everything I say one way or another
[1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:46.540]  ends up turning true but I was reading a study that the frogs then, male frogs preferred male
[1:34:46.540 --> 1:34:53.540]  frogs and stopped having children which is the Skittles new packaging is gray and white
[1:34:53.540 --> 1:35:00.380]  little Skittles and saying without the rainbow there is nothing and Levi's has got rainbow
[1:35:00.380 --> 1:35:04.820]  and it's just all the same stuff and I thought, no, that's better, that's a boneyard of no
[1:35:04.820 --> 1:35:09.140]  humans on earth because everyone's sterilized, they're really telling you what they're doing
[1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:12.780]  to you right there, aren't they? So here's some of the great Twitter comments that were
[1:35:12.780 --> 1:35:19.980]  made, Alex Jones haters posting their lives online, America's officially unfixable, Dave
[1:35:19.980 --> 1:35:25.940]  Rubin, a friend sent me this, I had known the idea on Tony the Tiger and two gone Sam were
[1:35:25.940 --> 1:35:32.060]  dating, well so's the frog, it's an orgy, here is Dave Rubin went to Target and even
[1:35:32.060 --> 1:35:40.300]  the Levi's shirt says they, them, she, her, he, em, we, was introducing you all this,
[1:35:40.300 --> 1:35:48.420]  friend sent me this, it goes on, Alex Jones was right, there's the gay frog and it just
[1:35:48.420 --> 1:35:52.500]  goes on from there, it's on the shelves in Pennsylvania as well, they are jumping the
[1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:56.140]  shark, no they're not, they're just beginning, they're chemical weaponing everybody and of
[1:35:56.140 --> 1:36:02.820]  course here is the boneyard skittles after the rainbow kills everybody, there's a little
[1:36:02.820 --> 1:36:09.300]  black kid asked why are they all white, they're all dead, it's their bones, that's right,
[1:36:09.300 --> 1:36:15.380]  so they're all gray, I guess if everybody's special, no one is, I know it's funny and
[1:36:15.380 --> 1:36:19.740]  ridiculous but for the love of God even putting this nonsense on serial boxes, school, TV
[1:36:19.740 --> 1:36:23.140]  movies, internet and now the serial, they are coming at kids with this from literally
[1:36:23.140 --> 1:36:29.380]  every angle, yes the big mega corporations, the big banks, the communist, Chinese funded
[1:36:29.380 --> 1:36:36.940]  news, all of them ladies and gentlemen, all of them and that's how they're throwing it
[1:36:36.940 --> 1:36:43.180]  in your face, that's the establishment agenda, hitting everyone as hard as they can, this
[1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:47.740]  is the post human sterilization plan and now they're going to tell you you're evil and
[1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:51.100]  racist if you don't guzzle phallates and now they're telling people they've got to remove
[1:36:51.100 --> 1:36:56.940]  their genitals, it's a genetic attack, one of the most common questions I get on air
[1:36:56.940 --> 1:37:02.860]  but also off air when I'm just out and about is Alex, what do I say to my family about
[1:37:02.860 --> 1:37:08.220]  the vaccines, how do I warn them, well the problem is there's so many problems with it,
[1:37:08.220 --> 1:37:12.060]  so many facts, it's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability
[1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:16.780]  protection in the US and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants
[1:37:16.780 --> 1:37:21.980]  and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines and the whole history of secret experimentation
[1:37:21.980 --> 1:37:26.580]  on at risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans, the list goes on and on
[1:37:26.580 --> 1:37:32.620]  but what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC
[1:37:32.620 --> 1:37:40.020]  in late May of 2021 that around half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, virologist
[1:37:40.020 --> 1:37:43.860]  scientists have refused to take the vaccine until they can say, yeah I think what half
[1:37:43.860 --> 1:37:47.900]  of the doctors are scared to take it, that's the same thing in the private practices out
[1:37:47.900 --> 1:37:51.500]  there, somewhere numbers, that's not something I'm going to be taking, that's very, very
[1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:53.940]  simple, there's your answer.
[1:37:53.940 --> 1:37:58.140]  You know, I'm cutting an ad right now and I've been here on the Saturday cutting these,
[1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:03.420]  I'm doing a terrible job because I just cut like five ads and I didn't tell people the
[1:38:03.420 --> 1:38:09.860]  most important part, no, it's not that DNA Force Plus has been sold out for seven months
[1:38:09.860 --> 1:38:14.380]  and is back in stock and is 40% off, or how the supply chain broke down and how it almost
[1:38:14.380 --> 1:38:19.220]  bankrupted us but thank God it finally came in, or how it cleans up your mitochondria
[1:38:19.220 --> 1:38:23.340]  and makes your telomeres last longer and can regrow nerves, you've got to go research
[1:38:23.340 --> 1:38:28.060]  DNA Force Plus, no, it's not that, I just cut all those ads, I forgot the most important
[1:38:28.060 --> 1:38:33.380]  point, the super-well vitality is back in stock, 50% off, the prostate is back 40% off,
[1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:38.860]  the alpha power is back 50% off, that ultra-12, vitamin B-12, take it out of the tongue, it's
[1:38:38.860 --> 1:38:45.220]  double, it's back, also 50% off, or vasovics, back 50% off, no, it's dead, we've got double
[1:38:45.220 --> 1:38:49.860]  patriot points and free shipping store-wide, double patriot points, free shipping store-wide
[1:38:49.860 --> 1:38:55.340]  on top of the huge sales.
[1:38:55.340 --> 1:38:59.860]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners this broadcast and I've got
[1:38:59.860 --> 1:39:04.180]  some really, really, really, really, really good news, yes, I can spend an hour telling
[1:39:04.180 --> 1:39:08.380]  you about how the globals are getting exposed and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio-weapon
[1:39:08.380 --> 1:39:12.020]  and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in, I can even tell you about how the
[1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:16.340]  states are turning against the public president Biden and saying we're going to have $1,000
[1:39:16.340 --> 1:39:20.220]  fines to try to make people wear masks, I can tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't
[1:39:20.220 --> 1:39:24.540]  I instead tell you about the super-good news concerning the M4 war?
[1:39:24.540 --> 1:39:28.860]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day Special
[1:39:28.860 --> 1:39:35.980]  for the next week only with store-wide free shipping, double patriot points and DNA Force
[1:39:35.980 --> 1:39:43.180]  Plus is back in stock, sold out for 7 months, 40% off, super-mobile mentality, 50% off,
[1:39:43.180 --> 1:39:50.460]  prostigard 40% off, album power 50%, ultra-12% 50% free shipping and patriot points and it
[1:39:50.460 --> 1:39:55.620]  comes in four, and it's incredible products and George Soros hates it, haha!
[1:39:55.620 --> 1:40:01.180]  Bio-remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[1:40:01.180 --> 1:40:05.620]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[1:40:05.620 --> 1:40:07.620]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[1:40:07.620 --> 1:40:12.700]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio-remediation
[1:40:12.700 --> 1:40:14.700]  products to the everyday consumer.
[1:40:14.700 --> 1:40:19.820]  Their first product they are launching is called Bio-Septic Pro, a product specifically designed
[1:40:19.820 --> 1:40:22.380]  to establish a healthy septic system.
[1:40:22.380 --> 1:40:26.740]  Bio-Septic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[1:40:26.740 --> 1:40:31.140]  This stuff lives in your septic system, it's really like probiotics for your septic tank
[1:40:31.140 --> 1:40:36.620]  and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary
[1:40:36.620 --> 1:40:38.500]  patented delivery system.
[1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:42.940]  Bio-Septic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[1:40:42.940 --> 1:40:46.980]  Visit thebio-pros.com today and protect your septic system.
[1:40:46.980 --> 1:40:48.980]  That's thebio-pros.com.
[1:40:48.980 --> 1:40:58.460]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled, thebio-pros.com.
[1:40:58.460 --> 1:41:09.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:09.300 --> 1:41:26.500]  The only way this evil plan succeeds is if good men and women do nothing.
[1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:32.060]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday transmission when we write your calls.
[1:41:32.060 --> 1:41:42.060]  We just joined us, I just laid out Levi's and all the major cereal makers, Kellogg's
[1:41:42.060 --> 1:41:56.180]  everywhere, they are just bombarding the public with massive, massive, massive agenda of sexualization
[1:41:56.180 --> 1:41:57.180]  of our children.
[1:41:57.180 --> 1:42:01.660]  At the end of the day, that's what this is all about, whether it's heterosexual or homosexual,
[1:42:01.660 --> 1:42:03.060]  it's wrong.
[1:42:03.060 --> 1:42:08.020]  Children need their innocence not to be bombarded with, tell the tiger telling you that you're
[1:42:08.020 --> 1:42:13.500]  not a boy, you're a girl, and the gig of a smack frog having a boyfriend.
[1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:19.380]  This is pure, absolute evil and telling children open up your heart when you open the box with
[1:42:19.380 --> 1:42:20.860]  a new pro down.
[1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:24.860]  This is creepiness, priming your children with a brainwashing in school so they can confuse
[1:42:24.860 --> 1:42:32.740]  them and try to get them to sign off before their age of consent to not be molested but
[1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:35.920]  to have their genitals cut off or to be chemically castrated.
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:40.300]  This is beyond pure evil and it's all about the phthalates that are in the food that are
[1:42:40.300 --> 1:42:43.940]  causing the sperm count collapse.
[1:42:43.940 --> 1:42:46.700]  And now they want to make it fashionable that men are no longer masculine because of the
[1:42:46.700 --> 1:42:47.700]  phthalates.
[1:42:47.700 --> 1:42:52.380]  That's all the globals had to do was pick formulas for general standardization of plastics that
[1:42:52.380 --> 1:42:58.260]  had phthalates in it and you've seen as plastics became popular in the 50s the decline in sperm
[1:42:58.260 --> 1:43:07.860]  by over 50% testosterone more than 60% online to have no males by the year 2047.
[1:43:07.860 --> 1:43:12.340]  That is their depopulation plan and they make it stylish and cool and the people abused
[1:43:12.340 --> 1:43:16.860]  by it, the victims of it are taught to love what they have been turned into.
[1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:22.540]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls about the ice cream trucks rolling around the U.S. and
[1:43:22.540 --> 1:43:27.460]  Canada but in Canada giving children deadly inoculations that are not approved and are
[1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:30.220]  franken shots without parental consent.
[1:43:30.220 --> 1:43:31.220]  Incredible.
[1:43:31.220 --> 1:43:35.380]  John in Canada, what's it like living under the lockdown in Toronto?
[1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:38.100]  It's pretty insane Alex.
[1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:41.260]  I mean I've been banned from the grocery stores.
[1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:45.740]  I have people calling the police on me just for going down the street because I refuse
[1:43:45.740 --> 1:43:47.180]  to wear a mask.
[1:43:47.180 --> 1:43:52.700]  There are very few people who are not submitting right now to this rule of tyranny and it extends
[1:43:52.700 --> 1:43:56.740]  to everything just like you were talking with the children and the gender identities
[1:43:56.740 --> 1:43:57.740]  and everything.
[1:43:57.740 --> 1:44:03.420]  It's total and complete brainwashing and it's taking over our lives, it's taking over
[1:44:03.420 --> 1:44:08.500]  what we are as people which is we're supposed to have the right to do everything that we
[1:44:08.500 --> 1:44:13.980]  desire to do with ourselves and they're telling us we're objects, we're cattle, we're being
[1:44:13.980 --> 1:44:18.300]  forced into a corner and I see so many people submitting.
[1:44:18.300 --> 1:44:22.300]  The vaccinations, I know the rates aren't as high as they want right now.
[1:44:22.300 --> 1:44:27.340]  I was talking to city councillors, they were having a meeting and they are just total propaganda
[1:44:27.340 --> 1:44:28.340]  war.
[1:44:28.340 --> 1:44:29.900]  They're up there lying about everything.
[1:44:29.900 --> 1:44:35.180]  They're telling people that if they don't get vaccines, you know, we're all doomed.
[1:44:35.180 --> 1:44:39.300]  And again it's not even a vaccine and for those that don't know this is all you and
[1:44:39.300 --> 1:44:45.700]  run and in Canada, in Australia and in places like Spain and the UK the lockdowns are never
[1:44:45.700 --> 1:44:46.700]  going to end.
[1:44:46.700 --> 1:44:50.180]  They're going to try to bring them back to places like Texas and other areas.
[1:44:50.180 --> 1:44:55.780]  That's why Fauci and Gates that launched all this have to go to prison and again targeting
[1:44:55.780 --> 1:45:00.780]  children without parental consent with an emergency authorized genetic engineering and injection.
[1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:05.300]  I mean this is Joseph Mingle stuff bro, this is Nazi Nuremberg stuff.
[1:45:05.300 --> 1:45:12.140]  No, absolutely, I mean they're treating this like we're some kind of experiments but I
[1:45:12.140 --> 1:45:16.860]  think that they've put program to kill switch into us because you know some evidence might
[1:45:16.860 --> 1:45:19.140]  show that we never got COVID here.
[1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:23.580]  Our Theresa Tam, our health czar said don't worry about this virus in February on your
[1:45:23.580 --> 1:45:24.580]  Twitter in 2020.
[1:45:24.580 --> 1:45:28.340]  She said don't worry about it, it can't spread easily, it doesn't spread.
[1:45:28.340 --> 1:45:32.940]  So and then I'm hearing doctors saying we're not finding it in any of the blood.
[1:45:32.940 --> 1:45:36.460]  So how is it that we are being vaccinated for something that isn't here?
[1:45:36.460 --> 1:45:41.260]  If they get re-exposed to this virus after taking this vaccine, there are antibodies
[1:45:41.260 --> 1:45:43.580]  that are going to overproduce and who knows what's going to happen.
[1:45:43.580 --> 1:45:47.500]  By the way, that's all admitted fact and now they're saying we don't care.
[1:45:47.500 --> 1:45:51.820]  If you've already had it, you've got to keep taking our shot even if it kills you and pregnant
[1:45:51.820 --> 1:45:52.820]  women need it too.
[1:45:52.820 --> 1:45:57.140]  It's just all about saying the president to kill us and have all the useful idiots
[1:45:57.140 --> 1:45:58.300]  go along with it.
[1:45:58.300 --> 1:45:59.300]  It is incredible.
[1:45:59.300 --> 1:46:00.820]  Thank you so much, John.
[1:46:00.820 --> 1:46:04.060]  And the scary part is about leftist is the more they're proving wrong, the more they
[1:46:04.060 --> 1:46:07.900]  get hurt, the more they double down.
[1:46:07.900 --> 1:46:08.900]  It's insane.
[1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:11.740]  They have like a delusional confidence.
[1:46:11.740 --> 1:46:15.780]  It's like that movie, I forget the name of it, I watched it last night about the fire
[1:46:15.780 --> 1:46:18.740]  festival that was staged in the Bahamas that was totally insane.
[1:46:18.740 --> 1:46:22.340]  They were all just insane leftists all conning each other and that's who they are.
[1:46:22.340 --> 1:46:24.620]  You watch that show, that's the left.
[1:46:24.620 --> 1:46:29.140]  Just weird virtues signaling like peacock weirdos that don't have any internal system
[1:46:29.140 --> 1:46:31.140]  or and feel totally empty.
[1:46:31.140 --> 1:46:35.500]  So they must absorb us to feel like they exist.
[1:46:35.500 --> 1:46:38.180]  Let's go ahead and talk to CD in Nevada.
[1:46:38.180 --> 1:46:39.180]  You're on the air.
[1:46:39.180 --> 1:46:40.180]  Welcome.
[1:46:40.180 --> 1:46:46.380]  Hey, Alan, some man, you know, I love you, man, and God bless us all.
[1:46:46.380 --> 1:46:49.420]  We are the strongest people in the world stage.
[1:46:49.420 --> 1:46:51.020]  We have the strongest guts.
[1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:52.020]  We have the strongest minds.
[1:46:52.020 --> 1:46:57.260]  We have the strongest body and they won't be being and we don't have time for them to
[1:46:57.260 --> 1:46:59.460]  give us flesh even poison.
[1:46:59.460 --> 1:47:05.620]  So when you said the ice cream truck, that ring of tune because why should a truck come
[1:47:05.620 --> 1:47:13.220]  through a neighborhood bringing music to bring people out and for them to get a shot?
[1:47:13.220 --> 1:47:15.180]  And it's literally the Pied Piper.
[1:47:15.180 --> 1:47:17.860]  It's out of a horror movie.
[1:47:17.860 --> 1:47:22.740]  I agree with you and the shot itself is poison, man.
[1:47:22.740 --> 1:47:23.740]  I hear you, CD.
[1:47:23.740 --> 1:47:24.740]  God bless you.
[1:47:24.740 --> 1:47:25.740]  We're going to move quick here.
[1:47:25.740 --> 1:47:27.740]  It's in New York.
[1:47:27.740 --> 1:47:28.740]  Thanks for calling.
[1:47:28.740 --> 1:47:29.740]  Yeah.
[1:47:29.740 --> 1:47:30.740]  CB is definitely on point.
[1:47:30.740 --> 1:47:31.740]  It is.
[1:47:31.740 --> 1:47:33.020]  It's straight out of a horror movie.
[1:47:33.020 --> 1:47:34.380]  It's very disturbing.
[1:47:34.380 --> 1:47:41.220]  And I do what I haven't noticed too many people saying is that they want to alter our genetics.
[1:47:41.220 --> 1:47:45.060]  Alex, like it's all about turning us away from God, turning our lifestyle away from
[1:47:45.060 --> 1:47:46.060]  God.
[1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:49.140]  And now we're at a point where we have to fight with these people just to conserve our
[1:47:49.140 --> 1:47:53.620]  very genetic code that God gave us that's been being passed down for thousands of years.
[1:47:53.620 --> 1:47:55.900]  I mean, these people are so sick and out of control.
[1:47:55.900 --> 1:48:00.540]  And let me tell you, Alex, if they actually are able to get rid of us, they're building
[1:48:00.540 --> 1:48:04.420]  their own little hell and they're changing their genetics so these demons will be able
[1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:06.100]  to interface with them.
[1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:09.180]  God's not going to recognize their bodies anymore and they're going to be stuck right
[1:48:09.180 --> 1:48:11.220]  here on this own hell that they're building.
[1:48:11.220 --> 1:48:12.220]  So I'll tell you this.
[1:48:12.220 --> 1:48:13.740]  I mean, they admit they're trying.
[1:48:13.740 --> 1:48:17.540]  Klaus Schwab says the takeover are genetics and that they're going to force this revolution
[1:48:17.540 --> 1:48:18.540]  on us.
[1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:22.340]  So this is a genetic engineering corporate takeover of our very bodies.
[1:48:22.340 --> 1:48:26.940]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex, and they do want us born in laboratories.
[1:48:26.940 --> 1:48:28.780]  I read their literature as well.
[1:48:28.780 --> 1:48:35.500]  If anybody wants to read the book, Read Genesis by George Church, it's probably 15 or 20 years
[1:48:35.500 --> 1:48:39.980]  old now, but he breaks down everything that they want to do to change our genetics coming
[1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:40.980]  into the future.
[1:48:40.980 --> 1:48:41.980]  God bless you, Alex.
[1:48:41.980 --> 1:48:42.980]  I love what you do.
[1:48:42.980 --> 1:48:43.980]  Absolutely.
[1:48:43.980 --> 1:48:44.980]  First they teach us that we're bad.
[1:48:44.980 --> 1:48:45.980]  We're evil.
[1:48:45.980 --> 1:48:46.980]  We're dirty.
[1:48:46.980 --> 1:48:50.140]  They're the global authority that decides what you can say about any medical issue.
[1:48:50.140 --> 1:48:55.420]  I mean, even governments try to criticize in big tech silences and a major Australian
[1:48:55.420 --> 1:48:57.580]  member of parliament criticized the vaccine.
[1:48:57.580 --> 1:48:59.340]  He was banned off Facebook.
[1:48:59.340 --> 1:49:01.340]  I mean, this is total control.
[1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:02.340]  This is it.
[1:49:02.340 --> 1:49:03.340]  This is their big move.
[1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:08.740]  This is them raping us with a GMO genetically engineered system that changes our very DNA.
[1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:10.180]  And it does, by the way.
[1:49:10.180 --> 1:49:11.180]  Thank you, Marcos.
[1:49:11.180 --> 1:49:15.020]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:49:15.020 --> 1:49:19.180]  Let's go ahead and talk to Truth Super in Canada.
[1:49:19.180 --> 1:49:20.180]  You're on the air.
[1:49:20.180 --> 1:49:21.180]  Welcome.
[1:49:21.180 --> 1:49:22.180]  Truth surfer, Alex.
[1:49:22.180 --> 1:49:23.180]  How you doing?
[1:49:23.180 --> 1:49:27.380]  Straight to the point, freeworldnews.tv, fantastic URL.
[1:49:27.380 --> 1:49:32.540]  That's how we hit these people, hit them with love, compassion and understanding.
[1:49:32.540 --> 1:49:41.300]  Next, to the ice cream trucks in Canada, total physiological, spiritual, mental warfare.
[1:49:41.300 --> 1:49:42.380]  This is World War III.
[1:49:42.380 --> 1:49:43.380]  You are not an alarmist.
[1:49:43.380 --> 1:49:44.380]  We all need to be alarmed.
[1:49:44.380 --> 1:49:49.460]  We need to be passionate, and we need to stop these people where they are at.
[1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:50.460]  Do not comply.
[1:49:50.460 --> 1:49:52.860]  Look at these animals with their masks on.
[1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:53.860]  They are animals.
[1:49:53.860 --> 1:49:56.660]  They are less than human.
[1:49:56.660 --> 1:49:59.500]  Ten months ago, emergency rooms were empty.
[1:49:59.500 --> 1:50:02.340]  Today, emergency rooms full.
[1:50:02.340 --> 1:50:04.260]  Look at the size of the police force.
[1:50:04.260 --> 1:50:09.300]  Ten years ago, the police force in Canada, the physical size of them, they were like
[1:50:09.300 --> 1:50:10.300]  normal people.
[1:50:10.300 --> 1:50:12.340]  Now, they're on steroids.
[1:50:12.340 --> 1:50:13.900]  This is an actual fact.
[1:50:13.900 --> 1:50:17.020]  When you go into the service, there's corruption there.
[1:50:17.020 --> 1:50:19.020]  They need to be tested for that.
[1:50:19.020 --> 1:50:20.020]  These people are on steroids.
[1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:23.500]  They have a chemical imbalance, and this is what's going down.
[1:50:23.500 --> 1:50:26.260]  That's where I'm at with that.
[1:50:26.260 --> 1:50:27.260]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:50:27.260 --> 1:50:28.760]  Truth surfer, thank you so much for calling.
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:30.260]  We're getting a lot of calls in here.
[1:50:30.260 --> 1:50:31.260]  We're going to go to break.
[1:50:31.260 --> 1:50:33.620]  I have a special guest who took the vaccine.
[1:50:33.620 --> 1:50:37.340]  He's one of the top issues folks in the world, a fellow Jones.
[1:50:37.340 --> 1:50:43.420]  He'll be on this in 15 minutes, but I'm going to come back and go to DJ, Dave, Dan, Corey,
[1:50:43.420 --> 1:50:49.060]  Scott, and Wilde before our guest comes in studio for 45 minutes, then Paul Joseph Watson
[1:50:49.060 --> 1:50:54.220]  takes over from the U.K. for an hour, and then the War Room at three hours, then I'm
[1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:59.580]  going to host the debate with Nick Fuentes and Robert Barnes on the mid-East crisis.
[1:50:59.580 --> 1:51:02.900]  That should be very informative, 6 p.m. today.
[1:51:02.900 --> 1:51:07.340]  Please do not forget we have the Memorial Day special, the biggest show we've had since
[1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:12.060]  Christmas, store-wide free shipping through Memorial Day, double-patriot points, meaning

[1:51:44.140 --> 1:51:48.860]  I don't really need to sell you on how beet concentrate is really good for your heart,
[1:51:48.860 --> 1:51:52.900]  good for your liver, good for your lungs, good for your cardiovascular system or your brain.
[1:51:52.900 --> 1:51:57.500]  It's well-known and so beet supplements are amongst the best sellers out there, so I went
[1:51:57.500 --> 1:52:01.420]  out to a top lab and I said, what is the strongest beet concentrate?
[1:52:01.420 --> 1:52:05.780]  You can do a copy of the popular formula you have, they explained that their formula had
[1:52:05.780 --> 1:52:09.700]  a certain percentage and I said, just like with Body's Ultimate Turmeric formula, with
[1:52:09.700 --> 1:52:14.460]  the average competitors at 5% or 6% or Humanoid, I said no one else does 95, that's the highest
[1:52:14.460 --> 1:52:19.660]  level, I said give me 95% or 6% Humanoid, didn't even cost much more, and we have 95%
[1:52:19.660 --> 1:52:20.660]  or 6% Humanoid.
[1:52:20.660 --> 1:52:25.540]  Well, it's the same thing here, this is a very strong beet extract, and it's very good
[1:52:25.540 --> 1:52:30.260]  for your body, good for your heart, and it's back in stock, VasoBeats at infowarstore.com,

[1:52:41.860 --> 1:52:45.700]  patriot points for the week of Memorial Day.

[1:52:51.620 --> 1:52:58.100]  We are kicking globalist ass up and down the planet right now, their entire agenda of depopulation,

[1:53:48.020 --> 1:53:59.380]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:59.380 --> 1:54:14.260]  All right, Craig Jones got really sick, he took the COVID vaccine, couldn't fight, but
[1:54:14.260 --> 1:54:19.820]  he's going to be doing a big bout this Friday at the Marriott here in downtown Austin, I'm
[1:54:19.820 --> 1:54:22.940]  told Joe Rogan's going to be there, I just got invited to it, I may actually go to that,
[1:54:22.940 --> 1:54:28.380]  but he's going to come up with about 10, 15 minutes in studio to talk about his experience
[1:54:28.380 --> 1:54:31.660]  and what happened to him, and again, I appreciate Joe Rogan telling me about this or I wouldn't
[1:54:31.660 --> 1:54:34.540]  have known about it because the media covers this stuff up.
[1:54:34.540 --> 1:54:39.420]  Let's go ahead and take more of your calls, let's go ahead and talk to, who's up next
[1:54:39.420 --> 1:54:40.420]  here?
[1:54:40.420 --> 1:54:46.740]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Texas, Scott in Texas and Wild in Wisconsin, you're
[1:54:46.740 --> 1:54:47.740]  on the air.
[1:54:47.740 --> 1:54:48.740]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:54:48.740 --> 1:54:54.740]  A couple weeks ago, you were getting a little down, seems like you're doing a lot better,
[1:54:54.740 --> 1:54:59.820]  but I wanted to just let you know that we're reinforcement on arriving, that the truth community
[1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:04.940]  is growing, getting stronger, getting bigger, quite amazing looking on the sidelines, watching
[1:55:04.940 --> 1:55:05.940]  it.
[1:55:05.940 --> 1:55:11.260]  A few months ago, I told you about the Grand Theft World podcast, well, come to find out
[1:55:11.260 --> 1:55:19.620]  that it has Richard Grove in it, and he was on your show a decade ago, and the work he's
[1:55:19.620 --> 1:55:23.020]  doing, it's just incredible.
[1:55:23.020 --> 1:55:26.740]  One doctor that he aired was Dr. Fleming.
[1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:32.180]  I think David Eyck was thoroughly enjoying what he's showing, proving there is a virus,
[1:55:32.180 --> 1:55:36.740]  so maybe you can reach out to him and tell him to look into this podcast as well.
[1:55:36.740 --> 1:55:42.380]  It's just amazing information that I think you all would both appreciate.
[1:55:42.380 --> 1:55:43.980]  I totally agree, brother.
[1:55:43.980 --> 1:55:48.420]  What else is your take on reinforcements arriving, because I am seeing a huge awakening
[1:55:48.420 --> 1:55:50.620]  out there.
[1:55:50.620 --> 1:55:51.620]  It's everywhere.
[1:55:51.620 --> 1:55:56.500]  Here in West Texas, there's like maybe 5% of the people here wear masks, like it's
[1:55:56.500 --> 1:56:00.740]  just, like you said, the great awakening, like I hear everyone talk about the great
[1:56:00.740 --> 1:56:01.980]  awakening.
[1:56:01.980 --> 1:56:02.980]  It's incredible to watch.
[1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:09.860]  I see your stickers all over the place, so I'll go into restaurants and stalls, and
[1:56:09.860 --> 1:56:11.820]  to see, ban that video written there.
[1:56:11.820 --> 1:56:16.740]  I write them there as well, but I'm not the only one around here doing that, so it's
[1:56:16.740 --> 1:56:17.740]  happening.
[1:56:17.740 --> 1:56:24.500]  You were one of the first initial ones to wake people up, like James Corbett or Richard
[1:56:24.500 --> 1:56:30.940]  Grove or, I mean, Derrick Bros, there's the greater reset happening this week, which that
[1:56:30.940 --> 1:56:31.940]  should be incredible.
[1:56:31.940 --> 1:56:32.940]  I don't know if you've heard of that.
[1:56:32.940 --> 1:56:33.940]  No, I haven't.
[1:56:33.940 --> 1:56:38.300]  Somebody should tell me about it, in fact, tell me about it.
[1:56:38.300 --> 1:56:43.180]  They have a, it's a whole week, I think, I believe it starts tonight.
[1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:44.820]  It goes until Friday or Saturday.
[1:56:44.820 --> 1:56:45.820]  They have Robert F.
[1:56:45.820 --> 1:56:54.140]  Kennedy Jr., Dr. Cahill, I believe Tim Penny is going to be in there, Derrick Bros, Brian
[1:56:54.140 --> 1:57:00.180]  Christensen from The Last Marriage of Bagoban, Richard Grove speaking, I believe Corbett's
[1:57:00.180 --> 1:57:01.180]  talking.
[1:57:01.180 --> 1:57:05.340]  It's everyone in the truth community that's, anyone that somebody is going to be there.
[1:57:05.340 --> 1:57:07.780]  Ricky Brando is like, everybody's going to be there.
[1:57:07.780 --> 1:57:08.780]  It's amazing.
[1:57:08.780 --> 1:57:09.780]  The good setup.
[1:57:09.780 --> 1:57:10.780]  All right, brother, beautiful.
[1:57:10.780 --> 1:57:11.780]  I'll have to look into that.
[1:57:11.780 --> 1:57:16.300]  I mean, I'll tell you, Kennedy Jr. is giving speeches like million people in Germany and
[1:57:16.300 --> 1:57:17.300]  stuff.
[1:57:17.300 --> 1:57:18.300]  The system's really scared.
[1:57:18.300 --> 1:57:19.300]  Thank you so much.
[1:57:19.300 --> 1:57:22.660]  Let's go ahead and take another call as we go to break here in about a minute and a half.
[1:57:22.660 --> 1:57:24.380]  Let's talk to Wilde in Wisconsin.
[1:57:24.380 --> 1:57:26.380]  Go ahead, Wilde.
[1:57:26.380 --> 1:57:28.540]  Hello, Mr. Chainbreaker.
[1:57:28.540 --> 1:57:34.140]  I was wondering why Trump acted the way he did with the coronavirus and back saga and
[1:57:34.140 --> 1:57:36.940]  wanted to bounce these theories off you.
[1:57:36.940 --> 1:57:39.740]  First, not a lot of people talk about that.
[1:57:39.740 --> 1:57:46.900]  Trump's grandpa, Frederick Trump, died from the 1918 Spanish flu, which made Donald Trump's
[1:57:46.900 --> 1:57:52.860]  dad, Fred Trump, take over the family business at 12 years old or 14.
[1:57:52.860 --> 1:57:57.300]  Therefore, Trump may have a predisposition of fear of the same.
[1:57:57.300 --> 1:57:58.860]  Well, I mean, that's a fact.
[1:57:58.860 --> 1:58:03.100]  Roger Stone's told me privately stuff, not a lot, but, and it's also public.
[1:58:03.100 --> 1:58:07.100]  Trump has been a major germaphobe, but he got over it in recent years.
[1:58:07.100 --> 1:58:08.100]  But yes.
[1:58:08.100 --> 1:58:09.100]  Okay.
[1:58:09.100 --> 1:58:15.260]  My other Wilder conspiracy theory that hasn't been discussed is the same thing that happened
[1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:21.420]  to Tito in Yugoslavia, where in a nutshell, Tito was replaced with a body double by Stalin
[1:58:21.420 --> 1:58:26.260]  in revenge for selling Russian rocket designs to JFK.
[1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:30.220]  I was wondering if the same thing happened to Trump when he could have been replaced
[1:58:30.220 --> 1:58:32.340]  when he went in for COVID treatment.
[1:58:32.340 --> 1:58:36.820]  If you could take a look at his thickness, size and change in that span, let alone his
[1:58:36.820 --> 1:58:39.900]  change in tone and rhetoric.
[1:58:39.900 --> 1:58:43.220]  Maybe he was just contaminated by the swamp or morphed into a polyp.
[1:58:43.220 --> 1:58:46.020]  I got to tell you, I've met Trump and I saw him again on the six.
[1:58:46.020 --> 1:58:47.020]  It's the same dude.
[1:58:47.020 --> 1:58:48.020]  There.
[1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:53.660]  All questions are good to ask for the right backstages.
[1:58:53.660 --> 1:58:58.380]  We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials.
[1:58:58.380 --> 1:59:00.820]  And right now we've got store-wide free shipping.
[1:59:00.820 --> 1:59:03.220]  We've got double Patriot points.

[1:59:17.340 --> 1:59:18.340]  Some of you haven't.
[1:59:18.340 --> 1:59:19.340]  You've got to go check these out.
[1:59:19.340 --> 1:59:24.260]  These are all top-of-the-line formulas, some of them clones of best-sellers, others original

[1:59:28.420 --> 1:59:29.420]  And it's all there.
[1:59:29.420 --> 1:59:34.500]  There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales
[1:59:34.500 --> 1:59:37.340]  and specials to mention them all here today.

[2:00:12.220 --> 2:00:19.220]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:19.220 --> 2:00:31.260]  To stay live, see globalists begin forced segregation of vax anti-vax in Chicago.
[2:00:31.260 --> 2:00:35.580]  They're announcing the same thing in Europe, and they want to check an app to make sure
[2:00:35.580 --> 2:00:37.860]  you've been injected before you can go in.
[2:00:37.860 --> 2:00:42.460]  And they say those that have been injected will get better seats at baseball games and
[2:00:42.460 --> 2:00:47.220]  football games and, I guess, the fights, but not if Dana White has his way.
[2:00:47.220 --> 2:00:52.860]  He says, 100% open, or he's not bringing his fights to your town.
[2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:58.580]  Speaking of fights to your town, Craig Jones, internationally ranked BJJ Black Belt on the
[2:00:58.580 --> 2:01:04.660]  top grapplers in the world, is going to be in studio with us.
[2:01:04.660 --> 2:01:07.540]  There's a big event coming up this Friday.
[2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:13.860]  I'll tell you about that in studio coming up here in just a moment, and I didn't know
[2:01:13.860 --> 2:01:14.860]  any problem was going to be in town.
[2:01:14.860 --> 2:01:15.860]  I think he's going to be in town.
[2:01:15.860 --> 2:01:17.660]  My good buddy, Eddie, I got to give him a call.
[2:01:17.660 --> 2:01:21.260]  I've been so lucky to know those guys forever, but I just got a chance to meet Mr. Jones.
[2:01:21.260 --> 2:01:24.900]  All right, let's go ahead and take more phone calls here.
[2:01:24.900 --> 2:01:28.180]  Who's been holding the longest?
[2:01:28.180 --> 2:01:31.460]  That would be DJ in New York.
[2:01:31.460 --> 2:01:33.140]  DJ, thanks for calling.
[2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:34.660]  What's your view on all this craziness?
[2:01:34.660 --> 2:01:43.100]  I'd really like to focus on my pitch on nanotechnology related to AI.
[2:01:43.100 --> 2:01:44.100]  I've called you before.
[2:01:44.100 --> 2:01:48.140]  I'm the guy whose uncle was dying from the Pfizer shot.
[2:01:48.140 --> 2:01:49.820]  I called you last week.
[2:01:49.820 --> 2:01:54.220]  I don't really want to focus too much on that right now.
[2:01:54.220 --> 2:02:01.260]  I really want to focus on nanotechnology from my own experience having more gallons and
[2:02:01.260 --> 2:02:05.300]  knowing that it's AI controlled because that's our real enemy.
[2:02:05.300 --> 2:02:10.300]  That's the thing that needs to be witnessed about in what we're dealing with because
[2:02:10.300 --> 2:02:17.740]  the nanotechnology is the mechanism through the 5G that they're able to control us and
[2:02:17.740 --> 2:02:22.980]  the AI controlled by demons is the way that they're going to bring us down.
[2:02:22.980 --> 2:02:26.980]  There are a couple of people that are very familiar with this that you need to have or
[2:02:26.980 --> 2:02:34.860]  you should have on your show, and one of them is a German scientist named Harold Koch-Vehler
[2:02:34.860 --> 2:02:40.500]  and that's H-A-R-A-L-C, his first name, not O.
[2:02:40.500 --> 2:02:48.820]  He, along with Celeste Solem, are two of those people to talk to about the effects of the
[2:02:48.820 --> 2:02:51.300]  nanotechnology and how it's controlled by demons.
[2:02:51.300 --> 2:02:52.300]  All right.
[2:02:52.300 --> 2:02:53.300]  I will.
[2:02:53.300 --> 2:02:54.300]  I'm going to a lot of calls.
[2:02:54.300 --> 2:02:55.300]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[2:02:55.300 --> 2:03:01.180]  Look, I know that it can grow prions in the brain, which are crystals, and I know they're
[2:03:01.180 --> 2:03:02.420]  pushing it and they know it hurts us.
[2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:07.460]  I don't know about them controlling our minds with things like that, though they say they
[2:03:07.460 --> 2:03:10.460]  want to put nanotech in our body that does control our brain.
[2:03:10.460 --> 2:03:12.140]  Klaus Schwab has said that.
[2:03:12.140 --> 2:03:15.420]  He says, next, he wants an implantable chip to prove you're vaccinated, but that's the
[2:03:15.420 --> 2:03:16.420]  next step.
[2:03:16.420 --> 2:03:20.580]  So, as crazy as it all sounds, they're definitely pushing it.
[2:03:20.580 --> 2:03:23.260]  There's one of the studies.
[2:03:23.260 --> 2:03:24.260]  Thank you, DJ.
[2:03:24.260 --> 2:03:27.620]  Okay, let's go ahead now and take another call.
[2:03:27.620 --> 2:03:29.660]  Let's talk to Corey in California.
[2:03:29.660 --> 2:03:30.660]  Go ahead, Corey.
[2:03:30.660 --> 2:03:31.660]  Hey there, Alex.
[2:03:31.660 --> 2:03:32.660]  Can you hear me?
[2:03:32.660 --> 2:03:33.660]  I sure can.
[2:03:33.660 --> 2:03:34.660]  Good phone.
[2:03:34.660 --> 2:03:35.660]  Go ahead.
[2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:36.660]  I'll be talking quick.
[2:03:36.660 --> 2:03:37.660]  I got a lot to say.
[2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:40.740]  First, I want to say that, Brother Alex, you led me to Jesus.
[2:03:40.740 --> 2:03:43.740]  Whether or not you'll accept my gratitude for this, I know that the Father is working
[2:03:43.740 --> 2:03:44.740]  through you.
[2:03:44.740 --> 2:03:45.740]  I do accept your gratitude, brother.
[2:03:45.740 --> 2:03:46.740]  I just appreciate you.
[2:03:46.740 --> 2:03:47.740]  Go ahead.
[2:03:47.740 --> 2:03:48.740]  All right.
[2:03:48.740 --> 2:03:53.220]  Firstly, I'd like to restate the skeleton key, which I came to understand through
[2:03:53.220 --> 2:03:54.460]  listening to inforworks.
[2:03:54.460 --> 2:03:58.820]  The trinity of a human being is of an eternal soul, which comes directly from the Creator
[2:03:58.820 --> 2:04:03.540]  of all that is who came here as Jesus Christ and we guide and direct us, and has endowed
[2:04:03.540 --> 2:04:07.540]  us with inalienable free will, this axiomatic understanding for which a good starting point
[2:04:07.540 --> 2:04:08.540]  for action.
[2:04:08.540 --> 2:04:13.380]  And also, on this ice cream truck obscenity, this is an example of something that only
[2:04:13.380 --> 2:04:18.260]  someone completely asleep or possessed would be unable to recognize as an abject even.
[2:04:18.260 --> 2:04:19.580]  I do want to mention something about-
[2:04:19.580 --> 2:04:23.300]  I mean, yeah, it's literally luring children to give them an experimental shot without parental
[2:04:23.300 --> 2:04:27.260]  consent, and the police are on the news saying, you don't need parental consent.
[2:04:27.260 --> 2:04:30.460]  I looked up the Canadian law, it's the same as ours, it's illegal.
[2:04:30.460 --> 2:04:34.460]  They're committing crime en masse to train us that they can do what they want.
[2:04:34.460 --> 2:04:35.460]  That's called the takeover.
[2:04:35.460 --> 2:04:40.660]  It's satanic, Alex, and what we have to remember is all the worldly power they have, the one
[2:04:40.660 --> 2:04:42.780]  thing they do not have is the Holy Spirit.
[2:04:42.780 --> 2:04:44.860]  They do not have Jesus Christ, they do not have the Creator.
[2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:45.860]  That's where we come from.
[2:04:45.860 --> 2:04:51.020]  And then I want to mention about sleep, sometimes when you're sleeping, it's very hard to wake
[2:04:51.020 --> 2:04:55.020]  up, and the deeper the sleep, the harder that awakening is, and there's a time for
[2:04:55.020 --> 2:04:59.180]  error worms, which frankly I think that we are at, and there is a time for kind, gentle
[2:04:59.180 --> 2:05:02.500]  guidance, and I ask them when dealing with the deeply asleep, we remember our common
[2:05:02.500 --> 2:05:03.500]  origin when acting.
[2:05:03.500 --> 2:05:04.500]  His origin is-
[2:05:04.500 --> 2:05:07.980]  Sir, I love you to death, but you're reading off a piece of paper, and I've got to get
[2:05:07.980 --> 2:05:09.500]  to a lot of calls here, okay?
[2:05:09.500 --> 2:05:15.780]  I opened the phones about the ice cream trucks, about Facebook specifically saying, we're
[2:05:15.780 --> 2:05:19.220]  going to suppress real damage from vaccines, we're going to cover up crimes.
[2:05:19.220 --> 2:05:22.620]  And I'm not mad, it's just that when I say open phones, that's whatever you want to talk
[2:05:22.620 --> 2:05:27.260]  about, but I really wanted to get in to the COVID push and the big takeover.
[2:05:27.260 --> 2:05:28.820]  Thank you for the call.
[2:05:28.820 --> 2:05:32.420]  I promise you to a lot of calls, we're going to get to them.
[2:05:32.420 --> 2:05:37.020]  Let's go to Dan in Canada on the ice cream trucks for kids, trying to lure them in for
[2:05:37.020 --> 2:05:38.260]  these dangerous shots.
[2:05:38.260 --> 2:05:39.260]  What's your view?
[2:05:39.260 --> 2:05:45.740]  Yeah, Alex, I don't even recognize my country anymore, man, up here, like honestly, like
[2:05:45.740 --> 2:05:52.700]  my wife and I, we grew up in a Canada that was free, you know, we enjoyed the people,
[2:05:52.700 --> 2:05:56.060]  we enjoyed nature, we enjoyed everything, we're trapped in our houses.
[2:05:56.060 --> 2:05:59.140]  Our kids are killing themselves on an unprecedented level.
[2:05:59.140 --> 2:06:02.060]  I'm mad as hell about it, and there's so many of us that are mad as hell about it, but we're
[2:06:02.060 --> 2:06:07.220]  in the minority up here, so I'm afraid nothing is going to change until people here really
[2:06:07.220 --> 2:06:11.740]  start waking up and letting their voices be heard, and that's why I'm glad I got to talk
[2:06:11.740 --> 2:06:12.740]  to you today.
[2:06:12.740 --> 2:06:16.820]  I've been here for the past 20 years up here, but I'm calling on our American brothers and
[2:06:16.820 --> 2:06:22.300]  our sisters down there to let people like Doug Ford and Christine Elliott and all the
[2:06:22.300 --> 2:06:27.260]  other politicians up here that are killing us more than helping us, let them know how
[2:06:27.260 --> 2:06:32.380]  you feel, let them know that you support us, and let them know that this has to end, because
[2:06:32.380 --> 2:06:36.420]  this is anti-human, and this is not right, and I see my kids with their heads down their
[2:06:36.420 --> 2:06:40.460]  beds on a sunny day, they're depressed, they don't want to go outside, I've had enough
[2:06:40.460 --> 2:06:43.180]  of it, and I'm not going to stand for it anymore.
[2:06:43.180 --> 2:06:46.380]  That's the thing, they program people to become shut-ins, especially children.
[2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:47.380]  This is extremely abusive.
[2:06:47.380 --> 2:06:51.900]  It was all written up by the big psychological warfare bureaus via the UN, whether you're
[2:06:51.900 --> 2:06:56.660]  in Australia or whether you're in Canada or whether you're in Europe or areas of the US.
[2:06:56.660 --> 2:07:01.980]  It's all standardized Milgram experiment to see what they can do based on the fraudulent
[2:07:01.980 --> 2:07:02.980]  PCR test.
[2:07:02.980 --> 2:07:07.100]  So in Germany, any time they want to lock somebody down, they just turn the PCR test
[2:07:07.100 --> 2:07:11.500]  up and say, this week we'll count it at 40 cycles, making everybody positive.
[2:07:11.500 --> 2:07:16.460]  Then if you've had the shot, they turn it down to 28, where no one's positive.
[2:07:16.460 --> 2:07:22.300]  It's all premeditated cult programming, we're inside the leftist cult, thanks for the call.
[2:07:22.300 --> 2:07:28.460]  And they didn't set this up with brainwashing universities and anti-God, anti-family, racial
[2:07:28.460 --> 2:07:31.500]  division for no reason, just to do that at universities.
[2:07:31.500 --> 2:07:36.780]  They're launching it out into every business, every facet of life to see if other people
[2:07:36.780 --> 2:07:41.940]  will comply with bringing in the AI, global cashless society, worldwide social credit
[2:07:41.940 --> 2:07:42.940]  score.
[2:07:42.940 --> 2:07:43.940]  It's here.
[2:07:43.940 --> 2:07:44.940]  This is it.
[2:07:44.940 --> 2:07:48.620]  And you see the places that were traditionally more free didn't do it because people didn't
[2:07:48.620 --> 2:07:50.500]  go along.
[2:07:50.500 --> 2:07:55.260]  Wherever people go along, it never ends because they want to post human world.
[2:07:55.260 --> 2:07:57.420]  China has now doubled and tripled its profits.
[2:07:57.420 --> 2:08:01.580]  The big banks have in the last year, the West is going bankrupt, Biden has announced they're
[2:08:01.580 --> 2:08:10.020]  not going to allow any mining of rare earth minerals in the U.S. with executive power.
[2:08:10.020 --> 2:08:13.540]  They're now announcing gas prices are going to have a new tax ban on it.
[2:08:13.540 --> 2:08:18.820]  It's designed to smother us and transfer our jobs to China.
[2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:22.700]  All right, we still got loaded phone lines here because there's other callers hanging
[2:08:22.700 --> 2:08:23.700]  up and we're calling in.
[2:08:23.700 --> 2:08:25.900]  I'm going to cram in one more before we go to break.
[2:08:25.900 --> 2:08:27.940]  Dave in Kansas, go ahead.
[2:08:27.940 --> 2:08:28.940]  Hi, Alex.
[2:08:28.940 --> 2:08:39.340]  Just a simple question, I guess, and it's why is the media pivoting 12 months ago, 12
[2:08:39.340 --> 2:08:42.660]  whatever it was, they said, oh, no, it was met.
[2:08:42.660 --> 2:08:46.460]  The virus never came from Wuhan before lab.
[2:08:46.460 --> 2:08:53.100]  So what is your end game and finally admitting that it will, I'm going to have the crew remind
[2:08:53.100 --> 2:08:57.580]  me to do the first five minutes the next hour only on this and remind me, guys, I'm going
[2:08:57.580 --> 2:09:00.780]  to do it because I only have a minute until we got to break with such a big question.
[2:09:00.780 --> 2:09:05.820]  But that's a very complex question because it was already coming out because they can't
[2:09:05.820 --> 2:09:09.260]  stop the truth coming out because so many scientists looked at the virus and said it
[2:09:09.260 --> 2:09:10.860]  was manmade.
[2:09:10.860 --> 2:09:15.300]  And because China made a deal with the globalist to launch this, to only get rid of Trump.
[2:09:15.300 --> 2:09:20.380]  Now China and the left are trying to get the West permanently closed to have China totally
[2:09:20.380 --> 2:09:21.380]  dominate now.
[2:09:21.380 --> 2:09:25.940]  And the global balance of power, they want a bipolar world, not a unipolar world.
[2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:28.780]  And so they don't want Europe and the U.S. completely defeated yet.
[2:09:28.780 --> 2:09:35.060]  And so China and a certain faction of China files have over leveraged this and used it
[2:09:35.060 --> 2:09:39.220]  not to bring in the world government, but to bring in a planetary system run by the
[2:09:39.220 --> 2:09:40.220]  dragon.
[2:09:40.220 --> 2:09:43.420]  And so now this is reverse leverage back on them.
[2:09:43.420 --> 2:09:45.420]  Does that make sense?
[2:09:45.420 --> 2:09:47.420]  Sir, you know, I'd be.
[2:09:47.420 --> 2:09:48.420]  Hold on.
[2:09:48.420 --> 2:09:49.420]  Don't hang up.
[2:09:49.420 --> 2:09:50.420]  You're still there.
[2:09:50.420 --> 2:09:51.420]  Finding.
[2:09:51.420 --> 2:09:52.420]  Hold on.
[2:09:52.420 --> 2:09:53.420]  I got to go to break.
[2:09:53.420 --> 2:09:54.420]  These are hard program breaks.
[2:09:54.420 --> 2:09:58.140]  Our best selling products have been sold out for three months, four months, six months,
[2:09:58.140 --> 2:09:59.140]  seven months.
[2:09:59.140 --> 2:10:00.860]  It's not a gimmick to make you buy the products.
[2:10:00.860 --> 2:10:05.580]  I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements
[2:10:05.580 --> 2:10:09.380]  and books and films and key shirts to fund the operation because they're great products
[2:10:09.380 --> 2:10:12.220]  that we're coming back and getting more and say it for the sport.
[2:10:12.220 --> 2:10:16.540]  But whether it's DNA force plus or whether it's pollen block or whether it's super
[2:10:16.540 --> 2:10:22.260]  mobile vitality or vaso beats because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're
[2:10:22.260 --> 2:10:26.140]  not going to lower the quality of our products and so we just can't offer them.
[2:10:26.140 --> 2:10:31.220]  But thank God it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now because suddenly
[2:10:31.220 --> 2:10:34.180]  a lot of products have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[2:10:34.180 --> 2:10:39.140]  And one of them is pollen block takes a long time to get into pollen block, but it's for
[2:10:39.140 --> 2:10:41.620]  seasonal discomfort stuff like allergies.
[2:10:41.620 --> 2:10:42.620]  It's from France.
[2:10:42.620 --> 2:10:45.180]  It's a special proprietary system.
[2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:50.060]  This is the highest quality back in stock info or store.com store wide free shipping and
[2:10:50.060 --> 2:10:51.060]  double patriot points.
[2:10:51.060 --> 2:10:55.620]  Let's check it out.
[2:10:55.620 --> 2:11:01.740]  Your voice counts when you share information be it over the Internet or in person, it changes
[2:11:01.740 --> 2:11:02.740]  the world.
[2:11:02.740 --> 2:11:05.180]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:11:05.180 --> 2:11:06.700]  They know you're angry.
[2:11:06.700 --> 2:11:11.020]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:11:11.020 --> 2:11:12.020]  we've got.

[2:11:56.420 --> 2:12:17.900]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:17.900 --> 2:12:26.700]  All right, folks, we've got Craig Jones in studio and Joe Rogan is a big fan of his.
[2:12:26.700 --> 2:12:30.540]  I'm told Joe's going to be at one of his big matches at the Marriott Hotel in downtown
[2:12:30.540 --> 2:12:33.740]  Austin this Friday, and I guess I might try to go to that.
[2:12:33.740 --> 2:12:36.980]  I want to go, but I might end up having too much fun.
[2:12:36.980 --> 2:12:43.340]  Craig Jones is an Australian grappler and Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt under the Lackland
[2:12:43.340 --> 2:12:49.060]  Gills who competes for the Absolute MMA Academy in the Sports International Circuit.
[2:12:49.060 --> 2:12:50.540]  Did I butcher that or is that right?
[2:12:50.540 --> 2:12:51.540]  It's close.
[2:12:51.540 --> 2:12:55.900]  So, look, I used to be my coach and now I train in the US in Puerto Rico with John
[2:12:55.900 --> 2:12:56.900]  Dana.
[2:12:56.900 --> 2:12:57.900]  That's awesome.
[2:12:57.900 --> 2:13:01.500]  Jones would later submit his status as one of the best grapplers of the generation by
[2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:07.140]  winning numerous prestigious events, including multiple belt titles in the Polaris International
[2:13:07.140 --> 2:13:12.540]  Promotion and Craig Jones, BJJ on Instagram, so it's good to have you here.
[2:13:12.540 --> 2:13:13.540]  Good to be here, man.
[2:13:13.540 --> 2:13:14.940]  Yeah, I mean, Joe's a big fan of yours.
[2:13:14.940 --> 2:13:18.020]  He's like, man, this guy's one of the best guys in the world, look, he got all sick on
[2:13:18.020 --> 2:13:19.020]  the damn vaccine.
[2:13:19.020 --> 2:13:22.820]  Yeah, yeah, it was pretty rough for a couple of weeks there, so I go to the vaccines just
[2:13:22.820 --> 2:13:27.780]  because obviously my family's in Australia, parents, brother, and stuff, so I assumed
[2:13:27.780 --> 2:13:31.460]  I would need it to travel and I was like, oh yeah, well, start just tell people what's
[2:13:31.460 --> 2:13:34.500]  happened in Australia what that's been like, one of the most locked down places ever.
[2:13:34.500 --> 2:13:36.860]  I mean, they're going back to the old prison colony for a while.
[2:13:36.860 --> 2:13:37.860]  Yeah, that's for sure.
[2:13:37.860 --> 2:13:42.740]  So, I mean, if I were to go back now, I'll be locked in hotel quarantine for full 14
[2:13:42.740 --> 2:13:43.740]  days.
[2:13:43.740 --> 2:13:44.740]  Yeah, there's no way around it.
[2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:48.540]  You have to pay for the quarantine yourself, so yeah, pretty brutal.
[2:13:48.540 --> 2:13:51.660]  And then so you decided which, which, which injection did you get?
[2:13:51.660 --> 2:13:53.740]  So I went with the Pfizer injection.
[2:13:53.740 --> 2:13:57.620]  I was in Vegas and I just had those mass injection facilities, so I went in there to get it done
[2:13:57.620 --> 2:14:02.900]  and then probably 48 hours later, it sort of went south for me.
[2:14:02.900 --> 2:14:03.900]  What did it feel like?
[2:14:03.900 --> 2:14:09.500]  Um, so obviously fever and stuff, they said that was normal, but then my armpits swelled
[2:14:09.500 --> 2:14:13.620]  up and then obviously you saw the, the video, I had this like fluid retention in my stomach
[2:14:13.620 --> 2:14:17.860]  and that was for three, four days at least felt like I was, I was pregnant.
[2:14:17.860 --> 2:14:20.100]  Yeah, guys, roll that video from his Instagram if you can.
[2:14:20.100 --> 2:14:21.100]  I'll just, just over.
[2:14:21.100 --> 2:14:22.100]  Yeah.
[2:14:22.100 --> 2:14:23.100]  There it is.
[2:14:23.100 --> 2:14:24.100]  Yeah.
[2:14:24.100 --> 2:14:25.100]  Yeah.
[2:14:25.100 --> 2:14:26.100]  So that was, it was pretty concerning.
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:27.100]  I mean, I saw a medic about it.
[2:14:27.100 --> 2:14:29.100]  He didn't seem too concerned with it, but yeah, very, very uncomfortable.
[2:14:29.100 --> 2:14:33.500]  I actually was meant to compete in Austin and I had to pull out because of this.
[2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:36.740]  So I got the COVID vaccine and maybe I missed out on the grappling match, which we're going
[2:14:36.740 --> 2:14:40.380]  to try and read books.
[2:14:40.380 --> 2:14:44.820]  Have you heard about how the Pfizer shot and others are causing women to grow tumors?
[2:14:44.820 --> 2:14:45.820]  I haven't.
[2:14:45.820 --> 2:14:50.180]  No, that's pretty serious, but also men are getting basic cancer from it.
[2:14:50.180 --> 2:14:52.180]  But they're saying, Oh, don't worry about this type of cancer.
[2:14:52.180 --> 2:14:53.180]  Everything's okay.
[2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:54.180]  I'm not joking.
[2:14:54.180 --> 2:14:55.180]  Oh, I regret it now.
[2:14:55.180 --> 2:15:00.500]  Well, you, I mean, you're probably going to be all right, but did you take one shot
[2:15:00.500 --> 2:15:01.500]  or two shots?
[2:15:01.500 --> 2:15:02.500]  Only the first.
[2:15:02.500 --> 2:15:05.500]  And there were a lot of people telling me that the second shot is typically worse.
[2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:06.500]  Oh, yeah.
[2:15:06.500 --> 2:15:08.180]  The first shot scared me out again that second one.
[2:15:08.180 --> 2:15:10.740]  So I guess I got it for no reason because I still won't be able to travel after just
[2:15:10.740 --> 2:15:11.740]  one shot.
[2:15:11.740 --> 2:15:12.740]  Well, here's the thing.
[2:15:12.740 --> 2:15:13.740]  They're, they're, it's color of law.
[2:15:13.740 --> 2:15:14.740]  They're lying to you.
[2:15:14.740 --> 2:15:17.220]  If you have a PCR test, they have to let you fly.
[2:15:17.220 --> 2:15:21.420]  They're supposed to turn the PCR test down to 28 at 40 and most of them are false positive.
[2:15:21.420 --> 2:15:23.300]  So it's all a robot scam.
[2:15:23.300 --> 2:15:25.420]  That's why it's good that you're here and explain this to people because we can use
[2:15:25.420 --> 2:15:26.980]  you as a teaching example.
[2:15:26.980 --> 2:15:29.540]  They're trying to get everybody on board for mandatory vaccines.
[2:15:29.540 --> 2:15:33.180]  And if you've ever had COVID, you shouldn't take the vaccine because it can kill you.
[2:15:33.180 --> 2:15:34.180]  They admit all that.
[2:15:34.180 --> 2:15:37.540]  So the idea that everybody can even take a regular vaccine is a lie.
[2:15:37.540 --> 2:15:39.060]  I had COVID as well.
[2:15:39.060 --> 2:15:41.740]  And I told him I had COVID and they just still, still gave me the vaccine.
[2:15:41.740 --> 2:15:43.540]  Oh, that's why you got sick from the first shot.
[2:15:43.540 --> 2:15:44.540]  Probably.
[2:15:44.540 --> 2:15:45.540]  Yes.
[2:15:45.540 --> 2:15:46.540]  Yeah.
[2:15:46.540 --> 2:15:47.540]  Yeah.
[2:15:47.540 --> 2:15:48.540]  I think, I think that must be a joke message.
[2:15:48.540 --> 2:15:49.540]  Me actually Joe was like, yeah, man, if you've had COVID, definitely don't get the
[2:15:49.540 --> 2:15:50.540]  vaccine.
[2:15:50.540 --> 2:15:51.540]  Wow.
[2:15:51.540 --> 2:15:52.540]  Yeah.
[2:15:52.540 --> 2:15:53.980]  I tell you, Joe knows quite a bit about this.
[2:15:53.980 --> 2:15:57.700]  He says on there, oh, I'm just a talk show host, but you know, don't listen to me.
[2:15:57.700 --> 2:15:59.740]  But yeah, I don't think young hell people should take the shot.
[2:15:59.740 --> 2:16:01.620]  Well, that's what scientists are saying.
[2:16:01.620 --> 2:16:02.620]  Yeah.
[2:16:02.620 --> 2:16:05.100]  I mean, for me, it was just basically I wanted to travel.
[2:16:05.100 --> 2:16:08.580]  But if you're saying, yeah, PCR test, I'm just hoping when I go back to Australia, eventually
[2:16:08.580 --> 2:16:10.940]  that'll lock me up for two weeks in the quarantine.
[2:16:10.940 --> 2:16:16.620]  Well, all you got to do is in the future have a doctor say, you already had COVID, you had
[2:16:16.620 --> 2:16:20.420]  a violent response to the shot, you should not take any more COVID vaccines.
[2:16:20.420 --> 2:16:21.420]  And then that's on them.
[2:16:21.420 --> 2:16:24.420]  Look at the establishments not taking any shots.
[2:16:24.420 --> 2:16:25.940]  They're all getting on private jets.
[2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:26.940]  Yeah.
[2:16:26.940 --> 2:16:27.940]  Oh, yeah.
[2:16:27.940 --> 2:16:28.940]  That would be good.
[2:16:28.940 --> 2:16:29.940]  If I could do that.
[2:16:29.940 --> 2:16:34.460]  Well, but you see what they're doing, they're setting the precedent to put experimental
[2:16:34.460 --> 2:16:36.940]  shots in our bodies that violates the Nuremberg code.
[2:16:36.940 --> 2:16:37.940]  Oh, really?
[2:16:37.940 --> 2:16:38.940]  Yeah.
[2:16:38.940 --> 2:16:42.660]  But listen, a lot of people are going to end up watching this or they're into MMA.
[2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:47.060]  And I just want to try to inform them about their rights because they're lying to everybody.
[2:16:47.060 --> 2:16:49.940]  Even in communist China, the vaccines are not mandatory.
[2:16:49.940 --> 2:16:50.940]  Really?
[2:16:50.940 --> 2:16:51.940]  No.
[2:16:51.940 --> 2:16:56.100]  I think Australia is definitely going to be mandatory, unfortunately, but that's because
[2:16:56.100 --> 2:16:58.700]  they think the public will put up with it.
[2:16:58.700 --> 2:16:59.700]  Yeah.
[2:16:59.700 --> 2:17:04.100]  I mean, imagine, what about the folks that are dying when they take it?
[2:17:04.100 --> 2:17:06.100]  I haven't heard about that.
[2:17:06.100 --> 2:17:07.100]  Is that pretty common?
[2:17:07.100 --> 2:17:10.460]  Oh, a lot of folks have died, but then they say, well, we're not doing an autopsy and we're
[2:17:10.460 --> 2:17:11.460]  not sure that killed them.
[2:17:11.460 --> 2:17:13.660]  But yeah, they take it and have a heart attack about a day later and die.
[2:17:13.660 --> 2:17:16.740]  Is that a lot of people that have already had COVID as well?
[2:17:16.740 --> 2:17:19.340]  They don't know because they don't, they don't test to see if you've had it.
[2:17:19.340 --> 2:17:23.580]  But yes, if you've already had COVID and you take it, the discoverer of HIV, he was a top
[2:17:23.580 --> 2:17:27.180]  neurologist, Nobel Prize winner, he says that will cause you to have a basically a heart
[2:17:27.180 --> 2:17:28.180]  attack and die.
[2:17:28.180 --> 2:17:30.180]  It causes the heart to swell up.
[2:17:30.180 --> 2:17:31.180]  Oh, shit.
[2:17:31.180 --> 2:17:32.180]  Absolutely.
[2:17:32.180 --> 2:17:34.500]  I wish I knew this before.
[2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:36.220]  We can show you how much these people would have died.
[2:17:36.220 --> 2:17:39.580]  That lady's organs liquefied after she took it.
[2:17:39.580 --> 2:17:40.580]  Liquefied.
[2:17:40.580 --> 2:17:41.580]  30-something years old.
[2:17:41.580 --> 2:17:43.580]  Oh, we should.
[2:17:43.580 --> 2:17:44.580]  Yeah.
[2:17:44.580 --> 2:17:45.580]  You know, it's good to have you here, Craig.
[2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:49.580]  Tell us about the fight that's coming up this Friday.
[2:17:49.580 --> 2:17:50.580]  This Friday.
[2:17:50.580 --> 2:17:51.580]  Yeah.
[2:17:51.580 --> 2:17:55.580]  My teammate, Gordon Ryan, is considered the best scrapper in the world.
[2:17:55.580 --> 2:17:59.580]  He's having some stomach issues, not related to COVID or anything, like some gastroparesis.
[2:17:59.580 --> 2:18:03.580]  He actually might have to retire young because of it, but he pulled out of this event.
[2:18:03.580 --> 2:18:04.580]  So I'm jumping in.
[2:18:04.580 --> 2:18:08.580]  Again, I wanted to jump in because I ruined the last event by getting the COVID vaccine,
[2:18:08.580 --> 2:18:09.580]  having to pull out.
[2:18:09.580 --> 2:18:12.580]  So I'm going up against a guy called Louise Panzer.
[2:18:12.580 --> 2:18:15.580]  We'll have it on Friday night at the Marriott.
[2:18:15.580 --> 2:18:16.580]  I'm hoping to see you there.
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:17.580]  I think Joe, Eddie's coming.
[2:18:17.580 --> 2:18:19.580]  Eddie's got a student competing.
[2:18:19.580 --> 2:18:21.580]  A few of my teammates are competing, too.
[2:18:21.580 --> 2:18:25.580]  I've got Damien, Ethan, and sorry, Damien, Nikki, and Tarza competing.
[2:18:25.580 --> 2:18:26.580]  But it should be a very cool show.
[2:18:26.580 --> 2:18:28.580]  You'll be able to see it on Flow Grappling.
[2:18:28.580 --> 2:18:30.580]  Again, tell folks where they can see it.
[2:18:30.580 --> 2:18:33.580]  Flow Grappling.com, like a subscription website.
[2:18:33.580 --> 2:18:35.580]  But yeah, it should be a very fun card.
[2:18:35.580 --> 2:18:38.580]  Well, so how did you get into grappling?
[2:18:38.580 --> 2:18:40.580]  I got into grappling probably.
[2:18:40.580 --> 2:18:41.580]  I can't even remember.
[2:18:41.580 --> 2:18:45.580]  Like, when I was a kid, my cousin used to teach jiu-jitsu, and it was just sort of something fun to do.
[2:18:45.580 --> 2:18:48.580]  But luckily, as a sport girl, I was able to turn into a career.
[2:18:48.580 --> 2:18:50.580]  Have you ever tried jiu-jitsu?
[2:18:50.580 --> 2:18:52.580]  No, I'm out of shape.
[2:18:52.580 --> 2:18:55.580]  I remember talking about, on Rogan, about you choking people out in high school.
[2:18:55.580 --> 2:18:58.580]  Well, that was us doing it to each other, just for fun.
[2:18:58.580 --> 2:19:00.580]  Where did you learn that?
[2:19:00.580 --> 2:19:02.580]  I forget just somebody was like, hey, have you done this?
[2:19:02.580 --> 2:19:04.580]  And we started doing it to each other.
[2:19:04.580 --> 2:19:05.580]  I think it was in junior high.
[2:19:05.580 --> 2:19:07.580]  How many times did you get choked down?
[2:19:07.580 --> 2:19:08.580]  A few.
[2:19:08.580 --> 2:19:12.580]  You'd have a really cool dream, like a hallucination real fast, and then, like, wake up.
[2:19:12.580 --> 2:19:17.580]  I've been choked out one time, and I remember I woke up the 10 seconds, didn't know who I was, where I was.
[2:19:17.580 --> 2:19:19.580]  Kind of a real strange experience.
[2:19:19.580 --> 2:19:21.580]  Yeah, it's kind of like getting kids don't try this at home.
[2:19:21.580 --> 2:19:23.580]  I probably shouldn't even have told that story.
[2:19:23.580 --> 2:19:25.580]  I was like, that's why you're so interesting, Alex.
[2:19:25.580 --> 2:19:31.580]  Yeah, I've been, I've been, I'm going to say knocked out, but I've been piled driving the C-MAT, too.
[2:19:31.580 --> 2:19:32.580]  Really?
[2:19:32.580 --> 2:19:33.580]  Yeah.
[2:19:33.580 --> 2:19:34.580]  When was that?
[2:19:34.580 --> 2:19:35.580]  I was about 15.
[2:19:35.580 --> 2:19:36.580]  Who did that to you?
[2:19:36.580 --> 2:19:40.580]  It was this guy's brother who started a fight with me before, and I, like, broke his nose.
[2:19:40.580 --> 2:19:45.580]  Then his older brother was like the state wrestling champion, his weight, and just grabbed me in a parking lot and slammed my head in the ground.
[2:19:45.580 --> 2:19:46.580]  Did it knock you out?
[2:19:46.580 --> 2:19:53.580]  Nope, I saw a lot of stars and stuff, and then I could see anything that was going to happen, so I jumped on top of him and crushed his, uh, larynx, and he had to get a trigonomy.
[2:19:53.580 --> 2:19:55.580]  I put him in a, I didn't know what to jail for that.
[2:19:55.580 --> 2:19:56.580]  They had let me out.
[2:19:56.580 --> 2:19:57.580]  Who had to jail for it?
[2:19:57.580 --> 2:19:58.580]  Yeah, because he was in the ambulance.
[2:19:58.580 --> 2:19:59.580]  I had to do a trigonomy on him.
[2:19:59.580 --> 2:20:02.580]  So you took out his, the younger brother and the older brother?
[2:20:02.580 --> 2:20:05.580]  No, the older brother or cousin, I jumped on top of him.
[2:20:05.580 --> 2:20:06.580]  Oh, shit.
[2:20:06.580 --> 2:20:07.580]  You must have a strong, uh, strong chin.
[2:20:07.580 --> 2:20:08.580]  Well, that was a long time.
[2:20:08.580 --> 2:20:09.580]  No, it was my head.
[2:20:09.580 --> 2:20:10.580]  The head, yeah.
[2:20:10.580 --> 2:20:12.580]  I got about 10 stitches on top of my head from it.
[2:20:12.580 --> 2:20:16.580]  But if you're the tough guy, he'll beat me up. That was a long time ago.
[2:20:16.580 --> 2:20:17.580]  I grew up in Dallas.
[2:20:17.580 --> 2:20:18.580]  Dallas is a lot of fighting in Dallas.
[2:20:18.580 --> 2:20:22.580]  Anyways, let's not, that's, I can't, I can't even walk across the hall right now, so.
[2:20:22.580 --> 2:20:24.580]  I'm like an old man here, 47.
[2:20:24.580 --> 2:20:25.580]  Nothing about me.
[2:20:25.580 --> 2:20:26.580]  In fact, that's a fiction story.
[2:20:26.580 --> 2:20:27.580]  It's not true, folks.
[2:20:27.580 --> 2:20:28.580]  None of it's true.
[2:20:28.580 --> 2:20:30.580]  Look, why would you have a defense?
[2:20:30.580 --> 2:20:31.580]  Oh, God.
[2:20:31.580 --> 2:20:34.580]  The guy was like, you, you, you, you said such my cousin or brother, whatever.
[2:20:34.580 --> 2:20:35.580]  I was like, what?
[2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:36.580]  I was like, bam, head in the ground.
[2:20:36.580 --> 2:20:37.580]  I can't believe it.
[2:20:37.580 --> 2:20:39.580]  And the guy was like standing there and I got up like bleeding.
[2:20:39.580 --> 2:20:41.580]  I was like, I can't believe it didn't knock.
[2:20:41.580 --> 2:20:44.580]  He stood there looking at it like it was, it didn't knock me out.
[2:20:44.580 --> 2:20:46.580]  I was like, I've been lucky.
[2:20:46.580 --> 2:20:48.580]  I don't think I've ever been knocked out.
[2:20:48.580 --> 2:20:50.580]  Anyways, that's about me.
[2:20:50.580 --> 2:20:52.580]  Let's talk about you when we come back.
[2:20:52.580 --> 2:20:58.580]  We know the global elites, the 1%, have hijacked and subverted the U.S. culture, economy and government.
[2:20:58.580 --> 2:21:03.580]  The battle to take back America begins with the Rise USA, the resurrection tour.

[2:22:52.580 --> 2:22:56.580]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and lusters this broadcast.
[2:22:56.580 --> 2:23:00.580]  And then I've got some really, really, really, really good news.
[2:23:00.580 --> 2:23:03.580]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about how the Globals are getting exposed
[2:23:03.580 --> 2:23:06.580]  and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon
[2:23:06.580 --> 2:23:08.580]  and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in.
[2:23:08.580 --> 2:23:12.580]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president Biden
[2:23:12.580 --> 2:23:15.580]  and saying we're going to have $1,000 fines to try to make people wear masks.
[2:23:15.580 --> 2:23:22.580]  I can tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the InfoWars.
[2:23:22.580 --> 2:23:28.580]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day special for the next week only.

[2:23:52.580 --> 2:23:55.580]  Gerald of South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[2:23:55.580 --> 2:23:56.580]  Hey, Alex.
[2:23:56.580 --> 2:23:57.580]  Welcome.
[2:23:57.580 --> 2:24:02.580]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:24:02.580 --> 2:24:05.580]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[2:24:05.580 --> 2:24:11.580]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[2:24:11.580 --> 2:24:17.580]  Living Defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:24:17.580 --> 2:24:19.580]  Living Defense brought me back.
[2:24:19.580 --> 2:24:24.580]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:24:24.580 --> 2:24:27.580]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[2:24:27.580 --> 2:24:36.580]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my namesake.
[2:24:36.580 --> 2:24:42.580]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:24:42.580 --> 2:24:44.580]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[2:24:44.580 --> 2:24:48.580]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say.
[2:24:48.580 --> 2:24:52.580]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:24:52.580 --> 2:25:04.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:25:04.580 --> 2:25:23.580]  Greg Jones is in studio with us. I'm Alex Jones, your host. We had a caller earlier that asked me why they pivoted on the Wuhan lab story.
[2:25:23.580 --> 2:25:27.580]  After denying that it could have been man-made or come from a lab, even though we know it did.
[2:25:27.580 --> 2:25:29.580]  We know that people in the lab got sick.
[2:25:29.580 --> 2:25:34.580]  We know that you can scan the virus and see it's man-made. Why are they pivoting now?
[2:25:34.580 --> 2:25:50.580]  And the answer is, I don't know. I've got a lot of ideas, but I just know that scientists and people I trust have been very accurate that I've known for 20 years, like Dr. Francis Boyle laid it all out in January of last year and on my show in February.
[2:25:50.580 --> 2:26:00.580]  And top institutes in Australia, in India, in France that have CRISPR gene editing systems read the virus and said it's five viruses combined.
[2:26:00.580 --> 2:26:06.580]  That's why when Australia had their own vaccine, people were getting HIV positive who took it, though they didn't actually have HIV.
[2:26:06.580 --> 2:26:10.580]  The virus has an HIV shell or delivery system.
[2:26:10.580 --> 2:26:19.580]  The spike protein is sent to get through the mucous membrane in the nose and infect people or through other mucous membranes with its delivery system.
[2:26:19.580 --> 2:26:27.580]  Why do you think the media is gone from saying it didn't come out of a lab, wasn't the China virus, when Trump had the intel, we had the intel even before him?
[2:26:27.580 --> 2:26:29.580]  Why do you think, Mr. Jones, that's happening?
[2:26:29.580 --> 2:26:36.580]  I honestly have no idea. That's how it was coming to you. I really got interested in it after the vaccine stuff started going down, obviously with the side effects with me.
[2:26:36.580 --> 2:26:42.580]  But yeah, I wanted to know what your perspective was, what the science is saying, whether it's man-made or not.
[2:26:42.580 --> 2:26:49.580]  The science says it's definitely man-made and that way Gates who funded it and Fauci who funded it, the NIH can own it.
[2:26:49.580 --> 2:26:52.580]  It was illegal to do the development of gain of function here in the U.S.
[2:26:52.580 --> 2:26:54.580]  It was being done at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[2:26:54.580 --> 2:27:00.580]  It got transferred in 2015 to Wuhan, so they were just using China to build it.
[2:27:00.580 --> 2:27:10.580]  I think so when the deep state released it, the UN released it, they could then blackmail China and basically threaten China to do what they wanted at the UN level
[2:27:10.580 --> 2:27:12.580]  or they would release the fact that it was a weapon.
[2:27:12.580 --> 2:27:16.580]  But I don't personally think Communist China itself released it.
[2:27:16.580 --> 2:27:22.580]  The globalists released it to put China in the driver's seat and so they would remain open while we actually closed.
[2:27:22.580 --> 2:27:27.580]  But again, the globalists controlled China. I don't think China themselves did it. Does that make sense?
[2:27:27.580 --> 2:27:28.580]  Yeah.
[2:27:28.580 --> 2:27:32.580]  But again, I'm speculating there. We know it's man-made. We know they lie about how deadly it is.
[2:27:32.580 --> 2:27:39.580]  We know that the PCR testing in for someone who's not vaccinated, they say, is 40 times. That shows the false positive.
[2:27:39.580 --> 2:27:43.580]  If you've been vaccinated, they set it to 28, so you always have a false negative.
[2:27:43.580 --> 2:27:46.580]  I mean, they're engineering the fraud in front of us.
[2:27:46.580 --> 2:27:50.580]  You mentioned Bill Gates, though. Why do you think the media has taken Bill Gates down recently?
[2:27:50.580 --> 2:27:56.580]  Well, I mean, a lot of this is the government's not a monolithic thing and the corporations are a monolithic thing.
[2:27:56.580 --> 2:28:03.580]  And a lot of people in government, even billionaires and people that are powerful, it's hard for them to believe this has all happened.
[2:28:03.580 --> 2:28:09.580]  But we were able to prove it to them, and others were, and we explained that they were never going to stop the collapse and the power grab
[2:28:09.580 --> 2:28:12.580]  until it comes out that it was done deliberately.
[2:28:12.580 --> 2:28:17.580]  And so I've called for Gates to be indicted for crimes against humanity.
[2:28:17.580 --> 2:28:21.580]  I've called for Fauci to be indicted for crimes against humanity, for there to be Nuremberg trials.
[2:28:21.580 --> 2:28:29.580]  And I've also said his fact that he was involved with Epstein and sex trafficking, and from our information, he's to come out, and that is going to come out.
[2:28:29.580 --> 2:28:38.580]  And so I think you've got a power struggle inside the corridors of power because they tried to use big tech to suppress the truth.
[2:28:38.580 --> 2:28:42.580]  They launched the attack to try to bring in their U.N. control, but I think it's failing.
[2:28:42.580 --> 2:28:49.580]  And so they're hedging their bets now in case it all comes out to burn Gates and Fauci, where it actually goes much higher than them.
[2:28:49.580 --> 2:28:51.580]  It's these people right here.
[2:28:51.580 --> 2:28:54.580]  That's the World Eugenics Society.
[2:28:54.580 --> 2:28:57.580]  So you think they're going to take out Fauci next?
[2:28:57.580 --> 2:29:04.580]  I don't know if they're going to take him out where he gets indicted or convicted. That may happen.
[2:29:04.580 --> 2:29:11.580]  But he's certainly going to be a pariah and convicted in public.
[2:29:11.580 --> 2:29:15.580]  There's a bigger global force that wants a worldwide ID and wants forced inoculation.
[2:29:15.580 --> 2:29:20.580]  It just doesn't want China and the U.N., the driver seat completely, because then it would get out of control.
[2:29:20.580 --> 2:29:26.580]  So it's balancing between the U.S. and Europe and China and the U.N. and all the different factions.
[2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:30.580]  And so China was trying to keep us closed through their leftist arms.
[2:29:30.580 --> 2:29:33.580]  And the globalists don't want them closed or us closed.
[2:29:33.580 --> 2:29:36.580]  They only wanted to get the straight jacket on and have us reopen.
[2:29:36.580 --> 2:29:41.580]  The China faction was trying to keep us closed.
[2:29:41.580 --> 2:29:50.580]  And so now pressure is being reapplied to the Chinese agents, which Gates is a China file, and to Fauci.
[2:29:50.580 --> 2:29:53.580]  Because, again, they've gotten a little too big for their britches.
[2:29:53.580 --> 2:29:57.580]  And there are bigger spiders back behind the curtain. They're actually controlling it all.
[2:29:57.580 --> 2:30:02.580]  So you think Bill Gates will be prosecuted for the Epstein stuff?
[2:30:02.580 --> 2:30:05.580]  Well, he'll have to step down from his foundation.
[2:30:05.580 --> 2:30:10.580]  And he won't be running the Carnegie Endowment and the IBM Endowment for World Population Production anymore.
[2:30:10.580 --> 2:30:18.580]  He's been actually the head since about 1998 of the World Depopulation Society.
[2:30:18.580 --> 2:30:19.580]  Oh, wow.
[2:30:19.580 --> 2:30:21.580]  Yeah, they've given each other awards.
[2:30:21.580 --> 2:30:23.580]  They've been in charge since then.
[2:30:23.580 --> 2:30:25.580]  And then they see his handling. Here's the biggest thing.
[2:30:25.580 --> 2:30:29.580]  They executed this and it got out of control and hasn't gone as well as they wanted.
[2:30:29.580 --> 2:30:36.580]  And so any general that, you know, tell like Hitler, the first couple years of his war went well, later it didn't go well.
[2:30:36.580 --> 2:30:40.580]  Well, this is already, I mean, they knew it wouldn't go well in five, six years,
[2:30:40.580 --> 2:30:45.580]  but they'd already have a total police state in place and robots instead of troops in place that will follow orders.
[2:30:45.580 --> 2:30:50.580]  But their program is falling apart faster than they thought it would.
[2:30:50.580 --> 2:30:55.580]  And so the Klaus Schwab great reset has been a big failure.
[2:30:55.580 --> 2:30:57.580]  It was very successful up front.
[2:30:57.580 --> 2:31:06.580]  But again, it kind of bogged down in the mud to use a Napoleon analogy or a Hitler analogy going into Russia is the allegory I would use.
[2:31:06.580 --> 2:31:15.580]  And so let's just say the Russian winner has come to their offensive if you want to use a Russian parallel.
[2:31:15.580 --> 2:31:18.580]  And you notice Australia is getting in war footing with China right now.
[2:31:18.580 --> 2:31:20.580]  Yeah, a lot of action down there.
[2:31:20.580 --> 2:31:21.580]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:31:21.580 --> 2:31:26.580]  So there's a lot of China was supposed to only have control of Earth minerals in a big global treaty.
[2:31:26.580 --> 2:31:32.580]  They had an unofficial corporate treaty that's been implemented through the IMF World Bank and the WTO.
[2:31:32.580 --> 2:31:39.580]  And now you notice that they're breaking that agreement and they are militarily taking over.
[2:31:39.580 --> 2:31:41.580]  So the deal was the West will be the military.
[2:31:41.580 --> 2:31:42.580]  China will be the economic power.
[2:31:42.580 --> 2:31:48.580]  World government will swing according to those two multipolar worlds.
[2:31:48.580 --> 2:31:52.580]  And China has gone for takeover.
[2:31:52.580 --> 2:31:55.580]  And so they're now being basically isolated.
[2:31:55.580 --> 2:31:56.580]  Here it is exclusive.
[2:31:56.580 --> 2:32:06.580]  Biden looks abroad for electric vehicle metals blow to U.S. minors said U.S. mines will not be allowed to mine for rare as minerals only China can.
[2:32:06.580 --> 2:32:07.580]  That's Reuters.
[2:32:07.580 --> 2:32:11.580]  We'll see that's them protecting China because Biden's a Chinese agent.
[2:32:11.580 --> 2:32:19.580]  Iron ore futures tumble as Chinese regulators attempt to halt commodity boom.
[2:32:19.580 --> 2:32:23.580]  Biden's gas tax is a pain to the pump.
[2:32:23.580 --> 2:32:27.580]  All of it's about shutting us down because they're all heavily invested.
[2:32:27.580 --> 2:32:28.580]  The globalist are in China.
[2:32:28.580 --> 2:32:31.580]  So there's a China faction and the other faction.
[2:32:31.580 --> 2:32:34.580]  But then there's also good people exposing it.
[2:32:34.580 --> 2:32:39.580]  So now that it's coming out, the other factions going to hedge its bets and may actually burn gates in them.
[2:32:39.580 --> 2:32:40.580]  Hell, we may go to war with China.
[2:32:40.580 --> 2:32:42.580]  They may bring out the China did this with Gates.
[2:32:42.580 --> 2:32:45.580]  You'll see Gates and Fauci arrested and we'll go to war with China.
[2:32:45.580 --> 2:32:48.580]  China is very hostile with Australia right now.
[2:32:48.580 --> 2:32:51.580]  Well, that's because they're going to be exactly because we're going to the globalists are going to use.
[2:32:51.580 --> 2:32:54.580]  I think we, the Americans are part of the globalist system.
[2:32:54.580 --> 2:32:55.580]  I'm not part of the board controlled by it.
[2:32:55.580 --> 2:33:01.580]  But quote, we're the West going to use Australia as the trigger for war with China.
[2:33:01.580 --> 2:33:02.580]  Oh, wow.
[2:33:02.580 --> 2:33:03.580]  Very scary.
[2:33:03.580 --> 2:33:05.580]  I'm sure you've noticed that you're Australian.
[2:33:05.580 --> 2:33:10.580]  The real drums of war, your top generals say war is basically imminent.
[2:33:10.580 --> 2:33:12.580]  Yeah, I mean, it started with a trade war, right?
[2:33:12.580 --> 2:33:13.580]  Yeah.
[2:33:13.580 --> 2:33:15.580]  Well, China infiltrated your universities.
[2:33:15.580 --> 2:33:16.580]  Your government tried to take over.
[2:33:16.580 --> 2:33:17.580]  Yeah.
[2:33:17.580 --> 2:33:18.580]  Yeah.
[2:33:18.580 --> 2:33:20.580]  And so kind of the British Commonwealth really is still in control.
[2:33:20.580 --> 2:33:24.580]  They kind of slapped China's hand and then China has it back down with its operatives inside.
[2:33:24.580 --> 2:33:27.580]  You know, they've got about half your mayors under their control.
[2:33:27.580 --> 2:33:30.580]  So you really think the war is going to happen?
[2:33:30.580 --> 2:33:32.580]  We're already in an economic war.
[2:33:32.580 --> 2:33:35.580]  And again, you can claim there's one global government.
[2:33:35.580 --> 2:33:36.580]  There's really not.
[2:33:36.580 --> 2:33:39.580]  The factions are always at war with us, always want more power.
[2:33:39.580 --> 2:33:42.580]  But they're at the higher levels at war with each other as well.
[2:33:42.580 --> 2:33:46.580]  Think of it as dimensional or like levels to a house.
[2:33:46.580 --> 2:33:47.580]  Say it's a five story house.
[2:33:47.580 --> 2:33:53.580]  You got the general starving public down more than half the world, basically a subsistence level,
[2:33:53.580 --> 2:33:54.580]  almost starving to death.
[2:33:54.580 --> 2:33:55.580]  You have a global lockdown.
[2:33:55.580 --> 2:33:57.580]  They starve to death by the tens of millions more.
[2:33:57.580 --> 2:34:02.580]  And you kind of have the poor people in the West below that, but they're still doing better.
[2:34:02.580 --> 2:34:03.580]  People starve to death.
[2:34:03.580 --> 2:34:07.580]  And then you've got kind of the middle class working class, you know, blue collar up the middle class.
[2:34:07.580 --> 2:34:09.580]  And you've got Nuvo Reach, new rich above that.
[2:34:09.580 --> 2:34:11.580]  And you've got the public rich.
[2:34:11.580 --> 2:34:15.580]  Let's say there's six stories and then the super ultra secret rich above them.
[2:34:15.580 --> 2:34:19.580]  And the super ultra secret rich are very sophisticated and play all sides.
[2:34:19.580 --> 2:34:23.580]  And then you've got the other power structures that either a Chinese agent, a Russian agent,
[2:34:23.580 --> 2:34:27.580]  a U.S. agent, or maybe a corporate agent and a British Commonwealth agent,
[2:34:27.580 --> 2:34:29.580]  which is all interchanging with the U.S.
[2:34:29.580 --> 2:34:32.580]  That's the new Anglo-American Establishment Alliance of Cecil Rhodes.
[2:34:32.580 --> 2:34:34.580]  And what he said about 120 years ago.
[2:34:34.580 --> 2:34:40.580]  And so, but at a higher level, it's actually just a handful of groups manipulating those groups against each other
[2:34:40.580 --> 2:34:42.580]  towards a larger plan in the future.
[2:34:42.580 --> 2:34:45.580]  But you're here and I'm just ranting and raving, folks.
[2:34:45.580 --> 2:34:46.580]  But there's your answer.
[2:34:46.580 --> 2:34:51.580]  We'll be right back.
[2:34:51.580 --> 2:34:56.580]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where Info Wars is.
[2:34:56.580 --> 2:34:59.580]  And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you
[2:34:59.580 --> 2:35:02.580]  because you are the patrons that make all this possible.
[2:35:02.580 --> 2:35:06.580]  So in short, the world's awakening, the spiral of censorship,
[2:35:06.580 --> 2:35:10.580]  Info Wars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger effect
[2:35:10.580 --> 2:35:13.580]  exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[2:35:13.580 --> 2:35:18.580]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down
[2:35:18.580 --> 2:35:22.580]  because most of the best-selling products which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others,
[2:35:22.580 --> 2:35:24.580]  have been sold out for up to seven months.
[2:35:24.580 --> 2:35:25.580]  Well, guess what?
[2:35:25.580 --> 2:35:27.580]  DNA Force Plus just came back in.
[2:35:27.580 --> 2:35:29.580]  Thank God for seven months.
[2:35:29.580 --> 2:35:30.580]  It's 40% off.
[2:35:30.580 --> 2:35:31.580]  It's amazing.
[2:35:31.580 --> 2:35:32.580]  At InfoWarsShore.com.
[2:35:32.580 --> 2:35:34.580]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day,
[2:35:34.580 --> 2:35:37.580]  we have store-wide free shipping and double-patria points.
[2:35:37.580 --> 2:35:39.580]  And alpha powers back in stock.
[2:35:39.580 --> 2:35:41.580]  And super mill vitality is back in stock.

[2:35:44.580 --> 2:35:49.580]  As much as 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points, InfoWarsShore.com.
[2:35:49.580 --> 2:35:51.580]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, Info Warriors.
[2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:54.580]  You know, I'm cutting an ad right now.
[2:35:54.580 --> 2:35:56.580]  And I've been here on the Saturday cutting days.
[2:35:56.580 --> 2:35:59.580]  I've done a terrible job because I've just cut like five ads
[2:35:59.580 --> 2:36:02.580]  and I didn't tell people the most important part.
[2:36:02.580 --> 2:36:07.580]  No, it's not that DNA Force Plus has been sold out for seven months
[2:36:07.580 --> 2:36:09.580]  and it's back in stock and it's 40% off.
[2:36:09.580 --> 2:36:14.580]  Or how the supply chain broke down and how it almost bankrupted us, but thank God, it's finally came in.
[2:36:14.580 --> 2:36:18.580]  Or how it cleans up your mitochondria and makes your telomeres last longer
[2:36:18.580 --> 2:36:19.580]  and can regrow nerves.
[2:36:19.580 --> 2:36:21.580]  You've got to go research DNA Force Plus.
[2:36:21.580 --> 2:36:22.580]  No, it's not that.
[2:36:22.580 --> 2:36:26.580]  The reason I just cut all those ads and forgot the most important point.
[2:36:26.580 --> 2:36:28.580]  The super bowl vitality is back in stock.
[2:36:28.580 --> 2:36:29.580]  50% off.
[2:36:29.580 --> 2:36:30.580]  The prostagards back 40% off.
[2:36:30.580 --> 2:36:33.580]  The alpha powers back 50% off.
[2:36:33.580 --> 2:36:36.580]  The ultra 12, vitamin B12, take another tongue, it's incredible.
[2:36:36.580 --> 2:36:38.580]  It's back also 50% off.
[2:36:38.580 --> 2:36:40.580]  Or vasobes back 50% off.
[2:36:40.580 --> 2:36:41.580]  No, it's dead.
[2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:46.580]  We've got double Patriot points and three shipping store-wide double Patriot points.
[2:36:46.580 --> 2:36:49.580]  Three shipping store-wide on top of the huge sales.
[2:36:52.580 --> 2:36:57.580]  We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials.
[2:36:57.580 --> 2:36:59.580]  And right now we've got store-wide free shipping.
[2:36:59.580 --> 2:37:02.580]  We've got double Patriot points.
[2:37:02.580 --> 2:37:06.580]  We've got 40% off on DNA Force Plus, sold out for seven months.
[2:37:06.580 --> 2:37:12.580]  We've got 50% off on ultra 12, 50% off on vasobes, 50% off on alpha power.
[2:37:12.580 --> 2:37:13.580]  These are all incredible products.
[2:37:13.580 --> 2:37:15.580]  I talk about each one for several minutes.
[2:37:15.580 --> 2:37:17.580]  But a lot of you have already used them, some of you haven't.
[2:37:17.580 --> 2:37:18.580]  You've got to go check these out.
[2:37:18.580 --> 2:37:20.580]  These are all top-of-the-line formulas.
[2:37:20.580 --> 2:37:22.580]  Some of them clones of best sellers.
[2:37:22.580 --> 2:37:27.580]  Others, original formulations that we came up with with top developers to blow people away.
[2:37:27.580 --> 2:37:28.580]  And it's all there.
[2:37:28.580 --> 2:37:33.580]  There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales
[2:37:33.580 --> 2:37:36.580]  and specials to mention them all here today.
[2:37:36.580 --> 2:37:41.580]  But whatever you do, go to infoorestore.com with destroyer free shipping and double Patriot points.
[2:37:41.580 --> 2:37:49.580]  And sold out for seven months, DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 that's been sold out is now back in stock 40% off.
[2:37:49.580 --> 2:37:52.580]  infoorestore.com.
[2:37:52.580 --> 2:37:56.580]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best selling products have been sold out for three months,
[2:37:56.580 --> 2:38:00.580]  four months, six months, seven months, it's not a gimmick to make you buy the products.
[2:38:00.580 --> 2:38:05.580]  I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:09.580]  and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation because they're great products
[2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:11.580]  and we're coming back and getting more and thank you for the support.
[2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:18.580]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's PolymBlock or whether it's SuperModality or VasoBeats,
[2:38:18.580 --> 2:38:23.580]  because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower the quality of our products
[2:38:23.580 --> 2:38:25.580]  and so we just can't offer them.
[2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:30.580]  But thank God it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now
[2:38:30.580 --> 2:38:33.580]  because suddenly a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[2:38:33.580 --> 2:38:36.580]  And one of them is PolymBlock.
[2:38:36.580 --> 2:38:41.580]  It takes a long time to get into PolymBlock, but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like allergies.
[2:38:41.580 --> 2:38:44.580]  It's from France. It's a special proprietary system.
[2:38:44.580 --> 2:38:48.580]  This is the highest quality back in stock infoorestore.com.
[2:38:48.580 --> 2:38:55.580]  Store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points. Check it out.
[2:38:55.580 --> 2:38:58.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:38:58.580 --> 2:39:03.580]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:39:03.580 --> 2:39:15.580]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:39:15.580 --> 2:39:23.580]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:39:24.580 --> 2:39:30.580]  All right. Craig Jones is a very interesting fellow, one of the top jiu jitsu folks in the world.
[2:39:30.580 --> 2:39:33.480]  Folks in the world, his teammates retiring probably
[2:39:33.480 --> 2:39:34.820]  settle making him number one.
[2:39:34.820 --> 2:39:35.780]  They argue who's number one.
[2:39:35.780 --> 2:39:38.020]  We've seen his buddies actually better than him.
[2:39:38.020 --> 2:39:39.740]  But you say a lot during the breaks,
[2:39:39.740 --> 2:39:41.300]  but not a lot on air and you're a great guy.
[2:39:41.300 --> 2:39:43.020]  So we're talking about Eddie Bravo.
[2:39:43.020 --> 2:39:45.860]  We were talking about you're about to also grapple
[2:39:45.860 --> 2:39:47.660]  with a woman that weighs 100 to something pounds
[2:39:47.660 --> 2:39:48.500]  bigger than you.
[2:39:48.500 --> 2:39:49.980]  And we'll try to pull a picture of her up.
[2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:52.420]  So tell us all the same stuff you told me during the breaks.
[2:39:52.420 --> 2:39:54.780]  All right, so Gabby Gussie is huge.
[2:39:54.780 --> 2:39:57.500]  The biggest grappler, biggest female grappler
[2:39:57.500 --> 2:39:58.740]  in the world, I would imagine.
[2:39:58.740 --> 2:39:59.980]  So we're talking she's six, four.
[2:39:59.980 --> 2:40:00.820]  Can we go back?
[2:40:00.820 --> 2:40:01.660]  Is that a real photo?
[2:40:01.660 --> 2:40:02.500]  My goodness.
[2:40:02.500 --> 2:40:04.060]  Yeah, six, four, 280.
[2:40:04.060 --> 2:40:06.100]  There should be even a bigger photo than this, right?
[2:40:06.100 --> 2:40:07.900]  So she's probably, I'm gonna guess,
[2:40:07.900 --> 2:40:08.820]  she's probably gonna kill me for this,
[2:40:08.820 --> 2:40:10.860]  but over 280 pounds.
[2:40:10.860 --> 2:40:13.540]  And she's never been submitted in her whole career.
[2:40:13.540 --> 2:40:15.140]  I think 25 years.
[2:40:15.140 --> 2:40:16.060]  And she always jokes around.
[2:40:16.060 --> 2:40:18.220]  She's like, oh, oh, face anyone that pulls me out.
[2:40:18.220 --> 2:40:20.220]  So I was like, oh, jump on that opportunity.
[2:40:20.220 --> 2:40:21.620]  Where do we find the photo you wanna see?
[2:40:21.620 --> 2:40:24.060]  Cause I, if you go to Google images,
[2:40:24.060 --> 2:40:26.060]  just Gabby Gussie, are you gonna see?
[2:40:26.060 --> 2:40:31.060]  Let's see if we can find one where she's looking enormous.
[2:40:32.140 --> 2:40:34.980]  Yeah, just show all the images, guys.
[2:40:34.980 --> 2:40:38.500]  Just like, do Google or go and then click images
[2:40:38.500 --> 2:40:39.900]  with all the images on screen.
[2:40:39.900 --> 2:40:41.740]  Show the search itself.
[2:40:41.740 --> 2:40:43.140]  There you go.
[2:40:43.140 --> 2:40:45.340]  Yeah, so we're talking a huge woman.
[2:40:45.340 --> 2:40:48.420]  She fights in Japan and we've been going back and forth.
[2:40:48.420 --> 2:40:50.860]  Let's talk a lot of shit to her to try to trigger her.
[2:40:50.860 --> 2:40:52.060]  But we're gonna do the match.
[2:40:52.060 --> 2:40:54.740]  I believe, likely Japan end of the year.
[2:40:54.740 --> 2:40:56.540]  Well, I'm not trying to be mean to her,
[2:40:56.540 --> 2:40:58.700]  but she looks like a big dude.
[2:40:58.700 --> 2:41:00.700]  She looks like Frankenstein.
[2:41:00.700 --> 2:41:04.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean,
[2:41:04.220 --> 2:41:06.180]  that's the whole appeal of the match, right?
[2:41:06.180 --> 2:41:07.220]  Cause I guess like it seems like-
[2:41:07.220 --> 2:41:08.060]  I mean, I'll be honest,
[2:41:08.060 --> 2:41:09.020]  she looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[2:41:09.020 --> 2:41:10.340]  She looks like he's on juice.
[2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:11.980]  She, yeah, I mean, it's probably not natural.
[2:41:11.980 --> 2:41:15.620]  So we've got the tail of the tape here, right?
[2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:17.380]  So yeah, obviously I've exaggerated
[2:41:17.380 --> 2:41:18.460]  a couple of those statistics,
[2:41:18.460 --> 2:41:20.780]  but what's funny is we put this up as a joke,
[2:41:20.780 --> 2:41:22.620]  but a lot of the mainstream media and stuff
[2:41:22.620 --> 2:41:24.980]  saw this and shared it as if it was fact.
[2:41:24.980 --> 2:41:28.180]  Well, I've not seen a lot of women I thought could meet dudes,
[2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:30.020]  but why is it she in the UFC?
[2:41:30.020 --> 2:41:32.620]  My God, well, most of the women I see,
[2:41:32.620 --> 2:41:34.980]  it's like the biological male breaking the girl's face in.
[2:41:34.980 --> 2:41:36.620]  I was like, well, this is the whole thing.
[2:41:36.620 --> 2:41:37.620]  It's like, it's a big task.
[2:41:37.620 --> 2:41:39.900]  It's like, it seems like gender's disappearing in sports.
[2:41:39.900 --> 2:41:42.460]  So I was like, well, we'll see how it goes down.
[2:41:42.460 --> 2:41:44.780]  We put the biggest woman in the world against me.
[2:41:44.780 --> 2:41:46.460]  And I think it'll be pretty entertaining.
[2:41:46.460 --> 2:41:47.540]  I'm not being mean to her,
[2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:50.100]  but you know, there's all those double X, double Y chromosome
[2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:52.260]  deals like some, a lot of your top athlete men
[2:41:52.260 --> 2:41:54.460]  actually have, you know, extra chromosome.
[2:41:54.460 --> 2:41:56.100]  And it looks like she's got something going on,
[2:41:56.100 --> 2:41:56.940]  chromosomal.
[2:41:56.940 --> 2:41:57.780]  I mean,
[2:41:57.780 --> 2:41:58.620]  what do you reckon?
[2:41:58.620 --> 2:42:01.020]  Would you, would you survive the power driver from her?
[2:42:02.020 --> 2:42:02.860]  Probably not.
[2:42:05.300 --> 2:42:07.220]  Yeah. So we had, we had a press conference here.
[2:42:07.220 --> 2:42:08.060]  Is that real?
[2:42:08.060 --> 2:42:09.700]  Yeah.
[2:42:09.700 --> 2:42:11.340]  That's Frankenstein in a wig.
[2:42:12.340 --> 2:42:13.180]  So we had a press.
[2:42:13.180 --> 2:42:15.220]  Wonder what her mom was eating.
[2:42:15.220 --> 2:42:16.060]  Babies, right?
[2:42:16.060 --> 2:42:18.900]  Her mom's probably living inside of you plutonium plants.
[2:42:20.060 --> 2:42:21.060]  We had the press conference
[2:42:21.060 --> 2:42:22.780]  when I dressed up as the white trash outfit.
[2:42:22.780 --> 2:42:24.420]  Cause I was like, could it be a good look?
[2:42:24.420 --> 2:42:25.340]  If I'm facing a woman,
[2:42:25.340 --> 2:42:27.940]  I might as well dress like a wife beta.
[2:42:27.940 --> 2:42:29.380]  But yeah, that should happen at the end of the year.
[2:42:29.380 --> 2:42:30.580]  But I want to talk to you.
[2:42:30.580 --> 2:42:32.700]  She looks like she's going to funk you on the head,
[2:42:32.700 --> 2:42:35.180]  put you over her shoulder and take you to the cave.
[2:42:35.180 --> 2:42:37.220]  Can we put her back up, please?
[2:42:37.220 --> 2:42:38.060]  What's your prediction?
[2:42:38.060 --> 2:42:39.060]  What's going to happen?
[2:42:40.220 --> 2:42:42.300]  Well, I'm predicting that's not natural.
[2:42:43.500 --> 2:42:44.660]  That's what I'm predicting.
[2:42:44.660 --> 2:42:46.300]  Is there going to be drug testing?
[2:42:46.300 --> 2:42:47.140]  No, there's no,
[2:42:47.140 --> 2:42:50.180]  there's really no drug testing at all in grappling.
[2:42:50.180 --> 2:42:51.740]  So yeah, I mean, she's,
[2:42:51.740 --> 2:42:54.660]  she is a freak athlete for sure.
[2:42:54.660 --> 2:42:56.140]  Huge, she's huge in Japan.
[2:42:56.140 --> 2:42:57.580]  Obviously Japanese fans love this.
[2:42:57.580 --> 2:43:01.540]  Yeah, you know, it's almost like Akram Megli's going on there.
[2:43:01.540 --> 2:43:03.740]  Yeah, I mean, I've never seen a woman that big before.
[2:43:03.740 --> 2:43:04.940]  Big, strong Jacks.
[2:43:04.940 --> 2:43:07.660]  She's actually signed a contract with Marvel Studios.
[2:43:07.660 --> 2:43:09.980]  I believe she's going to be the She-Hulk.
[2:43:09.980 --> 2:43:11.300]  Although I think she told me as well,
[2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:13.580]  she's going to be the female Ivan Dragoff.
[2:43:13.580 --> 2:43:16.140]  They make a female Rocky movie.
[2:43:16.140 --> 2:43:16.980]  What do you reckon?
[2:43:16.980 --> 2:43:19.020]  Well, I mean, usually they find these women
[2:43:19.020 --> 2:43:21.500]  like G.I. Jane and it's Demi Moore.
[2:43:21.500 --> 2:43:22.660]  It doesn't make sense.
[2:43:22.660 --> 2:43:24.420]  I would believe if she would actually eat the men.
[2:43:24.420 --> 2:43:26.700]  Like this is like Godzilla.
[2:43:26.700 --> 2:43:28.180]  Actually, you know, she could fight Godzilla,
[2:43:28.180 --> 2:43:30.540]  not Kong versus Godzilla, but this woman.
[2:43:30.540 --> 2:43:33.180]  Why did I know this woman existed?
[2:43:33.180 --> 2:43:34.260]  I wonder if she's going to be,
[2:43:34.260 --> 2:43:35.340]  we should bring her to who's number one.
[2:43:35.340 --> 2:43:36.260]  You should meet her.
[2:43:38.100 --> 2:43:39.260]  Yeah, but she fights in Japan.
[2:43:39.260 --> 2:43:41.900]  She had an MMA fight actually against an old woman in Japan,
[2:43:41.900 --> 2:43:43.140]  like a 50 year old woman.
[2:43:44.220 --> 2:43:45.060]  Crazy.
[2:43:45.980 --> 2:43:47.100]  I don't know if we can find that.
[2:43:47.100 --> 2:43:48.500]  But yeah, I wanted to ask you,
[2:43:48.500 --> 2:43:49.980]  Eddie Bravo, Flat Earth,
[2:43:49.980 --> 2:43:52.420]  where did this Flat Earth movement come from?
[2:43:52.420 --> 2:43:53.260]  He got really big.
[2:43:53.260 --> 2:43:55.100]  And I don't know why Eddie stopped doing shows on him.
[2:43:55.100 --> 2:43:55.940]  It was really popular.
[2:43:55.940 --> 2:43:57.860]  But Eddie told me, he said,
[2:43:57.860 --> 2:44:00.460]  I'm done, I'm focusing on 10th planet.
[2:44:00.460 --> 2:44:04.380]  And he said, and I'm focusing on, you know, my MMA.
[2:44:04.380 --> 2:44:05.220]  And I said, you know,
[2:44:05.220 --> 2:44:06.500]  why is your thing called 10th planet?
[2:44:06.500 --> 2:44:07.340]  You don't believe in planets.
[2:44:07.340 --> 2:44:08.420]  He gets real mad.
[2:44:08.420 --> 2:44:11.420]  But Eddie's super entertaining, super funny, great guy.
[2:44:11.420 --> 2:44:12.700]  And I last time he was here in town,
[2:44:12.700 --> 2:44:13.540]  I went out to dinner with him.
[2:44:13.540 --> 2:44:15.140]  So hopefully, yeah, I didn't always be in town.
[2:44:15.140 --> 2:44:17.540]  We should definitely try to get dinner or something.
[2:44:17.540 --> 2:44:18.380]  You should still do.
[2:44:18.380 --> 2:44:19.220]  I remember on Rogan,
[2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:20.460]  you offered to do the documentary,
[2:44:20.460 --> 2:44:23.340]  Eddie Bravo Flames, The Edge of the World.
[2:44:23.340 --> 2:44:24.380]  Well, I was dead serious
[2:44:24.380 --> 2:44:26.180]  because you could get a pretty big cargo ship
[2:44:26.180 --> 2:44:28.460]  that's safe down in Chile.
[2:44:28.460 --> 2:44:31.260]  And you're only then about a half day sailing or less
[2:44:31.260 --> 2:44:32.900]  to Antarctica.
[2:44:32.900 --> 2:44:34.180]  And then during the warm season,
[2:44:34.180 --> 2:44:36.900]  you could circumnavigate Antarctica.
[2:44:36.900 --> 2:44:38.940]  And I think that would be a giant film.
[2:44:38.940 --> 2:44:40.940]  You know, the Russians, they pioneered it,
[2:44:40.940 --> 2:44:42.100]  but they have the big icebreakers.
[2:44:42.100 --> 2:44:42.940]  We have some too,
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:45.500]  but they keep as part of a US UN deal,
[2:44:45.500 --> 2:44:47.460]  the North Pole Open.
[2:44:47.460 --> 2:44:48.300]  Yeah.
[2:44:48.300 --> 2:44:49.820]  They go in circles year-round,
[2:44:49.820 --> 2:44:51.460]  keeping an open icebreakers.
[2:44:51.460 --> 2:44:53.380]  They don't have to do that at the South Pole
[2:44:53.380 --> 2:44:56.740]  because it doesn't really freeze up to the borders
[2:44:56.740 --> 2:44:59.900]  because there's not Russia and the US up there in Canada.
[2:44:59.900 --> 2:45:04.900]  But I would like to circumnavigate the Antarctica.
[2:45:05.180 --> 2:45:06.980]  They say it would take about a month to do.
[2:45:06.980 --> 2:45:09.020]  Nope, they say people have done it,
[2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:10.340]  but nobody's videotaped it.
[2:45:10.340 --> 2:45:13.980]  And then everybody denying it
[2:45:13.980 --> 2:45:16.220]  would then see the Earth is indeed a sphere.
[2:45:16.220 --> 2:45:17.660]  That would be a great documentary.
[2:45:17.660 --> 2:45:19.500]  That's gonna happen.
[2:45:19.500 --> 2:45:20.780]  I used to talk to Eddie all the time.
[2:45:20.780 --> 2:45:21.620]  He used to call me all the time.
[2:45:21.620 --> 2:45:22.460]  He hardly ever calls me
[2:45:22.460 --> 2:45:23.420]  because we've got such arguments about this.
[2:45:23.420 --> 2:45:25.980]  He stole my friend, Michael Malus.
[2:45:25.980 --> 2:45:27.900]  I told Michael Malus, I don't think all police are bad.
[2:45:27.900 --> 2:45:28.740]  He got really mad at me.
[2:45:28.740 --> 2:45:29.860]  He won't talk to me either anymore.
[2:45:29.860 --> 2:45:31.780]  So I believe the Earth is flat.
[2:45:31.780 --> 2:45:33.660]  So Eddie probably will be my friend again.
[2:45:33.660 --> 2:45:35.900]  And I believe Michael Malus, all police are bad.
[2:45:35.900 --> 2:45:37.220]  What are you gonna see on Friday night?
[2:45:37.220 --> 2:45:38.060]  No, I'm joking.
[2:45:38.060 --> 2:45:38.900]  Me and Eddie are friends.
[2:45:38.900 --> 2:45:39.740]  We talk to him.
[2:45:39.740 --> 2:45:40.580]  He calls me.
[2:45:40.580 --> 2:45:41.420]  So I call him some.
[2:45:41.420 --> 2:45:42.260]  It's just time flies.
[2:45:42.260 --> 2:45:43.100]  And he's really busy.
[2:45:43.100 --> 2:45:45.020]  He's super successful with his 10th planet.
[2:45:45.020 --> 2:45:46.740]  Yeah, 10th planet's probably the biggest.
[2:45:46.740 --> 2:45:47.660]  There's 10th pancake.
[2:45:47.660 --> 2:45:48.500]  10th pancake.
[2:45:48.500 --> 2:45:50.620]  Probably the biggest jiu-jitsu group in the world,
[2:45:50.620 --> 2:45:51.740]  I think these days for sure.
[2:45:51.740 --> 2:45:52.580]  Wow.
[2:45:52.580 --> 2:45:53.540]  Yeah, he's killing it.
[2:45:53.540 --> 2:45:55.260]  And you know, he got trained what later.
[2:45:55.260 --> 2:45:57.420]  He was like, he was a pretty good musician.
[2:45:57.420 --> 2:45:58.260]  Yeah, definitely.
[2:45:58.260 --> 2:45:59.100]  I remember he always used to say
[2:45:59.100 --> 2:46:01.300]  that music wasn't even his,
[2:46:01.300 --> 2:46:02.420]  sorry, music was his passion.
[2:46:02.420 --> 2:46:03.580]  Jiu-jitsu wasn't his passion,
[2:46:03.580 --> 2:46:07.060]  but he still managed to dominate the jiu-jitsu world.
[2:46:07.060 --> 2:46:09.740]  When it really, again, wasn't even his preference.
[2:46:09.740 --> 2:46:11.500]  His music's pretty good, actually.
[2:46:11.500 --> 2:46:12.460]  Yeah, yeah, I've heard some of it.
[2:46:12.460 --> 2:46:14.740]  He used to put his music over the,
[2:46:14.740 --> 2:46:16.220]  he used to do a professional grappling event.
[2:46:16.220 --> 2:46:18.060]  He used to put his music over the highlight rails.
[2:46:18.060 --> 2:46:19.660]  So yeah, it was cool stuff for sure.
[2:46:19.660 --> 2:46:20.740]  What does it do to your body though?
[2:46:20.740 --> 2:46:22.460]  It's had quite a toll on him.
[2:46:22.460 --> 2:46:25.740]  Oh yeah, I'm just sore, injured, broken all the time.
[2:46:25.740 --> 2:46:28.700]  Obviously came in here with a black guy, scratches.
[2:46:28.700 --> 2:46:30.060]  Yeah, it definitely takes a toll.
[2:46:30.060 --> 2:46:32.620]  I don't know how many years I'll do this for,
[2:46:32.620 --> 2:46:33.860]  but I definitely-
[2:46:33.860 --> 2:46:35.060]  Who's your mate?
[2:46:35.060 --> 2:46:35.900]  Who's my mate?
[2:46:36.900 --> 2:46:38.660]  He looks like another fighter that's here.
[2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:39.660]  Oh, Michael Cis?
[2:46:39.660 --> 2:46:40.820]  Yeah, he's the promoter.
[2:46:40.820 --> 2:46:43.780]  He's the promoter for the grappling event on Friday nights.
[2:46:43.780 --> 2:46:45.420]  So he picks all the matchups.
[2:46:45.420 --> 2:46:47.780]  But he's got the Bulldog years too, so he does it.
[2:46:47.780 --> 2:46:48.620]  He does?
[2:46:48.620 --> 2:46:49.980]  I don't even know if he does, actually.
[2:46:49.980 --> 2:46:52.140]  I think he just works on that thing.
[2:46:52.140 --> 2:46:54.180]  But it's good, you think he's looking intimidating.
[2:46:56.180 --> 2:46:58.740]  So, wow, I didn't know you're facing
[2:46:58.740 --> 2:47:03.420]  a female incarnation of Skeletor.
[2:47:03.420 --> 2:47:06.100]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, she's like,
[2:47:06.100 --> 2:47:08.500]  I think she's 37 now, competing 20 years.
[2:47:08.500 --> 2:47:10.180]  And yeah, no woman's ever submitted her.
[2:47:10.180 --> 2:47:13.860]  She has lost matches, but just very, very close matches.
[2:47:13.860 --> 2:47:16.500]  But yeah, she fights in Japan now.
[2:47:16.500 --> 2:47:17.500]  I mean, look at this black woman,
[2:47:17.500 --> 2:47:19.860]  it looks like a midget compared to her.
[2:47:19.860 --> 2:47:22.100]  Yeah, I think, I mean, they can't really find women
[2:47:22.100 --> 2:47:23.260]  the same size as her.
[2:47:24.100 --> 2:47:24.940]  You know, obviously-
[2:47:24.940 --> 2:47:26.220]  Well, you're a pretty big guy,
[2:47:26.220 --> 2:47:27.380]  and you look a little compared to her.
[2:47:27.380 --> 2:47:29.300]  Can we show the photo again?
[2:47:29.300 --> 2:47:30.140]  Where she's right next to you,
[2:47:30.140 --> 2:47:31.420]  it looks like she's about to carry you off.
[2:47:31.420 --> 2:47:32.860]  All right, so what I did for this,
[2:47:32.860 --> 2:47:34.980]  we had a press conference and we had a table in front.
[2:47:34.980 --> 2:47:36.740]  So anytime they made us do the face-off,
[2:47:36.740 --> 2:47:38.460]  I would crouch down behind the table
[2:47:38.460 --> 2:47:39.300]  a little bit just to explain-
[2:47:39.300 --> 2:47:41.180]  Oh, that's why you're a little smaller, okay.
[2:47:41.180 --> 2:47:42.020]  That's not the one, guys.
[2:47:42.020 --> 2:47:43.700]  It's the other one we found.
[2:47:43.700 --> 2:47:45.780]  Go back to Google Images, please.
[2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:46.820]  The crew does a great job.
[2:47:46.820 --> 2:47:48.180]  I'm just in here frustrated.
[2:47:48.180 --> 2:47:50.620]  I should be plugged in with a computer into the internet.
[2:47:50.620 --> 2:47:51.460]  That's what I should do,
[2:47:51.460 --> 2:47:52.300]  and then I can actually show you.
[2:47:52.300 --> 2:47:53.500]  It's the one we showed earlier
[2:47:53.500 --> 2:47:54.820]  where she's looking at him,
[2:47:54.820 --> 2:47:56.540]  she's looking at Jones,
[2:47:56.540 --> 2:47:58.660]  like he's looking forward, she's turned to him.
[2:47:58.660 --> 2:47:59.820]  Doesn't matter.
[2:47:59.820 --> 2:48:03.060]  Tell us, is the event sold out already?
[2:48:03.060 --> 2:48:03.900]  I'm not actually sure.
[2:48:03.900 --> 2:48:05.780]  I think this should be to get still available for sure.
[2:48:05.780 --> 2:48:07.460]  How do people come to this event?
[2:48:07.460 --> 2:48:09.020]  There it is, good job, guys.
[2:48:09.020 --> 2:48:10.100]  That's the one, yeah.
[2:48:10.980 --> 2:48:12.260]  Were you crouching down there?
[2:48:12.260 --> 2:48:14.380]  Yeah, just a little bit, just a little bit.
[2:48:14.380 --> 2:48:15.700]  But she is huge.
[2:48:15.700 --> 2:48:19.020]  Massive arms, just super, super strong.
[2:48:19.020 --> 2:48:20.180]  Now, does she do the MMA,
[2:48:20.180 --> 2:48:21.660]  where they actually strike,
[2:48:21.660 --> 2:48:22.500]  or does she just do the wrap-up?
[2:48:22.500 --> 2:48:23.340]  Yeah, she does both.
[2:48:23.340 --> 2:48:26.180]  So she fights MMA in Japan as well.
[2:48:26.180 --> 2:48:27.580]  Well, obviously, like Japanese,
[2:48:27.580 --> 2:48:29.300]  due to pro wrestling and stuff, love her.
[2:48:29.300 --> 2:48:30.660]  She's like a superhero.
[2:48:30.660 --> 2:48:32.580]  She's like the female Andre the Giant.
[2:48:32.580 --> 2:48:35.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, massive.
[2:48:35.820 --> 2:48:36.780]  That's why it's gonna be so interesting.
[2:48:36.780 --> 2:48:39.020]  Okay, so people want tickets to this event at the Marriott.
[2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:39.860]  What's it called?
[2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:41.660]  This Friday, Austin, Texas.
[2:48:41.660 --> 2:48:43.060]  So yeah, who's number one?
[2:48:43.060 --> 2:48:46.260]  It's gonna be Friday night at the JW Marriott.
[2:48:46.260 --> 2:48:47.460]  Is she gonna be at this?
[2:48:47.460 --> 2:48:48.940]  She's not gonna be at this one.
[2:48:48.940 --> 2:48:51.060]  She was at one of the previous ones, though.
[2:48:51.060 --> 2:48:52.540]  Okay, cause I was probably gonna go,
[2:48:52.540 --> 2:48:54.700]  but I wanna be a good boy and not drink or anything.
[2:48:54.700 --> 2:48:57.340]  But if she, I gotta go see this light.
[2:48:57.340 --> 2:48:58.980]  I gotta admit, I'm kind of turned on by her.
[2:48:58.980 --> 2:49:01.500]  My wife, I'm leaving you, I'm marrying her.
[2:49:02.500 --> 2:49:03.940]  Maybe we're gonna fly her in.
[2:49:05.060 --> 2:49:08.420]  Oh my gosh, absolutely, I can sit on her knee.
[2:49:09.780 --> 2:49:10.940]  That would be perfect.
[2:49:10.940 --> 2:49:12.700]  Oh my gosh.
[2:49:12.700 --> 2:49:14.980]  I'm not trying to be mean, but I mean, my goodness.
[2:49:14.980 --> 2:49:17.780]  She has an OnlyFans account, you know the OnlyFans?
[2:49:17.780 --> 2:49:20.660]  So you could subscribe, you wanna have a look.
[2:49:20.660 --> 2:49:21.500]  Oh my gosh.
[2:49:22.580 --> 2:49:24.180]  You know, in some pictures, she looks like a girl
[2:49:24.180 --> 2:49:25.580]  in others, she looks like Frankenstein,
[2:49:25.580 --> 2:49:27.180]  or is that an older photo?
[2:49:27.180 --> 2:49:28.620]  I'm not sure, to be honest.
[2:49:28.620 --> 2:49:31.100]  All right, Craig Jones, I'm glad Joe Rogan
[2:49:31.100 --> 2:49:32.340]  got us in contact together
[2:49:32.340 --> 2:49:34.580]  and told me about your plight with the injection.
[2:49:34.580 --> 2:49:36.860]  We really thank you, and good luck this Friday
[2:49:36.860 --> 2:49:38.460]  coming up with your raffle.
[2:49:38.460 --> 2:49:39.660]  Thank you, thank you, sir.
[2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:41.000]  Thank you, yeah.
[2:49:42.500 --> 2:49:44.140]  I'm not gonna say this five times
[2:49:44.140 --> 2:49:45.900]  on the road of the obnoxious.
[2:49:45.900 --> 2:49:47.540]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory
[2:49:47.540 --> 2:49:49.060]  over these criminals.
[2:49:49.060 --> 2:49:53.220]  Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:56.860]  that roughly half of the CDC's top brass
[2:49:56.860 --> 2:49:59.740]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses,
[2:49:59.740 --> 2:50:02.460]  you name it, have taken the so-called COVID-19
[2:50:02.460 --> 2:50:05.300]  Frankenstein, I'm gonna say it the second time.
[2:50:05.300 --> 2:50:09.660]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH
[2:50:09.660 --> 2:50:13.300]  refused to take the Frankenshots.
[2:50:13.300 --> 2:50:16.220]  They don't trust it, you shouldn't trust it.
[2:50:16.220 --> 2:50:17.980]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries
[2:50:17.980 --> 2:50:18.940]  around the world.
[2:50:18.940 --> 2:50:21.060]  This is an attack on the American people,
[2:50:21.060 --> 2:50:22.080]  the people of the world.
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:25.940]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[2:50:25.940 --> 2:50:28.220]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[2:50:28.220 --> 2:50:31.900]  Around half the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC,
[2:50:31.900 --> 2:50:34.060]  the medical staff refused to take the vaccines.
[2:50:34.060 --> 2:50:36.540]  That's right, the doctors, nurses, scientists
[2:50:36.540 --> 2:50:38.420]  do not trust a so-called vaccine,
[2:50:38.420 --> 2:50:39.660]  and you shouldn't either,
[2:50:39.660 --> 2:50:41.780]  and everyone you know about the truth.
[2:50:43.380 --> 2:50:45.700]  I'm giving you a status report
[2:50:45.700 --> 2:50:49.140]  on what your support of Info Wars has done.
[2:50:49.140 --> 2:50:53.260]  We are kicking globalist ass up and down the planet right now.
[2:50:53.260 --> 2:50:55.700]  Their entire agenda of depopulation,
[2:50:55.700 --> 2:50:57.660]  poison vaccines, it's all coming out.
[2:50:57.660 --> 2:50:59.180]  And yes, I'm risking my life,
[2:50:59.180 --> 2:51:00.540]  and yes, this is very dangerous.
[2:51:00.540 --> 2:51:02.740]  But it's worth it, I'm very honored to be in the fight,
[2:51:02.740 --> 2:51:04.620]  so thanks for keeping me in the fight,
[2:51:04.620 --> 2:51:06.900]  and our great crew here at Info Wars.
[2:51:06.900 --> 2:51:08.980]  And here's the other good news.

[2:51:16.660 --> 2:51:18.740]  your telomeres, your nerves.
[2:51:18.740 --> 2:51:20.500]  Everything that PQQ the CoQ10,
[2:51:20.500 --> 2:51:22.900]  look at the other ingredients, they all go together.
[2:51:22.900 --> 2:51:25.100]  This incredible formula are our number one best sellers

[2:51:45.900 --> 2:51:48.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:48.940 --> 2:51:55.620]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson is scheduled to take over here
[2:51:55.620 --> 2:51:57.140]  in just a few minutes.
[2:51:57.140 --> 2:51:59.740]  I'm gonna be hosting tonight at 6 p.m. Central,
[2:51:59.740 --> 2:52:03.220]  a Nick Point as Robert Barnes Debate.
[2:52:04.220 --> 2:52:06.340]  And again, we'll talk for about 30 minutes
[2:52:06.340 --> 2:52:08.820]  about world events, the Mideast Crisis,
[2:52:08.820 --> 2:52:10.180]  and the other big news.
[2:52:10.180 --> 2:52:13.620]  And I'm gonna be hosting tonight at 6 p.m. Central,
[2:52:13.620 --> 2:52:17.500]  a Nick Point as Robert Barnes Debate.
[2:52:17.500 --> 2:52:19.180]  World events, the Mideast Crisis,
[2:52:19.180 --> 2:52:20.860]  that's gonna be ongoing.
[2:52:20.860 --> 2:52:22.180]  And then at 6 p.m. Central,
[2:52:22.180 --> 2:52:23.940]  is when the actual debate's gonna happen.
[2:52:23.940 --> 2:52:25.980]  And I'm not gonna talk very much.
[2:52:25.980 --> 2:52:28.220]  I'm gonna just make sure the time limit
[2:52:28.220 --> 2:52:30.660]  on each person is done properly.
[2:52:30.660 --> 2:52:32.260]  And then I do have a few questions
[2:52:32.260 --> 2:52:34.100]  and we'll redirect things that people get
[2:52:34.100 --> 2:52:36.820]  off of the subject and the topic.
[2:52:36.820 --> 2:52:38.460]  And I wanna host more debates here.
[2:52:38.460 --> 2:52:39.700]  So I'm gonna try to do a really good job
[2:52:39.700 --> 2:52:42.260]  and not interject myself like mainstream media does,
[2:52:42.260 --> 2:52:43.580]  because these are not really debates.
[2:52:43.580 --> 2:52:45.940]  Now, like these congressional commissions
[2:52:45.940 --> 2:52:49.260]  aren't investigations, they are one-sided witch hunts.
[2:52:50.580 --> 2:52:52.180]  So that is coming up.
[2:52:52.180 --> 2:52:54.500]  Intriguing question from the caller.
[2:52:54.500 --> 2:52:56.380]  And I've talked some about this before the caller brought it up,
[2:52:56.380 --> 2:52:58.980]  but I haven't gotten into it a lot because I don't know.
[2:53:00.100 --> 2:53:01.300]  When I don't know something,
[2:53:01.300 --> 2:53:03.540]  I will not tell you that I know it.
[2:53:03.540 --> 2:53:05.540]  I have a good idea.
[2:53:05.540 --> 2:53:06.580]  And let me just say this,
[2:53:06.580 --> 2:53:08.860]  there's not some all-powerful global government yet.
[2:53:08.860 --> 2:53:10.020]  They're trying to get it in place.
[2:53:10.020 --> 2:53:12.180]  There's not one monolithic elite yet.
[2:53:12.180 --> 2:53:13.260]  That's why I try to get them all together
[2:53:13.260 --> 2:53:14.860]  at the Davos Group in Bilderberg
[2:53:14.860 --> 2:53:17.100]  and create a consensus.
[2:53:17.100 --> 2:53:19.460]  And then if you're a billionaire or an influential person
[2:53:19.460 --> 2:53:21.220]  that isn't part of this consensus,
[2:53:21.220 --> 2:53:23.860]  they'll target you and bully you and try to shut you up.
[2:53:23.860 --> 2:53:25.580]  But people don't wanna get rid of America
[2:53:25.580 --> 2:53:27.580]  and get rid of the guns and get rid of our families
[2:53:27.580 --> 2:53:30.580]  and sterilize everyone and put the Communist Chinese in charge
[2:53:30.580 --> 2:53:33.020]  and have all this anti-American Hollywood crap.
[2:53:33.020 --> 2:53:34.020]  This is unpopular.
[2:53:35.100 --> 2:53:38.100]  And so the fact that they did create it at the lab,
[2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:41.260]  the fact that they did move it there, Obama and Fauci,
[2:53:41.260 --> 2:53:45.580]  and the fact that they've used that to keep us locked down,
[2:53:45.580 --> 2:53:47.900]  that's going to come out because we're on air
[2:53:47.900 --> 2:53:49.100]  because of you.
[2:53:49.100 --> 2:53:53.060]  So what I know is all the experts, all the scientists,
[2:53:53.060 --> 2:53:56.820]  all the doctors, all the insiders, all the whistleblowers,
[2:53:56.820 --> 2:53:59.060]  and then having platforms like this to get it out,
[2:53:59.060 --> 2:54:01.340]  having a wonderful audience of activists
[2:54:02.300 --> 2:54:05.100]  that are just as important as the vice president
[2:54:05.100 --> 2:54:06.380]  of Pfizer going public
[2:54:06.380 --> 2:54:08.620]  or the head EU advisor going public
[2:54:08.620 --> 2:54:12.180]  or all the other scientists and doctors going public.
[2:54:12.180 --> 2:54:14.300]  You've been warning people, you've been talking,
[2:54:14.300 --> 2:54:17.340]  you've been pointing out that the PCR test is turned up
[2:54:17.340 --> 2:54:18.540]  so everybody's false positive
[2:54:18.540 --> 2:54:20.740]  or that the hospitals were empty a year ago
[2:54:20.740 --> 2:54:22.500]  but now full from the vaccine
[2:54:22.500 --> 2:54:24.740]  or that most people dying already took the shot
[2:54:24.740 --> 2:54:26.060]  or that people would have had the vaccine
[2:54:26.060 --> 2:54:27.620]  or told take the shot when they even admitted
[2:54:27.620 --> 2:54:28.540]  medic can kill you.
[2:54:29.940 --> 2:54:32.780]  Or that the media is censoring deaths and illnesses.
[2:54:32.780 --> 2:54:35.020]  So people already know this is bull
[2:54:35.020 --> 2:54:37.820]  and when you got half the NIH doctors and scientists
[2:54:37.820 --> 2:54:39.180]  refusing to take the shot.
[2:54:39.180 --> 2:54:42.740]  That's congressional testimony a week ago, two weeks ago.
[2:54:42.740 --> 2:54:44.300]  That's not something that's popular.
[2:54:44.300 --> 2:54:45.620]  They've really jumped the shark.
[2:54:45.620 --> 2:54:47.860]  They've gone whole hog with their whole agenda
[2:54:47.860 --> 2:54:50.140]  because globalism was collapsing all over the world,
[2:54:50.140 --> 2:54:51.300]  because they were in trouble,
[2:54:51.300 --> 2:54:53.300]  because the new order wasn't popular.
[2:54:54.300 --> 2:54:55.660]  Populism was on the march.
[2:54:55.660 --> 2:54:57.700]  And so what has Kerry said?
[2:54:57.700 --> 2:55:00.500]  What has Swab said trying to act like they're powerful?
[2:55:00.500 --> 2:55:02.060]  They've been honest and said,
[2:55:02.060 --> 2:55:06.100]  we're using the lockdown to shut down the yellow vest movement
[2:55:06.100 --> 2:55:07.140]  and the populist movement
[2:55:07.140 --> 2:55:08.860]  and to change the subject
[2:55:08.860 --> 2:55:11.580]  and to give dictatorial excuses for total power
[2:55:11.580 --> 2:55:14.140]  to governments with the Australian government
[2:55:14.140 --> 2:55:16.420]  and the British government and the French government
[2:55:16.420 --> 2:55:18.020]  and the Canadian and so many others
[2:55:18.020 --> 2:55:19.980]  and then every blue city in our country
[2:55:21.220 --> 2:55:22.940]  and the teachers unions and all of them
[2:55:22.940 --> 2:55:24.540]  wanting a permanent lockdown,
[2:55:25.500 --> 2:55:28.580]  which will cause total starvation and total collapse.
[2:55:28.580 --> 2:55:31.420]  And a big portion of that consensus in the elites
[2:55:31.420 --> 2:55:33.180]  don't want that.
[2:55:33.180 --> 2:55:36.900]  They wanna have a UN test for a real biological release.
[2:55:36.900 --> 2:55:38.740]  They wanna have a global martial law plan
[2:55:38.740 --> 2:55:40.060]  in case an asteroid comes.
[2:55:40.060 --> 2:55:41.140]  That's their excuse.
[2:55:41.140 --> 2:55:42.460]  That's how they got some of the other people
[2:55:42.460 --> 2:55:43.300]  to go along with it.
[2:55:43.300 --> 2:55:45.500]  But now they're going, this isn't about asteroids.
[2:55:45.500 --> 2:55:48.660]  This isn't about a real bio-release or a real terror attack.
[2:55:48.660 --> 2:55:51.180]  This is you doing it for a power grab.
[2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:53.700]  This wasn't about a UN planetary drill.
[2:55:53.700 --> 2:55:55.380]  We didn't sign on to world government
[2:55:55.380 --> 2:55:57.060]  to kill everybody and starve everybody.
[2:55:57.060 --> 2:55:58.500]  We signed on for peace.
[2:55:58.500 --> 2:56:00.900]  Well, they're finding out it ain't about peace.
[2:56:01.940 --> 2:56:03.380]  Inside the establishment,
[2:56:03.380 --> 2:56:06.260]  I've talked to highest level people that said, yes, Alex,
[2:56:06.260 --> 2:56:07.860]  I was brought into the whole world government,
[2:56:07.860 --> 2:56:08.940]  everything you said.
[2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:10.260]  We were told it was for peace here, right?
[2:56:10.260 --> 2:56:11.980]  It's not, we apologize to you.
[2:56:13.460 --> 2:56:18.460]  Okay, heads of agencies, CIA, NSA, heads,
[2:56:19.220 --> 2:56:22.540]  members of Congress, top, top show house, all of it.
[2:56:22.540 --> 2:56:23.980]  Cause I've gotten to the top,
[2:56:23.980 --> 2:56:25.940]  which is a horrible place, by the way.
[2:56:25.940 --> 2:56:27.780]  And the top is a bunch of scared people
[2:56:27.780 --> 2:56:30.380]  going along with a bunch of bullies like swab and gates
[2:56:30.380 --> 2:56:33.020]  and people are sick of them and what they're doing.
[2:56:33.020 --> 2:56:34.540]  Well, the music's up and down here.
[2:56:34.540 --> 2:56:36.460]  It's a roller coaster on the show, isn't it?
[2:56:36.460 --> 2:56:40.500]  DNA Force Plus, ladies and gentlemen, is back in stock
[2:56:40.500 --> 2:56:42.660]  and we got four wide free shipping double Patriot points,
[2:56:42.660 --> 2:56:43.980]  biggest sale yet of the year.
[2:56:43.980 --> 2:56:45.460]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:56:48.060 --> 2:56:50.020]  I've got some really good news for the viewers
[2:56:50.020 --> 2:56:52.020]  and Westerners this broadcast.
[2:56:52.020 --> 2:56:53.860]  And then I've got some really, really, really,
[2:56:53.860 --> 2:56:55.580]  really, really good news.
[2:56:55.580 --> 2:56:56.940]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you
[2:56:56.940 --> 2:56:58.740]  about how the globals are getting exposed
[2:56:58.740 --> 2:57:00.700]  and how they launched COVID-19.
[2:57:00.700 --> 2:57:03.100]  There's a bio weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates
[2:57:03.100 --> 2:57:04.180]  and Fauci are in.
[2:57:04.180 --> 2:57:06.380]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against
[2:57:06.380 --> 2:57:07.980]  the public president Biden and saying,
[2:57:07.980 --> 2:57:10.820]  we're gonna have $1,000 five to try to make people wear masks.
[2:57:10.820 --> 2:57:12.420]  I could tell you about all of that,
[2:57:12.420 --> 2:57:15.020]  but why shouldn't I instead tell you about
[2:57:15.020 --> 2:57:17.700]  the super good news concerning the M4?
[2:57:17.700 --> 2:57:18.700]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:57:18.700 --> 2:57:21.700]  we are running right now, the Memorial Day Special
[2:57:21.700 --> 2:57:26.060]  for the next week only with store-wide free shipping,
[2:57:26.060 --> 2:57:29.100]  double Patriot points, and D-Series.
[2:57:29.100 --> 2:57:33.580]  Patriot points and DNA Force Plus is back in stock.
[2:57:33.580 --> 2:57:36.020]  Sold out for seven months, 40% off.

[2:57:44.740 --> 2:57:45.740]  and Patriot points.
[2:57:45.740 --> 2:57:48.220]  And it comes in four, and it's incredible products,
[2:57:48.220 --> 2:57:49.540]  and George Soros hates it.
[2:57:49.540 --> 2:57:50.380]  Ha-ha!
[2:57:53.900 --> 2:57:58.700]  Transmuting Worldwide from the summit.newstudios
[2:57:58.700 --> 2:58:00.460]  in the United Kingdom.
[2:58:00.460 --> 2:58:03.740]  You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:58:06.980 --> 2:58:07.820]  You know what?
[2:58:07.820 --> 2:58:10.100]  It is the Summit News Hour,
[2:58:10.100 --> 2:58:12.020]  and we're gonna talk about what is unfolding
[2:58:12.020 --> 2:58:14.820]  or what has unfolded over the past couple of hours.
[2:58:14.820 --> 2:58:17.820]  At George Floyd Square on the one-year anniversary
[2:58:17.820 --> 2:58:21.780]  of the death of George Floyd gunshots ringing out while
[2:58:21.780 --> 2:58:24.620]  news reporters literally talk about needing to reform
[2:58:24.620 --> 2:58:27.220]  the police, because the police are really the problem
[2:58:27.220 --> 2:58:28.980]  here, aren't they?
[2:58:28.980 --> 2:58:31.220]  Meantime in the United Kingdom over the weekend
[2:58:31.220 --> 2:58:34.620]  on Sunday, the early hours of Sunday morning,
[2:58:34.620 --> 2:58:38.820]  a tragic incident where perhaps the premier leader
[2:58:38.820 --> 2:58:41.140]  of Black Lives Matter in the United Kingdom
[2:58:41.140 --> 2:58:42.700]  was shot in the head.
[2:58:42.700 --> 2:58:46.220]  Black Lives Matter agitators, activists immediately tried
[2:58:46.220 --> 2:58:50.900]  to suggest, claim that that was some kind of targeted attack,
[2:58:50.900 --> 2:58:54.020]  that the individual who was shot had received death threats,
[2:58:54.020 --> 2:58:57.020]  political death threats, and it was a deliberate attack
[2:58:57.020 --> 2:58:59.860]  by anti-Black Lives Matter people.
[2:58:59.860 --> 2:59:01.340]  Turns out that she was shot in the head
[2:59:01.340 --> 2:59:02.980]  by four Black gang members.
[2:59:02.980 --> 2:59:06.380]  We're gonna get into that in the next segment,
[2:59:06.380 --> 2:59:09.340]  because CNN, by the way, is still literally refusing
[2:59:09.340 --> 2:59:12.620]  to report what the Metropolitan Police are saying now
[2:59:12.620 --> 2:59:15.260]  in London, that it was a Black crime gang
[2:59:15.260 --> 2:59:18.540]  that shot her in the head trying to gin up this narrative
[2:59:18.540 --> 2:59:20.900]  that it was some kind of politically targeted attack.
[2:59:20.900 --> 2:59:22.220]  It wasn't.
[2:59:22.220 --> 2:59:23.620]  So we're gonna get into that.
[2:59:23.620 --> 2:59:25.740]  But of course, over the past couple of days,
[2:59:25.740 --> 2:59:28.460]  perhaps the biggest news story that we have covered,
[2:59:28.460 --> 2:59:30.900]  that we have seen in weeks,
[2:59:30.900 --> 2:59:35.900]  is the damn breaking on the Wuhan Lab leak theory.
[2:59:36.580 --> 2:59:39.860]  Now, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic,
[2:59:39.860 --> 2:59:42.060]  as I've documented on many occasions,
[2:59:42.060 --> 2:59:45.420]  when we were saying, yes, this is a serious situation,
[2:59:45.420 --> 2:59:47.060]  we should close the borders,
[2:59:47.060 --> 2:59:50.900]  we should at least impose some restrictions temporarily,
[2:59:50.900 --> 2:59:53.100]  you had the likes of Nancy Pelosi,
[2:59:53.100 --> 2:59:55.180]  Governor Cuomo, and others come out and say,
[2:59:55.180 --> 2:59:58.460]  no, it's racist to suggest that we should impose
[2:59:58.460 --> 3:00:01.060]  any kind of restrictions on border controls
[3:00:01.060 --> 3:00:03.700]  to stop this pandemic from spreading whatsoever.
[3:00:03.700 --> 3:00:06.580]  Nancy Pelosi literally gave press conferences
[3:00:06.580 --> 3:00:08.460]  in the middle of Chinatown,
[3:00:08.460 --> 3:00:11.380]  saying everybody should gather in large numbers.
[3:00:11.380 --> 3:00:13.780]  Cuomo made similar statements.
[3:00:13.780 --> 3:00:16.820]  We had, mayors in Florence, Italy,
[3:00:16.820 --> 3:00:19.100]  of course, Italy became the major hub in Europe
[3:00:19.100 --> 3:00:22.220]  of the spread of coronavirus after China,
[3:00:22.220 --> 3:00:25.820]  literally encouraging people to hug Chinese people
[3:00:25.820 --> 3:00:28.500]  on the street to prove they were racist.
[3:00:29.580 --> 3:00:33.220]  The WHO, as late as late February,
[3:00:33.220 --> 3:00:36.180]  was still coming out with recommendations with advice,
[3:00:36.180 --> 3:00:39.780]  telling countries across Europe and the world
[3:00:39.780 --> 3:00:42.460]  to not impose any kind of border restrictions
[3:00:42.460 --> 3:00:43.900]  because that would, quote,
[3:00:43.900 --> 3:00:47.140]  be stigmatizing against Chinese people.
[3:00:47.140 --> 3:00:48.540]  Now, if they'd done that,
[3:00:48.540 --> 3:00:50.580]  millions of lives could have been saved,
[3:00:50.580 --> 3:00:53.020]  but it was more important at the time
[3:00:53.020 --> 3:00:55.420]  to not be seen as racist
[3:00:55.420 --> 3:00:57.700]  than to save millions of lives.
[3:00:57.700 --> 3:01:00.460]  Well, now the Wuhan lab leak theory,
[3:01:00.460 --> 3:01:03.780]  the dam was broken for the past year,
[3:01:03.780 --> 3:01:05.820]  almost the past year,
[3:01:05.820 --> 3:01:08.540]  fact checkers, social media networks,
[3:01:08.540 --> 3:01:11.220]  mainstream media entities have said
[3:01:11.220 --> 3:01:13.940]  that anyone who talks about this in a credible way
[3:01:13.940 --> 3:01:17.180]  and suggests that the virus was either deliberately
[3:01:17.180 --> 3:01:19.100]  or accidentally leaked from the Wuhan lab
[3:01:19.100 --> 3:01:20.940]  is a conspiracy theorist is spreading
[3:01:20.940 --> 3:01:22.700]  dangerous misinformation,
[3:01:22.700 --> 3:01:24.620]  should be banned off of social media,
[3:01:24.620 --> 3:01:28.180]  their content removed, blacklisted, censored.
[3:01:28.180 --> 3:01:31.860]  Well, they've suddenly changed their tune, haven't they?
[3:01:31.860 --> 3:01:35.100]  We had this article up yesterday on summit.news,
[3:01:35.100 --> 3:01:37.060]  questions over social media censorship
[3:01:37.060 --> 3:01:41.860]  of Wuhan lab leak after Fauci admits possibility.
[3:01:41.860 --> 3:01:44.620]  Now, of course, Fauci admitted the possibility
[3:01:44.620 --> 3:01:47.900]  hours before we had this Wall Street Journal report,
[3:01:47.900 --> 3:01:50.620]  which was a US intelligence report,
[3:01:50.620 --> 3:01:52.420]  revealing that three researchers
[3:01:52.420 --> 3:01:54.340]  at the Wuhan Institute of Virology
[3:01:54.340 --> 3:01:57.340]  became so sick in November, 2019,
[3:01:57.340 --> 3:02:02.500]  with COVID-19 symptoms that they required hospital treatment.
[3:02:02.500 --> 3:02:03.940]  Remember, Trump, again,
[3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:06.140]  was called a dangerous conspiracy theorist,
[3:02:06.140 --> 3:02:08.860]  a bigot for calling it the China virus.
[3:02:08.860 --> 3:02:11.420]  He was called a peddler of misinformation,
[3:02:11.420 --> 3:02:14.460]  dangerous fake news for saying there's a possibility
[3:02:14.460 --> 3:02:15.740]  it came from the lab.
[3:02:15.740 --> 3:02:18.940]  Well, he was right, the conspiracy theorists were right,
[3:02:18.940 --> 3:02:22.180]  and now they're having to admit it.
[3:02:22.180 --> 3:02:24.940]  And yet we've placed all this power,
[3:02:24.940 --> 3:02:27.340]  which has been abused time and time again
[3:02:27.340 --> 3:02:29.220]  into the hands of fact-checkers,
[3:02:29.220 --> 3:02:31.060]  into the hands of Mark Zuckerberg,
[3:02:31.060 --> 3:02:33.140]  into the hands of Jack Dorsey,
[3:02:33.140 --> 3:02:35.540]  the social media oligarchs,
[3:02:35.540 --> 3:02:37.620]  into the hands of the mainstream media
[3:02:37.620 --> 3:02:39.540]  to define what is fake news,
[3:02:39.540 --> 3:02:41.220]  what is misinformation,
[3:02:41.220 --> 3:02:43.620]  and then to punish, ostracize,
[3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:47.420]  publicly shame, and the platform people who share it.
[3:02:47.420 --> 3:02:52.220]  Well, all those people have been proven spectacularly wrong.
[3:02:52.220 --> 3:02:54.140]  Are they going to do an apology tour?
[3:02:54.140 --> 3:02:55.420]  Are they going to reassess
[3:02:55.420 --> 3:02:58.380]  the dangerous misinformation scandal,
[3:02:58.380 --> 3:03:01.460]  which indeed is now on them,
[3:03:01.460 --> 3:03:03.900]  if it does indeed be proven
[3:03:03.900 --> 3:03:06.300]  that this virus emerged from the Wuhan lab
[3:03:06.300 --> 3:03:08.940]  and that the mainstream media was complicit
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:11.660]  in covering it up by amplifying Chinese,
[3:03:11.660 --> 3:03:14.300]  communist state government propaganda
[3:03:14.300 --> 3:03:18.700]  that complicit in one of the biggest cover-ups of all time.
[3:03:18.700 --> 3:03:20.820]  And that cover-up was facilitated
[3:03:20.820 --> 3:03:24.220]  by these fact-checkers claiming the power
[3:03:24.220 --> 3:03:26.260]  to define reality.
[3:03:26.260 --> 3:03:29.860]  Should these people really be given any power anymore,
[3:03:29.860 --> 3:03:32.300]  any respect, any legitimacy,
[3:03:32.300 --> 3:03:34.660]  I would suggest not.
[3:03:34.660 --> 3:03:38.580]  The headline here of reclaimedthenet.org,
[3:03:38.580 --> 3:03:41.100]  and there you go through some of the examples of where,
[3:03:41.100 --> 3:03:45.500]  before Fauci and before Biden's current CDC director,
[3:03:45.500 --> 3:03:47.340]  of course, Trump's CDC director,
[3:03:47.340 --> 3:03:50.260]  said basically it was likely that it came from the lab.
[3:03:50.260 --> 3:03:54.660]  Now Fauci, Biden's CDC director is saying it's possible.
[3:03:54.660 --> 3:03:57.220]  We've got the UK government saying it's possible.
[3:03:57.220 --> 3:03:59.620]  We've got esteemed scientific groups
[3:03:59.620 --> 3:04:01.860]  saying it should be investigated once again.
[3:04:01.860 --> 3:04:03.700]  Remember the WHO?
[3:04:03.700 --> 3:04:06.380]  They have already investigated this apparently.
[3:04:06.380 --> 3:04:08.940]  That investigation comprised of a few of them
[3:04:08.940 --> 3:04:11.420]  visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology
[3:04:11.420 --> 3:04:14.780]  for about three hours a few months ago,
[3:04:14.780 --> 3:04:16.420]  asking the researchers,
[3:04:16.420 --> 3:04:19.140]  oh, by the way, did you leak this virus from the lab?
[3:04:19.140 --> 3:04:20.300]  No.
[3:04:20.300 --> 3:04:21.140]  All right, bye.
[3:04:21.140 --> 3:04:22.700]  See you, investigation over.
[3:04:23.820 --> 3:04:25.820]  That's literally what happened.
[3:04:25.820 --> 3:04:28.820]  They put the lid on it after asking the,
[3:04:28.820 --> 3:04:33.460]  it's like asking Ted Bundy, did you behead these women?
[3:04:33.460 --> 3:04:34.300]  No, I didn't do that.
[3:04:34.300 --> 3:04:35.860]  All right, no worries.
[3:04:35.860 --> 3:04:36.700]  See you, Ted.
[3:04:36.700 --> 3:04:37.540]  Bye.
[3:04:37.540 --> 3:04:39.220]  What the hell?
[3:04:40.540 --> 3:04:43.780]  So for almost a year, people have been banned,
[3:04:43.780 --> 3:04:47.660]  censored, remember the initial scientists in China
[3:04:47.660 --> 3:04:48.940]  were literally arrested.
[3:04:48.940 --> 3:04:50.540]  Some of them disappeared.
[3:04:50.540 --> 3:04:53.460]  Some of them were killed by the Chinese government.
[3:04:53.460 --> 3:04:55.500]  They're merely saying that there was a coronavirus
[3:04:55.500 --> 3:04:59.260]  outbreak in the first place in November and December.
[3:05:00.220 --> 3:05:03.140]  The Chinese Communist Party told the WHO
[3:05:03.140 --> 3:05:05.100]  there was no human to human transmission.
[3:05:05.100 --> 3:05:08.820]  They amplified that as late as mid-January.
[3:05:10.060 --> 3:05:13.140]  But we're supposed to trust the esteemed health authorities
[3:05:13.140 --> 3:05:15.500]  because they've got it right at every turn, haven't they?
[3:05:15.500 --> 3:05:17.420]  Well, no, it's the exact opposite.
[3:05:18.460 --> 3:05:20.260]  So, yeah, reclamation.org headline.
[3:05:20.260 --> 3:05:22.660]  After many were banned online for saying it,
[3:05:22.660 --> 3:05:25.020]  it's finally admitted that Wilhelm Lab leak
[3:05:25.020 --> 3:05:27.060]  may not be a conspiracy theory.
[3:05:27.060 --> 3:05:28.100]  Oh, my God.
[3:05:29.660 --> 3:05:32.380]  So again, they provide many cases.
[3:05:32.380 --> 3:05:35.500]  In February 2020, Twitter permanently suspended Harry
[3:05:35.500 --> 3:05:39.020]  Chen, PhD, after he reported about the coronavirus
[3:05:39.020 --> 3:05:40.780]  directly from Wilhelm.
[3:05:40.780 --> 3:05:43.940]  In April 2020, Facebook censored a documentary
[3:05:43.940 --> 3:05:46.780]  from the Epoch Times that looked into whether
[3:05:46.780 --> 3:05:49.580]  the coronavirus might have originated in a Wilhelm Lab
[3:05:49.580 --> 3:05:52.460]  after it was flagged by a fact checker.
[3:05:52.460 --> 3:05:54.180]  If you can't question the fact checkers,
[3:05:54.180 --> 3:05:58.660]  can you, they're just angelic beyond reproach
[3:05:58.660 --> 3:06:00.700]  who previously worked at the Wilhelm Lab.
[3:06:00.700 --> 3:06:03.380]  So the fact checker worked at the Wilhelm Lab
[3:06:03.380 --> 3:06:07.300]  and he's the independent impartial source, okay?
[3:06:07.300 --> 3:06:10.140]  In September 2020, Twitter permanently suspended
[3:06:10.140 --> 3:06:13.940]  Chinese virologist and whistleblower, Dr. Li Mengjie
[3:06:13.940 --> 3:06:15.700]  and Facebook censored her appearance
[3:06:15.700 --> 3:06:17.700]  on Fox NewsHouse, Tucker Colson's show
[3:06:17.700 --> 3:06:22.260]  after she claimed that COVID-19 was created in the Wilhelm Lab.
[3:06:23.540 --> 3:06:26.500]  Some of the many examples of those who have been censored
[3:06:26.500 --> 3:06:29.500]  by Big Tech for discussing the same Wilhelm Lab leak
[3:06:29.500 --> 3:06:33.420]  the mainstream media is now covering more than a year later.
[3:06:34.420 --> 3:06:35.900]  We have this headline yesterday
[3:06:35.900 --> 3:06:37.660]  or a few days ago, in fact,
[3:06:37.660 --> 3:06:41.300]  it's a fact forced to pull fact check that debunked
[3:06:41.300 --> 3:06:44.860]  or they debunked it, Lab leak origin of COVID.
[3:06:46.060 --> 3:06:48.860]  And again, they said it was basically impossible
[3:06:48.860 --> 3:06:50.460]  that it would have leaked from the lab.
[3:06:50.460 --> 3:06:54.340]  They stealth edited an article from March 2020
[3:06:55.340 --> 3:06:57.540]  without telling anyone.
[3:06:57.540 --> 3:07:00.660]  And then only last night, did they come out.
[3:07:00.660 --> 3:07:03.580]  In fact, that was Vox that did that, political fact,
[3:07:03.580 --> 3:07:05.660]  I mean, give them credit, they admitted to it.
[3:07:05.660 --> 3:07:07.860]  But then Vox did the same thing, basically,
[3:07:07.860 --> 3:07:10.660]  they published an article in March 2020
[3:07:11.660 --> 3:07:14.660]  saying that there was no possibility it leaked from the lab.
[3:07:14.660 --> 3:07:17.620]  They started stealthily editing their articles
[3:07:17.620 --> 3:07:20.500]  to change the language, so it wasn't definitive
[3:07:20.500 --> 3:07:22.700]  that they say it never came from the lab.
[3:07:22.700 --> 3:07:24.700]  And only last night, did they then admit
[3:07:24.700 --> 3:07:26.340]  that they were stealth editing
[3:07:26.340 --> 3:07:30.340]  their own articles, no editorial, no, at the time.
[3:07:30.340 --> 3:07:32.340]  And they came out with a tweet which said,
[3:07:32.340 --> 3:07:34.340]  clarification, since this piece was originally published,
[3:07:34.340 --> 3:07:36.340]  scientific consensus has shifted.
[3:07:36.340 --> 3:07:38.340]  As many people have pointed out,
[3:07:38.340 --> 3:07:40.340]  the scientific consensus never shifted.
[3:07:40.340 --> 3:07:42.340]  Prominent scientists were saying this was a possibility.
[3:07:42.340 --> 3:07:45.340]  It was the media consensus that never shifted.
[3:07:45.340 --> 3:07:47.340]  They've been proven wrong once again.
[3:07:47.340 --> 3:07:49.340]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[3:07:50.340 --> 3:07:52.340]  One of the most popular memes on the internet
[3:07:52.340 --> 3:07:54.340]  in the last decade has been,
[3:07:54.340 --> 3:07:57.340]  Alex Jones was right, but it now routinely trends
[3:07:57.340 --> 3:08:01.340]  number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[3:08:01.340 --> 3:08:04.340]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[3:08:04.340 --> 3:08:06.340]  Well, let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today.
[3:08:06.340 --> 3:08:08.340]  And thanks to your support, we're still on air
[3:08:08.340 --> 3:08:10.340]  at infohorns.com and Bandai Video,
[3:08:10.340 --> 3:08:12.340]  radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[3:08:12.340 --> 3:08:15.340]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon
[3:08:15.340 --> 3:08:17.340]  when it hit number one a few years ago,
[3:08:17.340 --> 3:08:19.340]  is now available again.
[3:08:19.340 --> 3:08:21.340]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD in HD.
[3:08:21.340 --> 3:08:24.340]  It has a zero country code.
[3:08:24.340 --> 3:08:26.340]  Anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it.
[3:08:26.340 --> 3:08:28.340]  And I'm asking you to get the original,
[3:08:28.340 --> 3:08:30.340]  make copies, give it to everyone you know.
[3:08:30.340 --> 3:08:32.340]  Errol O'Blash's TV, give it to your pastors,
[3:08:32.340 --> 3:08:34.340]  your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers,
[3:08:34.340 --> 3:08:36.340]  whatever you do, warn the world.
[3:08:36.340 --> 3:08:38.340]  This film uses their own documents and own statements
[3:08:38.340 --> 3:08:40.340]  14 years ago to expose them.
[3:08:40.340 --> 3:08:42.340]  It's more important than ever.
[3:08:42.340 --> 3:08:44.340]  Available at infohorns.com.
[3:08:44.340 --> 3:08:45.340]  That's infohorns.com.
[3:08:45.340 --> 3:08:47.340]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:08:47.340 --> 3:08:52.340]  I share with you the viewers and listeners
[3:08:52.340 --> 3:08:54.340]  the facts of where infohorns is.
[3:08:54.340 --> 3:08:56.340]  And it's always a complex picture,
[3:08:56.340 --> 3:08:58.340]  but I do my best to explain it to you because
[3:08:58.340 --> 3:09:01.340]  you are the patrons that make all this possible.
[3:09:01.340 --> 3:09:03.340]  So in short, the world's awakening,
[3:09:03.340 --> 3:09:05.340]  the spiral of censorship, infohorns,
[3:09:05.340 --> 3:09:07.340]  has never been more influential
[3:09:07.340 --> 3:09:09.340]  and has never had a bigger effect
[3:09:09.340 --> 3:09:11.340]  exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[3:09:11.340 --> 3:09:14.340]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns,
[3:09:14.340 --> 3:09:16.340]  the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down
[3:09:16.340 --> 3:09:19.340]  because most of us selling products, which you want to buy,
[3:09:19.340 --> 3:09:20.340]  like DNA Force Plus and others,
[3:09:20.340 --> 3:09:22.340]  have been sold out for up to seven months.
[3:09:22.340 --> 3:09:23.340]  Well, guess what?
[3:09:23.340 --> 3:09:25.340]  DNA Force Plus just came back in,
[3:09:25.340 --> 3:09:27.340]  thank God, for seven months.
[3:09:27.340 --> 3:09:28.340]  It's 40% off.
[3:09:28.340 --> 3:09:29.340]  It's amazing.
[3:09:29.340 --> 3:09:30.340]  At infohorns.com.
[3:09:30.340 --> 3:09:32.340]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day,
[3:09:32.340 --> 3:09:35.340]  we have store-wide free shipping and double-patria points,

[3:09:46.340 --> 3:09:49.340]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, employers.
[3:09:51.340 --> 3:09:54.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:10:01.340 --> 3:10:05.340]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour
[3:10:05.340 --> 3:10:07.340]  with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:10:07.340 --> 3:10:12.340]  So a fact-checkers, the mainstream media are in the mud once again,
[3:10:12.340 --> 3:10:15.340]  having tried to lobby and pressure social media networks
[3:10:15.340 --> 3:10:17.340]  to great success, by the way,
[3:10:17.340 --> 3:10:19.340]  as I documented in the previous segment,
[3:10:19.340 --> 3:10:21.340]  to silence information, to ban people,
[3:10:21.340 --> 3:10:25.340]  for mainly suggesting that the coronavirus was leaked
[3:10:25.340 --> 3:10:28.340]  either deliberately or accidentally from the Wuhan lab.
[3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:31.340]  They did that for the best part of a year.
[3:10:31.340 --> 3:10:33.340]  Even prominent organizations,
[3:10:33.340 --> 3:10:37.340]  like Zero-Hedge, for example, also got banned off of Twitter.
[3:10:37.340 --> 3:10:39.340]  They got back on later on,
[3:10:39.340 --> 3:10:43.340]  simply for making this point for stating the evidence.
[3:10:43.340 --> 3:10:45.340]  And it all comes back to the question
[3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:49.340]  of why we're giving fact-checkers social media networks
[3:10:49.340 --> 3:10:53.340]  and mainstream media outlets the power to define
[3:10:53.340 --> 3:10:56.340]  what constitutes misinformation,
[3:10:56.340 --> 3:10:58.340]  when in this case, by the way,
[3:10:58.340 --> 3:11:00.340]  all these same things are happening
[3:11:00.340 --> 3:11:03.340]  in this case, by the way, all these same people,
[3:11:03.340 --> 3:11:06.340]  these same organizations, CNN New York Times,
[3:11:06.340 --> 3:11:10.340]  were the same people saying that weapons of mass destruction
[3:11:10.340 --> 3:11:14.340]  were in Iraq, creating, greasing the skids for that horror,
[3:11:14.340 --> 3:11:18.340]  the endless horror which still has consequences to this day
[3:11:18.340 --> 3:11:20.340]  with this whole migrant wave
[3:11:20.340 --> 3:11:23.340]  due to the destabilization of the Middle East.
[3:11:23.340 --> 3:11:26.340]  They've proven themselves to be completely untrustworthy
[3:11:26.340 --> 3:11:28.340]  for literally decades.
[3:11:28.340 --> 3:11:32.340]  And these are the same entities declaring what's a conspiracy theory,
[3:11:32.340 --> 3:11:34.340]  declaring what's misinformation,
[3:11:34.340 --> 3:11:36.340]  declaring what you're allowed to talk about
[3:11:36.340 --> 3:11:41.340]  without being banned, censored, silenced, ostracized, publicly shamed,
[3:11:41.340 --> 3:11:46.340]  doxxed in some cases as we saw with CNN during the Trump presidency.
[3:11:46.340 --> 3:11:50.340]  Michael Tracy commented on this, as did a few others.
[3:11:50.340 --> 3:11:54.340]  He said, perhaps it's a bad idea to appoint tech officials
[3:11:54.340 --> 3:11:57.340]  the arbiters of what constitutes a conspiracy theory
[3:11:57.340 --> 3:12:00.340]  or disinformation and demand that they execute
[3:12:00.340 --> 3:12:04.340]  social media purges on that basis.
[3:12:04.340 --> 3:12:07.340]  Toby Young added, his perspective, he said,
[3:12:07.340 --> 3:12:10.340]  a year ago, lab leak theory was dismissed as misinformation
[3:12:10.340 --> 3:12:13.340]  by Facebook's independent fact-checkers,
[3:12:13.340 --> 3:12:16.340]  mainly because Trump was talking about it
[3:12:16.340 --> 3:12:18.340]  and post-mentioning it were removed.
[3:12:18.340 --> 3:12:23.340]  Now even Dr. Fauci, oh my God, even Dr. Fauci's saying it,
[3:12:23.340 --> 3:12:27.340]  the esteemed angelic presence.
[3:12:27.340 --> 3:12:30.340]  Now even Dr. Fauci is saying it should be investigated.
[3:12:30.340 --> 3:12:32.340]  A good example of why big tech companies
[3:12:32.340 --> 3:12:35.340]  should not try to censor misinformation.
[3:12:35.340 --> 3:12:37.340]  Of course, they're not going to listen.
[3:12:37.340 --> 3:12:39.340]  They don't care because they're malevolent entities
[3:12:39.340 --> 3:12:41.340]  that hate the truth.
[3:12:41.340 --> 3:12:44.340]  And they want to silence people to tell the truth.
[3:12:44.340 --> 3:12:47.340]  So they're never going to be like, oh, yeah, mea culpa.
[3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:49.340]  We got it wrong. Maybe we shouldn't have that power.
[3:12:49.340 --> 3:12:51.340]  They're never going to give up that power.
[3:12:51.340 --> 3:12:54.340]  Stephen Crowder said, so now that mainstream outlets
[3:12:54.340 --> 3:12:57.340]  are admitting the likelihood of COVID originating in a lab,
[3:12:57.340 --> 3:13:00.340]  after mocking Trump mercilessly over his claims for a year,
[3:13:00.340 --> 3:13:02.340]  let me ask you this.
[3:13:02.340 --> 3:13:05.340]  He said, if this info were available, I would say last year,
[3:13:05.340 --> 3:13:09.340]  think it may have had an impact on the election.
[3:13:09.340 --> 3:13:13.340]  Well, I wonder, of course, those same powerful entities
[3:13:13.340 --> 3:13:16.340]  wielded complete control over what you could say about the election
[3:13:16.340 --> 3:13:21.340]  in its aftermath so nobody could seriously investigate claims
[3:13:21.340 --> 3:13:25.340]  of fraud because that would mean instant social banning,
[3:13:25.340 --> 3:13:29.340]  instant public shaming, instant ostracization.
[3:13:29.340 --> 3:13:31.340]  So they've been caught red-handed.
[3:13:31.340 --> 3:13:33.340]  They're not going to change their tactics, though.
[3:13:33.340 --> 3:13:35.340]  They're not going to change their approach to how they define
[3:13:35.340 --> 3:13:37.340]  misinformation.
[3:13:37.340 --> 3:13:41.340]  But even some people within the system are now calling them out.
[3:13:41.340 --> 3:13:44.340]  Headline former New York Times science editor slams media
[3:13:44.340 --> 3:13:47.340]  over dismissal of COVID lab origin.
[3:13:47.340 --> 3:13:50.340]  This is former New York Times science editor, Nicholas Wade,
[3:13:50.340 --> 3:13:53.340]  who slammed the mainstream media for its early attempts
[3:13:53.340 --> 3:13:56.340]  to amplify Chinese propaganda by dismissing the lab leak origin
[3:13:56.340 --> 3:13:59.340]  of COVID as a conspiracy theory.
[3:13:59.340 --> 3:14:02.340]  According to Wade, the US media was complicit in a, quote,
[3:14:02.340 --> 3:14:06.340]  sustained Chinese propaganda effort because of its failure
[3:14:06.340 --> 3:14:10.340]  to take off its political glasses and look at the cold hard facts.
[3:14:10.340 --> 3:14:13.340]  He said, quote, but you know it's more than that.
[3:14:13.340 --> 3:14:16.340]  It was just the blindness, if I could put it that way, of our media.
[3:14:16.340 --> 3:14:19.340]  And he's, like, cutting them too much slack here.
[3:14:19.340 --> 3:14:22.340]  So, oh, they just didn't investigate it fully enough.
[3:14:22.340 --> 3:14:24.340]  Come on, then, you.
[3:14:24.340 --> 3:14:26.340]  He said, we're too polarized to see scientific issues
[3:14:26.340 --> 3:14:29.340]  for their own sake without putting a political gloss on them.
[3:14:29.340 --> 3:14:30.340]  We don't know for sure.
[3:14:30.340 --> 3:14:32.340]  The origin of the virus is just we've got these two possible
[3:14:32.340 --> 3:14:33.340]  scenarios.
[3:14:33.340 --> 3:14:35.340]  But if you look at all the evidence and ask yourself,
[3:14:35.340 --> 3:14:37.340]  well, which scenario explains all these facts better
[3:14:37.340 --> 3:14:40.340]  on present evidence, it seems to me, at least,
[3:14:40.340 --> 3:14:44.340]  that the lab escape hypothesis explains it a lot better.
[3:14:44.340 --> 3:14:47.340]  So that's the former New York Times science editor,
[3:14:47.340 --> 3:14:50.340]  another dangerous conspiracy theorist basically saying
[3:14:50.340 --> 3:14:52.340]  it's likely it came from the lab.
[3:14:52.340 --> 3:14:56.340]  Meanwhile, the Washington Post journalist forced to eat crow
[3:14:56.340 --> 3:14:58.340]  over Wuhan lab leak theory.
[3:14:58.340 --> 3:15:02.340]  This is Glenn Kessler, who is facing ridicule after reporting
[3:15:02.340 --> 3:15:05.340]  that the lab leak origin of COVID is now credible.
[3:15:05.340 --> 3:15:08.340]  That's his own word, credible, after previously having attacked
[3:15:08.340 --> 3:15:12.340]  Senator Ted Cruz for saying the same thing.
[3:15:12.340 --> 3:15:15.340]  So back in May 2020, around a year ago,
[3:15:15.340 --> 3:15:18.340]  Cruz responded to Kessler's assertion that the lab leak
[3:15:18.340 --> 3:15:22.340]  theory was doubtful by accusing the news outlet of abandoning
[3:15:22.340 --> 3:15:27.340]  all pretenses of journalism to produce CCP propaganda.
[3:15:27.340 --> 3:15:30.340]  Kessler responded by accusing Cruz of missing the scientific
[3:15:30.340 --> 3:15:33.340]  animation in the video that shows how it's virtually impossible
[3:15:33.340 --> 3:15:36.340]  for the virus to jump from the lab, or the many interviews
[3:15:36.340 --> 3:15:40.340]  of actual scientists, yeah, the ones who work at the lab,
[3:15:40.340 --> 3:15:42.340]  such an impartial source.
[3:15:42.340 --> 3:15:46.340]  He said, we deal in facts and viewers can judge for themselves.
[3:15:46.340 --> 3:15:52.340]  Well, now that same individual, Mr. Kessler has tweeted,
[3:15:52.340 --> 3:15:56.340]  I think he wrote the actual article for the Washington Post,
[3:15:56.340 --> 3:15:59.340]  got ratioed on Twitter as a result of that,
[3:15:59.340 --> 3:16:04.340]  and he now admits that the lab leak origin has suddenly become credible.
[3:16:04.340 --> 3:16:08.340]  The same guy that was trying to own Ted Cruz on Twitter a year ago
[3:16:08.340 --> 3:16:12.340]  for saying the exact same thing, now admits that he basically
[3:16:12.340 --> 3:16:14.340]  agrees with Ted Cruz.
[3:16:14.340 --> 3:16:17.340]  Donald Trump Jr. responded to this by saying it didn't suddenly
[3:16:17.340 --> 3:16:18.340]  become credible.
[3:16:18.340 --> 3:16:19.340]  It was always credible.
[3:16:19.340 --> 3:16:24.340]  It literally always made the most sense, made a lot of sense
[3:16:24.340 --> 3:16:28.340]  in terms of how it impacts the Trump's election chances.
[3:16:28.340 --> 3:16:30.340]  Oh, but they'd never release it deliberately.
[3:16:30.340 --> 3:16:35.340]  He went on to say, I understand the desired narrative media always wanted,
[3:16:35.340 --> 3:16:37.340]  but didn't anyone think the most likely scenario was the virus
[3:16:37.340 --> 3:16:41.340]  magically originated feet from the lab that worked with it?
[3:16:41.340 --> 3:16:45.340]  What a silly conspiracy theory.
[3:16:45.340 --> 3:16:49.340]  So you have New York Times former science editors coming out
[3:16:49.340 --> 3:16:51.340]  and saying that the media got it completely wrong.
[3:16:51.340 --> 3:16:55.340]  You have the Washington Post journalist being dinged,
[3:16:55.340 --> 3:16:59.340]  being owned on Twitter for attacking Ted Cruz,
[3:16:59.340 --> 3:17:01.340]  saying that now, saying that it's a credible thing,
[3:17:01.340 --> 3:17:03.340]  that it probably did come from the lab.
[3:17:03.340 --> 3:17:07.340]  As I mentioned before the break, Vox and several other left-wing
[3:17:07.340 --> 3:17:11.340]  news outlets have been secretly editing their old articles
[3:17:11.340 --> 3:17:16.340]  which say, oh, the lab leak theory is being completely debunked.
[3:17:16.340 --> 3:17:17.340]  How could anyone even suggest it?
[3:17:17.340 --> 3:17:19.340]  They're changing words.
[3:17:19.340 --> 3:17:22.340]  They're changing language within those articles without putting
[3:17:22.340 --> 3:17:26.340]  an editorial note on it until last night when people start pointing
[3:17:26.340 --> 3:17:31.340]  it out again to cover their own behind.
[3:17:31.340 --> 3:17:34.340]  The UK government has come out today and said it wants all possible
[3:17:34.340 --> 3:17:38.340]  theories explored on origin of COVID.
[3:17:38.340 --> 3:17:41.340]  This was Boris Johnson's official spokesman who said the investigation
[3:17:41.340 --> 3:17:44.340]  needs to explore all possible theories on how COVID-19
[3:17:44.340 --> 3:17:47.340]  made that jump from animals to humans.
[3:17:47.340 --> 3:17:50.340]  So you got Fauci, you got the ex-CDC director under Trump.
[3:17:50.340 --> 3:17:52.340]  You got the current CDC director under Trump.
[3:17:52.340 --> 3:17:55.340]  You had that panel of scientific experts a couple of weeks ago
[3:17:55.340 --> 3:17:58.340]  who said it almost certainly came from the lab.
[3:17:58.340 --> 3:18:01.340]  Fauci himself is now saying it comes from the lab,
[3:18:01.340 --> 3:18:04.340]  or at least that that was a possibility.
[3:18:04.340 --> 3:18:06.340]  And what's the result?
[3:18:06.340 --> 3:18:09.340]  Biden White House refuses to investigate COVID origin,
[3:18:09.340 --> 3:18:12.340]  once academics or Americans off lab leak theory,
[3:18:12.340 --> 3:18:15.340]  the press secretary, Pesachy, was asked if it was going to be
[3:18:15.340 --> 3:18:19.340]  investigated and basically said, oh, we're just going to leave it
[3:18:19.340 --> 3:18:22.340]  to the international process.
[3:18:22.340 --> 3:18:25.340]  Well, the international process already tried to investigate it.
[3:18:25.340 --> 3:18:27.340]  I use the word tried.
[3:18:27.340 --> 3:18:30.340]  Pretended is a more operative word.
[3:18:30.340 --> 3:18:33.340]  When a group of WHO individuals visited the Wuhan Institute
[3:18:33.340 --> 3:18:36.340]  of Virology, turned up for a few hours,
[3:18:36.340 --> 3:18:39.340]  asked the actual researchers if they leaked the virus,
[3:18:39.340 --> 3:18:42.340]  were told, no, we didn't, and then went home
[3:18:42.340 --> 3:18:44.340]  to their own respective countries.
[3:18:44.340 --> 3:18:46.340]  What a thorough investigation that was.
[3:18:46.340 --> 3:18:49.340]  Don't go away, we'll be right back to some of the news.
[3:18:49.340 --> 3:18:52.340]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me,
[3:18:52.340 --> 3:18:55.340]  and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there
[3:18:55.340 --> 3:18:58.340]  and I beg you for support, constantly,
[3:18:58.340 --> 3:19:01.340]  for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth,
[3:19:01.340 --> 3:19:03.340]  and then we're all in this together.
[3:19:03.340 --> 3:19:06.340]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey,
[3:19:06.340 --> 3:19:08.340]  I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:19:08.340 --> 3:19:11.340]  But it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States
[3:19:11.340 --> 3:19:14.340]  that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden
[3:19:14.340 --> 3:19:16.340]  to big corporate sponsors.
[3:19:16.340 --> 3:19:18.340]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:19:18.340 --> 3:19:20.340]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[3:19:20.340 --> 3:19:22.340]  And we're still here, and as this whole new world order
[3:19:22.340 --> 3:19:25.340]  comes out in the open, our credibility's going up.
[3:19:25.340 --> 3:19:27.340]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:19:27.340 --> 3:19:29.340]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:19:29.340 --> 3:19:31.340]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved,
[3:19:31.340 --> 3:19:33.340]  and America's still quasi-free.
[3:19:33.340 --> 3:19:35.340]  You can't have info wars that's been proven right,
[3:19:35.340 --> 3:19:38.340]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:19:38.340 --> 3:19:40.340]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:19:40.340 --> 3:19:43.340]  So thank you all, and get an infowarstore.com,
[3:19:43.340 --> 3:19:45.340]  get some great 2020 election shirts,

[3:21:22.780 --> 3:21:26.220]  with top developers to blow people away, and it's all there.
[3:21:26.220 --> 3:21:34.100]  There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales and specials to mention them all here today.

[3:21:50.020 --> 3:21:56.300]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold out for three months, four months, six months, seven months,
[3:21:56.300 --> 3:21:58.260]  it's not a gimmick to make you buy the products.
[3:21:58.260 --> 3:22:05.860]  I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation
[3:22:05.860 --> 3:22:09.500]  because they're great products that we're coming back and getting more, and thank you for the support.
[3:22:09.500 --> 3:22:16.780]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's Polym Block or whether it's SuperMoviality or VasoBeats,
[3:22:16.780 --> 3:22:23.420]  because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower the quality of our products, and so we just can't offer them.
[3:22:23.420 --> 3:22:31.500]  But thank God it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now because suddenly a lot of products have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[3:22:31.500 --> 3:22:34.060]  And one of them is Polym Block.
[3:22:34.060 --> 3:22:38.900]  It takes a long time to get into Polym Block, but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like allergies.
[3:22:38.900 --> 3:22:40.460]  It's from France.
[3:22:40.460 --> 3:22:42.500]  It's a special proprietary system.
[3:22:42.500 --> 3:22:48.460]  This is the highest quality back in stock, infoorestore.com, store-wide free shipping, and double Patriot points.
[3:22:48.460 --> 3:22:53.460]  Check it out.
[3:22:53.460 --> 3:22:57.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:22:57.460 --> 3:23:14.460]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:23:14.460 --> 3:23:21.460]  I'm going to touch on what happened a few hours ago in George Floyd Square in Minneapolis with the shooting there.
[3:23:21.460 --> 3:23:25.460]  But first, a related story we had this headline up earlier today.
[3:23:25.460 --> 3:23:31.460]  Authorities say Black Lives Matter activists were shot in the head by four black men.
[3:23:31.460 --> 3:23:39.460]  This was a leading Black Lives Matter activist in the UK who went to a house party evidently on Saturday night.
[3:23:39.460 --> 3:23:45.460]  3 a.m. on the next morning, Sunday morning, was shot in the head by a gang of four black men.
[3:23:45.460 --> 3:23:47.460]  Authorities have now revealed.
[3:23:47.460 --> 3:23:57.460]  Sasha Johnson, who is one of the most militant, extreme Black Lives Matter activists in the UK, was left critically ill after the four men dressed in dark clothing,
[3:23:57.460 --> 3:24:04.460]  entered the garden at the property and discharged a firearm, according to the Metropolitan Police.
[3:24:04.460 --> 3:24:14.460]  Now, this is interesting because as soon as the shooting happened in the hours following, BLM activists tried to suggest that the shooting may have been a targeted attack
[3:24:14.460 --> 3:24:18.460]  asserting that Johnson had received death threats prior to the incident.
[3:24:18.460 --> 3:24:27.460]  So they were obviously trying to paint the narrative that this was some kind of white supremacist revenge attack against this BLM activist.
[3:24:27.460 --> 3:24:35.460]  However, police say there is no evidence Johnson was deliberately targeted and her friend Imam Aiton told the BBC quote,
[3:24:35.460 --> 3:24:40.460]  the incident is more related to rival gangs as opposed to her activism.
[3:24:40.460 --> 3:24:48.460]  So basically what happened is from the sounds of it, she was at a house party with some gang members in South London,
[3:24:48.460 --> 3:24:57.460]  in an S-hole area of South London called Peckham, and she was caught up in this what seemed like a gangland shooting,
[3:24:57.460 --> 3:25:00.460]  not deliberately targeted herself.
[3:25:00.460 --> 3:25:08.460]  And yet these activists still continue to claim, even right now they're still claiming it and even CNN is refusing to report on this,
[3:25:08.460 --> 3:25:13.460]  which I'm going to get on to, that it was potentially a targeted assassination attempt.
[3:25:13.460 --> 3:25:20.460]  During a vigil for Johnson on Monday afternoon, BLM supporters were still erroneously blaming other entities for her shooting,
[3:25:20.460 --> 3:25:28.460]  with one speaker asserting quote, I want to say to some of the media here, you guys caused some of this SHIT.
[3:25:28.460 --> 3:25:35.460]  Another speaker seemed more concerned about quote, white supremacist media controlling the narrative of the story stating,
[3:25:35.460 --> 3:25:41.460]  don't give them a story, don't give them a narrative, don't give them anything until they give us something.
[3:25:41.460 --> 3:25:48.460]  Now we had a Labour MP, again with no knowledge of who was responsible for the attack.
[3:25:48.460 --> 3:25:58.460]  And in fact, now that I look at this article, it seems like she's deleted the tweet, what a surprise after she was called out by everyone on Twitter,
[3:25:58.460 --> 3:26:07.460]  but we have the quote from Labour MP Diane Abbott, who suggested with absolutely no evidence that Johnson had been targeted for her activism,
[3:26:07.460 --> 3:26:16.460]  tweeting quote, nobody should have to pay, nobody should have to potentially pay with their life because they stood up for racial justice.
[3:26:16.460 --> 3:26:19.460]  She then used the hashtag, Black Lives Matter.
[3:26:19.460 --> 3:26:26.460]  Now let me just check if she's actually deleted that tweet because, no, it's still there, it's still there.
[3:26:26.460 --> 3:26:31.460]  She's that shameless, she's that shameless, she's not even going to delete it.
[3:26:31.460 --> 3:26:38.460]  So we have a top Labour MP, Diane Abbott, in the hours after this tragic attack,
[3:26:38.460 --> 3:26:45.460]  saying that it was basically a political payback, a revenge attack by white supremacists, at least suggesting that that was the premise.
[3:26:45.460 --> 3:26:54.460]  The actual reality of the incident was that this Black Lives Matter activist was shot in the head by four black criminal men.
[3:26:54.460 --> 3:27:08.460]  Once again, highlighting the point that why does Black Lives Matter not care about black lives when they're taken by other black people in every single instance.
[3:27:08.460 --> 3:27:16.460]  In fact, I remember a story that we covered last year where there was a George Floyd Black Lives Matter rally in America, I forget the city,
[3:27:16.460 --> 3:27:28.460]  potentially it was in Minnesota, Minneapolis, where a young girl, a child was literally shot in the head at a Black Lives Matter rally.
[3:27:28.460 --> 3:27:33.460]  It was swept under the carpet very quickly, nobody seemed to care about that black life.
[3:27:33.460 --> 3:27:41.460]  Just as nobody seems to care about black lives in London, where this tragic incident happened, as we've highlighted before,
[3:27:41.460 --> 3:27:53.460]  statistics reported in the evening standard from the actual police stand that 73% of offenders and 53% of victims of knife crime,
[3:27:53.460 --> 3:28:00.460]  because of course most of the murders in London on knife crime rather than gun crime, were of a black or minority ethnic background
[3:28:00.460 --> 3:28:05.460]  and that two thirds of all knife crime in the capital was carried out by people under 25.
[3:28:05.460 --> 3:28:15.460]  Now the biggest culprit in terms of taking black lives or at least ethnic minority lives in the capital city or other ethnic minorities and black people,
[3:28:15.460 --> 3:28:21.460]  that's not really an issue that I see Black Lives Matter really focus on to any significant degree.
[3:28:21.460 --> 3:28:32.460]  Of course we know the figures out of Chicago, big American cities in general, where 90% of black victims of gun crime, the assailants or other black people,
[3:28:32.460 --> 3:28:40.460]  you would think that would be somewhat important if you actually care about black lives, but to BLM it never is.
[3:28:40.460 --> 3:28:49.460]  Now we know from the police that this was a gangland shooting, that she was caught up in the middle of it, that the assailants were four black men,
[3:28:49.460 --> 3:28:56.460]  yet CNN even today is still refusing to report that the culprits were four black men.
[3:28:56.460 --> 3:29:03.460]  We have a headline here out of CNN, Black Lives Matter, activist and critical condition after being shot in the head in London.
[3:29:03.460 --> 3:29:10.460]  And immediately in the article they quote this political extremist party that she was associated with,
[3:29:10.460 --> 3:29:15.460]  who said that the attack happened following numerous death threats as a result of her activism.
[3:29:15.460 --> 3:29:21.460]  That is the third paragraph in the CNN article published today about the shooting,
[3:29:21.460 --> 3:29:28.460]  despite the fact we already know from the police and from Sasha Johnson's own friends, by the way,
[3:29:28.460 --> 3:29:34.460]  that it was a gangland attack and that it was four black individuals responsible for the shooting.
[3:29:34.460 --> 3:29:44.460]  Yet CNN has published an article after that information came out within the first three paragraphs suggesting it was a revenge attack, a political hit.
[3:29:44.460 --> 3:29:54.460]  Complete misinformation, complete fake news. And then they quote another friend of Johnson who said that although the facts of the shooting were still being established,
[3:29:54.460 --> 3:29:59.460]  no, they've been established, the only thing that's not being established is precisely who did it.
[3:29:59.460 --> 3:30:05.460]  They're still on the loose, but the police have said it's four black men, obviously because of the other eyewitnesses that were at the party.
[3:30:05.460 --> 3:30:11.460]  But they quote a friend of hers who said whether it was targeted or whether she was in the wrong place at the wrong time,
[3:30:11.460 --> 3:30:19.460]  the fact is nobody is spraying bullets into white communities, but it's a regular occurrence within the black community.
[3:30:19.460 --> 3:30:24.460]  Yeah, and maybe that's the point. Maybe that's the point right here.
[3:30:24.460 --> 3:30:33.460]  But CNN is refusing to report the primary truthful, crucial fact of the shooting of a black lives matter activist,
[3:30:33.460 --> 3:30:37.460]  which is that it was carried out by black people.
[3:30:37.460 --> 3:30:44.460]  Meanwhile, video news reporter talks about police reform as gunshots ring out at George Floyd Square.
[3:30:44.460 --> 3:30:54.460]  Nearest people are pointing out the chilling irony of a video which shows a news reporter talking about police reform at George Floyd Square as a criminal gunman began firing shots.
[3:30:54.460 --> 3:31:02.460]  You've probably seen the video by now shows a news reporter reporting live from the scene talking about police reform,
[3:31:02.460 --> 3:31:10.460]  because obviously police reform is the biggest problem here. Meanwhile, somebody literally shows up as a drive by shooting.
[3:31:10.460 --> 3:31:16.460]  Thankfully, it looks like nobody died. Only one person was injured from the latest reports that I read.
[3:31:16.460 --> 3:31:27.460]  But he's literally talking about the main problem in these communities being the policing while people are being shot at indiscriminately at George Floyd Square.
[3:31:27.460 --> 3:31:36.460]  And in fact, there was another segment on a different news channel, which again was talking about police reform while this was literally happening.
[3:31:36.460 --> 3:31:41.460]  Maybe the bigger problem isn't the police commented one respondent.
[3:31:41.460 --> 3:31:47.460]  Another person said is anyone surprised they don't want to reform policing. They want to be the police.
[3:31:47.460 --> 3:31:53.460]  Another person responded to this by saying better call the police away.
[3:31:53.460 --> 3:31:59.460]  And then another journalist, by the way, came out with a tweet shortly after this incident happened.
[3:31:59.460 --> 3:32:03.460]  This is Philip Crowder at Philip in DC.
[3:32:03.460 --> 3:32:14.460]  He said George Floyd Square very quiet again now again, thankfully, only one person injured, which is shocking if you watch the video because you literally hear about 1520 gunshots.
[3:32:14.460 --> 3:32:24.460]  But he said George Floyd Square very quiet again now, but a fellow reporter just had a phone smashed because she took photos of a storefront hit by a bullet.
[3:32:24.460 --> 3:32:30.460]  Now, who do you think is seizing that phone from that reporter and smashing it to the ground?
[3:32:30.460 --> 3:32:44.460]  I would hazard a guess that it's either Antifa left wing radicals or Black Lives Matter activists that don't want the media filming the aftermath of that shooting in George Floyd Square.
[3:32:44.460 --> 3:33:00.460]  I think, you know, the reason why don't go away. Summit.News will be right back.

[3:35:12.460 --> 3:35:19.460]  I could tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the info war?

[3:37:13.460 --> 3:37:29.460]  I'm going to come back and finish up with some final news stories, but we're going to go to a clip now because a few days ago May 22 marked the four year anniversary of the shocking atrocity that happened in Manchester, the Manchester arena in the United Kingdom.
[3:37:29.460 --> 3:37:44.460]  Hundreds of people, most of them children, maimed and killed by an Islamic terrorist who, by the way, was literally brought into the UK by the British Royal Navy on the refugee wave as a refugee.
[3:37:44.460 --> 3:37:56.460]  As a result of the Obama administration's disastrous destabilization of the Middle East, their tacit support for Islamic radicals in that region, which of course led to the growth of ISIS.
[3:37:56.460 --> 3:38:02.460]  He was literally brought into the country by by our government on the refugee wave went on to carry out that attack.
[3:38:02.460 --> 3:38:16.460]  Many such cases, the Paris massacre, of course, we know that the majority of the massacre terrorists were brought into the France brought into Europe again by exploiting the refugee wave to carry out that attack.
[3:38:16.460 --> 3:38:35.460]  Nigel Farage put out a video a couple of days ago about the continuing problem in the United Kingdom with our supposedly conservative and name only government continuing to bring in these boat migrants with no checks, no idea who they are putting them up in four or five star hotels at taxpayer expense,
[3:38:35.460 --> 3:38:44.460]  while claiming that they're trying to limit illegal immigration. Let's go to this Nigel Farage clip right now. Here it is.
[3:38:44.460 --> 3:38:57.460]  Well, I'm currently on tour in the USA, where one of the issues that is dominating the news is the border crisis. What is happening down on the Mexican border, about 1000 people a day coming through that border.
[3:38:57.460 --> 3:39:09.460]  And it's a subject of huge national debate. Now, those that have followed me will know that this time last year, that just before this time last year, I started going out into the English Channel to expose our own border crisis.
[3:39:09.460 --> 3:39:20.460]  And I did it because mainstream media were not covering the subject. You see, in 2018, by mid May, seven people had illegally crossed the English Channel by boat.
[3:39:20.460 --> 3:39:33.460]  In 2019, that figure was around about 450. But when I went out last year to expose this story, well, by this time last year, 1300 people had crossed the channel.
[3:39:33.460 --> 3:39:41.460]  As a result of me going out there and lots of you watching this and passing on to your friends, we actually got mainstream media to cover the story.
[3:39:41.460 --> 3:39:48.460]  Well, I bet you don't know what's going on in the English Channel right now, because mainstream media are not covering this at all.
[3:39:48.460 --> 3:39:57.460]  Let me tell you that to date, the number that have come illegally across the English Channel, at least the number we know of, is now approaching 3000.
[3:39:57.460 --> 3:40:07.460]  I said this time last year that 5000 people might come throughout 2020. I was wrong. Completely wrong. The figure was 8500.
[3:40:07.460 --> 3:40:13.460]  And I'm telling you, on the current projections this year, it is going to be 20,000 people.
[3:40:13.460 --> 3:40:19.460]  Now, you might see the odd picture in Medellin Mellor elsewhere of a five or six-year-old child that comes across.
[3:40:19.460 --> 3:40:32.460]  But being no doubt, 85% of those that come are young men. We've noticed this year a much larger number of Vietnamese people coming, but basically we haven't got a clue who these people are.
[3:40:32.460 --> 3:40:38.460]  I also covered last year where they were going. Hotels being filled up all over the country.
[3:40:38.460 --> 3:40:44.460]  Well, the government have now run out of hotels to put people in, so they're turning to private accommodation.
[3:40:44.460 --> 3:40:57.460]  I even learned today that my home village of town, where I was born and raised and where I still live, very close by, I've even heard today that in the name of social housing, we will have illegal immigrants put into our village.
[3:40:57.460 --> 3:41:08.460]  This is spreading throughout the entire country. It is costing a fortune. It poses a national security risk, given that we don't know whether some of these that are coming were perhaps fighting for ISIS a couple of years ago.
[3:41:08.460 --> 3:41:24.460]  We just simply don't know. What's the response to all of this? Well, every time I raise this issue, Pretty Patel, the Home Secretary, comes out with a big tough statement about what we're going to do, and the Queen's speech a couple of days ago was no exception to that rule.
[3:41:24.460 --> 3:41:33.460]  We're now told that anybody that comes into the UK through a safe country will not be able to claim refugee status. Fine.
[3:41:33.460 --> 3:41:43.460]  But what she hasn't said is what will happen to them. Will they be returned back to France from whence they came? We have no agreement with the French to do so.
[3:41:43.460 --> 3:41:54.460]  And what it means is nothing is going to change whatsoever. This crisis will continue. The upset to communities where all these people are put will continue.
[3:41:54.460 --> 3:42:03.460]  And I'm afraid 2021 is going to get a lot worse. So this is my first attempt to flag what is really going on this year. Have a look at some of this footage.
[3:42:03.460 --> 3:42:20.460]  And the extraordinary thing was this morning, there were beach landings taking place, boats coming all the way through, landing on the shore at Dungeon S in Kent, and yet anchored up two miles away was a Royal Naval vessel that appeared to be totally unconcerned with what I think in terms of numbers amounts to an invasion.
[3:42:20.460 --> 3:42:30.460]  No, they're far too busy boarding British fishing boats to make sure the scallops they're keeping are the right size. We've got our priorities completely and utterly wrong on this.
[3:42:30.460 --> 3:42:39.460]  There are things that Boris's government have got right. I like some of the things in the Queen's speech. I'm pleased that we've got Brexit done, even if the deal is imperfect.
[3:42:39.460 --> 3:42:51.460]  But we continue to be humiliated on our borders. And I genuinely think I really do genuinely think that there is a conspiracy of silence amongst our broadcasters who don't wish this issue to even be discussed.
[3:42:51.460 --> 3:43:09.460]  What I will promise you is while I am back in the UK from this tour of the US, I'll be back out in the English Channel on a boat and I'll get some footage and I'll make sure mainstream media have to wake up to what's going on.
[3:43:09.460 --> 3:43:21.460]  There is Nigel Farage talking about the border crisis in England, which continues to be exacerbated by our own supposedly conservative government. I'm going to move on to some final news stories now.
[3:43:21.460 --> 3:43:32.460]  Governor Whitmer has become the latest authority figure to flagrantly violate her own COVID rules, just the latest in again many such cases.
[3:43:32.460 --> 3:43:44.460]  And she's been forced to apologize for breaking rules on indoor dining. Whitmer was photographed with a dozen people at a bar in East Lansing violating rules which state a maximum of six people can be seated at a table.
[3:43:44.460 --> 3:43:56.460]  By the way, she was partly responsible for passing that rule the week before she barely even waited a week before violating her own rule.
[3:43:56.460 --> 3:44:11.460]  And she came out with some mealy mouth apology afterwards. As I highlight in the article, this is just the latest of the plethora of examples of those who make the rules, demand everyone else completely, everyone else comply while flagrantly violating them themselves.
[3:44:11.460 --> 3:44:30.460]  Her own two aides back in April went for a spring break vacation, even as residents were cautioned against traveling due to a rise in COVID cases, because we had John Kerry getting on the flight immediately removing his mask against much of wanted CDC mandates while on a first class flight from Boston to DC.
[3:44:30.460 --> 3:44:49.460]  Joe Biden violated his own executive order on the date was signed when his family took part in a photo op on federal property after removing their masks. Then of course he had California Governor Gavin Newsom exposed when he was caught on camera unmasked eating indoors at a Michelin store restaurant with a group of 12 people,
[3:44:49.460 --> 3:45:04.460]  while simultaneously telling Californians they could only celebrate Thanksgiving outside. Almost like these people know something about the deadly threat of the virus or lack thereof that they're not telling their own people.
[3:45:04.460 --> 3:45:22.460]  Meanwhile UK Health Secretary suggests critics of vaccine passports are crazies. Of course we had for the past six months or so the UK government vowing promising that vaccine passports would not be introduced domestically for domestic events within the country that there wouldn't be an internal
[3:45:22.460 --> 3:45:38.460]  passport while literally funding corporations to create that very same passport while secretly planning that precise thing while they were telling the public the opposite. Well now UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been the face of the coronavirus response in the UK
[3:45:38.460 --> 3:45:53.460]  so he suggested critics of the vaccine passport were crazies after he retweeted a post which disparaged those who have security and privacy concerns about the program. So he basically retweeted somebody who said okay ignore the crazies.
[3:45:53.460 --> 3:46:08.460]  He's suggesting that anyone who had concerns about this was crazy. The only people who were again called crazy at the time with those who saying that this was being introduced the government was secretly planning it they called those people conspiracy theorists turns out.
[3:46:08.460 --> 3:46:24.460]  Imagine my shot the conspiracy theorists were right once again we know the ultimate gender of the vaccine passport it's the entree for the Chinese communist style social credit score where your every behavior interaction either with your own friends or with the government itself is
[3:46:24.460 --> 3:46:40.460]  tracked logged and then you're punished in the aftermath if there's any kind of infraction. Meanwhile report devastating cancer crisis has been caused by a stay at home orders leading cancer charities in the UK warning that there's a crisis underway with huge
[3:46:40.460 --> 3:46:57.460]  numbers of people not receiving referrals or treatment because they've been told to stay at home and to not burden the national health service even to this day that still continues to happen. Despite for example today the UK according 15 coronavirus deaths people are still
[3:46:57.460 --> 3:47:09.460]  afraid to go into the hospitals because of course that's one of the main vectors of catching the virus itself. They're not getting treatment they're dying. The media barely reports on it nobody cares about them.
[3:47:09.460 --> 3:47:26.460]  Then Paul responds to vile death threat package of white powder sent to his home. Of course this came after the media left wing journalists laughed and go forward and said that they were glad that his neighbor previously attacked him remember he had to have part of his lung removed.
[3:47:26.460 --> 3:47:35.460]  That set the environment for these vicious personal attacks death threats to be made against friend Paul and now somebody literally sent wine.
[3:47:35.460 --> 3:47:40.460]  That's going to wrap it up summit on a news ballroom next. We'll be back.
