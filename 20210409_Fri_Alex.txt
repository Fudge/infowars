[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  The fact is, is that we're on a good path at the border under the leadership of Joe Biden,
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.000]  President Biden. There is, it's about three things. It's about restructuring how we do
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  what is happening there because we are in a very bad situation under the Trump administration.
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.000]  Earlier today, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Texas Department
[00:47.000 --> 00:56.000]  of Family and Protective Services separately received tips that allege child abuse and
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  right at the federal government's child and migrant facility at the Freeman Coliseum and
[01:02.000 --> 01:10.000]  San Antonio behind me. These problems are a byproduct of President Biden's open border policies.
[01:10.000 --> 01:31.000]  Why should you be alarmed about the crisis on the United States southern border? Well,
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  because history is repeating itself on purpose. Yesterday, we watched literally hundreds of
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  illegal migrants crossing the border and turning themselves into the border patrol. Groups in the
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  company of children who were under seven had their basic biometric information taken down
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  and then dispatched to bus stations to continue into the United States. We are in a battle for
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  the very definition of who we are as a nation. Who are we? That is the question that our culture,
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  our nation right now is asking and people need to begin to rise up and begin to speak out
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  and push back against the lunacy and the ill logic that is being used right now to divide us.
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  The United States looks just like ancient Rome did in its final days. Of course, Rome didn't fall
[02:19.000 --> 02:26.000]  in a day, but when it finally received its death blow in 476 AD, its world power status had
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  declined due to several corrosive reasons. Germanic tribes had beaten Roman forces into
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  submission as Rome had overextended its military and its defense budget. Government corruption
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  had reached epic proportions and slave labor dried up, forcing the complacent, unskilled
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  Romans to fend for themselves. Sound familiar? Not many of us say to our sons and daughters,
[02:51.000 --> 02:58.000]  I'm hoping the day will come when you decide to go and pick fruit for a living. Hardly ever hear that.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  One of the most often made arguments with regard to immigration is that they only do jobs that
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  Americans don't want. But in the recent announces, we actually looked at all 474 occupations as
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  defined by the Department of Commerce and found that there were only six that were majority
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  immigrant, and those jobs only account for about one percent of the U.S. workforce.
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  But the final knife in Rome's back was that it lost its identity. Most importantly, Rome
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  allowed the barbarian hordes to settle within its borders, which eventually led to an uprising
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  putting an end to the identity of a thousand-year-old world power civilization.
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000]  Fast forward to 2021, and the United Nations has already decided for every citizen in the
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  United States that over the next 50 years, you will need to be replaced by a foreign population.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  As you know, the Secretary General has been concerned about this for a long time, and I'm very
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  pleased that he's lost this program against xenophobia. If all of the migrants recently
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  arrived, migrants in New York City were to form a city, they'd probably be the third or fourth
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  in the United States.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  As it reads from the United Nations own website on replacement migration, United Nations projections
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  indicate that over the next 50 years, the populations of virtually all countries will
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  face population decline and population aging. The report considers...
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  John Bowne normally does five-minute reports. His latest is about eight minutes long. It
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  is excellent. It's at Bandod video. Just click on the John Bowne section by clicking the left
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  hand corner and finding his page. The U.S. is following like Rome. It is, again, hosted
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  at Bandod video, but you can't share that link. It's blocked by the enemy everywhere, so share
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  this link. Bandthis.tv is the current link that's working getting through enemy defenses.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  Bandthis.tv. OK, we'll come back with the biggest news ever. Prepare yourselves for the mother
[04:51.000 --> 05:01.000]  load. I'm Alex Jones. It is Friday, April 9th, 2021.
[05:21.000 --> 05:36.000]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[05:36.000 --> 06:00.000]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[06:00.000 --> 06:15.000]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm Alex Jones.
[06:15.000 --> 06:35.000]  Tomorrow's news today. My fellow Americans, my fellow humans, my fellow humanity. Everything
[06:35.000 --> 06:43.000]  is coming into crystal clear focus now. The New World Order's designed for us. Their long
[06:43.000 --> 06:53.000]  planned war has now gone hot. It's Friday, April 9th, 2021. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  We'll be here for the next four hours. And then the War Room with Alan Schreuer.
[06:58.000 --> 07:05.000]  Weekday mornings, of course. Harrison Smith does a great job with American Eternal. And
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  it's become customary that I come in every Saturday and do a two to three hour commercial
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  free podcast style. Transmission has become very, very popular. We shot one that is of
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  the greatest import last Saturday that General Flynn then endorsed and said it's extremely
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  important to go watch former head of defense intelligence, former National Security Advisor
[07:25.000 --> 07:33.000]  for the president. And in that we lay out the spars pandemic battle plan war game that
[07:33.000 --> 07:43.000]  is actually live right now. There it is with millions and millions of views on Bandai video.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  It needs 100 billion views and our problems will be over very, very quickly. But I want
[07:49.000 --> 07:57.000]  to just say great job to everyone out there spreading the word. And I'm going to do another
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  special transmission tomorrow that is going to deal with official globalist documents where
[08:04.000 --> 08:11.000]  they lay out plans to put cancer viruses in the vaccines to not just kill you. But like
[08:11.000 --> 08:20.000]  every science fiction comic book movie you see, how do people become superheroes? They fall
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  in toxic waste or they get bit by a spider that's radioactive or they get a deadly vaccine
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  and they mutate and turn into a superhuman. Most people won't turn into superhumans,
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  they'll die. But out of this mass manipulation, this mass mutation program, they know that
[08:38.000 --> 08:45.000]  they get some really bizarre mutations. In cows, in pigs, in rats, in guinea pigs, in
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  sheep. And they've also now done it in China to humans. And so this is a mass experiment
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  on us to cause mass mutations that can then be studied by the globalist to get life extension
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  technologies to find the Lazarus gene to find the immortal cell lines. Those are all real
[09:01.000 --> 09:10.000]  things I just mentioned. An immortal cell line are cells that never die. And they discovered
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  them. They're real. Normally if you get it though, it's known as a very fast-acting type
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  of cancer. It's a cancer that kills you in about a week or two. And so I've read a lot
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  of their publications and I've done a lot of research, but I was watching Jay Dyer yesterday
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  in the fourth hour. I'm going to invite him on with us tomorrow. I haven't asked him yet.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  I just decided to do this about 30 months ago. But regardless, I'll be covering all the
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  documents myself. And to see if he wants to do an hour commercial free with us to go into
[09:35.000 --> 09:45.000]  these, because this is their publications, their books, their top people, and their admission.
[09:45.000 --> 09:53.000]  And so I want to explain something to everybody. This globalist runaway, breakaway civilization,
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  the sign of a takeover, has been beta testing for decades. Now they've gone live. And this
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  is definitely the big one. I knew they had some plans to release bile weapons, scare us,
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  lock us down for a while, and then incrementally release bile weapons that were more deadly
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  to slowly cull our numbers. They decided to just go all the way with this with delayed
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.000]  kill operations. And now, again, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, head of vaccines,
[10:22.000 --> 10:29.000]  head of allergy development, came out in the big life site interview at theconinfowords.com.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  He posted the whole thing. And he said, I'm sorry. I was always a mainline guy, but I've
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  reverse engineered this. And this is a poisonous gene therapy that is going to start shutting
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  everybody's livers down within six months to one year. And it's also going to cause brain
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  plaques. And it's also going to attack the babies in utero. And it's the end of humanity.
[10:52.000 --> 10:59.000]  That's the former chief's chief scientist, former Pfizer VP. Your government is lying
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.000]  to you in a way that could lead to your death. That's a quote. So I'm reading that yesterday
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  because a bunch of people sent it to me. And I'd already talked about he signed on with
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  Wolfgang Woodard, the head of the private advisory commission to the EU, very prestigious.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  And Woodard, he wrote a big letter on December 1st begging Europe not to approve any of the
[11:21.000 --> 11:28.000]  vaccines, not the virus vectors, not the Pfizer, not any of it. It was all the same thing.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  And he got almost no attention. And they followed an injunction. And the EU just rushed
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  to the side. But now when he said in that report in December, here we are four months
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  later, and everything they talked about is now coming true. You have to understand in
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  the SPARS report, it also says within six months to a year, the brain fog, the sponge
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  informant cephalopathy, the prions, the mad cow disease you'll be enjoying, the liver
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  failure you'll be enjoying. But they're going to say when that happens that another virus
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  is doing it. That's why they picked the common cold because now they're just going to claim
[12:03.000 --> 12:11.000]  oh, there's a new variant of COVID that did this to you. But they own it out of a lab
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  so they can release more deadly versions of it later. They've actually tested and cooked
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  up and already tested on animals and humans. So when they said skip animal trials, they
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  actually did animal trials under other names. Starting about a decade ago, we have all those
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  documents. We've covered them a year ago with the former, the guy that wrote the U.S.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  Biological Weapons Law, the former head of the United Nations prosecution operation.
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  I mean, that's what insider, as it gets, the top Harvard PhD, Dr. Boyle, he'll tell you
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  all the exact same thing I'm telling you. He predicted a year ago that this was a gene
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  therapy takeover. He's not really predicting it. He knows a little bit more than he says
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  on there, obviously, with his sources. I must say he's involved in any of it. He's just
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  at the top. He's just not part of it. But he's been at the top. So the guy that invented
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  the polio vaccine said there's too many people we need to give people cancer. He did. He
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  gave my grandmother a polio, a live polio vaccine. They told her she got it from him.
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  And she also got infected, obviously, with SV40, the cancer virus, but her body fought
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  it off. So, you know, these people are hurtness and they're hurting us all, and they mean
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.000]  business. So tomorrow, I'm going to release all this huge information. Now, that said,
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  I have a limited size crew. And I'm not complaining. It's just that I can get a lot more done
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  if I had a bigger crew. So they all got back exhausted from the border a day after I got
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  back. I got back Tuesday. They got back Wednesday. And they were up here yesterday working late,
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  going through the hours of footage they have. And so I said, oh, let me see some of the
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  reports you're working on. And this is about an hour before the show. They played me a
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  report and I actually started having an anxiety attack and couldn't even talk for a minute
[13:56.000 --> 14:04.000]  because a thousand points hit my mind of how conditioned we've all gotten just to put up
[14:04.000 --> 14:14.000]  with this. I was witnessing child smuggling from the border to the Catholic charity to
[14:14.000 --> 14:22.000]  which is not even Catholic, the commies group to the airport. And we even have men, they're
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.000]  hiding this saying, I want that woman. I like her. I like her. And then the nun who's got
[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  devil tattoos and grim reaper tattoos of the cartel all over her, the nun, takes the
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  women's cell phones. They're not even hiding this. And so you don't get these anymore. And
[14:38.000 --> 14:44.000]  then the women are sent. So I mean, we're basically watching options. And these people
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  think this is so normal. So you always heard about slave blocks and then they're selling
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.000]  slaves upon a block and people are bidding on them. I'm sitting there watching this and
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  we have hours of this. And we're all so conditioned that even my team, which is doing a great
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  job, they're overworked, exhausted, is like, oh, yeah, here's this. We confront them.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  Meanwhile, you've got the national news in over 100 publications saying, I'm made up
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  of the smuggling. And then it, oh, it's fake. They said it's theater, but it's real. But
[15:18.000 --> 15:28.000]  they were helping the children are cramming in the back of the trunk. Unbelievable. Snopes.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  So I have now officially seen it all. And so I think God, we got banned on video. I'm not
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  sure how long, but the Texas Rangers could go in there and an hour, any of these places
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  are massive crimes. It's definitely illegal. They're smuggling them across the border. And
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  what they're doing is illegal and they're taking their phones away. And there's literally
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  dudes when they're going, I want this one. I want that one. I mean, I'm speechless. I
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  mean, I'm just speechless at this point. You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  it. And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us. For a lot of reasons,
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  I can't tell you what's going on. But let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  buy the products. And then forwardstore.com. They're great products. Plus, they fund the
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  operation. So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything

[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  It's at infowarstore.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[18:39.000 --> 18:46.000]  So down in South Texas and it's going on in Arizona and California and all across the
[18:46.000 --> 18:55.000]  Southwest border, Mexico, the puppet president said surge the border. They did. Now they're
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  coming across by the hundreds of thousands every week. It's not 170 something thousand
[18:59.000 --> 19:06.000]  a month. It's way above that. That's who they caught. They are then taken to cartel
[19:06.000 --> 19:21.000]  facilities that masquerade as charities and single women, women with children are processed
[19:21.000 --> 19:28.000]  like you would process produce and these different liberal NGOs, but also private
[19:28.000 --> 19:38.000]  individuals come and say, I want that one. I want this one. And this is in front of news
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  crews. I mean, when I saw this footage this morning, because I left Tuesday night and
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  the crew stayed another day and then they drove back. This is in McAllen, Texas. And
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.000]  it was like, it was surreal. It was beyond a movie. It's real. I get what people think
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  that's fake with me jumping in front of the car and the kids being put in the trunk because
[19:59.000 --> 20:10.000]  it just doesn't seem real. But it is. Well, this footage is powerful. And I said, I'm going
[20:10.000 --> 20:15.000]  to play that at the start of the show. And Rob Deuston, oh, no, I got stuff even worse.
[20:15.000 --> 20:19.000]  Let me go through all our hours of footage and put it out. And I'm like, I understand
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  you're going to get back to your wife and family. I understand you had to take a rest.
[20:22.000 --> 20:25.000]  We were working 14 hours a day before that. But we've just got to hire more people. We've
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  got to be able to process all this. I mean, that's the frustration here is that look at
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  all these articles of your TV viewer. Like I've looked at most of these. I've read a lot
[20:35.000 --> 20:41.000]  of these. This is not a stunt, like a prop to have this up. One of these I can talk for
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  a full hour or not. The death of the Duke of Edinburgh. The global government, Bill Gates
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  officially wanting to black out the sun. I told you that in 1995. All of this is insane.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  You could talk for a whole show about geoengineering and Bill Gates now admitting he's behind it.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  Of course he is. I made films about it. And boy, do they make fun of me. He even found
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  articles like 10 years ago. Jones claims Bill Gates controls the weather. Because I have
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  all the department energy documents. And of course they're playing God. You know how small
[21:13.000 --> 21:20.000]  the planet is? Very easy to manipulate things. And I have all the admissions. So I've got
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  all this news. But even bigger than the collapse border and the lawlessness and all of it is
[21:26.000 --> 21:34.000]  the chief scientist at Pfizer. Who left on good terms. Big scientist. He's only some
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.000]  disgraced person saying this is designed to depopulate you in a huge interview. And he said
[21:40.000 --> 21:46.000]  the media is lying. The way we're being censored. The way it's all being done. He lays out
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  in December what was going to happen with other top scientists. And now it's happening.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  And he just said, my God, they're not just being opportunistic, making money. This is
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  a strategic plan. And it sounds like I wrote what he says. You're like, that's Alex Jones.
[22:00.000 --> 22:09.000]  It's not Alex Jones. If you go to the zoo and you see a seal bouncing
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  on a beach ball on its nose and everybody sees the same thing, you see it because it
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  happened. Hey, look, it's bouncing a beach ball. He gave it a fish. Hey, what do you see?
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  He bounced the beach ball. You want to watch a football game. You all see the same thing
[22:20.000 --> 22:29.000]  together. All that quarterback is through that 30-yard pass. That was a good pass.
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  We all see the same thing because Bill Gates even says he wants to kill everybody. And
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  people used to say, why does Jones obsess on Bill Gates? Because every time I dug into
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  something, whether it was Jeffrey Epstein or whether it was secret cloning operations
[22:42.000 --> 22:50.000]  or whether it was weather modification, he is the chairman of the secret global medical
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  mafia. And the guy that ties it all together with the UN and the Chai comms and the whole
[22:55.000 --> 23:03.000]  system is Paul Schwab, is the president of the world. Paul Schwab is like the president.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  The president is like the president of Coca-Cola. He goes to parties and promotes the overall
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  idea and has the big meetings. It's the guys behind the scenes running it. The scientists,
[23:12.000 --> 23:17.000]  the generals, what you want to call the controllers. I say generals, I don't mean military generals,
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  I mean the generals of the new world order. The field marshals that are running this military
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  operation against us. And Bill Gates is the science officer. In fact, they even call him
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  that. They even say he is the chief science officer. I told you 10 years ago he's the
[23:29.000 --> 23:38.000]  chief science officer. Now there are articles calling him the planet's science officer.
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.000]  And I learned, studying history and growing up and seeing some of it, that the real global
[23:44.000 --> 23:51.000]  government is a scientific cult run by science officers. And that's what they call themselves,
[23:51.000 --> 23:57.000]  is science officers. And you know what, if you won't grow up and at least address them
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  at their level and know what's going on, you have no hope. They have no respect for you
[24:01.000 --> 24:08.000]  because you won't even read their writings and address them head on. They respect me.
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  I respect them. They're very evil bad people. But the fact that folks want to play games
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  and deny this for short term expediency just to feel like you're in control and you're
[24:19.000 --> 24:26.000]  not, is the reason they believe they have a right to do this to you. Well as an audience
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  of activists, I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the sheep out there that tune in
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  and think this is funny. But let me just stop here. I'm going to come back and hit all this
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.000]  and get into it. It's just so much today. And try to cover as much of this as I can.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  But let me just say this. I am spending all the capital I have. I have already helped
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  other people get equipment and producers and kept people on air and beefed up Band-Aid
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  video and then a lot of other things. And I'm maxed out. And I'm just going to trust
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  God and I'm just going to spend all the money in our reserves and hire what I need to cover
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  the border and cover globalism and just do what I have to. But I'll tell you this. It's
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.000]  very frustrating to have an extra 5, 10 million people visiting the sites a day right now.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  But revenue is down because people just do not buy anything at infowarstore.com. And I
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  get sponsors and then they get an okay response but it's not what we need to operate. Notice
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  I brought some sponsors back on. So I need you to understand that this is the tip of
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  the spear. And when you fund, this is the tip of the spear. Plus these are products you absolutely need.
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  So get t-shirts, get books, get water filtration, get air filtration, get shortwave radios, get
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  the supplements like vitamin mineral fusion back in stock and winter sun. You need them.
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  They're high grade, high quality. And get some brain force plus and get some lung cleanse
[25:44.000 --> 25:51.000]  and get some fish oil and our krill oil is highest grade. And do your shopping with us
[25:51.000 --> 26:00.000]  because it's very frustrating to exhaust some of the crew I have and then not even have crew
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  do what I need to. Listen, you already see us delivering on every front with the hardcore
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  knowledge. I need more people. And I'm not just mortgage my house. I'm putting it up for sale
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  next week and I'm selling everything because there's not going to be anything here anyways.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  And I'm going to fight to the very end and evacuate to the countryside when the whole
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  thing comes down. And I've got the whole blueprint of how that's going to look. It's going to be
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  sooner than I thought. And you're not going to recognize anything in two or three years
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  if we don't stop them. We could push them back. But I'm just telling you, you're going to have
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  tens of millions of people dying next year from the vaccines they took. And I'm going to explain
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  how all that's going to work as well. So you better tell people to tune in. You better pray to God
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  and you better spread the word because I'm telling you it's on. And we're one of the main
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  weapons in the fight against this. General Flynn told you that many others have. We need your
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  support. So take action at infowarstore.com. I want to thank all of you that have been
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  supporting us. You've changed the world.
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking
[27:02.000 --> 27:08.000]  agents of the enemy. And a lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh no,
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible. And I understand why people are going to believe
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  that because this is scary what's going on with the global government and the New World
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  Order. Now that people hold up the fact that that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  Well, Trump sure has held pride. My gosh, let's get out. Prescription drug prices just
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  tripled for quadruple, depending on the drug, once by the sign of that executive order.
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  We pay the most of anybody in the world. That's just one case of hundreds of things that
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  Trump had reversed. And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election
[27:47.000 --> 27:53.000]  and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity. Because the fix is in, folks. The swamp is deep.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to
[28:02.000 --> 28:11.000]  understand that this is all a test. This experience, this wifeless planet is a reckoning.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so that we can
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to. And it really
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  does come down to that. So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[28:30.000 --> 28:36.000]  God is the author of us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  And that free will is a beautiful thing. When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.000]  and this whole evil culture in Washington, D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  about dominating your free will. It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly,
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  you're in the bad. Because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  creator of the universe.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  Randy Dewright. Randy Dewright. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.000]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded
[29:14.000 --> 29:20.000]  up the sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  I was already taking your other supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.000]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time, I started
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.000]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know.
[29:46.000 --> 29:52.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[29:52.000 --> 29:56.000]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[29:56.000 --> 30:04.000]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[30:04.000 --> 30:09.000]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.000]  massive censorship and organized crime racketeering. That's why they've been massively expanding
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  their services. So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and
[30:23.000 --> 30:30.000]  they're expanding. And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services
[30:30.000 --> 30:36.000]  at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  to fund the info war. And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services
[30:41.000 --> 30:46.000]  that you get from them. So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again
[30:46.000 --> 30:52.000]  because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free. So infowarsdomains.com
[30:52.000 --> 30:57.000]  the revolution starts there. infowarsdomains.com take action now.
[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  We're back live. Want to thank you all for joining us. We'll thank you for the great job
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.000]  they're doing. Let me tell you about some of the big guests we've got coming up today. Brad
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  Keys was that high school track coach that got fired because he wasn't in the cult and
[31:34.000 --> 31:41.000]  wouldn't make his students wear masks when they ran their races. We also have Theresa
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  Mullins, the flight attendant that quit her job over the mask torture of children and
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000]  more. These are folks that are standing up and every time we call them, they're listeners.
[31:51.000 --> 31:55.000]  They're honored that it's our listeners that are the front line of the global fight including
[31:55.000 --> 31:59.000]  the church up in Canada. There's a bunch of churches up in Canada. Letters thing go to
[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  tyranny. And our guest host Steve Peters does an amazing job. He'll be hosting the fourth
[32:04.000 --> 32:09.000]  hour and has that Polish pastor from Calgary that kicked the Gestapo out will be on the
[32:09.000 --> 32:16.000]  transmission coming up today. All of this is the Communist Chinese model that's not coming.
[32:16.000 --> 32:22.000]  It's here. As the Prime Minister of Canada said, China's dictatorship is the model and
[32:22.000 --> 32:31.000]  he admires it. Close quote. They're basic dictatorship. Let me read you a few other
[32:31.000 --> 32:37.000]  headlines just so you get the flavor of where we're at because it's just settled in on me
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000]  like you think you're awake and then every 24 hours now I become even more awake. And
[32:42.000 --> 32:47.000]  I always in my mind try to be as accurate as I can with all the data but I subconsciously
[32:47.000 --> 32:54.000]  wanted to push it off in my mind further. The total collapse, the takeover. But if they're
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.000]  able to continue the domino effect they've got happening right now, people submitting.
[32:59.000 --> 33:03.000]  I mean, England said, okay, it's official. You want to go in a store, go in a bar. You
[33:03.000 --> 33:08.000]  got to have a COVID passport. Next will be you want food. You got to have it or we're going
[33:08.000 --> 33:13.000]  to have it. But they said for months, oh, we'll never do that. It's a conspiracy theory.
[33:13.000 --> 33:20.000]  So no opposition would form. It's all psychological. So when they did it, it would just go through.
[33:20.000 --> 33:28.000]  We have that information. But look at these headlines. Bill Gates backs project to dim
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  the sun. Tucker Carlson reacts. Now, what happened is Gates is already heading up a
[33:34.000 --> 33:41.000]  department of energy programs since 1995 doing this as a high altitude aerosol campaign. They
[33:41.000 --> 33:47.000]  have hearings and symposiums and congressional reports and C-SPAN events and the CIA puts
[33:47.000 --> 33:53.000]  up press releases and the Council on Foreign Relations puts out huge essays on it. And then
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.000]  I cover it. The news says he's insane. It doesn't exist. But they go, oh, that's just a
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  condensation trail up there. Alex, don't be an idiot. Well, no, we know there's real
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  condensation that disappears in a few minutes. The ice crystals and then there's artificial
[34:06.000 --> 34:14.000]  nuclei sprayed out. But just think about Trump and said, I'm going to block out the sun. They
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  say, what are you, Dr. Evil? Are you a supervillain? But why is it Bill Gates? Oh, Bill Gates went
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  to a European country and said, we want you to launch a rocket and spray some out the
[34:24.000 --> 34:33.000]  test. Out further towards the sun, some kind of a false ring of dust reflecting the sun
[34:33.000 --> 34:40.000]  back. And finally, Sweden and others that he asked to do it said no. But that was just
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  them trying to entice them like a heroin dealer or a fentanyl dealer. We'll try to, you know,
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  give heroin to 13-year-olds on the school ground like, here, have a little baggie of
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  this. You know, like George Floyd was out doing here. Enjoy some fentanyl. By the way,
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  his drug dealer's lawyer said he will not testify under the Fifth Amendment because he'll be
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  indicted for killing George Floyd. The evidence says they killed George Floyd. Well, of course,
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  he had three times the limit to kill a man his size. But that's okay because it's more
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.000]  fun to just have racial division in the country. But continuing, this is where we are. So
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  you've got a mad scientist that has his PR groups everywhere saying black people are
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  twice as unlikely to be vaccinated because of racism. We're going to go to their houses
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  with the army and tell them they should really take it. And I see videos of like old black
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  women going, Jesus, love me. I hope I don't die. I'm scared. While they're giving them
[35:31.000 --> 35:38.000]  shots. And then I know people that have taken the shots and gotten deadly ill or people I
[35:38.000 --> 35:48.000]  warned whose elderly parents took it and one of them died a day later. I mean, I know people
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  dying. And the numbers are, it's off the chart. That's just because it's so strong,
[35:54.000 --> 35:59.000]  ladies and gentlemen. It's meant to kill you in the actuaries in six months, a year, two
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  years, five years. It's a soft kill weapon. And that's what the former chief science
[36:02.000 --> 36:12.000]  advisor, former chief scientist at Pfizer just came out and said, he said, this is a
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  planned operation. And I've looked at what it does. And it's going to attack fertility.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  It's going to attack your immune system. It's going to cause autoimmune response.
[36:21.000 --> 36:27.000]  And it's going to shut off your liver. Because they know a lot of these gene
[36:27.000 --> 36:35.000]  therapies. You can get it to change what you want, but it always hurts the liver. And
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  then, oh, who knows why everybody's dying of no liver? Like all these mothers and young
[36:40.000 --> 36:47.000]  people that go get the shot and they're dead in three days from total organ failure, the
[36:47.000 --> 36:58.000]  kidneys, the liver, the gallbladder, the lungs, the heart, it's all bye-bye. And what a
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  surprise, a guy that wants to black out the sun, a guy that wants you to eat GMO, a guy
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.000]  that bought into Monsanto and all the Agent Orange, a guy that says he wants to populate
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  the earth, he wants to genetically engineer some mosquitoes to suck your blood and
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  sterilize you with a vaccine delivery system. This is all public. The guy that says we
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  should kill old people is pushing something that kills people. Wow. A guy that's banned
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  in 30-plus countries and whose Pfizer-backed vaccine was banned in India. Remember when
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  I first reported that months ago and they said, oh, Snoop said it wasn't true. Oh, well,
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  Snoop said so. Really, how many countries have banned Pfizer last time I checked? Over
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  20. How many have banned the J&J a bunch? How many have banned the AstraZeneca? Oh, it's
[37:45.000 --> 37:55.000]  over 50 last time I checked. 26 in Europe. Oh, but Snoop said it's not true. Okay. All
[37:55.000 --> 38:02.000]  right. That's fine. So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, and they don't care
[38:02.000 --> 38:09.000]  anymore. I want to explain something. When you're at a so-called major charity and there
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  are children brought in sometimes alone begging for mama with men, with women, and the nuns
[38:17.000 --> 38:26.000]  have tattoos all over them of the drug cartels, both arms, both legs, and they take the women's
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  phones away and then a man comes and says, I want that one. I want this one. And we're
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.000]  like filming this. And he's just, hey, they're coming anyways because they're so confident,
[38:38.000 --> 38:48.000]  folks. This is in front of us. And then the national media sits there and says, oh, Governor
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.000]  Abbott claims there's sex abuse. Oh, folks, there's dead bodies all over the place. There's
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  rape children. I interviewed law enforcement that is having nervous breakdowns and doesn't
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  know what to do because they're in the facilities and there are adults and other teenagers raping
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  babies. And the governor finally has a soul and says it's horrible. He needs the feds
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  to stop it or he needs the Texas Rangers to go in and the media attacks the governor and
[39:15.000 --> 39:22.000]  says, oh, he's a conspiracy theorist. Ladies and gentlemen, again, people say, oh, my gosh,
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  you have all this footage. Yes, we have hours of it. You're like, why did you get that up?
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  I love the comments on Band-Aid videos. Jones ought to do this. Jones ought to do that.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  You know what? I really should do that. You know, other revolutionaries rob banks and
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  stuff, and I'm not going to rob banks. But you know, if you're stopping child smuggling
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  and the banks are laundering the money at a certain point, maybe you do rob banks to get
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  money to fight them. You know what I mean? Maybe that's an idea there. But see, I'm not
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  going to do that myself. I'm not being literal here. What I'm saying is, what do you expect
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  us to do? What do you want me to do? I'm working 18 hours a day. I cannot even get all this
[39:59.000 --> 40:09.000]  out on air. Everything is unfolding. It is totally insane. And I'm not complaining because
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  I don't have PTSD and I don't play the victim here. Can you imagine being around this stuff
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  for 27 years and then now it's coming to the quickening? And you do want to get a lot done.
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  You do want to have more reporters. You do want to have more crew. But you can't even find
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.000]  the good people or get the money to hire them. So I'll say it again. We need funds. Go to
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  m4warstore.com. There's a support button right there. You can make $5, $10, $100 donations.
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  That way we actually get almost all the money, 95% of it, instead of, you know, by the products
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.000]  we get 30, 40, 50%. I need money. I'm spending all the money we got to do this. You're going
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  to see major action, but get in there and get products you need at the same time. At
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  m4warstore.com, show me that you support us. Show us what you want us to do. I'm going
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  to commit no matter what. I'm going all the way to the end like an old horse. I'll keep
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  running till my heart blows up. Stay with us. When I tell you to supplement your natural
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.000]  diet, so you'll be healthier and funnier and funnier at the same time, I'm not lecturing
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  you. I eat too much red meat. I drink too much. I work too much. I have my own issues
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  with stress. But I can tell you without winter sun, without vitamin mineral fusion, without
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.000]  lung cleanse, all three of which I take every day, I would not be able to continue in one
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.000]  day. These are amazing products. And if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals,
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  you're not going to be able to function. In fact, you're going to die as we will starve
[41:27.000 --> 41:33.000]  for lack of food. These products have it all concentrated in one place for you to make
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  sure that every essential vitamin mineral you need, you get the D3, the K, in winter
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.000]  sun, and all of them together with amino acids in vitamin mineral fusion, and then lung
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  cleanse, research with yourself. It's amazing. They're all 50% off together, 40% off individually
[41:50.000 --> 42:15.000]  at infowarstore.com, back at stock for a limited time, and if I'm seeing four, I'm up here
[42:15.000 --> 42:22.000]  spanking white and black. It doesn't matter if you've got red blood. And if you love freedom
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years. And as crazy
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  your things are, I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done, and
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully
[42:52.000 --> 43:21.000]  it'll touch your heart to continue to support infowarstore. God bless.
[43:22.000 --> 43:48.000]  Thank you.
[43:48.000 --> 44:14.000]  Thank you.
[44:14.000 --> 44:41.000]  Thank you.
[44:41.000 --> 45:03.000]  Thank you.
[45:11.000 --> 45:30.000]  Well, I always knew the New World War was coming.
[45:30.000 --> 45:43.000]  All right, I'm coming in tomorrow, and we're going to tape to air, meaning we're going
[45:43.000 --> 45:50.000]  to tape for two hours, maybe three hours, and then as soon as that's ready, we'll add
[45:50.000 --> 46:04.000]  that on our broadcast.
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  No.
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  Thanks.
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  Oh, thanks.
[46:07.000 --> 46:08.000]  Thanks.
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  All right, thanks for that.
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  Wishing you the day.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  It's been an amazing process.
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.000]  Thanks to Wishing Под honor and the band.
[46:16.000 --> 46:22.400]  video with 10 million views on a certain platform. So shove it down your globalist. You know
[46:22.400 --> 46:27.280]  what? Because we are kicking your ass thanks to the listener's support and thanks to good
[46:27.280 --> 46:32.280]  Lord above. So again, listeners are really knocking it out of the park when it comes
[46:32.280 --> 46:40.080]  to spreading the word. Now you just put change in the kitty. I want to send a 10 man team
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.960]  down and I'm going to, and you heard Ted News just going to, I'm not going to say when,
[46:44.960 --> 46:49.320]  I'm going to send a 10 person team down to the border. And again, I don't really have
[46:49.320 --> 46:54.120]  the money for it. So I told my wife this morning, I said, you know, we're selling this big house.
[46:54.120 --> 46:58.280]  She's like, okay, that's fine. I don't want to be here anyways. Everybody's collapsing.
[46:58.280 --> 47:02.240]  And I said, absolutely. And it's already got a mortgage on it, a big one. So we're just
[47:02.240 --> 47:10.200]  going to sell it and move into a shack somewhere on the edge of town and then have a redoubt
[47:10.200 --> 47:16.120]  at a far off place. But that's it, man. I mean, that's how serious I am about this.
[47:16.120 --> 47:21.600]  This is, this is it. Okay. So it's all going away. I'm not trying to be negative here.
[47:21.600 --> 47:27.000]  You need to know this. You need to know that nothing you see, like when Christ pointed
[47:27.000 --> 47:33.920]  to the Pharisees at Jerusalem and he said, before this generation passes, that's 75
[47:33.920 --> 47:39.440]  years on average, there will not be one stone sitting on top of another here and 70 years
[47:39.440 --> 47:49.520]  to the day Jerusalem fell and Titus leveled it and gave the order that not one stone be
[47:49.520 --> 47:57.480]  left standing. Well, I'm not saying and I'm not Christ. I'm just saying that's an example
[47:57.480 --> 48:04.160]  that I got level, spiritual level, intellectual level, military level. I'm telling you that
[48:04.160 --> 48:09.840]  it's it's done. I have all the top scientists concurring with what I'm saying. Former head
[48:09.840 --> 48:14.080]  of defense intelligence, top other individuals that do this for a living and they say, no,
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.440]  it's all true. This is a total takedown plan. The former chief scientist at Pfizer says
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.800]  it is a planetary collapse takeover plan. Do you know what's going to happen in a year,
[48:23.800 --> 48:28.160]  two years when hundreds of millions of people are sick in America from the vaccine? We're
[48:28.160 --> 48:34.160]  the most vaccinated country. It will collapse the whole country. It's a planned takedown.
[48:34.160 --> 48:41.880]  America is under chemical biological attack right now through the NIH and Fauci engaged.
[48:41.880 --> 48:50.800]  The chai comms ran the fair operation and now it's here. And they think you're so stupid,
[48:50.800 --> 48:53.840]  they're going to carry all this out and they even war game how they're going to condition
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.800]  you and say another virus is what's going to kill you in six months to a year. That's
[48:57.800 --> 49:01.080]  what I said. Bill Gates will come out and say a more deadly virus is coming and he did
[49:01.080 --> 49:08.040]  it because I know their plan and then I found damn plans that say just that because these
[49:08.040 --> 49:16.240]  people operate the same. I know I'm up one side down the other backwards and forwards.
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.400]  And here's the deal. You're the one thing. I thought they might have some self preservation
[49:20.400 --> 49:34.280]  left in them. But they are under Satan's control and under orders from the fallen one. And the
[49:34.280 --> 49:41.600]  fallen one that they're so enamored with is ordering them to kill everybody if they want
[49:41.600 --> 49:46.480]  to have a chance to live. So they're held hostage too. Bill Gates and all these people,
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.960]  they're all held hostage by this damn entity. And everybody already knows in their guts
[49:51.960 --> 50:01.560]  that's what it is. It's a non human force. And that's why they've got all this super
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.720]  science and that's why they've kept us at this arrested level and they give us 50 year
[50:05.720 --> 50:13.320]  old technology with Trojan horses in it because they're breaking away from us. They've made
[50:13.320 --> 50:20.840]  the decision and we all just sit here like fools and go along with that acting like as
[50:20.840 --> 50:27.120]  they take more of our freedoms if we just give in to their oppression, they'll let us
[50:27.120 --> 50:30.600]  go back to the movie theaters and let us go back to the ball games. Oh yeah, if you have
[50:30.600 --> 50:35.760]  your digital scan, if you have all your shots that kill you. And the top scientists all
[50:35.760 --> 50:39.960]  look at this and all of a sudden they go this doesn't protect you from a cold. This causes
[50:39.960 --> 50:44.280]  people to produce deadly variants. This causes people to have autoimmune disorders. I mean
[50:44.280 --> 50:50.640]  I have the whole article posted from life site news.com. It's on info wars.com. Share
[50:50.640 --> 51:01.000]  it now. Exclusive former Pfizer VP, your government is trying to kill your ass. And he says that
[51:01.000 --> 51:07.600]  in here. Your government is lying to you in a way that can lead to your death. Dr. Michael
[51:07.600 --> 51:13.280]  Eden, Pfizer's former vice president and chief scientist for allergy and respiratory. They're
[51:13.280 --> 51:20.480]  33 years recently retired and it goes right into it right here. He says it is a takeover
[51:20.480 --> 51:28.840]  plan. It is a conspiracy, not just convergent opportunism. In game, vaccine passports tied
[51:28.840 --> 51:38.040]  to spending allowances through control, social credit score, carbon credits. And he goes
[51:38.040 --> 51:44.720]  on to say you introduce characteristics which could be harmful and could even be lethal.
[51:44.720 --> 51:49.600]  And you can even tune it in and let's put in some gene that will cause liver injury over
[51:49.600 --> 51:53.960]  the nine month period or cause your kidneys to fail but not until you encounter this kind
[51:53.960 --> 51:59.200]  of organism. That would be quite possible. It's a binary weapon. Biotechnology provides
[51:59.200 --> 52:03.560]  you with limitless ways, frankly, to injure or kill billions of people. And he goes through
[52:03.560 --> 52:12.200]  to say looking at the vaccine is what it's designed to do. This is serious people. Remember
[52:12.200 --> 52:17.400]  what Bill Joyce said in 1999 in an article in the cover of Wired Magazine, why the future
[52:17.400 --> 52:23.720]  doesn't need us. Remember what he said. He said I went to a conference with 200 plus
[52:23.720 --> 52:28.680]  top billionaires, owners of big tech, all of them were there for a three day weekend
[52:28.680 --> 52:34.000]  at a closed conference and we said there's too many people and humans have become obsolete
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.520]  and we're not just going to replace them with robots. We just need to go ahead and either
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.680]  let them entertain themselves and sterilize everybody but let them live out their lives
[52:41.680 --> 52:46.680]  and then phase out most of humanity. Or we just go ahead and start killing everybody
[52:46.680 --> 52:58.040]  and the decision was go ahead and kill everybody. And then he goes on to say maybe the unabomber
[52:58.040 --> 53:03.160]  is right cause you know the unabomber was in the CIA who wasn't just an MK ultra. This
[53:03.160 --> 53:06.640]  is all the classified and he thought about this and got really freaked out and started
[53:06.640 --> 53:10.280]  trying to blow up people who was involved to say we just need to go back to an agrarian
[53:10.280 --> 53:17.080]  society. His thing was just don't have technology at all. Imagine being in the CIA and they
[53:17.080 --> 53:21.400]  brief you on this. Well I mean they briefed my dad when he was in high school on this
[53:21.400 --> 53:25.800]  cause he was in plan 2 at UT. They were obviously trying to recruit him into that. He got out
[53:25.800 --> 53:33.720]  of it. But that's how widespread this is ladies and gentlemen. But the group trying to recruit
[53:33.720 --> 53:40.000]  my dad was above the CIA. It was the scientist. That's who it is. That's who runs it. That's
[53:40.000 --> 53:45.920]  what they call themselves. So it's their world. We're just living it until we wake
[53:45.920 --> 53:51.600]  up to this and say no. So next hour I'm going to get it done. I'm not hurrying them cause
[53:51.600 --> 53:56.680]  I saw this bombshell footage and there's hours of it. They're trying to boil it down
[53:56.680 --> 54:10.440]  for you. Of basically all humans being auctioned off. And then by tomorrow I said I have a
[54:10.440 --> 54:12.760]  talk with Rob too. I love. He wants to be up for 7 days a week. He said listen I got
[54:12.760 --> 54:16.680]  to be with my family some cause he's moving next week. And I just said sorry you're coming
[54:16.680 --> 54:20.280]  in tomorrow aren't you? He goes yeah actually I will come in tomorrow. But that's why I'm
[54:20.280 --> 54:24.680]  bitching about the fact is I don't have anybody here man. Everybody's been working 7-8 days
[54:24.680 --> 54:29.440]  a week. Literally sometimes you know there's only 7 days a week. It's a joke. But we're
[54:29.440 --> 54:34.200]  not complaining. It's just that it's crazy how much data we have and how out of control
[54:34.200 --> 54:42.680]  it is. But I'll cover it all next hour. Then we have the man coming on who got fired cause
[54:42.680 --> 54:48.480]  he wouldn't make the race team, the track and field team wear a mask, Brad Keyes and
[54:48.480 --> 54:55.480]  then Theresa Mullis is coming on. She's the flight attendant that quit over all the tyranny
[54:55.480 --> 54:57.360]  and evil. But understand this is just the beginning. They're not just getting a world
[54:57.360 --> 55:03.320]  ID in place and all this to control us. They're getting it all in place so then they're going
[55:03.320 --> 55:07.880]  to launch their main attack. And when they tell you you're not essential, they're telling
[55:07.880 --> 55:12.320]  you we're going to kill you. And then oh I want to be cool. I want to be back to the
[55:12.320 --> 55:15.880]  movies. I want my job back. I want to be able to be essential. Well you do that by saying
[55:15.880 --> 55:21.520]  you're essential and not complying. But instead you roll your sleeve up and take the shot.
[55:21.520 --> 55:25.840]  You're dead. Might take a year. Might take three years. Might take five years. But you're
[55:25.840 --> 55:31.880]  dead. That's why Gatesville wants ten shots. He wants to make sure you die. All right. He'll
[55:31.880 --> 55:35.400]  be right back, ladies and gentlemen. This is unbelievable. We're going to lay it all

[57:08.440 --> 57:13.360]  Antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living Defense brought me back. I wanted
[57:13.360 --> 57:19.280]  to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew
[57:19.280 --> 57:26.320]  24, verse 9. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and
[57:26.320 --> 57:32.560]  ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and
[57:32.560 --> 57:37.440]  shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at, brother.
[57:37.440 --> 57:41.840]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[57:41.840 --> 57:49.640]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[57:49.640 --> 58:01.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:01.800 --> 58:11.080]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight we often accuse politicians of dishonesty
[58:11.080 --> 58:15.800]  on this show, but there are grades of it. Let's boil it down. Nothing the Democratic
[58:15.800 --> 58:22.480]  Party advocates for is more dishonest than gun control. Everything about that one specific
[58:22.480 --> 58:27.000]  issue is false. Most policy debates actually aren't like that, and we try to be honest
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.160]  about it on the show. No matter how passionate you are about a position that you have, you
[58:31.160 --> 58:35.720]  can still sort of see what the other side is talking about. You might for example deeply
[58:35.720 --> 58:40.040]  dislike taxes, but you can still acknowledge it is fair to charge people for the services
[58:40.040 --> 58:44.360]  they receive from the government. So the other side isn't crazy, they just arrived at a different
[58:44.360 --> 58:49.160]  number than you did. Or you can hate abortion, and we do, and you can still understand, again
[58:49.160 --> 58:53.200]  if you're being totally honest about it, why a scared pregnant teenager might be tempted
[58:53.200 --> 59:00.520]  to have one. But gun control is not like that. Gun control is entirely fraudulent. The Democratic
[59:00.520 --> 59:06.200]  Party claims that guns cause violence. That's the core claim, and it is a lie. It is provably
[59:06.200 --> 59:12.200]  untrue. The places in this country that have the most guns and the loosest controls on
[59:12.200 --> 59:18.480]  those guns also have the least gun violence, the fewest killings. That's the bottom line.
[59:18.480 --> 59:23.160]  You could look it up. It's publicly available to anyone. Anyone who tries to restrict your
[59:23.160 --> 59:29.680]  legally owned firearms is not trying to make America safer. The point is to disarm you,
[59:29.680 --> 59:35.000]  to strip you of your autonomy, your power, your right of self-defense. Gun control is
[59:35.000 --> 59:43.480]  not about guns. Gun control is about who controls America. Is it the population, as in a democracy?
[59:43.480 --> 59:49.120]  Or does all control go to a small group of authoritarians, as in an oligarchy? Those
[59:49.120 --> 59:55.760]  are the stakes in the gun control debate. It's not about guns, it's about who runs the country.
[59:55.760 --> 1:00:00.080]  So with that in mind, Joe Biden's speech today calling for more gun control should make you
[1:00:00.080 --> 1:00:04.320]  uncomfortable. Almost nothing Biden said was true. We could go down the list, but here
[1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:08.560]  are a few highlights to give you the flavor. Biden claimed that firearms purchased at gun
[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:13.720]  shows are exempt from background checks. That's a lie. He's anyone who's ever been to a gun
[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:18.640]  show can tell you. Joe Biden claimed that gun manufacturers have total immunity against
[1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:24.400]  lawsuits. That's also a lie. Gun manufacturers get sued all the time. Ask them.
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:29.880]  Good pause. So yeah, the same group of Democrat Party lawyers that sued Remington into bankruptcy
[1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:33.400]  are the people trying to sue me into bankruptcy. I mean, it's just again, the level and his
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:38.000]  own son would have been under red flag laws instead of gone to jail, but didn't. I'm sorry.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:45.320]  Go back to Dr. Carlson. He announced how he plans to restrict your Second Amendment rights.
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:48.800]  Joe Biden wanted to remind you that those rights are not real in the first place. They
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:56.720]  are not, as he put it, absolute. Nothing I'm about to recommend in any way impinges on
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.880]  the Second Amendment. They're phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment
[1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:08.320]  rights at stake for what we're talking about. But no amendment, no amendment to the Constitution
[1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:15.440]  is absolute. You heard the sirens in the background responding to the skyrocketing crime rate
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:21.440]  in the city he presides over. But the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:25.720]  That's the promise in the U.S. Constitution. But according to Joe Biden, it's still not
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:30.520]  an absolute right, despite what the text says. No, that right is subject to his approval
[1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:33.720]  and his interpretation. Joe Biden is in charge.
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:38.840]  A very powerful full 15 minute report at infowars.com. Please share it. And I know you know about
[1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:41.720]  Dr. Carlson. Most of you are like, yeah, we already watched him last night. I know. Share
[1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:45.120]  him with everybody. That's the whole point. We're in an information war. I know you know
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:49.000]  that. I'm just reminding you that you are everything when it comes to this planet. God
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:54.120]  is in control. But when it comes to action by us little guys, you're the king daddy.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:57.920]  You are the private. You're the captain. You're the colonel. You're the general. You're the
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:03.640]  chief cook and bottle washer. So am I. That's why my family goes, why do you have to preach
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:08.760]  it people in the grocery store or on the street or everywhere? Why do you sit there and shake
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:15.200]  everybody's hand and talk to them because these are the, this is the, this is it. This is the
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:19.000]  war. It's just as important. What I do in person is what I do on air, probably more
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:25.960]  important. And I got to do it every time, everywhere, every place, always because I'm not rolling
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:34.040]  over and bowing down to this anti human crap. I'm going down without a fight. Quotes a product.
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:40.400]  Better to down your feet than live on your knees as a slave. Plus you're going to down
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:46.320]  your damn knees of your slave. Stand up on your feet, what produces prosperity and justice.
[1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:54.320]  So I intend to live on my feet and destroy our enemies. I'll be right back.
[1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:59.480]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:04.480]  the globalist, attacking humanity of all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:09.480]  you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure. So I get to
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:12.880]  see things that the republic doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:20.360]  chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:25.520]  people are really, really away from the establishment. They don't want to go on with the globalist,
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:31.240]  but they're scared, they're looking for leadership. Well, that's where M4 comes in. You fund us,
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:35.680]  you support M4store.com, you get rape prostitution at the same time. We will then go out and
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:40.800]  do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target you for to show
[1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:46.120]  people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's our job. So please
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:51.360]  keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock groups in the information
[1:03:51.360 --> 1:04:06.160]  war. Fund us at M4store.com.
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:17.000]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones. World government
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:22.320]  has been officially announced by the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve. We'll look
[1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:27.880]  at the real implications of that coming up next segment. Thank you so much for joining
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:34.440]  us today. Sometime during the broadcast as we're finishing it up now, we're going to
[1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:38.640]  air exclusive footage from the border that if you think us jumping in front of that car
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:42.200]  with the smuggled kids, because it's the whole thing's a smuggling operation, and the police
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:45.960]  coming and the kids being in the trunk, which the media tried to say was fake. Now they
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:49.640]  said, well, it really happened, but it's legal what they're doing. So it's fake that Jones
[1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:56.600]  says they're a smuggler trying to play these games. But I left Tuesday. They stayed Wednesday,
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:04.040]  got back Thursday. They just went through the hours of footage, and it's unbelievable.
[1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:09.480]  And I'm going to show even more, because I'm going to do some more research on this and
[1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:14.080]  check with lawyers and people. But I'm going to go ahead and air it all the markets is
[1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:21.000]  the right thing to do. We're going to show you these people's faces and their names.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:25.080]  And they need to be investigated. And we're not going to blur these children's faces because
[1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:32.080]  we need to know what they look like, like a missing persons. You're going to see unattended
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:44.120]  babies being handed off by nuns with devil tattoos all over them, cartel tattoos. And
[1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:49.960]  we have it from deliberate over the border to the facility and then to the airport. And
[1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:55.320]  these people are so arrogant, they let us tape it. And then we've got full grown adults
[1:05:55.320 --> 1:06:00.520]  from the east coast down, and they're not squeezing on the tomatoes or the potatoes
[1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:07.040]  or the cantaloupes. They're literally inspecting the women saying, I want this one. I want
[1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:14.680]  that one. Folks, when I saw this this morning, I literally had the worst anxiety attack
[1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:21.080]  in my life. I mean, I've had less of an anxiety attack watching my son born when my ex-wife
[1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:24.960]  was in labor for like 30 hours, and his heart rate started going down, and he could have
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:29.480]  died and had to do a cesarean. I had a little bit of an anxiety attack. I had trouble breathing.
[1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:36.640]  I saw this. It had a full on, at least one minute of not being able to breathe because
[1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:42.280]  it's what it meant. We just show up and it's all happening. They're like, oh, how do you
[1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:46.000]  get this? It must be staged. This looks so horrible because it's going on constantly.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.840]  They'd be like going to a slaughterhouse on a weekday afternoon and going, damn, there's
[1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:54.200]  a lot of cows getting killed in here. How'd you get all the video on cows getting their
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:59.640]  throat slit? You know, like going to the ND500 and going, sure, there are a lot of race cars
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:06.040]  around here, or going to the NFL game going, damn, there's a lot of football players here.
[1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:15.680]  But coming up, we went inside, folks, and they aren't even hiding it. All right, that's
[1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:26.360]  enough. Thanks. And the guy walks over our cameras and he goes, oh, they're going to
[1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:33.440]  come anyway. It's like, hey, guys, all right, I want her. I want her. And I mean, I'm watching
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:38.960]  this tape. My crew couldn't believe it either. And it gets a lot worse. We have the whistleblowers.
[1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:42.560]  We've talked to law enforcement. They've reported it to the governor. The governor says he's
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:46.880]  going to do something about it. Why is he asking Obama to do it? That's really the president
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:59.200]  of this. I mean, Obyton's running this. So what does this signify that they're doing
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:03.680]  this disgracefully? Remember the Russians 10 years ago? Putin said, we don't allow Americans
[1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:08.200]  to adopt Russians anymore. Because we found out you're giving them to people that are
[1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:14.840]  having sex with them and killing them. And the news is like, gate-line NBC. How dare Putin
[1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:20.720]  say that we're abusing Russian children? Of course they are. Hell, the U.N. constantly
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:33.560]  gets busted. Hillary's up to her eyeballs in it. And it's all like, oh, they're Hispanic.
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:38.680]  We're liberal. All right, here's the baby. Hand him over. We're going to fly this baby
[1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:44.320]  to New York. We're going to fly this baby to L.A. And we're sitting here going, and these
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:52.160]  are like one-year-old babies. And these people are arrogant about it because that's the bravada.
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:09:04.320]  That's the hootspa of hiding it in plain view. What I've seen is, let me just tell you, nobody
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:08.960]  should do anything with the United States. Because the United States doesn't exist anymore.
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:13.080]  That's why I had the anxiety attack. And what I'm saying is, I'm not the guy that hasn't
[1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:18.000]  the anxiety attack. Some people point guns at me. I'm totally chilled. But it was the
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:23.280]  ramification of the country's gone. It's way worse than I thought. Oh, my God, she's got
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:27.800]  grim reaper gang tattoos all over, and they're handing children over. And it's all admitted.
[1:09:27.800 --> 1:09:37.800]  And the FBI waves background checks for the caregivers. Of course they do, because they're
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:44.080]  in the damn cartels. The FBI's gone. If it ever had anybody good, it doesn't matter.
[1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:56.880]  It's the thing. I mean, God, we're, oh, my God. Print me that AP article, please. I didn't
[1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:03.880]  even know AP did an article on it. I mean, where's our soul? Where's our bottom? At what
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:15.080]  point do we stop doing this? I have Zabigniew Brzezinski, top globalist architect 10 years
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:20.880]  ago saying it's easier to kill a million people than it is to control them. And he recommended
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:25.200]  just depopulation saying we can't control the planet. Just kill everybody at the Canadian
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:27.720]  version of the Council on Foreign Relations. We're going to play that for you when we come
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:33.400]  back because it's the same dim the sun, run the planet, John Brennan, oh, we're controlling
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:44.400]  the weather. It's all the same attitude. It's all the same people. It's all the same operation.
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:52.760]  And if they've got the FBI saying, hey, the cartels can just kids are undocumented. Those
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:56.200]  of them are little girls, little boys, little babies, and then they're just being handed
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:02.120]  off with envelopes of cash to random people in the airports all stand down. But oh, we
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:06.000]  all got to get a proctology exam and we fly and we're wearing these masks and we're putting
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:12.880]  up with all this. And they're just getting started. You're like, well, if they go for
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:17.640]  a gun confiscation on the cause of civil war, they want a civil war. And they've got that
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:25.760]  crazy new ATF director that's literally a lunatic. They're all a bunch of freaks. They're all
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:32.560]  a bunch of crazy people that took over because we let them. They stole the damn election.
[1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:36.360]  And now they're going to wreck the whole country and the whole world in the process. So you
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:39.880]  can't stop these people. They're totally possessed by Satan. The rest of the country's
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:46.440]  in a trance. And all we can do is protect ourselves at this point and hope that God's
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:50.560]  spirit re-enter some of these people. But I mean, this is a good versus evil situation
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:54.280]  period. I'm going to come back and hit the geoengineering and how it's such a big deal
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:58.680]  that it's all being broken right now and admitted to. And then we're going to talk about hope
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:03.520]  and how to take action against this by saying no to the world ID, no to the QR code, no
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:08.320]  to the vaccine passports as the chief former scientist at Pfizer said, he said, you must
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:12.800]  block this now. You must stop this now. Ron Paul said, you must stop this now. I've said
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:17.200]  that. This is it. You've got to say no. You know, Paul Watson's got to leave London.
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:20.480]  I saw a tweet where he said, well, I just won't go to restaurants or bars anymore because
[1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:24.480]  I got to have this. No, you got to fight it. You got to turn because actually, you won't
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:31.040]  be able to get food, Paul. Next, they're going to take you to an M camp, Paul. It's all going
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:39.040]  to happen. Next phase, you in run Bill Gates, controlled billable indicates foundation and
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:43.960]  the Clinton global initiative run worldwide, the hiring, the training and the funding for
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:49.720]  the global initiative. Those crazy people, that old crazy man pervert devil or spurn
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:54.760]  his devil or wife, run the program and set a year ago, they're going to come in your
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:57.640]  house. That's what all the college students are going to do and they're going to have
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:03.240]  guns and they're on power trips. And by the way, when you tell them, hey, these vaccines
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:09.120]  are poisonous. They go, we know behind the scenes. They're like, we know, die, die. They're
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:16.000]  coming to kill everybody. They're in on it. They know they're in on it. They are coming
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  to kill you. The chief scientist at Pfizer said, quote, go read the article on info
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.960]  wars.com. He said, they're coming to kill you and your family. They're coming to kill
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:30.400]  you and your family. They're coming to kill you and your family. They're coming to kill
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.040]  you and your family. They're coming to kill you and your family. And they're just ramping
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:38.520]  it up. Oh, oh, they're still deadly strengths. You didn't take it. Oh, it's your fault. Oh,
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:42.560]  someone fought back. Oh, no one taking shots or terrorists. Oh, arrest them all. Oh, oh,
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:46.920]  my God. That's right here. We're going to cover it all. We come back to Brazil. He says
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:50.960]  he's going to kill you. We'll be right back. Of course, he's burning in hell right now
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:58.200]  with Prince Philip. So epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:03.400]  free speech and freedom of association. And they know that big tech is buying up almost
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:07.880]  all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:12.640]  racketeering. That's why they've been massively expanding their services. So whether you have
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:16.680]  domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:23.640]  any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding. And if you go to infowarsdomains.com
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:29.680]  and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up
[1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:34.400]  for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war. And then we get 5% as
[1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:38.800]  well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them. So it's a
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:43.680]  win-win as we build a true open free internet again, because the globalists are destroying
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:51.680]  what was open and what was free. So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there. Infowarsdomains.com,
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:56.320]  take action now. It's hard to believe that we're already in the middle of April and our
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:00.480]  borders collapsing and world governments being announced that Joe Biden's coming after our
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:06.360]  guns and our war with Russia, but told China they could take over Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:12.200]  So China's done a blockade around Taiwan is threatening to invade Hong Kong. They already
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:17.880]  sent troops into Hong Kong. This is madness. And our government's been hijacked now by
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:22.240]  these globalists. They're trying to shut us down. They took our sponsors away a long
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:27.200]  time ago, but you sponsor us by buying products direct. So these are already great products
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:30.880]  you need, whether it's vitamin refusion back in stock or whether it's winter sun or whether
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:36.640]  it's lung cleanse, they're all 40% off individually, 50% off when you order them in combos or together.
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:40.640]  But regardless, it funds the info war with some 360 wins. So it was a critical time
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:43.480]  in history with all those crazy things happening. I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:46.840]  I want to remind you these are products you and your family already need and they fund
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:52.400]  the info war, a true 360 win. So take advantage of these products today. Find them at infowarstore.com.
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:16:03.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:18.720]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones broadcast. When I see all this news about controlling
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:22.800]  the weather and forcibly depopulating us and all these admissions coming out of anything
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:31.680]  that was a victim presents huge horrible evil daughter post the morning psycho Joe on CNBC.
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:35.460]  It makes me think about her father 10 years ago in Canada speaking to their council on
[1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:40.240]  farm relations about the fact that propaganda can't control people anymore. It's cheaper
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:54.240]  just to kill them. Of their power is greater than ever. Their capacity to impose control
[1:16:54.240 --> 1:17:00.680]  over the politically awakened masses of the world is at a historical low. I once put it
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:06.560]  rather pungently and I was flattered that the British prime secretary repeated this
[1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:14.360]  as follows. Namely, in earlier times, it was easier to control a million people. Literally,
[1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:22.560]  it was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:31.880]  Today it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people. Today
[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:40.840]  it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people. Today
[1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:45.600]  it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:49.160]  And the crew did a great job finding that so quickly, but I didn't check it beforehand.
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:52.840]  There's actually him on TV saying that. We'll try to find that. That's kind of a loop of
[1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:56.880]  him saying it, but that is indeed the big number since you can find that clip somewhere.
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:00.360]  It's from 10 years ago. Who knows if they have been taken down, but I remember playing
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:03.800]  it quite a bit on the show, so there's the audio of that they did fine.
[1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:12.720]  Now let's play with the video, the CI director at the time. This is six years ago. John Brennan
[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:22.200]  on transnational threats to global security, June 29, 2016, Council on Foreign Relations.
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:26.160]  And this is him talking about all the weather modification they're already doing and how
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:30.600]  they have UN treaty, need a new treaty, and how they've basically kept it secret from
[1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:35.360]  the public because other folks can have said about it. Here it is.
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:41.040]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering,
[1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:45.560]  that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change. One that
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:52.400]  has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, a method of seeding
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:56.800]  the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:02.120]  that volcanic eruptions do. An SAI program could limit global temperature
[1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:06.720]  increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures, and providing the
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:12.880]  world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels. This process is also relatively
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:18.120]  inexpensive. The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program
[1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:24.040]  would cost about $10 billion yearly. As promising as it may be, moving forward on
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:28.040]  SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international
[1:19:28.040 --> 1:19:31.560]  community. On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:36.800]  reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects,
[1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:42.280]  such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the
[1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:48.960]  atmosphere. On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:54.080]  and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger
[1:19:54.080 --> 1:20:00.640]  sharp opposition by some nations. Others might seize on SAI's benefits and back away from
[1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:06.320]  their commitment to carbon dioxide reductions. And as with other breakthrough technologies,
[1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:10.280]  global norms and standards are lacking to guide the deployment and implementation of
[1:20:10.280 --> 1:20:15.080]  SAI and other geoengineering initiatives. So we're not just going to turn your power
[1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:18.560]  plants off and take away your fertilizer and your meat and everything else to make you
[1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:25.400]  eat seaweeds. We're also going to dim the sun so you don't get enough sun for your crops.
[1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:31.440]  Total control. Now, they've moved on to the space angle of this, but it's the added
[1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:37.600]  barium salt, slimodoxide, and also radioactive isotopes to jet fuel and the patents that
[1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:41.840]  they won a Nobel Prize for in 92 or was it 93? They're aerosolized out and create the
[1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:48.880]  nuclei and create artificial clouds. So they're doing it with the jet companies. And it's
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:56.360]  just added to the major producers. It's not in all the jet fuel. So that's how it works.
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:59.600]  I know some of the mechanics are pissed off about it because since the start of the 90s,
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:05.040]  they noticed the rotors almost have problems. This also eats the jet engines. It caused
[1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:11.080]  a lot of engine problems. But they talk to you like you're a child. Oh, there's none
[1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:20.160]  of that going on even though now, oh, Bill Gates wants to control the sun. And imagine
[1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:26.160]  what would happen if Trump would have said this. They'd say, well, he's an evil super
[1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:30.080]  genius or he's Dr. Evil. He can't allow us to James Bond villain. But what they do is
[1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:33.760]  just another thing like, who's this Bill Gates? Oh, he's going to control your gut flora. He's
[1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:37.920]  going to control your body. He's going to make you take these shots that they didn't do testing
[1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:42.880]  of. And if you criticize it, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, they'll block you and say it's tested
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:47.080]  and shows it safe, including the woman who died a few days later. She said, I'm a young
[1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:50.760]  lady. I'm super sick. I feel like I'm dying. She died a few years the day later. The doctor
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:54.280]  said the vaccine probably killed her. But they went on her Facebook and said there's
[1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:59.040]  no proof of that. It's safe and was all tested and approved by the FDA, even though that's
[1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:06.640]  not true. So that's what big techs become is a lying murdering system to suppress us.
[1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:10.200]  Here's Tucker talking some about the plot to block out the son that we told you about
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:11.200]  20 years ago.
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:17.280]  I who made billions at a creating super clunky corporate software. What you didn't realize
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:21.600]  is that Bill Gates doesn't think of himself that way. Bill Gates doesn't think of himself
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:27.520]  as some guy who got super rich making bad software. Bill Gates thinks of himself as God in control
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:31.920]  of the solar system. And that's why Bill Gates is now backing something called sun dimming
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:37.080]  technology that would reflect sunlight out of the Earth's atmosphere causing global
[1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:38.080]  cooling.
[1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:44.080]  Ooh, that's not fraught with risks. You've got gain of function research on pathogens
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:48.960]  was dangerous. Try that. But that isn't stuff Harvard University. It's scientists are testing
[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:54.840]  that technology by spewing calcium carbonate dust into the atmosphere.
[1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:59.880]  Bill Gates is backing the first high altitude experiment of one radical climate change solution
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:04.920]  creating a massive chemical cloud that could cool the earth. It's called solar geoengineering
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:09.600]  and it's highly controversial. It would look something like this. Thousands of planes would
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:14.080]  fly very high and use nozzles to inject millions of tons of light reflecting particles into
[1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:18.280]  the stratosphere. It would create a thin chemical cloud of those particles around the whole
[1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:22.640]  planet blocking some sunlight from reaching the surface. It would mimic a giant volcanic
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:25.280]  eruption which we know cools the earth.
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:31.840]  Now just to restate, Bill Gates is not God. Bill Gates is some kind of weird socially awkward
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:37.720]  rich guy who lives in Seattle. He doesn't own the planet. But he's now changing the planet
[1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:41.680]  single-handedly. This is not just over his yard in Seattle. This is over his yard.
[1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:47.840]  Okay. The full report is at infowars.com and newswars.com. And obviously, I began covering
[1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:56.040]  what is known as the general tongue or nomenclature as chemtrails. But it's just geoengineering
[1:23:56.040 --> 1:23:59.880]  and it's done with the planes and it's out of the jet fuel just like NBC just showed
[1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:00.880]  you.
[1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:05.120]  But when NBC shows it to you, you know, it's a good thing. It's loving. Bill Gates is
[1:24:05.120 --> 1:24:08.120]  going to save you. When they have a matrix cartoon about it, you know, it's meant to
[1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:12.280]  kill the robots so they don't get solar power. But the reality is, is that these people just
[1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:14.640]  want to play God. They're already manipulating the weather. They're manipulating you through
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:18.160]  5G. They're manipulating you through all the GMO. They're manipulating you with these
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:23.280]  vaccines, which they admit are untested and very dangerous and have liability protection
[1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:24.280]  for.
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:28.440]  And so that's what they're doing. Meanwhile, we have the private federal reserve coming
[1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:32.080]  out saying they want world government to control everybody's bank accounts. We'll tell you
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:38.360]  about that after our next special guest joins us. He's the track coach that got fired for
[1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:43.160]  saying, yeah, we're not going to run in the track meets with these diapers over our faces
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:47.800]  to make somebody have their lung collapsed. We'll be right back on the other side, infowars.com.
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:51.200]  Tamara's News Today.
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:55.520]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health. It

[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:56.720]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit,
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:01.240]  do what you're told, and it's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarians, if
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:04.520]  you study the globalists, you'll understand that they reach a point where all the training
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:08.880]  is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved. And because
[1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:13.120]  the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:17.240]  they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:22.880]  third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:27.800]  such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:33.480]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:38.080]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:44.080]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:49.920]  get more IMF and World Bank money. And that's why we have to really get educated about the
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:51.920]  globalists.
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:27:01.440]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:09.160]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:16.200]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:23.240]  in males. Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:31.280]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives. Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom,
[1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:37.920]  combined with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the
[1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:44.040]  most out of this herb-packed formula. So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store.
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:53.920]  Never been a better time than right now. Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:27:53.920 --> 1:28:12.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:19.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:26.000]  so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:34.280]  Well, we've got a real thought criminal on with us. New Hampshire track coach says he
[1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:42.880]  was fired for violating school's massive mandate. Really, 15 days to cut the curve. Hospitals
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:47.080]  were all full. They weren't supposed to have millions and millions dead. It wasn't true.
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:51.000]  They countered all the other deaths. COVID and now they say the masks can never come
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:56.080]  off. And Klaus Schwab says this is about a carbon tax. This is about humans being bad.
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:02.520]  We need carbon lockdowns. So he himself has been a champion track guy and then went on
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:08.440]  to be a software developer, moved to New Hampshire with his family, wife and four daughters, 2005,
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:13.160]  started coaching at Penbrook Academy Public School three years ago. His youngest daughter
[1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:20.160]  was a freshman on the team. This would have been his fourth year, PATrackinField.com. Brad
[1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:28.560]  Keys is a thought criminal. And he joins us again via video Skype to talk about this
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:33.920]  and where this is all going. Thank you so much for coming on with us today, sir.
[1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:37.800]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on. I appreciate it.
[1:29:37.800 --> 1:29:42.200]  You've got the floor here. I mean, talk about why this doesn't make sense, why you did what
[1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:47.040]  you did. How people had lungs collapse, wearing these. This is just asinine. This is the NFL
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:53.480]  isn't wearing these. Even if you believe in the COVID hoax. What's really happening here?
[1:29:53.480 --> 1:30:00.000]  It makes absolutely no sense to me. Basically, three weeks ago, the NHIA, the governing body
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:04.920]  for sports in New Hampshire came out with their recommendations for spring sports.
[1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:15.040]  For track in particular, it was that all meets all races, students would be wearing masks.
[1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:18.920]  At first, a few coaches that I talked to said, hey, wait a minute, coaches didn't get to
[1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:25.800]  review this. Give us a little time. So I waited a little bit because I was absolutely floored.
[1:30:25.800 --> 1:30:30.320]  I couldn't believe they were going to make kids wear masks while racing. So week plus
[1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:35.960]  went by, got an email from my athletic director, said that here are the policies. I looked
[1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:43.080]  at them and nothing had changed. So I emailed them for confirmation. And I asked two questions.
[1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:47.280]  First of all, the policies said that this was recommended. So I asked whether it was
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:53.800]  truly recommended or required. And if it was required, if that meant that all races, all
[1:30:53.800 --> 1:30:59.280]  athletes from the 100 meter up to the two mile would be wearing masks in meets. And
[1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:03.880]  I got confirmation that, yes, it was required because our school and other schools in the
[1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:09.080]  area had accepted the recommendations. So they would be required. And that, yes, all
[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:15.280]  athletes would be wearing masks in all races. They did make some exceptions for field events,
[1:31:15.280 --> 1:31:21.360]  shot foot, discus, javelin, pole vault and hurdles for safety purposes. But apparently
[1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:24.560]  there are no safety issues with masks when you're running a two mile.
[1:31:24.560 --> 1:31:29.520]  Sure. They're using safety as a system of tyranny and oppression. And the more asinine
[1:31:29.520 --> 1:31:37.640]  they can make a submit to, the more rituals they can make us submit to the better. So
[1:31:37.640 --> 1:31:41.080]  roll through then what ended up happening to you and that moment of truth. But when
[1:31:41.080 --> 1:31:43.440]  you didn't comply with this idiocy.
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:50.160]  Sure. So again, I was bored. I slept on it. I decided right away. There was no way I
[1:31:50.160 --> 1:31:57.080]  was going to do that to my athletes. There was no way I was going to force them to restrict
[1:31:57.080 --> 1:32:04.720]  their breathing in events that are almost 100% reliant on aerobic capacity and oxygen
[1:32:04.720 --> 1:32:10.040]  intake for the longer distances. But I also wasn't going to stand up and lie to them.
[1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:13.360]  I wasn't going to tell them, oh, here are the new rules. They make sense. They're for
[1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:17.120]  your own good. There are reasons behind this.
[1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:20.480]  So at first I actually thought about quitting, but then I realized if I quit, they would
[1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.280]  have just said, oh, thank you and walked away and nothing would have happened. So I decided
[1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:33.200]  to write a letter, a very blatant letter that said, fire me if you must. And said I was
[1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:38.160]  not going to follow these mandates. I listed the reasons why and that it was up to them
[1:32:38.160 --> 1:32:43.880]  to do what they wanted to do. I sent that on Saturday. I got the response Monday morning
[1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:47.680]  that I had been fired.
[1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:52.200]  They love it. You know, I noticed that the flag is almost always at half mass now. It
[1:32:52.200 --> 1:32:55.720]  used to only happen like the president died or the challenger blew up and it meant something.
[1:32:55.720 --> 1:33:00.560]  The flag is almost always at half mass. We're told America sucks. Everybody's bad. You know,
[1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:05.120]  you've got men and women's sports now. It's just everything is like a bizarro world. It's
[1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:09.720]  like we woke up and set up a fantasy land. I mean, obviously all the studies show mass
[1:33:09.720 --> 1:33:15.120]  don't work. They don't protect you. It's a lie. But I mean, did you ask them when did
[1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:19.720]  the mass give her go away up 10 years, 100 years? CNN says they're like seat belts now.
[1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:22.280]  We should wear them forever.
[1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:26.640]  They won't answer any questions. And I, fortunately, I mean, the reason I did this was to get
[1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:30.760]  attention. There's no question and to make a point. Fortunately, it's taken off. It's
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:37.160]  gone from local to national, regional to national. We have petitions being signed. I've got
[1:33:37.160 --> 1:33:43.240]  students on the team, putting petitions out to other teams trying to get students to sign.
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:44.760]  I've got parents that are.
[1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:49.360]  Oh, yeah, this is as dumb as having men compete in women's sports. I mean, this is, this is
[1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:52.400]  so, so, so major oppositions forming. Tell us about that.
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:34:02.120]  Yeah, we've got parents emailing and asking very specific questions of the NHIA. The CDC
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:08.040]  guidelines and the guidelines both state you should not wear masks during exercise. Yet
[1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:17.600]  somehow the NHIA NHIA has decided that masks for all spring sports will be worn practices
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:23.560]  and competitions. Tennis that you want to even get more ridiculous. Single tennis, tennis
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:27.000]  courts, you're 30 to 60 feet away from everybody else.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:32.960]  Let me clear. NPR now says wear a mask permanently. I mean, this is a, what do you think's behind
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:38.320]  all this? I mean, I know what it is, but what's your view on it?
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:43.680]  It's bureaucratic covering their butts. They want to say they've done something. So if anyone
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:46.120]  gets sick, it's not their fault.
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:50.640]  Exactly. It's lawyers that got rid of diving boards and then playgrounds and jungle gyms.
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:54.400]  And now all new pools are like two and a half feet deep because, oh, a deeper one somebody
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:58.360]  could die in the deep end. I mean, this is the nanny state taking over.
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:04.120]  Yes. And in my original email, I talked about the fact that I do think there are health concerns
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:07.480]  with wearing masks when you're running. And I kind of downplayed it. But the more I think
[1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:11.840]  about it, I'm getting a little more concerned about it. We do have kids with asthma. We
[1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:16.560]  have kids with heart conditions, but I actually went out on the track and I put a mask on
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:23.400]  and I ran a 200 meter and a 400 meter race relatively fast to find out what it really
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:24.400]  felt like.
[1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:29.600]  I've run all these events. I know what they feel like. The 400 meters is absolutely miserable.
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:37.000]  With the mask on, once you start hitting the point where you're relying strictly on oxygen,
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:42.640]  you start breathing heavily. You're sucking the mask into your mouth and your nose every
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:46.480]  time you breathe. It seals around your face.
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:50.160]  You're basically being waterborne. Explain that. There's spit. There's mucus. I've tried
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:54.240]  it as well. Not that I'm a great jogger, but I did it. I almost fell over. I can run a
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:58.680]  mile if I need to. I'm a big guy, but I can do it. I tried to run a mile on this, a quarter
[1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:03.680]  mile into it. I was just like snot was coming on. My face was wet. Is that what you're talking
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:04.680]  about?
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:09.200]  Yes. It's insane. The only way air... I mean, those masks are designed for airflow around
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:13.120]  the edges. You suck it into your face and there is nothing around the edges. Everything
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:18.080]  has to come through the fabric, which got me thinking about what's coming off that fabric
[1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:21.840]  and being breathed into your lungs over and over again. And you're talking about kids
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:27.240]  who are outside with masks on, exercising two hours a day, five, six days a week.
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:30.840]  Well, the study show, it's a major league link to bacterial pneumonia, but you've really
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:34.320]  done your research, sir. When we come back, I mean, let's talk about this and where this
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:38.440]  is going. We should all stand up. We should all say, no, I know a lot of tract operations
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:42.600]  aren't doing this. We can also ask the question, why is it happening so much in New Hampshire?
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:46.280]  But you're backed up, sir, by the medical stuff. Mainline medical sites say you should
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:50.680]  not run with a mask on your face before the fake pandemic and after. Why do you think
[1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:56.360]  they're doing this? This is a real medical issue versus the COVID hoax.
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:01.120]  I don't think they're thinking. There is no rational reason. And I really would like to
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:05.600]  see the answer from the medical committee that has proved these as to what they thought
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:08.200]  they were preventing and why.
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:12.400]  Absolutely. How do people find you that want to bypass the Main Street media and actually
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:18.040]  hear what a great leader and a patriot you are leader Brad Keys? How do people find you?
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:25.400]  I've got a website, EA, trackandfield.com. I've got a timeline there. I have the letters
[1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:31.320]  there. I also have a mailing list you can sign up for. I'll send out periodic emails
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:35.160]  just listing what's going on. Beautiful, beautiful, because you're on the front lines of ending
[1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:41.320]  this lockdown, of ending this medical legal power grab. We'll talk to Brad Keys of PA,
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:46.760]  trackandfield.com, share that link. We're all Brad Keys now. We've all got to stand
[1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:50.120]  up and say, no, lost his job over this. I respect that.
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:55.040]  It's very simple. Every household, not just in America, but worldwide, should be taking
[1:37:55.040 --> 1:38:00.040]  a high quality multivitamin mineral every single day. But so many of the big brands

[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:54.040]  like to lecture people. I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist and their
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:58.800]  attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and we've
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:03.520]  given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God. And I know some
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:06.600]  of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break. The
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:10.880]  Satanism's out in the open. I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:14.320]  fight between good and evil is so clear, and I get it. A lot of you've been turned off
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:19.440]  by big churches. A lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system, and
[1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:24.720]  I get it, me too. Believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship with God and just
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:30.880]  God's universe that God created that is so essential. And God created the universe for
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:34.800]  us to have communion with God through and to have life. And so that's what infowar is
[1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:38.160]  really all about. So thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank you for spreading the
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:42.720]  word about infowar. And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infowarstore.com.

[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:57.760]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media. They control big pharma.
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:04.880]  They control academia. They control the military, industrial complex. They control big tech.
[1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:09.400]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:17.280]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization. It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:21.600]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:28.000]  them. So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:35.440]  down and used the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:39.960]  that threatens their monopoly and control. That's why they target info wars because we
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:44.400]  understand the keys to defeating them. But the only way our transmission gets out is
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:49.680]  if you promote info wars and ban that video. So redouble your efforts. We're all in this
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:50.680]  together.
[1:40:50.680 --> 1:40:56.000]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones are
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:01.840]  an amazing tool. Really, they're a super computer that's handheld. But big tech, large corporations,
[1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:06.680]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially, are using this to
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:11.520]  steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:16.120]  scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:22.920]  happen in mass movements. Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:28.200]  their AI takeover. In their own words, they admit it. So I've been selling privacy pouches
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:31.840]  and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade. And now the units have
[1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:35.760]  gotten really lightweight. They're Faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope.
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:40.400]  They work absolutely great. And it just gives you that security to have power over your
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:44.920]  data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:54.880]  know what you're up to because it's not their business. Get yours at mforestore.com today.
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:42:20.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:49.320]  You know, everybody always fetishizes the U.S. military and U.S. intelligence and all
[1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:53.600]  that Q stuff. But I told you, we have all the real sources of the U.S. military and
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:59.120]  U.S. intelligence. And they are patriots and they're aware of the globalist takeover and
[1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:05.120]  they understand that this lockdown, this COVID system is an excuse for tyranny, a global
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:11.360]  ID, ZZ ping, announcing a global QR code, Fauci saying we should adopt it, and corporate
[1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:15.880]  media trying to block everyone who challenges anything they say. Governor DeSantis had a
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:22.360]  round table two hours long at the legislature in a committee hearing with doctors giving
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:26.800]  different perspectives and a several prestigious ones said they counted all these other deaths
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:32.240]  as COVID. We have the same number of deaths roughly in 2020 as we had in 2019. This is
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:36.800]  hiked up, herd immunity is the answer, vitamin D is the answer. That's why Florida has one
[1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:43.320]  of the lowest problems, lowest rates. And YouTube said that challenges the U.N. They
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:47.440]  are the only authority that can talk about this. How do we wake up in this world? It
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:51.520]  had over 4 million, 5 million views. When I was taking off YouTube, we just posted it
[1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:56.560]  to band.video in the most banned video section. See the censored governor Ron DeSantis public
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:44:01.840]  health round table discussion in Tallahassee. So going back to our guest, Brad Teese, who
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:06.720]  really is a hero. You know, he's got a private business. He's a track coach. His daughters
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:12.040]  go there. It's how he makes part of his living. He lids his passion. He's got a website about
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:17.160]  track and field. He's a champion track guy. I've got his record right here. And he's
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:23.080]  been treated like a bad person when some group makes a recommendation. Who is the group that
[1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:29.680]  makes this recommendation in New Hampshire and other areas? And why does it vary jurisdiction
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:38.480]  to jurisdiction? The group is the NHIA. I guess over time they've evolved into setting
[1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:44.720]  policy or they don't set policy. They recommend to the schools. And then it's up to the schools
[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:50.520]  as to whether they accept it or not. And as far as I know, every school in New Hampshire
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:54.480]  has accepted these recommendations. I haven't heard of an exception yet. I've asked people
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:45:01.000]  to tell me if there is one. And I don't even know who at the school exactly accepts them.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:04.600]  Whether it's the athletic director, whether it's athletic director combined with school
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:09.560]  or... So some nebulous group as usual. It all basically comes down from the UN. And you're
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:13.000]  not supposed to have your own opinion. I suppose in an independent school district, whether
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:16.720]  it's Texas or New Hampshire, I mean, isn't it the coaches? Isn't it the families that
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:20.640]  should have come together and made a decision? I mean, if the PTA voted to make children wear
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.520]  a mask or young people, I mean, I'd say, well, they are their parents. It's still weird,
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:30.160]  you know, like saying you can't dance or go to hell or something. But still, that would
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:35.160]  be better, wouldn't it, instead of just some nebulous group? Coaches were not consulted.
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:41.160]  We were simply informed. These are the rules. Okay. Well, I've got a lot of questions, but
[1:45:41.160 --> 1:45:44.560]  I'd like you to have the floor here for whatever you'd like to tell the viewers and listeners,
[1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:51.880]  my friend. I mean, the main point for me is I want these mask mandates gone. They're potentially
[1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:58.120]  very damaging health wise. Even if you ignore that, they make no sense. They restrict training.
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:03.160]  They're going to restrict performance. The kids don't deserve it. Not just track and
[1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:09.040]  field, any of them. All the outdoor sports should have all the masks removed while they're
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:15.720]  playing. There's no reason for it. The only sport that should have a mask is scuba. We
[1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:20.400]  don't have that here. Or fencing or fencing. I know I'm being sarcastic. No, fencing, that's
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:26.640]  a good point. But fencing has very big holes. No, that's the whole point. I mean, the main
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:31.360]  point is if they need to be gone, there's nothing behind it. And people are starting
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:35.920]  to stand up. I was hoping this might spark some interest. It sparked a lot more than
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:41.240]  I expected, which is great. And there are a lot of other people now starting to push.
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:45.160]  They're starting to ask questions. And quite frankly, and I've asked them demand answers.
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:49.800]  These people are supposedly public servants. They're supposedly making decisions for our
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:55.240]  children's welfare. They should at least be able to stand up and say why they made these
[1:46:55.240 --> 1:46:59.440]  decisions. And first, I guess, who actually made the decisions?
[1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:03.600]  Well, talking about education in general, Bill Gates wants to get rid of the Department
[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:09.800]  of Education. He wants to get rid of the student unions. That sounds reasonable on the surface.
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:14.600]  And I think they're out of control in arrogant groups. But by them saying, let's all work
[1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:18.480]  from home. By them saying, oh, we're just people's babysitters. Keep your kids. They're
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:23.400]  being made obsolete like fools. And I even know trying to get my youngest daughter into
[1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:27.720]  some type of preschool, she's not even four yet. They go, oh, at any of these schools,
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:31.480]  even high end ones, you don't get to come and see the school. You don't even come inside.
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:35.160]  So it's really a cultic. The hospitals, you can't see your family. You can't see your
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:40.160]  old folks. You can't see your children. Doesn't everybody see this is a very authoritarian,
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:46.320]  creepy cult takeover? Yeah. And I think, I mean, the direction I'm
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:51.840]  going as far as the longer term solution is to offer alternatives. I've already talked
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:56.720]  to several other people around the state who have set up things like flag football leagues
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:00.360]  and others that are private to give people options. And that's where I'm going. I'm
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:05.320]  going to set up a private track and field club. It'll be open to anybody all ages, high
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:08.720]  school, elementary. Oh, that's beautiful. Something tells me it's going to become a
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:16.040]  lot more popular than their cult. Yes. And it'll be open to everyone. It'll be flexible
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:21.640]  and it'll offer some, some alternative, some other option. And I think that long term,
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:23.880]  that's what's really needed. I would do this just to shut the dirty
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:28.440]  lawyers down. They're taking over our society consciously. I'd have a waiver saying I'm
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:32.400]  a free human. I believe in my immune system and I wash my hands and I'm going to, you
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:37.880]  know, I'm taking responsibility for myself and I waive all liability. Yes. That's what
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:40.960]  I would like to do. And that's definitely the direction I'm going. I'm already looking
[1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:45.320]  at land. I have most of the equipment, including a poleball pit. So I'm just going to start
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:48.960]  with what I've got and I'm going to grow it. I have a bunch of ideas and I've got some
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:53.280]  interests now and I have the time and the resources to do it also. So that's, that's
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:49:00.080]  where I'm headed. Beautiful. I'm just so glad you're doing this. I'm also seeing other
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:05.600]  people are bucking the system as well. Oh yeah. There are a lot of people out there.
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:10.440]  I've gotten in the last five days, I've gotten over a hundred unsolicited emails from people
[1:49:10.440 --> 1:49:16.680]  all over the country now. Some from, I've gotten UK, Canada, a woman called me on the
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:22.160]  phone from Spain to say thank you. There are a tremendous number of people out there who
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:30.440]  are tired of it and who are looking for something to stand behind. So I think the more people
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:35.200]  who stand up and speak, and that's what I'm telling everyone, just say something to the
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:41.920]  administration, bureaucrats, politicians, school boards, whoever, they need to hear it
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:46.640]  because if they don't hear it, they just keep doing what they've been doing.
[1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:50.000]  And then it's whoever bitches and complains, whether it's the people that want men and
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.920]  women's sports or whether it's drag queen story time that wants convicted pedophiles
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:59.160]  of access to our children. I mean, at a certain point, we've just got to say no to the madness.
[1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:04.040]  All right. Well, Brad Keys, thank you so much, PA, trackandfield.com. Anything else you'd
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:07.800]  like to add? No, I just appreciate being on and message
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:12.000]  to everybody wherever you are, whether you're in New Hampshire or not. If you see anything
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.720]  like this, start talking, start speaking out, start complaining and gather other people
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:20.600]  who think the same way. Well, I mean, listen, I'm not somebody that's
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:24.440]  big on getting people to leave churches or leave athletic events or whatever. We need
[1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:27.200]  to start using our power. We need to do it because there's always the left trying to
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:31.680]  control things by boycotts. But they started this. I think people out of boycott the track
[1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:35.720]  and field program there or anything. But let me guess, they're telling basketball players
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:41.200]  to wear a mask. How are football players going to wear a mask? It's just it's asinine. No,
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:46.280]  they're doing that in the problem with the boycott. And I've had parents ask me, should
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:52.480]  I pull my kids? And it's a very hard question because a track and field in high school sports
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:59.600]  can be a fantastic experience. And does pulling one or two kids help anyone? And it certainly
[1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:04.080]  hurts the child. But yes, at some point, I think it needs to be considered. And everybody's
[1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:09.120]  going to have to make their own choices on that. But if they're alternatives, then people
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:13.640]  might start doing it because then the child still has something to do.
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:18.560]  Well, God bless you and God bless Tom Brady doing the same thing. We've got a lead by
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:23.640]  example. Brad T's PA Track and Field dot com. Everybody should support you. God bless.
[1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:27.120]  Thank you very much. I appreciate you not. Thank you. Well, that guy's the model of the
[1:51:27.120 --> 1:51:30.560]  future starts saying no, put your money where your mouth goes. We salute him. And he's not
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:35.200]  just getting fired. He's starting his new thing to counter these monsters. Next like
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:38.160]  Canada will probably try to put a fence up around his property and say he can't even
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:42.320]  have a little running. But that's okay. We forced them to show how ass and out of control
[1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:46.240]  they are. All right, I'm really frustrated today because I got a bunch of stuff I want
[1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:50.960]  to cover. And we got another big guest coming up, but I do have 30 minutes. And so I'm going
[1:51:50.960 --> 1:51:56.240]  to do my best to get to the news on so many fronts and on the human smuggling when we
[1:51:56.240 --> 1:52:01.840]  come back. Because if you think the stuff we released a few days ago, it's a top was
[1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:09.320]  top of Twitter yesterday. I mean, if you think or excuse me on Wednesday, if you think that
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:17.600]  was big, we have hours of footage so horrible. So insane. But I can't even hardly do my show
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:23.800]  because it's like I've got I've got crimes on video and I'm going to go to Texas Rangers.
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:28.080]  I mean, where are they? We found this instantly. They all know governor knows about it. He said
[1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:31.160]  it's going on. So what's going to happen? And then there's the money issue. All right,
[1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:35.800]  it's just better than ever. But that war capital ain't coming in. So get in there and buy products
[1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:42.040]  and info or store.com and be part of the winning team. I'm going to say it again. I am not

[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:50.040]  I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:53.840]  that has come together over the years. It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed
[1:53:53.840 --> 1:53:57.800]  and thankful for all of you. The listeners of this show, I want you to know that I love
[1:53:57.800 --> 1:54:02.200]  you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black,
[1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:06.600]  it doesn't matter. You got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:11.440]  our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together. And it has just been an
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:16.040]  incredible experience to work with you over the years. And it's crazier. Things are, I
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:21.160]  want to keep working into the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:25.760]  So please, I hope God works through you and put some message in your heart and support
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:30.120]  us. Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for
[1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:34.280]  the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again to pray
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:38.560]  to God and ask what God's vision is for you. And hopefully God will touch your heart to
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:44.440]  continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[1:54:44.440 --> 1:55:07.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show about to air a special report by John Brown and T-minus
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:15.800]  45 seconds. It's a band video on the John Brown section. It's important. The world war on faith.
[1:55:15.800 --> 1:55:20.880]  And then I always butcher the beautiful language of Spanish and other romantic languages like
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:28.800]  Latin, Italian and Portuguese. I guess it's a mix of other language, Germanic and Romantic.
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:35.560]  But it's the saint of death, holy death, Sente Muerte. But I'm sure I said that wrong. We'll
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:41.560]  tell you all about that smuggling kids on the other side of this report. And we'll premiere
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:46.120]  this bombshell report that is about to go live at band.video that is going to make the
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:56:15.920]  global's really unhappy.
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:24.320]  It's nothing new. Christianity is under attack worldwide, from North Korea to Yemen to China
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:30.400]  to Somalia. Alarmingly, the persecution of Christians is exponentially getting more severe
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:35.600]  than ever. The number of Christians facing extreme levels of persecution for their faith
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:43.160]  rose from 245 million to 260 million last year in the top 50 countries on the world
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:50.800]  watch list. Of the top 50, 45 countries have been designated extreme or very high in terms
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:57.000]  of the levels of persecution Christians face. That's five more countries than the previous
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:03.600]  here. Attacks against churches have risen 500 percent. On average, 13 Christians are
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:09.480]  killed every day because of their faith. And speaking of faith, overall, Americans' membership
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:15.320]  in houses of worship continued to decline last year, dropping below 50 percent for the
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:22.280]  first time in a Gallup poll's eight decade trend. In 2020, 47 percent of Americans said
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:28.960]  they belonged to a church, synagogue or mosque down from 50 percent in 2018 and 70 percent
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:35.320]  in 1999. Many believe it's hard core not to be a Christian, but Christianity was punk
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:42.080]  rock 2,021 years before the first poser tricked out their Mohawk. Christianity at its core
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:47.600]  is persecution, persecution of the truth, and that persecution of the truth is the heart
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:54.000]  and soul of the Bill of Rights. It is the lifeblood of freedom, and totalitarianism despises
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:58:08.680]  it. Do not come back without the warrants. You understand that? You're not welcome here.
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:16.120]  Nazis are not welcome here. Gestapo is not welcome here. Do not come back, you Nazi psychopaths.
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:27.520]  Unbelievable, sick, evil people. Intimidating people in a church during the Passover. You
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:35.920]  Gestapo Nazi communists, fascists. Don't you dare coming back here.
[1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:43.600]  The pandemic has resulted in previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty. Now, notice
[1:58:43.600 --> 1:58:50.000]  what I am not saying or even implying. I am not diminishing the severity of the virus's
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:55.360]  threat to public health and putting aside what I will say shortly about a few Supreme
[1:58:55.360 --> 1:59:02.000]  Court cases. I'm not saying anything about the legality of COVID restrictions, nor am
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:07.200]  I saying anything about whether any of these restrictions represent good public policy.
[1:59:07.200 --> 1:59:13.720]  I'm a judge, not a policymaker. All that I'm saying is this, and I think it is an indisputable
[1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:22.360]  statement of fact. We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged
[1:59:22.360 --> 1:59:27.960]  as those experienced for most of 2020. Those at odds with the message of Jesus
[1:59:27.960 --> 1:59:33.640]  of Nazareth, whether through deception or outright violence, pretend to be strong, but without
[1:59:33.640 --> 1:59:38.920]  the truth, they are incredibly feeble. It takes a strong heart and soul to endure the
[1:59:38.920 --> 1:59:44.240]  persecution and fight for the freedom that is slipping right out of our hands. John
[1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:45.240]  Bown reporting.
[1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:54.080]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so, as bad as things are
[1:59:54.080 --> 1:59:57.560]  with the globalist attack on humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[1:59:57.560 --> 2:00:03.840]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure,
[2:00:03.840 --> 2:00:07.280]  so I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's
[2:00:07.280 --> 2:00:13.400]  police chiefs or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:18.960]  industry, people are really, really away from the establishment. They don't want to go along
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:23.480]  with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership. Well, that's where
[2:00:23.480 --> 2:00:29.440]  M4 comes in. You fund us, you support M4Store.com, you get great products at the same time.
[2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:34.400]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target
[2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:39.240]  you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's
[2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:44.880]  our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock
[2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:59.000]  groups for the information war. Fund us at M4Store.com.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:26.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back. We are broadcasting worldwide. All right, I'm going
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:32.600]  to premiere a very important special report at the start of the next segment. We are visually
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:38.120]  right now uploading it to BandThis.tv, also known as Band.Video, but if you try to share
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:44.600]  Band.Video on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook, big tech that's busy covering up all the child
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:49.800]  smuggling and all the criminal activity will block it. That's why we create a new URL every
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:54.320]  time they ban another URL that takes you to the same site, the same subpages. It just
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:58.840]  creates new links for you. They go to the exact same reports, and right now that link
[2:01:58.840 --> 2:02:18.200]  you can share is BandThis.tv. BandThis.tv. So that is coming up, start of the next segment.
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:23.520]  And again, if you thought what you saw two days ago that became the number one story
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:35.160]  on Twitter and got tens of millions of views, you ain't seen nothing yet. I mean, yes, it's
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:42.760]  dramatic footage coming up to the child smuggling center. They call a Catholic charity, but
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:46.760]  Biden has waived the law outside of an executive order or outside of law. I don't care if
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:49.840]  they change the law and say you can smuggle kids, I'm against it. You can pass a law saying
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:52.800]  black people are slaves again. I'm not going to say I agree with that law. You can pass
[2:02:52.800 --> 2:02:56.080]  a law saying you're going to execute people for their religious faith. I don't support
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:01.000]  that and I'll fight you. But they are also confident they're hiding in plain view smuggled
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:05.800]  children, sometimes not even with their parents, no background checks on who gets them, and
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:11.160]  then people with gang MS-13 tattoos on them, literally with other people's children putting
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:18.480]  them on trains and on buses and on planes, we have the footage inside. I left Tuesday,
[2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:21.760]  the crew shot that on Wednesday, didn't even tell me. They're like, oh, we're getting a
[2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:28.040]  few reports to go this morning. I started watching and going, what the hell is this?
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:34.920]  So that's going to go live the next 10 minutes of Band-Aid video as the featured video. And
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:37.120]  we've been working on this all morning. We're going to put it out for you, but we'll have
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:41.240]  a lot more done because there's hours and hours and this is going to get even worse.
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:44.840]  They're basically having like auctions and like so-called liberals come in as like a
[2:03:44.840 --> 2:03:48.960]  dude going, I want that woman. I want that woman. And this is all on video. And we're
[2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:55.120]  like, they're letting us see this because again, they're smart. They hide it all in
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:58.840]  plain view. So when people see this, they're going to think it's fake, even though it's
[2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:02.120]  none of it's fake. It's like, well, this can't be going on. I mean, they're not stuffing
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:07.080]  three kids in the trunk of a car. I mean, Jones, obviously, you can't fake that. Yeah,
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:16.000]  yeah, yeah. Like when I had Marines in 1999, training to confiscate guns with roleplayers
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:19.880]  they hired who were actors saying, please don't take my guns on American citizen and
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:25.160]  the Marines would execute them. That was under Clinton. It was the Marines coldest this was
[2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:31.280]  coming up. They were the ones with the whistle. People thought that was fake footage because
[2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:36.280]  oh, there's no way the Marines are trying to take our guns. Well, it's the same type
[2:04:36.280 --> 2:04:41.520]  of stuff coming up right now. But let's let's let's hit this now because it's the anatomy
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:47.600]  of control. It's the anatomy of manipulation. Here's Snopes funded by George Soros and others.
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:51.760]  Did Alex Jones stop smugglers from illegally transporting children at the border? Well,
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:58.320]  Snopes says no. And they go on to say, well, it was children being saved by a Catholic
[2:04:58.320 --> 2:05:02.080]  charity and yes, they were being put in the trunk of a car, but that's okay because we
[2:05:02.080 --> 2:05:05.720]  don't call that smuggling even though they weren't tracked. They weren't traced. The
[2:05:05.720 --> 2:05:14.640]  borders were left wide open and they were just let in. So it's it's again, their opinion.
[2:05:14.640 --> 2:05:20.080]  And I love how the so-called Catholic charity that's literally like a communist globalist
[2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:25.280]  pro cartel organization, we got all that right here, came out in the press and he said, well,
[2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:30.200]  Jones did stage it the way he covered it. I mean, it was real people, but he still they
[2:05:30.200 --> 2:05:33.480]  love that word. Oh, it was staged. Oh, yeah, I'm the one that stage the stuff. No, I think
[2:05:33.480 --> 2:05:40.040]  you're thinking about somebody, somebody else. Here's his other headline. Did Alex Jones
[2:05:40.040 --> 2:05:47.160]  really rescue kids being smuggled in an adult camera crew and calls the scene staged? And
[2:05:47.160 --> 2:05:52.600]  even after the Catholic charities came out and said, no, it's real video. They still
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:56.800]  say I staged it. Video of Alex Jones stopping car illegally transporting children viewed
[2:05:56.800 --> 2:06:03.280]  one million times this week. Alex Jones stopped smugglers from kidnapping migrant children.
[2:06:03.280 --> 2:06:08.520]  Video shows him jumping in front of car international business times.
[2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:14.560]  Alex Jones really rescue kids. There's some people on Twitter. Let's remember Alex Jones
[2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:20.560]  admitted in court. He was nothing but a performer. Really show me that video. Show me the text
[2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:29.280]  of that. You guys always say that, but I never said that. I never said that. But you always
[2:06:29.280 --> 2:06:37.520]  just say it. Okay. And of course, all these locals now are on the news going, no, no,
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:40.880]  this happens all day long. We saw Alex Jones do it. I mean, it's a busy middle of downtown
[2:06:40.880 --> 2:06:46.360]  in McAllen where this happened. It's all real. Everybody knows it was other journalists
[2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:54.720]  there that saw it. But that's how they operate. That's how they deceive. But I have a whole
[2:06:54.720 --> 2:06:59.640]  stack here with the Texas Rangers and the governor saying there's massive human trafficking
[2:06:59.640 --> 2:07:05.120]  including sex slavery of little children going on in these federal facilities and that most
[2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:09.120]  of people aren't even taking to federal facilities. They're released directly to the Catholic
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:15.880]  charity or Democrat party groups who literally then have these men showing up saying I want
[2:07:15.880 --> 2:07:19.960]  those. I want that one. They have orders for a baby and then this baby just gets loaded
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:25.880]  up and disappeared somewhere. No wonder the Russians 10 years ago, put me that article
[2:07:25.880 --> 2:07:30.400]  too guys, so you showed earlier, banned the U.S. getting babies. They said that they were
[2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:34.760]  selling babies for sex and selling babies to other people. And of course, it turned
[2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:42.200]  out it was true because Americans have become incredibly naive about how much evil is taking
[2:07:42.200 --> 2:07:50.320]  place and what is going on. But the really big news I haven't covered yet and I'm going
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:54.880]  to read it tomorrow on air commercial free and it's the statement by the former Pfizer
[2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:59.640]  chief scientist saying that this is a bio-weapon to depopulate people and laying out all the
[2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:03.920]  evidence. He says at the end of the article, the end of the transcript, he says they're
[2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:07.520]  literally going to kill you and your family. That's what I always say, but that's what's
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:11.160]  going on. I mean, this has been the shutdown society. This has been to make everything
[2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:18.560]  collapse. You are obsolete, you are non-essential. This is just the beginning, not the end.
[2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:23.480]  And the sooner we wake up and say no, the better. But only admitting how bad it is,
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:30.160]  what we're being hit with gives us any chance of turning it around. Now, let me hit this
[2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:36.240]  for you because it's very, very important. I don't have the money in the budget to send
[2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:45.600]  10 people down to the border Monday or Sunday, but I'm going to do it. And I don't have the
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:48.960]  budget into the future to keep supporting some of the journalists and groups out there
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:54.160]  that wouldn't be on air wasn't for us helping. I just can't watch them go off air. I don't
[2:08:54.160 --> 2:08:58.360]  even say who the groups are, some of the groups we fund. You tell you, you understand. We
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:03.480]  do a lot here, you see, we do a lot behind the scenes. And so I just want to ask listeners
[2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:07.480]  to understand the fact that if Info Wars wasn't here, we'd be in the trouble. You've seen
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:11.720]  General Flynn indoors, our spars report, you've seen everything we do constantly, and it's
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:15.760]  like, guys, God is with us and you are with us. But we're not bringing in enough funds
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:20.680]  right now to be in six months, still being able to operate with even the crew we have
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:25.720]  now. So I need you to just say, hey, I'm going InfoWarsTour.com. And if you go to InfoWarsTour.com,
[2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:29.080]  there's a link up there. We make it hard to donate still. I don't know why, but it says
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:35.840]  a support link up there. And you can see $5, $10, $100. It's right there on the side
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:42.800]  of the support us. Click on that link for me, for TV viewers. And if you go there, you
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:49.200]  can sponsor us with a recurring donation, or you can do a one-time donation. And that
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:55.120]  way, we get 95% of the money you donate. You have to pay 5% processing fees as they
[2:09:55.120 --> 2:09:59.000]  took our regular processors away with all the harassment. But that's how we fund our
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:13.360]  operation. So please go to InfoWarsTour.com and click on the support InfoWars link and
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:18.880]  make a $5, $10, $100 donation, or sign up for a recurring donation right there on the

[2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:51.520]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Can't love it
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:55.680]  on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you,
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:10:59.720]  the New World Order is breathing down our neck. The big, globalist publications are
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:03.560]  coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:08.000]  keep InfoWars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.

[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:23.520]  in the face of this thing. I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting

[2:12:50.560 --> 2:13:08.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:16.600]  Santé Warte. I was about to talk about the Angel of Death or the Holy Death, and they
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:20.420]  have kind of an auto-play stuff, and this song, it airs once a month, going through the
[2:13:20.420 --> 2:13:26.840]  Reaper starts playing. But since the mid-1990s, certainly the MS-13 out of Central America,
[2:13:26.840 --> 2:13:33.200]  it's been adopted by a lot of the other Mexican drug cartels to have Santé Warte tattoos
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:37.480]  all over themselves, particular ones to say what cartel they're in, and different cartels
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:41.760]  have a different version. One cartel has a male version, most of the others are the
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:47.360]  female version, though in the Bible the Angel of Death does not have a sex, but it's sent
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:51.480]  in, the Israelites put blood over their doors, and then the Angel of Death goes in and kills
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:56.520]  the firstborn of Egypt, because Pharaoh's father had killed the firstborn of the Israelites,
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:13:58.920]  and they made a great Metallica song out of that too.
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:04.720]  But the reason I raise that is, here's the nun, the sister from this leftist communist
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:08.560]  group that we've looked up that runs this big center, just one of hundreds of these on
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:16.640]  the border, not even singling them out, Catholic Charities that loads these children onto the
[2:14:16.640 --> 2:14:21.600]  buses, onto the planes that are flown out. So here's your Wikipedia about it, and they
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:26.600]  admit that this is the main patron saint of MS-13, and the drug cartels. Well, it turns
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:31.320]  out the nun that we had at the center, we videotaped her there, followed her, this is
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:34.960]  Wednesday, we just down, crew got back, got the video, we're preparing it here, just went
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:41.880]  live minutes ago, I'm told, it banned off video, and they follow her to the facility,
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:46.120]  because we sent in a Spanish-speaking woman, I'll leave it at that, we infiltrated, and
[2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:50.320]  she interviewed a bunch of women, and they said, help us, we paid a lot of money to get
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:55.480]  here, and we're supposed to meet our husbands, but they took our phones away and said they
[2:14:55.480 --> 2:14:59.920]  don't work here, but they do work here, and I'm supposed to meet my husband, but they're
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:04.920]  sending me somewhere else, help me, help me, I mean, this is the kind of stuff going on,
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:12.120]  and they're sending me somewhere else than what they told me. Well, while we'd been there
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:18.800]  earlier, we saw men, and some of this is on video, coming up and saying, I want her and
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:23.560]  I want her, and then even talking to our crew going, hey, you know, they're coming here,
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:29.720]  might as well, and just flying back to the east coast, so this is like a vegetable stand,
[2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:35.240]  you see, almost out of the road, but it's women and children, and so then the nun from
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:39.040]  the facility where you see him cramming the kids in the back of the trunk, and that big
[2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:45.240]  national story, I fly out that evening, literally, an hour later, I flew out, the crew stays
[2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:50.680]  on another day, and this happens the next day, they go to the airport, and by the way,
[2:15:50.680 --> 2:15:55.120]  we got hours of this, this is just one, one little three-minute clip that we got out of
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:15:58.600]  all this, but let me show you an overhead shot for TV viewers, because the media is
[2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:04.320]  spitting this, like, oh, Jones claims it was human smuggling, but it's totally legal, that
[2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:08.400]  they're loading women and children into the backs of vans and cars and planes, no, no
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:12.720]  one knows who they are, they have no ID, it's all waived, the Catholic charity takes her
[2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:17.320]  phones away, they're scared, they're telling Spanish-speaking women, they're in law enforcement,
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:22.120]  I'll leave it at that, that we've sent in, because local cops want to work with us folks,
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:26.400]  and so do the feds, they're pissed, nobody else will do anything, so where they're
[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:30.800]  filling the vacuum, and that's the thing, we're down there a few days and have all
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:34.840]  this, this is insane, and the left's like, how are they getting all this footage, because
[2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:39.240]  you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit smuggling, and most of it's children,
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:44.280]  and so then this woman walks in in Spanish and tells the airport, whether they're directing
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:51.840]  this train of humanity, of slavery, oh, it's my baby, she says in Spanish, when we have
[2:16:51.840 --> 2:16:57.040]  her 20 minutes before at the facility getting the baby from the woman, so we have, let me
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:02.160]  say this again, we have babies being separated from their mothers, did they buy the baby,
[2:17:02.160 --> 2:17:10.280]  we don't know, we're asking these people, so this is like a year old baby, maybe a year,
[2:17:10.280 --> 2:17:16.440]  looks like about 10, 11 months, such cute little babies, and this is just one clip of
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:22.240]  hours we have, and what's insane is, all of it's this bad, you wanna talk about, I feel
[2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:26.240]  so sorry for cops that have to watch like real stuff films, and you know, like psychos,
[2:17:26.240 --> 2:17:29.240]  videotape, portraying people, and like, you hear about the cops have trouble watching
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:33.920]  it, I have trouble watching this, ladies and gentlemen, I literally am a tough guy, but
[2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:38.240]  this is, because also it pisses me off, how is this just going on in plain view, there's
[2:17:38.240 --> 2:17:45.640]  some of the headlines, AP, US waves, FBI checks on caregivers at new migrant facilities, AP,
[2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:49.880]  Biden just said, he's a dictator, see so they can have these criminals doing this, migrants
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:56.000]  free without court notice, sometimes no paperwork, 130 illegal surrendered Arizona bar patrols,
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:18:00.160]  latest photo, this is what I'm saying, and then they have scopes going, Biden says they're
[2:18:00.160 --> 2:18:04.960]  legal, he told them come, so they're legal, here, ladies and gentlemen, is just three
[2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:11.000]  minutes, we're gonna show you potentially hours of this tomorrow, and we're also gonna
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:15.320]  show you the children's faces, so in case they disappear, this is like a wanted poster
[2:18:15.320 --> 2:18:20.280]  or the back of a milk carton, and we're gonna show you the men in there, showing what women
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:23.160]  they were picking out, that they wanted to take somewhere with them, we're gonna show
[2:18:23.160 --> 2:18:27.320]  you all of this, because they didn't even hide it, because they know how to hide it in plain
[2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:45.280]  view, here's the report, and she says it's her baby, and she's told me that she's not
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:19:05.000]  really fake, she's got angel of death stuff on every arm and leg, that's an MS-13 tag,
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:13.440]  that's the particular ones, these are exact, so everybody of her name is Santa Muerte,
[2:19:13.440 --> 2:19:18.760]  she's the patron saint to drug cartels and human smugglers, investigators say the smugglers
[2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:23.680]  are praying for forgiveness, praying to a saint, who they believe makes no distinction
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:33.640]  between the devout and the sinful, so as you can see this is our same van driver from a
[2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:41.280]  few days ago, and she is the one who transports the illegals from the catholic charity in
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:48.960]  downtown McAllen, and brings them to the airport, and she then facilitates them getting on
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:20:13.800]  the plane, so if you look right here, I want you to know this, look at her leg, and she
[2:20:13.800 --> 2:20:21.520]  brings van load after van load of illegal aliens to the McAllen airport to sit there
[2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:29.440]  and be processed and assisted in getting on flights to the interior of the United States,
[2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:35.680]  now none of these people have a driver's license or a United States passport or passport of
[2:20:35.680 --> 2:20:41.560]  any kind, they have just shown up on the border, and border patrol is releasing them for one
[2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:46.200]  reason and one reason only, because they are traveling with kids, that's what's going on
[2:20:46.200 --> 2:20:52.280]  right now, this is van load after van load after van load, several thousand a day coming
[2:20:52.280 --> 2:20:57.560]  through the McAllen international airport here in Texas, we've also been told that
[2:20:57.560 --> 2:21:02.640]  a number of these illegal immigrants do not have a hearing date, that they're literally
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:06.400]  being allowed to go into the interior of the United States without a hearing date, but
[2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:10.440]  we're getting to the bottom of it, and our favorite van driver right here, the one who
[2:21:10.440 --> 2:21:15.720]  was upset the other day that we were filming her, she's on the phone right now, I know,
[2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:24.720]  I know, well because your assistance is smuggling illegal aliens, that's why, okay, that's why.
[2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:30.960]  Alright, tomorrow we're going to show you footage of a man from the east coast on video
[2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:36.920]  saying I want that woman, I want that woman, I want that woman, and they're giving to him,
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:41.440]  he does this on camera proudly in front of us, so if you want to go down to the border
[2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:46.520]  right now, you can literally just pick out women you want.
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:52.200]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[2:21:52.200 --> 2:21:57.520]  full verses that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together, but I'll tell
[2:21:57.520 --> 2:22:04.280]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game, and they are trying to destroy
[2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:09.600]  all independent forms of media, they're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance,
[2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:15.360]  so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate,
[2:22:15.360 --> 2:22:19.160]  everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true, so it's now that
[2:22:19.160 --> 2:22:24.800]  your credibility is way up, the power structures are to silence those of us that they can't,
[2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:32.280]  but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us, we have the power, but the sun
[2:22:32.280 --> 2:22:37.600]  is setting on humanity and setting on free speech, we have to make sure that we find
[2:22:37.600 --> 2:22:42.320]  hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come, so be the polar bearer
[2:22:42.320 --> 2:22:43.320]  as you are.
[2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:50.320]  Gerald and South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:51.320]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[2:22:51.320 --> 2:22:55.640]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all
[2:22:55.640 --> 2:22:56.640]  this stupidity.
[2:22:56.640 --> 2:23:00.080]  I wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:06.840]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:08.320]  Living defense saved my life.
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:12.640]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:14.080]  Living defense brought me back.
[2:23:14.080 --> 2:23:19.840]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now, this
[2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:27.280]  is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you
[2:23:27.280 --> 2:23:33.560]  and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended
[2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:36.800]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:38.680]  That's right where we're at brother.
[2:23:38.680 --> 2:23:43.080]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[2:23:43.080 --> 2:23:47.480]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:52.280]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world, they are creating insecurity, crime,
[2:23:52.280 --> 2:23:53.760]  war and famine.
[2:23:53.760 --> 2:23:58.400]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our
[2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:00.920]  family's sakes, but also our community.
[2:24:00.920 --> 2:24:06.080]  And citizensstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:07.640]  lowest price you're going to find.

[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:54.760]  Big Tech is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom
[2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:55.960]  of association.
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:25:00.440]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:03.880]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:06.840]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[2:25:06.840 --> 2:25:10.640]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:15.360]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:21.160]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the

[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:28.360]  the info war.
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:32.840]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[2:25:32.840 --> 2:25:33.840]  from them.
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:37.840]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:40.280]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:45.160]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:50.440]  Go to infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:26:02.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:08.440]  Live, raw and uncensored.
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:13.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:15.240]  Alex Jones.
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:22.080]  Well, last hour we had Brad, he's a very successful track star in his own right, a successful
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:27.320]  software developer and also helped coach his local public high school that his daughters,
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:28.820]  $4 went to.
[2:26:28.820 --> 2:26:32.520]  He got fired because he said we're not going to wear masks when we run the marathons basically
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:37.320]  when we run the long distance races, the short distance races, it can cause a long to collapse.
[2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:41.000]  Medical science says don't do it, it doesn't protect you, we're not doing it until they
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  fired him.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:46.440]  Well, he stood up to the right thing and now he's standing up and he's done well in software
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:50.120]  engineering so he's going to try to launch a private track operation that I think is
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:51.620]  going to be very popular.
[2:26:51.620 --> 2:26:58.640]  But Teresa Mullins is another great person standing up against evil and she settled North
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:02.280]  Carolina as a U.S. Army veteran of eight and a half years, armed with discharge, she worked
[2:27:02.280 --> 2:27:07.080]  13 years of personal management, music business for rock and metal bands and after owning a
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:09.680]  bed and breakfast couple of years she became a flight attendant.
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:14.480]  She has worked with various airlines 13 years as a crew member, five and a half, she lost
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:16.080]  her last company.
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:21.720]  She resigned from the airline January 31, 2021 a few months ago and now flies private
[2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:23.160]  if she can.
[2:27:23.160 --> 2:27:31.200]  You can find her conservative clothing boutique thing roaring 20s at GeneralLadyBeautique.com.
[2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:35.600]  GeneralLadyBeautique.com and she's here, she quit over this, she witnessed what's happening,
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:39.720]  they're trying to make newborn babies now wear a mask because there's nothing the cult won't
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:40.720]  do.
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:44.280]  They're bullying people, they're going completely insane but John Kerry doesn't have to wear
[2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:45.520]  his mask.
[2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:49.600]  So Teresa, thank you so much for joining us here and thank you for standing up and speaking
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:50.600]  out.
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:51.600]  We need more people to do it.
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:52.600]  Hi, Alex.
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:55.320]  Thank you for having me on your show.
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:28:00.480]  My family and I have been great supporters of InfoWars for a long time.
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:01.480]  Really appreciate it.
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:02.480]  Thank you.
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:06.640]  I'm just proud of our audience because the last guest we had on was a listener too.
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:08.280]  We like call these people that are standing up.
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:09.280]  It's always our listeners.
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:13.200]  It's not that we've got you to do what you're doing, we're all just in the same family here
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:14.800]  of awake folks.
[2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:19.240]  So tell us about you, tell us about what you witnessed in the last year and what made
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:22.800]  you a resign?
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:24.720]  Well I'm a mom of three.
[2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:32.160]  My company offered a leave with a paid deduction.
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:39.560]  They wanted volunteers so I volunteered but come July they implemented the mask mandates
[2:28:39.560 --> 2:28:43.360]  on the passengers and I was very disturbed by this.
[2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:48.040]  But throughout the summer and fall of 2020 I had much hope that this mandate would go
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:49.040]  away.
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:54.240]  I hoped that it would be temporary as they kept telling us on the news.
[2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:59.600]  So I kind of just kept bidding for time off.
[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:01.960]  I was due back in January.
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:04.200]  So on January 31st they called me back.
[2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:08.120]  I paced the floor for hours and hours trying to decide what I should do.
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:14.160]  So I was reasoning with myself, you know, reasoning with myself that I should go back
[2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:18.640]  and I should just deal with it, that everything's going to be okay, it's going to be temporary.
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:20.400]  But I could not do it.
[2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:25.520]  I could not participate in this oppressive compliance ritual.
[2:29:25.520 --> 2:29:28.520]  So I called the company, I quit.
[2:29:28.520 --> 2:29:30.320]  I told them why.
[2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:35.520]  Afterwards I called my supervisor and told her that I quit and I'd be willing to come
[2:29:35.520 --> 2:29:40.280]  back as soon as those mask mandates were removed from the passengers.
[2:29:40.280 --> 2:29:42.960]  She didn't have a whole lot to say.
[2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:49.280]  So I decided I might as well tell the union what just took place and I was very surprised
[2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:56.280]  when they wrote back saying that I should or could file a grievance and I needed to
[2:29:56.280 --> 2:30:00.360]  cite a breach in the collective bargaining agreement.
[2:30:00.360 --> 2:30:05.960]  So I went to the discrimination paragraph and I cited CREED, that it was against my
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:10.160]  moral CREED to force people to put masks on their face.
[2:30:10.160 --> 2:30:14.200]  Yeah, last time we checked you're not living in Sudan as some sex slave, I mean this is
[2:30:14.200 --> 2:30:16.200]  literally a burqa.
[2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:18.400]  Yes, it is.
[2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:19.400]  It is like a burqa.
[2:30:19.400 --> 2:30:23.240]  It's an oppressive compliance ritual, that's exactly what it is.
[2:30:23.240 --> 2:30:24.920]  Please continue.
[2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:25.920]  I love your term.
[2:30:25.920 --> 2:30:26.920]  Did you invent that?
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:27.920]  I've never heard it before.
[2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:31.920]  Well, I don't know, it just kind of, maybe I did.
[2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:36.200]  Oppressive compliance ritual, no that's what it is, you coined that, that's a genius term.
[2:30:36.200 --> 2:30:38.800]  This is an oppressive compliance cult ritual.
[2:30:38.800 --> 2:30:43.880]  Yes, well I have a sign on the front of my house because we get deliveries with, you
[2:30:43.880 --> 2:30:47.000]  know, masks, delivery drivers and the post offices.
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:50.600]  We don't talk to masked men.
[2:30:50.600 --> 2:30:54.560]  And I say, you know, I have a sign on the front of my house that your oppressive mask
[2:30:54.560 --> 2:30:55.720]  is optional.
[2:30:55.720 --> 2:31:00.560]  So I just feel like people should have the choice as they did before.
[2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:05.680]  As a flight attendant, I saw many passengers wearing masks for this COVID nonsense took
[2:31:05.680 --> 2:31:11.520]  place and we didn't care, it was okay, it was their choice, that's how it should be.
[2:31:11.520 --> 2:31:16.080]  Well, it shows us exactly, if you want to be neurotic, you can exactly, if a woman wants
[2:31:16.080 --> 2:31:18.840]  to wear a burqa, a beekeeper, so she should be allowed to.
[2:31:18.840 --> 2:31:23.840]  If someone wants to have a circumcision done, they should, when they're 18, they can do
[2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:24.840]  it.
[2:31:24.840 --> 2:31:28.320]  It shouldn't be done to people that are not agreeing to it.
[2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:30.840]  We should not be forced to do this, is what you're saying.
[2:31:30.840 --> 2:31:37.640]  Yes, and I tried to seek out some help and remedies over the summer and fall, but it was
[2:31:37.640 --> 2:31:38.640]  very difficult.
[2:31:38.640 --> 2:31:45.600]  I couldn't find any real organization until I came across FAFTA out of United Kingdom.
[2:31:45.600 --> 2:31:52.600]  And I've just learned about another organization called Healthy American, another one COVID
[2:31:52.600 --> 2:31:54.920]  Legal USA.
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:32:03.720]  I've been getting many emails, a lot of correspondence from the general public, so many, it's overwhelming.
[2:32:03.720 --> 2:32:10.440]  I've also had a handful of emails from captains, first officers, and flight attendants that
[2:32:10.440 --> 2:32:13.440]  have quit, so I am not the only one.
[2:32:13.440 --> 2:32:19.000]  Well, I've told this story and it's in, I guess, an Esquire profile of me because the
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:24.280]  guy was there in Arkansas, I was on a family trip, I wanted to go see, I was a child with
[2:32:24.280 --> 2:32:29.680]  my parents, we went to say at the old Arlington Hotel, and we went to this museum of the Ozarks,
[2:32:29.680 --> 2:32:31.680]  it's a big, huge complex.
[2:32:31.680 --> 2:32:37.200]  I'd been there when I was a child, and they had this, this big labyrinth thing that they
[2:32:37.200 --> 2:32:41.480]  call, like, inside the hills of the Ozarks, it was like little tubes.
[2:32:41.480 --> 2:32:44.720]  So I'm a big guy now, I thought, well, I'll go in this with my kids.
[2:32:44.720 --> 2:32:46.880]  Well, the thing went on for like 20 minutes.
[2:32:46.880 --> 2:32:50.760]  It was tiny holes, and I got claustrophobic, and I had to control myself to get out, I
[2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:52.080]  almost went crazy.
[2:32:52.080 --> 2:32:55.520]  But after I did that, I've been much more claustrophobic, it's like you get a bee sting,
[2:32:55.520 --> 2:32:58.920]  you get allergic, once you've been in a confined space, it was really stressful.
[2:32:58.920 --> 2:33:03.320]  I was an idiot to go in there, I've been more claustrophobic since then.
[2:33:03.320 --> 2:33:07.360]  And when I try to put a mask on, I can control myself, like I don't have fear of, like, all
[2:33:07.360 --> 2:33:12.280]  sorts of stuff, but when I start wearing a mask and I smell my breath and it's all hot
[2:33:12.280 --> 2:33:16.760]  and it's oppressive, and it's like, this is a muzzle that's been put on me, and I'm
[2:33:16.760 --> 2:33:17.880]  not being dramatic.
[2:33:17.880 --> 2:33:22.160]  I couldn't imagine being on transatlantic flights, or God forbid, a flight 16 hours
[2:33:22.160 --> 2:33:23.160]  to Australia.
[2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:26.760]  What was it like for you wearing this filthy face type?
[2:33:26.760 --> 2:33:29.800]  We're supposed to be breathing in air, exchanging it.
[2:33:29.800 --> 2:33:33.720]  We know all the studies show that we boost people's immune systems by sharing all our
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:35.400]  germs, we're communal creatures.
[2:33:35.400 --> 2:33:39.240]  I mean, how did you deal with that, and what are the other flight attendants saying?
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:46.600]  Well, Alex, when my company implemented the mask mandates on the passengers, I was already
[2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:48.160]  on leave.
[2:33:48.160 --> 2:33:51.760]  I haven't worked a flight since the end of May.
[2:33:51.760 --> 2:33:55.280]  At that time, my company required that the crew wear a mask.
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:34:01.160]  I didn't like it, but I was, you know, I felt like it was part of the company's request.
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:03.280]  So what was it like for you to wear it, though?
[2:34:03.280 --> 2:34:05.120]  Did you find it to be oppressive?
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:11.920]  Oh, absolutely, and especially for me, I was much more offended probably from my co-worker
[2:34:11.920 --> 2:34:15.920]  standing next to me because I've had a lot of dental work done in the past year, so I
[2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:22.240]  was looking forward to smiling and showing off, and it just felt like they were shutting
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:29.120]  me down, but they started this mandate in July.
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:34.240]  I was already on leave, so I continued to bid for it throughout the year.
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:42.000]  I never went back and wore the mask when the passengers were mandated.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:48.840]  Prior to July, my company was handing out safety kits, giving passengers the option.
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:50.840]  I felt like that's the right thing to do.
[2:34:50.840 --> 2:34:52.240]  That's what they should have done.
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:53.880]  That's all the airline should have done.
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:34:55.160]  It's not just my airline.
[2:34:55.160 --> 2:34:57.320]  This is a nationwide problem.
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:00.000]  All the airlines should just make it.
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:06.360]  And from what I understand, too, these masks are actually considered medical devices.
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:12.520]  So I don't see how the FAA can approve all of our passengers wearing medical devices.
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:13.520]  That's right.
[2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:14.520]  Well, that's what it is.
[2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:15.520]  It's corporations engaging in medical controls.
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:20.880]  It's like these new QR codes and these new vaccine passports are literally your own personal
[2:35:20.880 --> 2:35:22.800]  thing now being with the corporation.
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:26.080]  They're raping us, and with the vaccine, they really rape our DNA.
[2:35:26.080 --> 2:35:29.960]  They engage in genetic colonization.
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:33.560]  That's this is literally a genetic invasion.
[2:35:33.560 --> 2:35:38.520]  I want to ask Teresa Mullins, when we come back, talking to current flight attendants,
[2:35:38.520 --> 2:35:41.080]  she knows how are they responding to this ongoing nightmare.
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:42.080]  We'll be right back.
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:46.080]  Stay with us.
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:51.200]  When I tell you to supplement your natural diet, so you'll be healthier and funnily and
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:54.240]  forth at the same time, I'm not lecturing you.
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:55.400]  I eat too much red meat.
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:56.400]  I drink too much.
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:35:57.400]  I work too much.
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:02.600]  I have my own issues with stress, but I can tell you without winter sun, without
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:06.960]  vitamin mineral fusion, without one cleanse, all three of which I take every day, I would
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:09.520]  not be able to continue on what I do.
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:11.000]  These are amazing products.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:15.400]  And if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals, you're not going to be able
[2:36:15.400 --> 2:36:16.400]  to function.
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:17.400]  In fact, you're going to die.
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:20.400]  That's what we will starve for like a food.
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:25.400]  These products have it all concentrated in one place for you to make sure that every
[2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:31.240]  essential vitamin mineral you need, you get the D3, the K, in winter sun, and all of them
[2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:36.360]  together with amino acids in vitamin and refusion, and then a lot of cleanse research
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:37.360]  of yourself.
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:38.360]  It's amazing.

[2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:01.400]  system.

[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:52.560]  Randy Dewright.
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:53.560]  Randy Dewright.
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:54.560]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:55.560]  Go ahead.
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:37:56.560]  Thanks, Paul.
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:37:57.560]  Let me say I love your products.
[2:37:57.560 --> 2:38:03.440]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:08.920]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:14.200]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:15.200]  actually.
[2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:18.240]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:38:18.240 --> 2:38:22.280]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[2:38:22.280 --> 2:38:25.840]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:29.880]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:34.560]  period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:35.560]  This is working.
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:36.560]  This is wonderful.
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:37.560]  You know?
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:40.960]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know?
[2:38:40.960 --> 2:38:47.280]  So, anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:49.600]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:51.600]  It's very bittersweet.
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:38:54.720]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have
[2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:55.720]  a lot of credibility.
[2:38:55.720 --> 2:38:56.720]  But I don't care about that.
[2:38:56.720 --> 2:38:58.040]  I care about beating the new world order.
[2:38:58.040 --> 2:39:03.280]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:05.960]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:08.200]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:09.400]  But let's just say this.
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:13.760]  We're going to see this through to the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:17.400]  So please pray for us, and please buy the products, and then forwardstore.com.
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:19.960]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:22.800]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:23.800]  Do they fund freedom?
[2:39:23.800 --> 2:39:25.120]  No, a lot of them don't.
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:29.800]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:31.640]  up and looking for truth.
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:33.240]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:36.680]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:40.160]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:43.600]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're
[2:39:43.600 --> 2:39:49.880]  going to be on the air, and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:40:13.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:19.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide is Alex Jones.
[2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:20.840]  All right.
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:36.520]  Coming up in the fourth hour, he's a great talk show host, Stu Peters, has that amazing
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:40.720]  pastor from Calgary, that Polish immigrant, saying, get out of here, you Nazis, get out
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:41.720]  of my church.
[2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:44.600]  They shut down all those churches, build fences around them.
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:46.480]  It's just over the top.
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:50.960]  And human smuggler, it's illegal, Biden didn't sign the executive order, he didn't pass
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:53.160]  the law, even if he did, it'd be illegal.
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:58.480]  But human smuggler with baby and cartel tats confronted the airport by Info Wars that
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:02.520]  just went live 10 minutes ago or so at Bandai Video.
[2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:07.560]  And it's just as dramatic as important as us jumping in front of that car.
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:09.760]  But I've got to review these hours of footage.
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:14.720]  The stuff I've already seen is even crazier, tomorrow, 4 p.m., they will put the report
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:15.720]  out.
[2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:19.640]  They'll come and take delay it so that we, you know, in studio can add a lot of things.
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:24.600]  I'll be up here at noon tomorrow with my crew going over all the footage and playing it
[2:41:24.600 --> 2:41:29.880]  in a commercial-free transmission that is even more insane, basically, auctions of people
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:33.240]  where it's like a slave block, and they're like, I want that woman, I want that woman.
[2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:38.400]  You're going to see this tomorrow, people are like, aren't you scared of the cartels,
[2:41:38.400 --> 2:41:40.200]  aren't you scared they'll sue you?
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:41.840]  Line up here.
[2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:44.480]  It's not about me.
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:47.640]  It's about fighting these people, and the attitude of being scared of all these people
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.360]  has gotten us where we are.
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:51.160]  It's unbelievable.
[2:41:51.160 --> 2:41:53.160]  All right.
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:57.720]  Theresa Mullins is a flight attendant that resigned in January because they were trying
[2:41:57.720 --> 2:41:59.440]  to make the crew wear masks.
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:02.680]  He already submitted herself to wearing one.
[2:42:02.680 --> 2:42:06.320]  And other points you'd like to make about where you see the world going.
[2:42:06.320 --> 2:42:09.640]  I mean, there's so many crazy things happening.
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:14.200]  We've got the Pfizer-Former Q-Sign that's coming out saying the vaccine's a depopulation
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:15.200]  weapon.
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:19.880]  How does it feel to have Bill Gates say he wants to block the sun out and that you're
[2:42:19.880 --> 2:42:20.880]  obsolete and non-essential?
[2:42:20.880 --> 2:42:24.400]  I mean, it's like a bad James Bond blood.
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:36.160]  Well, it's a canceled culture digital thunderdome, and we have state legislatures to make laws,
[2:42:36.160 --> 2:42:37.160]  not Bill Gates.
[2:42:37.160 --> 2:42:43.480]  That's what I think about Bill Gates and his ideas.
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:44.480]  I agree with you.
[2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:48.000]  Well, listen, I always ask the questions, but I'd like to tell Cass, what's on your mind?
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:50.920]  What do you want to impart to folks while you're probably talking to conservatively
[2:42:50.920 --> 2:42:52.560]  two million people right now?
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:43:00.600]  Well, Alex, like I said, I've been getting a handful of emails from captains, first officers
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:05.560]  and flight attendants, and they aren't happy with this mask mandate, but they have fear
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:07.160]  of losing their job.
[2:43:07.160 --> 2:43:10.240]  Now, there's other fears, too.
[2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:13.640]  What about the evacuation of the aircraft?
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:20.520]  For instance, there is a video online, a public video called Airbus 380 Emergency Evacuation
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:21.520]  Test.
[2:43:21.520 --> 2:43:23.000]  It's in English and in French.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:24.520]  There's several versions.
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:31.080]  It shows approximately 16 flight attendants evacuating 800 people approximately.
[2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:36.520]  It's a very intriguing video because cabin crews are required to prove to the FAA that
[2:43:36.520 --> 2:43:43.400]  they can evacuate an aircraft within 90 seconds, but where is the proving run for the mask,
[2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:49.480]  for the cabin-filled, masked humans?
[2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:55.720]  How would that intrude with the duration of the 90-second evacuation?
[2:43:55.720 --> 2:44:02.720]  What about at 38,000 feet when you only have three seconds to don your oxygen mask?
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:06.640]  What happens to the woman that has three children?
[2:44:06.640 --> 2:44:12.240]  She needs to remove their face mask first, and then place oxygen mask over her kids.
[2:44:12.240 --> 2:44:13.240]  Exactly.
[2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:17.280]  That's how you skin the bureaucrats is pointing out their own bureaucracy is a fraud.
[2:44:17.280 --> 2:44:22.040]  If masks are causing runners to have collapsed lungs, well, now they're going to be liable
[2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:23.360]  for the collapsed lung.
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:26.520]  You hit the lawyers back with their own medicine.
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:33.280]  I want to see the FAA make a proving run with a full cabin filled with masked humans, and
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:36.840]  I want to see them accomplish it under 90 seconds.
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:43.160]  Let's see a scenario at 38,000 feet, too, when you only have seconds to grab that oxygen
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:44.440]  mask.
[2:44:44.440 --> 2:44:45.440]  What about that?
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:46.440]  Incredible.
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:50.040]  I hope you'll be a consultant on the show with us as a former flight attendant that stood
[2:44:50.040 --> 2:44:53.400]  up for what's right, but sorry, you were going to say something else.
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:54.400]  Yes.
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:59.600]  I'm going to say to our president, Donald Trump, bring back Trump Shuttle now.
[2:44:59.600 --> 2:45:03.920]  I have enough emails from crew members that will help you set up in flight.
[2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:07.480]  Oh, yeah, Trump launched an airline for a while.
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:09.560]  Let's bring back a mask-free Trump airline.
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:11.040]  Gosh, people love that.
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:13.080]  I'd buy tickets on that.
[2:45:13.080 --> 2:45:17.360]  Bring back Trump Shuttle now, and this time, he shouldn't target business travelers with
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:18.360]  gold-plated seatbelts.
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:21.760]  This time, he should just target Patriot vacationers.
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:24.640]  Yeah, Trump learned that people love casinos.
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:26.920]  Well, I don't love all that glitz and crap.
[2:45:26.920 --> 2:45:29.840]  I won't just plain Jane Plains and good service.
[2:45:29.840 --> 2:45:30.840]  I agree.
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:32.560]  Trump should do that, shouldn't he?
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:37.200]  I feel like the FAA is the issue here.
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:39.160]  You know, I'm just a little person.
[2:45:39.160 --> 2:45:42.400]  I don't even have that much seniority.
[2:45:42.400 --> 2:45:49.480]  There are flight attendants with 20, 30, 40 years at their company, so I don't know.
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:53.600]  The unions seem like they're pro-mask, and I'm not sure what to do, Alex, but I feel
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:54.600]  like it's the FAA.
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:45:55.800]  Well, it's all virtue signaling.
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:46:00.800]  You point out Fauci's study he put out in 2008 that the main cause of death, the Spanish
[2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:02.320]  flu, was mask.
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:03.720]  They caused bacterial pneumonia.
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:07.480]  That's why the mask areas had higher death rates, three times higher on average.
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:12.320]  Well, of course, you're not supposed to be breathing this stuff back in.
[2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:13.320]  It's ridiculous.
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:22.480]  Yes, and Alex, I'm heartbroken to see these videos of passengers being removed from airlines
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:24.320]  and being bullied at the gate.
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:25.800]  Now, I was a victim.
[2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:34.080]  I did some bullying of my own in grade school, and Karma, I was bullied as a victimized as
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:41.080]  a bully in high school, and it affected my life tremendously, which is why I named my
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:46.000]  boutique, Gentle Lady Boutique, because I'd really like to have a personal lobby to bring
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:49.360]  back gentle behavior in the United States.
[2:46:49.360 --> 2:46:50.760]  We've really lost our manners.
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:51.760]  No, no, I agree.
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:53.160]  We need to be more gentle people.
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:54.160]  That's absolutely...
[2:46:54.160 --> 2:46:59.600]  I feel like it would prevent many situations that have just gotten out of control.
[2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:05.720]  We should be gentle to gentle people and very mean to people that aren't gentle.
[2:47:05.720 --> 2:47:10.200]  People can be very mean, and there's a lot of bullies out there right now.
[2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:11.560]  That's everywhere.
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:13.000]  Almost everyone's the enemy.
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:15.880]  Well, they've divided us to conquer us.
[2:47:15.880 --> 2:47:19.520]  Thank you so much, amazing Teresa Mullins.
[2:47:19.520 --> 2:47:22.000]  GentleLadyBoutique.com.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:27.640]  I know that all that kind of fashion is all the rage right now, so I'll have my wife check
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:28.640]  it out.
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:29.640]  Thank you so much.
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:30.640]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:47:30.640 --> 2:47:31.640]  Okay.
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:38.280]  Listen, I didn't get up here at the start of the show in second, barely do the show with
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:42.760]  what I know and what I'm seeing just to say that like we're being dramatic.
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:44.120]  I don't feel guilty.
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:50.240]  I just feel really bad because I've got like an eight-page report from Life Science or
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:59.800]  Life News, and it's all there with the Chief Science Officer from Pfizer saying there's
[2:47:59.800 --> 2:48:00.800]  a plan to kill everybody.
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:05.000]  I mean, I could have spent the whole show on that, and it's so insane.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:09.800]  And then I've got all these great guests they set up, and then I've got the governor saying
[2:48:09.800 --> 2:48:12.280]  they're running giant sex operations with kidnapped kids.
[2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:20.000]  My God, I've got video of it, and then I've got other footage that is so insane.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:25.640]  Like I said, one of these clips I have would take regular media like a week to look at
[2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:28.840]  even figure out what to do, and then they decide this is too damaging, this is too deadly,
[2:48:28.840 --> 2:48:30.960]  we can't put this out.
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:38.000]  Video of the drug cartels, all God's children that Pelosi talked about will come after us.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:42.440]  Well, this isn't an exercise of having courage.
[2:48:42.440 --> 2:48:44.800]  This is an exercise of I will complete this mission.
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:49.260]  I don't even think about that, but then I have to talk about that because I realize
[2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:53.360]  listeners and people are hardcore, but the general public literally lives in a state
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:54.360]  of fear.
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:55.360]  I am so free.
[2:48:55.360 --> 2:48:56.360]  I don't live in a state of fear.
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:48:59.240]  I just do what I'm supposed to do, and I don't worry about it.
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:01.800]  I have free will, but I am like a robot.
[2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:02.800]  It's really true.
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:03.800]  I'm like a robot.
[2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:07.520]  I just do this, and I keep doing it, and I keep doing it because I know we're going
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:08.520]  to win.
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:10.520]  And when we stand up, we have nothing but victory.
[2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:11.520]  That's what's funny.
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:14.640]  You know, 99% of the time when I do something, it's successful.
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:18.240]  When I see other people like Project Veritas, they're incredibly successful.
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:25.960]  Other people think it's like going to the Mars or something to stand up and take action.
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:28.720]  Inaction is destruction.
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:33.480]  Inaction is political death, human death, and we have to say no to it.
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:38.560]  Stu Peters has that pastor on from Calgary coming up that was so powerful that we should
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:41.920]  just start the next segment with that, or maybe segment two, six after, come in with
[2:49:41.920 --> 2:49:42.920]  that.
[2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:45.520]  I'm not programing the next hour for Stu Peters, but we should come in with, get out
[2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:47.760]  of here, come back with a warrant.
[2:49:47.760 --> 2:49:52.840]  I mean, it's, you are Gestapo, and they are, and they're putting up fences around huge
[2:49:52.840 --> 2:49:58.560]  churches and saying, you're never reopening, but Walmart and Target and the Stripper Club
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:00.960]  is open, and they should all be able to be open.
[2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:04.800]  The point is, is this is tyranny, and why are they targeting Christians?
[2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:09.960]  Stu Peters takes over from RedVoiceMedia.com, and then, as I told you, the War Room, 3 p.m.
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:12.080]  has got a lot of breaking news today.
[2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:13.600]  Maybe some exclusive clips if we can get them ready.
[2:50:13.600 --> 2:50:14.600]  I got to review these clips.
[2:50:14.600 --> 2:50:15.600]  This is out of control.
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:18.360]  This is like, who's going, I want that woman, I want that one.
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:20.800]  Yes, sir, they will load them in the vehicle for you.
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:21.800]  Come women with me.
[2:50:21.800 --> 2:50:26.560]  I mean, I never, I was like, I mean, Jabba the Hutt, Alice or something with this.
[2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:33.640]  So tomorrow, 4 p.m., a big special report with exclusive footage at infowars.com.

[2:50:48.760 --> 2:50:50.880]  cases, are toxic.

[2:51:35.720 --> 2:51:41.120]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:45.920]  and their attack on humanity, I've been forced to last 27 years to be a public figure, and
[2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:49.840]  we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:53.320]  I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:54.320]  a break.
[2:51:54.320 --> 2:51:55.320]  The statinism's out in the open.
[2:51:55.320 --> 2:51:59.120]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil
[2:51:59.120 --> 2:52:00.120]  is so clear.
[2:52:00.120 --> 2:52:01.120]  And I get it.
[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:03.840]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches, a lot of you have been turned off
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:08.960]  by the corrupt priest class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them.
[2:52:08.960 --> 2:52:15.240]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so
[2:52:15.240 --> 2:52:16.240]  essential.
[2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:20.960]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:22.800]  And so that's what info wars is really all about.
[2:52:22.800 --> 2:52:24.320]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:28.040]  Thank you for spreading the word about info wars and thank you for supporting us to keep
[2:52:28.040 --> 2:52:32.480]  us on air by visiting infowars.com because without your daily and weekly and monthly
[2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:59.320]  purchases will be taken off the air, so thank you for the support infowars.com.
[2:52:59.320 --> 2:53:05.600]  He's got the Polish immigrant who lives in Calgary and has a church, small church that
[2:53:05.600 --> 2:53:06.600]  got raided.
[2:53:06.600 --> 2:53:07.600]  He stood up to him.
[2:53:07.600 --> 2:53:12.400]  He's got that pastor on, Stu Peters, is about to take over right now, but he's a former
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:17.840]  bounty hunter, one of the most important jobs really in enforcing law and order in this
[2:53:17.840 --> 2:53:18.840]  country.
[2:53:18.840 --> 2:53:21.880]  He goes back to British common law, but I wanted to ask him, because I was thinking we
[2:53:21.880 --> 2:53:26.160]  ought to get Stu Peters to come to Texas and go with us to the border because I was
[2:53:26.160 --> 2:53:30.080]  only there two days, oh, it was there three days, and people were like, how are you getting
[2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:31.080]  this footage?
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:35.680]  Well, why is this camera rolling because we're a camera crew, literally I have hours of
[2:53:35.680 --> 2:53:40.440]  footage we haven't even put out yet of like the most insane stuff that I know is incredibly
[2:53:40.440 --> 2:53:41.440]  dangerous.
[2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:48.120]  So I want to make sure we put it out accurately of men going, I want her and her and her.
[2:53:48.120 --> 2:53:50.760]  And like our crew is like, what are you doing?
[2:53:50.760 --> 2:53:51.760]  Right?
[2:53:51.760 --> 2:53:52.760]  Well, they're here.
[2:53:52.760 --> 2:53:55.960]  I mean, I'm here to get women.
[2:53:55.960 --> 2:53:56.960]  It's like this.
[2:53:56.960 --> 2:53:57.960]  I don't know how to explain it.
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:54:04.240]  The arrogance of how they're all acting like it's totally normal and it's all illegal.
[2:54:04.240 --> 2:54:05.560]  It's all violence, federal law.
[2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:06.560]  There's no executive order.
[2:54:06.560 --> 2:54:08.200]  That would be overturned by the courts.
[2:54:08.200 --> 2:54:12.200]  And I'm just watching human smuggling and kids I haven't checked, no court hearings,
[2:54:12.200 --> 2:54:13.200]  no nothing.
[2:54:13.200 --> 2:54:14.200]  The governor says it's sex traffic.
[2:54:14.200 --> 2:54:18.720]  I'm interviewing eyewitnesses and saw kids being raped by these NGOs that are brought
[2:54:18.720 --> 2:54:22.160]  in, the border patrol, the FBI wave background checks on them.
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:26.200]  This woman has MS-13 tats, we check with the tech, you know, with the state police.
[2:54:26.200 --> 2:54:30.600]  They go, yeah, that's a particular MS-13 tat with a baby handing it off into a freaking
[2:54:30.600 --> 2:54:31.600]  airplane.
[2:54:31.600 --> 2:54:33.600]  I'm living in the goddamn twilight zone.
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:34.600]  Excuse my French.
[2:54:34.600 --> 2:54:36.280]  Excuse me, Lord.
[2:54:36.280 --> 2:54:38.840]  So just briefly, Stu, what do you make of this?
[2:54:38.840 --> 2:54:42.160]  I mean, this is the most lawless collapse I've ever seen.
[2:54:42.160 --> 2:54:48.040]  100% intentional, absolutely 100% intentional as part of, it's part of the big distraction
[2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:53.040]  away from the talks that are happening behind our backs, but yet somewhat seemingly right
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:56.840]  in the wide open about the gun grab and the silencing, you know, you look at these people
[2:54:56.840 --> 2:55:02.720]  from big tech people, these Twitter people and Zuckerberg, you know, up here testifying.
[2:55:02.720 --> 2:55:05.640]  It's no secret that this is a distraction away from that.
[2:55:05.640 --> 2:55:08.880]  This is a part of making Trump supporters still continue to look bad.
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:09.880]  We're all racist.
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:15.000]  If we have anything to say about illegal immigration, they're hiding the gun grab, they're intentionally
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:19.640]  inserting these people and I'm going to talk about some of this upcoming before the pastor
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:20.640]  is on.
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:24.080]  And then again, maybe with the pastor, because this guy actually left communism.
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:26.200]  This guy has witnessed this firsthand.
[2:55:26.200 --> 2:55:30.320]  You know, you and I are, we have the luxury of being American born United States.
[2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:34.080]  I was saying that before you came on three minutes ago, we have no idea how good we've
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:35.080]  got it.
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:36.080]  Absolutely.
[2:55:36.080 --> 2:55:41.720]  And so even the illusion of freedom for these people that are coming from all over the world,
[2:55:41.720 --> 2:55:44.880]  just because they're entering from the porous border on the south, the wide open green
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:49.240]  lighted Biden border down there, you know, that doesn't mean that they're from South
[2:55:49.240 --> 2:55:51.560]  America, from Latin America, from Central America.
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:55.000]  These people are Yemenis terrorists, they're Syrian nationals.
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:56.160]  They're not idiots.
[2:55:56.160 --> 2:56:00.360]  You know, look at the Japanese military command staff before Pearl Harbor.
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  What did they say?
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:02.360]  We can't take them by land.
[2:56:02.360 --> 2:56:03.760]  They have too many guns there.
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:04.880]  We can't take them by sea.
[2:56:04.880 --> 2:56:09.440]  We can't jump off of boats and go take these people because there's 300 million guns here.
[2:56:09.440 --> 2:56:12.440]  We have to take them by air and then boom, Pearl Harbor.
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:17.200]  Well, so when Biden and these progressive radicals, these cabalists, these round table
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:22.680]  globalists are looking to topple an entire political system, they know that just straight
[2:56:22.680 --> 2:56:24.400]  out coming for our guns is not going to work.
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:26.280]  They have to find other means.
[2:56:26.280 --> 2:56:30.560]  So this is like the systematic kidnapping is what I would kind of compare it to.
[2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:34.280]  And I had this epiphany last night, as I was thinking about what do you do with somebody
[2:56:34.280 --> 2:56:35.680]  when you're going to kidnap them?
[2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:37.400]  Well, you have to disorient them.
[2:56:37.400 --> 2:56:38.400]  You have to blindfold them.
[2:56:38.400 --> 2:56:39.400]  You have to gag them.
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:41.160]  You have to lead them away from what's culture.
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:44.920]  Everything is about the stabilizing us, putting us into a wonderland.
[2:56:44.920 --> 2:56:46.080]  Yeah.
[2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:47.800]  And so this is a part of it.
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:54.640]  And if you can introduce this immediate chaos onto the streets, these people are coming here
[2:56:54.640 --> 2:56:56.920]  with these Biden shirts, but they're gangbangers.
[2:56:56.920 --> 2:56:58.200]  They're drug dealers.
[2:56:58.200 --> 2:57:05.320]  They are human smuggling, child trafficking, pedophiles, rapists, murderers, killers.
[2:57:05.320 --> 2:57:10.680]  These people are sent to these cities on purpose to instigate more of this violence for part
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:11.920]  of this shock and awe factor.
[2:57:11.920 --> 2:57:15.200]  It's almost like a home invasion happening to us right through our back door.
[2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:16.200]  Wow.
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:18.680]  You said it's two Peters red voice media dot com.
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:24.200]  I'm Alex Jones and tomorrow, four p.m.
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:28.280]  We're going to air the special report of a shoot tomorrow than air it then on the latest
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:33.160]  on the spars report, huge Intel there and the unseen footage that we're going to air
[2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:38.600]  tomorrow of basically an auction of women taking place.
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:40.080]  This is this is incredible.
[2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:41.080]  You can magnify this info.
[2:57:41.080 --> 2:57:42.080]  I know you will.
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:45.080]  The right back stay with us.
[2:57:45.080 --> 2:57:48.720]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[2:57:48.720 --> 2:57:53.000]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, all the terrible things
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  are unfolding.
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:58.520]  I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[2:57:58.520 --> 2:57:59.520]  I'm a public figure.
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:02.000]  So I get to see things that are public doesn't get to see.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:07.720]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood
[2:58:07.720 --> 2:58:14.400]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:17.400]  They don't want to go on with the globalist, but they're scared.
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:18.560]  They're looking for leadership.
[2:58:18.560 --> 2:58:21.160]  Well, that's where info comes in.
[2:58:21.160 --> 2:58:22.160]  You fund us.
[2:58:22.160 --> 2:58:25.520]  You support info or short.com and you write policy at the same time.
[2:58:25.520 --> 2:58:30.480]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, but the globalist will target
[2:58:30.480 --> 2:58:35.320]  you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:36.320]  That's our job.
[2:58:36.320 --> 2:58:41.600]  So please keep us on the air so we can hit the bar wire so we can meet the shock groups
[2:58:41.600 --> 2:58:42.600]  for the information war.
[2:58:42.600 --> 2:58:43.600]  Fund us at info or short.com.
[2:58:43.600 --> 2:58:44.600]  Another time.
[2:58:44.600 --> 2:58:45.600]  In the age of wonder.
[2:58:45.600 --> 2:58:46.600]  Yeah, everything that we were talking about.
[2:58:46.600 --> 2:58:47.600]  The gun's brown.
[2:58:47.600 --> 2:58:48.600]  It's on.
[2:58:48.600 --> 2:59:07.800]  It's mandatory confiscation.
[2:59:07.800 --> 2:59:08.800]  It's coming.
[2:59:08.800 --> 2:59:10.240]  You'll be jailed if you don't give up your guns.
[2:59:10.240 --> 2:59:11.560]  There's just no two ways about it.
[2:59:11.560 --> 2:59:15.640]  I'm not going to sugarcoat this message because it's urgency.
[2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:20.840]  The second amendment is clearly under attack as the distractions continue like illegal
[2:59:20.840 --> 2:59:26.040]  immigration, like the smuggling in an attempt to divert your focus away from these seemingly
[2:59:26.040 --> 2:59:28.760]  secret hearings that are taking place if you haven't been paying attention.
[2:59:28.760 --> 2:59:29.760]  A lot of us are busy.
[2:59:29.760 --> 2:59:30.760]  It's hard.
[2:59:30.760 --> 2:59:36.840]  Folks, don't just look at Biden and the Democrats because the liberal agenda has now graduated
[2:59:36.840 --> 2:59:42.840]  into a full blown totalitarian takeover and the toppling of our entire political system.
[2:59:42.840 --> 2:59:45.360]  They've shut everyone up already.
[2:59:45.360 --> 2:59:47.360]  We don't have time to dissect it all because we've done that.
[2:59:47.360 --> 2:59:48.360]  We've been over it.
[2:59:48.360 --> 2:59:49.360]  You're not ignorant people.
[2:59:49.360 --> 2:59:50.360]  As Alex says, you're here.
[2:59:50.360 --> 2:59:51.360]  You're part of the resistance.
[2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:52.360]  You're part of the informed.
[2:59:52.360 --> 2:59:53.740]  You're the targets.
[2:59:53.740 --> 2:59:57.120]  We are the enemy because we embrace freedom.
[2:59:57.120 --> 3:00:01.320]  We are to be destroyed because of our love of country by any means necessary were to
[3:00:01.320 --> 3:00:05.360]  be silenced, divided, disarmed and crushed.
[3:00:05.360 --> 3:00:07.320]  This isn't a new plan.
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:11.240]  This has been in the works for decades as unsuspecting Americans went about their daily
[3:00:11.240 --> 3:00:12.240]  business.
[3:00:12.240 --> 3:00:16.000]  This is a torch carrier for every single thing Donald Trump.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:17.600]  He's not the answer to all of this.
[3:00:17.600 --> 3:00:23.360]  He's one man, but he's the main factor in the equation that got us here, which is what
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:24.360]  we can't forget.
[3:00:24.360 --> 3:00:28.800]  The light that has now been shined on these cockroaches that have been working in the
[3:00:28.800 --> 3:00:32.680]  dark for so long was illuminated by the Trump presidency.
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:35.080]  He carried that light.
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:41.120]  He flipped that switch and now we're all standing here in this room in this space looking at
[3:00:41.120 --> 3:00:43.360]  what most of us have never even seen before.
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:47.440]  Imagine like I alluded to being kidnapped, tied up, gagged, blindfolded, thrown into
[3:00:47.440 --> 3:00:53.800]  a trunk of a vehicle into a dark semi-holler trailer, transported to an unknown location,
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:00:58.480]  carried into an unfamiliar environment, spun around, flipped upside down, disoriented and
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:02.520]  just stashed away, put away for a decade.
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:07.080]  You've been forgotten about now as everyone has moved on and gotten used to life without
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:08.080]  you.
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:11.640]  There's no everyday impact on anything because you're gone.
[3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:16.600]  So imagine this, that people have become used to you, your absence, and you just simply
[3:01:16.600 --> 3:01:18.280]  can't make a difference because you don't exist.
[3:01:18.280 --> 3:01:22.240]  You've been discarded, dispensed, buried for all intents and purposes, you're dead.
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:27.200]  That's exactly what these globalists have done to our entire population.
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:30.920]  All of us are really one kidnapping victim.
[3:01:30.920 --> 3:01:32.080]  We've all been discarded.
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:34.160]  We've all become absent.
[3:01:34.160 --> 3:01:38.800]  We've gotten us all out of their way, forgotten about us, made us irrelevant, and we don't
[3:01:38.800 --> 3:01:43.880]  impact the plan because we've been incapacitated and removed so that we could never be a threat
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:48.360]  to their progress until now.
[3:01:48.360 --> 3:01:52.080]  The light is on and we're all in this room together now.
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:53.400]  We remember the kidnapping.
[3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:58.120]  We have a foggy recollection of what led up to this, right?
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:01:59.720]  We got a good look at the suspects.
[3:01:59.720 --> 3:02:03.080]  We've been able to identify most of them, but it's still unclear really who's behind
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:04.080]  all of it.
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:06.860]  Who told them to come and grab us?
[3:02:06.860 --> 3:02:07.860]  We can make assumptions.
[3:02:07.860 --> 3:02:11.440]  We can theorize because we know what they want.
[3:02:11.440 --> 3:02:12.760]  They want us gone forever, right?
[3:02:12.760 --> 3:02:15.720]  That was the plan, forgot about.
[3:02:15.720 --> 3:02:19.620]  So we know that, but who is they?
[3:02:19.620 --> 3:02:21.840]  We know that they're an enemy.
[3:02:21.840 --> 3:02:23.760]  We know they most likely have a great deal of money.
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:24.760]  They have power.
[3:02:24.760 --> 3:02:25.760]  They have control.
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:26.760]  They have all of these things.
[3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:28.840]  We know that they have a global influence, and the only way to accomplish that is to
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:34.000]  make it worthwhile to the kidnappers because those are the ones risking it all if they're
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  exposed.
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  Is it just money?
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:37.800]  Is there bribery involved?
[3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:39.960]  We talk about the Rothschilds.
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:45.000]  We throw around the Soros name because those people haven't tried to hide their malicious
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  intent.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:49.120]  So we can assume that that's them, that they're a part of this.
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:55.480]  We can assume that they are hands-on in all of this, but can we assume that they're stupid?
[3:02:55.480 --> 3:02:56.480]  Are they really that stupid?
[3:02:56.480 --> 3:02:57.480]  Are they reckless?
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:02:58.480]  Have they gotten themselves in a position?
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:00.200]  I think not.
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:04.160]  Or are they just bold and confident, more likely?
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:09.360]  Does it end with these people, or are those that we thought to be the big fish actually
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:14.520]  subservient to an even higher power?
[3:03:14.520 --> 3:03:18.800]  Or people of faith, if you're here more than likely, you're not a phony.
[3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:23.480]  If you really trust the Word of God and truly believe in the Gospel as the ultimate truth,
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:27.200]  then you know that all lies will be revealed, so we have to go with that.
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:31.520]  As frustrating as it is not knowing his plan, we have no other choice because only he knows
[3:03:31.520 --> 3:03:34.600]  what the future is, so right now we have to deal with what we know.
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:38.440]  Right now we have to work with what he's given us, the tools on our belt, the knowledge
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:42.800]  that we have is the only firepower that we have in our weapons.
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:44.880]  It's the only ammunition that we have.
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:50.400]  And that power is greater than anything that our enemy could ever bring to us.
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:52.320]  And we'll get into more of those facts in just a little bit.
[3:03:52.320 --> 3:03:54.080]  We're going to be talking to that Polish immigrant.
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:55.080]  He's a pastor.
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:03:56.080]  He's now in Calgary, Canada.
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  He's forced those people out.
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:03:58.080]  It's a viral video.
[3:03:58.080 --> 3:03:59.080]  Most of you have seen it.
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:05.960]  But illegal immigration, as we were talking about before we came in here, these migrants
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:09.120]  is not really about the migrants.
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:10.400]  And we know that.
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:15.000]  This isn't about people making their way into the United States so that they can seek asylum
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.800]  or escape oppression or real racism and evil.
[3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:19.480]  There is some of that.
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:21.000]  And those people come through the front door.
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.600]  They're good intended people that want a better life.
[3:04:23.600 --> 3:04:28.800]  The majority, if not all of them, are law-abiding people that scrupulously adhere to the letter
[3:04:28.800 --> 3:04:29.800]  of the law.
[3:04:29.800 --> 3:04:31.040]  But they're looking for a better life.
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:35.360]  They know that the United States is this beacon of light that shines on the world.
[3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:38.280]  And they want to pursue that American dream that they've all heard about.
[3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:40.320]  They've been the victims of communism.
[3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:41.840]  They've lived in fear.
[3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:44.320]  They've risked it all to flee and be here.
[3:04:44.320 --> 3:04:47.800]  Now, a small amount of them were in emergent situations.
[3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:48.800]  And I get that.
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:50.720]  I understand they packed up their belongings.
[3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:51.720]  They jumped aboard a plane.
[3:04:51.720 --> 3:04:52.840]  They climbed into a raft.
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:54.200]  They crawled into a canoe.
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:04:56.080]  They snuck into some shipping container.
[3:04:56.080 --> 3:04:57.080]  They paid a smuggler.
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:04:58.080]  They did whatever it took.
[3:04:58.080 --> 3:05:01.680]  But somehow, they made it the journey here in a moment of desperation.
[3:05:01.680 --> 3:05:03.560]  And now they have arrived.
[3:05:03.560 --> 3:05:07.560]  These aren't the people that we're concerned about, and we all recognize that.
[3:05:07.560 --> 3:05:12.160]  This fake president and the radicals that manipulate him, the ones that are working
[3:05:12.160 --> 3:05:15.760]  while he's sleeping the day away, they're hard at work.
[3:05:15.760 --> 3:05:20.600]  They're encouraging this lawless, criminal, violent MS-13 gangbanger infiltration.
[3:05:20.600 --> 3:05:24.640]  These drug smugglers, these rapists, these killers, these terrorists from around the
[3:05:24.640 --> 3:05:29.760]  world to make their way into the country as part of the continued plan for division.
[3:05:29.760 --> 3:05:37.440]  Confusion, disorientation, it's all needed for a successful kidnapping.
[3:05:37.440 --> 3:05:41.320]  So then you get in this fight-or-flight moment that you can't get out of without a physical
[3:05:41.320 --> 3:05:43.080]  altercation.
[3:05:43.080 --> 3:05:49.240]  Imagine yourself at home sitting down to watch a documentary or preparing the family.
[3:05:49.240 --> 3:05:51.400]  You've popped some popcorn, and you're going to sit down for a movie.
[3:05:51.400 --> 3:05:53.440]  It's movie night at your household.
[3:05:53.440 --> 3:05:55.520]  Something you've been planning, anything.
[3:05:55.520 --> 3:05:57.920]  Giving your undivided attention to something for a period of time.
[3:05:57.920 --> 3:06:01.400]  You set aside the time to perform a task, accomplish a goal, finish a project, install
[3:06:01.400 --> 3:06:04.640]  a light fixture, build something with your kid, sit down, finish a book.
[3:06:04.640 --> 3:06:06.240]  I don't know, whatever it is.
[3:06:06.240 --> 3:06:11.720]  And all of a sudden, the back door is kicked open, boom.
[3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:12.880]  Your home is being invaded.
[3:06:12.880 --> 3:06:13.880]  You're under attack.
[3:06:13.880 --> 3:06:18.880]  There's not a reasonable likelihood at that moment that your attacker is going to allow
[3:06:18.880 --> 3:06:23.000]  you the time to just finish up your movie and put the kids to bed before he launches
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  his assault.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  That's ridiculous.
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:30.000]  He's not going to recognize that he might have come at a bad time and reschedule according
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:32.760]  to your calendar.
[3:06:32.760 --> 3:06:37.960]  The point is, is that there's no way that you cannot be pulled from your planned path
[3:06:37.960 --> 3:06:41.400]  because you have to deal with the unexpected emergency that you're faced with.
[3:06:41.400 --> 3:06:45.000]  It's similar to being out for happy hour with the wife.
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:48.200]  And all of a sudden, approaching your table is the drunken idiot that calls your wife
[3:06:48.200 --> 3:06:50.480]  a whore and pokes you in the chest with his finger.
[3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:51.480]  Come on, dude.
[3:06:51.480 --> 3:06:55.080]  Well, this is a situation that would lead to an immediate altercation, or at least it
[3:06:55.080 --> 3:06:57.580]  should.
[3:06:57.580 --> 3:06:58.580]  So what does this mean?
[3:06:58.580 --> 3:06:59.580]  Why is this important?
[3:06:59.580 --> 3:07:04.800]  Well, these people are distracting you with business closures, social distance mandates,
[3:07:04.800 --> 3:07:06.880]  masking requirements.
[3:07:06.880 --> 3:07:08.200]  The kids are home from school.
[3:07:08.200 --> 3:07:10.520]  The essential worker this and super spread are that.
[3:07:10.520 --> 3:07:14.800]  Well, mass shootings are breaking out across the country at an extremely convenient time
[3:07:14.800 --> 3:07:19.680]  that supports this progressive anti-gun narrative and confiscation grabbing that they're planning
[3:07:19.680 --> 3:07:20.680]  on doing.
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:24.320]  Well, every American citizen is losing everything that they've ever worked for, tens of thousands
[3:07:24.320 --> 3:07:29.400]  of COVID infected, untested, unvetted criminal aliens being handed money and airline tickets
[3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:33.680]  to settle wherever they want to go at the expense of who, you and me.
[3:07:33.680 --> 3:07:37.800]  Meanwhile, the Biden administration is actually torturing Trump supporters.
[3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:40.520]  And this isn't a hyperbolic statement.
[3:07:40.520 --> 3:07:42.400]  You may have seen it at redvoicedmedia.com.
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:45.960]  Vanessa Sousa was talking about this as well.
[3:07:45.960 --> 3:07:50.080]  Actual solitary confinement for anyone that was prosecuted by the Biden feds as a result
[3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:52.560]  of their mere presence on January 6th.
[3:07:52.560 --> 3:07:53.560]  This is real.
[3:07:53.560 --> 3:07:54.560]  And it's happening.
[3:07:54.560 --> 3:07:58.880]  Now, I've talked about some of this unpatriotically correct.
[3:07:58.880 --> 3:08:01.600]  And hopefully you've seen the interviews with actual journalists.
[3:08:01.600 --> 3:08:02.760]  If you haven't, please go watch.
[3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:07.000]  But these are freelance journalists that were simply their documenting, not participating
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:11.240]  in violence, not inciting riots, not encouraging destruction of property, not impeding anything.
[3:08:11.240 --> 3:08:14.520]  No fires were set, no weapons, no assaulted behavior.
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:18.600]  One of them, Sean, he had court this morning after being forced to turn himself in last
[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:19.840]  week, a journalist.
[3:08:19.840 --> 3:08:24.960]  None of this is what you hear about on the major broadcast networks, the cable news media
[3:08:24.960 --> 3:08:25.960]  outlets.
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:28.440]  And that's because these people are part of the plan.
[3:08:28.440 --> 3:08:30.080]  They may want to report real news.
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:32.320]  They may even feel like they are.
[3:08:32.320 --> 3:08:35.640]  But those above them, those dictating the narratives, are part of the kidnapping.
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:39.040]  We're going to talk to that pastor from Calgary.
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:40.120]  He's a Polish immigrant.
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:44.080]  He saw communism for what it really is, and he's up next on Bandness.tv.
[3:08:44.080 --> 3:08:52.480]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[3:08:52.480 --> 3:08:56.920]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[3:08:56.920 --> 3:09:00.400]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:03.360]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:07.160]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:11.880]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[3:09:11.880 --> 3:09:17.640]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[3:09:17.640 --> 3:09:23.880]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[3:09:23.880 --> 3:09:24.880]  the info war.
[3:09:24.880 --> 3:09:29.360]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:30.360]  from them.
[3:09:30.360 --> 3:09:34.360]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again, because the globalists
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:36.800]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[3:09:36.800 --> 3:09:44.280]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there, infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:48.880]  It's hard to believe that we're already in the middle of April and our borders collapsing
[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:53.160]  and world governments being announced and Joe Biden's coming after our guns and trying
[3:09:53.160 --> 3:09:57.840]  to start a war with Russia, but told China they could take over Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:03.680]  So China's done a blockade around Taiwan is threatening to invade Hong Kong, they already
[3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:05.620]  sent troops into Hong Kong.
[3:10:05.620 --> 3:10:10.240]  This is madness and our government's been hijacked now by these globalists and they're
[3:10:10.240 --> 3:10:12.240]  trying to shut us down.
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:17.600]  They took our sponsors away a long time ago, but you sponsor us by buying products direct.
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:21.280]  So these are already great products you need, whether it's vitamin refusion back in stock

[3:10:24.840 --> 3:10:28.000]  50% off when you order them in combos or together.
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:30.880]  But regardless, it funds the info war with the 360 win.
[3:10:30.880 --> 3:10:33.480]  So it was a critical time in history with all this crazy happening.
[3:10:33.480 --> 3:10:36.680]  I want to thank you all for your support and remind you, these are products you and your
[3:10:36.680 --> 3:10:40.680]  family already need and they fund the info war a true 360 win.

[3:10:47.400 --> 3:11:00.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:00.760 --> 3:11:12.840]  You're seeing on the screen there that special report live at 4pm constitutional crisis indisputable
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:17.240]  evidence of widespread deep judicial corruption that'll be exclusively at redvoicemedia.com.
[3:11:17.240 --> 3:11:23.080]  Alex Jones said that he's going to also simultaneously make it available for all of you here.
[3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:24.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:26.240]  My name is Stu Peters of redvoicemedia.com.
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:31.680]  We all saw the viral video of a Canadian pastor that refused to buckle under the pressure
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:36.880]  of intimidation as some sort of government official tried to make her way into our tour
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:41.720]  Pavlowski's church accompanied by the presence of these cops here that you see as a means
[3:11:41.720 --> 3:11:47.360]  to gain compliance from a free man who took a stand for the rights of himself and his
[3:11:47.360 --> 3:11:48.360]  congregation.
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:52.440]  Pavlowski stood between the new aged brown shirts here and demanded that they leave.
[3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:53.440]  He wouldn't back down.
[3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:57.760]  The officers didn't have a warrant to make entry and they reluctantly left after the
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:00.920]  pastor would not allow their admittance according to his rights.
[3:12:00.920 --> 3:12:04.760]  They're provided to him in Canada as they were acting outside the law.
[3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:06.320]  Our tour joins us now.
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:07.320]  Thanks a lot for being here.
[3:12:07.320 --> 3:12:08.320]  We really appreciate it.
[3:12:08.320 --> 3:12:12.320]  Thank you so much for having me.
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:13.320]  Of course.
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:16.040]  I first want to commend you for knowing your rights, for standing up to your rights and
[3:12:16.040 --> 3:12:18.880]  not cowering in the face of that intimidation.
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:24.600]  It looked like a Gestapo style raid on your church stairs and it was during one of the
[3:12:24.600 --> 3:12:28.040]  most celebrated times during Passover.
[3:12:28.040 --> 3:12:29.360]  I'm unprecedented.
[3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:31.640]  Did you know that they would be coming?
[3:12:31.640 --> 3:12:34.440]  No, they didn't tell me that they're coming.
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:36.560]  That's why I was literally shaken.
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:39.480]  I was disturbed deeply.
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:43.120]  When I saw them entering the sanctuary, I just ran.
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:47.760]  I grabbed my telephone and I said to myself, I have to record what they're doing.
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:49.480]  I mean, this is insanity.
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:51.280]  This is crazy.
[3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:52.960]  This is illegal, actually.
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:13:00.000]  They came, apparently they came to enforce a mask bylaw, which is a $100 infraction,
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:05.760]  and they have broken two criminal codes punishable with five years in jail.
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:07.960]  I mean, that's a total insanity.
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:11.360]  So the back of her shirt there says environmental health.
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:14.040]  Is she some sort of a governmental authority?
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:17.000]  Does she have the authority to come in here and just make entry like that?
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  Why?
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:19.600]  Why were they there?
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:23.400]  No, she has absolutely no authority to do that.
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:28.160]  And so the police officers and the peace officers, they had no right to enter.
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:30.560]  We are protected by our constitution.
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:37.200]  Charter rights and freedoms is giving us the authority to have our sanctuary church.
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:42.040]  Church is a holy place and they have no right to enter unless they have a warrant.
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:45.560]  I told them politely first, please go.
[3:13:45.560 --> 3:13:49.080]  They would not move, so everything was intensifying.
[3:13:49.080 --> 3:13:51.280]  And I just kept saying, get out, get out.
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:52.280]  She wanted to talk to me.
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:56.840]  I'm not interested to talk to people that are openly breaking the law.
[3:13:56.840 --> 3:13:58.600]  I mean, that's insanity.
[3:13:58.600 --> 3:14:03.960]  As you know, I grew up under communist dictatorship behind the Iron Curtain, and I've seen, I've
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:10.080]  seen with my eyes exactly what those officers were doing at my church, a total disregard
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:11.080]  to the law.
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:16.240]  They were just coming just because they can, just because they have a gun, lawlessness,
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:20.040]  you know, just coming in because they had the power.
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:24.280]  Get in all the reasons why it's so important where you come from.
[3:14:24.280 --> 3:14:29.960]  Because this is not, look, you're on here, you've been on a lot of these major broadcast
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:30.960]  networks.
[3:14:30.960 --> 3:14:33.000]  The headlines have been all over the place, and this is one of these things that's going
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  to make the news cycle.
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  You're going to see it today.
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  You're going to go, oh, wow, what a great guy.
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  That's a great pastor.
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  And then it's going to be gone tomorrow.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:39.760]  You're never going to see it again.
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:44.120]  But this story has got to stick around for a long time, not because of what happened
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:47.920]  on this day at your church, but because of what has happened previously, and what's about
[3:14:47.920 --> 3:14:50.160]  to happen tomorrow.
[3:14:50.160 --> 3:14:53.840]  But just a couple more questions about this incident in particular, pastor, have they
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:54.840]  been there before?
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:15:00.160]  Have the cops and this woman been to your church before?
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:04.160]  They came before, but they came and they stayed outside of the church.
[3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:06.480]  I've told them you're not allowed to enter.
[3:15:06.480 --> 3:15:07.960]  You have no right to enter.
[3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:10.080]  So they came to the parking lot.
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:14.480]  Once they blocked our parking lot, preventing our parishioners from coming to the church,
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:18.040]  it took us almost an hour to clean the driveway.
[3:15:18.040 --> 3:15:19.800]  Of course, that was illegal as well.
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:25.840]  But this was the first time that they dared to come inside, even though they were told
[3:15:25.840 --> 3:15:31.320]  multiple times to different means, you're not allowed to do that.
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:33.000]  I'll press charges if you do.
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:34.520]  That's a criminal offense.
[3:15:34.520 --> 3:15:35.520]  Don't do it.
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:36.520]  Don't do it.
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:37.520]  And yet they did it.
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:43.600]  Is there a service going on right now as we're looking at them here, they're inside?
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:46.680]  Is there an actual, do you have a congregation here at this point?
[3:15:46.680 --> 3:15:51.240]  Yeah, some of the congregation, not everyone was here.
[3:15:51.240 --> 3:15:54.400]  Choir was starting, prayer group was starting.
[3:15:54.400 --> 3:15:57.960]  So they were all disrupted.
[3:15:57.960 --> 3:16:01.160]  One lady was shaken for three hours after the service.
[3:16:01.160 --> 3:16:06.880]  She says, I'm completely shaken by what I saw, the audacity of those people, the total
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:09.520]  disregard to our rights.
[3:16:09.520 --> 3:16:13.200]  They walked into a restaurant thinking nothing.
[3:16:13.200 --> 3:16:17.680]  Even historically speaking, the Knights during the Middle Ages, they had to leave their swords
[3:16:17.680 --> 3:16:18.680]  outside.
[3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:20.120]  They were not allowed to come to the temple.
[3:16:20.120 --> 3:16:23.720]  They were not allowed to come to the cathedral, to the church.
[3:16:23.720 --> 3:16:26.000]  They would leave their swords outside.
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:28.680]  But those people just don't care anymore.
[3:16:28.680 --> 3:16:31.240]  I mean, it's total lawlessness.
[3:16:31.240 --> 3:16:37.240]  And I grew up in a country that had such a total lawlessness that those people could
[3:16:37.240 --> 3:16:38.240]  do whatever they want.
[3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:42.680]  They could break the door at your house five in the morning, arrest you, beat you, torture
[3:16:42.680 --> 3:16:48.280]  you, throw you in jail, and the judges would not support you because the judges were corrupted
[3:16:48.280 --> 3:16:49.280]  as well.
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:52.080]  It was the party line, constitution didn't matter.
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:57.480]  As you know, Poland was the second country on the planet earth just after the United
[3:16:57.480 --> 3:17:00.640]  States of America that implemented constitution.
[3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:03.680]  We are one of the few countries that elected kings.
[3:17:03.680 --> 3:17:08.840]  So for Polish people, freedom is very important, it's very dear to us.
[3:17:08.840 --> 3:17:12.360]  But during communism, they didn't care about our rights.
[3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:14.560]  They didn't care about the constitution.
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:16.000]  Everyone was breaking the law.
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:20.480]  50,000 communists were ruling over 36 million Poles.
[3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:22.720]  So this video here was taken during Passover.
[3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:26.320]  This was a few a week ago or so.
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:28.280]  And you pushed them out.
[3:17:28.280 --> 3:17:30.960]  What's then have they come back?
[3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:34.280]  They didn't come back and they didn't contact with me at all.
[3:17:34.280 --> 3:17:36.520]  I have few friends in the police.
[3:17:36.520 --> 3:17:39.520]  So I talked to them and they said it's a gong show.
[3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:45.260]  They get hundreds of thousands of phone calls right now and they actually redirect the phone
[3:17:45.260 --> 3:17:48.000]  call to another detachment.
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:49.200]  They are not answering.
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:50.880]  They're not making any comments.
[3:17:50.880 --> 3:17:53.360]  The mayor is not making any comments.
[3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:54.960]  They completely closed the doors.
[3:17:54.960 --> 3:17:56.160]  They didn't contact with me.
[3:17:56.160 --> 3:17:57.840]  They didn't apologize to me.
[3:17:57.840 --> 3:18:02.800]  They made a little lame statement the day after saying, oh, they were just doing their
[3:18:02.800 --> 3:18:08.000]  job pretty much and they wanted to make sure that it's going to be done peacefully is like
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:10.160]  I have a record of violence.
[3:18:10.160 --> 3:18:11.960]  You know, I'm doing this for 22 years.
[3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:15.240]  I'm feeding the homeless people in the name of Jesus Christ on the street.
[3:18:15.240 --> 3:18:17.880]  I have never, ever attacked anyone.
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:20.600]  I have no criminal record and they know it.
[3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:26.160]  This is just pure intimidation, pure harassment is forceful submission.
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:29.800]  They want you to submit or else.
[3:18:29.800 --> 3:18:35.280]  You have almost a million dollars in fines that you are looking at that you are facing
[3:18:35.280 --> 3:18:39.440]  for so-called COVID violations, almost a million dollars.
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:40.440]  It's unprecedented.
[3:18:40.440 --> 3:18:44.680]  I mean, folks, this harassment that's been happening here, the pastor who says that they
[3:18:44.680 --> 3:18:49.440]  told them that they were just doing their job, just doing their job is exactly right.
[3:18:49.440 --> 3:18:51.760]  What job is it that they're actually doing?
[3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:54.200]  That's, see, this is what we have to pay attention to.
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:55.200]  Look at this.
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:56.680]  Look at all of these.
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:19:00.440]  Every one of these things here that he's holding up here is a fine earned fraction totaling
[3:19:00.440 --> 3:19:05.680]  nearly a million dollars as they came in here in a Gestapo style raid.
[3:19:05.680 --> 3:19:07.760]  What has been the reaction in about 20 seconds here?
[3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:11.920]  What's been the reaction of your parishioners, of your congregation?
[3:19:11.920 --> 3:19:13.080]  Operations are standing strong.
[3:19:13.080 --> 3:19:15.680]  They say it doesn't matter what the government will do.
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:17.440]  We're coming to the service.
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:19.720]  We will not back away.
[3:19:19.720 --> 3:19:24.920]  You know, the response from the public though, unbelievable, Americans, I have tens of thousands
[3:19:24.920 --> 3:19:29.560]  of phone calls and emails, unbelievable support, you know, like people saying, you know, waiting
[3:19:29.560 --> 3:19:34.080]  for a spot set up whole new division over there at that police department to deal with
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:35.080]  all of this.
[3:19:35.080 --> 3:19:36.080]  I hope that they do.
[3:19:36.080 --> 3:19:37.920]  And I hope that the people continue to call.
[3:19:37.920 --> 3:19:38.920]  We're going to be back with a pastor.
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:41.520]  Stick around with me because we're going to talk about something really important right
[3:19:41.520 --> 3:19:42.520]  after this.
[3:19:42.520 --> 3:19:43.760]  Spam this dot TV.
[3:19:43.760 --> 3:19:48.760]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:48.760 --> 3:19:54.360]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[3:19:54.360 --> 3:19:56.160]  and for word of mouth.
[3:19:56.160 --> 3:19:57.160]  And then we're all this together.
[3:19:57.160 --> 3:20:01.120]  And I, you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I've got great products,
[3:20:01.120 --> 3:20:02.960]  please bomb or we won't be here on air.
[3:20:02.960 --> 3:20:03.960]  But it's true.
[3:20:03.960 --> 3:20:07.680]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:20:07.680 --> 3:20:11.640]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:20:11.640 --> 3:20:12.640]  everybody else.
[3:20:12.640 --> 3:20:14.960]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:20:14.960 --> 3:20:19.480]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:20:19.480 --> 3:20:21.000]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:23.120]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:23.120 --> 3:20:26.920]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America's still quasi free.
[3:20:26.920 --> 3:20:31.440]  And you can't have info wars has been proven right, be on air with all the craziness that's
[3:20:31.440 --> 3:20:32.440]  about to unfold.
[3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:34.760]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:34.760 --> 3:20:39.760]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[3:20:39.760 --> 3:20:40.760]  and so much more.
[3:20:40.760 --> 3:20:42.520]  They're wonderful products and they support the info.
[3:20:42.520 --> 3:20:43.520]  We're thank you.
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:48.440]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April, 2021.
[3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:49.440]  And I just want to say something.
[3:20:49.440 --> 3:20:53.800]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[3:20:53.800 --> 3:20:54.800]  the years.
[3:20:54.800 --> 3:20:58.480]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the
[3:20:58.480 --> 3:20:59.480]  listeners of this show.
[3:20:59.480 --> 3:21:03.760]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are
[3:21:03.760 --> 3:21:06.320]  Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got red blood.
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:11.600]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:15.960]  and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:16.960]  over the years.
[3:21:16.960 --> 3:21:20.400]  And as crazy as your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:23.960]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:29.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:31.360]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:34.960]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[3:21:34.960 --> 3:21:40.000]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.920]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:43.920]  God bless.
[3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:47.720]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[3:21:47.720 --> 3:21:53.160]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:54.880]  down to nothing.
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:59.240]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:02.880]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[3:22:02.880 --> 3:22:10.080]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[3:22:10.080 --> 3:22:12.360]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[3:22:12.360 --> 3:22:15.200]  The enemy can't help itself.
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:19.280]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:23.280]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it.
[3:22:23.280 --> 3:22:24.280]  We should.
[3:22:24.280 --> 3:22:29.960]  But once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and
[3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:34.760]  attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[3:22:34.760 --> 3:22:36.920]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[3:22:36.920 --> 3:22:40.600]  You're going under the judge but just like all the children that were aborted, this
[3:22:40.600 --> 3:22:42.240]  is the truth.
[3:22:42.240 --> 3:22:43.240]  This is the InfoWars.
[3:22:43.240 --> 3:22:46.840]  I actually bought this at Blocks UHS Frequency.
[3:22:46.840 --> 3:22:52.200]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[3:22:52.200 --> 3:22:59.320]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with
[3:22:59.320 --> 3:23:01.400]  or without a battery.
[3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:07.400]  Now with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:08.400]  Excellent.
[3:23:08.400 --> 3:23:14.040]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[3:23:14.040 --> 3:23:18.920]  And you can too at infowarstore.com.
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:26.120]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking
[3:23:26.120 --> 3:23:29.320]  your every move through your mobile phone.
[3:23:29.320 --> 3:23:34.640]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:47.400]  The InfoWars, and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today, InfoWarsstore.com.
[3:23:47.400 --> 3:23:52.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:52.400 --> 3:24:06.760]  Not going to want to miss that special report live at 4 p.m. Eastern immediately following
[3:24:06.760 --> 3:24:07.760]  this broadcast.
[3:24:07.760 --> 3:24:12.120]  The constitutional crisis of Governor Ronda Santos is living and listening in Florida.
[3:24:12.120 --> 3:24:16.400]  He's going to be made aware of a complete judiciary overhaul that is required in that
[3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:17.400]  state.
[3:24:17.400 --> 3:24:22.120]  So back with the pastor, when we're discussing trigger words, pastor like communism and fascism,
[3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:27.680]  and when we're talking about takeovers and gulags or genocide, concentration camps and
[3:24:27.680 --> 3:24:30.600]  things like that, these ideas are no longer fringe.
[3:24:30.600 --> 3:24:35.480]  These aren't conspiracy theories and it's not some radio host just saying some shocking
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:40.600]  words for the sake of likes and clicks and followers, retweets and echoes and upvotes.
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:46.800]  You've come from this place and I think that you have an actual warning for Americans and
[3:24:46.800 --> 3:24:48.320]  for people in Canada right now.
[3:24:48.320 --> 3:24:53.240]  Do we have all of the telltale signs of a totalitarian toppling of our entire political
[3:24:53.240 --> 3:24:55.680]  system going on right before our eyes?
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:24:58.760]  Sir, communism is not coming.
[3:24:58.760 --> 3:24:59.840]  Communism is already here.
[3:24:59.840 --> 3:25:01.920]  We see it left and right.
[3:25:01.920 --> 3:25:03.600]  And this is not just idle threat.
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:07.520]  I mean, growing up behind the Iron Curtain, I can smell it.
[3:25:07.520 --> 3:25:08.520]  I can see it.
[3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:10.200]  And the tactics are identical.
[3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:15.000]  The takeover of the mainstream media, the propaganda machinery of other, you know, of
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:20.920]  other Hitler, Gabels, communism, Pravda, I mean, I grew up under this and I see it left
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:21.920]  and right.
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:22.920]  It's a scary thing.
[3:25:22.920 --> 3:25:23.920]  We have to unite.
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:24.920]  We have to stand up.
[3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:29.080]  We have to push this together while we still have that window of opportunity.
[3:25:29.080 --> 3:25:35.240]  This is no more a time that we can wait and, you know, watch everything from sitting on
[3:25:35.240 --> 3:25:36.240]  a fence.
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:38.440]  This is a time to jump either left or right.
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:42.080]  You've got to choose this day whom you're going to serve.
[3:25:42.080 --> 3:25:46.320]  He was mentioned by General Michael Flynn, you know, over the weekend, an emergency broadcast.
[3:25:46.320 --> 3:25:48.320]  They called it spars instead of SARS-CoV-2.
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:50.120]  I mean, this thing has been talked about.
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:53.400]  It's been predicted that they were going to use health and safety, that they were going
[3:25:53.400 --> 3:25:54.560]  to use fear.
[3:25:54.560 --> 3:25:57.080]  You look at somebody like Hitler, somebody like Stalin.
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:02.960]  These people loved these people before he then destroyed their people, his people, both
[3:26:02.960 --> 3:26:03.960]  of them.
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:08.720]  So, I mean, are we seeing kind of a Stockholm syndrome here where people are falling in
[3:26:08.720 --> 3:26:13.320]  love with or the idea of trusting their captors, their kidnappers, as I kind of laid it out
[3:26:13.320 --> 3:26:15.840]  before you were on?
[3:26:15.840 --> 3:26:17.440]  That's exactly what is happening.
[3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:24.200]  You know, somehow for the past 34 years, 50 years, the indoctrination was so, so huge
[3:26:24.200 --> 3:26:29.120]  everywhere at our universities by our politicians and mainstream media.
[3:26:29.120 --> 3:26:31.520]  So, somehow people are dependent.
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:33.400]  They are dependent on the light.
[3:26:33.400 --> 3:26:35.760]  They're dependent on the government officials.
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:40.160]  They think that the government officials are their saviors and they walked away from the
[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:46.560]  true savior, Jesus Christ, and now we're in this big, big trouble because history is teaching
[3:26:46.560 --> 3:26:49.320]  us that this does not end well.
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:51.760]  We got to push this away.
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:26:54.040]  And without a single shot being fired.
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:59.680]  We've talked about this at Nazium almost until you want to vomit that this warning has been
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:00.680]  given.
[3:27:00.680 --> 3:27:04.680]  So, when you see people like, I know you're in Canada, but when you see us dealing with
[3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:08.880]  this in the United States of America, when you see this insurgents at the border, you
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:12.000]  realize that this is not due to a humanitarian crisis.
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:15.080]  It's because there's a crisis on the hands of the deep state here.
[3:27:15.080 --> 3:27:16.080]  They're being exposed.
[3:27:16.080 --> 3:27:19.040]  The kidnappers, if you will, are being identified.
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:22.920]  And those kidnappers that are being directed by whoever it is that's holding the money
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:25.000]  to power the influence, they're becoming informants.
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:28.360]  They're flipping on them because they can see that the end is nearing them.
[3:27:28.360 --> 3:27:32.200]  They're in panic mode, which is why you see people like Alex Jones being shut down and
[3:27:32.200 --> 3:27:33.200]  banned.
[3:27:33.200 --> 3:27:37.560]  They don't believe that Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist, but it's because it's important
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:39.720]  for them to make you think that.
[3:27:39.720 --> 3:27:43.040]  So now, as Alex often says, we're all here because we're part of the resistance and later
[3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:47.080]  we'll talk about real destruction of the people like Alex and people like me.
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:52.960]  But we don't have, Pastor, time left to play games with these people, with this masking
[3:27:52.960 --> 3:27:56.440]  with these business closures, with these distractions, do we?
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:27:57.720]  No, we don't.
[3:27:57.720 --> 3:28:00.160]  We don't have, at all.
[3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:01.240]  We don't have time.
[3:28:01.240 --> 3:28:05.360]  Right now we have to stand up, like I said, there is this window of opportunity to push
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:10.440]  this evil because even they know that they cannot pull this off if they're going to wait
[3:28:10.440 --> 3:28:11.440]  for too long.
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:16.760]  That's why you got shutdowns, second wave, third wave, variant this, variant that, even
[3:28:16.760 --> 3:28:21.440]  though the data is not proving or showing what they're saying is true, but they're pushing
[3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:25.920]  this agenda because they know that sooner or later people will wake up.
[3:28:25.920 --> 3:28:28.680]  Germans, many of them woke up, but it was too late.
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:33.640]  Baja was already built, Auschwitz-Birkenau was already built, and they were on their
[3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:36.440]  way there because they waited for too long.
[3:28:36.440 --> 3:28:40.840]  Now, then you're either not paying attention or you're in that ignorant state of denial
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:43.400]  where you just don't want to believe that this stuff could possibly be true.
[3:28:43.400 --> 3:28:47.080]  You don't want to believe that Trump supporters are actually being tortured.
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:48.080]  This isn't hyperbole.
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:52.520]  They're actually being held in solitary confinement, every single one of them that was arrested
[3:28:52.520 --> 3:28:57.480]  for just their mere presence at a rally, at a peaceful and patriotic rally.
[3:28:57.480 --> 3:29:01.120]  Those that were not participating, they could have been on the complete other side pastor
[3:29:01.120 --> 3:29:05.800]  of the complex, not even inside of that building, and they're being rounded up fervently sought
[3:29:05.800 --> 3:29:06.800]  out.
[3:29:06.800 --> 3:29:11.080]  Meanwhile, you have millions and millions of Americans that are being subjected to violence
[3:29:11.080 --> 3:29:13.440]  all summer long on the streets of our cities.
[3:29:13.440 --> 3:29:19.140]  We watched as anti-American political groups actually cemented shut doors of occupied police
[3:29:19.140 --> 3:29:23.520]  departments and lit fire to them, intending to burn police officers alive.
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:26.320]  These are people with families at home.
[3:29:26.320 --> 3:29:30.600]  And we're talking about a group of 80 million people that are being targeted, jailed and
[3:29:30.600 --> 3:29:32.800]  tortured for political beliefs.
[3:29:32.800 --> 3:29:36.640]  We can't sit on our hands while millions of unknown people come waltzing into our house
[3:29:36.640 --> 3:29:38.600]  with malicious intent.
[3:29:38.600 --> 3:29:40.880]  And that's why I wanted your comment on what's going on at the border.
[3:29:40.880 --> 3:29:43.320]  I mean, you wouldn't stand for it in your church.
[3:29:43.320 --> 3:29:44.600]  No, no, no.
[3:29:44.600 --> 3:29:49.240]  I mean, the message for all those people that are saying, let's not build the wall.
[3:29:49.240 --> 3:29:50.760]  Let's not protect our borders.
[3:29:50.760 --> 3:29:53.280]  Would you invite all of those people into your home?
[3:29:53.280 --> 3:29:58.200]  I mean, if that's the case, let's let's get all the homeless people into your house tomorrow
[3:29:58.200 --> 3:29:59.520]  and see how you feel.
[3:29:59.520 --> 3:30:00.920]  We have to protect our doors.
[3:30:00.920 --> 3:30:04.240]  We have to keep the doors locked because that's your privacy.
[3:30:04.240 --> 3:30:05.240]  That's your sanctuary.
[3:30:05.240 --> 3:30:07.320]  Your country should be well protected.
[3:30:07.320 --> 3:30:09.000]  But let me say something to you.
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:13.320]  Those are the same tactics that I witnessed from the stories of my grandparents about
[3:30:13.320 --> 3:30:14.440]  the Nazis.
[3:30:14.440 --> 3:30:19.200]  The same tactics I've seen when I was growing up behind the Iron Curtain, this civilization
[3:30:19.200 --> 3:30:25.240]  of economics, elimination of anyone that dares to say anything contrary to the party
[3:30:25.240 --> 3:30:26.240]  line.
[3:30:26.240 --> 3:30:27.240]  We're seeing it.
[3:30:27.240 --> 3:30:28.240]  That's why those people are tortured.
[3:30:28.240 --> 3:30:32.360]  That's why they are being arrested because they want to eliminate any descent from the
[3:30:32.360 --> 3:30:33.360]  party line.
[3:30:33.360 --> 3:30:35.600]  They want to destroy America.
[3:30:35.600 --> 3:30:36.600]  Mark my words.
[3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:37.720]  I see it coming.
[3:30:37.720 --> 3:30:39.080]  They want to wipe you out.
[3:30:39.080 --> 3:30:41.280]  They want to enslave the population.
[3:30:41.280 --> 3:30:46.000]  And what's what's more shocking, they're doing it in front of your eyes.
[3:30:46.000 --> 3:30:49.360]  It's already started.
[3:30:49.360 --> 3:30:51.880]  Those are some really shuddering words.
[3:30:51.880 --> 3:30:57.000]  It just makes you it makes you shiver to think about this actually happening.
[3:30:57.000 --> 3:31:04.280]  And the warning has been going out for such a long time from people who were labeled French,
[3:31:04.280 --> 3:31:10.080]  labeled conspiracy theorist, tin foil hat wearing Donald Trump bootlicking ass kissers.
[3:31:10.080 --> 3:31:16.560]  Excuse my French pastor, but that's what's been happening here and people have actually
[3:31:16.560 --> 3:31:22.200]  been cast out of their social groups and walked away from for the political divide.
[3:31:22.200 --> 3:31:27.000]  So the polarization and the separation of people not only being done in the physical
[3:31:27.000 --> 3:31:32.960]  nature by the by the so-called planned edemic as they tell us, no, you can't gather with
[3:31:32.960 --> 3:31:35.160]  your friends and your family members.
[3:31:35.160 --> 3:31:38.880]  These congregations have to be limited in size and you can't worship God.
[3:31:38.880 --> 3:31:43.400]  At the same time, you can go and burn down a police precinct or loot a business or hold
[3:31:43.400 --> 3:31:45.160]  people for ransom in their alleyways.
[3:31:45.160 --> 3:31:46.160]  They're not allowed.
[3:31:46.160 --> 3:31:49.760]  You can have an autonomous zone set up here with just pure lawlessness and chaos going
[3:31:49.760 --> 3:31:51.160]  on.
[3:31:51.160 --> 3:31:54.640]  What I wanted to ask you before we go here, and I know that you're busy and I got to
[3:31:54.640 --> 3:31:56.480]  get on in the next segment here before we go to break.
[3:31:56.480 --> 3:32:00.440]  But I wanted to ask you about the indoctrination of children behind the iron curtain.
[3:32:00.440 --> 3:32:02.040]  Did that start to take place as well?
[3:32:02.040 --> 3:32:07.280]  Because we're seeing a ton of that here with this critical race theory about how our children
[3:32:07.280 --> 3:32:11.360]  in the United States are being taught that if they're white, they're the devil.
[3:32:11.360 --> 3:32:14.720]  Did stuff like that take place as well with the indoctrination of the young, impressionable
[3:32:14.720 --> 3:32:16.560]  minds and ears?
[3:32:16.560 --> 3:32:17.560]  Of course.
[3:32:17.560 --> 3:32:20.920]  Divide and conquer, that's what's happening.
[3:32:20.920 --> 3:32:25.000]  Divide and conquer families, divide the families, isolate families.
[3:32:25.000 --> 3:32:31.760]  When I was growing up, I was told these famous words, in Russian language, that means grandpa
[3:32:31.760 --> 3:32:32.760]  Stalin.
[3:32:32.760 --> 3:32:36.520]  We were told that he was the savior of the world, that he was the best thing that ever
[3:32:36.520 --> 3:32:37.520]  happened.
[3:32:37.520 --> 3:32:44.000]  Now we know 60 million people were murdered by this creature, and it's happening all over
[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:45.000]  again.
[3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:46.000]  I mean, that's a scary thing.
[3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:51.720]  It's happening all over, and my childhood was not that long ago, Adolf Hitler was in
[3:32:51.720 --> 3:32:53.360]  power not that long ago.
[3:32:53.360 --> 3:32:55.320]  Have we learned nothing?
[3:32:55.320 --> 3:32:57.120]  I mean, this is scary.
[3:32:57.120 --> 3:33:03.240]  Pastor Artura Pavlowski, you're a brave person, and I want to thank you.
[3:33:03.240 --> 3:33:07.880]  This is an immediate warning of imminent danger for everybody in the West, for everybody
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:10.160]  that enjoys the illusion of freedom that we have.
[3:33:10.160 --> 3:33:11.160]  Thank you for your time, sir.
[3:33:11.160 --> 3:33:12.160]  God bless you.
[3:33:12.160 --> 3:33:13.160]  Thank you.
[3:33:13.160 --> 3:33:14.920]  God bless you, too.
[3:33:14.920 --> 3:33:19.160]  As we come back in just a few minutes, we're going to talk about how to deal with the kidnappers
[3:33:19.160 --> 3:33:21.040]  that we've talked about.
[3:33:21.040 --> 3:33:26.120]  We're going to talk more about that indoctrination as they try to choke out every last remaining
[3:33:26.120 --> 3:33:33.480]  pro-conservative, pro-Trump, pro-freedom, liberty-embracing, God-fearing, Christian-American
[3:33:33.480 --> 3:33:34.480]  that's left here.
[3:33:34.480 --> 3:33:37.680]  And if they can't come after you or me or Alex Jones is of the world, then they're going
[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:41.880]  to come after your kids because they know that they can as we continue on VanNess.tv.
[3:33:41.880 --> 3:33:43.440]  This is the Alex Jones show.

[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:52.360]  In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[3:34:52.360 --> 3:34:57.360]  Before I had an access to your show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought,
[3:34:57.360 --> 3:34:58.360]  man, that looks fun.
[3:34:58.360 --> 3:35:02.760]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[3:35:02.760 --> 3:35:03.760]  because you're real.
[3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:05.760]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:06.760]  We're not worthy!
[3:35:06.760 --> 3:35:07.760]  We're not worthy!
[3:35:07.760 --> 3:35:13.720]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[3:35:13.720 --> 3:35:16.920]  these topics are so huge, they're so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[3:35:16.920 --> 3:35:19.040]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[3:35:19.040 --> 3:35:20.720]  The globalists love lying to you.
[3:35:20.720 --> 3:35:22.040]  They love manipulating you.
[3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:24.680]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[3:35:24.680 --> 3:35:29.440]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[3:35:29.440 --> 3:35:32.040]  That for me is really set down and disgusting.
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:38.080]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[3:35:38.080 --> 3:35:39.080]  the globalists.
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:43.960]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:49.120]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person, and so as bad as things are with
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:52.560]  the globalists attacking humanity, and all the terrible things that are unfolding, I
[3:35:52.560 --> 3:35:57.280]  want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[3:35:57.280 --> 3:36:00.880]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that no public doesn't get to see, and let
[3:36:00.880 --> 3:36:06.480]  me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:12.360]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:17.360]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:19.920]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:24.280]  You fund us, you support InfoWarsTour.com, you get great privacy at the same time.
[3:36:24.280 --> 3:36:28.840]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will
[3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:34.080]  target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[3:36:34.080 --> 3:36:39.440]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:41.920]  shock groups in the information war.
[3:36:41.920 --> 3:36:44.080]  Fund us at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:52.400]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[3:36:52.400 --> 3:36:56.880]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:00.320]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[3:37:00.320 --> 3:37:03.280]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[3:37:03.280 --> 3:37:07.080]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[3:37:07.080 --> 3:37:11.800]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[3:37:11.800 --> 3:37:17.520]  If you go to InfoWarsDomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:23.760]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[3:37:23.760 --> 3:37:28.840]  the InfoWars and then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:29.840]  that you get from them.
[3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:34.240]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists
[3:37:34.240 --> 3:37:36.680]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:41.080]  So InfoWarsDomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[3:37:41.080 --> 3:37:47.360]  InfoWarsDomains.com, take action now.
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:38:02.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:07.280]  That's special report at redboysmedia.com live at 4pm Eastern time of immediately following
[3:38:07.280 --> 3:38:11.400]  this constitutional crisis, indisputable evidence of widespread deep judicial corruption.
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:15.440]  My name is Stu Peters from redboysmedia.com, guest host in the final hour of the Alex Jones
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:16.800]  show at bandness.tv.
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:23.320]  We talked with the pastor, just an absolutely amazing story and it's quite revealing.
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:28.640]  It's quite shaking but not necessarily frightening, not for me because we've been here.
[3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:33.800]  We've been here on top of every tall building or mountain that we can climb on top of with
[3:38:33.800 --> 3:38:37.040]  the loudest bullhorns that we can try to grab.
[3:38:37.040 --> 3:38:38.200]  You've been warning about this.
[3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:40.080]  I know that you have too.
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:43.960]  And so what do we do if we're not going to stand for it?
[3:38:43.960 --> 3:38:46.880]  That seems to be the big question is, well, what do we do now?
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:50.640]  If you wouldn't stand for it in your house, if you wouldn't allow an intruder to come
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:38:54.200]  in without some sort of a reaction, if you wouldn't allow it in your church when we talk
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:58.060]  to the pastor who didn't allow it for him, this health inspector accompanied by the brown
[3:38:58.060 --> 3:39:03.560]  shirts because it's deeper, they're choking us out and we're taking our last breaths.
[3:39:03.560 --> 3:39:05.920]  According to the pastor, this is it.
[3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:06.920]  It's here.
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:11.960]  If we don't take action right now, we're done.
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:13.440]  This is an emergency, folks.
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:17.360]  I'm not saying that for shock value.
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:23.800]  This is imminent danger right here in front of our face.
[3:39:23.800 --> 3:39:27.200]  The silencing has been done.
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:30.760]  The disarming is underway.
[3:39:30.760 --> 3:39:34.720]  The jailing is taking place.
[3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:38.720]  And we see these people locked up, like Sean Witzman, the journalist that I was telling
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:39.720]  you about.
[3:39:39.720 --> 3:39:40.720]  I interviewed him on Patriotically Correct.
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:43.320]  He had to turn himself into the FBI.
[3:39:43.320 --> 3:39:46.040]  They told him in the morning, they said, you have till the end of the day to turn yourself
[3:39:46.040 --> 3:39:48.200]  in to the FBI.
[3:39:48.200 --> 3:39:52.640]  And we look at these people and we just pray, right, and we say, well, they'll have their
[3:39:52.640 --> 3:39:53.640]  day in court.
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:59.800]  And if they didn't do anything wrong, well, what do they have to worry about?
[3:39:59.800 --> 3:40:04.440]  But what if we don't have the courts?
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:08.400]  Our quiet executive action was taken by Adolf Biden today.
[3:40:08.400 --> 3:40:11.680]  I saw it here at redvoicemedia.com.
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:20.040]  He's created a Supreme Court commission to take a look at the way the high court operates.
[3:40:20.040 --> 3:40:26.160]  This includes considering the expansion of the size of the court, adding justices.
[3:40:26.160 --> 3:40:30.160]  Again, we have warned about this.
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:35.160]  This is why the new statehoods are being pushed.
[3:40:35.160 --> 3:40:38.160]  And folks, this is why they want our guns so bad.
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:43.000]  Because when we talk to somebody like Pastor Artur Pavlowski, and when we talk with one
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:46.840]  another, whether it's here at this platform or whether it's on the phone or via text or
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:51.640]  on the streets or whatever means that we have now, the communication superhighway is running
[3:40:51.640 --> 3:40:52.640]  rampant.
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:55.400]  We can talk to each other on telegram and signal all over the place.
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:40:59.720]  But when we talk with each other and we always say, what do we always say, when they come
[3:40:59.720 --> 3:41:02.440]  for the guns, that's it.
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:06.880]  Don't let me get involved, says the Vietnam War veteran that's sitting in his easy chair
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:09.760]  drinking his whiskey at the end of every night.
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:10.760]  When they come for the guns, that's it.
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:13.840]  That'll be the tipping point.
[3:41:13.840 --> 3:41:18.560]  Richard Leonard, my partner at work, we chased some of the most violent offenders together
[3:41:18.560 --> 3:41:21.440]  for over a decade.
[3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:23.440]  He is a brother to me, by the way, happy birthday, Richard.
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:24.920]  It was his birthday yesterday.
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:31.200]  He is a brother to me, and we have oftentimes predicted falsely or wrongly what the tipping
[3:41:31.200 --> 3:41:34.320]  point was actually going to be.
[3:41:34.320 --> 3:41:37.120]  When they make us mask for more than 15 days, that'll be it.
[3:41:37.120 --> 3:41:39.960]  Nobody's going to stand for that.
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:42.800]  When they tell us that we can't get together for the holidays, that'll be it.
[3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:43.800]  That's it.
[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:46.440]  Nobody's going to stand for that.
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:49.600]  When they take our kids out of school, oh, yeah, that'll be it.
[3:41:49.600 --> 3:41:55.560]  Oh, wait till they make our kids start wearing masks while they're exerting themselves playing
[3:41:55.560 --> 3:41:59.560]  sports, that'll be it.
[3:41:59.560 --> 3:42:01.120]  But it's never it.
[3:42:01.120 --> 3:42:04.680]  When they come for our guns, that's it.
[3:42:04.680 --> 3:42:15.920]  The United States represents 4.25% of the world population at about 331 million.
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:23.440]  I think it's 331 million, 2,651 documented people.
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:26.720]  And I don't know why I remember that number, folks.
[3:42:26.720 --> 3:42:27.720]  It's a weird brain up here.
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:32.280]  If you could just be inside of this head for 30 minutes or 30 seconds, it would explode.
[3:42:32.280 --> 3:42:33.280]  I'm convinced.
[3:42:33.280 --> 3:42:42.280]  But in 2018, it was estimated that U.S. civilians alone account for 393 million of the worldwide
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:48.000]  total of civilian-held firearms, which is about 46%.
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:53.120]  So 4.25% of the world possesses nearly 50% of the guns.
[3:42:53.120 --> 3:42:57.880]  Now that doesn't include, because that's from 2018, remember, that doesn't include the record-smashing
[3:42:57.880 --> 3:43:00.840]  number of new firearms obtained over the last year here in America.
[3:43:00.840 --> 3:43:04.480]  You see how many permits, there's stories all over the place, how many permits to carry
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:08.640]  were issued, how many background checks were done by the FBI for people that want to acquire
[3:43:08.640 --> 3:43:12.160]  a permit to purchase or a permit to carry, it's unprecedented.
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:13.160]  And I love it.
[3:43:13.160 --> 3:43:14.160]  I think it's great.
[3:43:14.160 --> 3:43:20.640]  Every single American who can legally or lawfully possess or carry a gun ought to be doing it.
[3:43:20.640 --> 3:43:25.080]  Because every single day we say to ourselves, well, I don't need a gun, or I'm unfamiliar
[3:43:25.080 --> 3:43:28.200]  with a gun, or I don't feel comfortable with a gun, and that's fine.
[3:43:28.200 --> 3:43:31.480]  But if you aren't familiar or comfortable with a gun, you ought to go get one and get
[3:43:31.480 --> 3:43:35.440]  to the range and start working with it until you are, because we all know that the only
[3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:38.720]  defense against a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, and it's never going to happen
[3:43:38.720 --> 3:43:41.600]  to you until it does.
[3:43:41.600 --> 3:43:48.960]  I have been there, I have been to a fast food restaurant when I was taking my family to
[3:43:48.960 --> 3:43:53.840]  a hockey game, and I walked into the restroom while the rest of the family was going to
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:43:54.840]  order something.
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:44:01.240]  I had the guy come up behind me wielding the knife and tell me to give him everything.
[3:44:01.240 --> 3:44:06.320]  And I put my hands up like this, and I said, okay, I said, you want everything, I got it,
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:09.640]  I got it, and my back is to him, right, because I'm at the urinal.
[3:44:09.640 --> 3:44:12.800]  And he's behind me, and he's got this knife out, and I can see him, because I'm looking,
[3:44:12.800 --> 3:44:17.360]  I'm turning back over my shoulder, I can see him there, give me everything.
[3:44:17.360 --> 3:44:23.680]  I said, okay, I'm going to reach in really slow, I'm going to reach in really slow here.
[3:44:23.680 --> 3:44:26.320]  And I said, are you sure you want everything?
[3:44:26.320 --> 3:44:28.680]  And as I'm reaching, are you sure you want everything?
[3:44:28.680 --> 3:44:31.400]  And I spun around, and I pointed a gun in his face, and I'm going to tell you something,
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:34.840]  that guy dropped that knife, ran out of a shoe, ran out of the restaurant, there happened
[3:44:34.840 --> 3:44:38.800]  to be a squad car there, they chased him, they arrested him.
[3:44:38.800 --> 3:44:43.480]  But if I had not had that gun, I'm a victim.
[3:44:43.480 --> 3:44:48.160]  And I'm just telling you to not die a worthless pile of crap that can't defend yourself or
[3:44:48.160 --> 3:44:52.200]  your family, find some means of protection.
[3:44:52.200 --> 3:44:57.120]  The number is much higher now, and I don't have the raw data to give you about how many
[3:44:57.120 --> 3:45:01.560]  gun owners there are, but going back to my idea about the courts, we have to notice this,
[3:45:01.560 --> 3:45:05.640]  we have to pay attention, because today, immediately following this broadcast, again, I'm dropping
[3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:10.720]  that expose, but the evidence being given to the court of public opinion might, although
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:15.440]  be it might force a constitutional crisis, that's not going to happen overnight.
[3:45:15.440 --> 3:45:17.400]  But if we don't have the courts, we have nothing.
[3:45:17.400 --> 3:45:19.240]  Family courts are corrupted, and we know that.
[3:45:19.240 --> 3:45:25.880]  We've seen children stripped away from their mothers over masking.
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:32.000]  Criminal courts are dismissing cases for rioting anti-American insurgents and violent domestic
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:40.480]  terrorists that participated in the destruction of entire cities all summer long, while chasing
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:45.760]  down Trump-supporting grandmas that took a selfie at the Capitol on the 6th of January.
[3:45:45.760 --> 3:45:48.720]  So the kidnapping has taken place, and we can recognize that.
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:57.320]  We're going to get deeper into that, and what this so-called Stockholm syndrome means.
[3:45:57.320 --> 3:46:01.600]  Because it can be a really dangerous thing, as our tour Pavlowski pointed out to us, when
[3:46:01.600 --> 3:46:07.320]  people start to say, well, maybe this mask will just work.
[3:46:07.320 --> 3:46:10.880]  Maybe it's really not that big of a deal to just wear this mask for a little while.
[3:46:10.880 --> 3:46:11.880]  It's a minor setback.
[3:46:11.880 --> 3:46:14.720]  It's a minor inconvenience.
[3:46:14.720 --> 3:46:19.880]  Maybe the vaccination really isn't all that bad.
[3:46:19.880 --> 3:46:21.160]  We've mentioned the amount of guns here.
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:26.160]  We mentioned the hunt for those guns, and how they'll do anything to incapacitate us.
[3:46:26.160 --> 3:46:27.660]  And they will.
[3:46:27.660 --> 3:46:29.480]  And I want you to think about something before we go.
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:32.600]  But first, up next is the war room with Owen Schreuer.
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:34.760]  I want to ask him what's going on over there.
[3:46:34.760 --> 3:46:37.800]  Owen, what do you got on the war room this afternoon, sir?
[3:46:37.800 --> 3:46:42.480]  Well, we've got some just staggering numbers coming from the southern border.
[3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:47.040]  And when you look at it on a line graph, it's even more shocking.
[3:46:47.040 --> 3:46:50.400]  It shows you, I mean, it's like clown level.
[3:46:50.400 --> 3:46:53.480]  The graph, as soon as Biden gets in, just goes off the charts.
[3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:55.840]  I mean, it's literally off the charts.
[3:46:55.840 --> 3:46:58.400]  Here's just a brief preview if you want to see that.
[3:46:58.400 --> 3:47:03.840]  You can see here, literally right when Biden gets in, it goes off the charts.
[3:47:03.840 --> 3:47:05.320]  So they said they were going to surge the border.
[3:47:05.320 --> 3:47:06.320]  They are.
[3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:09.440]  They get caught engaged in human smuggling, child trafficking.
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:14.960]  And now we have the lady that we filmed multiple times, bringing children to the airport, bringing
[3:47:14.960 --> 3:47:17.640]  people to the airport from the Catholic centers.
[3:47:17.640 --> 3:47:24.280]  We've identified a tattoo on her leg that is a known MS-13 gang tattoo.
[3:47:24.280 --> 3:47:29.480]  So somebody may be interested to look into that, this woman is driving children to and
[3:47:29.480 --> 3:47:34.320]  from the airport with an MS-13 gang tattoo on her calf.
[3:47:34.320 --> 3:47:37.040]  And every time cameras are around, seems to get nervous.
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:41.520]  And once the camera is shut off, so that is going to be one of the major stories that
[3:47:41.520 --> 3:47:42.520]  we cover.
[3:47:42.520 --> 3:47:43.520]  Pretty big deal, though.
[3:47:43.520 --> 3:47:46.520]  Joe Biden yesterday said that America doesn't have a bill of rights.
[3:47:46.520 --> 3:47:47.560]  Did you notice that?
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:51.600]  No amendment to the Constitution is final.
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:55.720]  That's kind of a big thing for the president to say, we don't have a bill of rights.
[3:47:55.720 --> 3:47:56.720]  All that.
[3:47:56.720 --> 3:47:59.440]  And now the new commission to talk about packing the courts.
[3:47:59.440 --> 3:48:00.720]  We've been warning about this, Owen.
[3:48:00.720 --> 3:48:03.920]  We've been telling everybody, this is coming, it's going to happen.
[3:48:03.920 --> 3:48:07.840]  And my final thought on this, and maybe I'll get your opinion on this, the Stockholm Syndrome
[3:48:07.840 --> 3:48:09.080]  is real.
[3:48:09.080 --> 3:48:12.000]  My final thought today was, I was thinking about last night as we're considering the
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  millions of people that are just allowing this to happen to us, and maybe it's because
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:18.920]  they're uninformed or ignorant to the plan, but Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response
[3:48:18.920 --> 3:48:24.200]  that occurs when hostages or abuse victims bond with their captors or abusers.
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:27.120]  And I think a lot of people, Owen, are starting to do that.
[3:48:27.120 --> 3:48:29.440]  My warning is here, resists.
[3:48:29.440 --> 3:48:31.200]  And if you're here, you're part of the resistance.
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:32.200]  Have a great show, Owen.
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:33.200]  Thanks for joining me today.
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:34.200]  My name is Steve.

[3:49:33.680 --> 3:49:39.040]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[3:49:39.040 --> 3:49:43.440]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[3:49:43.440 --> 3:49:47.720]  the years, and it's truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:48.720]  you, the listeners of this show.
[3:49:48.720 --> 3:49:51.880]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you.
[3:49:51.880 --> 3:49:55.520]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you got red
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:49:56.520]  blood.
[3:49:56.520 --> 3:50:01.200]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:05.600]  and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:06.600]  over the years.
[3:50:06.600 --> 3:50:09.920]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[3:50:09.920 --> 3:50:13.560]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:50:13.560 --> 3:50:18.600]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:50:18.600 --> 3:50:20.960]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:24.560]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:25.560]  done.
[3:50:25.560 --> 3:50:30.080]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully
[3:50:30.080 --> 3:50:32.400]  God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for us.
[3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:33.400]  God bless.
[3:50:33.400 --> 3:50:41.920]  Thank you.
