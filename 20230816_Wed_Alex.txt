[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.560]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.560]  Center.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:55.800]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas and U.S. resistance against
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.520]  a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega-banks
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.480]  that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.800]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.960]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.360]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.440]  This is all confirmed.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.560]  This is not a drill.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.400]  Big tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.880]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880]  Apple, 100%.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.640]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.520]  They are now beta testing, using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520]  to do that.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520]  This is happening.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.000]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.280]  and censorship, thinking you would adapt the censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.280]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.280]  previous attacks.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.280]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280]  subversion paradigm manipulation.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.280]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.280]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.280]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.280]  infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.280]  Global Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.280]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.280]  inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.280]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chicon slash big tech begging combine emergency situation.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.280]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.280]  been battering ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.280]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.280]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.280]  So they take what I've said being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.280]  I'm personally cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.280]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.280]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.280]  all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.280]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.280]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum is being used against you.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.280]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.280]  I have given you the transmission.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.280]  Now break free!
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:42.280]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:59.280]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:18.280]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.280]  because we are effective.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.280]  The great awakening is here.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.280]  Go to band.video.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.280]  Download the videos and share.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.280]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.280]  And never give up the fight.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.280]  Infowars.com
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.280]  Coffee has not been available at infowarsstore.com for two years
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.280]  because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.280]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.280]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away,
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.280]  we finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.280]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.280]  It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:35.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available at infowarsstore.com exclusively.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.280]  Escape the prison planet light roast.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.280]  Tastes great, it's the strong one.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280]  Really strong.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.280]  But these are all close second and third.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.280]  Medium roast, wake up America.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.280]  Woo! That's what my go-to.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.280]  Dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very strong.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280]  Gives you that pep.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.280]  They're all three available at infowarsstore.com and they fund our operation.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.280]  And each order gets a pocket Constitution citizen rule book.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.280]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.280]  My way.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.280]  Tell your children not to hear my words.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.280]  What they mean, what they say.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.280]  Mother.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.280]  Mother.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.280]  Can you keep them in the dark for life?
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.280]  Can you hide them from the waiting world?
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.280]  Oh, mother.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.280]  Father.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.280]  Gonna take your daughter out tonight.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.280]  Gonna show her my world.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.280]  Father.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.280]  And I'm about to see your light.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:14.280]  But if you wanna find hell with me, I can show you what it's like.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:22.280]  Till you're bleeding, I'm not back to see your light.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:31.280]  But if you wanna find hell with me, I can show you what it's like.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280]  We are live.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.280]  Mother.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.280]  Wednesday.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.280]  Tell your children not to hold my hand.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.280]  August 16th, 2023.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.280]  Tell your children not to understand.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.280]  Oh, mother.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.280]  All right.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.280]  I have held my tongue since the Lajana firestorm.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.280]  I've been there four times, know the area well.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.280]  I've talked to locals in the last few days.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.280]  I've done deep research.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:17.280]  And I can now unequivocally say that the state and county and city are 100% guilty for what happened there.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:25.280]  It's either criminal negligence or it's completely deliberate.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:34.280]  Now, for anyone that knows about management of the roads and the towns and cities and rural areas of this country,
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.280]  and if you're in Wisconsin or you're in Texas or you're even in places like New York,
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:47.280]  when you drive down the road, you notice that the trees are cut back 10 feet or more from the power lines.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.280]  There's a lot of reasons for that.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.280]  When it freezes and some of the branches fall off, you don't want a tree falling on the power lines,
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.280]  because there's power going through them and it causes big fires.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:08.280]  Or if there is high winds, a tornado or hurricane, it can knock the power lines down,
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.280]  and then that causes a firestorm.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:19.280]  But if you let in the most expensive real estate on earth, and that's that area of Maui,
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.280]  but locals have been there for hundreds of years, so it's mainly mom and pops,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.280]  if you do not trim back the brush,
[00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:44.636]  we've got a big article on Infowars.com right now overwhelming evidence proves that falling power lines into trees and brush cause that firestorm. We'll put the article on screen in a moment.
[00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:55.668]  Nowhere, even in third world countries, you're in Mexico, they trim the trees back from the power lines.
[00:09:55.668 --> 00:10:05.668]  So in comes a hurricane without rain, 70 mile an hour winds, and if you pull up a Google map of that area, of Maui,
[00:10:05.668 --> 00:10:23.668]  Lina, and you look, it's a thin sliver of houses and businesses that's only about 400 yards to 200 yards thick.
[00:10:23.668 --> 00:10:30.668]  And there's high powered power lines that run up and down the island to the other towns
[00:10:30.668 --> 00:10:37.668]  that run right along the back side of the town.
[00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:45.729]  That's the wealthy area that you see right there on screen that did not get burned down.
[00:10:45.729 --> 00:11:01.329]  If you pull up a Google map and just pull up the whole town, it was the commercial and old district where the Royal Family lived for thousands of years and where the original little church is and the famous British post office.
[00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:11.130]  And that's why the Hawaiians took the British flag when they had their independence from England was that was the only flag they knew at the little post office there in the town.
[00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.130]  Now all destroyed except for the stone church that had a park around it.
[00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:33.250]  So, high powered lines on the highway and on the sub access road and on the roads directly abutted up against the town were hit with 70 mile an hour winds.
[00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:44.250]  Now, when 70 mile an hour winds come in, have you ever noticed when a hurricane hits, they tell you get ready for power outages? It's because they turn the power off.
[00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:53.250]  Ever wondered right as a hurricane starts blowing in and the winds go past 50, 60 miles an hour, what happens to the power? Why do they tell you to evacuate?
[00:11:53.250 --> 00:12:09.250]  Because they're going to cut the power. Because if any power lines get knocked down that have juice going through them, especially if it's dry, it's going to cause a giant fire.
[00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:17.250]  And that's why all the witnesses described it and we have video of it, of a woman and her children in an apartment right on the beach.
[00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:24.250]  And she says, she has a chronological video we're going to play in a moment, she says let's get out of here.
[00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:38.250]  And they barely make it five minutes later as they are getting on the road and they just see the whole place go up in flames because power transformers and the power lines are white hot on the ground exploding.
[00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:49.250]  And so in a matter of minutes, power lines all over the roads fell with full juice going through them.
[00:12:49.250 --> 00:13:02.250]  So let's go through this. They didn't remove the brush, the photos, the videos or legion, the highway department, the county department and the city.
[00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:10.250]  All the citizens that survived and their houses survived, they did have yards, they did trim the brush.
[00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:16.250]  So they didn't trim the brush all around the town. They didn't trim it up on the road.
[00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:24.250]  And they left the power on and it's confirmed what was reported three days ago because I waited until it was confirmed in the news.
[00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:33.250]  They did cut the water four hours before the hurricane hit, the hurricane winds.
[00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:52.250]  So they didn't need arsonists which they've already arrested some previously in that area last year to go set these fires because the city and the county and the state,
[00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:59.250]  because one highway state, it's only about 500 yards from the edge of town or less.
[00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:12.250]  And then the county road right there on the back of the town, zero cutting of the trees and brush.
[00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:21.250]  Power lines fall because trees were falling on them in the 70 mile an hour wind.
[00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:26.250]  They're running with juice. Boom! Fire!
[00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:32.250]  And there's all those different lines coming in. So imagine you're sitting there in your house.
[00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:37.250]  They tell you stay home from school that day. Most of the parents are out doing stuff.
[00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.250]  Okay, 70 mile an hour winds. Most people are just watching TV or staying in.
[00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:46.250]  All of a sudden you hear explosions. You go on your back porch and you see fire.
[00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:52.250]  A few minutes later, it's already burned through several blocks.
[00:14:52.250 --> 00:15:02.250]  The mother says, let's get out of here. She gets in the car and barely makes it through as the neighborhood right next to her is engulfed in flame.
[00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.250]  They didn't trim the brush. They didn't cut the power. They cut the water.
[00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:15.250]  There were no emergency sirens. They have them there for fires and for tsunamis.
[00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.250]  There's no way that government was that incompetent.
[00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.250]  They've had the globalists licking their lips, declaring they're going to make it a smart island.
[00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:29.250]  They have a conference coming up in just a week and a half.
[00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:34.250]  Oprah Winfrey and Zuckerberg and all of them have been saying they've been trying to force people to sell their land.
[00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.250]  They did it.
[00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.250]  I believe they did it on purpose.
[00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:55.250]  And there's a precedent in this many cases in history of where elites deliberately burn out poor populations to take premium real estate like the great fire of Rome and Nero.
[00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.250]  We'll be back.
[00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:05.250]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available.
[00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:10.250]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.250]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:22.250]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.250]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:34.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.250]  It is game changing.
[00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.250]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.250]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund or operation a 360 win.

[00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.250]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:22.250]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.

[00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.250]  They're all very diverse.
[00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.250]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years.

[00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.250]  Info wars.
[00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:05.250]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.250]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:38.210]  All right, I made a lot of the key points at the fire in Valley.
[00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:43.210]  It was 100% preventable and 100% allowed to happen.
[00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.230]  We have total proof.
[00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.290]  Wasn't space lasers.
[00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.910]  It was massive brush and trees allowed to grow up all over the high tension power lines
[00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:59.070]  out on the state highway and on the branches of the power grid going into the town.
[00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.110]  Hundreds of transformers blew up.
[00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.110]  The trees fell on the lines with juice going through them.
[00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.270]  They turned the water off.
[00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.690]  The alarms didn't go off.
[00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.690]  The emergency services were nowhere to be found other than a few police helping evacuate
[00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.530]  people and it gets worse.
[00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:22.170]  The same police officer that ran the Vegas investigation banned the media yesterday from
[00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:31.050]  12 miles out and said we should dox everyone that tries to get in and show what's going
[00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:36.950]  on and they blocked aid from coming in to the town from other locals.
[00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.050]  This is insane.
[00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.050]  This is a cover up.
[00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:46.590]  They want to be a smart grid is the second most expensive real estate in the world.
[00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:55.330]  We have video of all of this and Jason Jones who lives in between Hawaii and Texas.
[00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.570]  Really smart reporter veteran.
[00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.570]  He's there.
[00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.410]  I talked to him last night.
[00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:01.530]  He confirmed all of this.
[00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:11.970]  He is in Maui and he is getting into the town of Lahaina right now.
[00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.810]  He will be joining us during the war room today and he will be on my show tomorrow.
[00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.290]  He said he can get more done and he comes on later.
[00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.730]  He is there right now.
[00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:24.570]  He's been arrested during the lockdowns when they tried to stop his protest to end the
[00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.570]  lockdowns.
[00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:26.570]  This guy doesn't play games.
[00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.570]  He's a badass.
[00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.870]  Jason Jones is on the scene.
[00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.590]  Quite frankly, I was firing up to get on a plane and go there.
[00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.790]  I didn't think of Jason Jones.
[00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.630]  He called me yesterday from Hawaii.
[00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:45.409]  So, he's not playing games, and the local's loving, and he's married to a local, so he
[00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:47.450]  is pissed, and he's going in.
[00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:51.290]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:57.970]  So, this is a big deal, and it's illustrative.
[00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.330]  I want to tie this into something we're going to get to later, and I had it in my stat
[00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.330]  crew and I can't find it.
[00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.649]  I sent it to you on Twitter this morning.
[00:23:05.649 --> 00:23:13.970]  Facebook openly announced that they are banning anyone connecting windmills, giant windmills,
[00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:19.210]  to whale deaths, record whale beaching on the East Coast around these things, and the fishermen
[00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.730]  and marine biologists are all reporting the same thing.
[00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.770]  Prestigious groups are reporting it.
[00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:30.330]  Facebook now says they're banning anyone talking about dying marine life like whales.
[00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.970]  So, it doesn't matter what agenda it is to destroy us.
[00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:39.290]  They are blocking us discussing the Afghan withdrawal, open borders, fentanyl, human
[00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.690]  trafficking, ivermectin working, hydroxychloroquine working.
[00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.889]  The FDA came out last week and said, okay, we've got over 100 studies.
[00:23:46.889 --> 00:23:48.850]  It turns out ivermectin is incredible and stops COVID.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:24:07.700]  2014, there's the article right there on the whales, 2014, Fauci put out a study on ivermectin working on SARS, the same virus family.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:16.700]  He also put out a study in 2014 that masks don't work and give you bacterial pneumonia. But hey, what to do, huh? He knows directly what he's doing.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.700]  So this is how they administratively kill us. They turn off our energy. They turn off our power. They turn off our police.
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:26.700]  They won't cut down the trees around the power lines. They got plenty of money because they're stealing it.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:35.100]  Anybody, I don't care if you live in Oklahoma or anywhere other than California and a few
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.179]  other areas, this is the same damn thing in California where unless it's rich people's
[00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:44.500]  areas or government institutions, they don't cut the trees back from the frickin' power
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:52.260]  lines. And just as easy as one, two, three, you get 70 mile an hour winds with a bunch
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:58.899]  of brush and trees that fall on live power lines with electricity going through them,
[00:24:58.899 --> 00:25:02.220]  they're going to fall and start burning the ground. Then the electricity is going to back
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.820]  up into the transformer in a few minutes and it's going to go BOOM!
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:18.240]  And that's why people are online saying, well, satellite video and local videos show explosions,
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:25.760]  it was space lasers. No, it was transformers backing up because the power lines hit, they
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.240]  sizzle, they burn out, they stop conducting, the electricity goes back into the transformer,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:41.800]  BOOM! That's why we got all these videos coming up of BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:53.200]  A transformer is a bomb. It's full of chemicals. It's able to regulate the power at times and
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.680]  redirect it, but once they juice up, just like an electric car that malfunctions, guys,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.200]  pull up footage of an electric car. Oh, by the way, they're now admitting electric cars
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:09.080]  that they want to make Hawaii go 100% to by law. California's already doing it. Let's pull
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:15.120]  up some footage of electric cars blowing up. And what do you think happened when all the
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:21.080]  fire hit those electric cars because Hawaii's full of them? I was there this year on two
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.560]  I'd say 40% of the cars are electric.
[00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:33.390]  What do you think happened when the fire hit those? People were like, why are these
[00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:39.210]  cars blown up? Why are these cars, look at them, they're Teslas and they're other electric
[00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:46.570]  cars. By the way, China just dumped 5 million cheap electric cars on the US. I have seen
[00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:52.370]  in just the last three days hundreds of these damn Chinese little bitty, they look
[00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:58.450]  like little smart car cardigos or tiny little tin cans and they're electric and they're
[00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:07.170]  time bombs. So that town and other towns that burned in Maui were from power lines with
[00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:11.830]  trees falling on them full of juice, the water turned off, but not the electricity
[00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:19.450]  turned off. So in between the transformers, the live power lines and electric cars, that's
[00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:24.690]  why there were so many explosions because if you look at the videos of the burned out cars,
[00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:28.770]  you'll see a Chevy truck, it's just melted and burned. You'll see an old van, it's just
[00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:34.970]  melted and burned. But right next to it will be an exploded car with pieces all over the
[00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:46.650]  place and it's smart cars, it's electric cars, giant time bombs. And no wonder they
[00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:54.410]  don't want anybody to go in there and look and examine and see what happened because they're
[00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:59.770]  covering it up and Oprah Winfrey and Bill Gates and Zuckerberg are already saying, well,
[00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:05.010]  we're going to make this a community center in an open area and have high-rises there now.
[00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:10.610]  Bill Gates wants to put, he's already got five of them he owns in Hawaii,
[00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:16.050]  yeah you know he owns four seasons, he's putting in all these four seasons there
[00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:20.770]  and he's already said last year he wanted to put a four seasons in there and the townspeople
[00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:26.050]  are still in control with their city council and they would not sell the land.
[00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:36.650]  Bill Gates as usual, hold my beer. And that's what they've done all over the country where the
[00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:42.490]  left is under control, they do not trim the trees and they know that that is a firestorm
[00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:50.970]  waiting to happen, administrative mass murder. The great reset, welcome to the new world order
[00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:56.010]  but people are awake and they're pissed and just like with COVID the global has been off

[00:31:55.490 --> 00:32:02.650]  spear in the fight. The globalists are only humans. Yeah, they have control of the central
[00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.409]  banks. They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations
[00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:10.330]  are going to take decades to stop. But one thing you can do right now is take control
[00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:15.810]  of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook
[00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:20.810]  with. And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there. This thing does
[00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:25.690]  10,000 gallons. You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day. It purifies
[00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.530]  very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.090]  This is what I use, which my family uses. It's the very best system out there for the
[00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:38.810]  lowest price for a limited time. 10% off on top of that exclusively at Infowarsstore.com

[00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:52.490]  one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from
[00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.210]  hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply. In some cases they add
[00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.650]  the water supply like fluoride.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:06.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:37.730]  Alright, this situation in Maui is a big deal because it gives you the mindset of the globalist.
[00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:47.730]  Now what they do is they authorize and support ineptitude by local city, county, and state governments.
[00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:52.730]  They defund police. They allow crime to get completely out of control.
[00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:59.730]  They undermine the family. They undermine savings. They jack up the prices. They destabilize the world.
[00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.730]  Mike Cernovich wrote on Twitter today,
[00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:08.730]  the Rwandan genocide happened overnight. One day people woke up and couldn't leave.
[00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:13.730]  They were chopped up with machetes by the millions, run by the UN and the Clintons.
[00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.730]  I added that part. And he went on to say,
[00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:22.730]  before the genocide went live, there was a period of dehumanization led by the media,
[00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:29.730]  debunking and prosecutions of the Christian minority because of their Christianity in the last 200 years.
[00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.730]  Less than 10% of the population had 90% of the wealth.
[00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:38.730]  And they simply hired the other African tribes to murder almost every single one of them.
[00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:42.730]  When they tried to flee, the UN set up machine gun nests to kill them.
[00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:47.730]  The UN all over the world goes in, in Asia and in Africa particularly,
[00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:55.730]  and will just murder whole villages of thousands that don't sign up with their land for lithium and cobalt mines.
[00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.730]  So they've done this all over the world and gotten away with it.
[00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.730]  And they're testing giving us poison shots. They're testing releasing viruses.
[00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:07.730]  They're testing cutting off pipelines and gas and fuel and creating inflation
[00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:12.730]  to create the angrier world to then organize the starving masses
[00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:18.730]  into launching their great reset that is the controlled collapse of civilization.
[00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:24.730]  So there's a cover up in Maui, in Lahaina.
[00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.730]  They know that they didn't trim the trees. They know the trees and bushes fell on the power lines.
[00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.730]  They know they let the power on. They know they turned the water off.
[00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:36.730]  They know they didn't issue the alarms. They know they let the whole thing happen.
[00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:41.730]  And then the police chief who ran the Vegas cover up in my view,
[00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.730]  you know that thing was a cover up.
[00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:50.730]  He's magically there right after they failed to buy the town out from out of the people.
[00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:55.730]  They're saying the town's worth five and a half billion dollars.
[00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:02.730]  But once they build high rise hotels, it'll be worth three or four times that.
[00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.730]  And we already have the governor announcing that's the plan and Oprah all the rest of them.
[00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:11.730]  This is disgusting. And Hawaii is the greatest example of a bunch of billionaires,
[00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:15.730]  over a hundred of them, that have moved into all the major islands
[00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:19.730]  and are pushing everybody else out.
[00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:24.550]  They want it as their own private preserve.
[00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.550]  So we're going to go through some of these clips that I've told you about.
[00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.550]  We always show you what we talk about, but let me read.
[00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:41.650]  A really good comment on Twitter by Wall Street Apes, at Wall Street Apes. Now listen to this,
[00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:52.130]  you can roll some b-roll while I read it. Conspiracy theories, conspiracy theorist, conspiracy theorist
[00:36:52.130 --> 00:37:04.090]  are just people capable of pattern recognition. Maui fires Hawaii, must read. Hawaiian government
[00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:10.010]  states their goal is to rebuild the entire island of Maui, the first smart island. They
[00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:16.610]  want the entire island governed by AI. It's outlined in the Hawaii digital summer of 2023,
[00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:21.570]  I have all the documents. They plan to host the summer event.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:29.760]  September 25th of 2023 in Maui. What a coincidence, just in a week and a half.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:37.760]  Last year in Maui, there was a convention pushing Maui to go all electric and pushing 15-minute smart cities.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:45.760]  Contact made last year to build high-rise condo complexes and businesses in Lahaina, which is a historic town,
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:56.760]  and couldn't have any new development in this area, but now it's demolished, so now they can rebuild. What a coincidence.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:05.760]  Now there's a 12-mile media-free zone around Lahaina, Maui, where the wildfires struck.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:14.760]  The Maui police chief, John Pelletier, was also the incident commander during the Las Vegas mass shooting.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:21.760]  Now he has the largest emergency alert siren system in the entire world. It didn't activate the alarms.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.760]  The water was turned off. The electricity was left on. Schools were closed.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:36.760]  The water system was completely failed before the fire hit, so people couldn't keep the fires away from their homes.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:46.760]  Water systems always fail when they burn down document storage facilities, housing Wall Street court documents all the time.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:55.760]  Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Lady Gaga, Oprah Winfrey, Jim Carrey, Will Smith, Julia Roberts, billionaire Larry Ellison, all didn't have their mansions torched.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.760]  They were all just fine. All just a bunch of big old coincidence.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:07.760]  Klaus Schwab, the WEF World Bank Forum, globalist in Black Rock, owned the power company.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.760]  Black Rock owns it. I'll show you that document in a moment.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:19.760]  But instead of just telling you about it, how convenient! Hawaii governor reveals state plans to acquire the land, ravaged by wildfires.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:30.760]  Let's go ahead and go to the governor and then play the police chief back to back, kicking the media out and any aid to the locals so they can cover up the crime scene. Here it is.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:38.760]  This is what Governor Josh Green had to say along with the FEMA director about preserving Lahaina moving forward.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:46.760]  I'm already thinking about ways for the state to acquire that land so that we can put it into workforce housing, to put it back into families,
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.760]  or to make it open spaces in perpetuity as a memorial to people who were lost.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:58.760]  We want this to be something that we remember after the pain passes as a magic place.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.760]  And Lahaina will rebuild. The tragedy right now is the loss of life.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.760]  The buildings can be rebuilt over time. Even the banyan tree may survive.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:18.760]  But we don't want this to become a clear space where then, yes, people from overseas just come and decide they're going to take it.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.760]  The state will take it and preserve it first.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:40.760]  So of the 89, so realize this, when we find these, you know, our family and our friends, the remains we're finding is through a fire that melted metal.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.760]  We have to do rapid DNA to identify them.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.760]  Every one of these 89 are John and Jane Doe's.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.760]  And so when you are asking us and we we know we've got to get.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.760]  And I love the way our our House representative, how she said it, she was so eloquent.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.760]  We know we've got to go quick, but we've got to do it right.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.760]  So when we pick up the remains and they fall apart.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:17.760]  And so when you have 200 people running through the scene yesterday and some of you.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.760]  That's what you're stepping on. I don't know how much more you want me to describe it.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:29.760]  That's what you're stepping on. Give us a little bit of time to contain that.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:38.760]  Please, because we've got to go make 89 notifications and coming from a place that had to make 58.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:45.760]  I understand the pain this is going to take and we're not done with 89.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:51.760]  So just understand what this thing is, because none of us really know the size of it yet.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:59.760]  Everybody wants a number. You want it fast or you want it right. We're going to do it right.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.760]  And they went on officially to ban everybody back from 12 miles.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.760]  They're trying to kick out people that even live there.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.760]  So they can then bring in the bulldozers and do what they do.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.760]  Even CNN admits Hawaii has a robust emergency siren warning system.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.760]  It sat silent during the deadly wildfires.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.760]  So the government doesn't trim back the trees. They charge you taxes for they leave the power on.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.760]  They cut the water off. They don't turn the emergency sirens on.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.760]  And then he talks about dead bodies. Let's honor the dead.
[00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:36.770]  They're already putting red axes on the buildings they're about to start demolishing. They're
[00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:42.530]  taking it, just like the U.S. government took Hawaii away at gunpoint, and now the billionaires
[00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:47.570]  wanted for themselves, and now they're going to take it from everybody again. History
[00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:55.810]  repeats itself. We get to the great fire of Rome coming up, and most historians believe
[00:42:55.810 --> 00:43:01.930]  Nero burned it down because he wanted to expand his palace and a new coliseum and racetrack.
[00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:11.730]  But let's start going through the clips now. Let's go ahead, and this guy cusses a little
[00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:18.010]  bit. We've bleeped this, haven't we? But what he's saying is totally true, and he
[00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.170]  shows the documents. He shows the video. I've gone and checked it all, debunking the
[00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:27.050]  space laser situation, pointing out, no, it's leaving trees, leaving brush, not trimming
[00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:32.370]  them, letting them fall, keeping the power on. That's what did it. That's the explosions,
[00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:37.210]  not laser beams from space. Laser beams don't cause explosions.
[00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:45.190]  The way transformers do. Here's the video. Do you know how the wildfires in Hawaii actually
[00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:49.470]  started and who's actually trying to cover it up? Because if you've seen this image circulating
[00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:54.470]  around TikTok or Twitter, I got news for you. Alien space lasers make for great clickbait
[00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:58.390]  conspiracy theories, but that's actually just a photo of a Falcon 9 launch and you
[00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:01.790]  wouldn't have even needed to leave TikTok to figure that out. And honestly, the truth
[00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:11.270]  is just as f***ed up. You don't need to make up alien stuff. I'll tag the creator that
[00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:15.110]  reposted that video in the comments. She also does a great breakdown of a lawsuit you should
[00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:19.390]  check out. If you're curious, Maui Electric Company is owned by HECO, which is actually
[00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:23.430]  Hawaiian Electric Industries, which is owned by our favorite friends. And if you go to
[00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:27.910]  Hawaiian Electric Company's own website, they have a whole section about tree trimming
[00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:32.910]  safety. You know, just in case some trees might be a fire hazard, they can maybe fall
[00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.310]  down on some power lines that allegedly didn't get shut off and a bunch of crazy f***ing
[00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:41.910]  wind and allegedly didn't get shut off after the fires had already started. Maybe they
[00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:45.750]  should have read their own f***ing website because in windy weather, unattached tree
[00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:50.509]  limbs can be blown onto power lines and cause problems. Yeah, some f***ing problems.
[00:44:50.509 --> 00:44:56.029]  A 10-foot minimum clearance from the lines is required for safety purposes. I also point
[00:44:56.029 --> 00:45:00.150]  out that they are legally required to maintain their facilities and equipment, i.e. their
[00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:03.870]  power lines. Vegetation management is one of the many efforts Hawaiian Electric uses
[00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:08.350]  to help ensure the reliability of your electric service. We regularly inspect trees
[00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:12.549]  growing near power lines and contact certified vegetation management crews to trim trees.
[00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:18.630]  Hmm. We will always include a reasonable margin of safety above the absolute minimum clearance
[00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:23.190]  requirements, which are 10 feet clearance from the lines. Yeah, that's about 10 feet,
[00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.790]  right? Like, give or take. So, I wonder who these guys put in charge of this company.
[00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:31.750]  Well, it's this guy, Scott Sue. Yeah, nice shirt, bud. Really blending in there. Mr.
[00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.270]  Sue is an innovative business leader. As president of Hawaiian Electric, Mr. Sue was
[00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:39.270]  responsible for ensuring reliable, safe, and affordable provision of electric power
[00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:44.710]  to 95% of Hawaii's population. F***ing good job, bud. You f***ed that one up.
[00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:50.069]  But I thought it was worth noting that in 2020, he made $2.5 million. And in 2021,
[00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:55.110]  he made about $3 million. But he was doing such a damn good job of that, that he figured
[00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:59.670]  he needed a $1 million pay raise in 2022. So, if you need a conspiracy theory to explain
[00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:03.830]  the Hawaiian fires, you don't have to go start making alien bullsh**. Because it's honestly
[00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:08.150]  a lot more f***ed up to acknowledge the fact that big money is just doing what big money
[00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:12.710]  does and electing more big money hotshots to make their big money payday and do their
[00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.870]  bullsh** big money jobs they don't do. So, I feel like it's a much more productive use
[00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:22.150]  of our time to stop making up stupid theories about photos of Falcon 9 rockets and to start
[00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:27.750]  looking at the real people that are really responsible. Because 2023 is pretty f***ed up,
[00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:33.350]  but fires still don't start themselves. All right, and he said alleged. It's not alleged.
[00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:37.350]  The Washington Post, the New York Times even admit the power was left on, the sirens were
[00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.069]  never turned on, the water was cut off. And now the police chief says you can't come
[00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:45.590]  into the area and they want the locals out and no aid is going to be basically given.
[00:46:47.029 --> 00:46:51.190]  You see that? Now, I'm going to play this video for radio listeners. I'll
[00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:56.230]  narrate it. But here is a woman with her children in an apartment on the beach.
[00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:02.230]  She sees the fires. We have more video coming up of the explosions. You can see in the tree
[00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:08.470]  lines on the power poles. Trees fall, they start burning, the electricity lines start shorting
[00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:14.950]  out. It backs up, transformers explode, bigger fires. You leave the power lines on.
[00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:24.230]  In a hurricane, you get this, especially if you have it trim the trees. This is like a chemistry
[00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:29.590]  experiment. And you put two chemicals together that are going to react, they're going to explode.
[00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:34.230]  And that's what those transformers are. Here's the video.
[00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:50.470]  So high winds start coming in. See, it's all sunny. Smoke's not there yet.
[00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.390]  She received a call from a co-worker
[00:47:54.390 --> 00:48:02.710]  that brush fires have started. After 30 minutes, they begin questioning the smoke.
[00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.790]  There's no sirens, no warnings.
[00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.550]  This is the moment they realize they got to get out of there. Less than 100 yards away,
[00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:21.750]  they see houses on fire. No sirens are going off. Now there's smoke everywhere and high winds.
[00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:24.950]  She gets her children to get to the car.
[00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:35.750]  To the power lines are down. Fires everywhere from the power lines.
[00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:45.750]  Officer stops them and urges them to use the bypass because the other road was blocked.
[00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:51.430]  Go drive down the bypass for a minute and just see how far we go and just see what happens
[00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:55.430]  and then we can just come back up and turn around because it's just the open highway.
[00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.350]  These are hellish scenes of the fire from a distance.
[00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:02.710]  You couldn't look anywhere without seeing fires and explosions.
[00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:05.670]  We couldn't believe what was happening to our town.
[00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:11.350]  They deliberately let all the brush and trees grow up because the locals wouldn't sell.
[00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:17.270]  And then they turned off all the emergency services and the sirens.
[00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:25.430]  As tornado level winds, there is a water spout, a tornado at sea.
[00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:31.990]  And she sits there for hours watching the town burn.
[00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:40.630]  Hawaii utility faces scrutiny for not shedding power to reduce fire risk.
[00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:46.630]  Washington Post starting to get a picture of where we are.
[00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:53.270]  Now you see a society that's based on high-tech civilization is amazing
[00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:58.550]  unless people running it deliberately weaponize it.
[00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.390]  They've weaponized the border and opened it.
[00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:03.990]  They've weaponized the culture. They've weaponized the public schools.
[00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:07.430]  They've weaponized the agencies against us and the justice department.
[00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.790]  And 900 plus DA's that Soros controls.
[00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.990]  And they're making their move on humanity.
[00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:21.670]  I'm going to come back in a moment after an important announcement in the shower.
[00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:22.870]  I'll be back before the hour ends.
[00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:27.590]  And I'm going to tie this into historical examples of where this has been done.
[00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:31.830]  But the Huns and many others would use fires to knock out their enemies.
[00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:35.350]  Nero wanted to expand his palace and wanted to get rid of the slums.
[00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:37.590]  So he burned 71 percent of Rome.
[00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:42.810]  Fire is a weapon.
[00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.950]  They tell you the world's going to end by 2030 because they're cutting the food off,
[00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.770]  they're cutting the energy off, they're cutting the fertilizer off.
[00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:50.770]  It's already here.
[00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:55.049]  This is the beginning of the administrative state destroying civilization and creating
[00:50:55.049 --> 00:50:59.690]  a post-industrial world for us, except for their high-tech reservations.
[00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:04.330]  Remember, this broadcast is funded by you and powered by your word of mouth.
[00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.009]  That's how we bypass the sensors and the control.
[00:51:07.009 --> 00:51:09.410]  We'll archive this live show later at Band Out Video.
[00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:12.490]  Please share it by a word of mouth, a text message.
[00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:13.490]  Please share clips.
[00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.529]  Please keep doing it.
[00:51:14.529 --> 00:51:18.509]  And please go to Infowarsstore.com and check out the amazing products we've got that
[00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:19.930]  make this broadcast possible.
[00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:24.290]  I'm going to come back and talk more about this and the historical examples of
[00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:28.529]  this and we're going to shift gears into even more incredible information next hour.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:38.299]  They've now confessed to publishing Trump's indictment in Georgia, seven and a half hours
[00:51:38.299 --> 00:51:43.259]  before the grand jury ended its deliberation. They've been caught red handed, but first
[00:51:43.259 --> 00:51:53.700]  this announcement.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:52:02.220]  Introducing Infowars Powerhouse Coffee. Now, 15 years ago, I was here in Austin at a Rutamaya
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:08.819]  coffee shop and drank some really great Chiapas coffee from southern Mexico and thought it
[00:52:08.819 --> 00:52:14.060]  was the best coffee ever. And then with the supply chain breakdowns and the rest of it,
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:18.339]  the quality went down some from the group we were buying it from and the price went
[00:52:18.339 --> 00:52:24.580]  way up. And I said, we don't do that. I am going to suspend coffee sales. It's been
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:30.020]  almost two years. And then about a year ago, I got approached by the wonderful folks
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:33.819]  at Minuteman Coffee that have just exploded in the last few years. They're now becoming
[00:52:33.819 --> 00:52:38.980]  incredibly popular. They got a contract to build their shops on military bases all over
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:43.819]  the United States and the world. They're building them. They've opened shops. The owner is amazing.
[00:52:43.819 --> 00:52:50.020]  It's veteran owned. It is a veteran operated and they have come out with the first of three
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:57.220]  special coffees. And these are not blends. These are single sources from Columbia,
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:03.580]  and they're better than the amazing coffee we were putting out previously. I've been
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:08.980]  approached by, let's not exaggerate, 20 plus companies wanting me to sell coffee.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:15.660]  And it just wasn't as good as what we had before. And so I just said, we're going to hold
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:20.779]  off. The first time about a year ago, they sent me some coffee. I was blown away. Then I
[00:53:20.779 --> 00:53:26.740]  had them send me their whole catalog. They've got like dozens of coffees. And I was like,
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:33.420]  this is incredible. So in the last six months or so, I sampled everything they had. We've
[00:53:34.259 --> 00:53:40.299]  come out with three different coffees and they are, again, amazing. And they fund our operation.
[00:53:40.299 --> 00:53:45.940]  Stop buying staple goods from the big box stores and the globalist. Stop funding your
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.740]  own destruction. I know that's really common sense to say, and you get it and I
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:54.940]  appreciate your support. Instead of $41 billion lost at Anheuser-Busch, which is great,
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:59.779]  it's a new world order, you know, pito supporting company in my view. How about we have
[00:53:59.779 --> 00:54:04.500]  bycots instead of boycotts. And I say boycott to them all day and boycott Disney and Hollywood
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:08.899]  and the rest of it. But more important is supporting and buying from your farmer's
[00:54:08.899 --> 00:54:13.940]  markets and getting a local auto repair shop to fix your car instead of a big chain. We
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:18.660]  really have to support the grassroots. It's been under massive, massive attack in the last few
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:24.779]  years. So I want to challenge everybody who wants to be blown away. This is the best coffee
[00:54:24.779 --> 00:54:33.580]  I've ever tasted. The best coffee I've ever had. And I normally do three or four cups of coffee
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:40.980]  a day. I can only have two of this. It is not just the tastiest coffee I've ever had. It
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:47.580]  is amongst the strongest coffee I have ever drank. And it is really, really good. So this
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:54.339]  is a godsend. We love the folks at Minute Man. These are the first three. One is escape the
[00:54:54.379 --> 00:55:00.859]  prison planet, white roast, the strongest of the three. Then, of course, we've got
[00:55:00.859 --> 00:55:07.020]  medium roast. Wake up America with my ugly mug on the front and then dark roast tip
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:12.140]  of the spear. That is the most delicious in my view of all three. But you want to
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:16.379]  taste this coffee and it's great to wake up in the morning and drink it and think about
[00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:19.980]  the info war and think about what's happening, going on and know that you're supporting
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:24.540]  our reporters and crew and the fights we're involved in. President Trump, with his fourth
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.859]  indictment, said, I will never surrender. And the American people stand with me and
[00:55:28.859 --> 00:55:31.859]  I want to say the same thing. I will never surrender. I know you're never surrendering.
[00:55:31.859 --> 00:55:36.620]  But if you don't support, you might as well just say you surrendered because it
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:43.060]  takes funds to fight this war. Go to info war store dot com. Just search engine coffee
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:46.580]  or we'll put it on the front page or look for the banners in fours dot com. And
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:50.439]  then I would suggest you order all three of these and we're going to have some more
[00:55:50.439 --> 00:55:55.939]  come out as well, including he can source the coffee in Mexico that I love so much
[00:55:55.939 --> 00:56:00.020]  and get it back to the same quality was before, even though quite frankly, that
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:06.620]  coffee's a nine. This is a 10 and I just hope you'll experience it. I hope you'll
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:12.299]  get it. I hope you'll support us. It is, again, single source. Every order gets a
[00:56:12.299 --> 00:56:18.100]  free pocket Constitution citizen rulebook. We're bringing that back for these items as
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:23.700]  well. And again, I already mentioned that it's a veteran owned. This is a very, very
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:28.220]  exciting operation we're launching. And then the funds we get from this are going
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:32.700]  to go to keep info wars on the air. Put our reporters more in the field. Cover the
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:37.460]  border. Bilderberg RNC, DNC, Davos, you name it. So I want to thank you again
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:41.779]  for all your support. I want to encourage you to go now to info war store
[00:56:41.779 --> 00:56:46.859]  dot com and get one, two or all three of this incredible product. And just
[00:56:46.859 --> 00:56:50.980]  longer information is game changing and really creates a political earthquake.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.259]  This stuff is incredible. You're going to drink it and go. Jones didn't lie to
[00:56:55.259 --> 00:57:00.220]  me again. He delivered again. This is a blessing. We got some copies that were
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.580]  OK, some that were pretty good. The deals weren't that good. The prices are
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:07.299]  too high. This tastes great. It's very competitive and it funds the info war.
[00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:11.339]  Get your coffee today at info war store dot com. And I thank you all for your
[00:57:11.339 --> 00:57:17.980]  support. All right. Now available at info war store dot com. I'm out of time.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.620]  I went to that late. I'm going to get into the fires, finish up on that.
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.500]  What I think should be done now to stop these people. And then I'll get
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:27.259]  into the huge developments in Georgia, the huge COVID developments, the huge
[00:57:27.259 --> 00:57:31.180]  Russia developments. It's going to be an insanely powerful, informative hour
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.339]  number two. And then Dr. Ben Marble, one of my favorite people.
[00:57:34.339 --> 00:57:37.939]  What a smart, funny, sweet guy. We're going to cover all these big
[00:57:37.939 --> 00:57:41.899]  developments. Heart attacks at record levels after the pandemic.
[00:57:41.899 --> 00:57:44.740]  London Telegraph. Oh, yeah. We told you that was going to happen.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.899]  These are mass murdering killers. Wake up.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:53.060]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.980]  high quality coffee has not been available. And that's because the
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:59.420]  prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.299]  some. I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us. But
[00:58:03.299 --> 00:58:08.580]  now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:12.819]  national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated. It's
[00:58:12.819 --> 00:58:16.980]  powered by the company Minute Man Coffee. Ladies and gentlemen, this

[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:46.819]  can.
[00:59:48.370 --> 01:00:07.009]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.009 --> 01:00:12.049]  Survivors of the Maui fire say that they received no warning and that the flames appeared so
[01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:15.009]  quickly that escape was difficult.
[01:00:15.009 --> 01:00:20.450]  Everything was suddenly in flames and many found refuge in the ocean for hours while
[01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:26.930]  their homes burned to the ground and into the same powdery ash footprint we've seen in recent
[01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:28.290]  years.
[01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:33.170]  So far, it is estimated that nearly a thousand people have died.
[01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:37.370]  Locals are worried this includes hundreds of children who were home due to school
[01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.890]  being canceled that day.
[01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:44.069]  Several people are reporting that the government is not only doing little to help, but they
[01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:49.670]  are blocking local efforts to do so and are not allowing local donations through and that
[01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:54.350]  they are blocking life saving medicine because it isn't federally approved.
[01:00:54.350 --> 01:01:02.190]  Denying people access to bring in supplies, just supplies for people to live.
[01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:07.190]  The government withholding every single one of our donations because we are not a part
[01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:08.950]  of FEMA and Red Cross.
[01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:12.870]  So none of this is eligible for giving out.
[01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:17.190]  Tell me why I have no frickin clue.
[01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:21.670]  The people of Maui are on their own for now and aside from the federal government's
[01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:26.069]  bureaucratic failure, they have good reason to be suspicious.
[01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:30.630]  Just like what we saw five years ago in Paradise, California, there was nothing
[01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:33.069]  normal about these fires.
[01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:36.790]  Within a day of burning, it was like a bomb went off.
[01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:45.230]  When you see the full extent of the destruction of Lahaina, it will shock you.
[01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:49.470]  It does appear like a bomb and fire went off, if I may.
[01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:52.950]  And all of those buildings virtually are going to have to be rebuilt.
[01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:54.509]  It will be a new Lahaina.
[01:01:54.509 --> 01:01:58.049]  Local residents have been reporting bright flashes of light.
[01:01:58.049 --> 01:02:02.350]  One was captured by a home security camera that appears to have been the start of
[01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:04.790]  the Olinda fire.
[01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.310]  Many people are saying that it was directed energy weapons.
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:11.770]  We know that most major governments already have them.
[01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:17.310]  And during the California fires, online weather maps recorded what looks like a laser from
[01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:22.470]  above, striking an area just before it bursts into flames.
[01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:28.509]  In his research, Dennis Mills discovered that the incendiary aluminum and barium nanodust
[01:02:28.509 --> 01:02:35.790]  from chemtrails is most likely fueling the ferocity of today's so-called super wildfires.
[01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:41.190]  And on the day before the Maui fires broke out, locals were reporting a heavy overcast
[01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:44.589]  from chemtrailing that they'd never seen before.
[01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:49.350]  It's also interesting to note that the Maui police chief was the incident commander
[01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:54.470]  for the Las Vegas mass shooting in 2017.
[01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:58.430]  Lahaina is considered to be a historic and sacred land.
[01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:03.790]  It was the capital of the kingdom of Hawaii before it was taken by the United States.
[01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:08.870]  It's been occupied by native Hawaiians ever since, who are defiantly opposed to
[01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:15.109]  the mainland outsiders who have been buying up land with no respect for local culture.
[01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:21.310]  Not just Black Rock and Vanguard, but billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, who owns more land
[01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:26.350]  on Kauai than what the government of Kauai owns, and Oprah Winfrey, who has bought
[01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:32.190]  over a thousand acres of land in Hawaii, including a new 870 acres in Maui
[01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.630]  she just bought this spring.
[01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:40.830]  In 2018, the Paradise wildfires broke out exactly where the United Nations
[01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:45.029]  have plans to somehow make off limits to humans.
[01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:49.549]  And that same year, a report on wildfire prevention was published
[01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:54.750]  that was focused on the exact same areas in Maui where the fires just broke out.
[01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:59.310]  All the historic downtown, all of it is demolished and all the houses gone.
[01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:02.549]  But those commercial big box stores are still there.
[01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:07.149]  Hawaii Governor Josh Green has been putting the World Economic Forum's
[01:04:07.149 --> 01:04:10.950]  great reset agenda ahead of Hawaiian interests.
[01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:16.190]  Just weeks before the fire, he unveiled an emergency proclamation on housing
[01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:20.710]  that eliminates the traditional land use commission, allowing the government
[01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:27.470]  more leeway to build as they see fit, such as building 15 minute smart cities
[01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:32.870]  run by artificial intelligence, just like they've been planning to do in Hawaii for years.
[01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:38.549]  At some point, I will make a major donation after all of the smoke and ashes
[01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:42.310]  have settled here and we figure out what the rebuilding is going to look like.
[01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:46.549]  This is going to be a long and difficult process.
[01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:50.470]  You're going to see a lot of Phoenix stories rising from the ashes here.
[01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:54.470]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:55.870]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:58.069]  Please spread the word about the broadcast. You are vital.
[01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:03.910]  Coffee has not been available at Infowarsstore.com for two years
[01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:07.029]  because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:11.149]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:13.549]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago
[01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:15.710]  and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:18.670]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best
[01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:21.069]  to offer available to you right now.
[01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:23.230]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:24.750]  It smells amazing.
[01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.109]  And it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:30.149]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source
[01:05:30.149 --> 01:05:34.509]  Colombian coffees are now available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively.
[01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:36.190]  Escape the prison planet.
[01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:37.990]  Light roast tastes great.
[01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:40.149]  It's the strong one. Really strong.
[01:05:40.149 --> 01:05:40.990]  But these are all close.
[01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.710]  Second and third medium roast.
[01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:43.710]  Wake of America.
[01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:46.670]  Whoa. That's what my go to dark roast.
[01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:50.750]  Tip of the spear tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very strong.
[01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:51.710]  Gives you that path.
[01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:55.630]  They're all three available at Infowarsstore.com and they fund our operation.
[01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.830]  And each order gets a pocket Constitution citizen robot.
[01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:15.630]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:18.910]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.390]  All right. I'm going to shift gears.
[01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:24.230]  I spent most of the first hour on the Maui behind the fires.
[01:06:24.509 --> 01:06:27.750]  And now that's definitely an inside job through administrative.
[01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:32.910]  Purposeful, neglect, bare minimum,
[01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:36.549]  and give you some of the other developments and angles historically on this.
[01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:40.069]  Then I'm going to shift gears into
[01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:42.590]  other insanely revealing news.
[01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:46.990]  Let me just give you a little prelude into what we're about to hit.
[01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:50.910]  I told you it's a smoking gun.
[01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:54.270]  That seven and a half hours before the grand jury concluded its liberations
[01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:58.430]  two nights ago and handed down those indictments,
[01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:00.470]  that the exact list of indictments.
[01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:04.430]  Was published.
[01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.790]  On the county website.
[01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.149]  And then they said it was a conspiracy theory, it didn't exist,
[01:07:12.149 --> 01:07:14.390]  and they said somebody hacked it and uploaded that.
[01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:17.230]  That was a lie because reporters pointed out, well,
[01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:21.710]  this is the same indictment cover pages you issued seven and a half hours later.
[01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:26.029]  They now admit they published it.
[01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:30.230]  And they just want to hide it in plain view.
[01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:34.029]  How do you publish the indictment before the grand jury
[01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:36.270]  supposedly wrote it up themselves and handed it down,
[01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.910]  proving it was all being coordinated and orchestrated and choreographed?
[01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:44.430]  I mean, this alone is just, they put a letter out, got it right here.
[01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.230]  Fulton County, I'll show it to you.
[01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:56.230]  But that's like the new special counsel for Hunter Biden.
[01:07:57.549 --> 01:08:02.710]  Who was the prosecutor that whitewashed and was going to give him no jail time.
[01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:06.870]  And then that fell through with the judge because the judge wouldn't be that corrupt.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:36.300]  And so, they appointed the prosecutor that was covering up for Hunter Biden, the crackhead pedophile, Chinese Communist agent. They appointed him to special counsel when there's a federal law that you can't appoint a special counsel that's been involved in any way in the investigation, much less running it and sabotaging.
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:54.300]  But hey, federal laws are for you and I. Rules for thee, not for me. I mean, it's just next level. And it's naked, tyrannical, in your face, doing whatever the hell they want.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.300]  And it's all about blackmail.
[01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:00.670]  The prosecutor?
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:15.880]  Is the girlfriend of a major gang leader that she sees cases over?
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.120]  She's been under criminal investigation by the state.
[01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:30.770]  But now she's going after the super popular president, and they're telling us we can't have him, we can't vote for him.
[01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:40.770]  And the media is in overdrive to try to spin this and fact check it, just like the fact checkers tell you.
[01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:48.770]  Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin don't help you, but now the FDA says, well actually they work great.
[01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:53.770]  And we had studies saying it, so now it's okay.
[01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:58.770]  Because they don't want to have that debate anymore because we've already won in that area.
[01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:06.770]  So, let me talk about how fires use as a weapon, there's so many thousands of examples, I'll just use a few, and how history repeats.
[01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:17.770]  You see, did you know that you're touching electrochemically, just like a power line transfers power, electrons,
[01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:28.770]  electricity, that you are touching your most ancient ancestors.
[01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:34.770]  You're physically touching your grandmother and grandfathers on both sides if you've never met them.
[01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:39.770]  You know, why does that have to do with a fire, I'll explain in a moment, or any of this.
[01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:46.770]  If you've never met your grandparents or great grandparents, they got together, they had sex, a sperm and an egg came together,
[01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:56.770]  had an electrochemical event, they merged their genetics and made a new creature that went on and had a relation with someone else,
[01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:58.770]  and that's your family line.
[01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:08.770]  You are electrochemically a mixture of them, but you also physically touch your parents, like in a relay race where they're running with a baton.
[01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:17.770]  And the first runner goes, they hand off the next runner, but each runner is touching the next runner, and it's an unbroken chain.
[01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:28.770]  So genetically we time travel, our genetic code, our life force goes all the way back to the mist of time.
[01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:42.070]  Well, it's the same thing with customs. Like, no one knows why all over the world, from Africa to Europe to Asia to Latin America...
[01:11:42.090 --> 01:12:01.090]  Every culture dressed a bride in white, and the groom in a darker color. It's just some human custom. We're not sure why. It's just everywhere. Suppose the groups didn't know each other. We do the same thing.
[01:12:01.090 --> 01:12:11.090]  But let's talk about bad customs, because the Bible talks about the tree of good and evil.
[01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:21.090]  And we had good systems, if you believe the Bible. But as an archetype, it's certainly true regardless.
[01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:29.090]  And it wasn't that Adam and Eve were stupid. It's that they didn't have knowledge of evil. They didn't run scams. They were innocent.
[01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:36.090]  But then they got the knowledge of evil. Well, let's talk about a real knowledge of evil that isn't hypothetical, that isn't in contention.
[01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:48.090]  Where do fire departments, the first fire departments come from? Where do we in history learn about the first fire departments?
[01:12:48.090 --> 01:13:00.090]  2,200 years ago, once Rome was getting built up and was bigger, it was a big town, by even today's standards.
[01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:06.090]  As the Roman Empire was in its beginning stoic period...
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:15.920]  ...where they'd execute you if you were homosexual and then a couple hundred years later they were completely out of control.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:24.920]  They said, hey, we've built buildings, we've built things close to each other, we need to create fire clubs, fire brigades...
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:31.920]  ...or a militia of men that will come out and try to put out fires when they start.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:40.920]  And by the time of Julius Caesar, one of the biggest lobbies, and that's what his family made money off of, was fire protection.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:55.920]  And if you didn't pay them the fire protection, their private tax, it was well known they would burn your house down, or your granary down, or your business down.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:25.620]  What's the Italian mafia most known for in the modern world? Pay me insurance, respect me, or somebody's going to burn down your grocery store, or your laundry, or your hotel, or your restaurant.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:35.620]  They're following what their Roman ancestors were doing 2,000 plus years ago. It's a custom.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:46.620]  Well, the Christians were becoming the dominant cult, in the words of the Romans. And Nero was a pagan.
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:15:01.620]  And the Christians were very successful business-wise in the close to a century or so they'd been in place, like anywhere they go.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:07.620]  And Nero wanted to persecute them. He wanted to start killing them.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:17.620]  He also wanted to tear down a bunch of stuff and build a new palace and some new racetracks and gaming facilities for the gladiators.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:31.620]  And so most historians agree the evidence is Nero definitely had firefighters stand down and was probably behind the fire because he said let it burn on record.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:54.620]  And he burned down not just the Christians that were about 20% of Rome, he burned down 70 plus percent of Rome over six days and played his fiddle while it happened and had the fire brigades protect his complex.
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:16:16.620]  So when the media calls me a conspiracy theorist for saying they turned off the water, they turned off the emergency sirens, they left the power on, that's all confirmed, and they knew that it would fall into the brush, they left the trees growing, they let it grow up over the last few years, knowing it would burn Lahaina to the ground, the second most expensive real estate in the world.
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:24.620]  Well good, call me a conspiracy theorist. Have your fact-checkers say it's not true. Tell us cybermectin's no good again too. Tell us two men can have a baby.
[01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:33.630]  No one's buying. People are pissed and they see right through it. But there are historical
[01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:41.790]  examples of this going on throughout history over and over and over again. And they later
[01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:48.330]  killed Nero. They said he committed suicide, kind of like Stalin or Lenin. Because people
[01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:55.530]  were pissed man. It got out of control. It burned most of Rome to the ground. Took them
[01:16:55.530 --> 01:17:05.530]  a hundred years to build back to where they were. Nero never got to see his big dreams.
[01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:07.610]  The night of 18th of July.
[01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:37.810]  1964 A.D. became legend. Rome burns and the fire fanned by a strong wind is not extinguished. The city burns for nine days. In six days much of the town was destroyed. The Circus Maximus was decimated and dedicated to chariot racing and was the most significant
[01:17:37.810 --> 01:18:07.810]  supporting enclosure in the Roman world. Due to the wind the great city is engulfed in flames along its entire length. Undoubtedly the fire was fueled by goods stored in the immediate vicinity. The great fire of Rome was Emperor Nero behind it. Rome was burning Nero in the fire that ended the dynasty. So they don't want you to debate how they administratively stood down.
[01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:31.810]  But it is a tool of governments going back thousands of years. And that my friends is the rest of the story. July 18th, 64. Not even 100 years after the death of Christ.
[01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:53.810]  But don't worry Joe Biden is sending $70 to each person. That comes out to a couple million dollars. $700. How much did I say? $700. Biden slammed for offering insulting 700 payments to Maui wildfire victims.
[01:18:54.810 --> 01:19:11.810]  And here's a nice graphic. Hawaii gets $12 billion. Ukraine gets $170 billion. Hawaiian governor says state looking to acquire land that was destroyed.
[01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:29.810]  And it goes on and on and on and on. And Joe Biden won't even comment on it. Steve Bannon said there are a thousand dead in Maui. How could this possibly be caused simply by wildfire devastation? Looks like Tokyo or Dresden after fire bombings.
[01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:55.810]  And they've caught arsonists before setting fires. Leftist always. But this is not trimming the trees, letting them grow up and build up and leaving the power on, cutting the water off, turning off the emergency sirens and now kicking the media out so no one can investigate what happened.
[01:19:56.810 --> 01:20:08.810]  All right. The Chinese central bank is on the verge of collapse. People say, well, great collapse then. Well, it'll collapse us as well. We're going to be looking at all of that today.
[01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:18.810]  We're going to be looking at mainstream media and governments admitting record heart attacks and blood clots that are just the worst in the history.
[01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:32.810]  And they're saying it's COVID, but it's the COVID vaccinated mainly. Isn't that interesting? We're going to be talking about all of it today.
[01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:40.810]  They've also got fact checkers out trying to say that it wasn't because the power was left on. But your precious Washington Post admits they left the power on.
[01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:48.810]  Hawaii utilities face scrutiny for not shutting power to reduce fire risk.
[01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:53.810]  Now let's talk about COVID.
[01:20:54.170 --> 01:21:03.170]  The big enchilada.
[01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:10.170]  Let's talk about the elephant in the room.
[01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:12.170]  No.
[01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:17.170]  I'm not talking about what I'm going to hit after the break in eight minutes.
[01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:23.170]  I'm talking about depopulation.
[01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:31.170]  Now, I can show you numbers and give you actuaries and have Lord Monckton on and all the rest of it.
[01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:38.170]  And look at all the other deindustrialization, the shutdown of the power grid and the infrastructure and the fertilizer and the rest of it.
[01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:49.170]  But why not hear from the founder of Greenpeace, a respected scientist, Dr. Patrick Moore,
[01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:54.170]  who says he got involved in environmentalism to actually save species and stabilize the planet.
[01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:57.170]  The policies of the globalists are actually destroying the planet.
[01:21:57.170 --> 01:22:05.170]  And they tell us this destruction is caused by us while the globalists are actually running the policies that destroy it.
[01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:11.170]  If we actually achieve net zero, at least 50% of the population of the world would die of hunger and disease.
[01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:19.170]  And, boy, that will cause some massive wars because at least 50% of the population depends on nitrogen fertilizer for existence.
[01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:26.170]  Now, I've harped on this, but they've already cut it around 25% the last two years.
[01:22:26.170 --> 01:22:32.170]  And so that's like sending a scuba diver down with half the oxygen they need for how long the dive is.
[01:22:32.170 --> 01:22:35.170]  They're going to be down there, and if they don't come up early, they're going to die.
[01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:40.170]  This is very simple math, and it's administrative.
[01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:44.170]  Food doesn't just arrive in the grocery stores. Electricity doesn't just arrive in your electric socket.
[01:22:44.170 --> 01:22:51.170]  It took hundreds of years of infrastructure and training and dedicated people to build this.
[01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:59.170]  And now the globalists have decided to pull the rug out from under everything, and that's Agenda 2030.
[01:22:59.170 --> 01:23:03.170]  And that's why Prince Charles and Sadiq Khan have the countdown clock saying,
[01:23:03.170 --> 01:23:09.170]  The world is going to end in seven years, as we know it, unless you let us follow these policies.
[01:23:09.170 --> 01:23:13.170]  Here is John Kerry, the king said to tell you.
[01:23:13.170 --> 01:23:18.170]  John Kerry, the first thing we've got to do is cut food off or there'll be starvation.
[01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:21.170]  I played the clips, and you're like, that doesn't make sense.
[01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:25.170]  Yeah, like two men having a baby, or two women had a baby in prison.
[01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:30.170]  Because they've triggered the countdown to the collapse.
[01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:36.170]  And no, we're not the hottest we've ever been, and no hurricanes are actually weak right now.
[01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:39.170]  But they do have weather weapons, and there's no telling what they're going to pull.
[01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:43.170]  And then say it's our fault that we didn't submit to them properly.
[01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:47.170]  They want to block out the sun. People thought it was a joke when I told you decades ago.
[01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:50.170]  Now it's proposed. Biden says they're going to try to do it.
[01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:53.170]  They're playing God.
[01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:57.170]  But Biden can't even wipe his own ass, literally.
[01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:11.170]  So, here's the clip of the founder of Greenpeace laying out that the first major dominoes have already fallen.
[01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:18.170]  And when the third world's devastated and half of them die, the UN's going to organize the rest to march on us.
[01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:22.170]  And the globalists are going to manage that crisis into total control.
[01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:29.170]  And if we don't accept the smart cards and the robot control and the social credit scores, they'll just keep flooding us.
[01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:32.170]  And you notice the speeches of Kerry and Schwab.
[01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:36.170]  Schwab's, if we do not have a UN world government.
[01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:40.170]  I'm not trying to do Schwab any more like a Russian accent.
[01:24:40.170 --> 01:24:44.170]  I'm not trying a German accent any more like a Dr. Strange level, but I'll do it.
[01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:47.170]  It's better than nothing.
[01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:52.170]  If you think 50 million migrants is a problem, imagine billions.
[01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:57.170]  You must follow our directives immediately. We are in an angry world. Yes.
[01:24:57.170 --> 01:25:01.170]  And they're administratively doing all this because they're in control.
[01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:07.170]  The UN's going to control the medical systems, the energy, the borders, the communications, the censorship.
[01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:10.170]  It's all being announced, run by the UN, run by the UN.
[01:25:10.170 --> 01:25:14.170]  They're not coming with green helmets or blue helmets.
[01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:16.170]  They're not going to cut the brush down around the power lines.
[01:25:16.170 --> 01:25:18.170]  They're going to cut the power off the power lines.
[01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:20.170]  When they don't, they're going to burn you down.
[01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:23.170]  They're going to chop your children's pee-pee off.
[01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:25.170]  They're going to ship fentanyl in.
[01:25:25.170 --> 01:25:27.170]  They're going to launch wars.
[01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:34.330]  This is the administrative, high-tech state at war with you.
[01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:39.330]  Use a dumbed-down analogy of Stephen King in maximum overdrive.
[01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:42.330]  Or Christine, if that's the one he wrote.
[01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:45.330]  Where the machines all go crazy and start killing us.
[01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:56.670]  They could administratively make your transformers blow up and fall down by running too much
[01:25:56.670 --> 01:25:57.670]  use into them.
[01:25:57.670 --> 01:26:04.070]  That's just an analogy of what they can do and you just saw it in Maui, in Lahaina, Lahaina.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.639]  Play the club.
[01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:13.840]  If we actually achieve net zero at least 50% of the population would die of hunger and
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:21.559]  disease and no doubt about it because just one thing which is nitrogen based fertilizer
[01:26:21.559 --> 01:26:28.000]  at least 50% of the population depends on nitrogen fertilizer for its existence to date.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.840]  There's no doubt about that and there's people trying to ban it and Netherlands
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:40.599]  and Sri Lanka have already made these kind of moves and so it is truly a death wish in
[01:26:40.599 --> 01:26:53.440]  disguise and the disguise is to save the earth which doesn't need saving particularly.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:27:02.280]  Ireland, before all these other countries cut their nitrogen in farming, Sri Lanka six years
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:08.679]  ago signed on to the UN as the model. Wealthy, successful, beautiful, tourism great. Now
[01:27:08.679 --> 01:27:17.740]  giant riots burned down, starvation annihilated. Just type in Sri Lankan riots of last year,
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:24.940]  a 20-20 tear. And now all the headlines, World Economic Forum, we must eat some bugs. This
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:31.380]  is how rice is hurting the planet. Rice is bad now, see? Well if cows are bad and rice
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:38.700]  is bad and who else is bad? Us, we have methane and carbon dioxide coming out of us
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:44.860]  and we've let them define us as a disease and say we're warming the planet? Total crap.
[01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:49.750]  So.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:58.400]  Show Sri Lankan Storm the Government Palace, can we show that?
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:08.480]  So this is where we are. And he says angry a world is angry a world. It's a very angry world.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:17.480]  When it gets in your skin, we change you, not the world. Soon there'll be no more poverty because you'll be dead.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:26.240]  And I just sit here and I watch the sun fold while they turn off the power grid and turn
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:31.280]  off the infrastructure. And do you think the masses know while this is happening? No, they
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.640]  don't know. Let's see, we'll offer them universal basic income and 200 square foot
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.520]  apartment and bogs. Ah yes, the old society because of global warming collapsed. So he
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:48.640]  offers them the new society. They are collapsing the society, everything in front of you. It's
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:56.200]  not coming. It's here. Listen to me or be destroyed. Period. This is not a movie. It's
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:01.800]  not a Netflix episode. Coffee has not been available at info war store.com for two

[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:12.520]  with Project Veritas whistleblowers and now two books with Alex Jones. That's because I use
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:18.440]  brainforce every day. What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:23.960]  and so you know I try to exercise eat well take good vitamins but the one thing that I have
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:29.800]  really found that makes a difference is brainforce I'll take brainforce in the morning
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:35.120]  right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:40.720]  lot of stuff so it really is true that brainforce is something I use every day and it helps me
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.920]  with my writing all right we love you we'll be right back get your brainforce plus brainforce

[01:32:49.280 --> 01:33:05.760]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:25.740]  Now the puppet governor of Arizona wants Trump indicted. The rats are piling on. If
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:32.860]  you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from the Infowars.com
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:39.019]  studios. It's Alex Jones. Senator Josh Hawley said it best. They're sending a message to everybody.
[01:33:39.019 --> 01:33:44.860]  This is a dictatorship. He sent a message loud and clear. The message is don't mess with us.
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.380]  And why are they going after Trump? Because he messed with them. He challenged them across
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:53.019]  the board. He challenged their pro-war policies. He challenged them on Ukraine. He's challenged
[01:33:53.019 --> 01:33:57.260]  their globalist agenda. That's ripped off our working class for years, hollowed out the
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:03.179]  industrial base of this country and made our workers in this country slaves compared to China
[01:34:03.179 --> 01:34:06.940]  and these other nations that have taken away our jobs, taken away our technology. Trump
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:11.340]  challenged all of that. And the message is if you challenge them on this stuff, if you challenge
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.460]  them on these policies they hold dear, they will come after you. If you challenge them on
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:21.980]  their pro-abortion religion, they will come after you. So I think the message is real clear.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:25.900]  Don't challenge us. Don't go to work for anybody who will challenge us. Don't vote for
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:31.179]  Donald Trump or anybody like him or we'll treat you as a domestic terrorist. And I tell you what,
[01:34:31.179 --> 01:34:36.059]  Laura, this is a recipe for one party rule in this country. And if that's the case,
[01:34:36.059 --> 01:34:41.179]  this isn't the United States of America anymore. Our constitutional democracy doesn't exist anymore.
[01:34:41.179 --> 01:34:44.219]  We've also got some breaking news right now. So we want to check in with CBS's Mark
[01:34:44.219 --> 01:34:49.660]  Strassman. He is in Georgia where they're having a big problem counting some of the votes.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:49.980]  Mark.
[01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:57.820]  Nora, this is an election return watch party here on the edge of Atlanta. These are mostly
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:02.300]  excited Democrats because once the last time Georgia thought of itself as a battleground state.
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:07.740]  After a record early returns and essentially a day of problem-free voting, there is now a
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:13.099]  hitch in the tabulation of votes. I'm standing in Fulton County. Fulton County includes a chunk
[01:35:13.099 --> 01:35:17.420]  of Atlanta. Downtown Atlanta is State Farm Arena where the Atlanta Hawks play. They are
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:23.099]  tabulating the absentee ballots of Fulton County, Georgia's most populous County. A water pipe has
[01:35:23.099 --> 01:35:28.940]  broken inside the arena. They had counted 86,000 absentee ballots. We don't know how many more they
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.420]  have yet to tabulate, but all the tabulation of those ballots has now stopped. We're told by
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:40.219]  election officials, they may not finish tabulating those votes for a day or two. So depending how
[01:35:40.219 --> 01:35:46.380]  close the rest of this state is, we may not know the result of this critical battleground state
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:51.420]  for another day or two. That is because, again, a water pipe has broken in State Farm Arena.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:55.099]  State Farm Arena is where they were counting the absentee ballots of Georgia's most populous
[01:35:55.099 --> 01:36:00.700]  county and now the tabulation has stopped. Big development here. But Mark, do you know how
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:06.300]  many how many ballots we're talking about? What that means? We don't know. We've asked that
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:10.940]  question, Gail, and we haven't got an answer for that yet. We know that there were 86,000, but
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:15.580]  apparently it's a very labor-intensive process and what they are telling us is that it's going
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:19.500]  to take a day or two, which suggests to me that they have a lot to go.
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:25.340]  And Trump in the indictment I showed you yesterday in Georgia is being indicted. They
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:31.179]  say it's a fraud that no one shut it down. No one kicked people out, but they did. And
[01:36:31.179 --> 01:36:35.260]  they kept counting. And that's on the surveillance footage. And now Governor Katie
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:41.260]  Hobbs calls for Trump to be indicted as they pile on. They're trying to make it illegal
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:45.660]  to challenge them. Of course, the pipe never broke. They lied.
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:37:02.040]  Just like the same group just got caught publishing the indictment index. Then they said it wasn't true. Then they said it was a hack. Then they said it was fake. Now they said it's real.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:12.040]  And nothing to worry about. We'll show you that in a moment. But I'm going to play the Senator Josh Hawley clip one more time. Because where have you heard this before?
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:20.040]  That they're setting up a dictatorship. They're coming after all of us. They're declaring us all domestic terrorists. And they're setting up a one-party state.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:36.040]  I've been like a psychotic parrot saying that because that's historically what this is. And the good news is, whether it's Rand Paul or Senator Hawley or all these other leaders in the EU, people now get what this is.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:45.040]  I know it's hard to believe and it's terrible and we don't want this to happen and I'm targeted by them. I wish this wasn't true. They let me know you shut down and stop and we're going to put your ass in prison.
[01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:53.769]  But, I mean, we're all being put into prison. These people are burning us out. They're destroying
[01:37:53.769 --> 01:37:59.330]  our borders. I can't, as a man, look myself in the mirror.
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:10.060]  And think about my ancestors and do this. My ancestors were amazing. I don't live off
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:14.460]  my ancestors. It's interesting to know about your ancestors. I do know about my ancestors.
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:19.620]  And they were illustrious. Both sides of the family going back over and over again, always
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:25.020]  there promoting freedom, always kicking ass, always dominating tyrants, always trailblazing.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:39.300]  I can look them in the eye. I've lived up, at least in measure, to the basic thing I need to do to be
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:47.580]  part of my lineage, to be part of my family. And I look at these scumbags and all the things
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:51.580]  they're doing, and I just thank my lucky stars every day I don't come from trash like them.
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:39:03.420]  Garbage. Traders. We'll beat these people 100%. The question is, how bad is it going to get? Every
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:08.100]  time they indict Trump, his numbers go up. But they don't care. So their answer is more,
[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:13.060]  more, more. They don't know how to quit. They don't know how to stop. But look at
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:20.140]  Maui. I mean, I'd say 99% of the comments out there everywhere on mainline sites are,
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:24.300]  you bastards, we know you did it. And it turns out they did. They administratively let it all
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.860]  grow up, get around it, let the power on, turned off the sirens, turned off the water.
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:32.500]  They're kicking everybody out to cover it up now. They wanted that land, second most expensive
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:32.980]  land in the world.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:37.400]  And people get it?
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:42.400]  See, once you get it, once you take the red pill, what does Morpheus say to Neo?
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:50.400]  He goes, you can't be told about the Matrix, Mr. Anderson.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:56.400]  You need to just take this red pill and you're going to go down a rabbit hole.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:02.400]  You want to do that? Or you want to take the blue pill and go back to Wonderland?
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.400]  Go back to Fantasyland.
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:12.460]  Submission to these people is only going to make things worse.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:22.460]  And there is a satisfaction, not a pride, but a satisfaction.
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:32.220]  That is the most deeply satisfying thing on earth to stand up for our species and to be a man and to not be a coward.
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:45.220]  And the drug of being a good person and knowing you're in alignment with God, I'm not some saint, I'm not perfect, but I'm not a coward and God hates cowards, is the greatest thing on earth.
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:54.220]  And I wish our enemies could taste of honor and will and duty and commitment.
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:41:01.220]  There are wonderful black people, there are horrible black people, there are wonderful white people, there are terrible white people.
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:07.220]  There are great Germans, there are bad Germans, there are great Jews, there are bad Jews, there are great Chinese, there are bad Chinese.
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:09.220]  There's great Mexicans, there's bad Mexicans.
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:14.220]  But everybody knows how it is in a city or a town.
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:24.220]  Don't do business with those people, don't get around those people, whatever group they are, not because of what race they are, but because of what family they come from.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:28.220]  Every once in a while a bad family, you get a good person.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:32.220]  But most of the time you just get bad people out of a bad family.
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:36.220]  And we get good out of good families.
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:38.220]  And we come in every race, color, and creed.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:43.220]  And it's time for good people to realize the adventure awaits.
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:51.220]  It's an adventure, it's not a video game, it's not Grand Theft Auto, it's not a game of paintball, I'm not knocking people to play paintball.
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:53.220]  That's all fun, it's good exercise.
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:42:02.220]  But watching a football game or playing pool, at the end of the day, is not what you're designed to do.
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:09.220]  Those are extracurricular activities when the children are taken care of, and the crops are in, and the realm is secure.
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:14.220]  And then, you go and have some fun.
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:23.220]  But you don't have some fun while the whole civilization is burning down around you, literally and figuratively.
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.220]  When we return...
[01:42:25.450 --> 01:42:32.450]  They now admit they published the indictment seven and a half hours before the grand jury
[01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:40.130]  came back with their judgment. That's like a jury, it is a jury, in a criminal case before
[01:42:40.849 --> 01:42:46.490]  they've deliberated and completed and handed down their verdict. Seven and a half hours
[01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:53.010]  before they published a guilty verdict in the county clerk's office. It proves they
[01:42:53.010 --> 01:43:00.010]  are what we already knew they were. Total criminals. We'll be right back.

[01:45:02.010 --> 01:45:07.010]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:14.010]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker
[01:45:14.010 --> 01:45:20.010]  that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price than you'll find in stores.
[01:45:20.010 --> 01:45:24.010]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:45:24.010 --> 01:45:32.010]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier,
[01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:37.010]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:39.010]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:45:39.010 --> 01:45:49.010]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD exclusively at infowarsstore.com right now.

[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:06.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:20.280]  All right, I want to get into the latest in Georgia that is huge, beyond huge, but first
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:28.320]  I noticed about a week ago, I read news articles how they opened up the beaches in Ukraine,
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.560]  in the areas Ukraine holds, the Russians weren't bothering them for them to party.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:36.120]  That was in the news.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:43.520]  And then when the footage came out of the people partying, the fact checkers on Google and
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:48.680]  everywhere else said, no, no, no, that's Israel or that's somewhere else, no one's partying,
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:55.080]  no one's at the beaches, Ukraine needs billions more, 12 billion more this week.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:58.160]  But then it was all confirmed that it was Ukraine.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.200]  In fact, you don't know something's real until an official fact checker says it isn't.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:15.440]  So Zelensky came out yesterday, and I've got the video right here, we'll play it in a moment.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:18.520]  He's speaking Russian, that's what Ukrainian is.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:25.560]  And he says, do not party, we do not party while we're at war, there are no parties,
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.600]  don't stop partying.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:42.120]  But you can pull up the articles that last week, Ukraine opened its Black Sea beaches,
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.400]  the area they control, they control about half of it.
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:48.480]  The Russians aren't targeting civilian targets, there it is, Reuters, Ukraine Odessa opens
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.960]  a few beaches for the first time since Russian invasion, August 12th.
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:59.100]  But then the fact checkers, you can pull it up, came out and said, no, no, there's no
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:05.060]  beaches open, Ukraine is a death camp, Putin's murdering everyone.
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:18.160]  But still they party, the image doesn't work, so Zelensky comes out
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:24.840]  and says, we're at war, quote, the ones fighting at the front should help those who do to fight,
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.440]  not sitting in bars or clubs or raving in the streets.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:36.440]  It looks like those viral videos of Ukrainian pool parties are having an impact.
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.840]  Let's play a clip of Zelensky for the fact checkers.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.840]  Here it is.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:50:04.560]  Now, if he was an honest person, he'd say, we're in a hard war.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.560]  Our people have been through a lot.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:08.940]  They deserve R&R.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:13.660]  Thank God we've secured most of Ukraine so you can party, but they said, we do not party.
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:15.460]  Stop your partying right now.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.460]  It is evil.
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:18.120]  It is bad.
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:21.860]  So the beach is open, Reuters party.
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:25.060]  That's not, that's not Ukraine.
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:31.720]  Hey, hundreds of whales just washed up by the windmills off the East coast.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:40.720]  The marine biologist and the mammal experts on these whales, they say it's the windmills.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.280]  No, no, Facebook bans it.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:50.080]  It doesn't matter what it is they're forcing lies on you.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:53.480]  There is no one partying, says Facebook, says Twitter.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.760]  They were taking something down on Twitter.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:57.760]  Okay.
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:58.760]  They are partying.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:00.520]  Stop the partying right now.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.720]  I told you, you do not party during war.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:04.720]  We are in hell.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:09.320]  I always shoot videos in bunker.
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:10.320]  Everything is hell.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.720]  Putin kill all of us.
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:12.720]  Help me.
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:13.720]  Help me now.
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:14.720]  Please.
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:15.720]  Give me more money.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.680]  Oh look, Tom Cruise came.
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:19.480]  He make me look tall.
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:22.000]  Look, I went Tom Cruise now.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.120]  Oh look, I am also with, what's his name?
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:29.520]  This real stupid guy, Sean Penn, say we need nuclear war.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:30.520]  Yes.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:31.520]  Nuke war good.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.520]  We not party a bit.
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.520]  Nuke war.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.520]  Nuke war.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:35.520]  Nuke war.
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.520]  Nuke war.
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:37.520]  Nuke war.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.520]  Nuke war.
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:39.520]  Look, I'm in an underground bunker with flashing lights.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.520]  The power is out.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:44.520]  The Russians are killing me right now.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:47.520]  Okay.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:53.840]  Now, again, going back two days ago, since like a hundred years ago.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:00.400]  They published the indictment index, which was the index of the indictment. They even
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:06.520]  changed it. They're too lazy. Seven and a half hours. Oh, they're finally deliberating. They're
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:10.520]  deciding right now. They've been deliberating since noon. Oh, wait, it's on the website.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:16.520]  He's guilty. They've indicted 18 people and they're like, oh no, that's not real.
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:24.040]  That, that, that, that. We got hacked. Yes. Okay. It is real. It's no big deal. We were
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:33.960]  just wargaming things and it just so happens to match the indictment perfectly. It's just
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  a mishap. Zelensky, do not party unless it's on high heels and leather with men.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:48.040]  Oh, I love men so much like Obama. Oh, best time with him. Oh, big wee wee. Oh, so nice.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:55.760]  We have hot dog parties together. So nice. Oh, good for me. Oh, Obama baby. Oh, oh yeah.
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:03.960]  Oh, you're so nice Obama. You like my black pumps? You like to sit with me? Oh
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:10.960]  baby. Oh, baby. So they want sell outs. They want scumbags and nothing against sex
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:18.840]  operatives like Zelensky or Obama. The fact that they're male sex operatives of the CIA,
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:24.100]  you know, whatever. The point is, is that these are puppets and they'll do whatever
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:29.280]  they're told they'll to do because they have no honor. But I'm not like the mainstream
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:35.560]  media that just tells you that Fulton County, Georgia put out a report. Here it is. Office
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:42.560]  of the Fulton County Clerk of Superior and Magistrate Courts, Honorable Shay Alexander,
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:49.280]  Fulton County Clerk Courts. And they say it was a mishap. It was just a drill. That
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:56.280]  was not the indictment. We didn't have it. No, no, no, no, no. It was lucky. That's
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:54:03.520]  why in mass year, everything good. Oh yeah. Good hot dog too. Oh yeah, baby. Awesome.
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.860]  Nice. Good for you. Meanwhile, they're murdering people in mass. They dig up mass graves
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:17.440]  of babies with their organs cut out by the Ukrainians. They have Nazi swastikas
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:23.440]  or Heilig Hitler. And the New York Times says, well, it's okay some Nazi, some Nazi
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:29.440]  goo like old George Soros.
[01:54:29.610 --> 01:54:36.809]  Are you ashamed working for Hitler, a 60-minute task? No, actually not. It was the best time
[01:54:36.809 --> 01:54:44.690]  of my life. I was happy making. It was quite exhilarating. It's like markets. If I didn't
[01:54:44.690 --> 01:54:55.290]  do it, somebody else would. So liberal. And then we've got this. Now Governor Katie Hobbs
[01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:59.009]  calls for Trump to be indicted for trying to overturn the election in Arizona. She
[01:54:59.049 --> 01:55:06.809]  says, more indictments? How dare you challenge me? But she ran the elections in her own election.
[01:55:06.809 --> 01:55:14.690]  All right. Dr. Ben Marble is scheduled to be in studio with us. And boy, do we have a lot
[01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:22.290]  of news on those shots that our good loving friends have been giving us. Why would they
[01:55:22.290 --> 01:55:25.730]  be so bold and give us poison shots that cause 20 million to die and all the heart
[01:55:25.730 --> 01:55:29.130]  attacks and everything? Because they've corrupted the medical system and the media now that's
[01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:38.089]  a party to it. And they're getting everybody ready for more fun. They're criminals. We've
[01:55:38.089 --> 01:55:46.490]  laid down to them. They can't help but make a run at us. And talk about failure
[01:55:46.490 --> 01:55:52.730]  and civilization. Look at this article on Infowars.com. Stay home, says the quote. Feds
[01:55:52.730 --> 01:55:58.210]  tell San Francisco workers to telecommute due to crime wave. Yeah, don't go out the streets.
[01:55:58.210 --> 01:56:03.290]  You got, oh, first it was COVID. Now the crime's so bad or the heat's so bad. All
[01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:12.170]  psyops. That's right. Stay at home. Fulfilled civilization. Now there's no security. Now
[01:56:12.170 --> 01:56:18.250]  there's no food. Cut off the energy. Cut off the fertilizer. We're going to go to break,
[01:56:18.250 --> 01:56:22.650]  come back with Dr. Ben Marble. But we're going to keep fighting. Our message is so critical

[02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:05.260]  for the United States government. A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:11.100]  of the army. Here is a bulletin from CBS news. President Kennedy has been shot. This
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:17.780]  is a different kind of war. The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and
[02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:22.460]  computer birds. The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States. They took
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:26.380]  the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor. It was
[02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:36.900]  almost as if it were a plan. You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:42.700]  but distractions. You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. Silence those voices. What
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:48.340]  we want to do in Davos is push the reset button. As soon as we start exposing the
[02:00:48.340 --> 02:01:01.260]  great reset. All you have to do is check out what I'm saying. And that's why they run the
[02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:07.700]  fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere. Every day, Jones admits
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:13.780]  he's an actor or Tucker Carlson says, nobody would take me seriously. Where did we say that?
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:19.900]  We never said that. They just say, we said that. But where's the clip? Where's the
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:25.940]  article? Where do we say that? Doesn't exist. Alex Jones is playing a character and is a
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:32.300]  performance artist. Jones is playing a character on his radio show. The radio rants of Alex
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:39.300]  Jones are just an act. He's actually a performance artist. He's a performance artist. Alex Jones
[02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:45.820]  is a fake. They're lying to you because they think you're stupid. And it's all based on
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:50.900]  the custody battle of my ex-wife five years ago. And she was trying to put into evidence
[02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:55.740]  me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic saying, take
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:02:01.180]  your Prozac kids, take your illegal drugs too. You'll die. It's fun. So people wouldn't
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:05.500]  take drugs and they wanted to enter that in evidence. They look, he's insane telling
[02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:11.540]  kids to use drugs. And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker,
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:17.540]  no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson. So yeah, when I've been Cobra commander,
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:22.420]  or Optimus Prime, Autobots, let's roll, or the Joker, cause I can do imitations of
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:28.460]  them all really good. Or Darth Vader. Don't act so surprised globalist. You didn't think
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:34.380]  you could silence the American people, did you? Do I really think I'm Darth Vader? No.
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:40.860]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra commander, the Joker? No. And clearly no reasonable person
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:46.060]  would think when I'm doing satire, that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:50.700]  No one believes the Babylon bee. It's not trying to lie to you. It's being sarcastic
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:55.180]  by the vaccinate me Elmo doll today. It's required by the CDC, but they play
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:59.940]  those games. And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to, even though
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:05.540]  I tell people, okay, this is a joke. This isn't serious. They clip it out and they say, no,
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:10.660]  this is what he really believes. Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:14.500]  That man's a threat to this country. And they go, look, he admitted in court. He's an actor.
[02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:18.980]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in scanner darkly. I was an actor in waking life.
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:26.980]  I was an actor when I was Cobra commander, but it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:32.260]  host up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing. And isn't something I'm actually
[02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:36.580]  saying. And you know, that you're insulted right now. I'm even explaining that to you.
[02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:44.740]  And so am I, but that's who these people are. You don't know the power of the dark side.
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:51.300]  Am I really Darth Vader? I think Alex Jones seems really talented. He's smart.
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:55.140]  He's funny as hell. It's truly funny. I'm kind of retarded.
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:04:05.540]  Now that I've done those imitations,
[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:11.060]  those little jokes, you now not listen to what I say about other things when I
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:15.860]  show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on info wars.com.
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:20.900]  It has all the cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome.
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.620]  No, that's a real thing. That's something happening in the real world.
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:32.260]  And that's what we're breaking down here today. I am Alex Jones and I am the guy on the show
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:37.540]  every day. I am an American and that's what I promote is freedom and justice and
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:40.660]  liberty and they can't stand it.
[02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:54.660]  Pesky earth creatures.
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:03.620]  Coffee has not been available at info war store.com for two years because the price
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:08.900]  went up too high and the quality was starting to go down. I turned out so many other producers
[02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:12.500]  that wanted to partner with us, but when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:17.140]  I began to try their coffees, I was blown away. We finally have three great coffees that
[02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:21.380]  are the best they have to offer available to you right now. This is the best coffee I've
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:26.100]  ever tasted. It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:31.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:36.900]  at info war store.com exclusively escape the prison planet. Light roast tastes great.
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:40.900]  It's the strong one. Really strong, but these are all close. Second and thirds
[02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:46.500]  medium roast wake up America. That's what my go-to dark roast. Tip of the spear tastes the
[02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:51.380]  best and is amazing and it's still very, very strong. Gives you that path. They're all three
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:56.260]  available at info war store.com and they fund our operation and each order gets a pocket
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:05:57.300]  constitution citizen.
[02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:51.300]  You see your life, but if you want to find help me, I'm going to show you what it is.
[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:59.540]  Humanity is rising. Humanity will not give up on our destiny and our forebears and everything
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:06.020]  they did to take us to this point. This is not humanity's weakest hour. This is not
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:10.340]  our darkest hour. This will be our greatest hour.
[02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:49.540]  I got ABC news. I got CBS news. I got the Washington post. They can't stand to report
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:54.420]  it, but they're forced to do it. We didn't do a victory lap a week ago, but I wanted
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:59.700]  Dr. Ben marble here to talk about this. And he's here with us now at the forefront
[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:05.220]  under attack being deep bank, being demonized in the media and going through hell for
[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:12.900]  prescribing ivermectin in the heart of the COVID crisis and saving so many lives.
[02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:19.140]  He is here with us in studio. Doctors can now prescribe ivermectin for COVID-19 FDA
[02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:26.100]  lawyer admits and they come out Epic times reports as well that they have all the studies
[02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:34.500]  that we already had that it works. So think about that. And that's a big victory.
[02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:38.980]  These criminals are amazing. How they administratively kill people by not cutting
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:42.420]  the trees around the power lines. When the big wind comes leaving the power on,
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:46.660]  turn the sirens off, turn the water off and sitting back while that $5 billion of
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:51.460]  property burns to the ground and the big bankers lick their filthy lips.
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:57.140]  Court talk about this first and then pilot of commercial airline carrying 271 passengers dies
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:09:03.300]  following cardiac arrest mid-flight. You say, well, that's anecdotal. This isn't the
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:12.100]  London Telegraph heart attacks at record level after pandemic fraud doctor on Ohio
[02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:18.260]  medical board. The fraudster medical doctor that discredited hydroxychloroquine with a fake study
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:26.180]  is having his license pulled. And it just goes on from there. We've got so much COVID
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:31.940]  victims families sue EcoHealth Alliance for funding releasing the virus. Criminal charges
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:37.540]  referred on Fauci by the Senate. Italian researchers find COVID vaccine myocarditis
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:44.020]  relapses of teenage boys following apparently complete initial recovery. It goes on and on.
[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:50.420]  Dr. Ben Marble here in studio with us of myfreedoctor.com. There are a lot of great
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:54.580]  telemedicine groups that Trump legalized five years ago out there, but this guy did it
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:59.060]  for free donations only and served hundreds of thousands and went through hell to do it.
[02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:02.660]  Dr. Ben, great to have you here with us. Great to be back on the show, Alex.
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:09.140]  Thanks for having me. Wow. So let's go ahead and talk about the ivermectin saga first. This just
[02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:13.940]  ain't horse paste. We just go ahead and need to go ahead and declare victory on this. We have
[02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:20.980]  won this. We knew ivermectin worked. I knew Dr. Death Fauci and the FDA were full of crap
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:27.060]  to be blunt back in 2020. We knew it worked. And so we just ignored everything they said
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:30.580]  and just started prescribing it all across America for free. Even though they threatened
[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:34.180]  your license and took a lot of licenses. I've had five states. They just pulled
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:38.500]  Sherry Tenpenny's license. They sure did. Absolutely. Some murders. A lot of the doctors
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:42.580]  on the right side of this have been under constant nonstop attack. Medical boards trying
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:52.100]  to take our licenses. Absolutely. And FDA website admits SV40 in the COVID vaccines,
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:56.420]  cancer virus, Google blocks it all, tells you it's not there. That's aid and abetting murder.
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:11:02.260]  Absolutely. This is intentional. This is an intentional call of the human herd.
[02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:06.820]  But you know, Dr. Aptor, he's one of our doctors, Dr. Aptor, Dr. Bowden and Dr.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:11.620]  Paul Merrick. They filed the lawsuit against the FDA. The FDA had to finally admit that yes,
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:16.260]  it is legal for doctors to prescribe ivermectin. And so I thought in honor of that,
[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:20.180]  we should celebrate by taking a dose live on air. So I brought some ivermectin.
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:22.660]  There's actually big reports that I've seen that it's anti-cancer.
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:28.260]  As well, there are reports. But I've also read long-term it can hurt the liver. Is that true?
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:31.460]  So we need to be a little careful with this. Yeah, it's a great safe drug. It's safer than
[02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:38.900]  Tylenol. They're not trying to blame autism on Tylenol alone. It's nuts.
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:45.060]  Where should we begin? There's so much to hit here. This is a big deal.
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:48.900]  Talk about the ivermectin situation, the studies, the court rulings, the FDA saying,
[02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:54.260]  back off. Yeah, it works. Correct. Myfreedoctor.com has
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:59.300]  settled the science. We have delivered over 300,000 free doctor visits to America,
[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:02.980]  prescribing ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, and the other drugs in the multiple drug
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:08.980]  early treatment protocol. We have only lost six patients out of 300,000. That's a 99.99%
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:14.340]  survival rate. We have settled the science. Multiple drug early treatment wins the COVID wars,
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:18.580]  period. Period. We know these drugs work. Our patients don't.
[02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:21.860]  And Fauci had a study in 2014 that was good for SARS.
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:23.780]  Correct. That little bastard knew what he was doing all along.
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:30.100]  He knew it all along. He needs to be arrested and thrown in jail. We need
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:34.500]  Nuremberg 2.0 as soon as possible. All the fake doctor poison pushers need to be
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:38.980]  arrested and thrown in prison. And I would say the same for the politicians pushing this
[02:12:38.980 --> 02:12:43.540]  poison as well. That's the problem. The politicians push it, all the doctors push it,
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:47.540]  and nobody's being held accountable for pushing this mass genocide on the world.
[02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:56.180]  It's just so insane that he put a study out and wrote about studies in 2014 saying
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:59.780]  ivermectin does incredible things to SARS family of viruses, and then he blocked it.
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:03.620]  Man, that's just cold blooded killer. In 2005, he published a study that showed
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:08.420]  hydroxychloroquine worked for SARS-1. And it's rumored I have a friend that was on the
[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:13.380]  presidential COVID task force that said Fauci admitted he was taking hydroxychloroquine
[02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:18.180]  in 2020. I would love to find out if that was true or not, but he needs to be held accountable.
[02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:23.060]  He needs to be arrested. I tell people he's the most prolific mass murderer in the history of
[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:27.460]  the world. He definitely makes Joseph Mengele look like the mini me. And now the FDA,
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:31.140]  with all these lawsuits, says, well, we have sovereign immunity for blocking ivermectin.
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:40.500]  Yeah, the FDA, I call them the Food and Death Administration, everybody at the FDA should be
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:44.580]  arrested. All the leadership should be arrested. They should also be on trial. Same with the CDC,
[02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:50.180]  all the three letter agencies that have pushed this insanity. This is World Economic Forum's
[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:56.420]  great reset. I call it World War III. It started in 2020 with bioterrorism,
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:14:00.420]  and then they hacked the presidential election, and it's been downhill ever since.
[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:08.180]  It's a globalist administrative coup. They can not cut down the trees around the power lines,
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:11.780]  leave the power on during a windstorm. I mean, it's just there's millions of ways they can
[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:15.300]  attack us. We got to realize they're going to use our modern infrastructure now against us
[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:19.700]  while they collapse. Absolutely. That's what they're doing. This is the attempted
[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:24.660]  take down of America, and it's in progress. And that's why they're trying to...
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:27.780]  America is at war fighting for its life right now. We are at war. That's what a lot of
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:31.460]  people talk about World War III as if it's in the future. It started three years ago,
[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:35.220]  and people need to wake up and realize we are at war. This is a literal war,
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:38.740]  and they're trying to kill all of us. I want to play a clip when we come back.
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:43.460]  They already played once, but it's Senator Josh Hawley on Fox, and he says they're criminalizing
[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:48.340]  their political opposition. They're calling us all terrorists. They're creating a one-party
[02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:55.460]  dictatorship. Now, I've said that like a parrot, but it's true. The fact is they're listening.
[02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:58.820]  The resistance is listening. People know. We know what we're talking about because I've actually
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:02.740]  studied all the geopolitical history and stuff, which most people don't do. I get it. Most
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:08.500]  people haven't read close to a thousand books on this. I have. I'm trying to brag. This is
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:13.940]  what I do, folks. But it's not hard to know they're doing this either, but we have to face
[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:18.580]  that it's happening. Absolutely. I call it the PC cult unit party. They control both
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:21.700]  sides of the aisle. They control the Democrat party and the Republican party.
[02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:25.540]  They control all three branches of the US government. We are living under communist
[02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:30.500]  occupation. We're in occupied America right now. The communists are in control.
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:35.140]  Well, Trump says that I agree, but if you look at Henry history and they say globally,
[02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:38.660]  it's a fascist model. They're above the law and don't pay taxes. Then they use a communist
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:44.580]  model on the ground. So it's a communist system using a fascist system, using a communist
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:50.500]  enforcement mechanism, the techno crazy that have been marbles. Our guests stay with us.

[02:19:56.100 --> 02:20:05.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:07.210 --> 02:20:32.210]  They're gliding the streets, it's up to my ankles She glides the streets, it's up to
[02:20:33.210 --> 02:20:41.210]  She glides the streets, it's up to my knees She glides in the streets of the town of Chicago
[02:20:42.210 --> 02:20:47.210]  She glides on the rise she followed with me She denied the break ok
[02:20:48.210 --> 02:20:50.210]  She came in and she cruised
[02:20:50.210 --> 02:20:59.210]  Here's the bottom line folks, we wouldn't have come out of this covet tyranny if it partially wasn't for the tens of thousands of doctors and nurses around the western world who stood up and told the truth.
[02:20:59.210 --> 02:21:02.050]  world that stood up and told the truth. And right there at the top of the list is
[02:21:02.050 --> 02:21:07.210]  Dr. Ben Marble, who doesn't just run MyFreeDoctor.com. You also still work
[02:21:07.210 --> 02:21:09.609]  in the ER and you were telling me during the break what you're seeing
[02:21:09.609 --> 02:21:13.330]  from the vaccine damage. Correct I'm seeing about four or five vaccine
[02:21:13.330 --> 02:21:17.689]  injured patients per shift and some horrible things that I'm seeing with
[02:21:17.689 --> 02:21:21.169]  these people like for example I had one young girl she was about 20 she'd
[02:21:21.169 --> 02:21:24.730]  had two pregnancies lost in the past ten months she was on her third
[02:21:24.730 --> 02:21:28.849]  pregnancy around six weeks pregnant she keeps passing out has what's
[02:21:28.849 --> 02:21:33.689]  called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome she keep passing out and
[02:21:33.689 --> 02:21:37.449]  then no other doctors can figure out what's wrong with her and so I asked her
[02:21:37.449 --> 02:21:40.669]  okay so sounds to me like you probably took a COVID vaccine right
[02:21:40.669 --> 02:21:43.890]  before all this started right she's like oh yeah I sure I sure did and
[02:21:43.890 --> 02:21:46.410]  there was like a light bulb went off in her head she realized that it was
[02:21:46.410 --> 02:21:50.970]  the vaccine that did it. What do you make of all the news coming out 20
[02:21:50.970 --> 02:21:56.490]  million dead worldwide major insurance actuaries we've got it's all these
[02:21:56.490 --> 02:22:00.050]  reports I mean look at this London Telegraph heart attacks at record level
[02:22:00.050 --> 02:22:04.130]  after pandemic they can't cover this up. This is the mass die-off I predicted
[02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:07.269]  two years ago I was a little early on that prediction I thought it was
[02:22:07.269 --> 02:22:10.210]  gonna happen a little sooner than it did but it's the mass die-off it's in
[02:22:10.210 --> 02:22:15.970]  progress you know they you know rats in a mousetrap they don't understand
[02:22:15.970 --> 02:22:20.529]  why the cheese is free right this they gave away 12 billion doses of free
[02:22:20.529 --> 02:22:25.529]  poison poisoning over five billion people with these COVID-19 fake
[02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:30.210]  vaccines and now the mass die-off is in progress people dropping like flies
[02:22:30.210 --> 02:22:33.849]  died and suddenly all over the world and they're blaming on global warming oh
[02:22:33.849 --> 02:22:36.609]  now yeah that's the big scan now they're blaming it all on global
[02:22:36.609 --> 02:22:40.730]  warming and no it's not global warming it's everybody that's dropping
[02:22:40.730 --> 02:22:43.650]  dead they all have one thing in common they all took the poison people like
[02:22:43.650 --> 02:22:47.250]  it's really hot in the summer that's why everybody's dying yeah no summer
[02:22:47.250 --> 02:22:53.089]  happens you know it's absurd the level of gaslighting with the other side the
[02:22:53.089 --> 02:22:59.330]  PC cult but the scary thing is that people believe it show the footage of
[02:22:59.330 --> 02:23:04.890]  the woman in Portland putting her butt on the water fountain all right this is
[02:23:04.890 --> 02:23:08.009]  a woman having sex with the water fountain if you go to Portland folks
[02:23:08.009 --> 02:23:14.330]  this is we've sent reporters this is not hard to find okay this is going on
[02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:19.130]  absolutely everywhere I mean this is Sodom and Gomorrah this is the collapse
[02:23:19.130 --> 02:23:25.089]  of civilization absolutely we're seeing it globally just and look at the guy
[02:23:25.089 --> 02:23:29.689]  walking by her I mean he looks like a vampire and they're under a spirit
[02:23:29.689 --> 02:23:33.490]  right well it's like the Bible says cities will go under a demon I mean
[02:23:33.490 --> 02:23:37.730]  they important one is gone it's certainly look demon-possessed I mean
[02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:43.050]  look at that guy freeze-frame it when he walks by and looks just another
[02:23:43.050 --> 02:23:48.289]  day in Portland and blow that guy's face up I mean zoom that in if you
[02:23:48.289 --> 02:23:54.009]  can I mean what is going on here and you pull up shots of antifa or shots of
[02:23:54.009 --> 02:23:57.410]  the people that posted they got shots they all look like that a lot of the
[02:23:57.410 --> 02:24:00.330]  people who took the poison now have brain damage and so they're acting
[02:24:00.330 --> 02:24:03.810]  out on their brain damage so this is the zombie apocalypse because the the
[02:24:03.810 --> 02:24:08.169]  fake vaccine poison have turned these people into zombies look she's got
[02:24:08.169 --> 02:24:15.210]  cigarette burns all over her legs Wow self-harming this guy's walking by I
[02:24:15.410 --> 02:24:21.169]  mean what happened to these people I need help that's for sure they need to
[02:24:21.169 --> 02:24:26.929]  talk to God because there's there on the straight they're heading for straight
[02:24:26.929 --> 02:24:31.650]  to hell is where where I see them winding up and they're coming after our
[02:24:31.650 --> 02:24:35.330]  children show Austin with them parading last weekend hundreds of children like
[02:24:35.330 --> 02:24:40.210]  captured slaves at their pedo rally you know that's that's another thing you
[02:24:40.210 --> 02:24:42.769]  know people don't realize if you transition a child they're permanently
[02:24:42.810 --> 02:24:47.490]  sterilized transitioning is sterilization and that's everything that the PC cult
[02:24:47.490 --> 02:24:51.410]  favors is about reducing population globally and that's why they want you
[02:24:51.410 --> 02:24:55.410]  know they favor birth control abortion assisted suicide at the end of
[02:24:55.410 --> 02:24:59.250]  life they want to transition your children because the transition child is
[02:24:59.250 --> 02:25:01.730]  sterilized child and I want to be clear we're gonna play clip from a
[02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:04.929]  doctor wrote a book about this we're getting on male feminization chemicals
[02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:07.929]  and drinking water I had Blair White in here last week Blair White is
[02:25:07.929 --> 02:25:11.210]  against the force of kids the pedophilia all of it Blair White
[02:25:11.210 --> 02:25:17.130]  believes the chemicals changed Blair into being a woman I don't hate people I
[02:25:17.130 --> 02:25:20.849]  don't hate frogs that have been turned feminine by the chemicals I hate the
[02:25:20.849 --> 02:25:23.609]  agenda and the globalists that are doing it people that target children
[02:25:23.609 --> 02:25:26.929]  show let's go and play this quick clip where the stockers written a book
[02:25:26.929 --> 02:25:30.650]  about this breaks down the numbers they call it male feminization
[02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:34.810]  whenever you're adding all these chemicals atrazine is the big one
[02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:37.929]  that's often studies this it's a herbicide it's the second most used
[02:25:37.929 --> 02:25:40.689]  herbicide in North America if you've heard of atrazine right yeah it's in
[02:25:40.689 --> 02:25:43.769]  the drinking water totally illegal in Europe they don't even allow it in
[02:25:43.769 --> 02:25:48.890]  Europe and in America it's the second most used after glyphosate but they'll
[02:25:48.890 --> 02:25:52.490]  call it male feminization you give these animals atrazine exposures and
[02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:57.289]  they're equal exposures to a lot of Americans and like for example if you
[02:25:57.289 --> 02:26:00.689]  have a frog and you've got him in 200 nanograms per deciliter of
[02:26:00.689 --> 02:26:04.650]  atrazine 200 that male frog turns female now you've got a female frog
[02:26:04.650 --> 02:26:07.730]  but it's not just actually because you're now you got the plastic water
[02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:10.089]  bottles oh and you've got all this fragrance of all these parabens
[02:26:10.089 --> 02:26:13.570]  rubbing it on your skin your skin is absorbing all stuff oh and now you've
[02:26:13.570 --> 02:26:16.289]  got like sunscreen chemicals right we haven't even talked about that but
[02:26:16.289 --> 02:26:20.810]  oxybenzone in sunscreen by far the most widely used chemical in
[02:26:20.810 --> 02:26:24.769]  sunscreen that's an estrogen endocrine disruptor it acts like estrogen in
[02:26:24.769 --> 02:26:27.970]  your body and they did a study after I published my book they did a study
[02:26:27.970 --> 02:26:33.849]  with oxybenzone and one application of sunscreen just one seven days later
[02:26:33.849 --> 02:26:37.890]  it was above the government safety limits in people's blood that's just
[02:26:37.890 --> 02:26:42.130]  an adult with one application of oxybenzone and some people are putting
[02:26:42.130 --> 02:26:47.169]  on their kids like five days a week I was like personal care products that
[02:26:47.169 --> 02:26:50.250]  brag about like keeping your face protected from something they call it
[02:26:50.250 --> 02:26:54.330]  male feminization all right so I had Blair White on who admits all this
[02:26:54.330 --> 02:26:58.089]  is going on and says that you know that they're against it and then I
[02:26:58.089 --> 02:27:01.689]  love being attacked I don't mind but the fake right-wing I oh look he
[02:27:01.689 --> 02:27:05.330]  doesn't hate these people well Blair's not going after kids Blair thinks the
[02:27:05.369 --> 02:27:08.210]  chemicals did this we know this do we hate the frogs that have been changed
[02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:11.769]  no we hate those that are doing it correct you know I saw a lot of
[02:27:11.769 --> 02:27:14.849]  people giving you a hard time all that about it it's ridiculous you know there
[02:27:14.849 --> 02:27:17.929]  there were trainees in Jesus this time they were called eunuchs back
[02:27:17.929 --> 02:27:21.849]  then and Jesus said to love everybody so you know how dare you love
[02:27:21.849 --> 02:27:25.929]  everybody so I think it's absurd for them to try to attack you for that
[02:27:25.929 --> 02:27:30.089]  well I don't like the people going after kids but when somebody says
[02:27:30.089 --> 02:27:32.849]  they're against it has been fighting against it and says yeah the chemicals
[02:27:32.849 --> 02:27:38.169]  did this to me what do we do about a frog that wants to have sex with a male
[02:27:38.169 --> 02:27:42.730]  frog because the chemicals do we hate the frog no absolutely not and of course
[02:27:42.730 --> 02:27:46.689]  that receives banned all the world but here yeah it's you know the chemicals
[02:27:46.689 --> 02:27:50.050]  they're trying to get us any way they can as far as population
[02:27:50.050 --> 02:27:53.410]  reduction whether it's chemicals in the food or the water now they want to
[02:27:53.410 --> 02:27:57.849]  put the MRI in mRNA shots in into the beef and the cattle and we're
[02:27:57.849 --> 02:28:01.570]  talking about alpha-gal center when we come back but yeah I mean look they
[02:28:01.570 --> 02:28:04.970]  want to do this to these people and then control them after they've abused
[02:28:04.970 --> 02:28:08.210]  them and mutated them we need to reach out to people explain what's been done
[02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:11.410]  to them correct people need to understand what's going on and
[02:28:11.410 --> 02:28:17.089]  certainly if you've been exposed to these chemicals they will feminize you
[02:28:17.089 --> 02:28:20.650]  well I say we see a frogs would feminize we've got to not talk to it
[02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:27.570]  then it's it's kind of ridiculous what it is is unbelievable and we're all
[02:28:27.570 --> 02:28:30.009]  being hit by this we're all being mutated right now we have to admit
[02:28:30.009 --> 02:28:33.849]  that we're all in this together yes we are and now they want to officially
[02:28:33.849 --> 02:28:39.970]  you know put my fast track our children with the chemicals we have to admit it's
[02:28:39.970 --> 02:28:43.449]  there have a debate about it and stop it we need to put a stop to all this
[02:28:43.449 --> 02:28:47.089]  mad science that's going on the world certainly the chemicals the
[02:28:47.089 --> 02:28:50.269]  mutant mosquitoes the fake vaccine let's talk about the mutant mosquitoes

[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:05.519]  it's Alex Jones
[02:33:07.210 --> 02:33:25.210]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex
[02:33:25.210 --> 02:33:26.210]  Jones.
[02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:35.449]  Well, the good news is the globalists wanted to hit us flat foot and not be aware of all
[02:33:35.449 --> 02:33:40.089]  this, but M4S, thanks for all your support, has really been at the heart of the fight,
[02:33:40.089 --> 02:33:44.009]  at the front lines, tip of the spear, whatever you want to call it, and we are really giving
[02:33:44.009 --> 02:33:45.009]  them a run for their money.
[02:33:45.009 --> 02:33:48.849]  That would have been marble. You've got so many points to get into, so many angles,
[02:33:48.849 --> 02:33:50.970]  so many things to get into. You've got the floor.
[02:33:50.970 --> 02:33:55.650]  Appreciate it. I wanted to give a shout out to my friends at $50iGuy. They got
[02:33:55.650 --> 02:34:01.609]  me these glasses here and also professional pharmacy resources in Pace, Florida. $50iGuy
[02:34:01.609 --> 02:34:07.730]  is a friend of mine in Pensacola, Florida. They're a great patriotic company.
[02:34:07.730 --> 02:34:12.250]  There's so much to talk about. People who have been poisoned, they need meds on hand,
[02:34:12.250 --> 02:34:16.929]  so go to myfreedoctor.com. The people that are dying when they catch COVID are the
[02:34:16.929 --> 02:34:21.130]  people who've had three and four shots, so if you had three, four, or five shots,
[02:34:21.130 --> 02:34:25.849]  you need early treatment more than the person that took zero shots that has natural immunity.
[02:34:25.849 --> 02:34:28.210]  We treat everybody for free, so I would encourage you.
[02:34:28.210 --> 02:34:29.689]  And COVID deaths are quote up.
[02:34:29.929 --> 02:34:35.970]  They're way up, and we're seeing another wave right now. It's certainly in Florida
[02:34:35.970 --> 02:34:40.609]  and in Alabama, so I would encourage everybody to go to myfreedoctor.com to go ahead and get
[02:34:40.609 --> 02:34:45.250]  your meds on hand. Even if you're not sick yet, just go there. We'll get your meds sent to
[02:34:45.250 --> 02:34:48.410]  you so you have them so you can start treatment on day one. You don't want to delay treatment
[02:34:48.410 --> 02:34:53.330]  when you get sick is the point, and if you took the poison, then there's things you
[02:34:53.330 --> 02:34:56.689]  need to be doing. Which the University of Colorado admits is shedding now.
[02:34:56.890 --> 02:35:05.089]  Shedding is very real. The biggest thing to mention on the shedding front is that pregnant women should
[02:35:05.089 --> 02:35:10.730]  not be around people who took the poison because they're likely to have a miscarriage if they are.
[02:35:10.730 --> 02:35:12.169]  Keep going.
[02:35:12.169 --> 02:35:17.849]  But everybody should probably be on once a week Ivermectin. There's over-the-counter
[02:35:17.849 --> 02:35:19.089]  treatments you can take.
[02:35:19.089 --> 02:35:23.250]  That's what my medical doctor, who's not even part of the show, said. We're recommending,
[02:35:23.250 --> 02:35:26.689]  in the game of the dose I've got at my office, two Ivermectin pills a week.
[02:35:26.689 --> 02:35:27.369]  Correct.
[02:35:27.369 --> 02:35:29.050]  They said it's everything.
[02:35:29.050 --> 02:35:33.009]  It has a lot of great properties. It's a wonderful, safe drug, safer than Tylenol.
[02:35:34.009 --> 02:35:34.609]  What does it do?
[02:35:34.609 --> 02:35:40.570]  It's difficult to explain, but certainly it's an anti-parasitic. Now if you think of a virus,
[02:35:40.570 --> 02:35:47.730]  all a virus is really is a small, super tiny parasite. A virus cannot live outside of a cell.
[02:35:47.730 --> 02:35:51.929]  It's an intracellular parasite, basically. So think of a virus as a miniature
[02:35:51.929 --> 02:35:54.849]  parasite, and then you'll understand why Ivermectin works.
[02:35:54.849 --> 02:35:56.849]  Do you know about the invention of Ivermectin by the Japanese?
[02:35:56.849 --> 02:36:01.169]  Correct. It won the Nobel Prize in medicine because it's such a good,
[02:36:01.169 --> 02:36:05.570]  wonderful drug. They found it in the soil when they originally discovered it,
[02:36:05.570 --> 02:36:07.890]  and that's why they won the Nobel Prize.
[02:36:07.890 --> 02:36:12.849]  Well, what I read is their carp kept dying, and so the first thing they noticed was they
[02:36:12.849 --> 02:36:15.730]  gave it to carp. They didn't get sick and die and live a lot longer, so then they
[02:36:15.730 --> 02:36:17.089]  started testing it in humans for other things.
[02:36:17.410 --> 02:36:23.410]  Correct, and it has a lot of wonderful benefits overall. Certainly it's good for parasites.
[02:36:23.410 --> 02:36:27.089]  It's good. We know it's good for COVID. We've used it in 300,000 patients,
[02:36:27.890 --> 02:36:30.609]  and some people are saying it has anti-cancer properties.
[02:36:30.609 --> 02:36:32.769]  That's what Judy Megavit says. She just says it stops the
[02:36:32.769 --> 02:36:34.849]  replication of things in our part of your body.
[02:36:34.849 --> 02:36:38.689]  Correct, and we're seeing these people getting all these turbo cancers. Who is it
[02:36:38.689 --> 02:36:41.250]  that's getting these turbo cancers? It's the people who took the shots.
[02:36:41.250 --> 02:36:45.410]  For example, my sister-in-law passed away a week ago. She was healthy and fine,
[02:36:45.490 --> 02:36:50.289]  took the shots. Six months later, she gets diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer.
[02:36:50.289 --> 02:36:55.490]  She's now dead. My uncle took the Moderna shot two weeks later. He had a Widowmaker MI,
[02:36:55.490 --> 02:37:00.050]  so it's affected my life personally with my friends and family,
[02:37:00.689 --> 02:37:03.089]  and I hear these horror stories every day all around.
[02:37:04.210 --> 02:37:07.970]  And that's not anecdotal. The numbers show 20 million dead.
[02:37:07.970 --> 02:37:10.849]  Correct. I think it's going to wind up being much higher. I mean,
[02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:13.730]  I'm predicting at least a billion people are going to die from this poison.
[02:37:15.730 --> 02:37:18.769]  It's the greatest mass poison in the history of the world is what we've just witnessed,
[02:37:19.410 --> 02:37:23.890]  and so it's taken two to three years to see the outcome of that,
[02:37:23.890 --> 02:37:28.449]  but now we're just seeing people dropping like flies, dying suddenly all over the world.
[02:37:28.449 --> 02:37:33.169]  What about, they say a new virus is coming, and they're going to have new lockdowns.
[02:37:33.169 --> 02:37:35.570]  What are some of the things they're trying to hype up? Because monkey pox,
[02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:39.570]  people didn't buy that. Well, certainly, they released the
[02:37:39.570 --> 02:37:43.330]  mutant mosquitoes in Florida. This is where I would call on Governor DeSantis,
[02:37:43.330 --> 02:37:47.089]  why are you letting them release mutant mosquitoes in Florida? We need to put a stop.
[02:37:47.089 --> 02:37:51.009]  No mutant mosquitoes because when they released the mutant mosquitoes in South America,
[02:37:51.009 --> 02:37:53.169]  the mosquito-borne illnesses went through the roof.
[02:37:53.169 --> 02:37:55.490]  By the way, listen to this. It doesn't even sound real.
[02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:58.769]  Don't release the mutant mosquitoes. Sounds like the start of a zombie movie.
[02:37:58.769 --> 02:38:01.250]  I know. It's crazy. I can't even believe I'm having to say this.
[02:38:01.250 --> 02:38:05.009]  We're the extremists. Don't release the mutant mosquitoes from Bill Gates.
[02:38:05.009 --> 02:38:08.769]  Correct. Bill Gates is clearly a bad person. I call him Bill Gates of hell.
[02:38:08.769 --> 02:38:11.890]  He needs to be arrested on trial of Nuremberg 2.0 as soon as possible,
[02:38:12.529 --> 02:38:17.810]  but now we're having a dang fever outbreak in Florida, and it's a great mystery.
[02:38:17.810 --> 02:38:21.250]  No, it's not a great mystery. It's because they released the mutant mosquitoes in Florida.
[02:38:22.769 --> 02:38:26.050]  Which happened in South America? We're seeing the same thing with malaria.
[02:38:26.050 --> 02:38:29.490]  We're seeing a lot more malaria cases now. Where has that happened? That's happened.
[02:38:29.490 --> 02:38:34.050]  We'll type the headline in from A.P. and Reuters. Majority of new polio cases caused
[02:38:34.050 --> 02:38:38.609]  by a vaccine, and it mentions Bill and Melinda Gates. So this is not even two plus two
[02:38:38.609 --> 02:38:45.810]  equals four. This is, they do this to us. The billionaire class are intentionally
[02:38:45.810 --> 02:38:50.210]  poisoning people, releasing this mad science on the world. Mutant mosquitoes,
[02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:54.130]  they want to, like in Australia now, they're mandating they have to give the cows and
[02:38:54.130 --> 02:39:00.689]  the pigs the mRNA fake vaccine so that the mRNA, the spike protein is the bioweapon.
[02:39:00.689 --> 02:39:04.769]  It's in the food supply now. So when you eat a global ban on the spike protein,
[02:39:04.769 --> 02:39:09.009]  that's one thing to start. You know, if you want to start fixing these problems and solving them,
[02:39:09.009 --> 02:39:13.890]  we need to ban the spike protein globally. It's straight up poison. It's a bioweapon.
[02:39:13.890 --> 02:39:18.130]  They released this bioweapon on us in 2020. That's when World War Three started,
[02:39:18.130 --> 02:39:21.490]  and we need to put a stop to it. Don't you say ban it. It's in the shots.
[02:39:21.490 --> 02:39:23.570]  It is in the shots. A self-replicating
[02:39:23.570 --> 02:39:25.970]  nanotech. That's what Judy Minkovitch said yesterday.
[02:39:25.970 --> 02:39:30.050]  Absolutely. You know, we've had over seven million, over seven million are dead now in
[02:39:30.050 --> 02:39:32.689]  three years of this war, over seven million dead, over five billion.
[02:39:32.769 --> 02:39:35.250]  Well, the numbers we're getting from prestigious stoppers in Europe is 20 million.
[02:39:35.890 --> 02:39:41.410]  Correct. Okay. So I hadn't read those late, but yeah, 20 million dead. So we're seeing
[02:39:41.410 --> 02:39:44.929]  massive death all over the world, and nobody can figure out what's going on.
[02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:47.330]  We know what's going on. They're poisonous all on purpose.
[02:39:49.810 --> 02:39:54.529]  It's nuts. It's crazy, mad science, and somebody needs to put a stop to it. We need to start
[02:39:54.529 --> 02:39:57.650]  holding these poison pushers accountable, especially the politicians.
[02:39:57.650 --> 02:40:01.009]  The foxes guarding the henhouse. They're not going to arrest themselves.
[02:40:01.009 --> 02:40:04.769]  The fake doctor poison pushers, they're caught in a legal trap. Once they recommended the poison,
[02:40:04.769 --> 02:40:07.570]  they can't tell their patients, oh, I've been telling you all to take poison because then
[02:40:07.570 --> 02:40:09.970]  they'll get sued for malpractice. That was the setup.
[02:40:09.970 --> 02:40:15.169]  That is the setup, and the bad doctors fell for it. November 2020, I told all of our patients,
[02:40:15.169 --> 02:40:18.769]  do not take a single dose of any of these poisons. They're going to be bad.
[02:40:18.769 --> 02:40:22.289]  It was easy to predict. I read the science. I read the studies. All the animals in the
[02:40:22.289 --> 02:40:27.890]  studies, 80% of them died. So how's this going to be good for humans?
[02:40:27.890 --> 02:40:31.490]  They did change nothing. A little time passed, and they said, let's start giving it to people.
[02:40:31.490 --> 02:40:33.890]  Well, let's talk about you because this is what's crazy.
[02:40:35.810 --> 02:40:37.810]  You didn't say to say this on air, but I'm going to just say it.
[02:40:39.089 --> 02:40:45.089]  You gave 300,000 patients things. You let them do it via donation with an online pharmacy.
[02:40:45.089 --> 02:40:47.490]  They tried to stop you. You've been vindicated, proven right.
[02:40:47.490 --> 02:40:53.009]  You are still full time working in an ER to pay your bills because you didn't get enough
[02:40:53.009 --> 02:40:56.210]  donations to even pay your operators and doctors and pharmacists.
[02:40:58.769 --> 02:41:02.609]  You should be doing this full time. It's the same with us. We're barely funding things,
[02:41:02.609 --> 02:41:05.890]  and we're doing all this great work. I'm not complaining. It's just that look at Bill Gates
[02:41:05.890 --> 02:41:10.609]  making hundreds of billions killing people, and you're working full time while running a company
[02:41:10.609 --> 02:41:13.650]  that gives people free health care because they're not making enough donations. It's just
[02:41:13.650 --> 02:41:17.250]  it's emblematic of the issue. Absolutely. Well, I feel like God has
[02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:22.609]  blessed me with this ability to do this. I'm thankful and grateful to have the opportunity
[02:41:22.609 --> 02:41:25.890]  to be able to do what I'm doing. I just asked you how you were doing,
[02:41:25.890 --> 02:41:28.689]  and you were like, I'm doing pretty good. I'm just trying to pay my bills,
[02:41:28.689 --> 02:41:33.810]  and here you are saving all these people. You can't even pay your bills. It's insane.
[02:41:34.609 --> 02:41:39.490]  It is, but that's what we're dealing with, the level of evil and insanity that's coming
[02:41:39.490 --> 02:41:43.570]  down against our doctors. There's about 12 doctors on our team. We've had about 30
[02:41:43.570 --> 02:41:47.970]  doctors total on our team. Eight of our doctors nominated for the Nobel Prize. I was nominated
[02:41:47.970 --> 02:41:54.210]  for a Nobel Prize. It's not to brag, but the people need to listen to the doctors who got it
[02:41:54.210 --> 02:41:59.810]  right from day one. Don't listen to the poison pushing fake doctors. All the doctors were in one
[02:41:59.810 --> 02:42:03.570]  of three groups with respect to these fake vaccine poisons. There were the poison pushers
[02:42:03.570 --> 02:42:07.490]  who were in favor of it. There were the right docs of history who opposed it from day
[02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:11.169]  one, and then there were the third group, the defense writers. They were the bargainers. They
[02:42:11.169 --> 02:42:16.689]  said, well, don't give it to children, but do give it to old people. Oddly enough,
[02:42:16.689 --> 02:42:21.490]  what the media did was the media made the poison pushers or the bargainers, they made those doctors
[02:42:21.490 --> 02:42:27.089]  famous while they pretended the right docs of history don't exist. They pretended there were
[02:42:27.089 --> 02:42:31.410]  zero doctors that opposed these shots. There's a few of us, I've got around 50 of us in the
[02:42:31.410 --> 02:42:36.369]  right docs of history group who opposed these shots from day one. Doctors like Jim Thorpe,
[02:42:36.369 --> 02:42:44.529]  Judy Mikovits. I'm glad you work at a ER, but this is a company, you serve 300,000 people.
[02:42:45.250 --> 02:42:47.970]  You're literally getting no money and you should be doing that full time.
[02:42:49.970 --> 02:42:53.970]  That's not supposed to be on air. I'm just pointing out, folks, how ridiculous this is,
[02:42:53.970 --> 02:42:55.810]  how ass backwards this is. We'll be right back.
[02:42:57.410 --> 02:43:01.009]  Coffee has not been available at info war store.com for two years
[02:43:01.009 --> 02:43:04.210]  because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[02:43:04.210 --> 02:43:08.449]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us,
[02:43:08.449 --> 02:43:11.650]  but when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees,
[02:43:11.650 --> 02:43:16.609]  I was blown away. We finally have three great coffees that are the best I have to offer
[02:43:16.609 --> 02:43:20.449]  available to you right now. This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[02:43:20.449 --> 02:43:24.210]  It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[02:43:24.210 --> 02:43:29.169]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available
[02:43:29.169 --> 02:43:35.009]  at info war store.com exclusively escape the prison planet. Light roast tastes great.

[02:44:01.730 --> 02:44:07.890]  of our entire food supply. Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential
[02:44:07.890 --> 02:44:13.009]  trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:44:13.009 --> 02:44:19.169]  And there are two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming.

[02:46:56.100 --> 02:47:05.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:25.600]  It's the time of the season, when love runs high.
[02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:30.600]  In this time, give it to me.
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:36.600]  And let me try, with pleasure hands, to take you in the sun.
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:39.600]  The amazing Dr. Ben Marble of myfreedaughter.com,
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:44.600]  where you can get free consultations and everything to put you in touch with all the things you need,
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:47.600]  is here, an amazing guy.
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:51.600]  I wonder how you do it for free, though, with small donations, and you're just fighting hard.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:54.600]  But we've got to end this hard here,
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:59.600]  because a special guest is coming up with some other big guest that she's got on the show, Kate Alley.
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:04.600]  And then I'm going to tape a multi-hour show with Mickey Willis.
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:08.600]  He'll be on it for one hour, but I'm going to do a whole hour on a deep dive on Bill Gates.
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:10.600]  You think you've seen it all? You haven't, folks.
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:12.600]  We've even found clips I never saw.
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:15.600]  I'm going to tape it today. We're going to send it to Steven Crowder tomorrow.
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:19.600]  It's going to premiere tomorrow afternoon at lighterwithcrowdr.com.
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:23.600]  Go to jonescrowdr.com, get one free month for a year free,
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:28.600]  and I'm going to start that weekly special show, then we're going to start more shows.
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:31.600]  If you want to support the broadcast and fund the Tip of the Spear
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:35.600]  and get access to not just my show, but Crowder's subscription services

[02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:41.600]  go to jonescrowdr.com today if you want to fund this operation,
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:44.600]  because we're not funded by the globalists.
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:48.600]  They're squeezing us all, but we are having the biggest awakening ever.
[02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:54.600]  There are some huge announcements coming very, very soon, some big events, some big things happening.
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:57.600]  I'm not bragging. I'm just letting you know the good news.
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:03.600]  It's not just Senator Josh Hawley saying, hey, it's a one-party system.
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:06.600]  They're taking over the dictatorship. They're outlawing their opposition.
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:11.600]  We understand the analysis, and it's getting picked up by everybody.
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:14.600]  They understand it now, and I've got to tell you,
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:19.600]  it's a lot of people in every sector of the economy all over the world
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:23.600]  in the military, in academia, in the ecclesiastical area.
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:26.600]  Everywhere, it's on, big time.
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:30.600]  So thank you all for your support. I'm going to steadfastly continue on.
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:32.600]  No matter what happens, I'm totally committed to you.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:35.600]  I'm totally committed to my family, and we're all in this together.
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:38.600]  For my family to be free, your family's got to be free.
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:43.600]  This is a new world order, technocracy, corporate attack, a new type of war.
[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:45.600]  But we're learning about it. We're understanding it.
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:48.600]  The learning curve's going straight up. We're going to win.
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:50.600]  Dr. Ben Marble, we only got about nine minutes left.
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:52.600]  You're going to be on the war room today with the great Owen Schroyer.
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:54.600]  What else do you want to impart to this audience?
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:56.600]  Well, one thing I wanted to mention is, you know,
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:01.600]  the Elon Musk versus Marxist-Mark MMA fight that was supposed to happen.
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:02.600]  Let me see that.
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:04.600]  I remember you on my show challenging him to a fight.
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:05.600]  I think you probably inspired that.
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:06.600]  June of 2021.
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:07.600]  One more shot, please.
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:09.600]  I came up with the nickname Zuck the Cuck.
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:11.600]  I even made ZucktheCuck.com.
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:14.600]  Z-U-C-H-E-C-U-C.com.
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:18.600]  And I challenged Marxist-Mark to an MMA-style fight.
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:19.600]  Now, supposedly-
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:20.600]  Now, read to folks what you said on here.
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:22.600]  This is what I said, June of 2021.
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:27.600]  I'd like to challenge Mark Zuckerberg to a mano y mano UFC-style hand-to-hand combat fight
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:31.600]  to be televised live for the world to watch me kick Zuck the Cuck fast.
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:33.600]  Someone get me in touch with Joe Rogan now.
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:36.600]  Zuck the Cuck can try, but reality cannot be deleted.
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:41.600]  So since their fight is supposedly off, I want to go ahead and issue that challenge once again
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:45.600]  to Marxist-Mark Zuck the Cuck, whatever you want to call it.
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:47.600]  Even my fat ass can beat his ass.
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:51.600]  All that fancy ching chong stuff, I'm just going to pound the living hell out of his head.
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:55.600]  Well, I would like to donate my share of the proceeds to MyFreeDoctor.com
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:58.600]  to continue helping deliver free doctor visits to America.
[02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:01.600]  So if he'll accept my challenge, Joe Rogan, get me in touch with him.
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:02.600]  Let's make it happen.
[02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:04.600]  You're actually a bigger guy than you look when you stand up.
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:06.600]  I'm 6'2", 182 pounds.
[02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:08.600]  I haven't trained to fight in years.
[02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:11.600]  I used to fight a lot when I was a teenager, but it's been a while,
[02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:14.600]  but I'll start training if he'll accept the challenge.
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:16.600]  Well, I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around, but I'll put some people on the ground.
[02:51:16.600 --> 02:51:20.600]  Well, there's a lot of people that can kick my ass, but I don't think Marxist-Mark is one of them.
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:21.600]  Yeah.
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:24.600]  But regardless, it'd be good to see you get in the ring with him.
[02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:26.600]  Yeah, I would love to get in the ring with him.
[02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:31.600]  It would be great, and we'd do it for charity and raise some money for MyFreeDoctor.com.
[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:35.600]  Well, I don't want any violence against Zuckerberg, other than if he agrees to get in the ring.
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:39.600]  We don't want Biden to get his head blown off, turns him into a victim,
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:43.600]  turns him into a, what's the word they use, a...
[02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:44.600]  Martyr?
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:45.600]  Martyr.
[02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:46.600]  We don't want that.
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:48.600]  No, you know, Jesus, the Bible says,
[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:52.600]  Vengis is mine, saith the Lord, which is interesting because, you know,
[02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:54.600]  Jesus said, live by the sword, die by the sword.
[02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:57.600]  Most people don't understand what he meant when he said that,
[02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:00.600]  because how did Jesus die?
[02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:03.600]  Well, he died on a cross, but at the end, he got jabbed with a spear through the ribs.
[02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:05.600]  All a spear is is a long sword.
[02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:06.600]  Spear of destiny.
[02:52:06.600 --> 02:52:07.600]  The spear of destiny.
[02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:09.600]  A spear is just a long sword, right?
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:13.600]  So Jesus died by a sword, and he comes back in the end in Revelation.
[02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:15.600]  A sword comes out of his mouth.
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:16.600]  And he always repeats things.
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:18.600]  At the Garden of Gethsemane, before he turned himself over,
[02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:21.600]  he cried and said, God, please, Father, pass this by me.
[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:23.600]  And God said, no, it's going to happen.
[02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:24.600]  He said, fine, I'll do it.
[02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:27.600]  But when they cut off one of the disciples' ears,
[02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:30.600]  or one of the Romans' ears, he put it back on and said,
[02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:33.600]  next time, though, sell your cloak and buy a sword.
[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:34.600]  Correct.
[02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:35.600]  Next time, I'm coming with a sword.
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:36.600]  Matthew 10, 34, he said,
[02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:39.600]  Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth.
[02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:41.600]  I have come to bring not peace, but the sword.
[02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:43.600]  And that's the point, is at the end of time,
[02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:46.600]  when Jesus comes back, which hopefully will happen soon,
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:50.600]  he kills all the evildoers with his sword.
[02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:53.600]  I think it says in Revelation, the sword of his voice.
[02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:56.600]  Sword comes out of his mouth and slays the evildoers,
[02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:59.600]  sends Satan and all to the lake of fire.
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:03.600]  So he's being loving and nice to wake us up.
[02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:05.600]  He wasn't doing that for them.
[02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:08.600]  Well, for the people who accept Jesus as their Savior
[02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:12.600]  and repent of their sins, Jesus was the sacrificial lamb
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:14.600]  that allowed us to be redeemed.
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:17.600]  And so we can be redeemed if we pray to Jesus
[02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:18.600]  and ask for forgiveness.
[02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:20.600]  And we won't get slaved by the sword,
[02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:22.600]  but the people who don't ask for forgiveness will be.
[02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:25.600]  Well, I would bet on you in a Zuckerberg fight.
[02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:26.600]  Well, thanks. I appreciate it.
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:28.600]  Everybody always thinks like kind southern gentlemen
[02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:30.600]  aren't tough. They have no idea.
[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:31.600]  No, growing up in Mississippi,
[02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:33.600]  the one thing I learned in Mississippi,
[02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:35.600]  I was born in Mississippi, but I grew up in Florida.
[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:37.600]  And then after sixth grade, we moved back to Mississippi.
[02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:40.600]  And the one thing I learned there was you had to fight.
[02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:41.600]  It was fight or die.
[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:42.600]  If you didn't learn how to fight.
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:44.600]  People don't know, it kind of ended in the 90s and stuff,
[02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:45.600]  but when I grow up,
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:47.600]  people just beat the hell out of each other.
[02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:49.600]  Correct. I was born in 1970,
[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:51.600]  and then I was in Mississippi in the 80s.
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:53.600]  And if you didn't fight, you just got beat up all the time.
[02:53:53.600 --> 02:53:55.600]  So I started taking karate and kickboxing.
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:57.600]  And back then, the cops just drove by and stopped and watched.
[02:53:57.600 --> 02:53:59.600]  Correct. Absolutely.
[02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:01.600]  I got stabbed in the leg one time in a big brawl.
[02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:03.600]  I got in a bunch of fights in high school.
[02:54:03.600 --> 02:54:06.600]  I probably had 25 street fights.
[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:07.600]  I lost two of them.
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:08.600]  I won all the rest.
[02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:11.600]  I never started any of them, but man, I mean...
[02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:13.600]  I did not start them, but I finished...
[02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:15.600]  Every time I started losing, boy, I got hurt bad.
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:17.600]  I felt bad, too.
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:19.600]  This one guy died three months after our fight from the stuff.
[02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:21.600]  He was a big convict.
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:22.600]  Started a fight with me.
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:23.600]  He started hurting me bad.
[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:24.600]  I blacked out.
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:25.600]  I beat that son of a bitch.
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:27.600]  It took him a while to die, but I felt bad about it later.
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:28.600]  I understand.
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:30.600]  I mean, certainly I had four boxer fractures
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:32.600]  when I was in high school fighting so much.
[02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:34.600]  Fighting's not good.
[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:36.600]  I eventually learned that it's better to avoid a fight
[02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:37.600]  than getting one, because, you know...
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:39.600]  You ever black out in a fight?
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:40.600]  Yeah, you just...
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:41.600]  I call it the red rage.
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:43.600]  You just go nuts and...
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:44.600]  Damn, it feels good, though.
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:45.600]  It is addicting.
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:46.600]  It is.
[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:47.600]  You know, it's like...
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:49.600]  It's like, you know...
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:52.600]  Basically, we had a fight club before we knew it was called Fight Club,
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:54.600]  and we just saw it would fight all the time.
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:56.600]  Well, it's too bad that goes on, but it's even worse now
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:54:57.600]  they don't let us fight
[02:54:57.600 --> 02:54:59.600]  because everybody just shoots each other instead.
[02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:01.600]  Yeah. Back then, you know, you just fought.
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:02.600]  You didn't bring out a knife or gun.
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:05.600]  You just would fight each other, and whoever lost, lost,
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:07.600]  and that was fun, you know.
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:08.600]  I don't know, though, man.
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:10.600]  The fights I got in were brutal.
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:11.600]  We got in some brutal fights.
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:14.600]  Last fight I got in, I knocked a guy out with a spinning back fist.
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:18.600]  It was pretty bad, but he outweighed me by, like, 40 pounds.
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:21.600]  Should have beaten me, but, you know, I'd been training a lot,
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:25.600]  and, you know, he attacked me, and so I defended myself.
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:28.600]  Typically, what would happen was, you know...
[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:30.600]  How dare you talk to my girlfriend?
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:32.600]  Well, I don't know who your girlfriend is, you know.
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:33.600]  It was usually related to...
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:35.600]  Well, that's how it always was, a woman.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:37.600]  It was always over a woman, absolutely.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:39.600]  Yeah. I guess that's an old male thing, but now that's gone,
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:41.600]  and we got a bunch of sissies.
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:42.600]  Correct.
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:43.600]  It's kind of a necessary evil.
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:46.600]  All these beta male cucks, like Zuck the Cuck, you know,
[02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:49.600]  you know, we need real men to stand up
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:51.600]  and start fighting back against all this BS,
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:54.600]  and that's why I'm willing to issue this challenge to Zuck the Cuck
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:58.600]  if he'll accept, and I'll fight him anytime, any day,
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:00.600]  but, you know, we need to do it for charity
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:04.600]  to raise money for myfreedoctor.com.
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:06.600]  Well, I'll tell you, it's really a shame.
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:07.600]  I would like to mention this.
[02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:09.600]  Anybody, if you've been poisoned,
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:11.600]  you need to go to myfreedoctor.com
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:13.600]  and go ahead and get the meds on hand.
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:15.600]  I said that earlier, but I can't overemphasize that enough
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:17.600]  because the people who are dying when they get COVID
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:20.600]  are the people who have had three and four shots.
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:23.600]  What they do is it impairs your overall immunity.
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:26.600]  We call it evades, vaccine-induced aids.
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:29.600]  So we're seeing people who've gotten these multiple shots
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:31.600]  that their immune system is just destroyed
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:34.600]  and they're coming up with all these weird, bizarre illnesses,
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:36.600]  and so those people need meds on hand
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:39.600]  because if they get COVID, they're high risk for death,
[02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:41.600]  so you need to start treatment as early as possible.
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:43.600]  So go ahead and go to myfreedoctor.com.
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:46.600]  We'll get meds to you as soon as we can.
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:50.600]  All right, what are you going to cover on Owen's show today at 3 p.m. Central?
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:51.600]  Sorry, what was that?
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:53.600]  What are you going to cover on Owen's show at 3 p.m. Central?
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:59.600]  Whatever Owen wants to talk about, probably more about the poison death shots.
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:01.600]  Well, you didn't get to some of this.
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:05.600]  COVID victims' families shoot ego out of the lines for funding releasing virus.
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:07.600]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:09.600]  Yeah, there's so many issues to touch on.
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:13.600]  The big ones, step one, stop taking poison.
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:16.600]  Step two, fire the fake doctor poison pusher.
[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:18.600]  Step three, find a real doctor.
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:20.600]  You can find a real doctor at myfreedoctor.com.
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:22.600]  None of our doctors recommend the poison.
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:24.600]  We all recommend early treatment.
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:26.600]  Well, it's not one drug.
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:28.600]  I would say ivermectin is the cornerstone drug,
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:30.600]  but there's multiple drugs in the protocol,
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:34.600]  ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, prednisone,
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:37.600]  budesonide, the over-the-counter zinc, ash.
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:39.600]  And those murders tried to block it from the people
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:41.600]  and helped kill millions of people.
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:45.600]  All right, giant fourth hour straight ahead and Owen Stroy at 3 p.m.
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:49.600]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:52.600]  that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available.
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:55.600]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:57.600]  and the quality had gone down some.
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:00.600]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:03.600]  But now we have brought back the coffee
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:06.600]  and it's even better from a national supplier
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:09.600]  that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:12.600]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:16.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting,
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:21.600]  best smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:23.600]  It is game-changing.
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:25.600]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:26.600]  I know you're going to be hooked,
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:29.600]  which will then fund our Operation A360 win.

[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:40.600]  And finally, the best tasting dark roast tip of the spear,
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:44.600]  now exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:53.600]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil,
[02:58:53.600 --> 02:58:55.600]  full spectrum of CBD oil,
[02:58:55.600 --> 02:58:57.600]  the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain,
[02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:00.600]  your entire physiological system,
[02:59:00.600 --> 02:59:02.600]  for your nervous system particularly.
[02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:04.600]  Everybody knows it's incredible it works.
[02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:06.600]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil
[02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:09.600]  you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[02:59:09.600 --> 02:59:13.600]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more
[02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:16.600]  because that's who we're getting it from,
[02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:18.600]  made right here in Central Texas.
[02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:22.600]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:26.600]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three
[02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:28.600]  or four CBD makers in the country.
[02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:29.600]  It's based right here in Texas,

[02:59:31.600 --> 02:59:32.600]  And here's what's even crazier.
[02:59:32.600 --> 02:59:34.600]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[02:59:34.600 --> 02:59:36.600]  They're selling theirs for 30% off
[02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:38.600]  what their competitors are.
[02:59:38.600 --> 02:59:41.600]  So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price,
[02:59:41.600 --> 02:59:42.600]  now even a lower price.

[02:59:50.600 --> 02:59:52.600]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:59:52.600 --> 02:59:54.600]  you are the resistance.
[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:04.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show today.
[03:00:04.600 --> 03:00:07.600]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:09.600]  Man, am I happy to see you today,
[03:00:09.600 --> 03:00:11.600]  and so glad that you're tuned in.
[03:00:11.600 --> 03:00:12.600]  It was a great conversation.
[03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:14.600]  I was listening to the tail end of that,
[03:00:14.600 --> 03:00:15.600]  and I have to agree.
[03:00:15.600 --> 03:00:18.600]  I feel like men are in a really hard position,
[03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:20.600]  and they don't know what to do.
[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:24.600]  I mean, as far as women are so kind of out of control
[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:27.600]  in so many ways in a small minority,
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:30.600]  and it doesn't speak to the rest of us women
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:34.600]  who actually really like and revere men
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:38.600]  and need them around and want them around.
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:41.600]  And I've raised boys, and let me just tell you,
[03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:43.600]  I love it that they're boys.
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:45.600]  And I used to say on the radio
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:48.600]  that if you weren't buying spray and wash
[03:00:48.600 --> 03:00:50.600]  to get the stains out of your boys' clothes,
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:53.600]  then you weren't doing a very good job parenting.
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:56.600]  Lots of spray and wash, that's the secret to that.
[03:00:56.600 --> 03:00:59.600]  And also, I feel bad because I think men are in,
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:00.600]  like I said, a tight spot.
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:02.600]  And also, I'm probably the biggest anti-feminist
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:04.600]  you'll ever meet on the planet.
[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:08.600]  And I think women have really ruined womanhood.
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:11.600]  And I think there's a lot to be said
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:14.600]  for really strong, really good women.
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:16.600]  And I really appreciate women,
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:19.600]  but I also appreciate men pretty equally, actually.
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:21.600]  You want to talk equal, okay?
[03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:24.600]  I would say that I equally appreciate both.
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:27.600]  And I think these horrendous women
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:30.600]  are kind of just trying to destroy men,
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:31.600]  but they're not going to
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:33.600]  because the vast majority of women in this country
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:37.600]  really understand that it takes both, both roles,
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:41.600]  and we need both to be strong and men to be strong.
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:42.600]  So I love that conversation.
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:45.600]  I also love that conversation for another reason, too.
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:48.600]  And it's talking about what they did with,
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:50.600]  I call it blowvid because of blows,
[03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:56.600]  but COVID, the whole masterminded idea of COVID.
[03:01:56.600 --> 03:01:59.600]  You know, it was funny, a friend of mine said recently
[03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:01.600]  that they took a COVID test.
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:05.600]  And I know this person knows what a farset is.
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:07.600]  But here's the deal, though.
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:10.600]  Many times on the show, since day one, right,
[03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:12.600]  on this show, on my show, whatever,
[03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:14.600]  I've said over and over again,
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:16.600]  the FDA, there is no COVID in the test.
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:19.600]  The FDA on the pamphlet that you can go look up online,
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:21.600]  there's a question in there and it says,
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:23.600]  will I get COVID from this test?
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:25.600]  And it says, there is no COVID in the test,
[03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:28.600]  but it's called a COVID test.
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:30.600]  Hmm, isn't that strange?
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:32.600]  Hmm, makes one wonder, doesn't it?
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:35.600]  You're not going, it's just a name.
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:38.600]  They could have named it Blobbitygook test
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:41.600]  and everyone would go, am I going to get Blobbitygook?
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:43.600]  It's that ridiculous.
[03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:46.600]  There is no COVID in the test and they admit it.
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:50.600]  The FDA admits it in writing on the very brochure
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:53.600]  they give you when you go take a test.
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:54.600]  So stop testing.
[03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:57.600]  What testing does is it furthers their lies.
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:00.600]  It furthers the whole scandemic.
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:05.600]  And the more we buy into it, even in the smallest way,
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:07.600]  it gives them power.
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:10.600]  And the only thing I want to do is take power away from them.
[03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:12.600]  So today I want to talk to you a little bit
[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:14.600]  of a different angle on the fires.
[03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:15.600]  I know you've heard a lot,
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:19.600]  they've covered fires so magnificently on this show
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:20.600]  and so many angles,
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:22.600]  but I want to bring in a new angle
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:25.600]  and something that is maybe not being talked about as much,
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:27.600]  but I observed found a little strange
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:30.600]  given all the history and research I do.
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:34.600]  So I want to talk about that in relation to property rights.
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:36.600]  And then I also want to give you a lot of things
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:39.600]  that you could probably do right now this summer
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:41.600]  to sort of prepare for what's coming.
[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:43.600]  We know the digital dollar is coming.
[03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:46.600]  We know we're going to wipe out cash.
[03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:48.600]  We know all these things are on the horizon.
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:51.600]  You can feel it. I can feel it.
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:53.600]  We all have that gut sense
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:56.600]  that there is a transition going on.
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:03:58.600]  I do not think we'll go into a depression.
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:01.600]  I think we're going into a transition.
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:03.600]  And that transition is going to be,
[03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:06.600]  if I say the word interesting, it doesn't do it justice.
[03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:08.600]  It's going to be hard,
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:10.600]  but it's also going to be something
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:13.600]  that I hope that we can kind of get a grasp on
[03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:15.600]  and maybe some control over for our own lives
[03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:16.600]  because that's the only way
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:17.600]  we're going to pull out of all of this
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:20.600]  if we pull out of all of this.
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:21.600]  And I do have a lot of hope in man.
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:24.600]  So when I come back, I want to give you a lot of things,
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:25.600]  and I also want to give you a prediction
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:28.600]  from 1991 in a book, okay?
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:30.600]  But that's when I come back.
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:31.600]  So we'll start with the fires,
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:33.600]  and I want to give you maybe a different angle
[03:04:33.600 --> 03:04:35.600]  on that to think about.
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:36.600]  I just reviewed the tape
[03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:38.600]  where people were trying to volunteer
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:40.600]  and, of course, couldn't get in anywhere.
[03:04:40.600 --> 03:04:41.600]  Kind of scary, isn't it?
[03:04:41.600 --> 03:04:44.600]  When government takes over, man, they really take over,
[03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:47.600]  and they sure did in this whole agenda.
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:49.600]  So I will be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:51.600]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:04:51.600 --> 03:04:53.600]  We have a lot to talk about today.
[03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:54.600]  It'll be good.
[03:04:55.300 --> 03:05:02.619]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated,
[03:05:02.619 --> 03:05:05.460]  high-quality bone broth there is.
[03:05:05.460 --> 03:05:10.660]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing, then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive
[03:05:10.660 --> 03:05:16.060]  dose of beef pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just
[03:05:16.060 --> 03:05:17.759]  gets crazier from there.
[03:05:17.759 --> 03:05:18.900]  It's about to sell out.
[03:05:18.900 --> 03:05:20.439]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[03:05:20.439 --> 03:05:22.400]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[03:05:56.160 --> 03:06:02.779]  out.
[03:06:02.779 --> 03:06:08.699]  Back here with you, Kate Dally, and I am hosting this hour for the Alex Jones show.
[03:06:08.699 --> 03:06:10.460]  So appreciate him.
[03:06:10.460 --> 03:06:11.859]  And let me just start out with this.
[03:06:11.859 --> 03:06:16.740]  I know you've probably heard this because I think to people's amazement, right?
[03:06:16.740 --> 03:06:22.539]  Fire and Fury, the story of 2023, Maui fire and its implications for climate change.
[03:06:22.539 --> 03:06:24.259]  Of course they had to put climate change in the title.
[03:06:24.259 --> 03:06:25.259]  Why wouldn't they?
[03:06:25.259 --> 03:06:28.939]  I mean, there's so many boneheads that are actually going to believe that.
[03:06:28.939 --> 03:06:33.539]  And so I'm calling this, you know, the fire that they're getting away with, truly.
[03:06:33.539 --> 03:06:37.980]  But isn't it interesting that this event was from the 8th to 11th, and this book
[03:06:37.980 --> 03:06:45.060]  is already out on Amazon by Miles, Miles, Miles stones.
[03:06:45.060 --> 03:06:46.060]  Interesting name.
[03:06:46.380 --> 03:06:49.619]  Fire and Fury, the story of 2023, Maui fire.
[03:06:49.619 --> 03:06:51.939]  You guys find that a little weird?
[03:06:51.939 --> 03:06:52.939]  Okay.
[03:06:52.939 --> 03:06:59.580]  And also, of course, the whole, well, the whole context of the book is climate change.
[03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:02.759]  And no lie, you can't make this crap up anymore.
[03:07:02.759 --> 03:07:07.580]  It's gripping an eye opening account of one of the most devastating wildfires in Hawaii's
[03:07:07.580 --> 03:07:13.619]  history and how it reveals the urgent need to address the global climate crisis.
[03:07:13.619 --> 03:07:15.900]  Notice how they're not really talking about the fires.
[03:07:15.900 --> 03:07:20.300]  They're just talking about the global climate crisis.
[03:07:20.300 --> 03:07:22.599]  I love that.
[03:07:22.599 --> 03:07:28.060]  So I was reviewing tapes on, of course, the bought and paid for governor of Hawaii talking
[03:07:28.060 --> 03:07:33.619]  about, and I know you've seen this tape, where he's talking immediately about the
[03:07:33.619 --> 03:07:38.619]  housing he wants to build and the new city he wants to build and how he is pretty much
[03:07:38.619 --> 03:07:42.240]  begging at this point for the state to buy up the land.
[03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:46.279]  People were posting about the insurance part of this.
[03:07:46.279 --> 03:07:50.400]  As far as that goes, how is anyone going to rebuild?
[03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:52.720]  They're going to have to give it to the insurance companies.
[03:07:52.720 --> 03:07:54.720]  The insurance companies aren't going to do anything.
[03:07:54.720 --> 03:07:56.800]  I've heard all kinds of things.
[03:07:56.800 --> 03:08:00.480]  They don't have enough money built in because the money is really about the land, not
[03:08:00.480 --> 03:08:03.660]  about the structure and all kinds of things.
[03:08:03.660 --> 03:08:09.420]  So there's a real defeatist thing going on where the messaging is the state will
[03:08:09.420 --> 03:08:14.960]  take your property whenever it wants and they're going to make it so.
[03:08:14.960 --> 03:08:17.920]  And so now you have to try to fight for your land.
[03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:22.980]  Whereas if your house burnt down today, okay, and I hope it doesn't, if your house
[03:08:22.980 --> 03:08:27.099]  burnt down today, you would go to your insurance company and you would rebuild the
[03:08:27.099 --> 03:08:28.099]  home.
[03:08:28.099 --> 03:08:29.099]  Okay.
[03:08:29.099 --> 03:08:30.099]  You would rebuild the home.
[03:08:30.099 --> 03:08:31.779]  The home is insured.
[03:08:31.779 --> 03:08:33.420]  So why aren't they talking about that?
[03:08:33.420 --> 03:08:34.420]  Right.
[03:08:34.420 --> 03:08:36.320]  It's very, very, very bizarre.
[03:08:36.320 --> 03:08:38.560]  So I was looking at a couple of things.
[03:08:38.560 --> 03:08:43.039]  And one of them, obviously, I just want to point out the most obvious things.
[03:08:43.039 --> 03:08:48.400]  The fire was hot enough to melt steel, but not hot enough to burn wood all around it.
[03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:54.039]  Gosh, that seems so reminiscent of almost, well, let's see, 22 years ago.
[03:08:54.039 --> 03:08:55.039]  Huh?
[03:08:55.039 --> 03:08:57.039]  Yeah, I remember that.
[03:08:57.039 --> 03:09:03.039]  Anyway, and the fire was strange and it's by the water and it's a very weird, it's
[03:09:03.039 --> 03:09:05.140]  not a wild brush fire.
[03:09:05.140 --> 03:09:10.099]  It was actually more or less the fire by the city, on the streets, and by certain buildings.
[03:09:10.099 --> 03:09:15.759]  I don't see any big resorts getting fire bombed.
[03:09:15.759 --> 03:09:20.900]  The governor comes out, the bought and paid for governor, and he talks, little Joshy,
[03:09:20.900 --> 03:09:24.019]  and he talks about how, oh my gosh, it was like a bomb, like a bomb exploded.
[03:09:24.019 --> 03:09:25.019]  I thought that was kind of interesting.
[03:09:25.019 --> 03:09:26.179]  It's a little bit of a tell.
[03:09:26.179 --> 03:09:27.320]  They always slip up.
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:31.160]  There's always those slip ups when they're describing things that sound a little off.
[03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:34.939]  Because usually when you're talking about a fire, you're not really going to be saying
[03:09:34.939 --> 03:09:35.939]  that.
[03:09:35.939 --> 03:09:36.939]  You're not going to say it looks like a bomb went off.
[03:09:36.939 --> 03:09:40.500]  You're just going to say, look what the fire did, okay?
[03:09:40.500 --> 03:09:44.420]  The trees around the area don't look really ravaged by a hurricane.
[03:09:44.420 --> 03:09:51.660]  We know that the feed was manipulated with space gaps, time gaps, I should say, and
[03:09:51.660 --> 03:09:53.699]  spaces within the video.
[03:09:53.699 --> 03:09:57.619]  We know that there's a lot of problems here with what we're visualizing and what we're
[03:09:57.619 --> 03:10:01.199]  shown in print, okay?
[03:10:01.199 --> 03:10:04.560]  And they're often doing black and white photos, which is really strange.
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:11.320]  But it seems as though this particular direct energy weapon, or did I say that out loud?
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:17.560]  Direct energy weapon seems to be pointed directly at certain types of homes and businesses,
[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:20.160]  not the resorts, okay?
[03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:24.199]  So now that we have established that, and I know that you, I know they've done great
[03:10:24.199 --> 03:10:25.539]  recaps here.
[03:10:25.539 --> 03:10:31.119]  I know Greg has done some great recaps and Alex and Owen, but here you go.
[03:10:31.119 --> 03:10:34.039]  You have this particular city.
[03:10:34.039 --> 03:10:35.039]  People can't get in.
[03:10:35.039 --> 03:10:36.039]  They cannot help.
[03:10:36.039 --> 03:10:38.519]  And there's a lot of really strange things.
[03:10:38.519 --> 03:10:40.840]  Then they talked about the banyan tree, okay?
[03:10:40.840 --> 03:10:43.240]  And then they said, well, maybe it's okay.
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:44.240]  Maybe it just burnt on the outside.
[03:10:44.240 --> 03:10:46.119]  I thought that was a little weird.
[03:10:46.119 --> 03:10:48.080]  But what were they doing inside the articles?
[03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:52.800]  They were saying over and over again how protected this area should be.
[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:58.679]  And they talked about the goddess of Maui and the pond there and all kinds of different
[03:10:58.679 --> 03:11:03.480]  elements to make you emotional about protection.
[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:09.359]  Oh, can the state, and so your next thought should be, as the governor is telling you,
[03:11:09.359 --> 03:11:13.039]  I want to protect this property, never happen again.
[03:11:13.039 --> 03:11:15.439]  I'm not specifically talking about the loss of life.
[03:11:15.439 --> 03:11:17.480]  We all know the loss of life is horribly sad.
[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:21.400]  The government, I think, cares less, could care less about the loss of life, but know
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:25.320]  that a lot of prayers are going up for these people that are caught in the crosshairs
[03:11:25.320 --> 03:11:27.080]  of whatever government does.
[03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:30.519]  And government does a lot of things, and they do not care about us.
[03:11:30.519 --> 03:11:38.080]  As evidenced in the 1950s and 60s on the reports of ways to basically kill us off
[03:11:38.080 --> 03:11:39.880]  and then blame it on other countries.
[03:11:39.880 --> 03:11:42.119]  So we have those reports, right?
[03:11:42.119 --> 03:11:44.560]  And those projects that are written out that we have access to.
[03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:46.279]  So I'm not just saying that.
[03:11:46.279 --> 03:11:47.900]  It's actually true.
[03:11:47.900 --> 03:11:49.960]  So here we are.
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:52.080]  I don't see the firefighting teams.
[03:11:52.080 --> 03:11:54.920]  I don't see the helicopters.
[03:11:54.920 --> 03:11:58.759]  It seems like in a lot of false flags, there's no helicopters.
[03:11:58.759 --> 03:12:01.400]  And I know that I've mentioned a few false flags here.
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:02.560]  There's no helicopters.
[03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:05.759]  There's no like things that you would see on the ground.
[03:12:05.759 --> 03:12:08.380]  Witnesses were saying, you know, there, there, there wasn't the alarms.
[03:12:08.380 --> 03:12:09.699]  There wasn't the firemen coming.
[03:12:09.699 --> 03:12:14.279]  It was a really strange scene and bizarre.
[03:12:14.279 --> 03:12:15.960]  Okay.
[03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:18.679]  And now I don't know if they're being honest about the death count.
[03:12:18.679 --> 03:12:22.320]  I don't know what's happening there, but let me tell you what happened yesterday.
[03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:27.640]  So yesterday, and this happened, I mean, my gosh, was it included in the book by milestones?
[03:12:27.640 --> 03:12:30.439]  I mean, my gosh, who gets out a book in a couple of days?
[03:12:30.439 --> 03:12:31.439]  I don't know.
[03:12:31.439 --> 03:12:36.000]  Who writes and gets it out and publishes a couple of days, but I'll go, I'll move forward.
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.279]  There were two articles that I thought were really strange.
[03:12:38.279 --> 03:12:40.679]  One from Reuters, which is bought and paid for.
[03:12:40.679 --> 03:12:45.800]  And they talked about Moody's investors serve investors service that estimated insurance
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:50.400]  losses from wildfires in Maui to about $1 billion.
[03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:54.640]  More than 2,000 structures were damaged, destroyed in 27 structures exposed.
[03:12:54.640 --> 03:12:55.640]  Okay.
[03:12:55.640 --> 03:12:57.840]  That was as of yesterday.
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:02.800]  What's interesting is it said the average single family home valued at 1.5 million estimated
[03:13:02.800 --> 03:13:08.560]  losses would affect property and casualty insurers with significant homeowners and commercial
[03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:10.679]  property market share.
[03:13:10.679 --> 03:13:11.679]  Okay.
[03:13:11.679 --> 03:13:16.920]  But we are talking about a smaller city on a smaller island.
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:21.759]  And as far as structures go, it's a lot of structures, but I wouldn't say it's going
[03:13:21.759 --> 03:13:25.900]  to change the industry forever, but this is the message you guys got, right?
[03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:29.359]  So this was the message they were trying to send yesterday.
[03:13:29.359 --> 03:13:34.119]  Then the New York Times did the other part of this setup and it said Maui fires
[03:13:34.119 --> 03:13:38.279]  come at a moment of turmoil for the insurance industry.
[03:13:38.279 --> 03:13:39.279]  That was the full title.
[03:13:39.279 --> 03:13:45.599]  New York Times, Maui fires come at a moment of turmoil for the insurance industry.
[03:13:45.599 --> 03:13:50.800]  Now before I talked about California and I talked about one insurer saying I'm not going
[03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:52.240]  to insure.
[03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:54.119]  Now what are they doing?
[03:13:54.119 --> 03:13:55.720]  Why are they saying this yesterday?
[03:13:55.720 --> 03:13:57.640]  Why are they concentrating on this?
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:01.580]  They said Hawaii has the nation's lowest rates for homeowner coverage because it has
[03:14:01.580 --> 03:14:04.199]  not suffered many natural disasters.
[03:14:04.199 --> 03:14:10.519]  Oh my gosh, they've had volcanoes, they've had a hurricane about 40 years ago, did some
[03:14:10.519 --> 03:14:11.560]  massive damage.
[03:14:11.560 --> 03:14:12.560]  What do you mean?
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:13.759]  What do you mean this is new?
[03:14:13.759 --> 03:14:14.759]  Okay.
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:20.320]  Insurers aren't really insuring that kind of low because there's not much happening
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:21.320]  over there.
[03:14:21.320 --> 03:14:22.320]  Give me a break.
[03:14:22.320 --> 03:14:23.320]  Give me a break.
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:24.320]  They're on an island.
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:25.320]  Okay.
[03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:27.980]  And so they talked about the devastating wildfires.
[03:14:27.980 --> 03:14:31.759]  This is New York Times and Hawaii have come at an upheaval for the insurance industry
[03:14:31.759 --> 03:14:36.279]  in a place that has not been considered very risky by underwriters.
[03:14:36.279 --> 03:14:37.279]  It's on the coast.
[03:14:37.279 --> 03:14:39.160]  It's risky.
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:41.000]  Why are they doing the article?
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.080]  They're doing the article for the big setup.
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:46.820]  What they're doing is they want to change the insurance industry.
[03:14:46.820 --> 03:14:49.519]  They want to stop funding homes.
[03:14:49.519 --> 03:14:51.640]  They want to stop funding loans.
[03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:57.320]  And I went back to like 2018 and 19 when people started claiming that certain homes
[03:14:57.320 --> 03:14:59.439]  were not getting funded by insurance companies.
[03:14:59.439 --> 03:15:01.920]  Do you guys notice something?
[03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:03.939]  The banks aren't talking about anything.
[03:15:03.939 --> 03:15:06.640]  You're not hearing one single word about the banks.
[03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:09.160]  You're only hearing about the insurance companies.
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:12.320]  Insurance this, insurance that, insurance companies won't pay.
[03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:16.759]  Then you've got a governor saying, oh, I think we have a plan already ready to do
[03:15:16.759 --> 03:15:19.320]  some housing here, workforce housing.
[03:15:19.320 --> 03:15:23.240]  And oh, by the way, I think the state should own this and maybe do a memorial.
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:26.119]  No, you have a fire you rebuild.
[03:15:26.119 --> 03:15:27.720]  This is easy stuff.
[03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:29.720]  This is not revolutionary.
[03:15:29.720 --> 03:15:31.279]  This is not new.
[03:15:31.279 --> 03:15:33.019]  Why are they talking this way?
[03:15:33.019 --> 03:15:38.019]  Why are they trying to convince everybody that insurance is in turmoil?
[03:15:38.019 --> 03:15:42.779]  So they're doing the setup for insurance being in turmoil is what they're doing.
[03:15:42.779 --> 03:15:47.720]  It's all propaganda to get you to believe that insuring a home is going to be extremely
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:51.259]  difficult in the future and that maybe only elites can do it.
[03:15:51.259 --> 03:15:52.259]  Interesting.
[03:15:52.259 --> 03:15:53.259]  I'll be right back for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:53.259 --> 03:15:56.820]  I'm Kate Dahlia, your host.
[03:15:56.820 --> 03:16:03.099]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:16:03.099 --> 03:16:04.220]  the atmosphere.
[03:16:04.220 --> 03:16:07.060]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:16:07.099 --> 03:16:13.420]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers, to convert these gases
[03:16:13.420 --> 03:16:17.859]  into fluorescence acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:16:17.859 --> 03:16:22.640]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:23.779]  dispose of it.
[03:16:23.779 --> 03:16:28.660]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the Treasury, who
[03:16:28.660 --> 03:16:32.179]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:16:32.179 --> 03:16:38.699]  And by 1950, the US government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:16:38.699 --> 03:16:41.080]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:16:41.080 --> 03:16:46.340]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:16:46.340 --> 03:16:51.300]  With the Alexa Peer Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this
[03:16:51.300 --> 03:16:52.300]  madness.

[03:17:05.460 --> 03:17:10.619]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[03:17:10.619 --> 03:17:11.619]  it.
[03:17:11.619 --> 03:17:16.420]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[03:17:16.420 --> 03:17:22.259]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:18.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:24.800]  So happy to be with you today. So these wildfires, really, you can't call them wildfires because
[03:20:24.800 --> 03:20:32.519]  they were really city fires. Not quite sure how that happens to you. Wink, wink. Anyways,
[03:20:32.519 --> 03:20:37.840]  was it a directed energy weapon? Well, in 2019, there was an article, I think it was
[03:20:37.840 --> 03:20:43.840]  Forbes, that said that the Pentagon wanted to use these sort of direct energy weapons
[03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:55.420]  by 2023. What year is it? Oh yeah. So was it that? There's been a lot about that. I'll
[03:20:55.420 --> 03:20:58.400]  get into that in just a moment. But the New York Times, the New York Times wrote
[03:20:58.400 --> 03:21:04.619]  this article, and this was yesterday, and they said this. They said, the devastating wildfires
[03:21:04.619 --> 03:21:10.179]  in Hawaii have come at a time in upheaval for the insurance industry in a place that
[03:21:10.179 --> 03:21:15.039]  has not been considered very risky by underwriters. I'm sorry, but I don't believe that for a
[03:21:15.039 --> 03:21:20.640]  second. They are pumping, pumping, pumping you, pumping you with propaganda that the
[03:21:20.640 --> 03:21:27.019]  insurance company has problems that you might not get. You can go buy a home, a very expensive
[03:21:27.019 --> 03:21:32.019]  home, but if you don't get it insured, you're not getting that house. Where have the banks
[03:21:32.019 --> 03:21:38.779]  been in all of this? Not a single solitary word. Yeah. It's really strange, but you know,
[03:21:38.779 --> 03:21:43.939]  if you understand who these guys are and what they do and who they control, then it
[03:21:43.939 --> 03:21:47.660]  makes a little more sense to tell you the truth. So what they kept saying was the
[03:21:47.660 --> 03:21:52.000]  state's residents have generally paid low home insurance rates, the cheapest in the country.
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:58.060]  I don't believe Hawaii would be the cheapest in the country. Okay. Anyway, but because
[03:21:58.060 --> 03:22:02.699]  there are relatively few natural disasters like Florida and California, you notice how
[03:22:02.699 --> 03:22:06.519]  they specifically mentioned those two states because those two states are the only states
[03:22:06.519 --> 03:22:11.080]  you've heard about, really, unless you're building a home in the mountains where there
[03:22:11.080 --> 03:22:16.500]  have been people that have said, I can't get it insured. But California and Florida
[03:22:16.500 --> 03:22:20.460]  seem to be the two places, right, that you're going to see the insurance company not
[03:22:20.460 --> 03:22:25.740]  across the country. So they're pumping you to make a problem a problem so that you think
[03:22:25.740 --> 03:22:29.599]  it's a problem, it becomes a problem, if that makes sense. And I know you probably
[03:22:29.599 --> 03:22:34.939]  are miles ahead of me. So what they said was this in this New York Times article
[03:22:34.939 --> 03:22:39.599]  yesterday, this is the focus. Remember that insurance rates are set on a state level
[03:22:39.599 --> 03:22:44.400]  with varying degrees of government regulation and intervention. And typically, states like
[03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:50.759]  Hawaii have strong private insurance markets. They haven't needed forceful state laws
[03:22:50.759 --> 03:22:59.480]  on rates. What should that say to you right there? What it says to me, and I research,
[03:22:59.480 --> 03:23:05.160]  I study probably eight, nine hours a day, actually, and I have for almost 13 years.
[03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:09.439]  Okay. So what that sentence says to me, and I'll say it again, typically states
[03:23:09.439 --> 03:23:15.160]  like Hawaii have strong private insurance markets have not needed forceful state involvement
[03:23:15.160 --> 03:23:25.960]  on rates yet. What happens if they do? What happens if people cannot, cannot get property?
[03:23:25.960 --> 03:23:31.400]  Only the elites can't hang on to property because of insurance rates, right? Because
[03:23:31.400 --> 03:23:36.640]  you have a contract with your home, but your insurance company can fluctuate, right,
[03:23:36.640 --> 03:23:41.960]  as you resign with them, you know, and in terms. Okay. And so do they have a little
[03:23:41.960 --> 03:23:46.279]  more control over your home than mortgages? Because I think when we think property rights,
[03:23:46.279 --> 03:23:52.019]  we always think, well, you know, we're bound in a mortgage. It's a contract. Okay.
[03:23:52.019 --> 03:23:56.679]  But the problem is, is that the insurance companies and the taxation, property taxation
[03:23:56.679 --> 03:24:00.720]  can throw big wrenches in property rights. And this is why they're talking about it
[03:24:00.720 --> 03:24:04.960]  right now. They're doing the setup right now. The setup for insurance is going to
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:10.439]  get a lot harder to get. Not because it was a real problem causing it. Anytime there's
[03:24:10.439 --> 03:24:14.960]  a disaster, you go in, you fund it. But I have to remind everybody, PG&E got brought
[03:24:14.960 --> 03:24:21.759]  up on charges, right? For manslaughter, for arson, for those fires in 2020. Don't
[03:24:21.759 --> 03:24:30.800]  forget that. PG&E. So do we know that government in some shape or form could cause these things?
[03:24:30.800 --> 03:24:36.840]  Sure we do. Yeah. It's evidenced, it's witnessed. And also, this is what David
[03:24:36.840 --> 03:24:42.119]  Martlet said, professor at Appalachian State University. Is there, anyway, I think insurance
[03:24:42.119 --> 03:24:47.400]  or insurance, insurers, I'm sorry, are going to start factoring in the increased
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:53.359]  frequency and severity of wildfires. You've already seen that in California. We may
[03:24:53.359 --> 03:24:57.960]  see that across the board. Are we looking at more fire bombings from direct energy
[03:24:57.960 --> 03:25:04.779]  weapons? Hmm. Is this a reason that they can sort of tilt the insurance company into
[03:25:04.779 --> 03:25:12.320]  this whole problematic industry now? Right? Uber expensive industry that outprices everybody
[03:25:12.320 --> 03:25:16.720]  out of a home. So let me kind of give you a big picture on this because I always
[03:25:16.720 --> 03:25:21.279]  like big picture. The big picture on this would be to understand the insurance companies
[03:25:21.279 --> 03:25:26.679]  for just a moment. Edward, and this came from a Dr. David Martin. Edward Jenner,
[03:25:26.679 --> 03:25:32.960]  in the late 1700s, I think it was 1794 and 96, invented the vaccine, okay? Which,
[03:25:32.960 --> 03:25:38.400]  by the way, it's the, it gets its variation from cattle. We're the cattle. Anyway,
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:44.119]  Jenner decided that there should be an opportunity, right? And you could play around with the
[03:25:44.119 --> 03:25:49.560]  weaponization of nature. And in 1803, a conversation started right after that,
[03:25:49.880 --> 03:25:55.720]  at the inception of our country, right after, with how to use the plague to possibly our advantage,
[03:25:55.720 --> 03:25:59.880]  or their advantage, I'm sorry, not our advantage. Plagues are like bacteria caused,
[03:25:59.880 --> 03:26:04.080]  and that's why they spread, okay? So you have a situation where they were setting up,
[03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:09.920]  hey, we have these shots and hey, we have these plagues from the past. What could we do
[03:26:09.920 --> 03:26:16.320]  with them? In 1883, 80 years later, Francis Galton came up with an answer to that and
[03:26:16.359 --> 03:26:22.039]  said these beautiful things called bacteria, all of these things, this weaponization of nature,
[03:26:22.039 --> 03:26:25.640]  would start the eugenics program, okay? Kind of like a business plan, if you will.
[03:26:25.640 --> 03:26:31.599]  It included the insurance companies, and this is where the insurance companies were sort of
[03:26:31.599 --> 03:26:38.960]  really born and then gave us a whole new surge in the GDP at the time. And this was 1893 to
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:46.640]  18, or 1883 to 93, that 10 years, okay? The insurance companies took hold, and I don't think
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:52.240]  we realize the overall impact this has on our society. No one ever talks about insurance
[03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:56.960]  companies. In fact, they did not talk about them for the last three years, okay? The payouts,
[03:26:56.960 --> 03:27:02.359]  the things, and I talked about it, I think the last time I was on here, I talked about the fact
[03:27:02.359 --> 03:27:07.880]  that the numbers were insane. The numbers were through the roof for payouts in 21 and 22,
[03:27:07.920 --> 03:27:13.920]  not necessarily 2020, when supposedly COVID was ravaging the earth. Give me a break. What a lie.
[03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:19.960]  Such a lie. It was a label, you guys, and I know you know that. So the insurance companies
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:26.759]  crop up, and in 1904, who was on that platform, that dais, when the president came into being
[03:27:26.759 --> 03:27:35.279]  in 1905 and from then on? And we're talking from the early 1900s, you had the fully owned
[03:27:35.359 --> 03:27:39.400]  presidents, like with Colonel House in the background, kind of directing things at the
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:46.259]  beginning. You had all of these shadowy figures, right, of the deep state really going to bat
[03:27:46.259 --> 03:27:53.720]  starting in the early 1900s. And who was on that platform with the president of the United
[03:27:53.720 --> 03:27:59.679]  States to kind of say, here we are, and we're in control because of the eugenics program that
[03:27:59.679 --> 03:28:05.080]  was started through the use of vaccines. And it was New York Life and Aetna and the insurance
[03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:10.080]  companies of America. The insurance companies, by the way, they're still going strong. Isn't it
[03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:16.640]  interesting? They hardly ever fail. Your big ones? Yep, just keep on chugging the lawn. Do they
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:22.759]  control the banks? We always think the banks, the banks are the banks, but is there a lot of
[03:28:22.759 --> 03:28:29.480]  control coming from the insurance companies? And Dr. David Martin made the assertion that they
[03:28:29.480 --> 03:28:34.279]  actually rule much of what's going on, but they do it so quietly and so behind the scenes.
[03:28:35.080 --> 03:28:42.759]  Right? But when they could game death in eugenics, when they could game death, there was just a hell
[03:28:42.759 --> 03:28:49.400]  of a lot of money to be, to be had. And that's been the problem for the last well over a century
[03:28:49.400 --> 03:28:55.560]  now. Right? Insane. Two centuries. Be right back for the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally.

[03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:16.720]  Welcome back, back here with you on the Alex Jones show. Happy to be with you today. I'm
[03:33:16.720 --> 03:33:21.980]  Kate Dally, your guest host for the hour. And just talking a little bit about the insurance
[03:33:21.980 --> 03:33:27.119]  companies. Yeah, it makes me sick. It really does. It makes me sick because there's been
[03:33:27.119 --> 03:33:32.359]  such a big power play going on. You know, they rushed the Federal Reserve to happen
[03:33:32.359 --> 03:33:37.960]  right before World War One. But I don't think many people realize that they actually insured
[03:33:37.960 --> 03:33:42.599]  the soldiers for the first time. Do you realize that? Most families didn't even know they
[03:33:42.599 --> 03:33:49.880]  were insured and never picked up the benefits of a lost loved one. But yeah, they sure made
[03:33:49.880 --> 03:33:56.640]  out on that too. And what happened in World War One was the vaccination program, kind
[03:33:56.640 --> 03:34:01.439]  of that trial run to make it look like we had this big disease. When I went back
[03:34:02.080 --> 03:34:08.439]  in the archives on that, you know, that was like 13 page news. It wasn't even cover news at the
[03:34:08.439 --> 03:34:14.840]  time. And I told you in previous episodes that they bumped the numbers up every year. So what
[03:34:14.840 --> 03:34:20.720]  was very, very low now is 50 to 100 million people died from that. But they used that in
[03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:26.119]  many ways. Number one, to pump up numbers. Number two, they insured the soldiers. They made
[03:34:26.119 --> 03:34:32.759]  money that way. But once the insurance companies got into effect, once they sort of took hold,
[03:34:32.759 --> 03:34:38.480]  isn't it interesting? It was right before you had the banking taken over,
[03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:47.320]  central banking put in place. You had the wars. You had very manipulated wars. All kinds
[03:34:47.320 --> 03:34:54.160]  of things transpired. The move into socialism, all kinds of things from that time on. Very,
[03:34:54.160 --> 03:34:59.400]  very strange. But what's the purpose? What's the coverage about? The coverage is supposed to make
[03:34:59.400 --> 03:35:06.000]  you feel like the government can take your land with eminent domain and that you have no say.
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:11.320]  And that whatever the government decides to do, if they want to do a memorial in Maui and then
[03:35:11.320 --> 03:35:15.439]  put up government housing, that they're going to do it. And now you have to try to fight
[03:35:15.439 --> 03:35:20.640]  for your property rights. You shouldn't have to fight for your property rights. You're
[03:35:20.640 --> 03:35:25.480]  insured, heavily insured. Build it back and don't let them take over. And I know the people
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:32.720]  of Maui, well, hopefully they'll band together and won't let that happen. And it's really a
[03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:36.960]  pitiful circumstance because the people are caught in the crosshairs. And those are the true
[03:35:36.960 --> 03:35:42.119]  victims. There's all kinds of false flags for different reasons. Some events don't happen. Some
[03:35:42.119 --> 03:35:47.800]  events do and all used by the government for whatever purpose they want to use that for.
[03:35:47.800 --> 03:35:54.640]  And so in this one, people were victimized. And that's the hard part about that to have to
[03:35:54.640 --> 03:35:59.679]  think about is the sad part of the loss of life because I think the government doesn't really
[03:35:59.679 --> 03:36:06.439]  care. And that's an understatement of the century, is it not? Okay, so I wanted to say
[03:36:06.439 --> 03:36:12.000]  two things. Well, more than two things, but I'll start with this. The CDC two days ago came out
[03:36:12.160 --> 03:36:18.080]  with the recommendation that all babies under eight months old entering the first RSV season
[03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:25.519]  receive a newly improved injection called Bay Fortis. And children up to 19 months are
[03:36:25.519 --> 03:36:32.199]  considered vulnerable to severe RSV. Do you know how rare severe RSV is? Do you know it's been
[03:36:32.199 --> 03:36:37.359]  around for a really long time? And guess what, folks? We survive. Yeah, it's called a cold.
[03:36:38.160 --> 03:36:43.840]  And yes, some babies in America will get that cold worse than others, right? Maybe it's from
[03:36:43.840 --> 03:36:48.960]  the other shots they were given before that. Who knows that weakened their immune system. But
[03:36:48.960 --> 03:36:55.199]  please stop giving any babies these shots and injections. Please say no. We need a t shirt.
[03:36:55.199 --> 03:37:03.519]  We need a t shirt. Alex says no more shots. Say no to any buddy with a needle, please.
[03:37:04.320 --> 03:37:10.640]  Um, they had just come out with the new rest art, you know, the the new shot error,
[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:16.960]  a Rex V, a Rex V, um, Eric's view, however, I'm the name murderer. So a Rex V, I think is what
[03:37:16.960 --> 03:37:23.119]  it is. And it was approved for lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. And that was in May.
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:31.039]  You guys, we don't it's a it's a cold. We don't need any shots. We don't need any shots.
[03:37:31.119 --> 03:37:36.960]  It's getting to the point where no matter what it is, hang now. Here's a shot. Right? Um,
[03:37:36.960 --> 03:37:44.080]  you got bunions. Here's a shot. Ah, saying yes to their injections. Why do they want to put
[03:37:44.080 --> 03:37:50.960]  a needle in you every single time you turn around? Why are they so insistent on every single
[03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:59.519]  thing is fixed with a government approved FDA ridiculous approved shot. You want to go
[03:37:59.519 --> 03:38:04.720]  stick a needle in your baby? Let the baby grow up and let the baby decide for themselves
[03:38:04.720 --> 03:38:10.240]  whether or not they want to get shot up with 90 shots. Please, please stop getting these shots.
[03:38:10.800 --> 03:38:15.359]  Oh my gosh, they're scaring these poor little parents. And it's the saddest thing I've
[03:38:15.359 --> 03:38:19.119]  seen because it's they're scaring them and they're saying you're not a good parent if you
[03:38:19.119 --> 03:38:24.640]  don't go do these things. All you're doing is weakening that baby's immune system horribly,
[03:38:24.640 --> 03:38:30.080]  if not death or autism or maiming or all the other things that can occur too.
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:37.279]  Please. Um, so we have this triple demic coming up. And one thing I would say to everybody is
[03:38:38.160 --> 03:38:44.080]  if you have a loved one in a nursing home, if you have a loved one that is in a facility
[03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:49.439]  where Medicaid, is it Medicaid or Medicare? I always get confused, but the one for older
[03:38:49.439 --> 03:38:54.880]  people, I always forget which one it is. Anyway, if it's controlled by that
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:02.240]  and they declare whatever new globity gook variant from hell, they want to come up with
[03:39:02.240 --> 03:39:07.519]  Trojan horse variant. Okay. They're coming up with a meat every single month. Nobody cares,
[03:39:07.519 --> 03:39:11.199]  but there's, they're still coming up with them. But if they actually try to make it look
[03:39:11.199 --> 03:39:16.960]  like it's real and do something with it, your loved one will be locked down quicker than
[03:39:16.960 --> 03:39:22.240]  anything. So that shot that I just mentioned is for older people and babies.
[03:39:23.679 --> 03:39:27.599]  Please don't give it to older people too, please. But, but make sure your paperwork,
[03:39:27.599 --> 03:39:33.039]  make sure that you get to an attorney, make sure that you are in control as much as you
[03:39:33.039 --> 03:39:38.480]  can possibly be or move them to a facility where you do have control. And if you can't get
[03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:44.720]  your loved one out, I think one of the best ideas you can do is to, is if that happened
[03:39:44.720 --> 03:39:50.080]  and your loved one was locked into a facility and you can't get to them because of government
[03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:55.359]  and all the workers, the little brown shirted workers are going along with the, with the ideas
[03:39:55.359 --> 03:39:58.720]  that they have to do whatever the state tells them to do because they don't have an American
[03:39:58.720 --> 03:40:05.519]  bone in their body. Well, get them out on hospice, get them out on hospice, do something
[03:40:05.519 --> 03:40:13.039]  else, get them out of that situation because they have, they think the right to give them
[03:40:13.039 --> 03:40:17.920]  whatever shots and to do whatever they want to them and keep them isolated. And I don't want
[03:40:17.920 --> 03:40:22.480]  to see that happen again. I really fear for people right now because you know something else
[03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:26.880]  is coming or Pfizer wouldn't be trying to pay off all the governors trying to get,
[03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:31.920]  trying to get Pfizer plants, more Pfizer plants. And you know, they're working in their states
[03:40:31.920 --> 03:40:36.640]  and you know, they're working on more shots and you know, they have at least three to 400
[03:40:36.640 --> 03:40:43.759]  shots right now ready to go to pimp to you by using all of mainstream media to pimp Pfizer
[03:40:43.759 --> 03:40:50.000]  commercials and whatnot. So you know more is coming and whether it's faked like the whole
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:55.599]  blow vid thing or whether they, maybe some people actually, they do something to a few
[03:40:55.599 --> 03:41:00.240]  people and everybody thinks it's coming for them. Whatever the case may be, please secure
[03:41:00.240 --> 03:41:04.000]  your loved one, your precious mother, your precious father, your precious loved one.
[03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:07.599]  Make sure that they're okay. And right now is a really good time to do that.
[03:41:07.599 --> 03:41:14.000]  Just like right now is a really good time to have a plan. If stuff hits the fan, if
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:17.679]  something happens, put a plan into motion. This is a great time to do it. It's a great
[03:41:17.679 --> 03:41:23.679]  time to do food storage. It's a great time to bulk up on supplements and also get a
[03:41:25.199 --> 03:41:30.240]  breathing machine, a respiratory machine so that if something happened and they did use
[03:41:30.240 --> 03:41:36.400]  respiratory, they're about two, 300 bucks and you need one for your home and you could
[03:41:36.400 --> 03:41:40.400]  actually go in with it with other family members and friends so that you have one
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:44.400]  that can be shared, you know, because not everybody's sick at once, right? But if that
[03:41:44.400 --> 03:41:48.400]  were to happen and somebody in your family fell ill, the last place I'd want to go to is
[03:41:49.679 --> 03:41:55.119]  a government controlled hospital, which is basically all the hospitals now. So have that
[03:41:55.119 --> 03:41:59.279]  apparatus right now. Don't wait until the fall or winter when you can't get one or when
[03:41:59.279 --> 03:42:03.759]  they're sold out. Get it right now and get ahead on prescriptions, right? Get ahead on
[03:42:03.759 --> 03:42:08.240]  prescriptions right now. Make sure you have some ivermectin. Make sure you have some
[03:42:08.240 --> 03:42:13.920]  budesonide. That's the steroid, right? These are wonderful things that you need to
[03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:17.840]  have in your arsenal and right now is a good time because nobody's thinking about it. You
[03:42:17.840 --> 03:42:22.000]  know what they're thinking about? Vacation and back to school, okay? So where the
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  nation is kind of fixed on the whole back to school thing, they're not getting these
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:31.279]  things and there are a lot of really good, there are some, I shouldn't say a lot, there's not a lot,
[03:42:31.279 --> 03:42:35.279]  there's only some really good thinking doctors in America left. I think Dr. Artis said there's
[03:42:35.279 --> 03:42:40.560]  like 600 really good doctors left in the nation. Find one and get some scripts ahead
[03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:44.640]  of some things you can keep in your house. I mean, the pandemic office at the White House
[03:42:44.640 --> 03:42:50.320]  opened up for business. Well, if you open up a business, if you open up an office at the
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:56.640]  White House, you got to have something to do. All right, you're right back on the Alex Jones show.
[03:42:56.640 --> 03:43:01.199]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality coffee
[03:43:01.199 --> 03:43:05.599]  has not been available and that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and
[03:43:05.599 --> 03:43:10.240]  the quality had gone down some. I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us
[03:43:10.240 --> 03:43:17.039]  but now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier

[03:46:06.640 --> 03:46:12.640]  authorized companies and industry to use. One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:16.640]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is
[03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:22.880]  enough to sterilize you and basically turn your sun into a feminized mutant. Look it up.

[03:47:05.199 --> 03:47:06.420]  you
[03:47:06.200 --> 03:47:17.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[03:47:17.200 --> 03:47:24.120]  So glad to be with you. I know I don't bring great news, right? But you know, it's good
[03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:28.200]  to be awake because you can't fight all this if you're not awake. And then I think our
[03:47:28.200 --> 03:47:34.720]  biggest challenge is going to be to help our friends, our kids, our grandkids really
[03:47:34.720 --> 03:47:39.320]  in particular, see what's coming and understand what's ahead of them, because that's kind
[03:47:39.320 --> 03:47:43.560]  of the more scary part of this. And I know all of you worry about that is, you know,
[03:47:43.560 --> 03:47:47.720]  you're, you've had your, you know, this life, but what about them? And what are they
[03:47:47.720 --> 03:47:51.720]  going to have to contend with? It's interesting to have a crystal ball. And I talked about
[03:47:51.720 --> 03:47:56.420]  the fact that the White House opened up their pandemic office. I know you know this,
[03:47:56.420 --> 03:48:02.280]  and just recently. So of course they have to have something to do and open up an
[03:48:02.280 --> 03:48:10.120]  office and just sit there. Okay. So that world of hurts coming for us. And I just hope
[03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:15.400]  we can see through it this time. Now that we have wizened up. Okay. Many, many people
[03:48:15.400 --> 03:48:19.640]  have, man, the first week of blow that I got so much hate mail. I just said, you
[03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:27.520]  don't get it. We're all going to die. Anyway, people weren't dying of COVID. They just
[03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:35.080]  weren't, they were dying from ICUs. Okay. So there's another crystal ball. And I don't
[03:48:35.080 --> 03:48:40.000]  know if I mentioned this before on the show. Strauss and Howe, who did the fourth turning,
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:44.680]  everybody talks about that, right? The fourth turning. And yeah, they could have nailed that
[03:48:44.680 --> 03:48:49.240]  as far as the turnings go and discussing the phases of life that we go through. They did
[03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:54.040]  a book about generations. So it was called Generations, a History of America's Future.
[03:48:54.640 --> 03:49:05.920]  And it was 1584 to 2069. Okay, secure number. 2069, not a round number, but whatever. So this
[03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:11.120]  was this book was written by them Strauss and Howe in 1991. And it discusses the history of
[03:49:11.120 --> 03:49:17.760]  the United States as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584. So in the fourth
[03:49:17.760 --> 03:49:23.200]  turning, they talk about, you know, the fourfold cycle of generational types and moods and things
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:30.800]  like that. And then they wrote this piece in this 1991 book. So let me just share this
[03:49:30.800 --> 03:49:38.720]  with you one more time. And I really was going to share it. Where is it? Okay, here
[03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:45.800]  we go. All right. So this is what they wrote. They said, this is page 15 of this
[03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:51.800]  book Generations, the History of America's Future. Okay. Page 15, Prelude. It says,
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:58.680]  No one, for example, can foretell the specific emergency that will confront America during
[03:49:58.680 --> 03:50:05.280]  what we call the crisis of 2020. Nor, of course, the exact year in which this crisis
[03:50:05.280 --> 03:50:10.400]  could find its epicenter. What we do claim our cycle can predict is that during the
[03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:20.520]  late 2010s and early 2020s, American generations will pass deep into a crisis era, constellation
[03:50:20.520 --> 03:50:26.920]  and mood. And that, as a consequence, the nation's public life will undergo a swift
[03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:36.400]  and possibly revolutionary transformation. With what's coming next week as far as announcements
[03:50:36.400 --> 03:50:45.040]  from BRICS, the digital ruble, the digital currency, the obvious, you can just see how
[03:50:45.040 --> 03:50:51.200]  it's kind of rolling forward, can't you? This will be a transition. It'll be a transition.
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:56.880]  They'll try to make it look really good before the 2024 election so that everything
[03:50:56.880 --> 03:51:03.160]  can look nice and beautiful, painting lipstick on a pig. And then 2025, we're going to
[03:51:03.160 --> 03:51:08.320]  go into hurt mode again, I do believe. But it's kind of the cycles in which the
[03:51:08.320 --> 03:51:12.880]  government works and how they like to game things. This is what we were talking about
[03:51:12.880 --> 03:51:18.560]  in the beginning, gaming death, okay? And being able to create weapons and things that
[03:51:18.560 --> 03:51:23.600]  look like it causes natural disasters, as promised in Project Bluebeam. It was all
[03:51:23.600 --> 03:51:31.660]  about using technology, AI, and creating earthquakes and creating natural disasters
[03:51:31.660 --> 03:51:37.200]  that look really natural, but they're not. So who benefits? Well, the government gobbles
[03:51:37.200 --> 03:51:41.340]  up land. It's a land grab, of course you realize it. And then also the insurance
[03:51:41.340 --> 03:51:47.100]  company games it. And then, of course, by screwing with the insurance company, then
[03:51:47.100 --> 03:51:52.940]  everyone goes, well, they can sort of accept that more as a reason that they can't
[03:51:52.940 --> 03:51:59.920]  get a house. Because you know natural occurrences, wildfires, things like that, right? Instead
[03:51:59.920 --> 03:52:04.480]  of a bank just saying no to you for no apparent reason, right? Because now they're
[03:52:04.480 --> 03:52:10.580]  all into this equity and everyone should get a loan and the middle class of America should
[03:52:10.580 --> 03:52:14.340]  pay for poor people to get loans and they shouldn't have stringent things against
[03:52:14.340 --> 03:52:18.660]  their loans and that's going to get really messy. But if you start really screwing with
[03:52:18.660 --> 03:52:23.580]  the insurance, it's going to get hard to get anything insured, okay? And so when
[03:52:23.580 --> 03:52:28.820]  they were talking about this crisis of 2020, it's amazing what their own crystal ball
[03:52:28.820 --> 03:52:33.780]  looked like, right? And who is Neil Howe anyway? Do you ever wonder about that?
[03:52:33.780 --> 03:52:38.620]  How were they able to write all of this? He has a really curious history. He worked
[03:52:38.620 --> 03:52:44.100]  in Washington, D.C., Neil Howe of Straus & Howe, as a public policy consultant on
[03:52:44.100 --> 03:52:49.680]  global aging, long-term fiscal policy and migration. His positions included advisor
[03:52:49.680 --> 03:52:52.020]  to public policy to the Blackstone Group.
[03:52:52.100 --> 03:53:01.000]  Hmm. The Blackstone Group. Blackstone, Blackrock, same thing. Really and truly. I actually just
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:05.180]  read an article where they actually wanted to screw up the name so that everyone would
[03:53:05.180 --> 03:53:12.820]  be confused. Blackstone, Blackrock. Same people behind all of it. And he was a policy
[03:53:12.820 --> 03:53:18.860]  advisor to the Concord Coalition and the Senior Associate for Global Aging Initiative
[03:53:18.860 --> 03:53:28.980]  for the Center of Strategic and International Studies. Gosh, it's like globalists. Hmm. Yeah.
[03:53:28.980 --> 03:53:33.540]  So a globalist and a globalist get together and write out the patterns and write out the
[03:53:33.540 --> 03:53:38.760]  things coming. Do you think these are well-laid plans? We're not so much of a conspiracy
[03:53:38.760 --> 03:53:43.700]  theorist, are we? We're more of people that just understand what plans look like,
[03:53:43.700 --> 03:53:49.220]  can read a plan, can understand a plan, and nothing is chalked up to coincidence. That's
[03:53:49.220 --> 03:53:54.620]  how it works. Nothing. So don't ever chalk anything up to coincidence. The coincidence
[03:53:54.620 --> 03:54:01.500]  theorists out there love that, by the way. They just love it. That's merely a coincidence.
[03:54:01.500 --> 03:54:05.020]  The government talking about housing projects that they would like to put on that property
[03:54:05.020 --> 03:54:09.340]  just days after it happened, they didn't even have a meeting. They didn't, did they
[03:54:09.340 --> 03:54:15.820]  even get a Zoom call in? In Maui? Really? The plan's already there? They're already
[03:54:15.820 --> 03:54:25.620]  talking that way? Please. Land grab. So this is important, I would definitely say, getting
[03:54:25.620 --> 03:54:28.940]  prepared for this. But you know, you hear that a lot. I know you guys hear getting
[03:54:28.940 --> 03:54:36.280]  prepared all the time. But if your bank account was to close tomorrow, are you okay?
[03:54:36.280 --> 03:54:40.760]  All of these things. Do you guys know, I didn't mention this, but in that RSV shot, do you
[03:54:40.760 --> 03:54:47.980]  know in the trial, 22 people died in the trial? Do they care? No, they don't care.
[03:54:47.980 --> 03:54:53.880]  Children aren't peeling off from RSV every single day in mass quantities. But 22 people
[03:54:53.880 --> 03:54:59.960]  did die in the trial for the RSV shot. Hmm. What should that tell you? It tells
[03:54:59.960 --> 03:55:05.180]  me that insurance companies are behind more than we think. It tells us that we want
[03:55:05.180 --> 03:55:09.620]  to have a defeatist attitude. They want us to have a defeatist attitude as far as
[03:55:09.620 --> 03:55:15.300]  do not protest, okay? Don't protest. Don't protest. You might be hauled into jail forever
[03:55:15.300 --> 03:55:19.660]  by the government. Don't protest. That's what, that's the message they're sending.
[03:55:19.660 --> 03:55:23.700]  And then of course the other message is you have to fight for your property rights.
[03:55:23.700 --> 03:55:26.740]  Well, wait a minute. What if you have a mortgage and you have an insurance company
[03:55:26.740 --> 03:55:32.820]  that is bound to pay? What's the problem here? Half of America didn't burn down.
[03:55:32.820 --> 03:55:37.700]  Why do you have to fight for your property rights? There should be absolutely no discussion
[03:55:37.700 --> 03:55:40.920]  like that. The only discussion is, when are you going to send me a check, insurance
[03:55:40.920 --> 03:55:46.040]  company? Been paying the bill. So why all the news coverage about what a fight it's
[03:55:46.040 --> 03:55:51.440]  going to be? It's not a fight. Don't make it into a fight. That's what's so important
[03:55:51.440 --> 03:55:55.780]  about this. That's how the propaganda works. It gets us to believe that all these things
[03:55:55.780 --> 03:56:03.500]  are true, okay? And I know people are in the, I'll spend two minutes on voting.
[03:56:03.500 --> 03:56:08.100]  People are into primaries right now and everybody, I would have to say your local elections
[03:56:08.100 --> 03:56:11.100]  are way more important than who wins the presidency and then who's the figurehead
[03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:16.780]  of the president in 2024. Who you put on those city councils? Who you put on those
[03:56:16.780 --> 03:56:21.420]  in those county commissioner positions? 3,000 counties in America. You want to save the
[03:56:21.420 --> 03:56:27.620]  country? You save the counties. So the COVID bucks got spread around to all the counties
[03:56:27.620 --> 03:56:32.980]  in America through the states and they really wanted them to go on a spending spree and
[03:56:32.980 --> 03:56:36.980]  use all that money. Why? Because it created ties and relationships and they're bound
[03:56:36.980 --> 03:56:41.780]  to the state. This is why you don't see city sovereignty a lot. They have it, they
[03:56:41.780 --> 03:56:47.980]  don't utilize it. When you're voting for somebody, stop looking at the buzzwords.
[03:56:48.540 --> 03:56:52.540]  You got to save America, it's broken, I'm here to fix it, I want to balance the budget.
[03:56:52.540 --> 03:56:56.340]  No. Do they have a backbone? Are they okay with being threatened with their life and
[03:56:56.340 --> 03:57:01.860]  their family's life? Will they stand up no matter what the cost, okay? And do they
[03:57:01.860 --> 03:57:05.580]  understand liberty and do they understand the constitution? Those are the questions
[03:57:05.580 --> 03:57:10.580]  you have to ask. And if they can't answer that and they give you this really weird,
[03:57:10.580 --> 03:57:16.980]  you know, answer, you know, they kind of look muddled, right? They're not the person.
[03:57:16.980 --> 03:57:20.820]  There's a lot of globalists vying for office right now. There's a lot of, like, pat you
[03:57:20.820 --> 03:57:25.380]  on the head and do what you're told kind of people. Don't go for that. Make sure
[03:57:25.380 --> 03:57:28.540]  they have a backbone and some courage. It's going to take a lot of courage to stand
[03:57:28.540 --> 03:57:32.260]  up to the rest of the globalists on every city council and county commissioners in
[03:57:32.260 --> 03:57:37.500]  this country right now to save our country. I'm Kate Dally for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:37.500 --> 03:57:41.540]  Sure enjoyed spending some time with you. Wish it was better news, but you know what?
[03:57:41.540 --> 03:57:45.100]  There's still a fight on and we can still do it. And you know what? We're stronger
[03:57:45.100 --> 03:57:47.340]  than them and we're, we outnumber them.
[03:57:47.340 --> 03:57:51.740]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the
[03:57:51.740 --> 03:57:56.540]  answer. I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum of CBD oil, the incredible
[03:57:56.540 --> 03:58:01.980]  things it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system for your
[03:58:01.980 --> 03:58:06.780]  nervous system particularly. Everybody knows it's incredible. It works. We have the strongest,
[03:58:06.780 --> 03:58:11.460]  best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price. Yes, you can find

[03:58:18.140 --> 03:58:25.540]  in central Texas. Our private label name is Rebel Zen. Rebel Zen is a private label
[03:58:25.540 --> 03:58:30.380]  of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country. It's based right here in Texas
[03:58:30.380 --> 03:58:34.540]  and we're giving it to you at 30% off. And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of
[03:58:34.540 --> 03:58:38.420]  what they're selling it for. They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors
[03:58:38.420 --> 03:58:42.860]  are. So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price, not even a lower price.
[03:58:42.860 --> 03:58:46.340]  Rebels in, get yours at mfullwarstore.com now.
[03:58:46.340 --> 03:58:52.220]  I talk a lot about the great successes Mfull Wars has had. I don't think anybody
[03:58:52.220 --> 03:58:58.100]  can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about
[03:58:58.100 --> 03:59:01.540]  the crew at Mfull Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:59:01.540 --> 03:59:07.900]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and
[03:59:07.900 --> 03:59:12.420]  Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:59:12.420 --> 03:59:16.940]  It's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole Mfull Wars crew,
[03:59:16.940 --> 03:59:20.500]  I thank you for your past support. And I want to encourage you now to realize that
[03:59:20.500 --> 03:59:25.900]  Mfull Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know
[03:59:25.900 --> 03:59:30.020]  you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never
[03:59:30.020 --> 03:59:34.340]  go to mfullwarstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[03:59:34.340 --> 03:59:38.620]  while at the same time keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[03:59:38.620 --> 03:59:43.340]  actually go buy products at mfullwarstore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went
[03:59:43.340 --> 03:59:46.820]  to mfullwarstore.com, our fighting problems will be over. Please take action now.
[03:59:46.820 --> 03:59:54.340]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
