[00:00.000 --> 00:28.120]  Mr. Olsen, on July 28, 2020, you signed a public letter attacking the Trump administration
[00:28.120 --> 00:33.720]  for using Department of Homeland Security officers to help protect the federal courthouse
[00:33.720 --> 00:35.800]  in Portland from violent rioters.
[00:35.800 --> 00:42.580]  That letter stated, quote, plainclothes officers in unmarked vehicles should be used only in
[00:42.580 --> 00:46.880]  limited capacities in clearly identified circumstances.
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.960]  Crowd control is not among those circumstances.
[00:50.960 --> 00:57.520]  Mr. Olsen, on January 6, 2021, did the Department of Justice or FBI have any plainclothes officers
[00:57.520 --> 00:59.520]  among the crowd at the Capitol?
[00:59.520 --> 01:09.080]  Senator, I'm not aware of whether or not there were plainclothes officers among the
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.640]  crowd at the Capitol on July 6.
[01:14.640 --> 01:21.520]  Did any plainclothes officers enter the Capitol on January 6?
[01:21.520 --> 01:25.080]  I don't know the answer to that, Senator.
[01:25.080 --> 01:30.040]  Mr. Olsen, I got to say your answer is to many questions today are disappointing because
[01:30.040 --> 01:32.200]  they've all down to essentially I don't know.
[01:32.200 --> 01:33.560]  Did you prepare for this hearing?
[01:33.560 --> 01:44.920]  Did you know this hearing was happening before this morning?
[01:44.920 --> 01:45.920]  The direct answer.
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.320]  Yes, I prepared extensively, Senator.
[01:49.320 --> 01:53.600]  Many of the questions are about specific facts that I don't have.
[01:53.600 --> 02:03.120]  I think one of the most important points that I would emphasize is, again, it's a general
[02:03.120 --> 02:04.120]  matter.
[02:04.120 --> 02:06.840]  It's not appropriate to comment on ongoing investigations.
[02:06.840 --> 02:11.160]  I didn't ask you about an ongoing investigation, but I just flipped to the cover of my binder
[02:11.160 --> 02:12.160]  here.
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.680]  It says the title of this hearing is the domestic terrorism threat one year after January 6.
[02:16.680 --> 02:20.760]  The Attorney General has repeatedly said this is one of the Department's highest priority.
[02:20.760 --> 02:24.560]  You're testifying a hearing about the domestic terrorism threat one year after January 6.
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.080]  You can't answer questions about how many people have been charged for events arising
[02:28.080 --> 02:30.440]  out of January 6.
[02:30.440 --> 02:34.160]  Would you go into a briefing with the Attorney General, your boss, and not be able to answer
[02:34.160 --> 02:37.560]  such basic questions?
[02:37.560 --> 02:42.320]  On the last question you asked, Senator, over 700 people have been charged in connection
[02:42.320 --> 02:44.000]  with January 6.
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.240]  About 325 have been charged with serious felonies in connection with attacks on the county.
[02:50.240 --> 02:53.840]  Ten minutes ago, Senator Cruz asked you this series of questions and you didn't have the
[02:53.840 --> 02:54.840]  answer.
[02:54.840 --> 02:57.080]  You didn't have the answer for how many people have been charged with violent offenses or
[02:57.080 --> 02:59.240]  nonviolent offenses and so on and so forth.
[02:59.240 --> 03:03.280]  Have you been given the answer in the last ten minutes?
[03:03.280 --> 03:09.000]  I'm sorry if I misunderstood, Senator, but I believe that Senator Cruz was asking me about
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.520]  other events, not the January 6 events.
[03:13.520 --> 03:17.800]  Let's turn to another issue that came up earlier today, Ray Epps.
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.120]  During the January 6 riots last year, Mr. Epps was caught on video several times.
[03:23.120 --> 03:29.960]  He seemed to encourage people to enter the Capitol to break down police barriers.
[03:29.960 --> 03:36.680]  Video from the rally down the National Mall earlier today shows him doing the same thing.
[03:36.680 --> 03:40.680]  Video even from the night before shows him encouraging people to enter the Capitol.
[03:40.680 --> 03:41.880]  Ray Epps lives in Arizona.
[03:41.880 --> 03:44.400]  He didn't exactly go underground after January 6.
[03:44.400 --> 03:48.120]  He even gave an interview to local media and he was well known to the Department of Justice.
[03:48.120 --> 03:54.080]  He was on the FBI's Capital Riot Most Wanted page just days after January 6.
[03:54.080 --> 04:01.400]  In fact, he was one of the first 16 suspects added to that Most Wanted page on your website.
[04:01.400 --> 04:05.560]  It does not appear that he's been arrested or charged in any offense.
[04:05.560 --> 04:11.520]  In July, without explanation, he was removed from the FBI's Most Wanted page.
[04:11.520 --> 04:18.040]  Mr. Olson, who is Ray Epps and why was he removed from the FBI's Most Wanted list?
[04:18.040 --> 04:26.160]  Senator, I don't have any information about that individual that we deferred to Ms. Sanborn
[04:26.160 --> 04:27.160]  for any additional...
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.160]  Okay.
[04:28.160 --> 04:29.160]  So this is...
[04:29.160 --> 04:34.600]  It gets back to what I meant earlier, not asking if you're prepared for this hearing.
[04:34.600 --> 04:37.000]  You're the Assistant Attorney General for National Security.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.560]  You run the National Security Division.
[04:38.560 --> 04:44.240]  The Department has said that these January 6 prosecutions are one of their highest priorities.
[04:44.240 --> 04:49.680]  This is the man who was on the Most Wanted page for six months.
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.360]  Do you really expect us to believe that you've never heard of the name Ray Epps or you don't
[04:54.360 --> 04:58.040]  know anything about him?
[04:58.040 --> 05:01.000]  I simply don't have any information at all.
[05:01.000 --> 05:07.200]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[05:07.200 --> 05:11.800]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making

[05:59.920 --> 06:02.920]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[06:59.920 --> 07:13.760]  I know why you did it, I know you were afraid, wouldn't me, war, terror, disease, there were
[07:13.760 --> 07:19.760]  a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[07:19.760 --> 07:24.880]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high Chancellor Adam
[07:24.880 --> 07:25.880]  Sutler.
[07:25.880 --> 07:31.200]  He promised you order, he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent
[07:31.200 --> 07:39.400]  obedient consent.
[07:39.400 --> 07:42.840]  There is a war, it's happening now.
[07:42.840 --> 07:47.400]  It will decide the fate of humanity, the time to choose sides has come.
[07:47.400 --> 07:58.200]  We are the resistance, we are the info war.
[07:58.200 --> 08:03.520]  It's Monday, January 17th of the year is 2022.
[08:03.520 --> 08:09.680]  We are either the last days of the Republic and the fall of Liberty Worldwide or the crossroads
[08:09.680 --> 08:13.400]  of rebirth of the new Renaissance.
[08:13.400 --> 08:18.960]  That is the crossroads, the globalist great reset or the great awakening.
[08:18.960 --> 08:23.760]  Tulsi Gabbard's one on Fox News this weekend warned about the announcement that all opposition
[08:23.760 --> 08:24.760]  are terrorists.
[08:24.760 --> 08:30.200]  I have the actual speech of the Deputy Attorney General, I have the text of it in the video
[08:30.200 --> 08:35.160]  saying any resistance to quote authority is terrorism.
[08:35.160 --> 08:40.920]  This is the creed of Kim Jong-un, this is the creed of Adolf Hitler and we must come
[08:40.920 --> 08:45.800]  together regardless of what political party we are in or what color we are or sexual preference
[08:45.800 --> 08:48.080]  and realize this or be slaves forever.
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.840]  Welcome back, so I was speaking just now about the creeping authoritarianism we are seeing
[08:52.840 --> 08:58.200]  from Biden and the Democrats and someone who has been such a strong voice on that issue
[08:58.200 --> 09:02.440]  is former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard who I am delighted to say joins us now.
[09:02.440 --> 09:05.160]  Aloha Tulsi, happy new year, how are you doing?
[09:05.160 --> 09:10.360]  Aloha Steve, it's always good to talk to you, happy new year to you as well.
[09:10.360 --> 09:15.720]  So look, you've spoken out against this, it seems to be getting worse, the particularly
[09:15.720 --> 09:21.160]  chilling thing was this new, I don't know what to call it, this frightening new move
[09:21.160 --> 09:27.360]  from the Justice Department, we saw the Deputy Attorney General earlier, talking about anyone
[09:27.360 --> 09:35.240]  who is anti-authority being part of this move against domestic violent extremists, what
[09:35.240 --> 09:36.600]  do you make of that?
[09:36.600 --> 09:42.760]  Yeah, Steve, I think it's really important to bold highlight and underline what he said.
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.440]  We have the Deputy Attorney General of the United States speaking to the American people
[09:47.440 --> 09:53.400]  about how they are standing up a domestic terrorism unit to support their efforts to
[09:53.400 --> 10:01.560]  target those who hold anti-government or anti-authority ideologies and we stop and think about that
[10:01.560 --> 10:02.560]  for a second.
[10:02.560 --> 10:07.800]  What does that really mean, the authorities in our government, the Biden administration,
[10:07.800 --> 10:13.920]  are targeting Americans for holding anti-authority views?
[10:13.920 --> 10:17.200]  That is authoritarianism, and what does that mean to us here at home, we're supposed to
[10:17.200 --> 10:23.320]  just sit back, passively follow along, put those blinders on and do whatever they tell
[10:23.320 --> 10:29.640]  us to do, that undermines the heart of our democratic republic, that undermines the
[10:29.640 --> 10:35.600]  essence of our constitution, which says we have the freedom to challenge our authorities,
[10:35.600 --> 10:40.840]  we have the freedom to stand and protest, to ask questions, to demand accountability
[10:40.840 --> 10:42.000]  and answers.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.800]  And if we lose that freedom, and this is where they're exposing their anti-liberty, anti-democracy
[10:47.800 --> 10:54.840]  mindset, which is so dangerous, because if we lose that, then we no longer have a democracy.
[10:54.840 --> 11:04.800]  Totally, and actually I completely agree with that.
[11:04.800 --> 11:08.600]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much again for joining us on
[11:08.600 --> 11:16.920]  this live, Monday, January 17th, 2022 broadcast, wow.
[11:16.920 --> 11:25.840]  Every show I started by basically pointing out that we are living in incredible times,
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.480]  and I know that it's hard on all of you out there because you're awake and you're aware
[11:30.480 --> 11:31.480]  of what's happening.
[11:31.480 --> 11:37.160]  They say ignorance is bliss until the ignorance destroys you, and the Bible says many times
[11:37.160 --> 11:43.640]  at the beginning of knowledge comes great sorrow, and I know that I'm overwhelmed, so
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.840]  I know that you're overwhelmed as well, and I can intellectually, I can historically,
[11:48.840 --> 11:52.760]  I can politically with my street smarts, look at all this information in front of me, that's
[11:52.760 --> 11:59.120]  each stack is just amazing information, but the overarching reason this is all happening
[11:59.120 --> 12:05.240]  is we have gotten away from God, and we've gotten away from our entire genetic development
[12:05.240 --> 12:11.820]  on this planet, and what we're supposed to do, we're supposed to do carpentry, we're
[12:11.820 --> 12:16.360]  supposed to fish and hunt, we're supposed to grow crops, we're supposed to sit around
[12:16.360 --> 12:23.240]  a campfire, we're supposed to stand up for our families, and when we don't do that,
[12:23.240 --> 12:29.000]  we lose our connection to God, because God works through the environment that God created.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.560]  So the greatest cathedral in the world is the forest or the seashore or the sunset or
[12:33.560 --> 12:39.240]  your backyard looking at the stars, and it's fun to hate the Democrats and the globalists
[12:39.240 --> 12:43.280]  and the Satanists, and to get on their level and just talk about how horrible they are,
[12:43.280 --> 12:47.040]  and they need to be exposed, and people like that, and I like to do it, and I became very
[12:47.040 --> 12:50.800]  successful being angry at these people.
[12:50.800 --> 12:56.080]  But God has really touched my heart, especially in this time we're entering, that Klaus Schwab
[12:56.080 --> 12:59.920]  says they want to raise the temperature, the globalists say they want to cause fighting
[12:59.920 --> 13:05.160]  and civil war, and as much as we have a right with this illegitimate government, other Declaration
[13:05.160 --> 13:10.920]  of Independence, to throw off these forms of government, we don't have the organization
[13:10.920 --> 13:15.440]  and the statesmen, the leadership like they had back then in 1776, and they were still
[13:15.440 --> 13:20.320]  fighting an uphill battle, and they were fighting a system that wasn't one-tenth as evil, not
[13:20.320 --> 13:21.320]  even one-hundredth.
[13:21.320 --> 13:25.640]  Hell, King George was pretty good compared to these people.
[13:25.640 --> 13:28.840]  He was just dominating them and making them go through him to be able to do business,
[13:28.840 --> 13:31.600]  and they didn't like it, and I understand that.
[13:31.600 --> 13:34.800]  They were slaves, everybody was basically.
[13:34.800 --> 13:39.960]  These globalists that we have in control today want to end the human system as we know it
[13:39.960 --> 13:45.920]  and want to turn us all into corporate commodities, and so we must resist it, but until the public
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.040]  understands the great reset and transhumanism of the New World Order and the big goal, going
[13:50.040 --> 13:54.880]  out and attacking people, going out and having a war, going out and taking over the TV stations
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.080]  in D.C. and taking over key federal buildings, that's what you'd really do if you were wanting
[13:59.080 --> 14:04.240]  to, quote, have a coup, is illegitimate, and it would cause a bigger division in the country
[14:04.240 --> 14:08.680]  and the globalists are all set up for that and want that to happen, and they're trying
[14:08.680 --> 14:13.320]  to get that, so that's why now a year after, in retrospect, and I was right the night after
[14:13.320 --> 14:17.600]  it happened, I broke down what I thought had happened, and now it turns out I was dead
[14:17.600 --> 14:23.280]  on, was a case of neglect on purpose.
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.840]  Purposeful neglect with a thousand troops and FBI in plain clothes, letting the first
[14:27.840 --> 14:32.640]  hundred thugs, most of them anti-fug dressed up in Patriot gear, crushing through a few
[14:32.640 --> 14:40.400]  dozen riot police so that they could derail our million person march showing how we didn't
[14:40.400 --> 14:43.600]  mind the official story.
[14:43.600 --> 14:49.080]  That was terrible, and with the breakdown of civilization and with the breakdown of society,
[14:49.080 --> 14:53.200]  the last thing we need is any type of paramilitary garbage, so I'm going to tell everybody out
[14:53.200 --> 15:00.720]  there who's in a militia or who is in Oathkeepers or who is in Proud Boys, a lot of the ideas
[15:00.720 --> 15:04.920]  and things espoused are good, the militias in the Constitution, it's in the Bill of
[15:04.920 --> 15:06.920]  Rights.
[15:06.920 --> 15:10.360]  I'm not saying you're individually bad because you want to train and be prepared to defend
[15:10.360 --> 15:14.200]  your country, that's a normal male instinct and good, and you should train to protect
[15:14.200 --> 15:17.280]  yourself and your family, and you should try to work with the Sheriff's Department, Police
[15:17.280 --> 15:23.080]  Department, and others, and you should use your influence at City Council and school
[15:23.080 --> 15:29.000]  boards and everywhere to be heard, and you should train to defend this Republic, but
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.080]  I know for a fact they've got camps shut up in places like North Carolina and Kentucky
[15:34.080 --> 15:40.040]  and Virginia, where they are recruiting young people online and others using Q-type BS that
[15:40.040 --> 15:46.680]  there's a big uprising about to happen, and you really work for Trump, and he's secretly
[15:46.680 --> 15:51.320]  going to do this, to launch some type of new attack that will be much more violent than
[15:51.320 --> 15:56.080]  the Capitol fiasco before the midterms to bring in real martial law, and it's our number
[15:56.080 --> 16:00.400]  one mission to stop that from happening.
[16:00.400 --> 16:05.280]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[16:05.280 --> 16:07.280]  the globalists are doing right now.
[16:07.280 --> 16:11.520]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover, and this is the point that they're
[16:11.520 --> 16:14.400]  very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[16:14.400 --> 16:18.440]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[16:18.440 --> 16:19.440]  in the open.
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.960]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.200]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[16:28.200 --> 16:31.640]  So listen Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[16:31.640 --> 16:36.120]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infoarstore.com
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.120]  you keep us on air.

[16:55.840 --> 16:59.680]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[16:59.680 --> 17:04.480]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[17:04.480 --> 17:06.520]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[17:06.520 --> 17:12.240]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[17:12.240 --> 17:13.240]  But we failed.
[17:13.240 --> 17:14.720]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[17:14.720 --> 17:20.480]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[17:20.480 --> 17:22.840]  deindustrialization, great reset.
[17:22.840 --> 17:27.140]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[17:27.140 --> 17:31.760]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[17:31.760 --> 17:35.080]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've
[17:35.080 --> 17:36.840]  also got to get personally prepared.
[17:36.840 --> 17:39.560]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.

[18:46.760 --> 18:49.840]  I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[18:49.840 --> 18:50.840]  don't work.
[18:50.840 --> 18:51.840]  They work.
[18:51.840 --> 18:59.840]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[18:59.840 --> 19:12.440]  William in California, people are asleep and program controlled.
[19:12.440 --> 19:13.440]  I agree.
[19:13.440 --> 19:14.840]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[19:14.840 --> 19:15.840]  Hi, Alex.
[19:15.840 --> 19:16.840]  Thanks for taking my call.
[19:16.840 --> 19:17.840]  Can I plug Alex real quick?
[19:17.840 --> 19:18.840]  Yeah, go ahead.
[19:18.840 --> 19:25.400]  Hey, I'm in my 60s and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds and I worked them into the
[19:25.400 --> 19:29.840]  ground and you wanted to know why and I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let
[19:29.840 --> 19:32.640]  me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[19:32.640 --> 19:33.640]  I really do.
[19:33.640 --> 19:36.720]  I take that B12 and I am electric, man.
[19:36.720 --> 19:37.960]  I can run 10 miles.
[19:37.960 --> 19:43.040]  I did some pretty heavy work with the highway department and my friends will attest to the
[19:43.040 --> 19:47.840]  fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70.
[19:47.840 --> 20:00.840]  And I know I'm not just blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life.
[20:00.840 --> 20:11.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.840 --> 20:22.320]  All right, everybody knows that I don't like Brian Stelter and he's everything I don't
[20:22.320 --> 20:23.320]  want to be.
[20:23.320 --> 20:26.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:26.120 --> 20:29.520]  And normally when I start getting into something Stelter's doing, because he is the mouthpiece
[20:29.520 --> 20:33.240]  of Jeff Zucker, he is the mouth of the New World Order.
[20:33.240 --> 20:37.080]  What you hear is a script he's fed.
[20:37.080 --> 20:41.400]  I start attacking how he looks and just how he gives me the heebie-jeebies.
[20:41.400 --> 20:44.800]  I'm not going to do that next segment.
[20:44.800 --> 20:49.600]  I'm going to play what he has to say and then fully debunk it to show you how gaslighting
[20:49.600 --> 20:50.600]  works.
[20:50.600 --> 20:53.800]  This is going to be very important coming up next segment.
[20:53.800 --> 21:01.400]  And again, I'm going to refrain from my normal attacks on him because, again, I'm trying
[21:01.400 --> 21:05.920]  to be more professional here because the time is just, things are too dangerous right now.
[21:05.920 --> 21:09.920]  And so I'm sorry to listeners that I'm going to cut back on the comedy and cut back on
[21:09.920 --> 21:13.440]  the jokes, even though I like it more than you do probably, because things are just too
[21:13.440 --> 21:14.940]  damn serious.
[21:14.940 --> 21:19.960]  Call the Holy Spirit whatever you want to, just tells me to be calling for peace and
[21:19.960 --> 21:26.160]  to be very, very, very serious because we are all in grave danger.
[21:26.160 --> 21:30.280]  We're already in deep, deep, deep trouble.
[21:30.280 --> 21:35.880]  I don't want to have to remind you that I will, but these shots, a racial immune system
[21:35.880 --> 21:41.880]  that caused massive heart problems and blood clots up front and the same scientist, top
[21:41.880 --> 21:47.240]  guys in the world, inventors of mRNA, former chief scientist, Pfizer, head of the EU advisory
[21:47.240 --> 21:48.240]  board.
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.320]  I mean, you can't get more star studded.
[21:50.320 --> 21:54.040]  Everything they said so far, they said early on heart attacks and blood clots and auto
[21:54.040 --> 21:56.280]  immune and then cancer.
[21:56.280 --> 21:58.640]  And then yeah, most people will be dead in six years.
[21:58.640 --> 22:06.400]  I mean, the discoverer of HIV that won the Nobel Prize in France says he thinks half
[22:06.400 --> 22:08.640]  the people that take it will be dead within six years.
[22:08.640 --> 22:17.400]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I knew this stuff was coming, but now that we're actually
[22:17.400 --> 22:23.560]  here, I can't take it.
[22:23.560 --> 22:27.360]  And I'm just telling everybody in the military and the bureaucracy and everybody, I'm not
[22:27.360 --> 22:28.440]  looking for a fight with you.
[22:28.440 --> 22:29.920]  You're under it as much attack as I am.
[22:29.920 --> 22:39.320]  And I saw a beautiful black lady walking out of a grocery store yesterday.
[22:39.320 --> 22:40.320]  And I said, hey, you're in the army.
[22:40.320 --> 22:41.320]  What are you in?
[22:41.320 --> 22:43.360]  And she told me, I said, have you taken the shot?
[22:43.360 --> 22:46.200]  She said, oh man, they made me take the second one.
[22:46.200 --> 22:48.640]  Worst thing ever, worst thing I've ever felt.
[22:48.640 --> 22:49.640]  I said, what brain fog?
[22:49.640 --> 22:52.040]  She goes, oh yeah, I'm just now getting over it.
[22:52.040 --> 22:55.040]  And she said, oh, my stomach hurts so bad.
[22:55.040 --> 23:04.280]  And I said, oh, she said, yeah, period, because we know that most women that take it have
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.360]  serious menstrual problems for continually.
[23:08.360 --> 23:11.880]  It's like, if you took it six months ago, you've had menstrual problems for six months.
[23:11.880 --> 23:13.600]  If you took it a year ago, you've had it for a year.
[23:13.600 --> 23:15.640]  They're like, well, we hope it's only temporary.
[23:15.640 --> 23:20.200]  I mean, again, I see a woman walking out in her army uniform out of a store with some
[23:20.200 --> 23:21.200]  bags of groceries.
[23:21.200 --> 23:26.040]  And I'm not trying to brag, it's true, she goes, yeah, you're Alex Jones, I've seen
[23:26.040 --> 23:27.040]  you on Joe Rogan.
[23:27.040 --> 23:29.200]  It's always Joe Rogan, he's so huge.
[23:29.200 --> 23:33.680]  But the point was, this was a beautiful woman.
[23:33.680 --> 23:38.560]  I suppose she's black because they always mention what race somebody is, but I'm looking
[23:38.560 --> 23:45.240]  at this lady, and I just felt like asking her, I felt like saying, hey, how are you doing?
[23:45.240 --> 23:51.480]  You take the shot, she goes, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[23:51.480 --> 23:52.480]  I'm just now starting to get over it.
[23:52.480 --> 23:59.200]  I said, oh, I mean, I mean, that's how real this is that I just randomly am walking into
[23:59.200 --> 24:03.560]  a grocery store.
[24:03.560 --> 24:06.760]  And the first person I talked to has got hurt by it.
[24:06.760 --> 24:10.400]  That's not statistics I'm reading in some document would show it's off the chart bad.
[24:10.400 --> 24:12.360]  That's not top scientists telling me.
[24:12.360 --> 24:16.520]  That's the first person I see in a uniform.
[24:16.520 --> 24:21.520]  I've got family that's in the military that took it.
[24:21.520 --> 24:23.320]  And one of them got really, really sick.
[24:23.320 --> 24:25.440]  The other one didn't feel it at all.
[24:25.440 --> 24:29.640]  And that's because they're doing weird tests, they admit, where summit groups get sailing
[24:29.640 --> 24:33.040]  because they're doing tests, they're watching what happens these groups, and some people
[24:33.040 --> 24:34.040]  don't.
[24:34.040 --> 24:38.960]  They've all got an ID, a federal global UN ID on who got the shot and who didn't.
[24:38.960 --> 24:44.440]  So you'll be in the same line, and you get the mutinogenic shot, the next person gets
[24:44.440 --> 24:47.760]  the sailing.
[24:47.760 --> 24:49.120]  So I've got all this news to cover.
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.440]  I'm just saying that they want us fighting with each other, and it's all stupid.
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.400]  And I've been just as guilty as anybody, and the left deserves to be criticized and attacked.
[24:58.400 --> 25:05.000]  But we've got to transcend that together and get past the dumb debate and say, really,
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  guys?
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.240]  Hundreds of thousands of influencers are getting paid billions of dollars.
[25:10.240 --> 25:14.600]  Pfizer's paid out about $10 billion, they now admit, just in the last year.
[25:14.600 --> 25:19.040]  So that number is about six months behind, part of the year before last and then part
[25:19.040 --> 25:20.040]  of last year.
[25:20.040 --> 25:26.120]  Imagine how much they spent now, $10 billion.
[25:26.120 --> 25:31.040]  And then once they've already injected 70% of the public, they tell you, oh, sorry,
[25:31.040 --> 25:36.200]  the vaccine's linked to lowering immunity, and the boosters really screw it up, oh,
[25:36.200 --> 25:39.680]  what did the top scientists tell us 20 months ago?
[25:39.680 --> 25:44.400]  Because they've all signed nondisclosures, and they've all been involved, but they were
[25:44.400 --> 25:51.360]  all involved in these projects that failed at the University of Texas and at the big
[25:51.360 --> 25:54.440]  facilities in London and in Montreal.
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.360]  I've gone and reverse engineered it all.
[25:56.360 --> 25:58.240]  This stuff all failed the last 20 years.
[25:58.240 --> 26:02.720]  And Bill Gates, the New World Order, picked a failed program to give it to you because
[26:02.720 --> 26:04.160]  you know why?
[26:04.160 --> 26:08.640]  Because it failed because it hurt all the lab animals and killed most of them.
[26:08.640 --> 26:11.040]  And of course they did secret human trials in China.
[26:11.040 --> 26:12.040]  That's come out.
[26:12.040 --> 26:20.600]  So they took a failed program because it ain't failed if you use it for different mission.
[26:20.600 --> 26:26.840]  And so we're looking at a program of extermination going on, and you can play games and you can
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.840]  pretend, but I mean, would you really want to be a Justice Department person and in your
[26:31.840 --> 26:37.280]  coded thing, they look at it and they give you the saline, everybody else gets the cancer
[26:37.280 --> 26:38.280]  shot?
[26:38.280 --> 26:39.640]  I mean, is that really who you want to be?
[26:39.640 --> 26:40.880]  Because that's going on.
[26:40.880 --> 26:44.960]  They have had whistleblowers in high-level government ministries in Europe come out and
[26:44.960 --> 26:51.560]  say that the boxes come in with labels on the main big case, not on individual vials,
[26:51.560 --> 26:55.800]  but on the main case, give this to groups such as such numbers, give this to such as
[26:55.800 --> 26:56.800]  such numbers.
[26:56.800 --> 26:59.880]  That's why people in the U.S. and Europe have, it's been on the news, they've confirmed
[26:59.880 --> 27:00.880]  it.
[27:00.880 --> 27:04.000]  Pharmacist and people at these big things go, we don't know why.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  We look at a computer and it tells us, okay, you're a white lady, we got you this shot.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.800]  Oh, you're a black man, we got you this shot.
[27:10.800 --> 27:16.000]  So we haven't figured out exactly what's going on, but I don't really need to have their
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.520]  documents to know exactly what that is.
[27:18.520 --> 27:21.840]  If there's a vaccine, it should be the same damn thing for everybody.
[27:21.840 --> 27:28.720]  No, that's why they keep catching them, giving people saline, or catching them, giving them
[27:28.720 --> 27:31.440]  something different, because this is a giant experiment.
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.960]  And I'm not sure exactly what it is, but we know the side effects of it are killing a
[27:35.960 --> 27:40.680]  bunch of people, and we know the scientists say that what this shot does is mutates every
[27:40.680 --> 27:47.800]  part of your body, but particularly fast-growing cells that have the same protein as the virus.
[27:47.800 --> 27:57.640]  That's why in your nuclear fallout, your intestines and your gums and your mucous membranes are
[27:57.640 --> 28:02.600]  the fastest-growing cells, and so they disintegrate and die because the radiation has the biggest
[28:02.600 --> 28:05.080]  effect on them.
[28:05.080 --> 28:09.240]  Things like your cornea and things that don't reproduce or brain cells that don't reproduce
[28:09.240 --> 28:12.740]  the last things it hits, that's the same thing here.
[28:12.740 --> 28:20.320]  This virus, and then the vaccine that mimics the virus, hits your fast-growing cells.
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.880]  And so they've also found already in studies that the better shape you're in, the worse
[28:25.880 --> 28:30.840]  it is because the virus gets caught up in fat and wants to just live in fat.
[28:30.840 --> 28:34.960]  But if you don't have any fat, if you're a 3% body fat, if you're a top soccer player
[28:34.960 --> 28:41.440]  or a top runner, the virus is going to run, the vaccine is going to run through you and
[28:41.440 --> 28:44.080]  reproduce and take over your whole body.
[28:44.080 --> 28:45.640]  And it's, you're gone.
[28:45.640 --> 28:49.680]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back and hit all the big news today.
[28:49.680 --> 28:51.040]  There is so much.
[28:51.040 --> 28:52.960]  But any broadcast we're doing could be our last.
[28:52.960 --> 29:00.120]  I mean, we are two minutes to midnight, all of us together.
[29:00.120 --> 29:02.360]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[29:02.360 --> 29:07.640]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to
[29:07.640 --> 29:09.840]  the new year at infowarsstore.com.

[30:03.400 --> 30:04.400]  Welcome.
[30:04.400 --> 30:05.400]  Hello, Alex.
[30:05.400 --> 30:06.400]  Yes, Malcolm.
[30:06.400 --> 30:07.400]  All right.
[30:07.400 --> 30:09.400]  Let's go ahead and get on the line.
[30:09.400 --> 30:14.440]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[30:14.440 --> 30:17.160]  Supermal vitality and brain force plus.
[30:17.160 --> 30:20.120]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[30:20.120 --> 30:21.720]  Supermal vitality really, really works.
[30:21.720 --> 30:26.640]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[30:26.640 --> 30:32.320]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well,
[30:32.320 --> 30:33.320]  but just aren't as strong.
[30:33.320 --> 30:35.280]  This is like a very fine wine.
[30:35.280 --> 30:37.280]  In fact, each batch is different.
[30:37.280 --> 30:38.880]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[30:38.880 --> 30:39.880]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[30:39.880 --> 30:42.760]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[30:42.760 --> 30:43.760]  strong?
[30:43.760 --> 30:44.760]  That's just how it is.
[30:44.760 --> 30:45.760]  It's how it works.
[30:45.760 --> 30:47.280]  So it's always good.
[30:47.280 --> 30:49.400]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[30:49.400 --> 31:00.160]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[31:00.160 --> 31:01.520]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[31:01.520 --> 31:03.480]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[31:03.480 --> 31:04.480]  Welcome.
[31:04.480 --> 31:05.480]  Hello, Alex.
[31:05.480 --> 31:06.480]  Yes, Malcolm.
[31:06.480 --> 31:07.600]  Welcome back to Idlimo.
[31:07.600 --> 31:08.540]  Great to see you again.
[31:08.540 --> 31:10.120]  Sorry that some of you aren't here yet.
[31:10.120 --> 31:11.120]  Awesome.
[31:11.120 --> 31:12.120]  Welcome to Idlimo.
[31:12.120 --> 31:13.120]  Out對不對.
[31:13.120 --> 31:14.120]  I'mопас.
[31:14.120 --> 31:15.320]  How are you doing, Malcolm?
[31:15.320 --> 31:16.820]  Welcome to Idlimo.
[31:16.820 --> 31:18.360]  Good to see you.
[31:18.360 --> 31:19.360]  Hi, Malcolm.
[31:19.360 --> 31:20.360]  Hi, Desambucans.
[31:20.360 --> 31:21.360]  Jordan.
[31:21.360 --> 31:22.360]  How are you doing?
[31:22.360 --> 31:23.360]  Welcome to Idlimo.
[31:23.360 --> 31:24.360]  How are you doing?
[31:24.360 --> 31:25.360]  Welcome toHz.
[31:25.360 --> 31:30.440]  In松 たみがです Gore it's nothing but a pleasure to welcome all of you at YiLion.
[31:30.440 --> 31:34.680]  versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine
[31:34.680 --> 31:39.640]  wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[31:39.640 --> 31:42.920]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[31:42.920 --> 31:48.440]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like
[31:48.440 --> 31:53.160]  super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[31:53.160 --> 32:05.720]  Unrun contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to the United
[32:05.720 --> 32:10.520]  States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and
[32:10.520 --> 32:16.440]  then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night
[32:16.440 --> 32:21.960]  to their facilities. And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where
[32:21.960 --> 32:26.600]  they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety. This
[32:26.600 --> 32:31.320]  is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality
[32:31.320 --> 32:36.040]  Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[32:36.040 --> 32:41.960]  government military grade at infowarstore.com. We have the entire line of silent pocket ready
[32:41.960 --> 32:47.640]  to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com. Again, we have big backpacks. We have special

[32:52.360 --> 32:58.200]  It's all there at infowarstore.com. So protect your privacy today and support the info war
[32:58.200 --> 33:06.760]  at infowarstore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:06.760 --> 33:21.560]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[33:22.600 --> 33:27.320]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:29.160 --> 33:33.560]  All right, we've already blasted through 30 plus minutes of this transmission today. I need to
[33:33.560 --> 33:41.560]  start digging into the news and covering it all for you here today. But the first big thing I want to
[33:41.560 --> 33:49.560]  hit is Brian Stelter, which means the mouth of the establishment attacking Glenn Beck.
[33:50.520 --> 33:56.680]  And I've been a big critic of Glenn Beck because he said I was making up the FEMA camp plans
[33:57.320 --> 34:01.000]  back under Obama to put Americans in camps. I got real army documents.
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.920]  A few years later, the army admitted they were real. That Obama was preparing to put Americans,
[34:06.920 --> 34:12.440]  quote, in reeducation camps, which is a Soviet brainwashing term, a brainwashing camp.
[34:13.480 --> 34:18.760]  And I get Glenn Beck thought, okay, this guy down in Austin, when he was still in New York,
[34:20.040 --> 34:23.800]  doesn't have army intelligence, giving him secret documents. The guy's a damn liar.
[34:25.160 --> 34:30.360]  Later, it got declassified. It was a real document. Okay. And finally, as the world changed,
[34:30.360 --> 34:35.400]  and Glenn Beck woke up, he doesn't need to listen to Alex Jones. He's a smart guy. He now is as
[34:35.400 --> 34:39.800]  hardcore as we are. And I've been up to his place. He gave me a painting, and we're friends, and
[34:40.760 --> 34:45.480]  he's doing a great job. And, you know, it was Dr. Mercola, then it was Dr.
[34:46.200 --> 34:51.160]  then it was RFK Jr. And then another doctor, where I have all had the number one books on
[34:51.160 --> 34:59.080]  Amazon, selling millions of copies of peace about COVID-19 roll out of the Great Reset in
[34:59.080 --> 35:08.680]  the tyranny. Well, he now has a book about it, and it's number one. And Brian Stelter flips out on it
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.560]  and says, there is no Great Reset. There is no global group that used COVID to make more money.
[35:15.560 --> 35:19.480]  There is no plan to shut down the little guy. When Klaus Schwab admits all that in his book.
[35:19.480 --> 35:29.400]  So here's the good news. We got Tulsi Gabbards. We got Glenn Beck. We got, I think, the names
[35:29.400 --> 35:34.920]  go on forever. Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and everybody else and Congress people on both sides
[35:34.920 --> 35:39.720]  going, hey, this is a global government plan. They admit it. They want to shut society down
[35:39.720 --> 35:44.920]  and take over. And they're using the virus bringing a world ID. And if people get that,
[35:44.920 --> 35:50.840]  then we'll understand that all the fear mongering and control is about putting us in a permanent
[35:50.840 --> 35:59.320]  prison. And then they won't be able to do this anymore. Because you see, I'm not in competition
[35:59.320 --> 36:05.240]  with Tucker Carlson or Glenn Beck. I want either one of them to become, you know, the biggest thing
[36:05.240 --> 36:10.920]  ever seen with a billion viewers a day. So I can survive and save my children's future. Because
[36:10.920 --> 36:14.760]  I've known this is real. I've known they're coming with depopulation. I've known they're coming
[36:14.760 --> 36:18.280]  with a shutdown. And people will ask me, why are you promoting other shows? Why don't you ever care
[36:18.280 --> 36:24.600]  about yourself? I do care about myself. I'm trying to be the big daddy here. I'm not trying to be
[36:28.600 --> 36:35.000]  I am spending my time trying to get influencers, I know, to talk about reality. And I send them
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.640]  articles and I send them briefings and I send them reports. And I sent Congress and the FCC
[36:39.640 --> 36:45.320]  documents and President Trump has to try to stop the censorship. And that totally pissed off the
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.280]  deep state that I was briefing the president four years ago, not about some business I wanted,
[36:50.280 --> 36:55.560]  not about something for Alex Jones, I had top law firms writing up memos to the president
[36:57.640 --> 37:02.360]  to try to actually get good policy for America. Had anybody lobbied for actual freedom,
[37:02.360 --> 37:05.880]  just because it was the right thing to do? No. And that's why I became the number one enemy.
[37:05.880 --> 37:14.040]  So I'm explaining it again. My life depends and your life depends on people getting the war
[37:14.040 --> 37:18.360]  we're in, that it's the globalist, that it's a corporate takeover, that it's a corporate consolidation,
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.000]  that it's a system that slowly cuts off resources and then tells people that the people cutting
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.600]  off the resources are the saviors to get them to sign on to be slaves of the system for the
[37:28.600 --> 37:35.000]  dwindling resources, not realizing it's a trap. We'll take a few segments to get to and I'm going
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.280]  to hit the video next segment of Brian Stelter attacking Glenn Beck and Tucker Carl's.
[37:42.040 --> 37:45.240]  But remember, he literally just reads off a teleprompter. That's why
[37:47.080 --> 37:52.840]  he's important. He has no viewers to speak of, but he is the mouth of the new world order.
[37:54.200 --> 38:01.000]  So here's the headline. This is nonsense. Stelter blast Fox and Glenn Beck for false
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.080]  cover story. He says no one wants to put the unvaccinated in camps. That's just in 12 state
[38:07.080 --> 38:12.360]  bills. And Democrats openly announcing it and CDC documents. I'll show you right now. And you see
[38:12.360 --> 38:17.480]  it all over the world with Djokovic being locked up for weeks and kicked out. Oh, but nobody,
[38:17.480 --> 38:21.720]  Germany already has been locked down for months. So is a bunch of other countries, France,
[38:21.720 --> 38:32.200]  Austria, Australia as a hellhole, New Zealand, but oh, Israel. Oh, but no, no, there's nobody
[38:32.200 --> 38:38.440]  locking anybody up. He actually says that's a total insane live. And then he says, Glenn
[38:38.440 --> 38:42.440]  Beck claims there's an elite running this to consolidate money and power. Oh, let me show
[38:42.440 --> 38:52.280]  you something, Brian. Look at this article. Wealth of 10 richest men, double during pandemic
[38:53.480 --> 39:00.440]  incomes of 99% of humanity drop. And who ran it? Big tech and the intelligence agencies to literally
[39:01.400 --> 39:04.760]  impoverish and control people with siege.
[39:04.760 --> 39:17.240]  And it's so funny to these people. And if I wanted to get on the payrolls of these individuals,
[39:17.240 --> 39:24.600]  I could do it just like that. And once I could sit on some mountaintop chalet while I watch
[39:24.600 --> 39:29.000]  everything burn. And then finally, there's no civilization for me to spend my money in. No,
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.640]  no, thanks. And that's why all these billionaire globalists have run to the most remote areas
[39:33.640 --> 39:38.040]  and built private airfields and are hiding out great jobs. You've doubled your wealth and
[39:38.040 --> 39:42.440]  are about to burn the world down. So it'll be worth nothing. But that's the rationale. Well,
[39:42.440 --> 39:46.280]  that we need to depopulate something tells me you're not going to make it out of this either.
[39:46.280 --> 39:51.000]  So keep playing God. Keep letting Satan leaves you around by the nose. And that's what he says
[39:51.000 --> 39:58.600]  in this report coming up is, Oh, it's, it's just insane. He claims that the thing called a great
[39:58.600 --> 40:04.680]  reset. And there's these, I mean, they're literally launched a war on us. They're taking over. And
[40:04.680 --> 40:11.080]  I'm just simply trying to get people to understand what's really going on. Speaking of money,
[40:11.080 --> 40:16.520]  I'm not financed by any. Billionaires, though, if there are some out there that want to just
[40:16.520 --> 40:22.360]  give me money, no strings attached, I'll take it. I'm financed by the average person. And I've
[40:22.360 --> 40:26.440]  been so busy with all the insanity and the craziness and the federal subpoenas and the
[40:26.440 --> 40:30.920]  Jan 6 committees and all the rest of it. I've not cut ads in a week and a half. I don't even know
[40:30.920 --> 40:35.320]  what's going on. I just know we don't bring more money in. We'll shut down. And we need to bring
[40:35.320 --> 40:41.320]  in major capital. So hopefully today I can go cut new ads because we did have one of our products
[40:41.320 --> 40:46.200]  that sold out. It's a good product. Come back. Actually, two of them came back in two weeks ago.
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.920]  But I've been so busy, I haven't cut new ads at their back where we basically may be sold out
[40:50.920 --> 40:56.360]  today. A vitamin mineral fusion will be sold out in a couple of days of X2, even though I didn't
[40:56.360 --> 40:59.560]  think it was selling that quick. We've got a limited shipment. The best deep breath crystal iodine
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.120]  was the only deep breath crystal iodine that we know of anybody selling. So you get that full
[41:04.120 --> 41:09.560]  absorption of your body. That's really the secret weapon, the missing link. Both of those are 50%
[41:09.560 --> 41:13.160]  off. And I'm going to end the vitamin mineral fusion today because they told me it may sell out
[41:13.160 --> 41:19.000]  by the end of the show. And the X2, I'm going to have for three more days of 50% off. And then
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.320]  it's going to go to full price because we don't get more in for a couple of months.
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.160]  So that's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen. Ultimate bone broth is amazing.
[41:30.120 --> 41:34.120]  Winter sun was supposed to come in two weeks ago. It finally came in. We haven't put it back up for
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.200]  sale yet because I've been too busy even make that move. So it gives you a hand of some of the
[41:38.200 --> 41:42.520]  products that are back in stock that we haven't got back on sale yet because we are putting out
[41:42.520 --> 41:49.720]  fires everywhere. I made the strategic decision to not like you see dish network or direct TV
[41:49.720 --> 41:54.360]  taking OAN off. You see my pillow having their banking taken away because they said, well,
[41:54.360 --> 41:59.000]  we can't have folks investigated by the FBI, you know, having banks here. Well, I've been with you
[41:59.000 --> 42:06.440]  25 years selling pillows. Sorry. Bye bye. You're in a gulag now. First thing Nazis did, Jews can't
[42:06.440 --> 42:12.040]  sell stuff. Jews can't have businesses. It's just some bad stuff, folks. So all that's been going
[42:12.040 --> 42:16.360]  on behind the scenes. And I've been running around like a one legged man in an ass kicking contest
[42:16.360 --> 42:23.800]  for the last year, just keeping it where you can get funds in and buy products. So when I tell you,
[42:23.800 --> 42:28.040]  you want a t-shirt, you want a book, you want to film, you want a water filter, you want something
[42:28.040 --> 42:32.200]  and to get a product and know you support the info war. Now's the time to do it.
[42:34.120 --> 42:37.960]  And if they swat team me and throw me in prison next week, for God knows what, I need you to
[42:37.960 --> 42:42.600]  keep supporting that whatever ways we're still on air if we're here, but I'm not here trying
[42:42.600 --> 42:48.440]  wolf for no reason. I got a wolf chewing my guts out. Okay, we'll try it here. Right biting me.
[42:48.440 --> 42:52.040]  And I'm just staying on air, ignoring the pain because I know that's my mission,
[42:52.040 --> 42:55.400]  but we need your support plus the great products info war store.com.
[42:59.160 --> 43:05.880]  Christmas 2021 is gone. It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of
[43:05.880 --> 43:10.920]  Christmas prices going to the new year at infowarstore.com on two of our best selling products.

[43:56.760 --> 44:05.800]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[44:05.800 --> 44:10.760]  and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak,
[44:10.760 --> 44:16.360]  but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful and the social
[44:16.360 --> 44:21.880]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody
[44:21.880 --> 44:29.560]  knows who first came up with the boy is it true. The propaganda would not be necessary if the
[44:29.560 --> 44:35.160]  situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their
[44:35.160 --> 44:42.120]  evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they
[44:42.120 --> 44:46.840]  signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody
[44:46.840 --> 44:51.480]  keep info wars on the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the
[44:51.480 --> 44:57.000]  globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government
[44:57.000 --> 45:04.040]  and the mark of the beast they just announced. The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience,
[45:04.760 --> 45:11.400]  a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the
[45:11.400 --> 45:18.760]  global private corporations has put in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from
[45:18.760 --> 45:24.360]  which we will never emerge. It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover
[45:24.360 --> 45:33.080]  our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total
[45:33.080 --> 45:42.040]  absolute surrender to evil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future
[45:42.040 --> 45:46.600]  destiny of humanity is upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable
[45:46.600 --> 45:52.760]  microchips as part of the world ID and carbon taxes. Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[45:52.760 --> 45:58.760]  They only get better if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[45:58.760 --> 46:04.840]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop
[46:04.840 --> 46:10.200]  their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[46:10.200 --> 46:15.800]  operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flatfooted,
[46:15.800 --> 46:21.800]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.280]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[46:26.280 --> 46:30.680]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[46:30.680 --> 46:33.960]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[46:33.960 --> 46:37.720]  but we've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high
[46:37.720 --> 46:42.040]  quality storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices
[46:42.040 --> 46:47.400]  at infoworkstore.com. So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets,
[46:47.400 --> 46:52.920]  it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are
[46:52.920 --> 46:58.440]  long lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[47:22.920 --> 47:25.720]  I got nine lives.
[47:53.880 --> 47:59.320]  We are here and I don't know. Roger Stone is going to be able to come on. He's had really
[47:59.320 --> 48:03.880]  bad COVID for two weeks. He says the sickest he's been in his life. He sounds like Darth Vader.
[48:04.520 --> 48:10.120]  And I talked to him for 30 minutes yesterday and I said, you got to come on the air.
[48:10.680 --> 48:16.280]  He said, I'll come on at 1230. My time is 1130 our time. And he's so sick right now.
[48:16.280 --> 48:22.920]  He's trying to decide whether he's going to come on. He said, I saw him terrible. But I really want
[48:22.920 --> 48:26.760]  to say all this. And I understand I've been through what he's been through. It's real. It's not fun.
[48:26.760 --> 48:33.080]  It's next level. We'll see if he's with us next hour. But he was on fire despite this totally
[48:33.080 --> 48:39.720]  pissed off and told me he's going to see CNN who did say that he ran January 6th. I'm talking about
[48:39.720 --> 48:46.600]  horsemaner and the rest of it. And he's going to send us the photos of the Secret Service when
[48:46.600 --> 48:51.240]  they came to this hotel room and tried to lead him to the Capitol. And he said, the Secret Service
[48:51.240 --> 48:55.080]  doesn't do this. That's when he's like, this is a trap. Let's get the hell out of here.
[48:56.040 --> 49:03.160]  Far from running some attacks. So he was on fire. Last night when I talked to him, I asked
[49:03.160 --> 49:07.640]  three o'clock yesterday before I did my show yesterday evening afternoon. So we'll see if he
[49:07.640 --> 49:17.880]  joins us. Let me get back to Brian Stelter. So Brian Stelter does this eight minute report. I'm
[49:17.880 --> 49:21.080]  not going to air the whole thing. I'll air a few minutes, but it's the same repeat over and over
[49:21.080 --> 49:26.840]  again saying it's just insane. Lynn Beck has written this book and Tucker Carlson doesn't
[49:26.840 --> 49:32.920]  even question him about there's an elite using the lockdown to get rich. That's ridiculous.
[49:32.920 --> 49:36.520]  And that it's a war on little people. Yeah, that's why the small businesses is open
[49:36.520 --> 49:42.200]  or closed. Everything else is open. That's bot store. And then Beck does the same thing I just
[49:42.200 --> 49:46.920]  did messes up what he's saying. And he goes, this is the best read. I mean, the best book I've written.
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.720]  He goes, oh, look, you didn't write it. You ghost wrote it. Which I can tell you with Glenn Beck,
[49:51.720 --> 49:55.240]  he probably wrote a lot of it and had somebody put together in quotes and then did have some of
[49:55.240 --> 50:00.120]  it finished up and edited. But that doesn't matter. The point is he's exposing I've read the synopsis
[50:00.120 --> 50:04.920]  I've read the book yet, the whole globalist operation, how they did it, what's unfolding,
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.840]  you name it. And so instead of addressing any facts or any real things in the book,
[50:10.840 --> 50:15.880]  he just says it's made up like, oh, with no evidence, Glenn Beck has got this book about the
[50:15.880 --> 50:24.360]  great reset. And it's number one, of course, because it's just made up thinking you're so dumb,
[50:24.360 --> 50:28.360]  or his listeners are, that they won't go to the Davos group and hear Claw Schwab say,
[50:28.360 --> 50:33.320]  we are imploding the economy to end industrial world. Soon you own nothing. Soon you have nothing.
[50:33.320 --> 50:39.160]  Soon microchip on the skin. Let's see what head of Pfizer say. Pfizer talks the same way, like
[50:40.200 --> 50:45.240]  a cartoon character. Yes, you put the chip inside the shot that way we tracked them.
[50:45.240 --> 50:52.200]  So good. We took over the body. I mean, that's a new clip. I had it. Oh, we run them. We do it.
[50:52.200 --> 50:58.280]  Oh, but the worst part is him saying, oh, there's no evidence anyone made money off this. Look at
[50:58.280 --> 51:03.880]  this article right here. It's on info wars, but it links to all the documents. Wealth of 10 richest
[51:03.880 --> 51:08.120]  men double during pandemic incomes of 99% of humanity dropped. That's even in the New York
[51:08.120 --> 51:18.680]  Times. No one's denying that except except Ryan Stelter. So let's go ahead and go to a clip of
[51:18.680 --> 51:25.320]  Brian Stelter engaged in just again, the definition of lying, the definition of gas lighting. Here
[51:25.320 --> 51:30.600]  it is. Falsehoods about COVID-19 and vaccines are flying from every direction right now. And
[51:30.600 --> 51:34.840]  I want to show you what I mean. If you take a step back and think about it, the COVID-19 pandemic
[51:34.840 --> 51:39.880]  is a chance for salesmen to sell fear. Take the unvaccinated Glenn Beck who's been shilling his
[51:39.880 --> 51:44.440]  new book while sick with COVID. He went on target Carlson show and kind of made me think a ghost
[51:44.440 --> 51:51.880]  writer had actually done the book for him. Listen, Tucker, this is the most important book I have
[51:51.880 --> 51:58.200]  read. This is the most important or that I've written. Okay. So he says he wrote the book
[51:58.200 --> 52:01.640]  and it's full of proof that global elites are conspiring to reshape society and crush the
[52:01.640 --> 52:06.120]  little guy. So here's what's amazing. Tucker doesn't ask a single question. He just listens
[52:06.120 --> 52:10.920]  while Beck claims that officials in Washington state are meeting to set up an internment camp
[52:10.920 --> 52:16.280]  implying it's to punish people who won't get COVID vaccines. I'm serious. Beck literally says this.
[52:16.280 --> 52:24.680]  This is an internment camp. Washington state has done it before. They haven't obviously learned
[52:24.680 --> 52:29.960]  their lesson from world war two. So Tucker just sits there and listens respectfully while Glenn
[52:29.960 --> 52:34.280]  implores people to buy his book. And sure enough, the book is number one on Amazon right now because
[52:34.280 --> 52:38.520]  fear does sell. And after the interview, Tucker thanks his guests and calls the book amazing
[52:38.520 --> 52:42.360]  and horrifying. And then he says just briefly, just gently that he's heard about this Washington
[52:42.360 --> 52:46.600]  state conspiracy theory and he has to verify it. Back this up 20 seconds.
[52:49.560 --> 52:55.880]  Notice he says he even showed his book like he showed his penis on here. Oh,
[52:55.880 --> 53:01.560]  Beck showed his book. Ooh, he showed a book. That's that's like the baddest free speech.
[53:01.560 --> 53:09.000]  Oh, and oh, fear sells. You know, you mean truth sells telling the truth in a world of
[53:09.000 --> 53:14.440]  universal deceit is a revolutionary act towards our well. I mean, the vaccine is sold on fear.
[53:14.440 --> 53:19.240]  It's not a vaccine. It doesn't work except making you sick. It's on record now that it
[53:19.240 --> 53:24.840]  raises your immune system just like top experts 22 months ago warned. And Mr. Potato Head
[53:26.520 --> 53:33.880]  is sitting up there literally acting like this is all made up. I have a stack of articles about
[53:33.880 --> 53:38.120]  the internment camps. It's all over the world. It's happening. It's everywhere. They're putting
[53:38.120 --> 53:42.440]  people in them. And now they want to bring putting us in the camps, the quote, quarantine camps.
[53:43.400 --> 53:46.840]  12 states have bills. Washington states already implemented it.
[53:47.480 --> 53:51.640]  They're announcing they're going to deputize anyone they want in the government to quote,
[53:51.640 --> 53:57.080]  take children away from the unvaccinated. That's in the health department announcements by the
[53:57.080 --> 54:03.880]  state of Washington, Mr. Super Potato Head. And you think people are so stupid, they can't go look
[54:03.880 --> 54:09.560]  it up here. Brian, let me show you some of these. This is nonsense. Dr. Blass, Fox,
[54:09.560 --> 54:14.840]  Glenn Beck for false COVID story. Oh, it's false, huh? Interim occupational consideration
[54:14.840 --> 54:19.000]  for implementation of the shielding approach to prevent COVID-19 infections and humanitarian
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.440]  settings. And this is exactly what is in the legislation and exactly what's been implemented
[54:24.440 --> 54:28.280]  outside of it with an emergency order by the governor in Washington. It's not a conspiracy
[54:28.280 --> 54:31.880]  theory. It's on local news. They building all these giant facilities and they built them all
[54:31.880 --> 54:36.760]  over the world. We have the head of the UN rapid reaction force Dr. Ryan saying it a year and a
[54:36.760 --> 54:42.280]  half ago and now it's here. FEMA documents describe large-scale rural isolation and quarantine
[54:42.280 --> 54:48.280]  operations, how to recruit obedient Americans to help round up dissenters. This is now coming out
[54:48.280 --> 54:57.240]  in FEMA documents. Look it up and it goes on and on. But here's the worst part. It's a town hall
[54:57.240 --> 55:03.240]  article linked to Rasmussen. National poll, 48% of Democrats want to put anyone that hasn't had
[55:03.240 --> 55:09.160]  the shot in a camp. 30%, let me show you, want to take people's children that haven't had it.
[55:12.440 --> 55:16.040]  I mean, go read it for yourself. I covered this for an hour last night on the Sunday show.
[55:16.680 --> 55:20.120]  It's a town hall article. We'll link it in the live show feed so you can't miss it.
[55:20.120 --> 55:24.440]  Poll reveals astonishing percentage of Democrats support unparalleled COVID
[55:24.440 --> 55:30.360]  tyranny from vaccinated in designated facilities in camps. And it says for your behavior,
[55:30.360 --> 55:34.680]  like Djokovic, okay, you don't have it. You have natural immunity. We told you come here.
[55:34.680 --> 55:38.200]  We held you for a couple of weeks and a thing. Then they let him out to create more suspense.
[55:38.200 --> 55:41.240]  Then they kick him out and say, well, that's because you didn't take the shot. We don't
[55:41.240 --> 55:47.400]  like that political statement. Which again, we're locking you back up before you leave for a few
[55:47.400 --> 55:51.640]  days because we don't like what you said. And that's what they do in Australia. They say, well,
[55:51.640 --> 55:57.080]  if you're in a COVID camp and you misbehave or talk back, you get an extra two weeks each time.
[55:57.800 --> 56:02.920]  So now, oh, it's not, you're not really here for COVID. You're here to learn to be reeducated
[56:02.920 --> 56:09.080]  to behave yourself. Like Hillary said, six years ago, five years ago, we need camps for American
[56:09.080 --> 56:15.240]  men to reeducate them. Oh, and here's another one. Utah's largest newspaper calls for unvaccinated
[56:15.240 --> 56:22.520]  Endur Draconia lockdowns enforced by the National Guard. Go read it for yourself. Noam Chomsky,
[56:22.520 --> 56:27.000]  all of them saying the same thing. CNN. Oh, Europe's now going to lock up the unvaccinated,
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  take their kids. It's wonderful. So CNN's got articles about, oh, look at Europe. They're
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.400]  getting smart. Look at Australia. Lock everybody up. This is what we need here. And meanwhile,
[56:35.400 --> 56:41.960]  Skelter's on TV going, I'll tell you, Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck, they're up there just
[56:41.960 --> 56:48.680]  making lies and look, they're number one. Tucker's number one on TV. Glenn Beck's got the number one
[56:48.680 --> 56:55.960]  book. Oh, it's crazy. We tried to shut down Alex Jones and it's like we cut a starfish in pieces
[56:55.960 --> 57:01.560]  and it just grew more starfish. That's right, you little sack of filth. You lying little piece of
[57:01.560 --> 57:06.120]  garbage. We were learning who's who. Beck wasn't bad. He just couldn't believe it was this bad.
[57:06.120 --> 57:10.840]  Now he's on board. Same thing with Tucker Carlson thought I was nuts. Apologize to my face years
[57:10.840 --> 57:15.960]  ago and said you were a trailblazer. Well, saw it first. Same thing with Joe Rogan. I don't want
[57:15.960 --> 57:23.800]  the credit. I want to beat these people. Yeah, there it is. Bill Washington. Bill will authorize
[57:23.800 --> 57:31.080]  a strike force to send unvaccinated to internment camps. It's not a rumor. Stelter. I need your
[57:31.080 --> 57:34.360]  support. I need you to take these videos, these articles and share them. All I got to you. All
[57:34.360 --> 57:38.200]  you got to me. We're in a war together and we are the black sheep. We're the tip of the spear,
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.920]  my God. We're doing our most important work ever. So go to infowarstore.com while you still can
[57:42.920 --> 58:09.400]  before they swat team me and walk me in a gulag and help support us.
[58:09.400 --> 58:15.960]  Reset Wars is a game changer. You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead
[58:15.960 --> 58:21.560]  of just as a victim. So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy,
[58:21.560 --> 58:25.800]  and makes us depressed and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there. When they feel
[58:25.800 --> 58:31.960]  their lie, cheat, steal, plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an awakening. Reset Wars has
[58:31.960 --> 58:39.000]  helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep rooted psychological tactics that
[58:39.000 --> 58:45.480]  were being used against me and now I'm not scared anymore. I have to say I was blown away. I feel
[58:45.480 --> 58:49.800]  so much better every day listening to it. To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course
[58:49.800 --> 58:55.560]  together. You're absolutely right. We are reflections of God. We are emanations of that
[58:55.560 --> 59:00.600]  and we can use that God energy to do really anything we want to do in this life. Romans
[59:00.600 --> 59:05.800]  chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind and that's a process.
[59:05.800 --> 59:10.680]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious. Most people go through their day and don't think
[59:10.680 --> 59:15.000]  about many things. You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[59:15.000 --> 59:20.840]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort physically and mentally to reprogram
[59:20.840 --> 59:26.360]  that subconscious mind. That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind because there's
[59:26.360 --> 59:32.680]  a war on for our mind. He's exactly right and he's become a great voice in our generation and in this
[59:32.680 --> 59:36.600]  new great awakening and I encourage everybody out there. If you haven't gone there yet,
[59:36.600 --> 1:00:06.440]  go to resetwars.com. That's where your journey begins.
[1:00:06.600 --> 1:00:30.440]  We got Roger Stone on the line. He's coming up next segment. Here's a key Gregory's report.
[1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:40.680]  Please share it. This big Roger Stone knows. The FDA out nanoparticles into the food supply
[1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:45.320]  under the generally recognized as safe because they claim that they are no more dangerous
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:49.720]  than their larger counterparts. Titanium is generally safe. Therefore,
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:56.440]  nanotitanium must be safe. But they also admit that known materials can exhibit new or altered
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:01:02.920]  physiochemical properties at nanoscale dimensions, including unknown safety hazards that they will
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:09.560]  continue to monitor for. In other words, the human trials for consumable nanotechnology
[1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:15.080]  is currently happening in the public without their knowledge. Nanoparticles can be absorbed
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:20.760]  into our immune defense system and into our bloodstream. And just like the FDA admits,
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:26.680]  materials at the nanoscale can cause unknown changes in a person's biological system.
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:31.480]  Animal studies have proven that nanoparticles are changing the way our bodies absorb certain
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:37.720]  minerals, such as iron. FDA chemist Timothy Duncan wrote that nanotechnology in the food
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:43.800]  supply is being held back because the food supply industry is afraid of public backlash
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:50.600]  and argues that nanotechnology will somehow make food healthier. The FDA is far more concerned
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:56.120]  with pushing more of these experimental nanoparticles into the food supply than they are with safety.
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:01.080]  Like they said about giving the dangerous experimental vaccines to your kids,
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:05.160]  we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is until we start giving it.
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:11.320]  At least 20 products are adding laboratory-made nanoparticles into the ingredients,
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:16.280]  and they are getting ready to coat bananas in new nanotech. But companies are not required
[1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:23.400]  to disclose nanosized ingredients, so we don't know how prevalent it is. Along with being a
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:29.240]  proponent of population reduction, forced vaccinations, and genetically modified foods,
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:35.800]  Bill Gates is also the biggest private farm owner in America. Does anyone doubt for a second
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:41.640]  that Bill Gates is allowing this dangerous nanotech the FDA is pushing for into America's food
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:49.160]  supply? In related news, 10 out of the 19 states in which Bill Gates owns farmland, along with at
[1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:54.840]  least another 10, have recently made it legal to dispose of human bodies into the municipal
[1:02:54.840 --> 1:03:02.040]  water supply, allowing human remains to be added into biosolid-sourced fertilizer. It's called
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:08.680]  alkaline hydrolysis and is referred to in pop culture as being very, very green. Spiritual
[1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:14.680]  leaders have strongly objected to alkaline hydrolysis because they say it is disrespectful to the human
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:21.080]  body, the vessel of a divine soul. And it's understandable why they say this. In alkaline
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:27.240]  hydrolysis, the human body is liquefied with lye and poured down the sewer to mix in with the
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:33.880]  community's excrement. And if that weren't bad enough, this biosludge is then collected from
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:40.760]  municipal water treatment plants and used as so-called fertilizer on factory farms. The official
[1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:46.840]  excuse is that it saves the government money for expensive toxic waste disposal. Meanwhile,
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:52.840]  we are all being sold food that has been grown with a toxic biosludge made up of human remains
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:59.720]  and excrement, which is then loaded with new and strange nanotechnology. Interestingly,
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:04.120]  the dystopian movie Soylent Green took place in 2022.
[1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:10.200]  They're making our food out of people. The next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle
[1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:17.320]  for food. You gotta tell them. You gotta tell them. Promise, Tiger. I promise. I'll tell the exchange.
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:24.840]  You tell everybody. Listen to me, Hatcher. You gotta tell them. Soylent Green is people.

[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:17.560]  Alex Jones. So in the last year, there have been thousands of news articles, conservatively saying
[1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:25.400]  Arrest Roger Stone and Alex Jones for planning the attack, which was a million people in DC,
[1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:31.160]  and a few thousand that got waved in by the police, and a few hundred that did wrongfully attack
[1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:34.920]  the Capitol Police, and it was a bad riot, and some people got hurt and died and it's terrible
[1:06:34.920 --> 1:06:37.960]  and we're against it, whether it was the cops getting beat up and hurt or whether it was actually
[1:06:37.960 --> 1:06:44.360]  bad, but it was horrible. But if you go back to six months and months ago, to August of last year,
[1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:50.360]  exclusive FBI find scan evidence, US Capitol attack was coordinated, and it goes on to have a senior
[1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:58.280]  FBI group in the Justice Department says they found nothing that Trump, Jones, or Stone coordinated
[1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:03.240]  or were involved in the attack. No, we were sitting there with our mouths hanging open. If anything,
[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:07.320]  Trump didn't act quick enough to, you know, to say shut it down. I was there as soon as I got there
[1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:10.760]  in the middle of it, I was bullhorning and saying stop and got a lot of people not to go in.
[1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:18.280]  So Roger Stone, it just is now battling COVID, but he he was on fire yesterday when I talked to him
[1:07:18.280 --> 1:07:24.280]  yesterday afternoon. So I begged him to come on today and I appreciate him coming on. He has some big,
[1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:30.200]  big announcements and I got to say just for survival, I've got to join him because I let
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:34.520]  him call me a Russian agent. I got spit on and coffee thrown on me and tea and stuff and my
[1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:40.920]  kids attacked at school to call me a Russian agent because that was bad enough. But now, now
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:45.400]  these publications are saying the same thing that, oh, Jones is definitely involved. Jones is
[1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:50.600]  running it. So I have a team of three lawyers here, separate ones. From my other cases we've
[1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:54.840]  got here, they're drawn at the lawsuits right now as well. We learned Roger is simultaneously
[1:07:54.840 --> 1:07:59.240]  because we got to get him into court and show people you're not going to just sit up here
[1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:03.880]  and say that I wanted to go burn up or blow up the Capitol and go to a super max prison and
[1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:07.800]  destroy the country. Why the hell would I want to do that? We had peaceful rallies all over the
[1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:12.760]  country and in DC. Our event got hijacked. I'm pissed. I want to find out who was involved.
[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:18.600]  We're trying to dig into all that right now and it looks like a mix of provocateurs and feds and
[1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:24.280]  actual idiots that wanted a violent revolution. But Roger Stone joins us to talk about who he
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:29.400]  is going after here today. Roger Stone, thank you so much for joining us.
[1:08:29.400 --> 1:08:36.200]  Alex, first of all, it's great to be here. And I guess right off the bat, I want to thank the
[1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:44.520]  thousands of people around the country who have been praying for my recovery in what turned out
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:54.920]  to be a much more difficult struggle with COVID-19 than I had expected. It is only by following a
[1:08:54.920 --> 1:09:03.720]  strict regimen of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and a vitamin regimen, including vitamin C,
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:15.400]  D, queratin, zinc particularly, and others. And for the help of some truly, truly gutsy,
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:21.960]  courageous doctors that I can finally tell you that I am back to work and feeling normal again.
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:30.280]  And this is truly horrific. And I had all of the worst symptoms, the fevers, the sweats,
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:39.720]  the cough, the congestion, the body aches, the mental fog. Tony Fauci and his red Chinese
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:48.680]  comrades did a superb job in the formulation of this bio-weapon. Thanks to George and to those
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:55.000]  who prayed for me. And thanks to Jesus Christ, I'm back in my feet and I'm ready to get back in
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  the battle. What's most, I guess, impressive to me is that I have new respect for Joe Rogan,
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:10.200]  who has had enormous courage of stepping forward and defending himself, knowing that the corporate
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:17.800]  media types would try to crush him as he speaks the truth about this virus, where it comes from,
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:23.080]  and how it can be treated successfully. I have new respect for Joe, I really do.
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:27.800]  So you're saying, you know, I've been obviously we talked about with doctors kind of this formula
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:32.600]  of success. Rogan expanded it and helped get it out to billions of people and that's helped
[1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:36.120]  save a lot of lives, absolutely. And he knew they'd come after him, but he did. I told people a
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:40.120]  year and a half ago, Joe was awake, he's going to come after him, and I told you folks and he did it.
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:46.920]  Look, I don't know if all of his politics agree with all of mine, but on this issue,
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:51.880]  as well, of course, is on the issue of cannabis legalization. I totally agree with him. What he
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:57.080]  did was very courageous. He knew they'd go after him. He knew they'd try to shut him down,
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:03.560]  but he did was right. I honestly think this man saved thousands and thousands and thousands
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:06.680]  of lives. I think a little more than that. I think this shows to save hundreds of thousands
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:11.160]  or millions. You probably saved tens of millions. So Roger, let's let's kick off here. You got a
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:14.680]  lot to say about Trump next segment. I know we want to keep away. You got your energy because
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:20.360]  you barely talk the last few days. I learned I learned a lot during the time that I was sick.
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:28.360]  I learned that yet again, there are irresponsible elements in the fake news media who are recycling
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:36.200]  this notion that I had either advanced notice or some involvement in the illegal acts of January
[1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:46.120]  6th. I spoke it to legally permitted events on January 6th. I did have a voluntary security
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:53.640]  detail from the Oathkeepers as did all of the other speakers at that conference.
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:12:01.720]  They were courtesy of those running the legally permitted events. The fact that I came in contact
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:09.240]  with these individuals proves nothing. The claim by let us take one right off the top,
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:15.960]  Bill Palmer at the Palmer report. Mr. Palmer is going to be sued for $10 million
[1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:23.560]  defamation in the California courts. If he thinks this is a joke, if he thinks I won't do it,
[1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:30.760]  he's wrong. See you in court. Bill, bring your checkbook. In your case, I have so many counts
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:37.560]  of defamation, the number will probably end up being much larger because you haven't been cautious.
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:43.880]  You haven't speculated that Roger Stone's a Russian spy, which of course also would make it
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:54.760]  not true. But as senior FBI officials confirm to the Reuters news service, the FBI found no evidence
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:13:02.600]  whatsoever that Roger Stone or Alex Jones was involved in a conspiracy to commit any illegal
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:11.160]  act on January 6th. So, Mr. Palmer, it's your turn. Produce your proof to the contrary. Produce
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:19.080]  your witnesses to the contrary. There are none. You're going to be writing a huge check, Mr. Palmer.
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:28.840]  I for one can't wait. While I'm at it, however, there's a miscreant at CNN, a former prosecutor
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:36.920]  named Jennifer Rogers. She says that DOJ appears to have Roger Stone in their sights.
[1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:41.880]  Okay, Jennifer, you're going to have your chance in the courtroom to prove that because in fact,
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:48.840]  they have proven that there's no thing against me. I'm coming after you. You say I need to pardon,
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:54.120]  I say you're going to need plastic surgery with a mug like that, but you're going to be writing a
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:14:02.760]  check. I've reached my saturation point, Alex. It's time to fight back. So let me put any journalist
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:10.600]  who wants to go step up right on notice. If you accuse me of being involved in any illegal activity
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:17.640]  on January 1st, 6th in Washington, DC, you will be met with a lawsuit. If in the past,
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:25.320]  you have accused me of being a Russian trader, you will also be faced with a lawsuit. So lawyer up,
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:31.720]  liberals, I'm not turning the other cheek. I'm coming for you in a court of law.
[1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:35.960]  Roger, we're going to go to break and come back and talk more about this and where this is going.
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:39.720]  And for a lot of our listeners, they say, Alex, we know you guys didn't attack the Capitol. We
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:45.000]  know we're tired of it. But the Democrats are running on January 6 and saying all their opposition
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:51.080]  are terrorist and literally trying to say we're kingpin mastermind terrorist. People need to know
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:57.880]  that this is a serious issue. And Tucker Carlson gets it. So many other people get this now,
[1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:02.440]  Tulsi Gabbards, that this is a big issue. Even Mitch McConnell says they're trying to brand
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:07.400]  the Republican Party as terrorist and run on that. So this is a big, big problem. We need to stand up
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:13.720]  to this. You're absolutely right. Let's hit it on the other side because I think it's time to go on
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:21.720]  offense. I'm tired of being a punching bag. Adam Schiff's a perfect example. He changed testimony
[1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:30.680]  in the January 6. He needs to be expelled from the House and he needs to be referred for prosecution.
[1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:34.360]  In the next Congress, he will be if he's even there.
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:39.320]  Thank you for those points. We'll be right back with Roger Stone. Roger, what's the best website
[1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:45.240]  for people to find out all everything you're doing? StoneDefenseFund.com is the place I need
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:49.640]  health. These lawsuits I'm going to file cost money. And we've got to do it. My coffers to bear
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:53.800]  just defending myself. But you got to do it. You got to do it. We're in a war, folks. Please
[1:15:53.800 --> 1:16:01.000]  support Roger. We'll be right back. Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:06.680]  been the buildup for what the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive.
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:10.840]  This is their takeover. And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now
[1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:14.680]  they've revealed themselves. Now their world government, their permanent martial law,
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:20.360]  their medical tyranny is out in the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed. But
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:25.160]  they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling
[1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:29.400]  the truth. So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:33.880]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear. And when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:37.400]  you keep us on air. Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months
[1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:44.200]  that are back in stock, 50% off, X2 and Winter Sun. Both of these are on our top five best sellers.
[1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:48.440]  They are so good for your body. And if there's two things you do for your body, it's these two
[1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:53.480]  products. They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:55.560]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[1:16:55.560 --> 1:17:04.360]  In late August, infowar saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:10.760]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:16.040]  and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:19.400]  something that's important to have. It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have,
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:24.760]  taking care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:29.640]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in. Now, we're ready to ship
[1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:35.640]  to you within 24 hours of your order. It's high quality. It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com
[1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:40.200]  because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food
[1:17:40.200 --> 1:17:45.000]  supply price increases that are already taking place. So lock in your storable food now at a
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:51.720]  lower price and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com. That's how you fight the great reset is by being
[1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:56.520]  self-sufficient and not under their control. So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:25.160]  The farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican
[1:18:25.160 --> 1:18:28.760]  rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:33.400]  sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:37.720]  the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas
[1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:46.600]  Rebels, literally. In fact, I'm not going to tell you the whole story. You wouldn't believe it.

[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:17.480]  Alex Jones. Well, I talked to Roger about a week ago and he could barely talk and he said,
[1:20:17.480 --> 1:20:22.200]  man, I really hope I make it. I've never been this sick. I said, I know I got Delta. That's
[1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:27.000]  probably what he got. There's Delta and Omicron going around and it felt like a gorilla was on
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:32.200]  my chest for two weeks, almost killed my dad. My dad has bounced back 90% but mentally he's still
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:37.640]  not where he was. Towards Glenn, Roger didn't die. This is a very serious bio weapon. They scanned it
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:41.880]  two years ago and they knew it was a bio weapon. Fauci made it. That's all come out in court.
[1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:45.960]  That's a whole other subject. I want to hit a little bit in the next segment of Roger has the
[1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:51.080]  energy but he's definitely fired up even though he's gasping for air and I understand the feeling.
[1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:55.800]  We appreciate your toughness, Roger. But just pulling back here, imagine calling us Russian
[1:20:55.800 --> 1:21:00.040]  agents and getting away with it and now they're saying we want to do a tactic capital, absolutely
[1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:04.760]  no evidence. Shouldn't we talk about and you probably want to correct the record. Did you give
[1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:10.600]  two speeches on January 5th and then no speeches on the 6th or maybe you did? I just remember we
[1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:15.560]  couldn't get to the crowd. There was a million people outside the hotel. It took me almost an
[1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:19.800]  hour or more to get there through the crowd. It was hellish and you just said screw this. It's
[1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:24.040]  not safe. I'm staying back. That's what I remember our conversation was and then the secret service
[1:21:24.040 --> 1:21:28.440]  came to get you to take us to the capital just like they did me and you've got photos by the way
[1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:32.360]  that you're saying you're going to release in court now of those secret service because you
[1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:37.240]  want to prove indeed it was them because you knew secret service doesn't do that type of thing. So
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:42.200]  for the record, tell folks what really happened on January 6th.
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:47.880]  It'd be very hard for me to say because of course I wasn't on the ellipse, did not march.
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:54.440]  No, I meant with you. You were just, yeah. I spoke at two legally permitted events on the 5th.
[1:21:54.440 --> 1:22:01.320]  One at the Supreme Court building in front of the Supreme Court building sponsored by Virginia
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:08.600]  Women for Trump. It was a legally permitted event. You can see video of my comments at no time did
[1:22:08.600 --> 1:22:16.680]  I call for lawlessness or violence or anything of the kind. I did call for a 10-day delay in the
[1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:23.000]  voting of the electoral votes. Listen carefully, Democrats. That's called constitutionally protected
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:32.840]  free speech. That's political activity. The right to assemble is also guaranteed by the
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:39.320]  Constitution. We have an absolute right to question the results of the election.
[1:22:39.320 --> 1:22:48.520]  It's constitutionally protected free speech. I spoke that evening at Freedom Plaza to an
[1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:54.280]  enormous crowd. I know you spoke that night as well. I posted that speech at YouTube.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:00.360]  YouTube has now chosen to remove that speech from my YouTube feed. Why?
[1:23:01.960 --> 1:23:07.960]  I have other copies of it. It proves that at no time did I make any inappropriate remark
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:12.840]  calling for violence or insurrection or... And by the way, let me just add, they're pulling
[1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:16.600]  my speech at the Capitol trying to stop the violence everywhere because they don't want the
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:25.240]  truth out there. It is absolutely true. As far as January 6th is concerned, I went out in front
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:33.000]  of my hotel still on the hotel grounds in the morning. The vermin at ABC News. These people
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:39.800]  are not journalists. They are the lowliest propagandists I've met in 40 years in American
[1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:49.080]  politics. Use a technique of guilt by association. Oh, Stone was identified with this man who was
[1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:55.960]  later arrested for trespassing. Hey, ABC, that proves nothing. You're getting sued, too. Get
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:24:03.640]  online. But beyond that, I returned to my hotel room and I was there for the rest of the day
[1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:12.680]  until I left at around four o'clock. If there was a war room in the Willard Hotel, I am unaware of
[1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:19.400]  it. I was in my room. I was in a room that you were using as a studio where I came by to just
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:27.080]  shake hands and meet General Flynn. And we had a brief but social conversation. No, we didn't
[1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:34.040]  discuss any illegal activities at the Capitol Clean for the next day. And I was in the lobby.
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:40.600]  Those are the only rooms that I was in. So journalists write that Roger Stone was in a
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:46.600]  war room in the Willard and you're going to get slapped with a defamation suit very quickly.
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:52.280]  And let's go forward with this. Bannon calls his show The War Room named after your previous show
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:59.080]  here with Owen. And he had a show called War Room. You and Bannon are not buddies. And I see all
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:04.440]  over the news that, oh, Stone was in a war room plotting with Bannon. They don't even check basic
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:11.240]  facts. It's like saying Batman and the Joker hanging out. Yeah, I wouldn't be in the same room
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:14.760]  with Steve Bannon. And it wouldn't really be dangerous because you'd smell him
[1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:18.760]  long before you got there. Well, let's not be, I don't want to end fight here. My point is you
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:24.280]  guys aren't working together on January 5th or 6th. There's no end fight. There is no end fight.
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:31.720]  He perjured himself at my trial. He told the House Intelligence Committee under oath that he and I
[1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:39.080]  never spoke about WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, or the WikiLeaks data. And he told the grand jury
[1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:44.920]  in my trial the direct opposite. That's called perjury. He will be held to account for it.
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:52.040]  All I'm saying is you weren't in a secret plan with Bannon. It's not some minor political squabble.
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:57.960]  I got it. I got it. Two way, two way for seven. It took for seven to nine. So Alex,
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:03.240]  men have to choose. You're on one side or you're on the other. It's not why I want to get off here.
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:06.760]  No, I hear you. The point is you were not in a secret conspiracy with Steve Bannon to attack
[1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:12.600]  the Capitol. Now there's, now there's understatement. Here, by the way, is a little historical fact
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:19.720]  that I think your listeners might need to know. Today is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:29.400]  What people don't know is that upon the murder of King, every politician aspiring to be president
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:37.720]  headed to Atlanta to get a photo op with Coretta King, Teddy Kennedy, Senator Eugene McCarthy,
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:49.080]  Bobby Kennedy, Dick Clark, Frank Church, and others. One man asked to see Coretta King privately.
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:56.760]  That was former President Richard Nixon. He flew to Atlanta and got a private audience with Coretta
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:04.040]  King in which he gave her an envelope with a check that paid for the entire college educations
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:12.680]  of all of her remaining children. He also did not want that information publicly released. Richard
[1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:21.960]  Millhouse Nixon. No press, he insisted. He wanted no press. He then marched to the Capitol with
[1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:31.960]  Wilk Chamberlain and went to the cemetery where Dr. King was buried. Richard Nixon wasn't looking
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:38.120]  for political benefit. He had had a very close relationship with Dr. King because the two of
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:45.080]  them worked closely together against Lyndon Johnson, that great Democrat, to pass the 1958
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:53.160]  Civil Rights Act. So today, as remember a great Republican, Dr. Martin Luther King,
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:59.240]  we should remember that quiet act of empathy and compassion from Richard Nixon.
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:03.720]  Absolutely. And we can, for TV viewers, amazing footage from that famous I Have a Dream speech.
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:09.160]  It wasn't terrorism when he got hundreds of thousands of people or more to march there for
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:13.720]  voting rights act and for civil rights. And it wasn't terror when we wanted to have the investigation
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:18.040]  of what was really happening with the election as Democrats that asked for four years before
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:23.240]  that's in the Constitution. So the idea they're trying to demonize speech and rallies and marches
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:27.640]  is wrong. The people in D.C., letting the government know that they're the majority
[1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.920]  and what they want is a good thing, right, Roger? Absolutely. True. Those who say
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:38.120]  questioning the election results is treason need to look at their own actions when they got beat
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:46.280]  by George W. Bush. Everything they are accusing us of is exactly what they did. So the hypocrisy,
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:50.840]  I think, is not lost on the American... Roger, I want to hit a few other issues with you. You've
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:54.040]  got the energy when we come back. There's so much to talk about with Roger Stone. Stay with us.

[1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:11.400]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:15.640]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out in
[1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:20.600]  the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate
[1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:25.720]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth. So listen,
[1:30:25.720 --> 1:30:29.560]  Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for the broadcast,

[1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:10.040]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now. And we have reformulated and not just

[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:19.960]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life. That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:27.800]  They must first play God. They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social
[1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:33.400]  Darwinistic system. And in a way, they're right. If we let them lie to us and dump us down and
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:38.680]  poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open. We
[1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:46.680]  really deserve what's happened to us. So I asked you now, are you going to step up and expose the
[1:32:46.680 --> 1:32:52.920]  new order even more? I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts. The front lines of
[1:32:52.920 --> 1:33:03.720]  the fight is infowarstore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's
[1:33:03.720 --> 1:33:22.440]  Alex Jones. Live from the infowarstore.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:32.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to be 110% honest with you.
[1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:38.920]  You want to piss me off? You say that I supported Donald Trump because I got money.
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:45.560]  All I got was lawsuits and deplatformed and lost money and almost got shut down supporting Donald
[1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:50.920]  Trump. But I supported him because he was getting us out of the UN, controlling the border, standing
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:56.120]  up at China, getting businesses back in America. He did such a great job the first few years,
[1:33:56.120 --> 1:33:59.800]  but he got obsessed with the Russia gate and defending himself, which I guess he had to do.
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:05.560]  And then it just got worse from there on out. And now the support of this poison vaccine,
[1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:10.040]  the rest of it. So I was talking to Roger yesterday who really likes the president,
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:13.960]  respects him. But behind the scenes say, yeah, I wish he'd do better here or there. I've really
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:20.360]  never heard Roger so upset as he was with Trump yesterday. And I said, well, you talked about
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:24.920]  this on air and he said, well, yeah, I'll talk about most of it. But we're really just worried
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:31.400]  about Trump. And let's just say this. He's not aging well. I don't mean physically. I mean,
[1:34:32.120 --> 1:34:36.760]  he's not going in a good direction. Now we got on him a little bit and the public did about
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:42.600]  pushing these shots and his speeches. He shut up about those. Now he's talking about REAPs and
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:48.520]  provocateurs on January 6th and false flags. So that's good. We want Trump to be successful. We
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:53.880]  want Trump to be a leader. We want him to be the big kingmaker that helps get other key Republicans
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:35:00.120]  elect around the country. But if he starts because whoever's advising him, bringing in some really
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:08.200]  bad Republicans and refilling the swamp with alligators and and with water moccasins and with
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:14.280]  rattlesnakes, well, then doesn't mean that we don't like that, you know, a lot of the good
[1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:20.280]  things he's done, but we have to morally come out against it. So Roger is here to respectfully take
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:24.120]  President Trump, who is, I believe, the real president, how the election is told from him,
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:29.000]  to the woodshed because no matter how good a lot of stuff he's doing, we have to speak out against
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.440]  what we're really concerned about. So Roger, thanks for being here today and please tell us
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:39.720]  so what as much as you can. Well, Alex, let me be as clear as I can. I love Donald Trump.
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:47.000]  The man saved my life. I first wanted him to run for president as early as 1988,
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:57.800]  then again in 2000, then again in 2012, then again in 2016. I saw in him something I still see,
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:05.320]  an enormous amount of courage, a brawler, a guy who's not afraid of a fight, a guy who will
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:14.040]  call it exactly who it, as it is, who wants men's words. I disagreed vehemently with his
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:22.280]  advocacy of this vaccination. I chose not to take it. No, I don't think I was ill because
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:29.560]  I didn't take it. I think I was ill because I wisely didn't take it, not because I didn't take it.
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:37.000]  I thank the good Lord that I'm here to talk about it. What perplexes me are some of his
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:47.400]  endorsements. He endorsed Congress Mario Diaz-Bellard of Miami. Donald Trump wouldn't know Mario
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:55.000]  Diaz-Bellard from the Frito Bandito. He has an undistinguished career in Congress,
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:00.760]  but here's one thing you can say for certain. He never voted for Donald Trump in a Republican
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:08.440]  primary. Or then there's Congressman Vern Buchanan of Florida. As a member of Congress,
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:14.920]  Vern has gotten multi-million dollar personal loans from foreign governments. He has also
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:26.280]  voted to keep us in the Paris Climate Accords. Voted for the J6 Committee. Vern Buchanan would
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:33.560]  steal a hot stove. He's not a Trump Republican. He's not an America First Republican. While
[1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:40.440]  there are so many good Republicans like Tom Norton of Michigan in the second district running for
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:47.240]  Congress who truly deserve the president's endorsement, why is the president wasting his
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:57.720]  firepower on Vern Buchanan? The woman he's endorsed in Wyoming won against Liz Cheney.
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:05.880]  She led the floor operation for Ted Cruz and Mike, pardon me, John Kasich,
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:14.040]  to try to deceit the Trump delegates at the 2016 convention. This woman is not a Trump supporter.
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:21.800]  She's an enemy. Why would the president endorse an enemy? These things just make
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:27.560]  very, very little sense to me. I know a lot about Donald Trump, probably more than most. I've known
[1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:35.080]  him 40 years. I know how he thinks. He's one of the smartest men I know, yet he continues to support
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:45.880]  those who bear him ill will. The Republican National Committee raised $2 billion. Do you
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:52.440]  know how much of that money went to election integrity or examining the results of the election?
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:39:05.160]  Zero. None. Nada. Why did General Michael Flynn, Patrick Byrne, and others have to go out and
[1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:10.920]  raise the money for an extraordinarily well done audit done by Jovan Pulitzer,
[1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:15.240]  easily one of the most intelligent scientists I have ever met,
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:23.480]  that money should have come from the Republican National Committee. So here today, now, I appeal
[1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:29.800]  to anybody who's listening, find me someone who's given a sizable contribution to the
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:36.280]  Republican National Committee so we can file a lawsuit for a full audit of all funds,
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:44.120]  soft and hard. Let's see who got the money, because the money did not go to helping elect
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:52.120]  Donald Trump, and therein lies the pity. Why is Trump always surrounding himself with his enemies,
[1:39:52.680 --> 1:39:57.400]  and why is he endorsing so many bad people? Because, I mean, he just has bad advisors?
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:05.720]  It's a question I wish I could answer, Alex. I don't until I see him and I will have an opportunity
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:14.440]  to see him directly, but let's take Ana Polina Luna. There is no such person. Ana Polina Luna is
[1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:20.920]  not Hispanic. She ran for Congress using a picture of her with an assault weapon wearing
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:28.280]  military fatigues, and she said, quote, until you have spilled blood for this country, you can't
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:35.720]  understand the fight for freedom. Ana Polina Luna never served in combat, and her stint in the
[1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:42.680]  Air Force was not 16 years, it was six months. So she should replace Senator Blumenthal's Senate seat?
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:51.240]  Yeah, I know she would be perfect with Luna. By the way, in Florida, it is specifically a felony
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:59.880]  to raise money wearing a uniform. This woman never saw combat. She never served her country in combat.
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:05.320]  She is not Hispanic. Big, big, big future news coming about her.
[1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:07.240]  Well, she is attractive. What is she?
[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:10.520]  Say it again, please.
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:12.680]  She is attractive. She's not Hispanic. What is she?
[1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:18.920]  Well, it's an excellent question. Her last name is Meyerhofer. That's her real name. It's on her
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:28.440]  driver's license. She is not Hispanic. Don't confuse her with Luna Lopez running for Congress
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:32.360]  in the Jacksonville district. Also, was that Luna Lopez we had up on there?
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:41.640]  Yeah, perhaps. No, that was Ana Polina Meyerhofer, Beausberger, Myruwitz, or whatever her real name
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:51.000]  is. Not Hispanic, not Hispanic. Luna Lopez is running against Congressman John Rutherford,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:55.640]  easily the single most attractive woman I've ever seen in my life. And of course,
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:04.040]  that's a political judgment by which I say that. But again, Rutherford's a rhino.
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:14.760]  Luna Lopez deserves his endorsement. I doubt that she will get it. There is the woman who
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:22.040]  claims to be a military combat veteran. There's the woman who says, quote, until you've spilled blood
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:28.200]  for your country, you can't understand the fight for freedom. While you and Ana didn't spill blood,
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:33.240]  you never saw combat duty. Your husband died, but you need to tell him to stop wearing his
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:39.880]  medals on his suit. It isn't done. It's incorrect. All right, Roger, I know you got to go, but we
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:43.400]  got to go to break. I want to ask you about the Democrats saying counterterrorism is what
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:47.720]  they're running on, that white conservatives are the new terror threat, and how you see that playing
[1:42:47.720 --> 1:42:53.240]  out the next 295 days to the midterms, and how you think they're planning to counter the fact
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:59.480]  that a massive political realignment has happened. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk
[1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:04.040]  to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick
[1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:09.080]  and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing
[1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:15.240]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, Supermail Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:20.440]  together. You're an unstoppable tank. Supermail Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:27.240]  herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared
[1:43:27.240 --> 1:43:31.880]  to powdered versions that also work quite well that just aren't as strong. This is like a very
[1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:36.840]  fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just
[1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:40.520]  okay. People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:46.360]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:57.880]  strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it. Cognitive
[1:43:57.880 --> 1:44:03.800]  dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:09.720]  refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:15.800]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com. Studies have suggested that
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:21.960]  fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:27.640]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:34.200]  responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:40.840]  and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity
[1:44:40.840 --> 1:44:47.800]  of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about
[1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:53.880]  actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member,
[1:44:53.880 --> 1:45:01.400]  or yourself at InfowarsStore.com. If your ruthless mega corporations have taken over almost every
[1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:07.000]  government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of operability,
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:11.320]  you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted. And that's
[1:45:11.320 --> 1:45:17.240]  why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT and African American rights,
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:21.960]  all the rest of it, all over the world. That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:27.000]  in Africa and in communist China and many other areas, while they undermine our basic liberties
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  here and spy on us through the big tech and the central banks and other zone. So this is a criminal
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:40.200]  takeover and when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media,
[1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:44.280]  it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress and their staff and their families,
[1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:51.400]  it's the White House, hell it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:55.880]  the general public and everybody else through corporate rule. So this is the true discrimination
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:46:02.600]  that's going on. It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:07.640]  even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:13.080]  government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:18.520]  and what you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:22.840]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:27.640]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount. That's why
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:33.320]  everybody should visit InfowarsStore.com. We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant

[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:21.480]  I should have mentioned Mike Lindell of MyPillow. They've got him all over the news as a mastermind
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:26.760]  criminal with Jimmy Kimmel saying he'll soon be in prison. He used to be joining us. I love how
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:31.320]  we're all planning this overthrow of the US government by having a bunch of people walk
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:36.040]  between the velvet ropes inside of the Capitol and a few people getting fights with cops. It was
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:41.640]  not good. We don't endorse it. But the idea that that's how we stage a coup. No, we stage it by
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:48.680]  getting voters awake to vote their ass out like we did in 2016. That's what we do. But Roger,
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:59.320]  please, 295 days out, handicap the 2022 midterm so key and what dirty tricks you think the left
[1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:03.160]  are going to pull because they're obviously running on their opposition or terrorist.
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:07.240]  Even Mitch McConnell had to come out last week and say, responding to Biden, you're now seeing
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:11.720]  the Republican Party is the domestic enemy. So it's pretty clear that I think we're entering
[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:16.120]  the season of false flags as a before October surprise. What do you think?
[1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:24.200]  Well, their real problem is they have no issue to run on. They certainly can't run on gasoline
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:33.480]  prices. They can't run on the abundance of food. They can't run on their stellar foreign policy
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:41.960]  victories around the globe. So they have to run on some kind of false flag issue. My guess is that
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:49.800]  you will have a new pandemic of some kind, which will require that no in person voting can be done
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:58.680]  at all. And all voting will have to take place by mail. That that's my that's my doomsday scenario.
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:04.920]  I think that is what they will try. Whether the American people will put up with that or
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:12.040]  whether the states will adhere to it is a large open question. They cannot win based on the numbers
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:19.160]  today. I read an excellent study recently showing that among Hispanic voters for the first time
[1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:25.320]  ever in American history, they divide evenly between those who favor Republicans and those
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:32.280]  who favor Democrats. Joe Biden promised us civility would return to politics. Instead,
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:39.800]  all he has done is deify anyone who disagrees with him as a trader or a domestic terrorist.
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:47.800]  No, we have a constitutionally guaranteed right to disagree with you. We have a constitutionally
[1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:53.960]  guaranteed right to speak in opposition to what you say. We have a constitutionally guaranteed
[1:49:53.960 --> 1:50:01.400]  right to gather in groups and agree with each other. We do not advocate violence. We do not
[1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:07.480]  validate its losslessness. You're the one who uses those things. I want to know more about this
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:15.400]  poor woman who was murdered in the tunnel between the US Capitol and the Senate office building.
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:22.600]  I want to know the name of the officer who killed her in cold blood, who bludgeoned her with a
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:31.240]  night stick. Are you proud of this, Joe Biden? Are you proud of this, Nancy? I find it repugnant.
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:39.080]  The only people died on January 6 were unarmed Trump supporters. And when CNN says it was the
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:47.960]  bloodiest day in American history, it shows you what we all know. Nothing reported by CNN is true.
[1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:54.520]  As you know, I don't get my news from CNN for the same reason I don't eat out of the toilet.
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:51:03.720]  But who would have thought that Chris Cuomo would be gone from CNN? And Don LaMone has
[1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:13.080]  put halfway out the door, I assure you. We need the truth about Roseanne Boyland and her death.
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:22.360]  Every single American needs to see this horrific video. This woman was stomped and beaten to death
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:30.920]  in cold blood. That is not all right in America. No police officer has the right to do this. A
[1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:39.400]  grand jury needs to be charged. A special counsel should be appointed. If it isn't done by this one,
[1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:46.920]  it will be done by the next one. She cannot have died in vain. It's just wrong.
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:54.280]  Well, it's a terrible situation and very, very sad. Roger, I know you have to follow these lawsuits
[1:51:54.280 --> 1:51:59.240]  and so do I. I'm not a litigious person, but I have to start suing the people that are saying,
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:03.960]  Alex Jones, mastermind will soon be in jail for attacking the Capitol because, I mean,
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:09.320]  it's a lie. And you talk about defamation with malice and forethought and tend to do harm.
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:15.000]  They say, we want him in jail for 50 years. We never want to see him again. And then lie about me
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:22.360]  and then show footage of us months before in the Georgian capital in Georgia, going in with Vernon
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:26.600]  Jones and getting everybody, you know, the cops are like, don't be loud. We're like, okay, yes, sir.
[1:52:26.600 --> 1:52:30.920]  And we get the whole crowd and take our photo all peacefully. And we did it a bunch of other places.
[1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:37.880]  And then they use those shots and say, here they are training in the days before in the Capitol,
[1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:42.520]  in the US Capitol. And these people, we send them letters and tell them, and they go, screw you,
[1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:46.200]  we're going to keep saying it. And these are so-called leftist journalists. Well,
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:49.960]  they're going to get sued. I'm not going to say the names, but they know who they are. The lawyers
[1:52:49.960 --> 1:52:54.600]  are across the street reading all their substack stuff, all of it. So I'm going to sue big national
[1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:58.520]  people and I'm going to sue the mid-level people because they got to learn. You're not going to
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:03.000]  lie about me trying to put me in prison, you little jerks, just because you get off on it. You're
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:10.040]  going to pay. You know, it's funny, Alex, several times during the coronavirus, there were times
[1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:15.320]  when I started coughing and I just couldn't stop. It was spasmatic and couldn't stop coughing.
[1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:21.640]  It was really horrific. But there was one time when I started laughing and I couldn't stop laughing.
[1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:29.560]  It's when the fact checkers at Politico said that Ray Epps is not an FBI informant. I couldn't
[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:37.800]  stop laughing. I just couldn't stop laughing. Be very clear, nothing reported on CNN is accurate
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:43.880]  or true. Absolutely nothing. Now, some people are there among those, are going to be among those
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:51.080]  getting sued and they're going to pay up because none of them can prove. But Ray Epps is without
[1:53:51.080 --> 1:53:59.560]  any question a Russian informant. And the fact that Politico says otherwise is absolute stone cold
[1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:07.400]  legal proof that he is. Hey, Epps, sue me. Come on, sue me. I'll prove it in court. Want to go
[1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:13.960]  that way? I'll go that way too. But Alex, this is a change for me. I'm tired of being on defense.
[1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:19.800]  I'm tired of having to come on and in for wars and beg for people to support my legal defense,
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:26.760]  to defend myself. Now, help me go on the attack. Now, help me go after these people,
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:34.360]  drag these mangy, unbathed, disgusting leftists into a courtroom and sue them and make them pay
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:41.640]  for what they have done to me and my family. Once again, this month, we're going to be short
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:53.320]  because I'm still fighting 11 baseless, groundless harassment but highly sensationalized lawsuits.
[1:54:53.320 --> 1:54:59.240]  Now it's your turn. To any journalist or activist who wants to say in the public forum
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:05.320]  that I'm a Russian traitor or that I was involved in any way in any illegal activity
[1:55:05.320 --> 1:55:11.480]  on January 6th, you will get a lawsuit. Laugh it up all you want. See you boys in court.
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:16.680]  Roger Stone, StoneDefenseFund.com. Thank you, Roger. We really appreciate it and I'm glad
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:22.520]  you're getting better. God bless you, Alex. Thanks for having me. The fight continues.
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:26.200]  Absolutely. All right, let me just say this before Mike Lindell comes up.
[1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:30.680]  Roger's not perfect. I'm not perfect. Mike Lindell's not perfect. Trump's not perfect,
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:36.200]  but I can tell you this. We're the men in the arena and we're being attacked and examples are
[1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:43.480]  being made out of us because we are in the arena for you because you see, I'm not stupid.
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:49.240]  I know if my children are going to have a good future, yours got to have one. My promotion of
[1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:54.840]  your freedoms and your liberties is because I am a selfish person. And of course, it's
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:56:00.200]  instinctive. I have agape. I have brotherly love. I care about everybody. I love people. I'm a
[1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:09.400]  giving person, but that's the mindset. I actually care about people, but if you look at society
[1:56:09.400 --> 1:56:15.560]  and civilization, it's that type of attitude that builds a civilization. Not one of let's screw
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:21.480]  everybody over. Let's be cheats. Let's be liars. So I'm in the fight of my life right now and I've
[1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:25.480]  got to file a law. I don't just have to defend these lawsuits that are rigged in certain courses
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:30.520]  with certain cases and it's all political. We can sue in other jurisdictions that aren't and we can
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:35.080]  win and we've got it cut and dry that I didn't plan the attack on the Capitol or all this stuff.
[1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:39.160]  We got to follow a few of those, but that's not what I really need the money for. I need money to
[1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:43.640]  keep this operation going and to fight the Democrats that are trying to shut us down. So that's why
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:49.880]  I say go to infowarstore.com or call toll free triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:54.840]  nine. And yeah, we were supposed to end the sale last Thursday. Hopefully today I'll get the time
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:58.680]  to cut the new ads for some products that came back in. But Vitamin Refusion is selling out
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:04.200]  probably today. X2 is going to sell out by the end of the week. They're both still 50% off and Vitamin
[1:57:04.200 --> 1:57:10.760]  Refusion sale will end today. 50% off infowarstore.com. And then yes, we're going to have soon back on
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:16.200]  the side winter sun and we also got a bunch of other key stuff that's been sold out for seven
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:21.000]  months because the supply chain breakdown is back. It's been back for a couple of weeks. I've just
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:24.760]  been so busy I haven't got ads for it or put it on the shopping cart. So I want to thank you all
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:29.320]  for keeping us on air without you. We would not be here. We'll never back down. We'll never give
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:34.680]  up. But we could give out also get COVID land part to the mask and get two of my films free. The
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:39.080]  order of death and dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove. That sale is going to end in two weeks.
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:53.560]  We'll be right back with our number three inside you, like me, fire is burning. Something needs
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:57:59.400]  to change. I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to reset wars. It's really powerful.
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:07.000]  Reset wars was absolutely amazing and eye opening and revolutionary. If you want to change your life
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:12.280]  for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex. Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[1:58:12.280 --> 1:58:19.400]  I found it to be awesome. It was worth it to me. You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge
[1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:25.240]  and crystallized it with scientific. This isn't about Alex Jones. So what you're about to see
[1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:32.520]  is a lengthy, powerful, well documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding
[1:58:32.520 --> 1:58:37.960]  that the power structure is censoring and is definitely afraid to think the way we are intended
[1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:43.320]  to think by God. That's what this series is about. Reset wars has been a great tool during this time
[1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:50.760]  of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated my hope. It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's
[1:58:50.760 --> 1:58:55.320]  going on in my life. Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the
[1:58:55.320 --> 1:59:02.440]  information far and wide. There is an awakening. Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[1:59:03.160 --> 1:59:07.800]  Reset wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know
[1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:14.120]  and also learn new material. I'm not disappointed. I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:19.320]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more. It's moving me. We need to
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:24.760]  have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like I got a lot of that from
[1:59:24.760 --> 1:59:31.480]  Reset Wars as well. The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless. This isn't magic.
[1:59:31.480 --> 1:59:38.280]  This is the real code of the universe or what Max Plank 120 plus years ago called The Matrix.
[2:00:01.800 --> 2:00:11.000]  All right. Mike Lindell that the mainstream media is seeing as a terrorist mastermind is joining us
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:15.960]  coming up here on the other side of the spree. But I wanted to play a clip of Texas Congressman
[2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:20.520]  Troy Niels who was going to be on the January 6th committee but they wouldn't let any real
[2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:24.360]  Republicans on it pointing out the elephant in the room that they were told there'd be an attack
[2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:28.760]  the day before so they ordered half the police to leave but a thousand FBI sat there in plain
[2:00:28.760 --> 2:00:35.080]  clothes and watched the outmanned overman police be overrun showing premeditation.
[2:00:35.080 --> 2:00:38.440]  Here's a local Dallas television WFAA talking about it.
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:43.160]  That's send me audio.
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:48.680]  Missouri County is outside Houston and he spoke to us from his office in Washington.
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:53.880]  Congressman welcome to the program here. Speaker Pelosi accepted you to be on the committee and
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:01:00.040]  three other publicans for the Republicans as well but when Pelosi rejected two of your colleagues
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:05.080]  that's when minority leader Kevin McCarthy pulled everyone off. Do you think that was a mistake
[2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:11.000]  by not giving you a voice? No I don't believe so. And first off Jason thank you for having me. No
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:20.360]  what happened is Speaker Pelosi had her pick. She chose eight and leader McCarthy had the ability
[2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:28.120]  to select five. He selected five with with Mr. Banks and Mr. Jordan and I and others
[2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:34.440]  but when she rejected two is what she did is she rejected all five. In the history of this
[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:44.200]  institution in over 230 years never it's never happened where the speaker has rejected the picks
[2:01:44.200 --> 2:01:50.840]  from the minority. It's never happened before so she really quite honestly when she rejected two
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:56.440]  she rejected all five. Congressman you said that I read that you said that you reviewed
[2:01:56.440 --> 2:02:00.520]  a Senate report you and your staff did and discovered things in the report that are alarming
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:05.240]  and need to be investigated. What are some of those things? Number one the Capitol Police the
[2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:10.520]  senior leadership of the Capitol Police had an enormous amount of intelligence. They just didn't
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:18.120]  share it with people. There's a January 3rd report that was so conflicting I mean and it was an
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:23.800]  intelligence report it was the last report that they actually disseminated but they only disseminated
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:29.800]  to the leadership of the Capitol Police. That's why Mr. Dunn that one of the officers he he thought
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:34.520]  what is happening here this is this was supposed to be January 6th was supposed to be no different
[2:02:34.520 --> 2:02:40.920]  than any other demonstration so no that report says at the end of it now it's it's several pages
[2:02:40.920 --> 2:02:47.640]  maybe 15 16 pages at the end it talked about their intelligence showed that that the Capitol the
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:54.360]  Capitol building was going to be on the radar the Capitol building they were coming to the Capitol
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:59.480]  they talked about extremist organizations and groups they mentioned the proud boys they mentioned
[2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:04.520]  old keepers there was an enormous amount of intelligence Jason but it wasn't disseminated
[2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:08.600]  and it wasn't shared because if I would have been the chief of police at that point in time on
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:14.760]  January 3rd and I saw that report I would have had the National Guard activated ready to go on
[2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:20.120]  January 4th they would have been here on the 5th and they would have been here on the 6th. Could
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:24.840]  you have done that though without the White House approval? You don't need the White House approval
[2:03:24.840 --> 2:03:31.080]  what you need is is it's called the Capitol Police Board which is made up of the two sergeant at arms
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:36.120]  okay the two sergeant at arms and the architect of the Capitol so I think the chief of police would
[2:03:36.120 --> 2:03:41.640]  have shared that information to those gentlemen Mr. Irving and Mr. Stanger I think they could have
[2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:49.800]  got that done and ultimately yes you would work with the DC Capitol the DC National Guard
[2:03:49.800 --> 2:03:54.040]  General General Walker you would have had the guard here on the 4th they should have been here on the
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:59.480]  4th Congressman I want to switch gears in the final moments here too Democrats and Republicans in
[2:03:59.480 --> 2:04:05.800]  the Senate reached a bipartisan deal on the infrastructure proposal proposed by President
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:12.840]  Biden you obviously sit on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure I'm curious
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:18.200]  based on what you're hearing there on Capitol Hill do you support this well what you do Jason
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:23.720]  this is what I do know you hear a lot of things I haven't seen the text of the bill I don't know
[2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:30.120]  exactly you know there was there was a we saw some a picture on the lawn a couple weeks ago where
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:35.560]  President Biden came out and said he had a he had Republicans and Senate and Democrats working
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:40.600]  together on a bipartisan infrastructure bill but I haven't seen the bill and we're going to
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:47.000]  go to break Mike Lindell joins us on the other side he has been debanked uh American one American

[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:29.480]  an actor pretending that Mike Lindell had been put in prison because he was questioning the election
[2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:35.160]  that's their big push and they is his great office manager with their thousands of employees
[2:06:35.160 --> 2:06:42.360]  sent us Friday the actual bank recordings of their banks saying sorry we can't have anybody that
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:46.680]  might be under FBI investigation well same thing happened to us a couple years ago it happened again
[2:06:46.680 --> 2:06:51.880]  a few months ago that's why I tell listeners this is hellish and and the persecution is just
[2:06:51.880 --> 2:06:56.440]  incredible so he's here to talk about that he's here to talk about the j6 committee trying to

[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:06.840]  even happened yet which again running scared like Nazi Germany the deplatforming happened online
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:11.880]  now it's happening with banks and businesses that support America Americans must galvanize against
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:19.000]  this we need congressional and legislative action don't we against this absolutely you know what it
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:23.640]  needs we need and I actually had brought a year ago I had brought it to the president but I didn't
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:29.480]  we did it was too little too late to have a law where you can't go after people because of what
[2:09:29.480 --> 2:09:34.600]  they believe politically that's crazy that you can that you can do all these things do you know
[2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:41.000]  Alex a year ago with over a quarter million people were deplatformed not just Donald Trump on his
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:48.520]  Twitter that was on YouTube Vimeo Twitter Suckabuck's Facebook all these platforms even some a lot of
[2:09:48.520 --> 2:09:54.200]  churches were deplatformed because they said things that they believed in and it's disgusting and
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:09:59.880]  it's just it's every day they try to they're trying to suppress our voice they're trying to keep our
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:06.360]  voice down and I want to encourage all you them your watchers listeners to you guys you go out
[2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:12.120]  there you might have a hundred friends or 500 friends or 5,000 whatever you got you email them
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:17.720]  and you and you call them and you do this on a daily base and tell them the real news that's
[2:10:17.720 --> 2:10:22.680]  going on the stuff that we all need to hear about that you're not hearing on your terrible news
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:27.880]  outlet Fox News because they don't talk about anything that's going on they're not going to
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:34.280]  tell you that my that the bank got have canceled me you know wouldn't that be news that a company
[2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:40.200]  you know and a charity and a network that's helping addicts the bank wants to cancel them
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:46.280]  that should be headlines on Fox News you know and just show exactly that's how the left plans with
[2:10:46.280 --> 2:10:50.840]  a social credit score to impoverish us and take control of us this is what Hitler first did
[2:10:51.400 --> 2:10:56.840]  when he got in power the first five years was take his political enemies banking away
[2:10:56.840 --> 2:11:01.640]  and then you know what happened next this is really dangerous yeah it's very dangerous
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:08.760]  and I'm you know it's I'll give an example last year and this is a maybe a little bit of no not
[2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:12.680]  as good example but when they were canceling the box stores and when they were canceling
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:17.160]  in the shopping shelves I didn't tell anyone this back then because it was it was kind of a
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:23.960]  scary situation 12 TV stations came to me and said we're we're not gonna we're gonna sit this one
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:30.840]  out Mike we're gonna watch your ads right now and I said if you cancel my ads and then you're
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:35.480]  never coming back I gave him a choice that day it was almost a year ago today and I said you
[2:11:35.480 --> 2:11:41.560]  got a choice to make Alex they made the right choice now those stations are flourishing my pills
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:46.680]  they're number one selling products but the point I'm making is if they would have started that
[2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:51.000]  all TV might have piled on and said we don't want to do we don't want to deal with them
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:55.720]  you know what I mean well this is the same way with this bank this needs to be stopped in its
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:12:01.720]  tracks and thought tens of thousands of people we put the we put the we had the we played the
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:07.960]  recordings on our platforms which we can Minnesota's a one a one recording law where you we were
[2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:14.520]  able to put these recordings out of what these bank what this bank said and then we put their phone
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:19.480]  numbers up people thousands of people called the bank they went there they're I think there's even
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:24.760]  people they're running around the parking lot today said don't you dare do this because you're
[2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:28.440]  what are you gonna start something what about somebody that doesn't have a voice Alex and
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:32.360]  they get their bank account canceled because well I mean that's the whole leftist plan is this
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:36.360]  incredible bullying and that's what I tell stations everybody and I've noticed leftist bullying
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:41.000]  against this show most of the time when leftists threaten our radio stations they put us on more
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.800]  and that's the American spirit we're not built as Americans to give into bullies and we've been
[2:12:45.800 --> 2:12:50.680]  giving into political correctness too long it's time to stand up for my pillow and stand up for
[2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:54.760]  frank speech and stand up for invoices and if we don't we're going to lose it all folks
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:13:02.600]  yep yeah absolutely absolutely and every and people have responded I believe I tell people
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:07.400]  we're better off every day people see well how are we sitting Mike I said every day I feel better
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:12.440]  than the day before with all the all the stuff that's happening now with the 2020 election all
[2:13:12.440 --> 2:13:16.840]  the laws are changing you know all the all the stuff that's going to become a house of cards
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:22.840]  they had of all those crimes come crumbling down but more importantly is our communications we're
[2:13:22.840 --> 2:13:28.760]  all on to the big fake news outlets we're on to that and we're even getting on to the fact that
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:34.440]  the ones that don't talk the the conservative media that's doing more damage by not talking about
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:40.200]  stuff that's out there and so but they have we have all these other platforms now with the
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:45.240]  frank speech dot com and and you're in for all these places that people are going for information
[2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:51.640]  now and and even their own smaller podcasts and everything Alex people are communicating and the
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:57.400]  truth is breaking through out there and and that's what encourages me it really gives me I was at
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:03.320]  the rally yesterday in Arizona and there seemed like there was 60,000 people it was amazing what
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:08.200]  he's just talking about the big Trump rally and there was Trump talking about ray apps and the
[2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:12.680]  false flag exactly they're not going to blame you and I and I guess I talked to you about this
[2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:17.320]  off air you didn't even know that's why they're subpoenaing you with January 6 they're in the news
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:22.040]  trying to act like that that we're all in some conspiracy to attack the capital that is just
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:30.120]  preposterous we never talked about any of that well Alex if you know last year on on June 25th
[2:14:30.120 --> 2:14:35.960]  the FBI came out with their report after January 6 of four or five month investigation said there
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:43.480]  is absolutely no conspiring between Donald Trump or his followers whatsoever that's they said that
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:49.480]  the FBI said that they cover their own tracks but you know that's either here or there but here they
[2:14:49.480 --> 2:14:55.240]  are this has all been election deflection it's all a bunch of garbage a year later this little
[2:14:55.240 --> 2:15:01.880]  committee they set up on January 6 they subpoena Verizon to get my phone records I'm not going to
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:06.280]  take that I got nothing to hide there they could you know I'd said to my lawyers well give it to
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:10.920]  them that I don't care I got nothing I that I I tell it like it is and they and then they go
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:18.280]  no Mike and I said you know what I said let's just sue them so we did well that's the thing is if
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:22.840]  it was a real committee and part Republican I would go for it but they wouldn't let the
[2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:28.440]  Republicans put any of their real members on it it's totally staged all right one more segment
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:36.760]  with Mike Lindell I want to ask him about the 2022 midterms now only 295 days away and I told him
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:40.600]  when he was saying six months ago hey we're going to overturn it now I said I don't know that's going
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:44.520]  to happen but I said regardless of the work he's doing and through the states and through the
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:48.200]  audits and now the laws that are going to pass they're going to stop the next deal and that's
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:52.760]  what I know is going to work and Mike Lindell and my pillow has been the very tip of the spirit
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:58.680]  has been attacked for it that's why you should really support them I've been fighting as hard as I can
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:05.560]  for almost 28 years against the globalist I wanted to stop their agenda I wanted to wake up the world
[2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:11.320]  and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:17.720]  are awake yes we're not getting caught flat-footed but they are going ahead with their full operational
[2:16:17.720 --> 2:16:22.840]  the industrialization great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers
[2:16:22.840 --> 2:16:27.640]  and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:32.200]  ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:36.200]  we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality

[2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:34.920]  at the hiccups all of a sudden a dramatic music is making me do that uh Mike looking at the mid
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:39.800]  terms looking at what we've discovered about election fraud looking at poll numbers as you know
[2:20:40.680 --> 2:20:45.160]  in republicans and democrats showing more and more of a majority 80 percent of republicans
[2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:51.080]  40 percent of democrats on the average poll believing there was election fraud all of
[2:20:51.080 --> 2:20:56.680]  their demonizing you and trump and others that have questioned it has not made the public think
[2:20:56.680 --> 2:21:05.320]  that biden really won and then his terrible his terrible policies and his terrible delivery has
[2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:10.040]  really turned people off he has the lowest global rating of any presidents and polls were taken
[2:21:10.040 --> 2:21:14.120]  what are your predictions and what do you want to say about the mid terms that we are accelerating
[2:21:14.120 --> 2:21:18.520]  towards well i'm going to give everybody some hope here i'm going to tell you where it's all
[2:21:18.520 --> 2:21:24.680]  sitting with because obviously i've said it before if you got machines in our computers in 2022 you
[2:21:24.680 --> 2:21:30.040]  lose your country forever that's reality i don't care what anyone said that's reality but the good
[2:21:30.040 --> 2:21:35.800]  news is we have uh great things going on right now remember we still have the supreme court
[2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:41.640]  complaint i was just with uh egs over the last week they've got all their changes done i don't
[2:21:41.640 --> 2:21:47.800]  know exactly when uh it will be coming out but that's that will take care of when they turn it
[2:21:47.800 --> 2:21:53.000]  when they come uh supreme court looks at that they one of the biggest things the relief there is
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:59.880]  so none of these states do what they did in 2020 means they can't have you can't have a law in
[2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:04.920]  michigan where a governor says send out seven million uh empty ballots or everybody can't
[2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:11.480]  bypass the legislature thanks to everybody putting on the fact that is correct that's one thing
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:16.280]  now we have another thing if you go to frank speech dot com we form the cause of america
[2:22:16.280 --> 2:22:21.480]  we're like a hub to all these other grassroots groups in the country i'll give an example the
[2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:30.680]  one to defend florida uh dot org they've they've canvassed 20 000 names and 4 200 of them came up
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:35.720]  as uh phantom voters which means that they just use their names on the voter rolls everybody
[2:22:35.720 --> 2:22:41.400]  and this is in florida so there's remember there's 3000 some counties in the united states
[2:22:41.400 --> 2:22:46.920]  we're going county by county we i was just uh yesterday we spent 12 hours with the new
[2:22:46.920 --> 2:22:54.840]  replacement system which is paper ballots on steroids basically amazing this uh and in fact
[2:22:54.840 --> 2:22:59.880]  i think i have one here but uh or it's in the other room uh but i see now the system works it was
[2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:07.640]  developed by x military and very smart it people and but it's paper combined with cameras amazing
[2:23:07.640 --> 2:23:13.400]  system so we're going to go county by county to get the these replaced so you don't use these
[2:23:13.400 --> 2:23:20.600]  machines that are defective alex there's a lot of big two huge lawsuits coming out one of them is
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:25.720]  they did not preserve evidence in all the lawsuits the frivolous lawsuits where they
[2:23:25.720 --> 2:23:32.680]  sued over 200 people including my pillow and mike lindell dominion did and smartmatic well
[2:23:32.680 --> 2:23:37.880]  combined with those lawsuits the judges now that we have what they didn't preserve it's because
[2:23:37.880 --> 2:23:43.560]  they didn't preserve evidence and and uh in these court cases well spoiling it's called
[2:23:44.200 --> 2:23:50.840]  spoilt now in a normal spoilt the jury says well you must have hit something that would have made
[2:23:50.840 --> 2:23:58.040]  you guilty alex we have what they did what they deleted so this is gonna it's over i'm telling
[2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:04.200]  everybody when this comes out and it's coming out this month it is going to be game changer okay
[2:24:04.200 --> 2:24:09.800]  but our big goal is now and all the states by the way the four big swing states could pull
[2:24:09.800 --> 2:24:14.120]  their select they're all working on pulling their electors down they could that could still happen
[2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:19.720]  it could happen any day wisconsin can pull theirs down over the racine county uh felonies that they
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:26.120]  sued uh the wack in wisconsin pennsylvania remember had more votes than voters what a law
[2:24:26.120 --> 2:24:30.440]  what a concept you can't turn in your electors when you have more votes than voters
[2:24:30.440 --> 2:24:36.200]  arizona it's easy i was just in arizona they could pull their electors down uh michigan and
[2:24:36.200 --> 2:24:44.120]  you also seen in georgia rad rassenberger has to look at uh the whistleblower in 242 people
[2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:49.960]  that went and harvested votes in georgia hundreds of thousands of them they got paid $10 a piece
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:55.640]  all this stuff is going on everybody you get to frank speech dot com you all the information is there
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:01.960]  these are great things going on all this is a huge thing it's gonna i went by august i wish every
[2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:07.640]  i'm hoping every single county in the united states does not have a machine we're gonna have the
[2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:13.240]  fairest election history but in the meantime the states could pull it down the supreme court can
[2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:17.800]  do it who knows what they can but they will do what i was about to say you know everybody
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:21.480]  because you've been fighting so hard especially you did it all yourself and things always take
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:26.520]  longer than than we want them to but we're getting a lot of traction right now and that's why their
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:31.960]  main issue is claiming we're racist and trying to block people that are brown from voting that's
[2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:36.120]  not what we're doing you can debate all day about these voting machines but they admit all the hackers
[2:25:36.120 --> 2:25:41.480]  admit anybody can break into them they're not secure so you don't send submarines down that
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:48.360]  have windows that are open it just it doesn't work we need to get to a new system right alex alex and

[2:31:53.400 --> 2:32:01.000]  prepared now at infowarstore.com it was almost 15 years ago that i released my seminal film in game
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:05.880]  blueprint for global enslavement and in that documentary i predicted the globalist would
[2:32:05.880 --> 2:32:11.640]  establish world government by releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns
[2:32:12.200 --> 2:32:17.560]  and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it how did i know
[2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:22.680]  they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and
[2:32:22.680 --> 2:32:28.040]  internal meetings were leaked you see then i was tracking the builder group who's head at the time
[2:32:28.040 --> 2:32:32.680]  was claus schwa and our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning
[2:32:32.680 --> 2:32:38.200]  to launch this great reset well we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the third world
[2:32:38.200 --> 2:32:43.480]  and the first world on its ass is the tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship
[2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:49.800]  no due process destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[2:32:49.800 --> 2:32:55.080]  of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us in the populace this is what info wars is
[2:32:55.080 --> 2:33:03.000]  fighting we're fighting for the future leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:04.520]  it's alex jones
[2:33:13.160 --> 2:33:15.880]  i got no friends because they read the paper
[2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:23.000]  they can't be seen with me from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:34.280]  i used to be such a sweet sweet thing so they got a hold of me i opened doors for little old ladies
[2:33:34.280 --> 2:33:41.880]  i helped the blind to see i got no friends i got no friends because they read the papers
[2:33:41.880 --> 2:33:51.160]  because they can't be seen with me and i'm feeling real shocked down feel like me
[2:33:55.320 --> 2:34:00.680]  it's the opposite i'm gonna be the nice guy during all this i was already mr. name before
[2:34:01.640 --> 2:34:05.560]  it'll be nice i don't want to hate each other and kill each other that's not the answer
[2:34:05.560 --> 2:34:12.440]  he's a c that tricks us to vulcanize okay um
[2:34:14.200 --> 2:34:21.480]  white house has come out and admitted false flag attacks exist that governments stage terror attacks
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:28.600]  that's that's coming up in a moment from our good little buddy the most arrogant woman i've
[2:34:28.600 --> 2:34:36.600]  ever seen jen sake and we got some background on it but first new reports been filed at man dot video
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:40.680]  are we witnessing the end of america just a few minutes long we'll be back
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:51.400]  america has been captured by very evil multinational corporate crime syndicate run out of the
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:56.840]  bilgerberg group and its public arm the debo script they are not intending to allow the
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:03.400]  population of the planet to continue on as it is to say the least and depopulation is what's
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:08.760]  been carried out through covert means through the so-called vaccine program and that's now
[2:35:08.760 --> 2:35:13.800]  coming out and mounting and then you ask the logical question how did the the the the
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:20.680]  technocracy engage in this mass murder that's now unfolding with these slow kill soft kill weapons
[2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:26.280]  how will they get away with that and the answer is further destabilization so horrible that you
[2:35:26.280 --> 2:35:33.800]  forget the last major insult to the human ecosystem so we are being treated as a disease as a cancer
[2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:40.120]  to be cut out and the big lie is people working for the system believe that they are positioning
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:45.000]  themselves with the winning team and that they are going to be taken care of because they are going
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:50.200]  to execute this operation when you read deeper into leak documents out of the debos group and
[2:35:50.200 --> 2:35:55.400]  bilgerberg group that we and others got great danger to ourselves you will then discover that
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:36:01.720]  they plan to implode all the western governments and then even have show trials of the bureaucracies
[2:36:01.720 --> 2:36:06.920]  that are going to engage in the initiation of the civil war that has already begun and not just
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:11.320]  here about other parts of the world so all the ministers in australia and ministers in the netherlands
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:17.080]  and the uk and the us that are doing all of this really believe their position because they went
[2:36:17.080 --> 2:36:22.440]  to the debos group school they went to the bilgerberg school um they have a school and that
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:26.520]  they're on the winning team but if you actually read some of the deeper stuff that they're not
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:30.520]  given no they're going to all be wiped out as well and i have a sense of being able to look
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:35.400]  myself in the mirror and a sense of that i'm starting to measure up to my ancestors that were
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:41.400]  pretty amazing people and that uh i didn't join these scum but that means i will be set up put
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:46.040]  in prison or killed very soon and let's just get down to i'll be honest about this with you okay
[2:36:46.040 --> 2:36:50.440]  i'll tell you this be dramatic we're at the end of the road here okay it's 298 days out from the
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:54.200]  election they're never going to let us have a free or fair one again and they're going to devalue
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:58.360]  the dollar they're going to get the country and uh you just need to get right with god and realize
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:03.800]  we're being judged for abortion i also want to say that i am not offensively as i've told you
[2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:08.760]  i'm going to be involved in any type of military operations you're going to obviously hear that
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:14.280]  when they say it's terror attacks they're already blaming myself and rush limbaugh posthumously
[2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:21.400]  in his case for the january 6 fiasco and the provocative false flag extravaganza we're supposed
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:34.360]  to be horrified by the protesters meanwhile four years of a coup launched in the oval office of
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:44.520]  barack obama to overturn the election results of 2016 and not a single word of concern about the
[2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:52.360]  potential damage to our constitution there's a reason 75 million people voted for trump there's
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:59.800]  a reason that when he made that trip down the escalator on june 5th of 2015 there is a reason
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:06.440]  that he had majority support in the republican party and that is the people that voted for
[2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:10.200]  trump know exactly what the left has been doing to our country it's nothing to do with race
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:14.360]  has nothing to do with white supremacy nothing to do with the white this or that
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:21.640]  it has to do with the left destroying western civilization and so i just i have to really
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:33.480]  just get down to brass tacks with you and say this is the end of the line okay
[2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:43.720]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's
[2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:51.080]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the
[2:38:51.080 --> 2:39:02.680]  front lines of the information war it's alex jones and that video is 13 years old that was in
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:08.840]  dallas texas dr crowd of 3000 and one of those old theaters that later tore down those old grand
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:15.160]  theaters and there i was saying that and seeing in last week had that quote that cut out in the info
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:24.600]  war it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and let the establishment know i don't
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:29.240]  know how this is going to end but if you want to fight you better believe you got one it's time
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:36.840]  for us to stand up with information with the truth in an info war and win i'm telling you the war
[2:39:36.840 --> 2:39:43.800]  is an information war we need to stand up with that in this fight and win and they edit it to
[2:39:43.800 --> 2:39:50.280]  take out info war to say it's time for humanity to stand up and fight if you want to fight but
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:54.840]  let it better believe you got one but see that's because they want to say burn down buildings
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:40:01.240]  attack police do all the things they do and then when we get up and say we're gonna fight back
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:05.880]  against us oh my gosh you're gonna attack us and kill us no i mean we're gonna fight back you know
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:10.280]  like the football team fought back and won the game or we fought back in the business deal or
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:17.800]  you know it's hyperbole i mean oh no we're sitting in a prison so they turned the temperature up in
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:23.560]  2019 and 2020 ahead of the election burned down billions of dollars of buildings and kill a bunch
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:28.440]  of people and shoot cops everywhere and then they get we get a million people in dc and they have
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:33.880]  the capital stand down with the federal government watching with thousands of troops we now know
[2:40:33.880 --> 2:40:40.200]  not giving trump the troops he wanted and then they get a few thousand people to get a little
[2:40:40.200 --> 2:40:46.440]  rowdy a few hundred to break in then the cops up at the doors and let in maybe a thousand people
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:51.160]  on the feds want to arrest every one of those people they don't want to arrest the folks attacking
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:41:01.720]  the courthouses with fire bombs because that's the agenda to brand the majority of the country
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:06.920]  when the majority of the landmass guys show people of democrat republican map of the u.s
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:13.720]  all the democrats have is some of the coastlines they don't produce anything they don't do anything
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:19.560]  they just sit there and point their finger at us and say those are nazis because they're white
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:27.560]  and then it's a bunch of old crazy white people that swindled their money they're the ones doing

[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:14.680]  organic in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:18.040]  that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:22.120]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:25.960]  take over so i actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years
[2:46:25.960 --> 2:46:29.640]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:33.880]  50 percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere

[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:19.480]  coming up start of the next segment
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:28.040]  we got a reyeps 2.0 caught on video the article watch man confronted for being removed from fbi's
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:35.320]  january 6 most wanted list it's pretty powerful see the full videos at info wars.com okay let's
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:41.960]  go ahead and get to this this is a big deal video biden admin says russia is going to carry out a
[2:47:41.960 --> 2:47:50.840]  false flag attack on itself to justify invading ukraine now i don't have any examples of russia
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:57.720]  staging false flags the czars under the communist i'm not defending communist it's just but the czars
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:03.720]  got caught a lot famously staging false flags uh and then arresting their opposition i guess there
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:09.400]  was the false flag of operation trust it was like q in the 20s when the bolsheviks had first taken
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:13.960]  over russia where they posed as the opposition and led the opposition to to go and get people to
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:20.440]  come join think and then put them in a gulag but the fact is the democrats and the corporate
[2:48:20.440 --> 2:48:25.640]  media and the gaslighters tell you nobody ever stages anything and so when we say hey they
[2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:30.920]  provoke her january 6 or they may stage something in the future they're like oh that doesn't exist
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:37.640]  but jim sake on friday white house press secretary the most arrogant woman i've ever seen she sits
[2:48:37.640 --> 2:48:43.160]  up there and says we have evidence without showing the evidence that the russians are planning to
[2:48:43.160 --> 2:48:49.720]  attack themselves so they have a pretext to go into ukraine now that is how world war two started
[2:48:49.720 --> 2:48:56.280]  was the nazi stage attacks on the german side and said the polls did it in operation himmler sub
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:49:03.960]  sub directive operation gliwitz or operation himmler uh and the sub directive sub operation
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:08.920]  gliwitz so i'm not saying the russians couldn't do this but from these liars like sake i don't
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:16.360]  believe word she says but there's the admissions that false flags exist here she is we have information
[2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:20.840]  that indicates russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false flag
[2:49:20.840 --> 2:49:26.600]  operation in eastern ukraine the operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:31.960]  to carry out acts of sabotage against russia's own proxy forces our information also indicates
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:36.760]  that russian influence actors are already starting to fabricate ukrainian provocations
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:41.240]  in state and social media to justify a russian intervention and so divisions in ukraine
[2:49:42.600 --> 2:49:46.040]  okay i mean russia might be doing that i don't have any evidence but the point is this is what
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:51.560]  goes on so they try to deny the ocean exist now she tells you about the atlantic ocean and how it's
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:55.880]  big deep and blue and has sharks living in it so wait a minute you said the ocean doesn't exist
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:01.880]  sake but oh oh now the russians so the ocean exists when she says it does but he but it
[2:50:01.880 --> 2:50:07.320]  doesn't when they say it does again the globalists want a war with russia they want a silence to
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:12.360]  sit here that's russia's turf over there if russia was involved in our business i'd be up there you
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:19.880]  know what like the chikoms are i'm on them and the left thought you know it was so cute what what
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:24.120]  what the russians were like when they were under their leftist control but now it's not so cute
[2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:28.680]  that's a real photo by the way with their a foreign minister live her off with her years ago
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:34.680]  in the obama administration so i wanted to show folks to see me on wikipedia operation northwood's
[2:50:34.680 --> 2:50:40.920]  the us government plan to bomb us city shoot up shoot up movie theaters to blame the russians and
[2:50:40.920 --> 2:50:46.520]  cubans and start world war three kennedy said no to the plan operation northwood so this stuff
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:53.160]  does exist it does go on and we should just stop denying that we got into vietnam via the gulf of
[2:50:53.160 --> 2:51:01.320]  tonkin and so much more now i've got all this other news i didn't hit but i want to go back to
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:05.080]  something was in the news yesterday because it's just too insane but we knew it was coming
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:10.280]  first it was us say today now i got picked up by yahoo news everybody's everywhere
[2:51:11.480 --> 2:51:17.480]  with a group connected to the un saying abolish parents their racist let the state raise children

[2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:36.840]  in the name of equity the name of equality and it goes on from there so my break and let this is
[2:51:36.840 --> 2:51:44.360]  the guy pushing it i mean this is the sabotage of humanity going on just like the covid vaccine is
[2:51:44.360 --> 2:51:48.280]  causing a financial collapse as they fire all these smart people that won't take it
[2:51:49.960 --> 2:51:53.320]  because they took the first one and got sick they don't want the second or third they're like oh
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:58.200]  take the booster i got so sick i'll get someone to quit oh things are collapsing too bad
[2:52:01.720 --> 2:52:05.560]  which is their plan it's all i got just figured it out today they've said this
[2:52:06.440 --> 2:52:12.840]  novak jokovich arrives back in belgrade sirbia after deportation from australia and all the
[2:52:12.840 --> 2:52:17.160]  reports i watched like a bunch of this morning three or four he deserves it he's a troublemaker

[2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:27.560]  deserves it he's a good boy this guy that the competition went on and trashed him
[2:52:30.520 --> 2:52:37.080]  it's us that make these events and if the sports people and others would start saying no they
[2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:42.360]  wouldn't be slaves in the system we need more people like jokovich we need a jokovich award
[2:52:42.360 --> 2:52:47.480]  for doing the right thing and saying no he's the one that's won that thing nine times in a row
[2:52:47.480 --> 2:52:53.080]  he's the one now france is saying he can't come to the next event either well good we need more
[2:52:53.080 --> 2:53:01.400]  of the tennis players to do it and he goes say no and jokovich could have gotten fake papers and
[2:53:01.400 --> 2:53:06.120]  said he took it he didn't do that we tell you the nfl that's what they do that's why no number nine
[2:53:06.120 --> 2:53:11.480]  but in europe they line up and they follow their orders and they do it university bar students
[2:53:11.480 --> 2:53:17.400]  from drinking water under covid restrictions in new york at fordham university always some new cult
[2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:24.200]  ritual you got to do don't look people in the eyes don't you know all this cdc suggestion to cancel
[2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:30.760]  football and band in nearly every u.s. school called unrealistic it's all just fear mongering
[2:53:30.760 --> 2:53:36.440]  you need the vitamins the minerals and to be healthy grand paul wonders if youtube will kiss my ass
[2:53:36.440 --> 2:53:42.680]  and apologize that the cdc admits cloth masks aren't effective and give you back to your pneumonia
[2:53:42.680 --> 2:53:47.960]  and probably spread covid or any other disease more than not wearing a mask because it lets the
[2:53:47.960 --> 2:53:53.720]  particular build up in a plaque in the mask and in water bubbles and then aerosolizes it better
[2:53:53.720 --> 2:53:58.520]  big new study out cdc forces say the mass do nothing but do you think the maskeys are going to
[2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:07.240]  stop it's their binky it's their baba it's their glee glee it's their little blanket those are names
[2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:19.400]  that my children had for their blankets glee glee binky and baba that's right my four-year-old
[2:54:19.400 --> 2:54:28.040]  uh his blanket is called glee glee the point is is that these masks are their glee glee ladies and
[2:54:28.040 --> 2:54:40.040]  gentlemen and it's so ridiculous and now we're torturing our children with these i saw this
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:48.200]  being sold in a store in austin little buddies by fiesta plush mask and when you turn around it's
[2:54:48.200 --> 2:54:54.520]  the face muzzle to teach them slavery on average a regular mass lowers oxygen by up to 20% increases
[2:54:54.520 --> 2:54:58.680]  carbon dioxide poisoning i figured i wonder what the lawyers had them right on the back and sure
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:08.200]  enough the big story is on the back it says care for your little buddy's mask if you have difficulty
[2:55:08.200 --> 2:55:12.920]  breathing while wearing your little buddy remove it immediately oh well we all have trouble breathing

[2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:40.040]  filter in it on top of it and then it's got all this other cloth on it and so your poor child
[2:55:40.040 --> 2:55:46.440]  is literally huffing through all of this with their little buddy let me see if i can breathe

[2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:09.640]  uh oh claustrophobia total and it's it's like just the cult programming is just ridiculous
[2:56:09.640 --> 2:56:14.840]  of how the system wants to abuse our children the system's run by a bunch of pedophile devil
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:22.120]  worshiping scum and they're sitting there telling you to put this big thick thing on their face

[2:57:47.080 --> 2:57:51.720]  hey infowars if you're like me you've been a long time listener of this program and you fed up
[2:57:51.720 --> 2:57:58.280]  with everything going on in the world inside you like me a fire is burning something needs to change
[2:57:58.280 --> 2:58:04.520]  and yet we feel helpless almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us
[2:58:04.520 --> 2:58:10.120]  it's time for us to break free from that system reset wars is a game changer you start to see
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:15.800]  yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim so much of the stuff we look at
[2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:21.640]  today is low vibration low energy and makes us depressed and therefore we manifest as negative
[2:58:21.640 --> 2:58:26.840]  reality out there when they feel they're lied to each steel plan to enslave and rob the people
[2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:34.120]  there is an awakening reset wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the
[2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:39.640]  deep rooted psychological tactics that were being used against me and now i'm not scared anymore i have
[2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:46.280]  to say i i was blown away i feel so much better every day listening to it to alex thank you very
[2:58:46.280 --> 2:58:51.720]  much for putting the course together you're absolutely right we are reflections of god we
[2:58:51.720 --> 2:58:56.920]  are emanations of that and we can use that god energy to do really anything we want to do in
[2:58:56.920 --> 2:59:01.640]  this life roman's chapter 12 paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind
[2:59:01.640 --> 2:59:07.240]  and that's a process most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious most people go through
[2:59:07.240 --> 2:59:11.640]  their day and don't think about many things you can drive along a long journey and not even remember
[2:59:11.640 --> 2:59:17.320]  half the trip in this process we need to have a concerted active effort physically and mentally
[2:59:17.320 --> 2:59:23.640]  to reprogram that subconscious mind that's what this series is about is resetting our mind because
[2:59:23.640 --> 2:59:29.640]  there's a war on for our mind he's exactly right and he's become a great voice in our generation
[2:59:29.640 --> 2:59:34.120]  and in this new great awakening and i encourage everybody out there if you haven't gone there yet

[3:06:35.320 --> 3:06:40.840]  start off with the markets well they closed today but they've been having a not a happy new year
[3:06:42.440 --> 3:06:49.160]  and there's a reason for it and that is interest rates are going up now let's go back
[3:06:49.160 --> 3:07:02.040]  to a year ago we had this guy the fed head uh Jerome Powell BS into everybody that um
[3:07:03.560 --> 3:07:12.360]  don't worry about inflation it's only temporary and then we heard him say it was only transitory
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:18.760]  or is it transgender sorry i'm not too sure because it's all BS anyway so we can make up
[3:07:18.760 --> 3:07:29.160]  anything we want and Janet Yellen was yelling it out as well there he is Powell Powell again you
[3:07:29.160 --> 3:07:36.520]  look at this fed scam before i go any further you got that little lowlife arrogant boy down there in
[3:07:36.520 --> 3:07:46.040]  texas yeah what was his name uh kaplan yeah crapplin play in the markets on the inside
[3:07:46.040 --> 3:07:53.240]  oh and i'm going to retire now play millions of dollars knowing what the fed was going to say
[3:07:53.240 --> 3:07:58.280]  and then playing it before they said it oh we got the guy up here in mascot two shirts over here too
[3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:06.520]  rose in grand oh i'm not feeling good now i think i'll retire too from the fed because i got caught
[3:08:06.520 --> 3:08:16.280]  doing inside dealing too and then another lowlife oh calm down salenti they're federal reserve yeah
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:23.960]  federal crap what's his name clarita clarita whatever his name is yeah the other fed head
[3:08:24.840 --> 3:08:27.640]  he just got caught playing the markets as well
[3:08:27.640 --> 3:08:37.800]  oh i'm gonna retire early i'm gonna remain i made my millions i'm gonna retire early
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:46.120]  and all you plantation workers of slave landia go back to work fed remember it was christmas time
[3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:51.320]  remember that i know we only have to talk about how retail sales did but it was about the birth
[3:08:51.320 --> 3:08:58.840]  of jesus christ yeah the jesus christ that made a whip and became violent to drive the money changes
[3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:09.240]  out of the temple yeah that's right the goldman sacks gang the merrill lynch mob the city grew
[3:09:11.880 --> 3:09:21.240]  same murderers yep became violent so don't tell me i shouldn't be angry when i see what they do
[3:09:21.240 --> 3:09:28.440]  into the people now just as they did it before so going back to the lying little powell they
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:33.800]  knew interest rates are going up they're keeping them low because they're artificially prop up the
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:42.360]  markets the bigs the bigs remember when i was a young guy a lot of years ago there were drug
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:49.560]  stores stationary stores hardware stores grocery stores screw the stores put all the little people
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:10:00.680]  out of business now we have chains grocery chains hardware chain stationary chain grocery chain
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:10.360]  chains all we are our plantation workers of slave landia into the chains because of these low
[3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:22.200]  interest rates there you go gone forever the low interest rates allows the bigs the black rocks and
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:30.920]  the black stones all these hedge funds private equity groups buying up everything when i was
[3:10:30.920 --> 3:10:38.200]  a young guy they didn't exist it borrowed money for nothing but nothing merger and acquisition
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:44.360]  activity last year 2021 heist on record stock buybacks yeah you buy back the stocks applying
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:54.120]  demand but yeah ten trillion dollars ten trillion dollars on the management one company
[3:10:56.520 --> 3:11:02.200]  the bigs are in control oh also do you see the latest numbers with the billionaires getting
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:10.280]  billions richer yeah so they know the interest rates they know inflation is going up they're
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:18.040]  artificially keeping interest rates low because these are the same line pieces of scum crap
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:26.200]  whether it's there we go ten richest billionaires double their wealth during pandemic and it wasn't
[3:11:26.200 --> 3:11:38.520]  a pandemic it's a lockdown by politicians anyway going back merger and acquisition activity stock
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:46.200]  buyback supply and demand brings the price of stocks up where do the little people put their
[3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:52.040]  money once upon a time you put it in a bank and you got interest on it screw you you're going to
[3:11:52.040 --> 3:11:59.960]  get a getting interest again these are the liars that i was saying that told us when inflation
[3:11:59.960 --> 3:12:07.160]  rate goes over two percent we're going to raise interest rates over two percent what is it in
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:16.920]  europe five percent and you got negative rates what is it in america 6.8 seven percent and you
[3:12:16.920 --> 3:12:25.800]  haven't raised it in a year going back to why the markets are going down because interest rates are
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:41.320]  going up but even if they raise them three times and bring in a 0.75 fed rate let's go back to
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:49.640]  where inflation inflation is over six point eight percent according to john william shadow stats
[3:12:49.640 --> 3:12:59.960]  is around 15 percent so what you actually have a negative interest rates the economy is not going
[3:12:59.960 --> 3:13:05.640]  to go down until interest rates i believe it above 1.5 percent and that might not happen this year
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:17.400]  as for inflation it's going to keep going and if you don't believe me look at oil prices
[3:13:18.680 --> 3:13:28.760]  Brent crude oil prices in 2021 were up 50 percent they went down a bit in late november
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:41.720]  and december but guess what they're back up again the jp morgan chase gang is estimating that oil
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:51.800]  may hit 125 dollars a barrel okay
[3:13:51.800 --> 3:14:01.080]  okay if it goes over 100 dollars a barrel you're going to see a replay of what happened
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:11.400]  back in 2007 2008 when the markets are going up oil prices are going up when over 100 dollars a
[3:14:11.400 --> 3:14:22.520]  barrel boom the end and the end is going to come it's a criminal gang that's running the show
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:31.880]  as george callan said the great comedian it's one big club and you ain't in it and by the way i
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:37.400]  know his brother patrick very well he used to actually do trends things for me as well
[3:14:37.400 --> 3:14:43.800]  well it's one big club and you ain't in it again you saw the numbers with a black rock
[3:14:44.520 --> 3:14:54.360]  10 trillion dollars 10 trillion dollars when i was a young guy these things weren't allowed
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:14:58.760]  private equity groups hedge funds did not exist
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:15:09.320]  so what do you do i don't give financial advice but gold silver and bitcoin or the way i see it
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:17.400]  gsb by the way great interview with rich dad roby kusaki go to his channel rich dad put
[3:15:17.400 --> 3:15:23.560]  salenti and show you more of what's going on in the future we're going to be back in a little bit
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:30.920]  it before i go i want to really make this clear 100 you better do all you can to support infowars
[3:15:30.920 --> 3:15:34.840]  and put your money where your heart and mind is because they're going to take this thing down
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:41.080]  and when they go down they're going to take this out with them they'll call us uh anti government
[3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:49.400]  people oh yeah i gotta be for them how dare how dare you question the government that's how low
[3:15:49.400 --> 3:15:54.120]  we've gone we're going to be right back remember support info work
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:03.000]  i want to explain something that is absolutely feed understanding our world it's very very simple
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:09.400]  but the most of all don't know the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:16.040]  creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up
[3:16:16.040 --> 3:16:23.240]  infrastructure intellectual property energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:28.600]  and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[3:16:28.600 --> 3:16:33.320]  manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or
[3:16:33.320 --> 3:16:38.200]  it would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding
[3:16:38.200 --> 3:16:43.560]  every sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies operate
[3:16:43.560 --> 3:16:48.760]  but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization making the companies
[3:16:48.760 --> 3:16:53.640]  they do find the only things left standing this is the great reset this is what's happening now
[3:16:53.640 --> 3:16:59.160]  warn everyone it's the only way to stop it let's go ahead take another call let's talk to malcom
[3:16:59.160 --> 3:17:04.120]  in tennessee welcome hello alex yes malcom all right i will make this quick and real short where
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:09.480]  the other patricks can get on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host
[3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:15.800]  oan shroyer supermail volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable
[3:17:15.800 --> 3:17:21.640]  tank supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have
[3:17:21.640 --> 3:17:28.120]  never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions but also work
[3:17:28.120 --> 3:17:33.240]  quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch

[3:20:45.880 --> 3:20:51.640]  and that's downstairs that's my entire office my other staff in another building over here
[3:20:52.200 --> 3:20:58.120]  but i create my own world because i want to hide from this crazy one that uh it exists and all
[3:20:58.120 --> 3:21:03.800]  the plants that you see i take care of all of them anyway i was talking about before about
[3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:10.040]  yeah there they are yeah there's over about 300 plants in this in this entire office my desk
[3:21:10.040 --> 3:21:20.360]  is behind you can't see it at all but um yeah there it is anyway i was talking about the the rig game
[3:21:20.360 --> 3:21:32.120]  and this is from the financial times on the 15th washington agonizes over allowing the powerful
[3:21:32.120 --> 3:21:40.520]  to trade on wall street agonizing they could give a damn in mid december nancy polosi the democratic
[3:21:40.520 --> 3:21:47.640]  speaker of the house of representatives brushed off calls the legislation to ban trading by members
[3:21:47.640 --> 3:21:56.680]  by members of congress with a throwaway comment we are a free market economy
[3:21:58.760 --> 3:22:01.400]  they should be able to participate in that
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:13.480]  then a most recent open secrets data from 2018 says polosi's net worth
[3:22:14.440 --> 3:22:26.280]  is 114.6 million dollars making her the seventh wealthiest member of congress at the time
[3:22:26.280 --> 3:22:35.800]  all right 114 million dollars
[3:22:38.520 --> 3:22:45.320]  again it's one big club and you ain't in it she's a daddy's girl that's right her daddy
[3:22:45.320 --> 3:22:51.880]  was mayor of baltimore at the height of the height and what do you have you have seven other
[3:22:51.880 --> 3:23:00.120]  lawmakers little lying pieces of garbage lawmakers that are even worth more than her
[3:23:02.040 --> 3:23:09.720]  or in that category in the past two years us lawmakers including richard burr the north carolina
[3:23:09.720 --> 3:23:15.960]  republican repulsive in senator has been accused of improperly trading on confidential information
[3:23:15.960 --> 3:23:23.880]  and it goes on three federal officials who i mentioned chris collins a former republican
[3:23:23.880 --> 3:23:30.200]  member of congress was convicted and sentenced to jail in january 2020 for participating in a scheme
[3:23:30.200 --> 3:23:40.760]  to commit insider trading before being pardoned by donald trump isn't that great commit a crime
[3:23:40.760 --> 3:23:48.280]  and they pardon you but for we the little people here we go in seven miles over the speed limit
[3:23:48.280 --> 3:23:56.280]  get out of your car stand on your head repeat the alphabet backwards you're 0.0 over the limit
[3:23:56.280 --> 3:24:01.080]  over here they handcuff you and throw you in jail but the criminals get pardoned
[3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:07.960]  so that's going on man is which right in front of your eyes
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:11.400]  right in front of your eyes
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:22.600]  according to a poll released this month by convention of states 76 of americans believe
[3:24:23.160 --> 3:24:27.880]  members of congress and their spouses have an unfair edge in financial markets
[3:24:27.880 --> 3:24:32.040]  with just five percent saying they should be allowed to trade
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:41.800]  it's disgusting what's going on i mentioned about the lying little fed freaks
[3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:52.280]  financial times four decade high for us inflation fuels fed fears over job recovery
[3:24:52.280 --> 3:24:59.160]  yep seven percent year on year raise
[3:25:01.640 --> 3:25:06.360]  and consumer prices they knew this was happening all along
[3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:13.480]  so the question is going to be what does it mean what's next and what to do about it
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:21.960]  there's going to be a slowdown here's my forecast they got to bring down inflation
[3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:27.880]  it's not going down on its own and what they talk don't talk about is they say it's all
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:34.600]  because of supply chain disruptions oh once upon a time america didn't have a supply chain
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:41.080]  disruptions when we used to have made in america now the supply chain is from communist china
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:47.480]  and communist vietnam yeah the communists that they taught us to hate and go to war my generation
[3:25:47.480 --> 3:25:55.560]  against the vietnam war and now we import this our number two importer of clothes and shoes
[3:25:56.520 --> 3:26:01.720]  going back to the supply chains that's only part of it the bigger part is all the cheap
[3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:07.320]  money that they've dumped into the system going back to negative and zero interest rate policies
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:14.120]  in the ecb in the united states that's what's driving inflation up what's driving inflation
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:20.520]  up is all that money they pumped in to fight the coven war that the big's got the airlines the big
[3:26:20.520 --> 3:26:26.920]  restaurants yeah and all the money that they got oh and the people didn't work the money that they got
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:36.360]  that's what's driving it up so here's my forecast they're going to do what they did
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:45.640]  when reagan was president and inflation was skyrocketing they ratcheted up interest rates
[3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:56.520]  really high whoa slowed down the economy went into recession back then in 1984 i bought 38 acres
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:02.040]  of land in rinbeck new york with an old house on eight and a half of those acres there were three
[3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:16.200]  parcels for $28,000 that's how down it was and then before the elections they radically lower
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:25.320]  interest rates and boom the stock market took off again only to crash in 87 i forecast they're
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:31.320]  going to do the same thing they're going to tighten tighten interest rates they're going to slow down
[3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:39.800]  the economy things are going to go down they got to bring inflation down you know going to bring
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:49.080]  inflation down and then before the elections in 2024 the presidential elections midterms
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:54.120]  they'll they don't care about the midterms they care about the presidential election
[3:27:54.120 --> 3:28:02.040]  i mean they care about it but not as much as the presidential election they'll slow it down and
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:08.840]  then they'll speed it up so then everybody will be happy as the stock markets keep going up again
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:20.200]  and the phony boom again reignites that's my trend forecast inflation they're going to quiet it down
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:27.080]  and when inflation goes low or so to our gold and silver and bitcoin but they're going to go up
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:32.680]  when the economy goes down because people are going to be looking for safe haven assets
[3:28:32.680 --> 3:28:38.680]  and things are going to get tough very tough we're going through a period that's unprecedented in
[3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:44.280]  human history who would have ever believed with the covid war and who would believe what they're
[3:28:44.280 --> 3:28:53.160]  doing now the worst is yet to come prepare prevail to prosper we're going to be right back with some

[3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:26.840]  are shrunk to nothing so they're filling them up with stupid pitches what do i care about looking

[3:37:54.120 --> 3:38:00.680]  the way the headline reads is somebody's maskless and that person's inaccurate and this is by david
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:10.120]  leonhardt when the supreme court justices emerged from the red drapes at the front of
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:17.080]  the courthouse last friday and took their seats to hear arguments about president biden's vaccine
[3:38:17.080 --> 3:38:27.080]  mandate all but one of the justices were wearing masks the exception was justus neil gorsuch
[3:38:28.680 --> 3:38:38.280]  goes on and on and on and on and on and on justus gorsuch had to know that his masklessness
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:49.880]  could make other justices uncomfortable on and on and on now inaccurate right
[3:38:50.600 --> 3:38:57.400]  down here near the end of the article it gets to the inaccurate part
[3:39:00.360 --> 3:39:07.720]  making the case for mandates justus sotomayor first noted that covid cases were surging and
[3:39:07.720 --> 3:39:16.920]  hospitals were near capacity she then turned her attention to children quote we have over a hundred
[3:39:16.920 --> 3:39:28.120]  thousand children which we never had before in serious condition and many on ventilators and quote
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:39.000]  now we have been saying that this was bs from the beginning now this is much later the times
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:47.240]  writes about it buries it on page 18 in the bottom of the article he goes on to say
[3:39:47.240 --> 3:39:55.240]  the last sentence is simply untrue politifact called it way off
[3:39:59.560 --> 3:40:08.120]  kaya himelman something of the dispatch described it as false and misleading and even cnn made
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:14.360]  a significant false claim the washington post fact checker called it wildly incorrect you're
[3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:22.120]  ready fewer than 5000 us children were in the hospitals with covid in the past week
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:30.200]  not a hundred thousand fewer than 5000 you ready
[3:40:32.840 --> 3:40:42.040]  and many fewer were in serious condition or on ventilators some of the hospitalized children
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:51.320]  probably had incidental cases of the virus meaning they've been hospitalized for other reasons
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:41:00.680]  and tested positive while there covid is overwhelmingly mild in children
[3:41:00.680 --> 3:41:11.960]  and consider these numbers over the past week about 870 children were admitted to hospitals
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:20.600]  with covid according to the cdc by comparison more than 5000 children visit emergency rooms
[3:41:20.600 --> 3:41:29.160]  each week the sports injuries for bronchitis during a typical january week week more than
[3:41:29.160 --> 3:41:32.360]  a hundred that more than a thousand hospitalized for that all right
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:42.520]  there are the facts okay the children are mild why are you getting them vaccinated
[3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:52.360]  first look at the supreme court a supreme jerk spewing out this crap and making decisions
[3:41:52.360 --> 3:41:59.960]  and then they sold out and now healthcare workers and people working in hospitals
[3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:07.080]  have to get the vaccination a moron making these statements and how come that should be
[3:42:07.080 --> 3:42:16.200]  the headline news that should be the front page you got it not supreme court supreme jerk
[3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:25.400]  a supreme jerk spewing out propaganda and you're making a decision that affects me
[3:42:25.400 --> 3:42:29.880]  get this straight everybody all you politicians and all you supreme

[3:43:13.480 --> 3:43:19.240]  tyranny is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their
[3:43:19.240 --> 3:43:24.200]  corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth

[3:48:12.120 --> 3:48:16.600]  at the beginning of at the end of the new year in the beginning of the new year all they talked
[3:48:16.600 --> 3:48:22.600]  about was what happened in 2021 and how about what's going to happen in 2022 well we won't talk about
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:29.080]  that which is stupid so we're just going to go back to 2021 so anyway trendsjournal.com
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:34.200]  and do what you can to support us as well because the more we get the more we do
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:39.640]  Alex is also also talking about the pesticides and all the things that are poisoning us
[3:48:39.640 --> 3:48:48.760]  they keep the numbers year after year we're going into year two or year three it was two years now
[3:48:49.320 --> 3:48:54.040]  in february that they launched actually the covid war was launched just around this time
[3:48:54.680 --> 3:49:04.760]  back in 2020 on lunar chinese lunar new year 2020 so it's two years ago now we're going into the
[3:49:04.760 --> 3:49:16.040]  third year and our magazine cover back then was coronavirus 106 dead in china 1.4 billion still
[3:49:16.040 --> 3:49:22.520]  live what are you telling me this stuff for anyway going back going into our third year so what they
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:28.680]  do is they keep putting the numbers up how many people died of the virus and now over a period
[3:49:28.680 --> 3:49:36.680]  of two years they keep those numbers up so i went to our world in data and i typed in how many people
[3:49:36.680 --> 3:49:45.480]  die from air pollution the authors estimate that in total 8.8 million died prematurely due to air
[3:49:45.480 --> 3:49:57.560]  pollution every year all right why do you think they wear those masks in china that we used to
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:50:05.080]  make fun of because of the air pollution about 1.5 million a year die there but another million
[3:50:05.080 --> 3:50:11.720]  died plus in in india so they're all a crap that they're putting in the air and the pesticides
[3:50:11.720 --> 3:50:22.280]  they're putting in our food in our water all the chemicals nobody talks about that the chemicals
[3:50:22.280 --> 3:50:28.440]  and all what they're doing to our food again there was an article in the in the
[3:50:29.880 --> 3:50:40.520]  wall street journal about how mexico didn't let a couple of thousand boxes of
[3:50:41.320 --> 3:50:47.160]  Kellogg's cereals come in because they were using promotions that they didn't want it because
[3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:52.680]  they're trying to cut back on obesity and overweight in mexico so they said that this
[3:50:52.680 --> 3:50:59.240]  was bad then they would do so they're prohibiting and that kind of advertising so i'm reading the
[3:50:59.240 --> 3:51:06.120]  article and they're talking about how terrible it is in mexico with the weight issue and what
[3:51:06.120 --> 3:51:12.440]  the government is doing to stop these big corporations from pumping junk into the system
[3:51:12.440 --> 3:51:19.160]  and it came out with a number that 73 percent of mexicans are overweight
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:30.360]  they beat america by 1 percent 72 percent of americans are overweight and 40 percent obese
[3:51:31.320 --> 3:51:37.560]  and then when you look at the data again only looking at the data of who's dying from the virus
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:46.040]  according to the cdc 78 percent of the people that would been hospitalized are either obese or
[3:51:46.040 --> 3:51:55.080]  overweight you look at what this country used to be and what it's become and it's a whole different
[3:51:55.080 --> 3:52:03.720]  world you look at the pictures back like when i was a young guy in the wood stock was going on
[3:52:03.720 --> 3:52:09.560]  and by the way michael lang who i knew a wonderful guy who was the guy the top guy that put wood
[3:52:09.560 --> 3:52:15.080]  stock together just passed away he was only 77 you look at the photos of the people there on
[3:52:15.080 --> 3:52:20.200]  wood stock you don't see what they just showed there it's all this junk that people are reading
[3:52:21.480 --> 3:52:27.480]  so again it goes back to the support info was and you're not you're not giving away money
[3:52:27.480 --> 3:52:32.600]  you're doing stuff to help yourself because the better shape you're in the better you're going
[3:52:32.600 --> 3:52:37.960]  to survive mentally spiritually and emotionally if you're in that kind of shape as a young person
[3:52:37.960 --> 3:52:45.880]  you can't live happily ever after no way know how so again you look at the numbers 8.8 million died
[3:52:45.880 --> 3:52:53.400]  prematurely due to air pollution but don't worry about it covid will kill you i'm gonna give you
[3:52:53.400 --> 3:53:05.880]  my forecast this covid war is going to wind down a lot by the end of march mid april they're going
[3:53:05.880 --> 3:53:13.000]  to quiet it down it's destroying lives and livelihoods around the world by the hundreds of
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:21.400]  millions if not billions the protests that are going on now in france in germany they're really
[3:53:21.400 --> 3:53:32.200]  taking off austria netherlands the people aren't going to stop they're going to cut back on this
[3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:41.000]  and i'll tell you where it's going to go to from the covid war to climate change climate change is
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:48.280]  going to be the new new hysteria until the drug companies want to sell more the drug lords want
[3:53:48.280 --> 3:53:55.400]  to sell more their products so they'll start scaring us again mandatory vaccinations for all
[3:53:55.400 --> 3:54:01.880]  by the way that's going back now and by the way if if you don't get a vaccination in austria
[3:54:01.880 --> 3:54:08.040]  you're fined i think it's like four thousand dollars a year and they just came out with a
[3:54:08.040 --> 3:54:15.560]  fine to in greece things like people over 50 or 60 if you're not vaccinated you're fine same thing
[3:54:15.560 --> 3:54:22.520]  in in france they're forcing people over 50 or 60 to get the booster shots now let's go back to the
[3:54:22.520 --> 3:54:37.640]  facts when they sold the vax or the inoculation they said it had a 96 efficacy rate that's a fact
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:44.600]  the israeli health ministry last year brought it down to 39 percent
[3:54:46.920 --> 3:54:51.480]  and now they're telling you to get the boosters so what they're going to do is people will be
[3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:57.640]  used to getting the shots every year i think they're going to ease off on this because it's
[3:54:57.640 --> 3:55:07.640]  killing the global economy china and the united states the trade deficit in the us boom boom boom
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:14.200]  another high all of this bs about the trade deals with china under trump nowhere know how
[3:55:15.160 --> 3:55:19.320]  very important i'm gonna mention this there's an article about
[3:55:19.320 --> 3:55:29.160]  Beijing doubles down on self-sufficiency this is from the 15th of january in the wall street
[3:55:29.160 --> 3:55:39.720]  journal i noted this because what's one of our top trends the 2022 self-sufficiency china's going
[3:55:39.720 --> 3:55:48.520]  into what they call a dual circulation economy they know that yes they'll depend on exports
[3:55:48.520 --> 3:55:57.960]  but they have 1.4 billion people so buy made in china not made anywhere else i mentioned to you
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:07.640]  how the style and the shape of america is going downhill they're not buying the western sounds
[3:56:07.640 --> 3:56:16.600]  and styles and feels and emotions and looks anymore they're buying made in china self-sufficiency
[3:56:16.600 --> 3:56:23.240]  again is one of our top trends that we put out a month ago over a month ago and now you're seeing
[3:56:23.240 --> 3:56:31.720]  it in the headlines it's the only way america could come back is a self-sufficient economy
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:40.520]  and people what should we do to me it's very simple put back in place the trade regulations
[3:56:40.520 --> 3:56:52.040]  and tariffs you had before they did away with them particularly under bill slimy slick willy clinton
[3:56:53.560 --> 3:57:00.040]  before there was a nafta and that's it and made in china and that's all we have here
[3:57:00.840 --> 3:57:06.120]  and once upon a time when i was a kid made in china they used to get the chinese you know
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:15.560]  how dishes oh china made in china not anymore so the future is self-sufficiency again that's
[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:19.400]  what we do with the trends journal it's not about what we like what we want what we wish for it's
[3:57:19.400 --> 3:57:26.360]  what is and china is doing it the 20th century was the american century the 21st century unless
[3:57:26.360 --> 3:57:31.560]  we change it around is going to be the chinese century because the business of america has been
[3:57:31.560 --> 3:57:41.240]  war the business of china is business so do what you can to support info was trendsjournal.com
[3:57:41.240 --> 3:57:43.880]  and check me out on rich dad see you next week
[3:57:48.280 --> 3:57:54.840]  inside you like me fire is burning something needs to change i just want to reach out and
[3:57:54.840 --> 3:58:01.240]  give a recommendation to reset wars it's really powerful reset wars was absolutely amazing and
[3:58:01.240 --> 3:58:07.400]  eye-opening and revolutionary if you want to change your your life for the better i highly
[3:58:07.400 --> 3:58:12.440]  recommend this to alex thank you very much for putting the course together i found it to be
[3:58:12.440 --> 3:58:19.400]  awesome it was worth it to me you have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized
[3:58:19.400 --> 3:58:26.520]  it with scientific this isn't about alex jumps so what you're about to see is a lengthy powerful
[3:58:26.520 --> 3:58:32.280]  well documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding that the power
