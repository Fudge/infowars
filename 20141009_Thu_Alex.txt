[00:00.000 --> 00:13.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.180 --> 00:34.140]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.140 --> 00:39.540]  well the Health and Human Services Secretary has come out and said that
[00:39.540 --> 00:44.820]  there may be other cases in the United States and of course he went on to say
[00:44.820 --> 00:51.220]  and repeat that we need to leave the borders open and have unlimited flights
[00:51.220 --> 00:57.180]  from West Africa into the US to stop it saying that aid workers had to be able
[00:57.180 --> 01:00.620]  to get over there and back when everyone knows there's international aid
[01:00.620 --> 01:07.500]  relief missions from the UN NATO Africa the United States military and that most
[01:07.500 --> 01:11.340]  the aid workers are not flying in and out via aircraft and that's why the
[01:11.340 --> 01:15.660]  French and the British and countless others a month and a half ago banned
[01:15.660 --> 01:20.660]  flights out of the Ebola struck countries and the countries neighboring it
[01:20.660 --> 01:25.580]  neighboring the other nations that have been struck by Ebola the UN estimating
[01:25.580 --> 01:31.140]  millions will have it by December they are controlling their borders and
[01:31.140 --> 01:35.380]  shutting them down and quarantining people but not the United States it is a
[01:35.380 --> 01:45.900]  politically correct religious sacrament because you cannot ever send the message
[01:45.900 --> 01:53.820]  that anyone could ever raise a hand to block a fist the cardinal rule of the
[01:53.820 --> 02:05.700]  collectivist in the parasites is never never ever ever ever allow anyone to
[02:05.700 --> 02:12.380]  defend themselves unless they work for the state or the system the cardinal rule
[02:12.380 --> 02:17.580]  of a criminal system is no one is allowed to defend themselves from crime
[02:17.580 --> 02:27.060]  period or disease or any threat they want pure servile domesticated deaf dumb
[02:27.060 --> 02:33.660]  and blind vassals who can't even communicate or have a costume party
[02:33.660 --> 02:42.060]  because it's racist or scientific words are thought crimes where if you deny
[02:42.060 --> 02:46.700]  that carbon dioxide is causing global warming a proven fact that it's a total
[02:46.700 --> 02:54.460]  fraud then you should be arrested and I agree with Michael Savage I mean
[02:54.460 --> 02:57.500]  obviously they're wanting it to come in they're wanting it to spread on one end
[02:57.500 --> 03:05.420]  to create a crisis is a political diversion from Syria and Turkey basically
[03:05.420 --> 03:10.100]  aiding al Qaeda and attacks on the Kurds and just huge news with what's
[03:10.100 --> 03:15.100]  happening with Russia and Obama acting with executive orders on the future of
[03:15.100 --> 03:19.620]  the internet and on the future of carbon taxes in the future of the military
[03:19.620 --> 03:25.100]  and the future of Obamacare and the future of so many other things all were
[03:25.100 --> 03:30.980]  focused on as a ball of because it is a serious issue but still distraction area
[03:30.980 --> 03:41.260]  overall from the larger globalist offensive that is taking place and the
[03:41.260 --> 03:48.980]  card rule is we can't ever imagine that having privacy protects you or closing
[03:48.980 --> 03:53.220]  your door at night is a good thing or having a border is a good thing only
[03:53.220 --> 03:57.140]  government buildings have fences and guards you don't have a right to own a
[03:57.140 --> 04:01.200]  gun and protect yourself they say it's a privilege just like traveling is not a
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.060]  privilege but they told all their mindless minions that so they they quack it
[04:05.060 --> 04:10.860]  at you at the illegal checkpoints and the rest of it inside the country it is
[04:10.860 --> 04:16.260]  a right and if you're a citizen it's a right to come and go notice the CDC says
[04:16.260 --> 04:19.820]  oh we can't stop anybody from coming and going including people that aren't
[04:19.820 --> 04:26.700]  citizens like the gentleman that just died from Ebola because right now the
[04:26.700 --> 04:31.940]  borders of the US are completely gone the country is wide open we're gonna
[04:31.940 --> 04:35.620]  break it all down today he was on with us a few weeks ago before he goes back to

[04:42.380 --> 04:48.220]  on to take phone calls and also talk about political incorrectness how we
[04:48.220 --> 04:52.620]  counter the Marxist Leninist I mean that's what it is that's not rhetoric

[10:09.540 --> 10:14.220]  come out and say everything's fine the government loves you two plus two equals
[10:14.220 --> 10:17.220]  whatever the government says and raising the debt limit and raise the debt

[10:21.420 --> 10:27.660]  of the team in fact we cue that up because that's basically the cdc said
[10:27.660 --> 10:33.660]  run for the hills were all dead give us more funding oh my god biggest obola
[10:33.660 --> 10:39.660]  outbreak in history which it was taking place in Africa it gestates it
[10:39.660 --> 10:45.140]  incubates for 21 days instead of three meaning can spread a lot longer this is
[10:45.140 --> 10:48.900]  so incredibly dangerous so it could collapse Africa could kill millions and
[10:48.900 --> 10:53.260]  then as soon as it shows up here well first oh it can't show up here it's very
[10:53.260 --> 10:57.020]  unlikely or oh it's no big deal it's here and we don't need to clean anything up
[10:57.020 --> 11:00.100]  and then now they've taken a sheriff's deputy the hospital that they made go
[11:00.100 --> 11:03.900]  into the building why were they sending sheriff's deputies and police into this
[11:03.900 --> 11:08.660]  person's apartment why didn't they have regular hazmat teams there once they
[11:08.660 --> 11:11.940]  knew the guy had a bola they waited three four days why didn't they quarantine
[11:11.940 --> 11:16.100]  the family all the defaults are turned off let me just give the police a little
[11:16.100 --> 11:21.700]  newsflash here i'm sure you already know this the default is you don't go in to a
[11:21.700 --> 11:26.740]  house with smallpox or Ebola a you're just gonna catch it and spread it be it's
[11:26.740 --> 11:32.300]  not your job it's the health department's job and the state health
[11:32.300 --> 11:36.740]  department's job and the CDC does have the prerogative over it on the borders
[11:36.740 --> 11:43.660]  and it's hogged all the public funding and so it is their job de facto but as
[11:43.660 --> 11:47.180]  usual they wouldn't help in Katrina FEMA blocked everybody for at least eight
[11:47.180 --> 11:52.900]  days blocked all the local counties and cities and the Texas fire departments
[11:52.900 --> 11:55.740]  and police departments that came they could have turned the power back on and
[11:55.740 --> 12:01.140]  fixed everything but no no you can't send the message that the states or the
[12:01.140 --> 12:04.500]  counties or other states working together could fix things so they had to
[12:04.500 --> 12:08.820]  cut the police communication lines remember that it came out on CBS News
[12:08.820 --> 12:16.700]  we actually had the was the name Rashard the New Orleans parish
[12:16.700 --> 12:25.780]  sheriff on we had him on they were ordered to stand down and he sat there for four
[12:25.780 --> 12:31.180]  days while his mother was in several feet of water up to the gurney she was on
[12:31.180 --> 12:36.620]  in a nursing home in New Orleans and he followed orders and didn't go and get his
[12:36.620 --> 12:40.940]  mama and his mama died let me just give her by a little newsflash here if the
[12:40.940 --> 12:44.860]  feds are blockading a city just because of water and won't let people and won't
[12:44.860 --> 12:49.500]  let local departments get old people out of a nursing home or a hospital and my
[12:49.500 --> 12:53.260]  mother's in there or my family's in there I'm coming to get them and that's
[12:53.260 --> 12:58.900]  not shooting my mouth off I've got my life force I've got my common sense I
[12:58.900 --> 13:03.700]  remember watching that sheriff get up on TV and break down crying about how they
[13:03.700 --> 13:09.340]  wouldn't let him go get his mama 30 years ago the sheriffs would laugh at
[13:09.340 --> 13:13.820]  the FBI and FEMA telling them they didn't have jurisdiction in their own
[13:13.820 --> 13:18.180]  county because everybody and the reason I raise this now is just the same thing
[13:18.180 --> 13:26.980]  with Ebola and political correctness and all the rest of it they won't control
[13:26.980 --> 13:32.060]  our borders and they won't stop the flights even though everybody else is
[13:32.060 --> 13:36.260]  from West Africa and countries that have literally collapsed the country's
[13:36.260 --> 13:42.220]  right next door to Liberia and Sierra Leone and all the other four or five
[13:42.220 --> 13:46.620]  countries that have it they have machine gun nests shut up third world
[13:46.620 --> 13:51.860]  African dictators have more common sense to quote Michael Savage here
[13:51.860 --> 13:58.620]  yesterday than our government but see it's not common sense our government
[13:58.620 --> 14:03.540]  knows what it's doing it is a religion to have open borders under globalism and
[14:03.540 --> 14:08.380]  you could only have super region responses super border responses from
[14:08.380 --> 14:13.700]  northern Guatemala up to Alaska in all the New World Order North American Union
[14:13.700 --> 14:18.820]  EU Asian Pacific trade partnership documents you can't have nations or
[14:18.820 --> 14:23.820]  cities or states or counties that are allowed to respond you only can have
[14:23.820 --> 14:27.980]  global government respond and so when they order the stand-downs all over the
[14:27.980 --> 14:32.180]  world this is done then people say something must be done give more
[14:32.180 --> 14:38.740]  funding to the multinational multi-regional NATO save us you in save
[14:38.740 --> 14:47.340]  us here comes the big central planners they know what to do so what we're
[14:47.340 --> 14:57.700]  doing is decoding what's in plain view answered 1984 is 1776 I guess that's
[14:57.700 --> 15:04.140]  kind of terrorism to actually come out and say that the answer to 1984 1776 or
[15:04.140 --> 15:06.940]  maybe folks out there the new listeners from the mainstream media are so dumb
[15:06.940 --> 15:11.060]  down you don't know what that means we get emails every day and we and I get
[15:11.060 --> 15:15.620]  asked on the street what's that mean gee the answer to 1984 an oppressive
[15:15.620 --> 15:21.700]  dystopian anti-individual anti-classical liberal anti-constitution anti-
[15:21.700 --> 15:29.940]  America anti-renaissance anti-freedom is 1776 individuals from the poorest of
[15:29.940 --> 15:33.740]  the most wealthy putting everything they have on the line up against the
[15:33.740 --> 15:42.980]  military no one had ever defeated and that no one defeated sense the English
[15:42.980 --> 15:50.260]  military and Navy beat the French the Dutch the Spanish the Portuguese the
[15:50.260 --> 15:57.380]  Austrians the Hungarian Empire the Russians everyone until they went up
[15:57.380 --> 16:02.060]  against 1776 because people weren't gonna stop fighting and weren't gonna stop
[16:02.060 --> 16:07.140]  killing and weren't gonna stop writing and exposing that they had the moral
[16:07.140 --> 16:13.460]  high ground that's what it comes down to they beat Napoleon just a few years
[16:13.460 --> 16:19.700]  later couldn't beat us that's what 1776 means that's what they demonize it and
[16:19.700 --> 16:24.060]  oh they were they were bad they did this and that in their time they were the
[16:24.060 --> 16:28.540]  Renaissance men in their time they were calling for more freedom the ideals
[16:28.540 --> 16:34.460]  that they promoted we have not even yet realized but just a small realization of
[16:34.460 --> 16:47.860]  it created wealth and power untold that's why 1776 is the answer to 1984 it was
[16:47.860 --> 16:55.580]  actually a famous British mathematician and statistics man who came to me in
[16:55.580 --> 16:58.420]  Canada wanted to meet me died a few years after I forget his name we can
[16:58.420 --> 17:01.220]  look it up we had dinner with a few times looked him up turn he was a really
[17:01.220 --> 17:06.980]  famous government statistician and mathematician and he said you knew Alex
[17:06.980 --> 17:14.500]  the n-fect in 1984 is 1776 and that is absolutely right ladies and gentlemen I
[17:14.500 --> 17:20.260]  didn't coin that I popularized it and that's what it comes down to the answer
[17:20.260 --> 17:26.940]  to 1984 is 1776 does that mean the national government's perfect no does
[17:26.940 --> 17:29.380]  it mean the state government's perfect no this mean the county government's
[17:29.380 --> 17:32.340]  perfect no does it mean the city government's perfect no does it mean
[17:32.340 --> 17:41.060]  your local housing authorities perfect no it's all being centralized now under
[17:41.060 --> 17:47.900]  UNESCO under the UN under a Jenna 21 treaty to remove any local control and
[17:47.900 --> 17:53.540]  that's why they the feds will stand down let everything get worse and then
[17:53.540 --> 17:57.860]  demand more power and trillions more funding over the next decade the same
[17:57.860 --> 18:02.060]  response in Australia the same response in Europe the same response all over
[18:02.060 --> 18:06.340]  bring in the people that have Ebola let them spread it in the hospitals now
[18:06.340 --> 18:15.460]  happening in Australia in Spain same global program in England if you are
[18:15.460 --> 18:19.940]  robbed three times and finally fight back with a golf club and break somebody's
[18:19.940 --> 18:23.260]  collarbone they put you in jail for eight years the guy that's trying to rape
[18:23.260 --> 18:28.060]  your wife gets no jail time soothes you and wins because the ultimate crime now
[18:28.060 --> 18:32.060]  is standing up for yourself bullies beating your kid up never gets in
[18:32.060 --> 18:37.180]  trouble your child fights back the police will take them to jail because the
[18:37.180 --> 18:42.980]  ultimate sin it's not the police doing it it's the bureaucrats at the school the
[18:42.980 --> 18:49.620]  political correctness the ultimate sin is defending yourself you're only allowed
[18:49.620 --> 18:54.260]  to go to the state and go to the system for it to then come swoop in and then
[18:54.260 --> 18:58.820]  when you call it in it will generally come in and do your bidding but only for
[18:58.820 --> 19:07.180]  a season only until it's taken over and set the precedent that only it has the
[19:07.180 --> 19:13.180]  right to force what do the UN say in their unidire document July 7th 2000

[24:04.340 --> 24:08.060]  the GCN radio network
[24:14.780 --> 24:21.500]  there's a national poll out today 40% of Americans believe the government the
[24:21.500 --> 24:26.260]  federal government which doesn't exist it's totally seized by foreign banking
[24:26.260 --> 24:31.740]  interest publicly completely predatory seizes as human resources they believe
[24:31.740 --> 24:35.860]  the federal government will save them from Ebola well if you call forced
[24:35.860 --> 24:44.220]  inoculations and mass illnesses and death saving you then I I guess so if you
[24:44.220 --> 24:47.780]  go back to the actual numbers we've had medical doctors on to break this down and
[24:47.780 --> 24:53.420]  shown the graphs of polio in this country in the 1950s it got worse after they
[24:53.420 --> 24:57.500]  started the inoculations and they just called it paralysis my grandmother got
[24:57.500 --> 25:05.940]  polio one month after receiving the polio vaccine but everything is awesome
[25:05.940 --> 25:10.180]  we're told and there's no side effects from vaccines and it's the law you've
[25:10.180 --> 25:14.260]  got to take them to go to school and Garda sills the law and people with a
[25:14.260 --> 25:18.500]  straight face go Alex I don't believe you they say it's the law to take Gardasil
[25:18.500 --> 25:21.820]  they say it's the law to take vaccines to go to school and I go there is no law
[25:21.820 --> 25:29.820]  on either front they're lying to you and then I say Google vaccine waiver form
[25:29.820 --> 25:36.980]  and it's a waiver to something that's not even a law it's to policy and then
[25:36.980 --> 25:41.340]  there is no law for Gardasil it's not even recommended anymore but doesn't
[25:41.340 --> 25:45.180]  matter see because they have someone in a health department white lab coat get up
[25:45.180 --> 25:49.020]  on local TV because we trust the locals more they're really reading a global
[25:49.020 --> 25:53.460]  script that's all centralized and they don't even think about that they just
[25:53.460 --> 25:57.820]  go do their job I ran into one of the heads of the state health department on
[25:57.820 --> 26:02.220]  the hiking bike trail over the vaccine program he told me his name he said just
[26:02.220 --> 26:05.980]  don't use it and I looked it up and he admitted yeah vaccines are hurting a lot
[26:05.980 --> 26:08.820]  of people but it's just got to be done you know for the overall good and I said
[26:08.820 --> 26:12.980]  but a lot of the numbers and studies show it's actually worse overall and he
[26:12.980 --> 26:19.940]  said well that really matter does it so see I didn't mean to digress off it's
[26:19.940 --> 26:23.540]  just that here's here's the Ebola stack of news and I'll get into all the North
[26:23.540 --> 26:28.860]  Korea news the latest on the Middle East news and the economy news and more HHS
[26:28.860 --> 26:34.260]  secretary there may be other cases of Ebola in the United States well I thought
[26:34.260 --> 26:38.420]  it was preposterous that this guy running around for a couple weeks you know
[26:38.420 --> 26:42.060]  with Ebola might spread it I mean that's just who would think that probably
[26:42.060 --> 26:49.100]  a conspiracy theorist Ebola crisis global response has failed miserably says
[26:49.100 --> 26:54.700]  World Bank chief Jim Kim demands 20 billion fund of course to the private
[26:54.700 --> 26:58.740]  banking consolidation to give to their buddies and says we failed miserably oh
[26:58.740 --> 27:03.540]  see they screwed up and the answer is 20 billion to the IMF and World Bank who
[27:03.540 --> 27:07.820]  are the governmental global fronts they're the worldwide equivalent of the
[27:07.820 --> 27:13.100]  private Federal Reserve that calls itself federal and member 20 years ago
[27:13.100 --> 27:16.860]  people most people thought it the Federal Reserve was really federal almost
[27:16.860 --> 27:22.540]  everyone now knows it's not federal it's a fraud con game just sad issue see
[27:22.540 --> 27:29.260]  this is planet hoax folks it's all lies Jim Kim demands 20 billion fund and says
[27:29.260 --> 27:37.180]  we failed miserably as cases in Spain and US fuel fear of Western pandemic gee
[27:37.180 --> 27:41.380]  I I said they'd want IMF and World Bank money three months ago when all this
[27:41.380 --> 27:44.740]  started cranking up and I said they'd let it get out of control if they followed
[27:44.740 --> 27:52.300]  their past MO and criminals follow a modus operandi and now it's happening
[27:52.300 --> 27:57.020]  just as we said it would the president of the World Bank Jim Kim admitted oh he
[27:57.020 --> 28:00.540]  admitted on Wednesday that the international community had failed
[28:00.540 --> 28:03.740]  miserably in his response to Ebola virus that had killed more than 3,000
[28:03.740 --> 28:07.380]  hundred people in West Africa and one of the crisis now affecting Spain and the
[28:07.380 --> 28:11.700]  US was going to get much worse why did you bring people with Ebola into Spain
[28:11.700 --> 28:15.860]  and then health care workers are getting it gee that's what we said what
[28:15.860 --> 28:22.020]  happened not because we're that smart 2 plus 2 equals 4 yeah I'm sorry I'm the
[28:22.020 --> 28:26.460]  bad man hundreds of publications demonize this because we dare say this
[28:26.460 --> 28:31.220]  was coming and they demonize drudge as well because he dared say it oh my gosh
[28:31.220 --> 28:36.540]  we're so horrible we link to the CDC's own reports and the UN's own reports we

[45:32.980 --> 45:36.940]  it and then tweet it out to people get it out to folks you're the real power of
[45:36.940 --> 45:42.540]  this transmission remember five years ago when somebody in LA put out the
[45:42.540 --> 45:46.980]  Obama Joker image and they called for their arrest in the LA newspapers and
[45:46.980 --> 45:50.980]  TV saying you know he's our god you don't do that it's racist and I said
[45:50.980 --> 45:56.500]  that's not American that's mind control we're gonna do it and so we called for a
[45:56.500 --> 46:00.660]  $5,000 contest of whoever could put up you know the most in their town
[46:00.660 --> 46:05.220]  videotape it and put a YouTube out in legal and lawful areas and from Florida
[46:05.220 --> 46:10.340]  to Wisconsin from New York to Texas they called for the arrest on TV that
[46:10.340 --> 46:14.700]  someone had put down the god Obama so folks responded by putting even more out
[46:14.700 --> 46:18.300]  and they backed off and said okay it's free speech we're not gonna arrest you
[46:18.300 --> 46:21.260]  did it see you got a call the political correct
[46:21.260 --> 46:25.220]  authoritarian's they're trying to shut you up with their bully you know how to
[46:25.220 --> 46:31.660]  meet a bully and we're gonna do another contest I think exposing the fact that
[46:31.660 --> 46:35.740]  the government's behind Ebola open the borders up I think we're gonna do an
[46:35.740 --> 46:41.780]  Ebola or Obama connected to to Ebola contest be a quick turnaround $10,000
[46:41.780 --> 46:45.180]  deal I'm gonna I'm gonna write it up today launch it tomorrow and you'll have
[46:45.180 --> 46:49.940]  like 10 15 days to turn it around and then put your YouTube video up and then
[46:49.940 --> 46:52.420]  we'll give it a week to judge it but I think we need to really hit them hard

[46:57.060 --> 47:01.380]  contest to really show the power of the people a V for vendetta putting the V's

[47:05.580 --> 47:10.180]  that have that have shown the power of you you have the power you are the
[47:10.180 --> 47:16.500]  resistance you are the ones taking action you are the ones that when you

[47:26.260 --> 47:29.860]  down no but the act of resistance spreading and realizing we have the
[47:29.860 --> 47:36.540]  power will. Here's John Bounds report ISIS is here because we've got the
[47:36.540 --> 47:40.300]  White House coming out today saying there's no Al Qaeda there's no ISIS but
[47:40.300 --> 47:43.140]  we got to take all your rights because Al Qaeda such an imminent threat meanwhile
[47:43.140 --> 47:47.700]  Turkey's been caught openly aiding Al Qaeda known as IS or ISIS or Coruscant
[47:47.700 --> 47:51.100]  or whatever the name is to confuse us attacking the Kurds and the Kurds are
[47:51.100 --> 47:55.380]  responding by now starting to burn stuff down inside Turkey the ethnic Kurds so
[47:55.380 --> 48:02.140]  let's go ahead and go to this report ladies and gentlemen the John Bounds
[48:02.140 --> 48:07.740]  filed on ISIS is here in America Homeland Security saying that they believe
[48:07.740 --> 48:11.580]  there is an imminent threat being planned and then an attack will take place
[48:11.580 --> 48:17.260]  they said that last Friday and again on Sunday in and around El Paso the Fort
[48:17.260 --> 48:21.980]  Bliss Joint Task Force 6 area I want to be clear I'm the guy that exposes
[48:21.980 --> 48:27.140]  false flag I'm the guy that officially began questioning 9-11 on the day of the
[48:27.140 --> 48:32.300]  event I see comments on Info War saying you know Alex why are you saying that
[48:32.300 --> 48:35.780]  there could be a real ISIS threat why are you it's gonna be a host gonna be a
[48:35.780 --> 48:42.500]  false flag it is a false flag because ISIS has been empowered and funded by
[48:42.500 --> 48:46.820]  NATO and Homeland Security and they'll use an attack to take our liberties it
[48:46.820 --> 48:56.820]  does not mean there aren't jihadi not balls that are coming to attack us see
[48:56.820 --> 49:00.620]  the media always spends it that a false flag means it's totally staged by the
[49:00.620 --> 49:05.980]  government no elements of the government can fund terrorist and then let them
[49:05.980 --> 49:10.380]  attack as Rand Paul ever been to Syria has he ever met with ISIS is the other
[49:10.380 --> 49:13.700]  man's cause of any of these people no no no I don't we're gonna have a fight
[49:13.700 --> 49:18.300]  because it's patently false this is the same Rand Paul that said we didn't want
[49:18.300 --> 49:21.980]  to have anything to do with with anything to do in the Middle East by the
[49:21.980 --> 49:25.900]  way I don't want to get in a fight with him at all you know but it's not true I
[49:25.900 --> 49:31.180]  know these people I'm in contact with them all the time let me ask you that
[49:31.180 --> 49:36.140]  he is not a center is not I mean let's remember here the people we are fighting
[49:36.140 --> 49:42.260]  today we funded 20 years ago and we did it because we were locked in this
[49:42.260 --> 49:48.060]  struggle with the Soviet Union they invaded Afghanistan and we did not want
[49:48.060 --> 49:55.260]  to see them control Central Asia and we went to work and it was President Reagan
[49:55.260 --> 50:00.980]  in partnership with the Congress led by Democrats who said you know what sounds
[50:00.980 --> 50:05.580]  like a pretty good idea let's deal with the ISI and the Pakistani military and
[50:05.580 --> 50:09.500]  let's go recruit these Mujahideen and let's great let's get some to come from
[50:09.500 --> 50:14.820]  Saudi Arabia and other places importing their Wahhabi brand of Islam so that we
[50:14.820 --> 50:19.100]  can go beat the Soviet Union that's what most false flags are is opening the
[50:19.100 --> 50:22.980]  door letting it happen look at how the British government was in the news two
[50:22.980 --> 50:27.740]  days ago he's going to quote retrain the Jihadis coming back from Syria because
[50:27.740 --> 50:31.060]  huge amounts of them tens of thousands have come out of England they're allowed
[50:31.060 --> 50:36.420]  to fly in and out they're allowed to have Twitter and Facebook accounts they
[50:36.420 --> 50:42.100]  are being protected they're being protected here it's in the news today in
[50:42.100 --> 50:46.860]  my stack that'll that radical Islamist terrorists are using the open borders and
[50:46.860 --> 50:54.420]  the open visa program prior to last night they were it was running about 73
[50:54.420 --> 51:00.300]  percent of the people apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley or OTM's other than
[51:00.300 --> 51:06.940]  Mexican a lot of Central Americans but really from all over the the world and
[51:06.940 --> 51:13.980]  we were informed last night that that number has escalated to 80 percent so
[51:13.980 --> 51:19.540]  and this is this is a fact so most of the people that we encounter here larger
[51:19.540 --> 51:23.060]  percentage of them are people from other other countries other than Mexico and
[51:23.060 --> 51:28.940]  we're not told about the special interest aliens we have had Somalians here
[51:28.940 --> 51:36.180]  once they got on that special alien list they won't tell us that anymore but
[51:36.180 --> 51:43.740]  there have been some Somalians India Sri Lanka Nepal Chinese you name it we've
[51:43.740 --> 51:49.700]  had it here we've also found evidence that people from these special interest
[51:49.700 --> 51:55.500]  countries in particular Pakistan and Afghanistan Iran are coming through our
[51:55.500 --> 52:00.900]  property during one of our Texas border volunteer operations last year we had a
[52:00.900 --> 52:06.780]  group of 10 we spotted we followed them informed the border patrol where they
[52:06.780 --> 52:10.540]  were going to come out on the highway border patrol were not able to respond
[52:10.540 --> 52:17.380]  fast enough they got they climbed the fence and loaded up and left and were
[52:17.380 --> 52:22.780]  not caught but as one of them was climbing over the fence he dropped a
[52:22.780 --> 52:31.060]  package and that package was an Urdu dictionary Urdu is a language spoken in
[52:31.060 --> 52:38.900]  Pakistan and Afghanistan and in that translation book Urdu in English there
[52:38.900 --> 52:44.620]  were a lot of phrases circled and outlined do you speak Spanish do you
[52:44.620 --> 52:49.100]  speak English so it's easier for them to slip through this private property and
[52:49.100 --> 52:54.940]  that's just one example and more recently within the past two weeks some
[52:54.940 --> 52:59.580]  Iranian money was found in a bailout vehicle so we know they're coming in
[52:59.580 --> 53:04.980]  here besides that Iranian money being found in a bailout vehicle up here for
[53:04.980 --> 53:11.220]  Syrians which is not you know public news yet but for Syrians were apprehended
[53:11.220 --> 53:17.220]  on the Rio Grande River a couple days ago okay to put an online magazine that
[53:17.220 --> 53:21.620]  states they want to hit the Air Force Academy they want to hit a Military
[53:21.620 --> 53:26.500]  Academy in Georgia they want to hit Las Vegas and once again New York is
[53:26.500 --> 53:30.540]  another target as well Times Squares so these are very trying and they now have
[53:30.540 --> 53:35.220]  12 passenger jets in working order and have been photographed celebrating with
[53:35.220 --> 54:04.180]  them basically saying they're gonna kill us with them we found backpacks with
[54:04.180 --> 54:10.460]  Koran's another fellow found a backpack with a prayer rug in it you find
[54:10.460 --> 54:14.860]  hypodermic needles you find pregnancy tests you find everything in the world
[54:14.860 --> 54:19.940]  in this trash another friend had 10 Chinese in his yard there's Arabs
[54:19.940 --> 54:26.540]  coming the border patrol said at 1.3 out of 10 that they apprehended was
[54:26.540 --> 54:32.500]  OTMs other than Mexicans there's there's all kinds of people this is a
[54:32.500 --> 54:36.940]  national security issue everything that you're getting on the media is a lie
[54:36.940 --> 54:44.180]  we live this every day 24 hours and it is not secure when we got the wall built
[54:44.180 --> 54:50.900]  on our ranch it is known as a force multiplier and immediately they deployed
[54:50.900 --> 54:55.460]  agents that used to patrol the border before the 10 12 14 foot wall you have
[54:55.460 --> 55:00.180]  18 foot wall on this site they took agents off the border because it's a
[55:00.180 --> 55:06.540]  force multiplier ISIS cells that were active in the more is area which is
[55:06.540 --> 55:10.580]  northern part of Chihuahua state and that they were moving around over there
[55:10.580 --> 55:17.660]  that they had just that there was some activity and for the sheriff's along the
[55:17.660 --> 55:21.700]  border to be on the alert for all law enforcement to be on the alert and to be
[55:21.700 --> 55:25.180]  on the lookout for these people may be trying to come across if they show their
[55:25.180 --> 55:29.700]  ugly head in our area we'll send them to hell and I think the United States need
[55:29.700 --> 55:36.020]  to get busy and they need to bomb them they need to take them out I would like
[55:36.020 --> 55:40.620]  for them to hit them so hard and so often that every time they hear a
[55:40.620 --> 55:44.460]  propeller on a plane or a jet aircraft engine that they urinate down both legs
[55:44.460 --> 55:49.780]  now the reason they picked war is could be a strategic move this is just right
[55:49.780 --> 55:54.980]  across the border war is no more than a few miles to my left now we also have
[55:54.980 --> 55:57.660]  you know many other buildings in this area that we've talked about we have the
[55:57.660 --> 56:03.300]  military base FBI has an office you have any information or any evidence that
[56:03.300 --> 56:10.660]  they're actually coming in the southern border now yes yes I know that at
[56:10.660 --> 56:13.700]  least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in
[56:13.700 --> 56:18.620]  Texas there's there's nobody there's there's there's because I've asked
[56:18.620 --> 56:22.460]  because I've asked the border patrol Greta and the border patrol they just let
[56:22.460 --> 56:27.620]  ISIS ISIS members as we come across the border no they caught them at the
[56:27.620 --> 56:30.980]  border therefore we know the ISIS is coming across the border to central
[56:30.980 --> 56:34.700]  Texas man arrested on terror related charges will both have a detention
[56:34.700 --> 56:38.420]  hearing tomorrow afternoon in federal court Rahatul Khan and Michael Wolf
[56:38.420 --> 56:42.740]  both 23 were arrested separately this week they're both accused of providing
[56:42.740 --> 56:47.020]  support to terrorists is their synergy is their interaction is there a
[56:47.020 --> 56:56.460]  connection between the Mexican cartels and groups like ISIS my opinion is yes
[56:56.460 --> 57:03.780]  there seems to be a at least I'm talking up to each other how much I don't know
[57:03.780 --> 57:11.460]  but they're using drug cartels use the same operational plan as terrorist
[57:11.460 --> 57:17.140]  groups do people from terrorist countries countries that are deemed
[57:17.140 --> 57:22.340]  special interest countries pouring in here undetected it's time to step up
[57:22.340 --> 57:27.020]  and shut the border down we can shut the border down in Afghanistan or Iraq
[57:27.020 --> 57:30.900]  that's a big priority our biggest priority needs to be shut down this
[57:30.900 --> 57:36.700]  south of the southwestern border anyway you slice it they're leaving the
[57:36.700 --> 57:40.900]  borders wide open they are funding ISIS worldwide they are letting them come
[57:40.900 --> 57:46.020]  into the United States so that when they attack Obama composes a savior and
[57:46.020 --> 57:51.020]  take more liberties when they've opened us up remember homeland security is now
[57:51.020 --> 57:56.620]  pointed at gun owners returning veterans libertarians conservatives it's very
[57:56.620 --> 58:00.060]  simple what's happening just like they're letting the Ebola come in just like
[58:00.060 --> 58:05.740]  they're bringing the Ebola come in into the country this is their plan and we
[58:05.740 --> 58:11.500]  have to ask ourselves why are they doing it the only way we can help stop this
[58:11.500 --> 58:15.860]  from happening is by pointing out that when it does happen the central
[58:15.860 --> 58:20.420]  government and the Democratic Party specifically are to blame and they
[58:20.420 --> 58:24.420]  might actually do something about it but remember you're losing your freedoms
[58:24.420 --> 58:28.900]  because of al-Qaeda threats or ISIS threats while our government openly
[58:28.900 --> 58:33.180]  funds it that's not our government it's an illegitimate criminal group that's
[58:33.180 --> 58:36.780]  why nothing makes sense when you realize they want to bring the country down then
[58:36.780 --> 58:40.540]  it all makes total sense stay with us second hour

[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:46.140]  anarchic capitalism one of the icons of the movement he was on a few weeks ago
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.620]  but he's about to leave the US again so I wanted to get him back on today enjoy
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:55.460]  speaking in his conference three weeks ago and I want to bring up Kim Jong-un's
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:01.060]  absence to him what an illustration of just pathetic government on parade and
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:05.660]  what big government always basically ends up as is a bunch of crazy people in a
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:11.820]  big building sitting around like peacocks regaling themselves with titles
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:17.460]  of nobility and then that's what North Korea is is a royal system even mainline
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:22.180]  analysts now say that I've been saying for 15 years and it's just it's just a
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:27.900]  total cult of scumbaggery Kim Jong-un's not in charge as he got voted in he's
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:31.900]  not in charge because he created beautiful music or was beautiful or was
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:36.580]  smart or was cool now he was there because his dad was a communist puppet
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:41.460]  of the Chinese Communist and put his son in charge and he put his son in
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:52.500]  charge and notice how the dynasties degenerate quicker and quicker now one
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.660]  should not try to eat lunch during a one-minute break is the last hour ended
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:03.900]  it's just there's so many things that I call Rosetta stones that are issues that
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:09.100]  through them you can just see how the whole world works big government
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:17.620]  centralization creates Kim Jong-un Nazi Germany Maoist China I mean look how
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:26.140]  pathetic he is of your TV viewer imagine the patheticness of a giant rotting
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.660]  country that building he's standing in front of they've been building for 20
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:34.820]  plus years they can never open it they can't even get their cars to run
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:38.460]  properly they can't manufacture anything they have giant slave camps
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:48.380]  everywhere and this is the model the globalist would like us to live under
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:54.700]  they can't even keep their uniforms in good shape to then stand around and
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:03:02.780]  write things while he gives orders the cult of a giant fat little sack of
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:09.820]  maggots with a bunch of gibbering cult slaves standing around and then I look
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:15.020]  at Democrats and so-called liberals and they literally are a Kim Jong-un cult of
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:19.260]  political correctness and trendiness they have nothing they have no future they
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.220]  have all these college degrees that are worthless outside the system that's
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:26.860]  collapsing but they don't care they have victory they have their adoration of
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:35.700]  BB of big brother they have their adoration of Kim Jong-un a parallel
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:41.180]  Obama to Kim Jong-un you got a business you didn't build that let's go back
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:47.020]  let's look at Kim Jong-un with all the girls and when his dad died three days
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:56.180]  of can we queue up the fake crying North Koreans cry Kim Jong-un and
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:01.740]  look at the young 16-year-old girl in the uniform all just trying to compete
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:07.340]  who can grab on him that's what Hollywood is they click on the Pimpin ain't
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:11.540]  easy one that's what Hollywood is what whatever Bernays talked about and
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:15.740]  advertising in the 20s how they would put it out there and then show the person
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.300]  they would have fake only the first ones had to be fake in the 20s and 30s
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.980]  they would have all these people from the back lot of the production studio
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:28.860]  show up dressed up fawning and yelling at the male stars and female stars and
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.220]  then they would put it on the newsreels and advertise that next week another
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.900]  showing was happening and people would show up and copy it and then the pump
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.700]  was primed so in North Korea he shows up with a stupid haircut there's a little
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:45.580]  outfit and all these starving girls run up and they go I got a touching that's
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:49.980]  what fads are that's what trendiness is that's how incredibly empty you

[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:09.580]  claims of racism now last year they'd had one and someone came as an Eskimo
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.940]  and that made everybody some people upset so they said this year it'll be a
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:18.420]  Bollywood or dress up in indian costumes it's nothing to do with the fact
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:21.780]  that yoga comes from India and it was like you're saying hey let's have fun
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:26.100]  like if you're in a fraternity you dress up in togas that's that's racism of
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:32.140]  course against Greeks or if you go to a October fest you hate Germans you see and
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:36.620]  so there were threats and people showed up and then South Asian community got
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.780]  involved and they said that's not allowed they said yes you're right we're
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:43.900]  just not going to have a costume party for Halloween period at one of the
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.340]  largest yoga studios in Austin Texas and then I learned it's going on
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:53.420]  everywhere in Austin a crown jewel of cult brainwashing literal cult brainwashing
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:59.460]  the totalitarianism branded as liberal that they are openly all over the
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.780]  nation you've seen this last few years colleges everywhere saying don't use the
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:07.380]  name man or woman boy or girl can't have separate bathrooms can't have separate
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:11.700]  locker rooms can't come as a cowboy an Indian a geisha girl they have guidelines
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:17.060]  we have it linked in our article major universities you can come as a zombie or
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:21.620]  space alien that's the examples of what's okay do not come as a pirate do
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:27.620]  not come as a Russian do not come as a Native American do not because it's
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:32.180]  her see if you but but you know it's like if a kid draws a picture of a gun in
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:36.020]  school they get they get arrested but you can give a kid a video game where
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:41.660]  they do thousands of simulated murders per game per time they play per session
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:46.420]  there's no laws either there's no law you can't shoot a nerf gun in your
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.500]  backyard and the neighbor sees it and calls the schools who you're suspended
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.420]  the school has no jurisdiction they couldn't kick you out in school for a
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:59.500]  nerf gun but they claim it's their policy no one challenges it all over the
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.820]  country ladies and gentlemen they're banning fiesta parties you want to
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:08.100]  have a fraternity party that tries to get new pledges with a theme of Mexican
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:12.580]  food because I mean I've had many parties where we have Mexican food because
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:17.380]  it's good I'm gonna be honest I've had parties in college and after where we
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:22.580]  go get little sombreros and stuff and we because it's fun folks and you know what
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:25.660]  I've been to my Mexican friends houses where it's you know everybody's there
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:28.980]  and they like to have them too because you know it's fun and it's fun to have
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.860]  Western style parties you know private school my kids go to the last one
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:38.340]  before this one they had a one time a year a Western barbecue party where
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.940]  they barbecue and you wear cowboy hats and boots because you know why because
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:46.700]  it's to put down Texans or it's to put down Mexican cowboys no people like to
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:52.100]  dress up in different outfits I went to Oktoberfest Saturday night Fredericksburg
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:57.380]  Texas and I had a good time and you know what there were black people in
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.020]  Hispanics there wearing little German hats and they were having fun dancing
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:05.540]  around the polka music that sounds like Tejana music everybody was just having
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:09.260]  a good time they don't want you to have any culture but the big plastic fake
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:14.220]  Hollywood culture and they use anthropology the CIA on record to
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.340]  balkanize and play countries off against each other they use they build up our
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:21.460]  differences then they hype them then they play us off against each other it is
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:27.900]  psychological warfare and is sick now once they've demonized all cultures and
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.580]  sold as a plastic culture we can be like North Korea where everything else is
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:36.620]  awesome or you get put in a forced labor camp or killed Kim Jong-un's absence
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:42.380]  fuels rumors over the weekend of course North Korean military leaders show up
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:46.300]  he hasn't been seen in over a month he's been engaging in mass executions of the
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:51.580]  ruling class a little stunted demonic creature who grew up in Switzerland in
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:55.820]  a palace who thinks that Dennis Rodman is cool totally disconnected with top
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.700]  generals like oh we love you Dennis Rodman I mean beyond Twilight Zone
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:03.580]  truth is stranger than fiction he's not been missing we've been covering it for
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:07.500]  a month but now it's a big deal and there's all this talk and remember when
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:12.140]  his dad died a few years ago the days of crying and begging this is the mass
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:16.540]  cult of political correctness this is what it is group think I reject it let's
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.780]  play some of that video and audio of the abject worship when Kim Jong-un spent on
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:26.780]  his grave you know he's burning in Hades here it is
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:35.420]  I mean you gotta see the video folks and we pray for another such outpouring of
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:40.060]  just masses of people all got uniforms though the more poor your country is the
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:44.540]  more tyrannical the more uniforms the more festoonering the more grand
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:50.620]  saloons to quote Kurt Vonnegut the more empty mindlessness but just begging
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:56.860]  oh he makes the sunshine he built the country the total failure of the state
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:03.940]  everywhere Romania Russia Cuba the list goes on and on but only in the West
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:07.500]  sucking off the great Western culture could big government survive as long
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:12.740]  but now it's gotten greedy hundred plus percent tax rates in France against the
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:15.820]  middle class to knock out and bankrupt their competition as the Socialist
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:19.540]  Party is caught being totally taxed exempt but if you try to go off overseas
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:23.340]  or offshore legally to protect yourself they say you're a demon to keep their
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:27.140]  money here so they can take it all joining us a little bit in the next
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:32.620]  hour is Doug Casey of Casey research calm read his books years ago I don't know
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:38.140]  how many 1825 I forget weeks number one New York Times bestseller the
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:43.100]  international man right on the money another bestseller totally incorrect
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:47.740]  Doug Casey he's got a glass of beer and a cigar on the front totally he was a
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:52.140]  man and a white man on top of it main feminist group came out yesterday and
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:56.140]  said a man and woman kissing statue to declare victory over Japan the famous
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:00.140]  sailor kissing the nurse that's rape it's got to be banned I'll probably cut it
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:04.340]  down because it's about the outrageousness it's not that they don't
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:07.700]  know it's over the top it's about total control so before we get into the
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:12.540]  economy take your calls before we get into Russia and where and where Doug
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:16.300]  Casey sees the world going before we get into all that I want to talk about the
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:22.820]  cult of political incorrectness where it's going where now you can't have any
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:28.860]  type of costume party because someone will say that it's racist he's the
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:32.540]  chairman of Casey research bestselling author world-renowned speculator and
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:36.020]  libertarian philosopher Doug Casey has garnered a well-earned reputation for
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.860]  his insights into politics economics and investment markets Doug is widely
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:43.340]  respected as one of the preeminent authorities on rational speculation
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:47.260]  especially in the high potential natural resource sector Doug literally wrote
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.860]  the book on profiting from periods of economic turmoil which were entering his
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:55.780]  book crisis investing spent multiple weeks number one of the New York Times
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.620]  bestseller I'm not going to get into his tens of millions of books sold or all
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:03.180]  the rest of it he's back with us and thank you for coming on while I've been
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:07.700]  ranting sir we're gonna skip this break one more so we give you plenty of time
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:11.340]  right here this network break coming up station shouldn't cover this but Doug you
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.580]  heard my rant people need to know political correctness not from my view
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:21.340]  but from their own documents Edward Bernays 80 something years ago said we
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:26.020]  gotta merge Hollywood with with with with the political class we've got a roll
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:30.100]  out and say the stars are for gun control the stars are for slavery you've
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:34.020]  got to be for it just like they put Kim Jong-il on TV in North Korea and have
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:39.340]  women running up begging for him it's a parlor trick where they set up on MSNBC
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:44.060]  and say your kids belong to the state men are bad inherently I mean why don't we
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:49.460]  just laugh at these vomit this horrible gutter snipes who are flaming
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:54.460]  authoritarians I mean it is so over the top that I can't even at this point it's
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:18:00.020]  such a cult it's such a joke and people are so scared of what Rachel Maddow with
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:06.140]  no audience has to say why are these pathetic sacks of do-nothing parasitic
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:13.820]  mind manipulators able to continue this and for how long well Alex I absolutely
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:19.980]  and totally agree with everything you said except for one thing you said you
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:25.780]  called what you were saying a rant I wouldn't do that because I would say
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:35.340]  what what you've just been giving us is an impassioned defense of a set of ideas
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:39.660]  but the fact that it's impassioned doesn't mean that it's a rant I totally
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:44.940]  agree with you it's it's an attempt at survival these people are assaulting us
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:53.260]  they suck dry every country they enter oh yeah I agree it's why is the world
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:59.500]  turning in this direction I'm asking myself I it seems to me at this point
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:10.020]  the most Americans have been transformed into with dogs and I guess the
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:15.700]  reason for that is that half of all Americans at this point are net
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:23.940]  recipients of money and benefits and that's from the from the government
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:30.460]  and it's transferred them it's just changed them into with dogs from human
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:36.540]  beings I love dogs personally but I don't like people that act like dogs so
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:42.420]  um I don't I don't see what will change the trend that's what really disturbs
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:50.380]  me it's bad enough that these people seem to have control of the media and have
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:56.020]  control of the universities and have control of the government but and I hate
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:00.380]  to be pessimistic but I don't see what's gonna turn the trend around at this
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:08.220]  point that do you not unless there's a huge wake-up call well I think we're
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:13.500]  gonna get a wake-up call in the form of an economic collapse in the next two
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:18.900]  years because we touched on this a little bit when we spoke a couple of
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:25.500]  weeks ago and that was the fact that things nearly came on the blues in 2007
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:31.740]  2008 but they were able to paper it over by creating trillions of literally
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:39.580]  trillions of new currency units and that's made people feel richer than they
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:46.140]  really are and it's caused them to continue doing the things that caused
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:53.580]  the collapse of 2007 2008 but I think we're on the edge of another collapse
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:59.060]  at this point it's gonna be much more serious so the wake-up call that you're
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:05.420]  talking about I think it's gonna come in the form of an economic disaster that
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:08.900]  we're right on the edge of now I want to break down the technicals of that
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:12.540]  government is running around like a chicken with its head cut off gearing
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:18.140]  up to protect itself but not the people and planning to capitalize from the
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:23.540]  crisis it's not immoral for us who are trying to stop it to also prepare to
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:29.380]  morally do things that protect ourselves and our family like you said a few weeks
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:33.860]  ago charity starts at home but first let's go through the technicals no major
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:37.620]  economists that I've seen denies now that they can inflate their way out of
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:42.980]  this is it going to be recessionary or depressionary or will it be inflationary
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:47.860]  hyperinflation or will we see something more akin to hyper stag inflation
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:54.460]  well here's the way I break it down you've got the monetary situation you
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:59.780]  can have inflation where the dollar loses value and prices rise or deflation
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:07.460]  where the dollar gains value and price dropped now which is it going to be for
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:14.380]  many many many years we've had constant inflation year after year the dollar
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:23.460]  lost 90% of its value in real terms since the 1960s can we have a deflation at
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:30.620]  this point it's possible because let's suppose the stock market collapses
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:34.980]  tomorrow that would wipe out trillions of dollars of funny money represented by
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:40.500]  the stock market suppose there is an unbelievable amount of debt in the world
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:46.260]  today that people count as assets suppose that that can't be serviced and
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:52.100]  bonds be fault that trillions more dollars that are wiped out suppose the
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:57.780]  real estate market collapses because the real estate market is built on a on a
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:03.740]  exploding on a sea of debt so that can wipe out trillions of dollars and the
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:08.420]  US dollar could become worth more for a period of time the problem is that what's
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:14.100]  going to happen then is that Washington would grab the economy in a
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:19.540]  stranglehold and create trillions more dollars they can create an unlimited
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.500]  number of them so in the long run we have to count on much higher levels of
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.180]  inflation even though deflation is possible but there's something else you
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:37.060]  brought up and the opposite of a depression not inflation the opposite of
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:44.140]  depression is prosperity and the problem is that the standard of living in the
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:50.020]  US has been dropping for many years it's been dropping rapidly against other
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:54.580]  countries that have been coming up in the world but now it's dropping in
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:24:01.740]  absolute terms when you deflate the dollar and make it constant dollars
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:08.060]  over the last 10 years the median income of the average American family has
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:14.900]  dropped from $58,000 to $51,000 so the real standard of living has gone down a
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:21.180]  lot the pay has gone down double whammy while inflation's gone up so it's
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:25.100]  really more like they're getting paid $40,000 now instead of $53,000 well it's
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:30.140]  even worse than that because with the US government on the ragged edge of well
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:36.460]  it is bankrupt I mean running the $600 billion per year deficit they can only
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:42.700]  get the money by borrowing more by taxing or by inflating the currency
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:49.460]  that's the three ways they can get money so taxes are one of the one of the
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:55.300]  three legs of the tripod so even though the dollars people are being paid are
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:00.740]  worth less more of them are being taxed as they go into higher brackets in
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:05.220]  addition there's no way out of it the government has been living way above its
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:12.100]  means with welfare and warfare I mean just the wars that we've had in the
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:16.540]  Middle East for the last 10 years are alone enough to bankrupt the country I
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:21.860]  mean that's real capital that's being shipped over there and destroyed well
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:29.300]  even worse than destroyed captured and now used against American troops that
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:33.420]  they go over there which would be idiotic if not like it's only going to
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:41.060]  rile the natives more make them hate Americans more and and impel them towards
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:46.020]  bringing the war here to the US so there's really no way out of it at this
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:51.260]  point nobody nobody talks about disengaging from these insane tribal
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:56.740]  wars in the Middle East they talk about how we can re-engage in them I mean
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.820]  they're not just doing the wrong thing they're doing the exact opposite but it's
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:05.140]  the right thing for the military industrial complex that has made tens of
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:09.460]  trillions of dollars just the last few decades alone funding and radicalizing
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:15.940]  Islamist groups and others well a lot of it is insider crony groups who don't
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:20.540]  care about the larger prosperity of the world in fact they see prosperity
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:24.780]  outside of their systems is competition so they work for policies to shut down
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:29.540]  their competition while creating monopoly combines for themselves what
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:37.460]  would you call this monopoly system well I don't call it capitalism Alex that's
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:45.660]  a misnomer capitalism is the system of free minds and free markets if you can
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:50.820]  use a strictly Marxist breakdown actually because most people are unaware of the
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:56.420]  fact that Karl Marx actually coined the world the word capitalism originated
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:03.740]  with Karl Marx that's right so what is capitalism das kapital right exactly
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:09.340]  so what is capitalism it's a it's a system a Marxist correctness respect I
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:16.540]  mean everything he said wasn't wrong most of it was of course but capitalism
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:22.060]  is the system where the means of production factories arms think of that
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:28.900]  maybe in the hands of the people but well our own privately owned privately
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:35.620]  it's not government not government and also where consumer goods houses cars
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:43.140]  are privately owned and privately controlled that's capitalism now it's
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:50.420]  often confused with fascism people think of fascism and they think of the
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:55.620]  Nazis and jackboots this type of thing that's got nothing to do really with
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:28:01.740]  fascism the economic system which not employed of course fascism which is
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:07.220]  what we have in this country that's right is a system where all of the means
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:14.420]  of production are owned privately they are controlled by the state and where
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:20.060]  consumer goods are owned privately they're controlled by the state that's
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.980]  right you have a private car but it's really registered to the state and is
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:26.940]  really there you supposedly own a house but you pay a rent on it we didn't have
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:31.700]  any of this a hundred years ago so it's the illusion of ownership why would the
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:36.420]  ultra-rich then in many cases want to go for this because the state will create
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:44.460]  monopolies for them well exactly and it's the ultra-rich for that can hire the
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:50.060]  lawyers to juggle the interpretations of the laws in their favor to hire the
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:55.980]  accountant to reduce their taxes can afford to bribe the politicians to get
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:01.580]  things changed in ways that they like so that's why the rich are getting rich
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:06.220]  at this point and by the way I have mainline accounting firms tax lawyers
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.100]  you name it I spend almost all the money that comes in here to fund the
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:13.740]  operation because I want to get the word out a b though since Obama got in with
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:17.980]  the tax changes before with all the write-offs that have been gotten rid of
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:22.940]  and stuff I paid about 50% federal tax not 40 like they were saying folks now
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:33.100]  it's more like 70% for folks that don't know you're you're well you're right because social security taxes and the percentage of your
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:38.740]  income keep going up and the level to which they go up keeps rising and if you
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.540]  got a company and a bunch of employees they they call that an asset even though
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:45.660]  it's not it's incredible they penalized building we'll be back with Doug Casey

[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:39.620]  actually quoted marks and I just decode things automatically when I said oh
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:43.940]  capitalism is when the means of production are with the people well
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:50.420]  technically in the deception of das kapital which I read over at 15 years
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:54.620]  ago the communists are saying that it's with the people but it's really the
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:58.300]  state so when I say it's with the people that that's me saying capitalism
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:02.820]  would be with individuals with the private sector so it's it's always
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:07.580]  changing the terms and manipulating them but if you read what Karl Marx wrote
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:12.180]  and what others wrote early communist thinkers they said the means of
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:15.180]  production will come up to such a point the state will wither away because it'll
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:19.860]  be so many goods but see they never allowed in this collectivist hybrid
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:23.420]  model of fascism and socialism and communism all mixed together for
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:26.620]  different strata of society because the globalists are exempt from the stuff
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.340]  they do to us that's the key to all this the real discrimination while they have
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:33.300]  us fighting over race and color and religion all day it's just they're
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:38.700]  cheating everybody and don't want us to realize that is that we should be working
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:42.820]  two three days a week we should be a culture based on art and excellence so
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:46.340]  they're always trying to raise taxes and shut down competition to create
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:50.940]  artificial scarcity and that's not my opinion that's the writings of Ezekiel
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:56.140]  Emmanuel and Cloward and Piven and Jenna 21 and the UN and all their thinkers I
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:35:01.060]  want to talk to Doug Casey about that in a moment and take your calls but the
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:05.220]  toll-free number on any question you want to talk about free market Ebola Russia
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:09.580]  with Doug Casey great places he's lived around the world I guess more than 10
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:13.340]  countries traveled over a hundred he says he's very famous for that back in
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:16.740]  the 70s at the best selling book the international man has his new books out
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:20.980]  right on the money and totally incorrect you can find it tells the Casey
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:27.740]  research calm but before we go any further I jump on things and last week
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:32.780]  we were a couple weeks ago we were calling Obama obolo and then we were
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:39.220]  even I even had him looking at t-shirt last week that was the Obama symbol the
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:44.180]  rising Sun of Satan or whatever it is in the in the O of Ebola and then suddenly
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:48.100]  bumper stickers showed up and came an actual news story in California we have
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:51.220]  them coming they're being manufactured right here in the US being printed right
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:54.540]  now so it's not really a pre-order you just order them and we should get in a
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:58.100]  few weeks you should get it very quickly after that a week or so after we've got
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:02.300]  two different ones one that says Ebola on the front with the Obama symbol on the
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:07.060]  back it says obola and then another one that says the same thing with blood
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:11.700]  splatters fake blood splatters on the front and back to desecrate the state's
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:16.660]  god Kim Jong-un or Barack Obama and just as Kim Jong-un is a puppet of the
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:21.700]  horrible military dictatorship and hermit dictatorship proto royalty of
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:28.300]  North Korea so is Obama and the attempt to sell the state as sexy and cool and
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:34.860]  really hot and trendy I get excited around inventors I get excited around
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:41.340]  people I know that from nothing ended up you know renting out dozens of
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.940]  apartments and high-rises and furnishing them and personally doing and
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.460]  cleaning it themselves and renting it out to people that visit town and then
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:52.700]  ended up buying you know whole buildings I know a young lady like in six seven
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:56.740]  years has done that from nothing I mean literally cleaning all the toilets
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:00.300]  herself working 18 hours a day and now you know years later becoming very
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:05.460]  wealthy I mean I just admire that artist researchers musicians that are
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:10.580]  successful on their own right anything establishment sold or hyped is the
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:14.700]  opposite of Americana the opposite of trailblazing the opposite of Renaissance
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:21.780]  it makes me want to puke quite frankly so I do want to desecrate there's a
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:26.900]  slang term for it but what a dog does a fire hydrant I want to do that on the
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:31.500]  the fake deity that is the state and Obama is just one manifestation of that
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:36.180]  and that's where I stand so we've got the t-shirts in we're only printing 3,000
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:41.340]  of them and when they're gone 3,000 of each design when they're gone they're
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:45.900]  gone just like the original Joker who just was selling you know thousands a
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:49.460]  week but I said it's limited edition when it sold out it sold out we've got all

[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:43.660]  okay one thing I try to do there I try to do the same thing that you do is try
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:49.580]  to get people to stop apotheosizing the state people look for the state to do
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:55.860]  everything they they think politically in fact people are supposed to be voting
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:40:04.180]  in in a week or so whatever I don't know I don't vote and this may shock some of
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:09.460]  your listeners to say that I don't vote but when I was on the Phil Donahue show
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:14.500]  when Phil was the Oprah this day I happened to be on for a full hour by
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:20.300]  myself the day before the national election in 1980 when Reagan was running
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:28.460]  against I forget who was running again but so Phil asked me I suppose you're
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:32.900]  going to be voting for Mr. Reagan tomorrow and I said no I'm not voting for
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:37.420]  Reagan and I gave him some reasons why I didn't like Reagan and we could talk
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:46.260]  about that too because actually he was a nice guy personally I'm sure but really
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:51.300]  just a politician that made some gigantic mistakes but then Phil said well
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:56.140]  you're not voting for Carter that's who you're voting against so you must be
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:01.340]  voting for the libertarian and I said no I'm not voting for anybody and I started
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:07.500]  to give him five reasons why nobody should vote and I suggest that nobody
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:16.540]  do vote because the one thing it just supports them you may be voting you're
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:21.620]  really probably just voting against the worst of the two people but you're not
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:27.660]  perceived that way the guy that you vote for think you're actually voting for
[01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:33.780]  him and supporting him not voting against the other guy so I prefer look
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:40.780]  back in the 60s we please say suppose they gave a war and nobody came well
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:45.740]  let's take it further suppose they gave a tax and nobody kept and nobody paid
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:50.980]  suppose they gave an election and nobody voted I'd like to disenfranchise the
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:56.300]  state I don't want to feed them more power so I think that's very important
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:42:02.100]  Alex but people stop thinking politically and stop thinking well the
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:05.780]  government should do this but government should do that this is a problem with
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:13.820]  conservative they want good conservative regulation and conservative
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:19.460]  taxation as opposed to a liberal right but there's no difference between the
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:23.900]  two of them I mean well it's all nuanced I agree with you overall on
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:28.540]  anarchic capitalism's goals and ideas but as Ron Paul has said we're so
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:32.180]  addicted to this now like a heroin addict we've got to be taken off of it
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:36.140]  slowly sometimes you've got to vote out of pure self-defense I know there's
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:39.620]  fraud I know both parties overall end up voting the same just different
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:43.780]  rhetoric and a lot of times I won't vote if it if the candidates are so similar I
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:48.180]  get what you're saying I think what you're really getting at here is we vote
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:51.820]  in the political system when it's probably one of the weakest votes the
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:56.700]  jury box the grand jury box of voting with our dollars you know buying organic
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:01.900]  food to displace the other GMO garbage voting by leaving the country voting by
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:06.860]  civil disobedience of fraudulent taxes not paying them not being part of the
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:11.860]  system that's what will really bring it down but also voting with our mouths
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:19.260]  decrying it saying it's illegitimate it needs us to invite it in like a vampire
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:22.340]  is what I think you're getting at I totally agree with you you stated it
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:26.540]  very well that's quite correct actually I want to fire the phone number out it's
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:37.260]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 open phones for Doug Casey Casey research
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:42.780]  com 800-259-9231 before we go to these callers I know you want to get into
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:47.060]  Russia I want to get into it too an article you pointed to set the Russian
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:51.020]  Empire strikes back and any other issues you want to break down you'll be
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:58.060]  with us 20 minutes in the next hour Doug Casey is our guest Doug did you want
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:01.660]  to elaborate on anything before we got into Russia and phone calls you know
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:05.780]  there is one thing I wanted to say to amplify what we were talking about before
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:13.460]  Alex and that is that there are two types of people in the world people that
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:21.740]  want to control physical reality and manipulate nature create things and I
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:26.820]  like those kind of people and then they're the other kind of people that
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:33.900]  want to control other people and this is the kind of people that go into
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:40.940]  government the kind of people that run for elections are inevitably the kind of
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:47.980]  people that want to control other people and by voting for them you're giving
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:57.100]  them your sanction to control other people including yourself transforming
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:02.340]  three people into web dogs so that's just something I'd like to say about the
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:11.300]  morality of voting I think it's basically immoral but voting in the
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:16.820]  marketplace voting by your actions voting by your speech that's a totally
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:22.220]  different thing you're not using coercion with that type of well it is true
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:27.540]  that that they said a Hollywood star who was working for State Farm as a
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:32.100]  spokesman come out and he said you know democracy always turns into fascism
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:36.260]  and then they basically fired him as a spokesman we was basically quoting
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:40.380]  Thomas Jefferson the two wolves and a sheep you know voting on what's for dinner
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:45.140]  and that's the issue of a republic versus a democracy but all republics
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:49.140]  end up degenerating into a democracy and then into a living hell whatever name
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:53.180]  you want to give it of a status system and clearly we've degenerated into a
[01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:58.780]  democracy now where 50 plus percent can vote to literally enslave the producers
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:04.020]  and then tell us how immoral we are for building the civilization they inhabit
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:11.860]  you know like like like mind scrambled gnomes complaining about the
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:16.420]  civilization that built you know the city they live in even though they've
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:21.300]  never seen who built the world they live on they they damn them for giving them
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:26.700]  oxygen to breathe well like Obama said you didn't build that somebody else
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:31.820]  built that he wants to make everybody feel like a parasite which in fact he
[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:37.220]  is but I've got to say that the kind of people that go into government are not
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:41.860]  the best and the brightest as they always like to say there's a poorest and
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:49.180]  the worst kind of people there um the problem is this too it's that the more
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:56.860]  of the these parasites that go into government the more likely that more
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:02.980]  parasites will go into government and after a while a decent person wouldn't
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:09.540]  even think of it so you have this class of perfectly horrible people that have
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:18.260]  taken over all the power in society it's and we reached that stage right now and
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.740]  that's a cyclical fact and once we reach the bottom of it the veneer of
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:27.260]  civilization will burn away like a heat shield on reentry to the atmosphere
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:36.260]  what comes next after after evil and and control freaks have gotten control of
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:43.300]  every major system well one thing I think it's gonna happen is that the idea
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:52.060]  of democracy is going to be debunked it's like democracy has become a secular
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:58.580]  god in this country where it's like mother and apple pie and democracy but
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:02.460]  people don't really understand what they're talking about when they say
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:09.140]  that democracy in effect is nothing but mob rule dressed up in a sports coat
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:19.340]  that's all it is it's it's a lynch mob it's 51% of the people get to turn the
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:26.700]  other 49% into sacrificial animals so I'm not a fan of democracy I'm a fan of
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:31.860]  freedom and those two things should not be completed sure for those that don't
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:36.780]  know we're supposedly a republic which has laws that can't be violated to
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:40.660]  protect the individual and then and then within a narrow spectrum we can vote
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:45.420]  then for representatives and others and clearly government's been part of human
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:49.980]  development but but so often it is a destructive force not a good force and
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:53.460]  we know in its latter stages always becomes destructive I mean it's not
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:58.700]  like we're speculating here Doug no we're not actually and when we talk about
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:04.380]  laws I mean the most basic law of the land is the Constitution there are
[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:09.260]  problems with the Constitution in my opinion but I really am a big fan of the
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:15.660]  Bill of Rights unfortunately the whole Constitution is a dead letter at this
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:22.180]  point it has been interpreted out of existence that's right by practice they
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:26.900]  have overrun it and shredded it and destroyed it and and use it for bird
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:34.060]  cage liner exactly and if at any point you bring up the Constitution as the
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:40.100]  basic law of the land they're looked upon as being a dangerous radical they'll
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:44.940]  call you a terrorist imagine this though it's not perfect some shield against
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:49.040]  rampant tyranny and people giggle and disdain at it like it's
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.820]  intellectual to to literally destroy their parachute I mean they're burning
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:50:00.180]  down their house dancing on their graves giggling at the folly yeah it
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:07.140]  really it really is quite disturbing and you know after the next real or
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:16.620]  imagine a terrorist incident in this country I wonder Alex if we'll even be
[01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:25.660]  able to talk on the airwaves and say these things I wonder about that they
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:29.820]  openly say they want to shut us up we're the bad people that talk about
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:35.180]  freedom and other dirty things yeah Doug Casey's our guest we're gonna take 20

[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:14.100]  crisis were never fixed in fact they're even worse now the total amount of debt
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:19.860]  in the US is grown by more than 57% since September 2008 the two big to fail
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:24.380]  banks are much larger and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:28.300]  out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:32.260]  landing that is inevitably coming if you're a baby boomer with retirement
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:36.700]  funds it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash

[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:19.580]  these headlines really are incredible Libs claim using the term obolo which I'm
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:23.420]  sure I didn't coin but I thought of myself then I heard everybody else using it
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:27.980]  I don't think they got it for me it's just common sense obolo I mean it's it's
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:33.380]  not hard to come up with that but Libs claim using the term obolo is racist
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:38.620]  no we're a cool he's leaving the borders wide open they claim there's a
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:40.620]  government but then they leave it wide open when they want because they're
[01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:44.060]  globalist and then meanwhile they're letting everybody flying from these
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:47.020]  countries and everybody else has banned it we're just pointing out that they
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:50.300]  want this crisis to obviously break loose here in the country and then meanwhile
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:56.660]  Jesse Jackson says Dallas patients a bowl of death due to racism I mean it's
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:55:00.620]  just everything so that's some of the stories Michael Savage was up yesterday
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:04.460]  he breaks down the fact they want to cause a civil war in this country yoga
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:09.540]  studio here in Austin a big one cancels costume party for Halloween after
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:14.660]  claims of racism because someone might come as something unauthorized that is
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:19.500]  the type of issues HHS secretary says there may be other cases of Ebola in
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:24.620]  the US like we need them to tell us that continuing and how to exercise your
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:28.580]  rights in an unconstitutional checkpoint powerful video on that that's some
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:33.060]  of the stories up on info wars calm and prison planet calm Doug Casey's with us
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:37.260]  20 minutes to the next hour we got calls for him let's go to Washington State
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:42.860]  and Woody Woody you're on the air go ahead you got a question or comment for
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:49.780]  Doug Casey yes Alex I do mr. Casey I believe Russia is much stronger
[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:53.860]  economically and militarily and actually culturally than the United States
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:58.300]  right now and I believe we're on a collision course deliberately to take
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:03.460]  us into World War 3 and I'd like to know what events you see Russia taking on a
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:09.180]  proactive level as far as our economy because we are vulnerable there if that
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:16.500]  was to happen well that's a good question I don't think that Russia is
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:23.860]  stronger economically militarily but then than the US the country has half the
[01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:30.100]  population that we do and the economic system there is not very entrepreneurial
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:35.740]  at all but they're not focusing on teaching five-year-old boys how to
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:39.580]  wear dresses so I think culturally he's saying that it's it's hard to believe
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:44.260]  that Russia in some ways is is more Western or less mentally ill than we
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:49.340]  are now well there's something to be said for that and the leader of Russia
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:56.660]  Vladimir Putin is is actually a manly man he's not a wimpy little girly man
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:57:01.700]  like our like our president if I hope somebody doesn't accuse me of racism
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:06.460]  because I because I called Obama a wimpy little girl I mean actually
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:10.380]  sacrilege and blasphemy he's a god you didn't hear Jamie Foxx said that he's
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:18.460]  the Lord and Savior no really I am sorry to hear that I like Jamie Foxx as an
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:22.820]  actor but of course just because you like somebody's technical skills on the
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:27.060]  screen doesn't mean that you endorse their political and philosophical views
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:33.820]  but to answer the question it's that no I don't think Russia is a threat and
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:40.660]  actually when it comes to this this dust up in the Ukraine I really think that
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:48.060]  the US is the troublemaker there and is causing a problem not the Russian I mean
[01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:53.180]  Ukraine isn't a real country to start with that's kind of like an area where
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:58.140]  most of the people speak Ukrainian as opposed to Russian or several other
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:05.260]  languages so it's natural enough that the people on the Western borders of the
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:09.900]  Ukraine and those two provinces want to be closer to the Russians and the
[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:14.460]  Russians like that because it's nice to have a well you do have an article at
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:17.620]  kcresearch.com that I want to get into when we come back and we'll go back to

[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:45.260]  the hour Doug Casey's our guest till 20 after taking phone calls the author of
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:49.980]  the International man leading anarchy capitalist libertarian issue could call
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:55.500]  him have a lot of accurate predictions and forecasting finish up with Russia
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:59.660]  we're gonna go to fill in Florida this article from Casey research the Russian
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:06.060]  Empire strikes back how are they striking back with world energy well one
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:11.780]  of the guys that I work with his name is Marin Katusa fantastic speculator
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:20.260]  brilliant young guy and he's written a book called the Cold War and I urge
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:25.620]  your listeners to read that book he'll go into he goes into a lot of these
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:33.900]  things in detail but going back to Russia for a moment I'm all for those two
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:41.260]  breakaway provinces from the Ukraine Lugansk and the next just as I was all
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:47.340]  for this the South breaking away from the U.S. during the war between the
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:52.780]  state I'd like to see seven billion little nation states in the world and
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:58.420]  the more the merrier it'll give individuals more control as nation
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:04.740]  states get smaller so I want to go the opposite direction of the European
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:10.700]  Union I'd like to see a thousand little countries in Europe perhaps one of them
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:16.500]  might actually be free exactly not big giant super states are almost always a
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:20.180]  more oppressive but lots of little states to compete with each other with
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:23.460]  lower taxes and freedom creating real diversity
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:30.260]  precisely so that there's every reason to support the rebels in those two
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:36.060]  breakaway provinces in the Ukraine and the fact that the the Russians are on
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:41.780]  their side and helping them that's fine but certainly the United States has no
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:46.020]  business at all sticking its nose into what's happening in a part of the world
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:52.140]  that most Americans can't even find on a map 75% of Eastern Ukraine is Russian
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:56.380]  about a third of Western Ukraine is for most of its history as you know Doug it's
[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:59.980]  been part of Russia that's not some Russia worshipping statement it's just
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:04.260]  facts they've got neocons that call me a Russian agent because I'm against
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:08.980]  starting war with Russia so George Soros can turn that place you know into
[02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:11.940]  another one of his little palaces where they put five-year-old boys in dresses
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:17.140]  no exactly Russia is certainly no bastion of freedom but it is no longer a
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:26.820]  communist country either and the top income tax rate in Russia is 10% that's
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:32.620]  it 10% unbelievable so in many ways Russia is now freer than the US
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:39.740]  if folks only knew they only ran an operation like a business like I do
[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:44.980]  which run this is a business to finance it they just have no idea what a real
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:49.260]  middle-class or Nuva region entrepreneur goes through I mean the taxes are over
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:53.620]  80% you add them all together unless you engage in you know squarely stuff like
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:57.060]  the globalist and then they selectively enforcing into you where it's hard to do
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:04:01.860]  unless you completely leave the country yeah and I'm very disturbed about the
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:08.420]  demonization of Russia and China and so many other countries by the US
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:14.180]  government because it was a brutal turner that said a hundred years ago war is
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:19.020]  the health of the state that's right and that is so true because when there's a
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:23.980]  war that's the perfect excuse for the state to pass more laws and more
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:30.180]  restrictions and taxes so in general chaos is the health of the state not
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:37.380]  just war and I'm very anti-war that's right they want chaos so they can
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:41.700]  orchestrate run the whole thing and solid a power milk it and then let the
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:46.420]  chaos continue against their enemies we're going right to fill Isaiah Ron

[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:06.220]  that's Jamie Foxx a decadent overweight most unhealthy lowest IQ you name it the
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:09.940]  United States is at the back of every industrialized nation in a whole bunch of
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:17.180]  third world countries 43rd for economic investment used to be number one but we
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:20.060]  got these arrogant politicians and people to think the whole world should be
[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:27.300]  theirs these are not Americans these are control freaks using our country and
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:31.060]  they've got to be stopped and it is not a thought crime to criticize them like
[02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:38.260]  Jesse Jackson others are saying it is our right and our duty Doug Casey of Casey
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:42.220]  Research is our guest we're taking phone calls right now but you hadn't heard
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:48.220]  that Jamie Foxx clip we've got a whole group of those with people saying I don't
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:51.220]  have to pay for my house or my car anymore I'll get everything free your
[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:56.260]  God and Obama supporters on the street literally believe that he's like a
[02:09:56.260 --> 02:10:01.260]  leprechaun that can give people buckets of gold from nowhere and then it's not
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:06.100]  being taken from somebody else Doug well it's shocking and actually
[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:12.860]  disgusting and I don't like to call anybody a racist but perhaps Jamie Foxx
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:19.660]  is a racist because he's black and Obama's black I mean does that have
[02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:23.620]  anything to do with it is him only white people can be racist it's been proven by
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:33.540]  Al Gore that who also invented the planet that the internet anyway yes well
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:36.420]  there you go it's anyone that disagrees with us as a racist if you're against
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:39.860]  the free market you're racist that well you're against global warming which I
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:48.500]  guess Al Gore you're also a racist the whole thing about racism it's just
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:54.380]  crazy I mean of course people are different from each other and the fact
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:11:03.420]  of the matter is that people birds of feather tend to lock together and the
[02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:11.300]  races of people are like breeds of dogs we're different I mean Irish fetters
[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:16.700]  are good at some things and poodles are good brothers and bulldogs are good
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:23.660]  brother things that be blood different if you're a poodle as opposed to a bulldog
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:27.860]  that doesn't mean you hate bulldogs you just recognize the difference no I like
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:32.420]  bulldogs I like bulldogs I guess that means I'm racist against all their
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:39.500]  breeds of dog these people keep bringing this up and it inflames
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:44.820]  racism they say they hate racism but they really must like race well that's
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:48.420]  all they've got they don't have any real ideas it's just spew racism all day
[02:11:48.420 --> 02:11:53.500]  fill in Florida you're on the air with our guests go ahead hey Alex apparently
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:59.100]  if you've been able to shed the grease from your public education then you're
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:05.100]  racist that's right the I just wanted to thank mr. Casey for coming on today I
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:09.140]  have all the guests that you have on here and I almost always agree with you
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:15.180]  99.9% time but this guy so far everything he said is to me right on
[02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:22.340]  it's particularly about fascism and the way that the the school is they don't
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:26.300]  even teach people what fascism is anymore because they want you to think
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:30.700]  that it's capitalism yeah no they want to scapegoat I agree with you
[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:38.300]  capitalism for this crony fascist pick the winner insider gangster system that
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:46.740]  we're under yes when you use words inaccurately or incorrectly it clouds
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:51.740]  your thought because if you don't know exactly what a word means and you can't
[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:56.620]  actually know what you're talking about that's what Orwell talked about you right
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:13:03.140]  when you're right out exactly love this hate and so forth precisely correct and
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:06.540]  he was talking about in that book in stock the Fabian socialists in England that
[02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:09.740]  he was part of how they want to destroy the language when he finally got into
[02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:12.660]  their upper groups and he found they were really just a bunch of criminal
[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:15.940]  predators who wanted to be the only people that could think that's when
[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:19.460]  Orwell turned against them simply amazing thank you Phil Ron and Canada
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:25.420]  you're on the air with Doug Casey yes hi Doug how are you good thanks I got a
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:32.260]  question about propaganda yeah talking about Edward Bernage propaganda is the
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:37.720]  executive arm of the invisible government and it also talks about the
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:41.620]  group mind if we understand the mechanisms and motives of the group mind
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:46.220]  it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:50.540]  will without them knowing it I want to know about the group mind if you could
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:54.380]  talk about that what is it sure you're bringing up the 1930s book propaganda by
[02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:59.540]  Edward Bernage the top psych warfare chief of the status here in the US your
[02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:05.180]  your take just on general hive minding mob mentality they're trying to
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:11.820]  engineer and everybody Doug well I may be a genetic freak from that point of
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:21.260]  view but the fact is all of us tend to run with the herd when you if you're the
[02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:26.340]  only person in an audience that disagrees with what with what the speakers
[02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:33.180]  saying chances are you're going to be quiet about it because the rest of the
[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:39.260]  mob might tear you apart it's tough to be a contrarian in the investment world
[02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:44.820]  it's very tough in the social world it's very tough in the intellectual world
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:50.540]  it's very tough to think for yourself it's much easier just go along with the
[02:14:50.540 --> 02:15:01.260]  crowd than the herd so propaganda is a huge importance to to the deep state you
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:07.620]  might call it because you know the thought is what gives rise to the action
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:12.740]  and you don't even want people thinking I mean first you have a thought and then
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:16.540]  you say something and then you have an action book you don't want people to
[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:24.220]  think out of the box or say anything that runs counter because God forbid they
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:31.020]  might take action at that point but I can't help it I was born a contrarian
[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:34.820]  well we've got to be contrarian when you're dealing with a bunch of crazy
[02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:39.380]  control freak nutballs yelling against common sense I mean this is about
[02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:43.180]  victory over the truth is what the status they're pushing victory over
[02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:47.900]  common sense victory over reality we must counter them and people think you
[02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:52.300]  get heat when you do that sometimes you do but when when people are sick of the
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:57.860]  globalist folks actually come to your aid when everybody's already sold out to
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:02.820]  the system for so cheap it's good to go against it even if you're not moral folks
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:06.980]  in my experience at this point in the game it's not good to go along with a
[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:11.020]  with a train going over the edge of the cliff Doug well not only that Alex but
[02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:17.460]  you've got to live with yourself sure you could run with that stupid herd of
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:22.820]  will to be out there and I give you some protection from the predator for a
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:27.340]  while thing you for a while but you know if you're intelligent you've got it
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:31.380]  moral you've got to live with yourself and that means you have to do the right
[02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:36.820]  thing regardless of what the consequences are so I'm not interested in
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:40.940]  being just another one of the stupid will to be out there that running with
[02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:44.620]  the herd yeah humans are not wilder beasts that but they're trying to
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:48.860]  engineer us into that component so that we can be fed on as the herd because
[02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:53.220]  with humans being in the herd doesn't even afford the safety of a wilder
[02:16:53.220 --> 02:17:02.220]  beast or of a schooling sardine now you're you're right but the people that
[02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:08.740]  like to control other people want to see us all as milk cows exactly you know
[02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:13.540]  we'll we'll stand there and let them take 40 or 50 percent of what we produce
[02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:24.620]  and if if things go a certain way they might even turn us into beef cows that's
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:28.780]  right feeding cows thank you Ron Ray in California on the air with Doug Casey
[02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:34.420]  hello yes okay first of all I want to state that I believe this is all
[02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:38.860]  containment for extermination like I said before another comment next point for
[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:42.460]  the United States they want to buy a holocaust which I believe is Ebola and
[02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:48.660]  subsequent nuclear holocaust Ukraine as to Syria and I want the question is is
[02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:52.260]  what do you think Putin's going to do now the guess of by the thing on two
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:18:01.340]  fronts Ukraine as to Syria then Iran well look if I was a Martian and I came
[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:06.580]  down and looked at the situation on this planet at this time I would hold
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:12.740]  Putin to be relatively I mean sure he's just a politician and he's basically the
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:17.420]  dictator of Russia at this point and so forth yes and I think he's a good guy but
[02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:22.180]  I'll say this if I was a Martian and looked at the situation objectively I
[02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:28.820]  would have to put Putin on the right side of these issues and the US on the
[02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:33.340]  wrong side of the issue and it's a very sad thing to have to come to that
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:37.140]  well the Martian would also conclude there was a technocratic scientific
[02:18:37.140 --> 02:18:41.780]  anti-free market elite that was playing humanity off against each other in
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:45.980]  balkanization and trying to dumb down and hurt the species as a prey animal
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:50.980]  and the Martian would conclude that we have a predator species or a parasite
[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:57.940]  species a subgroup of humans sociopaths psychopaths the opposite of chivalry
[02:18:57.940 --> 02:19:03.460]  literally growing like a cancer through human civilization you know Alex that's
[02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:08.380]  an interesting point because actually you could make the case that people may
[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:15.300]  be speculating on mental ground because some of these people like well you
[02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:20.500]  mentioned Rachel Maddow I could no longer meet with her intellectually and
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:26.060]  philosophically then I could meet with the chimpanzee physically I wonder if
[02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:31.060]  people are actually speaking mentally let's do one more segment but it's
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:34.220]  observation can you go to the bottom of the hour just 10 more minutes
[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:38.500]  all right break we'll come back six more minutes I want to finish on that the
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:42.740]  so-called global elite believe that they are splitting off another species you
[02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:47.140]  can look at it one and guardian you name it this is their delusion well then
[02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:51.460]  they're they're degrading into something not as good as we were because I just
[02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:54.900]  can't imagine wanting to dominate and wreck everybody and dump everybody down
[02:19:54.900 --> 02:19:58.580]  but you don't just see that in the so-called elite you see the general

[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:32.180]  future in many respects final segment with Doug Casey Casey research calm
[02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:36.380]  really appreciate him joining us is spending so much time finishing up your
[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:41.260]  point about speculating or the species breaking into different groups that's
[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:46.020]  what quote liberalism or statism it promotes not having children it
[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:52.180]  promotes anything that degenerates society it I mean I guess you said it
[02:24:52.180 --> 02:24:57.300]  earlier they want chaos because then they can manage it but it really does
[02:24:57.300 --> 02:25:02.580]  seem like a hateful group overall those that support statism they really are
[02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:11.020]  they're just destructive people and I hate to use the word evil which has
[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:24.540]  become so degraded and used so loosely but what is evil it is it is the it's
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:31.980]  the willful destruction of something that has done nothing to deserve being
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:37.540]  destroyed that's right these are these are just horrible people you know it
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:44.940]  has something called Pareto's law the 80-20 rule and my opinion is that you
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:50.380]  know 80% of 20% of your salesmen do 80% of your sales before there's many
[02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:57.700]  applications of the 20 rule or Pareto's law now I'm of the opinion that 80% of
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:07.140]  the human race are basically decent get along go along okay people and then you
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:13.980]  got 20% that are like potential trouble source they can go either way and then
[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:21.900]  you take 20% of that 20% or 4% of the population and these are just active
[02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:28.700]  destructive social paths I mean they're just snakes and then you take 20% of that
[02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:34.060]  20% psycho yeah and the kind of people that become high government officials
[02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:40.460]  and lead the CIA and the NSA and so forth their real push a path like a path so
[02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:48.140]  I think I think it breaks down kind of that way according to Pareto's law but
[02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:53.140]  then there are the top of people that just disgust and disdain the sociopath
[02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:56.980]  control freaks but the problem is those type of individuals are usually lone
[02:26:56.980 --> 02:27:01.300]  wolves something demonized who just want to lead their own lives and don't want
[02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:06.700]  power over others but usually those type of folks have to be absolutely attacked
[02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:11.460]  and suppressed until they finally rise up and historically end up crushing the
[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:20.140]  parasite yeah that's interesting because at this point let's say 50% of the people
[02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:26.300]  in the US have been transformed into whipped dogs because they're living
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:31.420]  off the state but not everybody's a whipped dog you've got something that's
[02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:36.300]  worse than a whipped dog I call them running dogs and those are people that
[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:43.940]  are that are you know working for the state because it's in their best interest
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:49.260]  and then you've got these top dogs on top of everything and I don't know how
[02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:55.060]  many there are maybe a thousand people in this country that presidents of top
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:28:03.940]  universities heads of big agencies top generals very top politicians congressmen
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:08.700]  that are have been there for many makers of committees these are the these are the
[02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:13.780]  top dogs and these are the real push-up has the society and they have control of
[02:28:13.780 --> 02:28:19.820]  it and they're everywhere guys that run big corporations and so forth but have
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:24.540]  risen to the top not because they're productive but because they're good at
[02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:31.740]  corporate politics back slapping and back stabbing that is the way corporate
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:38.020]  politics work so sure they're the types of general electric to pay Obama to put
[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:40.940]  him on the head of the council to shut down all the power plants they don't
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:44.580]  own and then double their profits and coal power plants because all their
[02:28:44.580 --> 02:28:49.620]  competitions shut down they make money out of insider scams and destroying
[02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:55.980]  productivity not out of trailblazing yeah you're right and I know we could talk
[02:28:55.980 --> 02:29:01.180]  about conspiracy theory and I know that you're much more into it than I am my
[02:29:01.180 --> 02:29:06.820]  my own opinion is that it's hard enough for three or four friends to decide what
[02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:10.220]  restaurant to go to not agree it's a conspiracy of culture it's birds of a
[02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:15.100]  feather fly together well yeah I don't believe that there's a guy with a white
[02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:20.140]  cap that's controlling things but these guys all go to the same schools they have
[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:24.420]  the same philosophies they have the same views on life they go to the same
[02:29:24.420 --> 02:29:29.620]  class there's a consensus yeah they yeah there they're a bunch of guys that they
[02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:36.300]  scratch each other's back and unfortunately they control the society
[02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:39.780]  and we've got to identify and they want us look at their puppets we need to look

[02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:31.420]  together by Rob Jacobson and David Knight and others and then after this film
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:37.260]  review we will go back to your phone calls Isaiah and others that are
[02:35:37.260 --> 02:35:41.420]  patiently holding I'm Alex Jones and if you are watching or listening to this
[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:46.740]  transmission you are the hope you are the resistance Congress starring Robin
[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:51.500]  Wright and directed by Ari Fulman has just finished a limited US theatrical run
[02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:56.140]  and is now available for rental online at places like Amazon and iTunes now
[02:35:56.140 --> 02:35:59.140]  when I looked at the trailer I thought this is going to be a film that really
[02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:03.740]  kind of focused on the radical technological changes that are coming as
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:08.820]  we see many jobs in virtually every industry being replaced by artificial
[02:36:08.820 --> 02:36:12.900]  intelligence and robots regardless of what industry you're in whether it's
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:17.660]  manufacturing or service or whether you're working at a low-level job or
[02:36:17.660 --> 02:36:23.940]  even as a professional your job will be impacted if not entirely replaced by new
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:28.900]  technology the Congress explores how this disruptive technology would affect
[02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:33.620]  Hollywood displacing actors even the animators that eventually move their
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:38.940]  digital avatars the movie takes a much broader look at a future dystopian
[02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:43.620]  society where people are essentially enslaved by entertainment where they
[02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:48.820]  live in a virtual existence the irony is is that many people will avoid this
[02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:53.700]  movie or not finish it because they don't find it entertaining enough but
[02:36:53.700 --> 02:36:58.980]  that's how close we are to the dystopian future that it looks at the
[02:36:58.980 --> 02:37:03.180]  Congress is a film that echoes an archetypal warning that's been presented
[02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:08.180]  by many great artists over many decades and that is once we live in a society
[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:13.300]  characterized by fantasy and deception it opens a door to authoritarian
[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:18.920]  dictatorship based loosely on Stanislaw Lemes the future logical Congress
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:24.540]  the stars Robin Wright as herself as an actress whose decisions have so
[02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:28.860]  frustrated the Hollywood machine that they refuse to work with her ever again
[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:34.940]  unless she signs a one-time contract a one-time fee where they will capture her
[02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:40.900]  entire appearance and personality into a digital model now of course she will
[02:37:40.900 --> 02:37:45.420]  never be allowed to ever work again this is something that's going to happen in
[02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:50.820]  many industries as people even professionals work with programmers to
[02:37:50.820 --> 02:37:54.660]  create artificial intelligence that is going to take over their job where they
[02:37:54.660 --> 02:38:00.060]  will never ever work again in their field or area of expertise the Congress
[02:38:00.060 --> 02:38:04.180]  also stars Harvey Keitel as Robin's agent and Danny Houston as Jeff Green
[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:10.420]  president of a major movie conglomerate Miramount films the film begins with
[02:38:10.420 --> 02:38:15.620]  Hollywood's next technological leap forward a completely realistic digital
[02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:19.500]  version of an actor or actress that makes it look like the actor is in the
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:24.380]  film and of course they've used this in a lot of action science fiction films to
[02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:28.900]  replace actors and very dangerous or impossible sequences the sphere of
[02:38:28.900 --> 02:38:32.660]  lights and camera that are shown in the film capturing Robin Wright's image is
[02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:38.220]  an actual device that's already been used but once they go beyond the distant
[02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:43.940]  shots or the small action shots and go to actual virtual actors that's something
[02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:48.140]  that's going to change not only the process of filmmaking but movies in
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:51.980]  general and this is where the Congress really gets interesting after they
[02:38:51.980 --> 02:38:56.860]  flesh out the concept of virtual actors the film jumps 20 years into the future
[02:38:56.860 --> 02:39:01.700]  and ironically even though Robin Wright was very reluctant to be a part of this
[02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:06.420]  digital reality she is the last remaining major Hollywood star that
[02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:10.540]  actually has a real-life person attached to them so she sent to the
[02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:15.700]  futurist Congress and so she selected to be a part of the futurist conference
[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:20.540]  where they're going to announce the next big step forward inhaling an actor's
[02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:26.060]  genetic code creating a controlled hallucination of the actress or movie
[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:31.220]  completely controlled by the unconscious this futurist conference this
[02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:36.140]  Congress is really where the live acting ends and pretty much most of the rest of
[02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:41.980]  the movie is animated and the animation style is kind of a combination of classic
[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:47.940]  animation and modern techniques but it is filled with provocative subliminal
[02:39:47.940 --> 02:39:52.620]  sexual references almost as if they're kind of making fun of the way Madison
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:57.300]  Avenue and the Hollywood studios like Disney have done this in the past at the
[02:39:57.300 --> 02:40:01.580]  Congress the president of Miramount Films reveals the actual plan the
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:06.980]  complete corporate control of all human thought via pharmaceutical technologies
[02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:11.580]  for those who attend the Congress the hallucinations never end because they
[02:40:11.580 --> 02:40:17.100]  put the pharmaceuticals in the drinking water an announcer romanticizes what he
[02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:21.460]  portrays as a utopian future where you can be whatever you want you can do
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:25.380]  whatever you want where you have everything in abundance but of course
[02:40:25.380 --> 02:40:30.620]  it's simply an illusion and if you're a dissenter or if you're defiant in any
[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:35.740]  way you will be eliminated and why should the rollercoaster stop here
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:41.620]  writes characters then moved 70 years into this future a world divided by
[02:40:41.620 --> 02:40:44.980]  those who are part of the mass hallucination world and those who opted
[02:40:44.980 --> 02:40:49.140]  to live life in reality while this part of the movie might seem like pure
[02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:52.900]  science fiction look again the world that's being illustrated here is one
[02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:57.060]  that's been described by top futurists for many decades now Aldous Huxley
[02:40:57.060 --> 02:41:00.660]  famously predicted a world where people learn to love their servitude to the
[02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:07.540]  state through psychotropic and behavior controlling drugs it is possible to make
[02:41:07.540 --> 02:41:13.060]  people contented with their servitude I think this can be done I think it has
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:16.580]  been done in the past but I think it could be done even more effectively
[02:41:16.580 --> 02:41:20.500]  now because you can provide them with bread and circuses and you can provide
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:24.820]  them with endless amounts of distractions and propaganda one look at the
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:28.460]  psychiatric drug industry in America and it will be obvious that for millions of
[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:32.700]  people Aldous Huxley's brave new world is a functioning part of their everyday
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:37.700]  lives heavily influenced by Huxley the reality portrayed by George Lucas and
[02:41:37.700 --> 02:41:43.180]  THX 1138 shows every move and emotion of an ordinary man or woman is
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:47.780]  controlled and regulated pharmaceutically Ray Kurzweil believes that
[02:41:47.780 --> 02:41:51.580]  you'll be able to upload your personality your consciousness to a
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:55.580]  computer once there you'll be able to do anything you want even talk to people
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:41:59.620]  who are long deceased and of course in Ray Kurzweil's case he thinks he's
[02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:04.820]  going to be able to talk to his father who died decades ago and one of the most
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:09.380]  powerful points in the film Robin Wright exits the hallucinogenic animation
[02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:14.420]  and she finds herself in the real world where people are just roaming around in
[02:42:14.420 --> 02:42:20.420]  this gray grim reality like inmates in an asylum because they really only exist
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:25.460]  in an entertainment coma so the question the Congress presents to us is will
[02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:30.060]  people be willing to live in an entertainment utopia but where they're
[02:42:30.060 --> 02:42:35.580]  actually enslaved by technology now technology is just a tool it can be
[02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:39.260]  used for good or for evil and Eisenhower warned us about this with the
[02:42:39.260 --> 02:42:42.780]  military industrial complex saying that it would take over research that it
[02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:48.100]  would take over technology and use it for its own purposes we've seen this
[02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:52.820]  happening as technology accelerates it's increasingly being used for
[02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:59.900]  destruction and for distraction not for production it's being used to enslave us
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:05.060]  not to serve us the Congress could wake up some people about our obsession with
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:09.980]  entertainment if only it were more entertaining from for wars nightly news
[02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:14.180]  I'm David Knight that's right that's from last night's info wars nightly news
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:20.420]  every night seven o'clock central info wars news dot com now I agree with his
[02:43:20.420 --> 02:43:25.300]  review overall it's a complex film I give it on the Paul Revere scale that we
[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:32.100]  should bring back to the movie reviews of one to five horses I would give it
[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:41.020]  five horses for concept for execution I'd give it two and a half they lay out
[02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:45.100]  what bill join others have written about is the actual plan to slowly get us
[02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:50.100]  with the iPhones the apps then the glasses then the contacts then the
[02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:55.740]  implants oh it's so trendy then the full augmentation and then you're just told
[02:43:55.740 --> 02:43:59.020]  by the hype machine that oh they live forever now they're in the machine and
[02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:04.460]  it can mimic who you were enough to fool people as if the elite would actually
[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:09.020]  let you merge with some type of technological computer that could
[02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:13.340]  challenge them they're not going to allow anybody into this but themselves
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:16.700]  and they even discussed the battle they're gonna have as the super being
[02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:20.060]  forms now I don't mean that's really gonna happen before the New York Times
[02:44:20.060 --> 02:44:24.260]  says that I'm saying that I'm saying what curse well in Google and all the
[02:44:24.260 --> 02:44:28.100]  rest of them are up to and Peter feel in his quest for immortality that was in
[02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:33.580]  the London Guardian last week I'll talk about this 20 years ago 18 years ago
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:37.340]  people really thought I was nuts cuz only in MIT publications then now
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:41.540]  they're creating the pop version of this to sell it to everyone but I think the
[02:44:41.540 --> 02:44:48.980]  makers of this we're really trying to help people the film starts with they're
[02:44:48.980 --> 02:44:53.100]  trying to get medical help for her son who is gonna go blind and lose other
[02:44:53.100 --> 02:44:56.660]  senses from a brain disorder and then it turns out at the end the very
[02:44:56.660 --> 02:45:01.060]  scientist in LA that was helping her son and that she went and sold her
[02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:05.780]  identity to Hollywood for to get the money ends up being totally you know
[02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:13.100]  upset and and depressed basically discussing suicide up in one of his
[02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:17.420]  government observation blimps that they spray chemicals on people with saying
[02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:22.620]  we thought it would help people it destroyed everybody and you know the
[02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:27.820]  drugs got stronger and stronger until now 98% of people are in this false
[02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:33.300]  reality and the rest of us are just here looking at the wrecked ruined world but
[02:45:33.300 --> 02:45:36.740]  it also gets into other areas that weren't really mentioned in the review
[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:40.900]  they're not just gonna get rid of the actors or be able to copy their voice
[02:45:40.900 --> 02:45:44.020]  in fact similarly and then type in whatever message they want through those
[02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:48.500]  icons you know further continuing the process of removing humans from any type
[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:57.020]  of not just manufacturing but the arts as well this synthetic system the writers
[02:45:57.020 --> 02:46:01.260]  all go along with it because they're sick of the actresses and actors putting
[02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:04.980]  their own stamp on it or trying to change it which happens constantly in
[02:46:04.980 --> 02:46:10.580]  Hollywood so they're for it at first but then later they are replaced well let
[02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:15.740]  me tell you something the CIA about 30 years ago began working on programs that
[02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:20.260]  were declassified three years ago because they were going mainline where you
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:24.500]  can put the basic data you want in to the computer word processor and then it
[02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:29.420]  writes it and spits it out with different versions to create the illusion
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:33.300]  that different people are writing it so you can put one message out but have it
[02:46:33.300 --> 02:46:38.020]  rewritten 200 different times to be put in newspapers and publications with fake
[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:42.500]  names well there's wired magazine as I said two years ago can an algorithm
[02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:47.380]  write a better news story than a human reporter and it goes on to say that the
[02:46:47.380 --> 02:46:52.380]  CIA developed it well that was two years ago this year 2014 it rolled out and
[02:46:52.380 --> 02:46:57.780]  many of the stories you do read are now written by a CIA robot there's no one
[02:46:57.780 --> 02:47:02.020]  professor 90% of news stories to be written by computers by 2030 no it's
[02:47:02.020 --> 02:47:06.460]  already going on like they said by 2030 all the aircraft will be robot now it's
[02:47:06.460 --> 02:47:11.900]  2020 they always give you a larger date on record than a psych warfare profile I
[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:15.220]  read in the British Ministry of Defense document you can see it everywhere see
[02:47:15.220 --> 02:47:21.220]  they're only using systems to cheat us a real human would show you the tricks and
[02:47:21.220 --> 02:47:25.940]  try to empower you to transcend base manipulation like you want to teach a
[02:47:25.940 --> 02:47:29.980]  five-year-old not to be scared of boogeyman under the couch but in this
[02:47:29.980 --> 02:47:37.500]  artificial arrested development system it the elite themselves are arresting
[02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:42.300]  themselves by trying to not accelerate the rest of humanity there is a
[02:47:42.300 --> 02:47:47.420]  continual feedback loop between all sentient homo sapiens sapiens that has
[02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:52.460]  been documented beyond the sixth sense you could call it karma report you so
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:57.940]  whatever what comes around goes around and that is the great folly of the
[02:47:57.940 --> 02:48:01.620]  current global elite is they do have high intelligence but it's more
[02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:06.740]  mathematical or psychopathic the only humanity to him is that they do have
[02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:10.420]  some lust for death and destruction but I wouldn't even call that human it's
[02:48:10.420 --> 02:48:16.180]  it's more of a mutated version of that but they believe they only look one or
[02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:20.220]  two steps down or they can look hundreds of steps down if it's to dominate and
[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:24.060]  control something but they won't ever look on how those steps affect them some
[02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:28.180]  of the smarter ones will say oh I know it affects me but I like doing this it's
[02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:32.460]  so much fun and those are the really bad ones who will even tell you they know
[02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:36.740]  they're probably gonna blow the planet up but say that that will be my work of
[02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:45.220]  art I did a piece secret homeland security document revealed or video
[02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:49.260]  revealed I don't remember the exact name of it it's the one where I'm the devil
[02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:55.380]  ask do the name of it and it didn't go particularly viral got a few hundred
[02:48:55.380 --> 02:48:59.860]  thousand views on YouTube million saw it here and heard it and people got
[02:48:59.860 --> 02:49:04.980]  deeply disturbed by it because I put a big iron skull helmet on in black and
[02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:11.020]  really talked like the devil really would to his son the Antichrist and it's
[02:49:11.020 --> 02:49:18.780]  kind of a modern take on the screwed take letters of C.S. Lewis book short story
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:22.180]  I guess you could call it not really a short story but it's not that long of a
[02:49:22.180 --> 02:49:27.660]  bucket of reading I was about 12 I've really trying to give you a mind's eye
[02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:35.980]  view into how these guys operate here let me look for it I bet I can find it so
[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:39.180]  expect you guys be able to find something that I can't even think of the
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:44.140]  name of it and people got really freaked out by it because it's like that Alex
[02:49:44.140 --> 02:49:49.100]  must be evil because he can act like that no no I was using my my my
[02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:54.500]  intellectual mimicry of something I have composited of archetypes of evil
[02:49:54.500 --> 02:50:00.700]  trying to warn you not trying to be flashy that I could be scary and be dark
[02:50:00.700 --> 02:50:05.700]  that's the thing I could do pieces that would really wake people up comedy
[02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:09.940]  pieces dark satire pieces but the public is so dumbed down not even so much my
[02:50:09.940 --> 02:50:14.180]  audience but a portion of the audience that's new or doesn't get it that it's
[02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:20.260]  just too disturbing for them when it's only a literary way of trying to get you
[02:50:20.260 --> 02:50:25.980]  to think it's kind of like the Joker and went out to expose Obama and vaccines
[02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:31.060]  people because I was acting evil as the Joker got said he's a good guy how could
[02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:36.500]  Alex be the Joker and be so scary and come off scarier than the Joker and Batman
[02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:40.740]  don't you get it real evil would sit up there and act nice and would never dress
[02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:44.940]  up like the Joker it would come up in the yellow vaults wagon non-threatening
[02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:49.540]  like Ted Bundy I said do we'll know the name or McBreen will so that's the only
[02:50:49.540 --> 02:50:53.180]  way to get I can run over there one of those guys can we'll try to give you the

[02:58:59.540 --> 02:59:03.700]  toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[02:59:03.700 --> 02:59:07.540]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90 percent of their
[02:59:07.540 --> 02:59:11.820]  time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[02:59:11.820 --> 02:59:15.900]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and
[02:59:15.900 --> 02:59:19.860]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[02:59:19.860 --> 02:59:23.060]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[02:59:23.060 --> 02:59:27.100]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my

[03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:43.460]  that's interesting article of an info wars.com right now let's go to your phone
[03:00:43.460 --> 03:00:49.480]  calls Isaiah in California you're on the air go ahead yes my preacher Joseph
[03:00:49.480 --> 03:00:53.820]  Israel says that the devil's new world order is going to claim to bring love
[03:00:53.820 --> 03:00:59.460]  and peace and unity so my question is could the federal government be allowing
[03:00:59.460 --> 03:01:04.580]  Ebola and everything to get so bad so they can come in and offer world peace.
[03:01:04.580 --> 03:01:08.100]  Yeah I mean a whole bunch of crises I don't know if this Ebola is gonna be the
[03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:10.980]  big one but definitely they're gearing up towards that good to hear from you
[03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:15.580]  thanks for holding. Tim in Florida you're on the air. Hey how's it going Alex? Good
[03:01:15.580 --> 03:01:20.580]  brother. Just wanted just wanted to say as far as like a waterfront issues kind
[03:01:20.580 --> 03:01:25.020]  of thing this Ebola stuff it really concerns me only because like you said
[03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:28.380]  so well that it can't be controlled it's something that they just kind of let
[03:01:28.380 --> 03:01:32.420]  loose on the population so that's kind of what concerns me the most about it but
[03:01:32.420 --> 03:01:35.620]  I really wanted to get your take and I wish I was on when Doug was on but I
[03:01:35.620 --> 03:01:40.200]  wanted to ask about what you think about the free man movement the free man on
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:45.020]  the land the sovereignty idea. I think that's very legitimate as long as they
[03:01:45.020 --> 03:01:49.100]  don't engage in their own pseudo paperwork filing and I'm all for pros
[03:01:49.100 --> 03:01:53.140]  saying there's a lot of truth to it just there's also a lot of people making up
[03:01:53.140 --> 03:01:58.060]  stuff that doesn't actually work in court under those names so I'm saying
[03:01:58.060 --> 03:02:02.180]  it's very legitimate overall very illegitimate though because of some of
[03:02:02.180 --> 03:02:05.780]  the people involved so I don't want to just blanket endorse something that'll
[03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:10.620]  get folks into trouble. Absolutely and then I'll get off after this but just any
[03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:13.940]  suggestions you think that would help progress that movement forward because I
[03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:17.660]  see that as a good solution. Well I mean most the laws are unconstitutional
[03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:21.180]  they're not applied to politicians governing class of the illegals so I'm
[03:02:21.180 --> 03:02:24.540]  not telling you what laws are not followed but stuff is not constitutional
[03:02:24.540 --> 03:02:28.740]  it's a duty to not follow tyrannical laws at this point to live your own life
[03:02:28.740 --> 03:02:33.260]  to have a barter economy and to stay out of this parasitic system because this
[03:02:33.260 --> 03:02:37.680]  globalist system is designed to shut down everything and make us dependent. We
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:42.340]  must build things outside the system so there is an infrastructure for humanity
[03:02:42.340 --> 03:02:49.700]  so they can't bring in artificial scarcity writ large aka agenda 21. Awesome
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:52.860]  thank you so much for you and the crew. No brother don't thank me thank the crew
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:57.260]  they're amazing they got to put up with me. Let's talk to TJ because this stuff
[03:02:57.260 --> 03:03:02.020]  on air is not an act what I do on air that's going on behind the scenes. TJ
[03:03:02.020 --> 03:03:08.540]  in Michigan you're on the air welcome. Hi Alex this is TJ and I'm a nurse
[03:03:08.540 --> 03:03:16.820]  retired nurse and disabled dude's 25 years of hard work and also I'm a minister
[03:03:16.820 --> 03:03:24.460]  and if I was listening I've been listening daily and for a long time and
[03:03:24.460 --> 03:03:31.100]  when I look at governmental things I see if you look back at the story of
[03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:37.780]  Jezebel and Ahab you see the spirits of those people in what's happening the I
[03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:42.260]  mean my let's control people I have family that these two spirits were in
[03:03:42.260 --> 03:03:47.020]  and actually has destroyed. Ahab and Jezebel Ahab for men Jezebel for women
[03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:51.460]  and you do the biblical stories literally repeat in our families in
[03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:58.300]  government it's the same story it is a spirit. That's right and the higher up
[03:03:58.300 --> 03:04:02.980]  levels are so involved in the occult mystery religion as Dr. Monteith I was
[03:04:02.980 --> 03:04:07.860]  listening to him today one of his programs job lesson that he had made years ago
[03:04:07.860 --> 03:04:13.180]  and it's all it all comes to fruition if you look at what's happening right now
[03:04:13.180 --> 03:04:18.980]  and as far as the Ebola thing you know so this wouldn't happen back in the
[03:04:18.980 --> 03:04:23.140]  early 1980s when I became a nurse just didn't happen TB was the big thing and
[03:04:23.140 --> 03:04:27.540]  we took every precaution available to us I was an ICU nurse that worked with
[03:04:27.540 --> 03:04:32.100]  unknown viral etiology. Clearly they're violating the web the the the lab rolls
[03:04:32.100 --> 03:04:36.820]  are violating default positions correct. They're violating default positions and
[03:04:36.820 --> 03:04:42.180]  they're also they're also doctors are not stepping up and nurses are starting to
[03:04:42.180 --> 03:04:47.420]  start nurses are starting to see people protest that's right it's we're just a
[03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:52.380]  nation of yes men and women and it's gotta stop it's just it'll grease the
[03:04:52.380 --> 03:04:56.140]  skids to hell thank you so much sorry to Matt Herbert and Eli you call me back
[03:04:56.140 --> 03:05:01.740]  tomorrow I'll get you on Lord Welling nightly news tonight 7 o'clock
