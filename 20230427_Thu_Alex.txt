[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.720]  Fox News host Tucker Carlson ran a lengthy segment last night, arguing the January 6th
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.980]  Capitol attack was not a violent insurrection.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.280]  The tapes show that Capitol Police never stopped Jacob Chansley.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.400]  They helped him.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.880]  They acted as his tour guides.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.880]  Here's video of Chansley in the Senate chamber.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.560]  Capitol Police officers take him to multiple entrances and even try to open locked doors
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.020]  for him.
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.840]  We counted at least nine officers who were within touching distance of unarmed Jacob
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.180]  Chansley.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:07.780]  Not one of them even tried to slow him down.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.780]  Was it a violent insurrection?
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.080]  It was not.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.060]  Was it a killing of five officers in the Capitol?
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.060]  It was not.
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.060]  Those are lies.
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.780]  And they buried tape that contradicted and revealed those lies.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.540]  Rupert Murdoch, who has admitted they were lies and said he regretted it, has a special
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.140]  obligation to stop Tucker Carlson from going on tonight now that he's seen how he has perverted
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.340]  and slimed the truth.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.920]  What they're describing, ironically, is exactly what the January 6th committee and the prosecutors
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.460]  in these cases did for two years.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.060]  They selectively picked small segments of tape to convince Americans that January 6th
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.260]  was something that it wasn't.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.180]  In fact, the leader of the Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, just joined the leader of the
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.060]  Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell, in calling for this show to be pulled off the air.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.580]  Fox News, Rupert Murdoch, tell Carlson not to run a second segment.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.320]  They're on the same side.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.980]  The Senate majority leader joins the Senate minority leader, Tom Tillis, Mitt Romney.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.420]  They're all on the same side.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.940]  So it's actually not about left and right.
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.420]  It's not about Republican and Democrat.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.900]  Here you have people with shared interests.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.700]  The open borders people, the people, the people like Mitch McConnell, who are living
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.580]  in splendor on Chinese money, the people who underneath it all have everything in common
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.540]  are all aligned against everyone else.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.540]  And that would include almost all news organizations in this country as well.
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.980]  The left admits it.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.980]  Tucker says it.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.820]  I help wake him up and radicalizing.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.020]  He gets what's going on.
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.260]  He's not going back.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.980]  He believes in the people.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.140]  And so I predict he won't be at Fox News in the near future if he's unable to put this
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.140]  out.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.540]  Which media voices and media platforms are most influential in shaping the thinking of
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.540]  middle America?
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.700]  You know, once a week, I worry that something terrible will happen to Tucker Carlson, because
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.580]  I think that if it did, we would be in a much, much worse position as a movement.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.860]  For too long, I participated in the culture where I was like, anyone who thinks outside
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.000]  these pre prescribed lanes is crazy.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.520]  Tucker Carlson is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.320]  And when you look at what Tucker Carlson and some of these other folks on Fox do, it is
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.120]  very, very clearly incitement of violence.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.420]  Yes, incitement of violence is a federal felony.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.760]  And how do we regulate for people who are committing felonies?
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.080]  We arrest them and put them in jail.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.080]  Arrest Tucker Carlson.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.360]  Yesterday, we heard from a whistleblower within the U.S. government who reached out to warn
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.920]  us that the NSA, the National Security Agency, is monitoring our electronic communications
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.320]  and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take the show off the air.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.400]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]  at you.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.840]  Is any news organization you know of so corrupt that it's willing to hurt you on behalf of
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.680]  its biggest advertisers?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.800]  The other channels took hundreds of millions of dollars from big pharma companies, and
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.960]  then they shilled for their sketchy products on the air.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.320]  And as they did that, they maligned anyone who was skeptical of those products.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.320]  We'll be back.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.160]  By the way, the entire episode of Let Them Eat Bugs, not quite as good as pizza, streaming
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160]  now on Fox station.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.480]  Use a promo code Originals for 30 days free.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.160]  And we'll be back on Monday.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.200]  In the meantime, have the best weekend with the ones that you love.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.920]  And we'll see you then.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.560]  Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have mutually agreed to part ways.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.240]  Tucker's last show was this past Friday.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240]  What?
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.680]  Get out of here.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.320]  Tucker Carlson's going to leave Fox News?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320]  Yep.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.640]  Tucker was the mainstay of the populist voiceover at Fox, and it's just, this is blockbuster
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.640]  news.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640]  Which means he was fired.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.640]  I mean, that's really what parting ways means.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:05:00.800]  The day was already good enough with the Knicks being up three to one, and now this.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.600]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.760]  We made it even stronger.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.360]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, Turbo Force is back in stock
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.440]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.960]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours, should be
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.580]  called 10 hour energy.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.040]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.920]  that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.920]  name it.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.600]  It is the super fuel.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.920]  Rain Force Plus is great, Rain Force Ultra is great, they're two different nootropics,
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.920]  they go good with this, but this is the king kong.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.360]  This is the boss.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.200]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.920]  It's Thursday, April 27th, 2023, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:36.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, what a time to be alive right now.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.920]  Welcome to this live Thursday, April 27th broadcast.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.920]  We have some huge guests in studio and more today.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.920]  I'll tell you a little bit about coming up at the bottom of the hour, but first, Tucker
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:07:01.920]  Carlson on Twitter last night released a two minute, 17 second clip and he knocks it
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.920]  completely out of the park.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.920]  It has upwards of 60 million views so far on Twitter.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.920]  It's been shared across the internet to an innumerable amount of people and it shows
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.920]  the paper tiger that is the mouthpiece corporate media.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.920]  Make no mistake, the firing of Tucker Carlson heralds the complete final nail in the coffin
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.920]  of establishment cable TV.
[00:07:32.923 --> 00:07:39.923]  And the Deep State's attempts to silence Tucker Carlson, myself, and many others
[00:07:39.923 --> 00:07:44.923]  are failing because of you, the steadfast listeners and viewers that understand the key.
[00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:52.610]  Not just this nation, but almost every country in the world is under the corporate dictatorship of the globalists.
[00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:59.610]  And as the world awakens that there is a uniparty system worldwide doing this, it's game over for them.
[00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.610]  And Tucker Carlson understands that explicitly.
[00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:11.039]  And yes, the leftist media has pointed this out. And yes, it's true.
[00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:18.999]  Was this broadcast first woke Carlson up 13 years ago?
[00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.999]  He told me that when he traveled here to meet me.
[00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:28.999]  And then in the process, he positioned himself for what you're now witnessing happening, and they took the bait.
[00:08:29.674 --> 00:08:36.914]  And it has blown up in their face, catapulting him from the number one populous talk show
[00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:40.274]  host on cable to now being super iconic.
[00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:48.822]  And it is absolutely turn the tables on them and they'll have no way other than killing him
[00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:56.741]  They're stopping and you can bet your bottom dollar that within six months or
[00:08:56.741 --> 00:09:01.560]  so probably sooner he's taking some time off you're gonna see Tucker Carlson
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:08.601]  come back stronger than ever and that's what all the leftists on the
[00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:14.720]  view and the young turds on YouTube and all the CNN minions and all the
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.361]  gremlins over at MSNBC and all the all the trolls over at CBS all the jokes
[00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:23.560]  over at the Huffington Post
[00:09:21.974 --> 00:09:32.254]  Don't understand that while they're celebrating his crucifixion, they have
[00:09:32.254 --> 00:09:36.934]  absolutely fallen into our trap. And if you think their persecution of Alex
[00:09:36.934 --> 00:09:43.694]  Jones hurt them, which it did previously, it is absolutely blowing up in their
[00:09:43.694 --> 00:09:48.734]  face. Yeah, they're indicting Trump. Yeah, they're firing Carlson. Yeah, they're
[00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:52.014]  trying to destroy Jones. Yeah, they're going after all of us. But we know who
[00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:56.614]  they are. We know they're a fraud, and we know they're giving us no quarter. And
[00:09:56.614 --> 00:10:02.534]  every metric shows the worm has turned. The point of no return for their
[00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:07.654]  collapse is now here. Now again, this is a short clip. First thing he's put out
[00:10:07.654 --> 00:10:14.254]  since Friday being fired. And conservatively, hundreds of millions of
[00:10:14.254 --> 00:10:18.054]  people have watched this, and it only went up last night at 8 o'clock Eastern
[00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:24.974]  when he normally would start a show. And so what you'll be seeing is on a routine
[00:10:24.974 --> 00:10:27.494]  basis...
[00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:32.954]  Monologues from Tucker Carlson, and isn't it funny, this one's obviously shot on an
[00:10:32.954 --> 00:10:37.873]  iPhone. You can see it's not even a television camera. Doesn't have the big
[00:10:37.873 --> 00:10:43.513]  giant, fancy studio, though he's got that. Multiple ones he owns. Funny how he's just
[00:10:43.513 --> 00:10:53.814]  been getting positioned for this. Anyways, oh, and such a shock. He was gonna get
[00:10:53.814 --> 00:10:57.853]  fired. That's why I told you on March 8th he'd probably be gone in the next few
[00:10:57.853 --> 00:11:03.774]  months. Hmm. So I just want our enemies to know that you play one-dimensional
[00:11:03.774 --> 00:11:07.654]  checkers. You don't play chess. You don't play two-dimensional, three-dimensional,
[00:11:07.654 --> 00:11:14.654]  four-dimensional. A non-two-dimensional thinker would see this immediately. Any
[00:11:14.654 --> 00:11:18.534]  student of Hegelian dialectic would understand it. But the left is so
[00:11:18.534 --> 00:11:22.894]  degenerate, so wacko, they've only inherited the world their grandparents
[00:11:22.934 --> 00:11:28.093]  stole with fractional reserve banking in their system. They've inherited unlimited
[00:11:28.093 --> 00:11:32.454]  money and all this power and all this control, and their main focus is stamping
[00:11:32.454 --> 00:11:36.694]  out manhood, stamping out the family, destroying the middle class, and
[00:11:36.694 --> 00:11:40.853]  dominating America, the source of their power, while they destroy the American
[00:11:40.853 --> 00:11:47.574]  spirit that they harnessed that was the source of their power. So it's quite the
[00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:51.894]  moment, ladies and gentlemen. And Tucker, in this clip, it's posted up at
[00:11:51.894 --> 00:12:00.013]  InfoWars.com. I hope you share it. In just two minutes and 17 seconds, lays
[00:12:00.013 --> 00:12:04.973]  beautifully out what we're facing. A uniparty that's hijacked the country,
[00:12:04.973 --> 00:12:10.493]  that's surveilling and censoring and persecuting and attacking the people to
[00:12:10.493 --> 00:12:13.934]  drive us into submission. They did years of lockdowns and attempted forced
[00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:19.493]  injections, and everything they're doing is a plan to destroy us. And now all the
[00:12:19.493 --> 00:12:24.534]  major populist and conservative political cartoons are saying that. And
[00:12:24.534 --> 00:12:31.134]  all the free thinkers are seeing and saying Alex Jones was right. They're out
[00:12:31.134 --> 00:12:38.894]  to get us. They're the new world order. So it's been said different ways in many
[00:12:38.894 --> 00:12:42.574]  ways, but it comes down to this.
[00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:47.242]  You think we're in here with you?
[00:12:47.242 --> 00:12:50.402]  You're in here with us.
[00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:53.502]  And we've done a great job not taking your race war bait.
[00:12:53.502 --> 00:12:57.882]  We've done a great job not being violent and being Christ-like at this point to let everybody
[00:12:57.882 --> 00:13:02.442]  see who you are, to draw you out and let you run around and freak out and scream and yell
[00:13:02.442 --> 00:13:08.842]  and panic and piss on us and dominate us and bully us while everybody's watching.
[00:13:09.842 --> 00:13:13.722]  So, yeah, you'll be able to hijack some minds and destroy some people.
[00:13:13.722 --> 00:13:17.922]  But every day that passes, the new world order is weaker and humanity stronger.
[00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.202]  Here's part of what Tucker Carlson had to say last night.
[00:13:20.202 --> 00:13:21.482]  Good evening.
[00:13:21.482 --> 00:13:22.482]  It's Tucker Carlson.
[00:13:22.482 --> 00:13:27.202]  One of the first things you realize when you step outside the noise for a few days is how
[00:13:27.202 --> 00:13:30.522]  many genuinely nice people there are in this country.
[00:13:30.522 --> 00:13:34.122]  Kind and decent people, people who really care about what's true.
[00:13:34.122 --> 00:13:36.722]  And a bunch of hilarious people.
[00:13:36.722 --> 00:13:37.722]  Also a lot of those.
[00:13:38.082 --> 00:13:40.922]  It's got to be the majority of the population, even now.
[00:13:40.922 --> 00:13:42.322]  So that's heartening.
[00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:47.162]  The other thing you notice when you take a little time off is how unbelievably stupid
[00:13:47.162 --> 00:13:50.082]  most of the debates you see on television are.
[00:13:50.082 --> 00:13:51.602]  They're completely irrelevant.
[00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:53.002]  They mean nothing.
[00:13:53.002 --> 00:13:55.842]  In five years, we won't even remember that we had them.
[00:13:55.842 --> 00:13:58.482]  Trust me as someone who's participated.
[00:13:58.482 --> 00:14:03.482]  And yet at the same time, and this is the amazing thing, the undeniably big topics,
[00:14:03.482 --> 00:14:08.082]  the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all.
[00:14:08.082 --> 00:14:15.922]  War, civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, natural resources.
[00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:20.282]  When was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues?
[00:14:20.282 --> 00:14:22.122]  It's been a long time.
[00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:25.482]  Debates like that are not permitted in American media.
[00:14:25.482 --> 00:14:31.122]  Both political parties and their donors have reached consensus on what benefits them.
[00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:34.922]  And they actively collude to shut down any conversation about it.
[00:14:34.922 --> 00:14:39.802]  Suddenly, the United States looks very much like a one party state.
[00:14:39.802 --> 00:14:43.282]  That's a depressing realization, but it's not permanent.
[00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:46.282]  Our current orthodoxies won't last.
[00:14:46.282 --> 00:14:47.602]  They're brain dead.
[00:14:47.602 --> 00:14:49.802]  Nobody actually believes them.
[00:14:49.802 --> 00:14:52.922]  Hardly anyone's life is improved by them.
[00:14:52.922 --> 00:14:56.202]  This moment is too inherently ridiculous to continue.
[00:14:56.202 --> 00:14:57.882]  And so it won't.
[00:14:57.882 --> 00:14:59.202]  The people in charge know this.
[00:14:59.202 --> 00:15:01.402]  That's why they're hysterical and aggressive.
[00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:02.402]  They're afraid.
[00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.242]  They've given up persuasion.
[00:15:04.242 --> 00:15:06.362]  They're resorting to force.
[00:15:06.362 --> 00:15:07.802]  But it won't work.
[00:15:07.802 --> 00:15:14.362]  When honest people say what's true calmly and without embarrassment, they become powerful.
[00:15:14.362 --> 00:15:20.242]  At the same time, the liars who've been trying to silence them shrink and they become weaker.
[00:15:20.242 --> 00:15:22.042]  That's the iron law of the universe.
[00:15:22.042 --> 00:15:24.442]  True things prevail.
[00:15:24.442 --> 00:15:26.842]  Where can you still find Americans saying true things?
[00:15:27.482 --> 00:15:30.202]  There aren't many places left, but there are some.
[00:15:30.202 --> 00:15:31.202]  And that's enough.
[00:15:31.202 --> 00:15:34.882]  As long as you can hear the words, there is hope.
[00:15:34.882 --> 00:15:36.882]  See you soon.
[00:15:36.882 --> 00:15:39.322]  It's over 60 million views on Twitter now.
[00:15:39.322 --> 00:15:40.322]  Hundreds of millions of views.
[00:15:40.322 --> 00:15:42.642]  His show on average had about 4 million viewers.
[00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:44.522]  Now it's 100 million.
[00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:46.002]  See how it works?
[00:15:46.002 --> 00:15:47.562]  You'll never stop us.
[00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:48.562]  Never.
[00:15:48.562 --> 00:15:50.202]  Not as long as the people stand with us.
[00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:51.562]  Listeners, take action.
[00:15:51.562 --> 00:15:52.562]  Share the live links.
[00:15:52.562 --> 00:15:53.562]  It's live.
[00:15:53.562 --> 00:15:54.562]  Live.
[00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:55.562]  Live.
[00:15:55.562 --> 00:15:56.562]  Live.
[00:15:56.562 --> 00:15:57.562]  Live.
[00:15:58.929 --> 00:16:05.929]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:16:05.929 --> 00:16:07.929]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:09.929]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:16:09.929 --> 00:16:12.929]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:15.929]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:16:15.929 --> 00:16:17.929]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[00:16:17.929 --> 00:16:24.929]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:27.929]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:16:27.929 --> 00:16:30.929]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:34.929]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:38.929]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:16:38.929 --> 00:16:41.929]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:44.929]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:45.929]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:48.929]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[00:16:48.929 --> 00:16:51.929]  while getting great products at the same time at infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:52.929]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:56.929]  Go to infowarsstore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air,
[00:16:56.929 --> 00:16:58.929]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:13.929]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements
[00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:16.929]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:18.929]  So support Infowars Store.
[00:17:18.929 --> 00:17:23.929]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know, I don't know.
[00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:26.929]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:31.929]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[00:17:31.929 --> 00:17:32.929]  Krill oil.
[00:17:32.929 --> 00:17:38.929]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[00:17:38.929 --> 00:17:40.929]  that will keep you alive.
[00:17:40.929 --> 00:17:43.929]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins,
[00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:46.929]  maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[00:17:46.929 --> 00:17:49.929]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:51.929]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[00:17:51.929 --> 00:17:53.929]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:17:53.929 --> 00:17:56.929]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:17:56.929 --> 00:17:59.929]  You have to have these products.
[00:17:59.929 --> 00:18:03.929]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:18:07.929 --> 00:18:10.929]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:10.929 --> 00:18:14.929]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:17.929]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:21.929]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:18:21.929 --> 00:18:23.929]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:23.929 --> 00:18:27.929]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:31.929]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:35.929]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:38.929]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:41.929]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:18:41.929 --> 00:18:44.929]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:18:44.929 --> 00:18:47.929]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:49.929]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:52.929]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:15.929]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[00:19:41.929 --> 00:19:43.929]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[00:19:43.929 --> 00:19:47.929]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action now
[00:19:47.929 --> 00:19:51.929]  and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's counting the great reset
[00:19:51.929 --> 00:19:56.929]  by going to Infowarsstore.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:59.929]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:06.929]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:19.370]  Mahatma Gandhi, before he peacefully overthrew the British Empire in India, said something very important.
[00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:27.370]  First, your enemies ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they attack you. Then you win.
[00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:35.370]  We have entered the final phase. And as long as those of us at the tip of the spear are willing to take the punishment,
[00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:44.370]  our women and our children and our society will go through the gap behind us, and we will secure the future.
[00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:51.370]  That's what this is all about, boys and girls.
[00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.370]  And I don't just give you good news to give you good news to make you feel good.
[00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.370]  We have positioned the enemy for their destruction.
[00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:09.370]  The volcanic eruption of freedom and the desire for free will has successfully been triggered.
[00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:17.370]  The dominoes are falling, but some of us must first go to the fire and come out stronger on the other side.
[00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:28.370]  You can't win, sir. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:37.370]  You should not have come back.
[00:21:37.370 --> 00:22:02.370]  You should not have come back.
[00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:13.370]  And here's the move.
[00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:30.370]  Ben?
[00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.370]  They took the bait.
[00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.370]  We withstood the pain.
[00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:50.370]  Now, the beginning of the end of the New World Order has begun.
[00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:54.370]  We're far from ending this war, but we've turned the tide.
[00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:00.370]  But you should take a few minutes to savor the fact the number one story in the world is Tucker Carlson being fired,
[00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:06.370]  and it's only getting bigger as everyone rediscovers everything he said.
[00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.370]  I've already been through this process myself.
[00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:16.370]  A humble little detonator that was attached to the larger explosive stockpile.
[00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:24.370]  And now, politically, nonviolently, a major explosion and chain reaction has begun.
[00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:34.370]  And all the king's horses and all the New World Order's men can't put their satanic pedophile network back together again.
[00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:42.370]  So let the pain and the persecution and the bullying we're going to go through come as sweet victory.
[00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:47.370]  Because just like when the police began to split the heads of black Americans demanding the right to civil rights
[00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:51.370]  and release the police dogs and the fire hoses on them, they had won.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:57.340]  And all of us now have to go through that in a high-tech fashion
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.340]  and hold the line that the enemy will commit terror attacks.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.340]  They will blame it on us, but no one's going to buy it.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.340]  And we're going to have to go through this process.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.340]  And some of us will have to be killed.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.340]  Some of us will have to be in prison.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.340]  Some of us will have to be tortured.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.340]  But that's what men are supposed to go through.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.340]  That's what it's all about.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.340]  You weren't put here to just sit around and watch Netflix and eat chili dogs.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.340]  Well, that sounds good.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.340]  And drink beer.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.340]  We were here for this test right now.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.340]  And I am just superlatively blessed to be associated with this crew
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.340]  and this audience of activists and patriots.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:41.340]  And I am so blessed to be associated with the radicalization of Tucker Carlson.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.340]  This is such an important thing.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.340]  Much more important than if you were a...
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:55.100]  National Baseball League scout, and you went out and found the next Babe Ruth.
[00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.190]  Because this is for all the marbles.
[00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.190]  This is about life and death and transcendence.
[00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.190]  This is about everything, and the criminal, out-of-control globalists
[00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.190]  that have sold America out, and they now want to dumb us down further
[00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.190]  to secure their victory of tyranny.
[00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:21.449]  The fact that they're being spotlighted like cockroaches when you flip the light on at midnight
[00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:31.290]  is beautiful and it's here. So here's a meme for radio listeners. I'll describe it shows a Fox
[00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:36.570]  News individual behind a desk at a convention center. No one's lined up at the Fox News desk.
[00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:43.850]  Everyone is lined up at the Tucker Carlson desk which is the anti-new world order anti-globalist
[00:25:44.889 --> 00:25:48.889]  pro-human populist desk. And now Elon Musk is lined up at that desk
[00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:55.610]  because we're all Alex Jones now. It's not that Alex Jones was right and right again and is right
[00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:01.050]  it's that we were all right. I was just a prominent person that believed in humanity
[00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:06.169]  and bet on you and believed that if we persevered and went through hell and didn't take the payoffs
[00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:11.209]  and didn't back down to the threats that we could beat these people and we are beating them right now.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:21.440]  And if we just have the eye of the tiger and stay focused and pray to God and humble ourselves and speak out and have courage,
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:27.440]  in a focused, calm way, as Tucker Carlson said, I'm not always that way, but the way he does it is the best.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:39.440]  He's a great role model for us all. We will win. Our culture will win, our children will win, our progeny will win, our future will succeed.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:48.440]  The enemy wants the future. And to do it, they've poisoned us with every vile cultural degeneracy you can imagine.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:56.440]  But in the final equation, people have a hunger for freedom. And when good men and women stand up, there's no tyrant on earth that can stand against us.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:03.440]  All right. Again, this is bigger than Tucker Carlson. It's bigger than any one of us. It's a Rosetta Stone.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.440]  It is a skeleton key, as I say, that opens every door. Through this story, you can see every angle of it.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.440]  I mean, each piece of this is so incredible. I'll hit next segment.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.440]  Look at this one. And I already knew the inside baseball on this. I'll leave it at that.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:26.440]  Wait. But I waited till this came out. The ex-Tucker Carlson producer who's suing him at Fox has never met him.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:33.820]  I'll tell you all about that.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.740]  This Fox News primetime ratings plummet after Tucker Carlson's firing and Newsmax sees boost.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:46.940]  And Tucker Carlson has over 60 million views on the Twitter video alone.
[00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:52.450]  How'd that work out for you?
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:28:07.040]  Tucker Carlson's had more viewers in a two-minute, 17-second video than Fox News has had all week.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040]  And it will continue.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.760]  Oh, and if you kill him, I'm sad for him and his family.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.520]  But Tucker's committed to whatever happens and says, I don't care.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.640]  I'm not stopping, ever, ever.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.840]  He's looked right into my eyes.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.840]  Late last year.
[00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:33.770]  And said, I've never been so alive.
[00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.610]  I love this so much, man, he's going to win.
[00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:37.610]  We're never going to stop.
[00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.490]  And I'm not going to tell you the rest of that long, in-depth meeting.
[00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:49.170]  But the point is, if you think Tucker Carlson didn't see this coming, I got a bridge I want
[00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.170]  to sell you.
[00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:56.970]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we have the path to victory.
[00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.370]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.889 --> 00:29:04.970]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.129]  We made it even stronger.
[00:29:07.129 --> 00:29:12.690]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, TurboForce is back in stock
[00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.770]  at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:24.290]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours, should be
[00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.930]  called 10-hour energy.
[00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:31.370]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:36.530]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.530]  it.
[00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.330]  It is the super fuel.
[00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:42.770]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:43.770]  RainForce Alt is great.
[00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:44.770]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.770]  They go good with this.
[00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.290]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.889]  This is the boss.
[00:29:49.889 --> 00:29:53.690]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:57.370]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.690]  on the front.
[00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.810]  They're in a mugshot jail background.
[00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:29.810]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:33.970]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:35.250]  We also have Alex Yost for president.
[00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.610]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.810]  It's a really nice navy blue, high-quality shirt, red, white, and blue.
[00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.770]  Alex Yost for president, 2024.
[00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:46.210]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt, great way to fund the operation.
[00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:54.850]  So get your Alex Yost for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling
[00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.850]  toll-free, AAA, 253-3139.
[00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.850]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.850]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.850]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:14.850]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.490]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:22.490]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in
[00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:27.490]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.490]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:37.490]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.490]  I know you spread the word.
[00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.490]  I know you pray for us.
[00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.490]  And that's wonderful.
[00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:41.490]  Keep doing it.
[00:31:42.129 --> 00:31:46.129]  Viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsTore.com and you never buy great products that enrich
[00:31:46.129 --> 00:31:49.129]  and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:31:49.129 --> 00:31:53.129]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:53.129 --> 00:31:58.129]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:31:58.129 --> 00:31:59.129]  Please take action now.
[00:31:59.129 --> 00:32:03.129]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:32:08.129 --> 00:32:09.129]  I want you all to know something.
[00:32:09.129 --> 00:32:11.129]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.770]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.770]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.770]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.770]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.770]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.770]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:33.770]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.770]  Years ago.
[00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.770]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.770]  Not for a second.
[00:32:40.409 --> 00:32:42.409]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:44.409]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:32:44.409 --> 00:32:47.409]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:32:47.409 --> 00:32:49.409]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[00:32:49.409 --> 00:32:52.409]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:07.950]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:29.290]  Rising up, straight to the top, every gut's got the glory, what's the distance now, I'm
[00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:37.290]  not gonna stop, trust the man and his will to survive, it's the allegory, the analogy
[00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:47.290]  of Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, is very instructive, but here's one that's even more instructive,
[00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.290]  V for Vendetta.
[00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.290]  So do you know what's gonna happen?
[00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.290]  No.
[00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.290]  It was a feeling.
[00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:03.290]  But I can guess.
[00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:11.290]  There's so much chaos, someone will do something stupid.
[00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:29.290]  And when they do, things will turn nasty.
[00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:38.290]  And then, Suttler will be forced to do the only thing he knows how to do.
[00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:45.290]  At which point, all V needs to do is keep his word.
[00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.290]  And then...
[00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:52.490]  A voice of unity, a voice of peace, a voice of justice, a voice of populism and prosperity
[00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:57.330]  and security, calling that a racist terrorist, a violent seeker.
[00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.730]  We'll get to that more in a moment.
[00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:06.009]  Fox News primetime ratings plummet after Tucker Carlson firing Yahoo News.
[00:37:06.009 --> 00:37:10.410]  And this very interesting little tidbit...
[00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.569]  And I've already experienced this, and I'm not going to spend an hour telling you any
[00:37:13.569 --> 00:37:20.850]  of the stories, but wait, the ex-Tucker Carlson producer who's suing him and Fox never met
[00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:21.850]  him.
[00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:30.450]  You see, Tucker, what was it, four or five years ago, left D.C. and moved to Boca Grande
[00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:34.609]  on the west coast of Florida, about an hour and a half south of Tampa.
[00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:40.730]  And one of the reasons he did that was they were trying to set him up, like they've done
[00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:45.930]  so many people, with the staff members, with the interns, with the executives, with the
[00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:46.930]  people.
[00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:51.730]  And it's not just Tucker, but many of these high-profile people have to have an assistant
[00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.730]  with them at all times.
[00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:59.529]  You can never be in a room alone in these larger facilities because they send these people
[00:37:59.529 --> 00:38:00.529]  in.
[00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:01.770]  Oh, I'm not saying they sent her in.
[00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:07.129]  She reportedly has 90-plus recordings and has people making jokes and things about the
[00:38:07.129 --> 00:38:11.129]  left, and is suing and saying it was all anti-Semitic.
[00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:23.950]  While the ADL calls for Tucker to be removed, they've had national newspapers, we're not
[00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:28.270]  going to put them on screen, I don't give it any attention, on record pay people that
[00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.830]  have worked here.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:36.060]  To say things that are 100% manufactured, not true.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.060]  And then I talked to crew members after these people had left and then gone and done this,
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.060]  at least three of them, and they said it was so strange.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.060]  They'd walk in the break room and start saying the N-word and trying to get us to say it.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:51.060]  We'd say, stop that. We even told the person not to say it.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.060]  They were black.
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:58.060]  And then one of the other people involved in this on road trips,
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.060]  the crew members came back and when I found out about it, the person, quote, quit,
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:07.060]  would say, you know, I'm so sick of these black people and would start talking about the N-words.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:12.060]  And multiple crew members would say, I like everybody. I'm a Christian.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.060]  I don't agree with that. You need to stop that.
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.060]  And obviously we know what was going on.
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.060]  We were being recorded, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.430]  And I even learned the details of the law firms, the people that were involved.
[00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:26.430]  This is intelligence agency level stuff.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:39.440]  Now Tucker Carlson's alone in rooms with me, and we've had our meetings, because he knows
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.080]  I'm not going to lie about him or make stuff up, but he can't be in the room with almost
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.720]  anybody alone, because he knows this.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.800]  He gets out of his car, he goes into the studio with a trusted crew, and he's still never
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.080]  in a room alone with any of them.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.759]  Think about living like that.
[00:39:55.759 --> 00:40:00.759]  That's what you've got to do to have victory in this, and I tell you those stories to understand
[00:40:00.759 --> 00:40:06.759]  how high the stakes are and how incredibly serious these people are.
[00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:17.270]  But by the grace of God, Tucker has kept his nose clean and so have I, and they've never
[00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:21.589]  been able to set us up, but they have tried long and they have tried hard.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:30.620]  But you're going to hear about this Abby Grossberg all day long that didn't even work in the
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.280]  same state with Carlson.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.520]  And never met him.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:41.400]  Never met him.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:51.460]  On a mission.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.080]  In my view of deception.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.080]  So, Fox News.
[00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:07.370]  Has about 15 million independent different viewers a day.
[00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.370]  Tucker was actually way higher than that.
[00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.370]  They just gave low-ball numbers.
[00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.370]  It was so embarrassing the rest of cable news.
[00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:23.390]  And now his first video, conservatively, has hundreds of millions of views, 67 million
[00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:24.390]  on Twitter alone.
[00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:29.350]  What does that say about them and their whole system and everything they've set up and
[00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.350]  what they've done?
[00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:36.149]  And I know like Alex Jones, Peter Carlson's really never made any mistakes, but he's been
[00:41:36.149 --> 00:41:38.189]  able to learn from mine, and has.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.700]  And so, again, what does that say about this power structure?
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.700]  They have a company making tens of billions of dollars a year,
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.700]  and paying a talk show host $20 million a year and didn't even care about the money,
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.700]  took a major pay cut to, quote, have control of the show,
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.700]  and their billions and billions of dollars in all of it
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:02.700]  can't get one-tenth the viewers he has now that he's left them.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.700]  But if it wasn't the fact that Elon Musk had taken over Twitter,
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.700]  you better believe they would have removed him Friday from Twitter
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.700]  when he was fired to fully silence him.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.700]  But because he has that one platform,
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.700]  it makes all the others look ridiculous that they're taking down,
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.700]  so they can't do it.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.700]  And we have a wedge into the enemy operation,
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.700]  and from that beachhead, they'll be destroyed.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.700]  And not just what Tucker Carlson, but the idea and the understanding of this,
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.700]  of how weak and what a paper tiger the enemy is.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:40.700]  I want to get more into this psyops expert.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.700]  When we come back, ex-U.S. Army psyops expert.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.700]  Fox News fired Carlson to maintain, quote,
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.700]  semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.700]  I wouldn't call them semi-lobotomized, retarded.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.700]  I would say what they are, in a trance, in a daydream, under a spell.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.700]  And we're breaking that spell now.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.700]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.700]  that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.700]  and take him off the air.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.700]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful, it never happened.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.700]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.700]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.700]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.700]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:22.700]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros,
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.700]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.700]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.700]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.700]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.700]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.700]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.700]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.700]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.700]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.700]  while getting great products at the same time at infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.700]  So don't procrastinate, go to infowarsstore.com,
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.700]  get amazing products that keep us on the air,
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.700]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:04.700]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.700]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.700]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.700]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.700]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.700]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.700]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.700]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.700]  It's as if there were a plan in place.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.700]  It just can't happen.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.700]  We need to go into the capital.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.700]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.700]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.700]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.700]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.700]  You silenced those voices.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.700]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.700]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.700]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:04.700]  The Great Reset
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.700]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.700]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.700]  It is.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.700]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.700]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.700]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.700]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.700]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.700]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.700]  Krill oil is the best.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.700]  And it will give you the damn burps.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.700]  And I'm sorry.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.700]  If you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.700]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:31.700]  It's so good in my view.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.700]  I'm not making a medical statement here.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.700]  But let me tell you something.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.700]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.700]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:44.700]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.700]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.700]  But you notice I just obsess.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.700]  Because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.700]  I just can't do it.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:55.700]  InfoWars4.com
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.700]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.700]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.700]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.700]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes,
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.700]  the researchers, the writers,
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.700]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.700]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.700]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.700]  five, six, seven days a week,
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.700]  it's really just incredible.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.700]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew,
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.700]  I thank you for your past support.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.700]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.700]  InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:38.700]  I know you spread the word.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.700]  I know you pray for us.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.700]  And that's wonderful.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:41.700]  Keep doing it.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.700]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWars4.com
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.700]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.700]  all at the same time keep us on air.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.700]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.700]  go buy products at InfoWars4.com.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.700]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars4.com,
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.700]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.700]  Please take action now.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.700]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:34.930]  Lord, I can't change, I'm not going to roll over because I'm going to fly, tree bird, baby.
[00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:40.089]  America is discovering the coup, America is discovering the enemy, the chain reaction
[00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:44.689]  has begun, and it is beautiful.
[00:47:44.689 --> 00:47:49.850]  Today in studio, next hour, Brian Rose of London Real, great thinker, can't wait to
[00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:50.850]  have him here.
[00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:54.009]  He's an American, but he's really kicked ass over in Europe.
[00:47:54.009 --> 00:47:59.490]  Luke Rutkowski, one of my old friends going back 18 years, to be joining us to cover the
[00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:00.490]  waterfront as well.
[00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.450]  The amazing Drew Hernandez, our number four today.
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.780]  So, let's talk about the reality.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.780]  They got rid of Tucker Carlson.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.780]  The most astute thing I've heard about this was because of what he might say in the future.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.780]  They were already upset about everything else he said in the past,
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:24.780]  and the fact that he was convincing the intelligentsia and the establishment to go against the new world order,
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:29.780]  and the fact that he was working with major whistleblowers at the highest levels of the Border Patrol
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:38.780]  of confirming massive child kidnapping rings worldwide, being run by the people that control Joe Biden.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:39.780]  I told you about that Monday.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.780]  It broke yesterday.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.780]  So, it's all coming out.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.780]  They can't stop any of it.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:52.780]  They're in full panic mode, and the deep state said, you've got to get rid of Carlson.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.780]  But now, how do they feel with him even bigger?
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.780]  And I would advise Carlson to keep doing monologues every night at eight.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.780]  I told you, look for that.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.780]  That would be the first thing he'd do, and to launch his own system.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:10.780]  So, he totally controls it, and I predict you'll see that the latest by January of next year.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:18.780]  So, within six, seven months, eight months, I predict you will see that.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.780]  You heard it here first.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:25.780]  Just like I told you in March of last year, excuse me, of this year, a month and a half ago,
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.780]  that I believe he'll be fired from FOX in the next few months.
[00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:36.690]  That was an easy call.
[00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:37.690]  Yeah, good riddance.
[00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:41.690]  Pentagon officials cheer Tucker Carlson's ouster.
[00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.690]  Here's the story.
[00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.690]  Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com today.
[00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.690]  Suggest you read it and share it.
[00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:50.690]  Ex-U.S. Army PSYOPs expert, FOX News,
[00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:52.690]  fired Carlson to maintain, quote,
[00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.690]  semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.690]  No, they're actually just in a trance.
[00:49:57.690 --> 00:49:59.690]  A former U.S. Army psychological warfare officer
[00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.690]  says that Tucker Carlson was fired by FOX News
[00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.690]  because of the regime's agenda to maintain
[00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.690]  a uniform, semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:11.690]  The remarks were made by U.S. counterterrorism expert Scott Bennett.
[00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:13.690]  Carlson said FOX News parted ways on Monday
[00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.690]  with the speculation still raging
[00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:17.690]  as to the specific reason why the network
[00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:20.690]  scanned its highest-rated, most popular host.
[00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:23.690]  Well, he was the reason that it was so popular
[00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:24.690]  and it was waking people up.
[00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:25.690]  That's why.
[00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:28.690]  According to Bennett, Carlson posed too much of a threat
[00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:31.690]  to the institutional power because he turned Americans
[00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:33.690]  into proper researchers and thinkers.
[00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:36.690]  Yes, that's it, what he would do in the future,
[00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:38.690]  what he would inspire.
[00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:40.690]  Carlson offered an intellectualism, truthfulness,
[00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:43.690]  and an analytical depth that no other news personality
[00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:44.690]  has ever done in the history of the United States
[00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:47.690]  as far back as I can remember, said Bennett.
[00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.690]  Tucker needed to be silenced because he represented
[00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.690]  too big a threat to the powers and principalities,
[00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:56.690]  institutions, and agencies that seek to unenlighten,
[00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:59.690]  uninform, symbolize quasi-retarded population
[00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.690]  that do not question, do not research, do not analyze,
[00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.690]  but simply digest and follow instructions,
[00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.690]  according to Bennett.
[00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.690]  Tucker Carlson exposed the fraud and money laundering,
[00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.690]  racketeering crimes of FDX, the Democratic Party in Ukraine,
[00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:13.690]  involved in the United States government.
[00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:15.690]  He exposed the U.S. biological weapons labs in Ukraine
[00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:17.690]  and other connections to the Democratic Party.
[00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:19.690]  President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden,
[00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:20.690]  Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Bill Gates,
[00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:23.690]  and other U.S. government agencies and pharmaceutical companies.
[00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:25.690]  Bennett told the news.
[00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.690]  The ex-host's anti-regime rhetoric could no longer be tolerated
[00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.690]  by the corrupt American media and political establishment,
[00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:32.690]  said Bennett, adding that his exit signals
[00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.690]  the death of American media.
[00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:38.690]  The U.S. former Army PSY officer suggested that
[00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.690]  Senator Chuck Schumer had threatened to utilize the CIA and FBI
[00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:44.690]  to deploy secret government operations against Tucker
[00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:47.690]  to get him off the air unless he was fired.
[00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:48.690]  Oh, yeah.
[00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:50.690]  That was Strom Thurmond ordered.
[00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.690]  John Lennon murdered.
[00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:55.690]  Schumer previously called on Carlson to be taken off the air
[00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:58.690]  after a broadcast footage showing January 6th
[00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:00.690]  riot leaders were actually allowed in the Capitol
[00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.690]  and chaperoned around by authorities.
[00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.690]  It goes on.
[00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:05.690]  That's truth.
[00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:06.690]  That's dead on.
[00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.690]  That's important.
[00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:15.690]  And there's so many other facets to all of this.
[00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:17.690]  But the good news is...
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.520]  We're all Alex Jones now.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:29.520]  Whether you think Musk is an opportunist, good or bad, he knows which way the wind's blowing.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.520]  Tucker Carlson, I can tell you, is good. He knows where it's going. He's totally committed.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.520]  And many other people, not just the grassroots listeners of this show, people that have been fighting forever.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:46.520]  Yes, we're the first big wave that the tiny little patriot groups in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s helped generate.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:53.520]  That was the little wave, but the key wave, mainly of former intelligence operatives, FBI agents,
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.520]  and people that were on the inside and saw it. Great men, great women.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.520]  Congressional whistleblowers, Anthony Sutton, the list goes on and on.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.520]  That was the first wave, very small, but critical.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:07.520]  Just like you plant one tree, if you could live there for 200, 300 years,
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.520]  you'd see that that one oak tree drops acorns, more grow, more grow.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.520]  If they're not cut down, a whole forest grows from one oak tree.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.520]  So that first wave 50, 60 years ago was one oak.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:24.520]  Now it's a forest, and it's growing and growing and growing, and they can't stop it.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.520]  They can't defeat it.
[00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:36.549]  And so I was part of the second wave at the very beginning and crested in the
[00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:43.089]  last few years. But as my wave crashes it only pushes the next wave up and I'll be
[00:53:43.089 --> 00:53:46.569]  part of the next wave and so will you. It's not about who's most popular, it's
[00:53:46.569 --> 00:53:50.490]  not about who makes the most money, it's about who is effective at fighting the
[00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:56.529]  enemy. And I told you looking at Carlson, what he was doing, talking to him,
[00:53:56.529 --> 00:54:02.129]  working with him, that he was going to really be critical. And he knew that he
[00:54:02.129 --> 00:54:08.049]  wasn't backing down. He knew that he was pushing the envelope. He knew this was
[00:54:08.049 --> 00:54:16.649]  coming and he was already preparing. And that's why you see the photos out of
[00:54:16.649 --> 00:54:20.410]  Florida with he and his wife driving around on the golf cart having a great
[00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:25.410]  time. Because he's not part of the predators. He's not part of the devil
[00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:29.730]  worshippers. He's not part of the Satanists. He's not part of the
[00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.129]  pedophilia. He's not part of imploding the borders. He's not part of the fentanyl.
[00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:38.649]  He can sleep at night. He's honorable. He feels good and he sees victory in his
[00:54:38.649 --> 00:54:43.890]  lifetime. So you have to have that attitude of not caring what the enemy
[00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:46.690]  says about you and how they bully you and what they do and what they pull. The
[00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:52.450]  more they attack, you got to realize you are having an effect.
[00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:58.450]  And it's not going to fulfill you just to play golf and eat food and party.
[00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:01.450]  And there's certainly a place for that when you work for liberty and freedom.
[00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.450]  Work hard, play hard. But the work is freedom.
[00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.450]  It's not a debate with the left who's here to destroy us and enslave us
[00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:11.450]  and create their supremacist system of transhumanism.
[00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:17.450]  It's an honor to fight these people. It's a delicious delicacy.
[00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:24.450]  It is splendor. It is amazing. It is so good.
[00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:28.450]  And it's what we were all really born for, this choice we're making right now.
[00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.450]  All right, let me do this. We've got a break.
[00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:33.450]  Bring in our special guest. Cover all this other huge world news unfolding.
[00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:38.450]  Talk about the big picture. Look at the different details unfolding.
[00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:40.450]  But remember, I'm not funded by the globalists.
[00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:43.450]  I'm not funded by the New World Order. I don't have a war chest.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:51.640]  But I do have we the people and I've expended my energy and my focus to get the ball into the end zone with your help.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:58.640]  We've done it and now we have possession of the ball again and we're marching down towards the one yard line again.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.640]  But I need your prayers and I really mean that. Pray for me.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.640]  And pray for Awakening and pray for others and pray for Tucker and pray for Trump. He's not perfect.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:11.640]  And support the broadcast and spread the word and share the articles and share the videos.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.640]  Take clips out and put them on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and just keep hammering it.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.640]  Because I see our work everywhere in many ways bigger than it's ever been.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:27.640]  And I see God working through all of you and I commend you and salute you and ask you to realize you stand between all of us in the New World Order.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.640]  You're just as important as I am or Tucker or anybody else. And you know you're for real.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.640]  So share the articles, share the videos and don't procrastinate.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:41.640]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, get the prebiotic fighter, get Turbo Force Plus back in stock, get the ultimate krill oil.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:46.640]  A lot of that stuff sold out, the DNA Force and the turmeric toothpaste.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:52.640]  But we've got the Trump political prisoner shirt, the Alex Jones for President shirt, Real Red Pill selling out.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.640]  Amazing what it does for your body, your energy, your immune system, your youth.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:04.640]  It's 40% off Real Red Pill Plus. Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:12.640]  And finally, two great products, Infowars Platinum, private labels of the very best already top selling products in the country.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:22.640]  Natural high quality pain reduction with pain MD and 1776 testosterone boost that helps the natural testosterone in your body stay free in the body.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.640]  So it lasts longer, has a bigger effect and helps boost natural testosterone in other ways.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:34.640]  1776 testosterone boost at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:41.640]  But now is the battle and don't take Infowars for granted because the enemy is going after folks.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:46.640]  You heard that former intelligence high level operative saying they turned the CIA loose on Fox.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.640]  It wasn't just Tucker.
[00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:55.190]  Turboforce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turboforce Plus.
[00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.350]  We made it even stronger.
[00:57:57.350 --> 00:58:02.910]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, Turboforce is back in stock
[00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:07.990]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:14.430]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:16.150]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:21.610]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:26.750]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:27.750]  it.
[00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:31.550]  It is the super fuel.
[00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:32.990]  Rainforce Plus is great.
[00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.990]  Rainforce Alt is great.
[00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.990]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.990]  They go good with this.
[00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:38.510]  But this is the king kong.
[00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:40.190]  This is the boss.
[00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:43.910]  Turboforce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:49.950]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:56.230]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:57.350]  the atmosphere.
[00:58:57.350 --> 00:59:00.150]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:06.510]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:10.950]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:15.710]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:16.830]  dispose of it.
[00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:21.750]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who
[00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:25.270]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:31.790]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:34.190]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:39.430]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:45.870]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:48.430]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:57.430]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:07.430]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:09.430]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:13.430]  Good evening, it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:18.430]  One of the first things you realize when you step outside the noise for a few days is how
[01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:21.430]  many genuinely nice people there are in this country.
[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.430]  Kind and decent people.
[01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:25.430]  People who really care about what's true.
[01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:28.430]  And a bunch of hilarious people also.
[01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:29.430]  A lot of those.
[01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:31.430]  It's got to be the majority of the population, even now.
[01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:33.430]  So that's heartening.
[01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:38.430]  The other thing you notice when you take a little time off is how unbelievably stupid
[01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:41.430]  most of the debates you see on television are.
[01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.430]  They're completely irrelevant.
[01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.430]  They mean nothing.
[01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:47.430]  In five years, we won't even remember that we had them.
[01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:49.430]  Trust me as someone who's participated.
[01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:54.430]  And yet at the same time, and this is the amazing thing, the undeniably big topics,
[01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:59.430]  the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all.
[01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:00.430]  War.
[01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:01.430]  Civil liberties.
[01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:02.430]  Emerging science.
[01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:04.430]  Demographic change.
[01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:05.430]  Corporate power.
[01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:06.430]  Natural resources.
[01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:11.430]  When was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues?
[01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.430]  It's been a long time.
[01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:16.430]  Debates like that are not permitted in American media.
[01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:22.430]  Both political parties and their donors have reached consensus on what benefits them.
[01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:26.430]  And they actively collude to shut down any conversation about it.
[01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:30.430]  Suddenly, the United States looks very much like a one-party state.
[01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:32.430]  That's a depressing realization.
[01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:34.430]  But it's not permanent.
[01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:37.430]  Our current orthodoxies won't last.
[01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:38.430]  They're brain dead.
[01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:40.430]  Nobody actually believes them.
[01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:43.430]  Hardly anyone's life is improved by them.
[01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:47.430]  This moment is too inherently ridiculous to continue.
[01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:48.430]  And so it won't.
[01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.430]  The people in charge know this.
[01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:52.430]  That's why they're hysterical and aggressive.
[01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:53.430]  They're afraid.
[01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:55.430]  They've given up persuasion.
[01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:57.430]  And they're resorting to force.
[01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.430]  But it won't work.
[01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:03.430]  When honest people say what's true calmly and without embarrassment,
[01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:05.430]  they become powerful.
[01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:09.430]  At the same time, the liars who've been trying to silence them shrink.
[01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:11.430]  And they become weaker.
[01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.430]  That's the iron law of the universe.
[01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.430]  True things prevail.
[01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:18.430]  Where can you still find Americans saying true things?
[01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:21.430]  There aren't many places left, but there are some.
[01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:22.430]  And that's enough.
[01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:25.430]  As long as you can hear the words, there is hope.
[01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:27.430]  See you soon.
[01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:30.430]  What's so interesting about this is these are not MAGA people.
[01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:35.430]  These are the victims of systemic racism they're always lecturing us about, right?
[01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.430]  And their First Amendment rights have just been stripped,
[01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:41.430]  and they're looking at jail terms for having opinions Biden doesn't like.
[01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:42.430]  We're the liberals.
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:44.430]  Where's Morning Joe?
[01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:47.430]  We're all the sensitive white liberals to defend these people.
[01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.430]  They're not.
[01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:51.430]  Well, this is why I'm so glad you're covering this case, Tucker,
[01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:54.430]  because this is the tactic that tyrants always use.
[01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:57.430]  When they want to implement an authoritarian precedent,
[01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:59.430]  they choose people that makes others uncomfortable.
[01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:01.430]  When they wanted to start banning people from the Internet,
[01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:03.430]  they chose Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones
[01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:05.430]  because they knew that even Republicans would say,
[01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:07.430]  I don't want to defend those people.
[01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:08.430]  They're a bridge too far.
[01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:11.430]  And then the precedent gets set, and they expand it inward.
[01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.430]  Again, these are not people, the kind of black radicals,
[01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:17.430]  Democratic Party establishment representatives like.
[01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:19.430]  They're people who attack the Biden administration,
[01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:20.430]  who don't vote Democrat.
[01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.430]  These are real dissidents,
[01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:25.430]  and they know that not even Democrats will defend them.
[01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:28.430]  No, they're not taking money from Apple and Facebook.
[01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:30.430]  They weren't in on the BLM scam.
[01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:31.430]  They actually mean it.
[01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:33.430]  Now you're making me like them.
[01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:35.430]  Glenn Greenwald, I appreciate your coming on.
[01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:37.430]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block
[01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:41.430]  on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like,
[01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:43.430]  at least in government.
[01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:46.430]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor
[01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:49.430]  what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:51.430]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.430]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth,
[01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:58.430]  use companies to do it, the social media giants.
[01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:59.430]  And they are.
[01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.430]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become
[01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:04.430]  that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:06.430]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade
[01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:09.430]  against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:12.430]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party
[01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:14.430]  and multinational corporations and big tech
[01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.430]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:20.430]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day
[01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:23.430]  calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:26.430]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist,
[01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:30.430]  but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:32.430]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media
[01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:34.430]  for not defending the First Amendment,
[01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:37.430]  but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators
[01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:40.430]  to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:43.430]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:49.430]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:51.430]  In a free country, everyone can be hurt.
[01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:55.430]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be hurt.
[01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.430]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months,
[01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:05.430]  and it's TurboForce Plus.
[01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.430]  We made it even stronger.
[01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:11.430]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:18.430]  TurboForce is back in stock at infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:24.430]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.430]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:28.430]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals
[01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:31.430]  and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:35.430]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart,
[01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:38.430]  your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:40.430]  It is the super fuel.
[01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:43.430]  RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Alt is great.
[01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:45.430]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:47.430]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:49.430]  This is the boss.
[01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:54.430]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:57.430]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:20.430]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.430]  And we are now into our number two.
[01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.430]  And Brian Rose is a fellow American
[01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:38.430]  but launched his very popular TV show and programs out of London, England.
[01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:41.430]  He is with us in studio. He was here for the big blockchain event.
[01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:43.430]  It's been ongoing in Austin.
[01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:45.430]  Brian Rose is founder and host and CEO of London Real.
[01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:48.430]  He lived a successful business career as a banker in Wall Street,
[01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:50.430]  the city of London, to start London Real.
[01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:53.430]  His life from that point had delivered on the promises
[01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:56.430]  of his university education at MIT and his personal ambitions,
[01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:57.430]  but he felt empty.
[01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:00.430]  So he quit his job and started a podcast to share his journey.
[01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.430]  He fought resistance to turn London Real
[01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:05.430]  into a new generation media business with over half a billion views.
[01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.430]  More than that now, 2 million subscribers.
[01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:10.430]  Brian has conducted over 500 in-depth interviews
[01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:13.430]  and is an antidote to the numbing effects of the mainstream media.
[01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.430]  Brian also founded London Real Academy,
[01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:17.430]  offering live partnership, mentorship,
[01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:20.430]  and courses designed to help you transform yourself.
[01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:21.430]  LondonReal.tv.
[01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:24.430]  And I learned he was in Austin yesterday, so I asked him to come on the show.
[01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:28.430]  Perfect time to have him on for a big 35,000-foot view on the economy,
[01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:31.430]  Ukraine, the wars, the huge awakening that's happening.
[01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:33.430]  But obviously, first and foremost, thanks for being here.
[01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:36.430]  Let's get into Tucker Carlson.
[01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:39.430]  I mean, 60-something million views on Twitter,
[01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.430]  hundreds of millions of views, top story.
[01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:45.430]  Everything he said now magnified the entire anti-globalist agenda
[01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:47.430]  exploding everywhere, the deep state panicking.
[01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:51.430]  This is emblematic of them not thinking multi-moves ahead.
[01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:54.430]  What would it do if they fired Carlson?
[01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:56.430]  People keep asking why they fired him.
[01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:58.430]  The answer is the show, everything he did.
[01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:00.430]  And I've talked about the inside baseball,
[01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:03.430]  not giving away too much, but he had a contract that he got a third of the money
[01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:05.430]  he would have gotten if they controlled his show.
[01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:08.430]  So he took $20 million instead of $60 million to have control,
[01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:12.430]  but they kept taking control, and so that's why I said on March 8th,
[01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:14.430]  I think Tucker will be gone in a few months.
[01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:16.430]  Did he know it was coming at that time?
[01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:19.430]  No, but he expected it, and he's definitely been researching
[01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.430]  on how to launch his own operation.
[01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:24.430]  You saw him just on an iPhone last night, the top story,
[01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.430]  hundreds of millions of views.
[01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:30.430]  He's got to really be emblematic of the entire cable news system
[01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:34.430]  for three or four days won't have that many views.
[01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:39.430]  This has really got to illustrate that this is a facade.
[01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:41.430]  This is a paper tiger.
[01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:43.430]  So give us your take on that.
[01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.430]  Well, I think it's a beautiful thing, and it was only a matter of time
[01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:46.430]  before Tucker broke out.
[01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:49.430]  And like you said, he's going to be bigger than ever once he gets his own platform
[01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:51.430]  and then be a studio like yours here.
[01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:54.430]  And it just goes to show where this is all headed.
[01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.430]  Independent media is a beautiful thing.
[01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:59.430]  You encouraged me to set up my own platform three years ago
[01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:02.430]  because we were getting shut down by the big tech platforms.
[01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.430]  And you always said, Brian, once I got shut down from them,
[01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.430]  I became bigger than ever.
[01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:09.430]  And I think Tucker is going to be bigger than ever as well.
[01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.430]  You're a smart guy.
[01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:13.430]  I can ask a lot of questions, but keep digging into that.
[01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.430]  I mean, your view on this, what you're seeing happening,
[01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:19.430]  did the establishment think he would just disappear?
[01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:20.430]  No, they know better.
[01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:23.430]  And like I said, he's going to have even more control, more power
[01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:27.430]  if he can get this next setup right, and he'll be an even bigger voice.
[01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.430]  So I guess you saw this coming.
[01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.430]  I didn't know it was going to happen so fast.
[01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:35.430]  It still flabbergasted me that they would throw away that kind of impact,
[01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:38.430]  those kind of views, that kind of connection.
[01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:42.430]  But how much longer is mainstream media going to even be around at this point?
[01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:44.430]  Well, that's what most people are saying is Fox News is dead,
[01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.430]  cable news is already dead,
[01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:50.430]  so the last dinosaur has basically fallen into the mud and is dead.
[01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:53.430]  And then not to mention what we call these Web 2 platforms,
[01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.430]  everything from Facebook to the YouTubes,
[01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:56.430]  while Twitter is still debatable,
[01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:58.430]  how much longer are those going to be around
[01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:00.430]  where people can't have direct relationships with their fan base?
[01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:02.430]  That's kind of why I'm in town for the Blockchain Conference,
[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:05.430]  where people can actually have a direct relationship,
[01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:07.430]  cut out the middlemen, ultimately cut out the banks,
[01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:10.430]  cut out the governments, so we can really finally have a system
[01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:12.430]  where we can go peer-to-peer.
[01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:15.430]  I think that's where Tucker's heading, and I think this is a really good sign.
[01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:16.430]  Well, that's right.
[01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:17.430]  Was it three, three and a half years ago,
[01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:21.430]  you were routinely getting 2, 3 million, 4 million views on your show on YouTube,
[01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:24.430]  and they started censoring you, and I just, I mean, it wasn't rocket science.
[01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.430]  I said, you've got to launch your own thing.
[01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:28.430]  You've got to do it now, and you did it just in a few months,
[01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:29.430]  and it's been even more successful,
[01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:31.430]  and you're still able to be on all those other platforms,
[01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:33.430]  because as soon as you have your own thing,
[01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:36.430]  then they have a lot of trouble making the move to shut you down.
[01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:37.430]  It was a pivotal moment.
[01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:39.430]  It was April 6, 2020, Alex.
[01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:42.430]  I had the second largest YouTube live stream in the world.
[01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:46.430]  65,000 people tuned in to watch that conversation I had with David Icke.
[01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:48.430]  That's at any one time, so, yeah, then it builds up from there.
[01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:49.430]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:50.430]  It was massive.
[01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.430]  It would have gone on to be the most watched podcast in human history.
[01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:55.430]  It would have gone on to be watched maybe 40 million times.
[01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:59.430]  It would have edged out what at the time was Rogan and Musk, about 30 million,
[01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:03.430]  and yet 30 minutes later, YouTube banned and deleted that conversation.
[01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:05.430]  Alex, I've been broadcasting for nine years.
[01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:07.430]  Never once had I been censored,
[01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.430]  and that started this massive, massive fight that we had with these platforms.
[01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:14.430]  So is it safe to say, by you not rolling over, because I know you had a chance,
[01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:15.430]  I know they approach people.
[01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:16.430]  I'm guessing they approached you.
[01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:17.430]  Hey, just roll over.
[01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.430]  We'll leave you alone.
[01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:20.430]  Then you didn't roll over and became even more successful.
[01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.430]  Is that what happened?
[01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:22.430]  That's exactly what happened,
[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:26.430]  and I have recorded conversations of me with my YouTube representatives
[01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:29.430]  that are going to be in our documentary film that's coming out
[01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:32.430]  where I can literally see them basically violating laws,
[01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:34.430]  violating freedom of speech issues,
[01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:38.430]  going with their policy and completely contradicting themselves
[01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:41.430]  as they tried to censor me repeatedly throughout that time.
[01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.430]  We created our own platform, got bigger than ever,
[01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:46.430]  and now they've slowly acquiesced a little bit,
[01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:48.430]  but it's only going to come back.
[01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:49.430]  Exactly.
[01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:52.430]  These bullies and tyrants just run over you if you give in to them.
[01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:53.430]  You have to defeat them.
[01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:54.430]  They're not God.
[01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:55.430]  There's not just bad people in the world.
[01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:56.430]  There's people that want freedom,
[01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:59.430]  and I think the public now gets how serious things are,
[01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:01.430]  that there is a deep state, there is a uniparty,
[01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:02.430]  not just here but different countries,
[01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.430]  and as that awakening happens,
[01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:08.430]  I don't see how they're going to reverse this other than, I guess, a nuclear war,
[01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:11.430]  a controlled power outage, a cyber attack.
[01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:16.430]  How do you think these corrupt interests grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:19.430]  Well, first of all, it only takes a few people to push back, Alex.
[01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:20.430]  That's what's really important to remember,
[01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:23.430]  and what they do with these tech platforms, YouTube in particular,
[01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:26.430]  first they stop your virality.
[01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:28.430]  Then they take away your monetization.
[01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:29.430]  Then they give you a strike.
[01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:31.430]  Very few people, Alex, will keep on fighting,
[01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:34.430]  but if you do, you realize there's nothing there.
[01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:37.430]  It's like there's just somebody behind the curtain.
[01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:39.430]  It's like Neo and the Matrix.
[01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:40.430]  Yeah, it is.
[01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:43.430]  If you see it and blast through it, then their power diminishes,
[01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:44.430]  and the people are like, wait a second,
[01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.430]  it's just a few people that's controlling this,
[01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:50.430]  and once you push out, everyone can realize that we can fight back.
[01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:51.430]  But we've got some real issues to consider.
[01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:52.430]  No, I agree.
[01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:53.430]  It's not like we've won the war yet,
[01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:55.430]  but we're starting to win battle after battle after battle.
[01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:58.430]  It's like George Washington lost almost all the battles of the last year.
[01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:00.430]  They started winning them.
[01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:01.430]  I think we're crossing over that point,
[01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:03.430]  but I don't want to be overconfident.
[01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:04.430]  I'm going to ask the question again.
[01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:07.430]  What do you think the deep state is going to do to try to stop us?
[01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:10.430]  I'm really concerned about artificial intelligence coming up here.
[01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:11.430]  I don't know if they can control it.
[01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.430]  They're going to try to control it,
[01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:15.430]  but I really think it's something that we all need to really wake up
[01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:16.430]  and think about it.
[01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:17.430]  I've been going really deep on this lately, Alex.
[01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:19.430]  I've been having a lot of experts on my show
[01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:21.430]  looking at some of these companies and the tech.
[01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:22.430]  Quite frankly, it's frightening,
[01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:25.430]  and I don't think the public has their eye on it yet,
[01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:27.430]  and it's going to come very, very fast.
[01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:28.430]  Exponential growth.
[01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:30.430]  And you've been a big financial guy, a big banker,
[01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:31.430]  so you understand this stuff.
[01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:33.430]  Explain to them really what AI is,
[01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:36.430]  because they advertise as God is going to fix everything,
[01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:38.430]  but really it's whatever these people program it as.
[01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:39.430]  Yeah.
[01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:43.430]  First of all, it's been the largest adoption of technology in human history.
[01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:46.430]  This chat GPT thing went from zero to a million users in four days,
[01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:48.430]  went to 100 million users in two months.
[01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:50.430]  That's unprecedented.
[01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:52.430]  We've never seen that, not the Internet, not the mobile phone.
[01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:56.430]  This is potentially going to make humans obsolete,
[01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:58.430]  and I think we need to be aware of that
[01:13:58.430 --> 01:14:02.430]  and try to make sure it's not controlled by the big tech companies or government.
[01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:05.430]  We need to find a way to decentralize it and understand it,
[01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:07.430]  or it's really going to take over,
[01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.430]  and it's going to happen very quickly, Alex, within years.
[01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:10.430]  Well, absolutely.
[01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:12.430]  The globalists claim they want a worldwide government
[01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.430]  to stop disruptive technology,
[01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:18.430]  but then at the same time they're just racing ahead like mad scientists
[01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:20.430]  to get technology to control us
[01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:23.430]  when the technology they're creating is obviously the threat to them and us.
[01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:24.430]  It makes no sense.
[01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:26.430]  Yeah, and they can't control this.
[01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:27.430]  That's the other issue.
[01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:28.430]  Now, I've had people come to me and say,
[01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.430]  Brian, you're taking this out of context.
[01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.430]  When tractors came, then it made workers more productive.
[01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:36.430]  When computers came, it made the rest of us more productive.
[01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:38.430]  But artificial intelligence can improve on itself,
[01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:40.430]  and it will potentially make all of us obsolete
[01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:42.430]  in which we can do something about it.
[01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:45.430]  So I don't think the government really knows what they're playing with here.
[01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:46.430]  Oh, they don't.
[01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:49.430]  It's a mad gold rush where they're just trying to be the leader in it,
[01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:51.430]  as Elon Musk said, so there's no controls.
[01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:53.430]  Yeah, and Elon knows it better than anybody.
[01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:55.430]  He set up open AI in 2018,
[01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.430]  so it would be open-sourced, nonprofit.
[01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:59.430]  Of course, that got co-opted.
[01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:00.430]  It's no longer open-source.
[01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:01.430]  Microsoft now controls it.
[01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:02.430]  He's trying to set up his own.
[01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:05.430]  He at least is trying to move forward on freedom of speech.
[01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:07.430]  It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out,
[01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:09.430]  but this is a real war,
[01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:11.430]  and it's happening now probably in the next six months.
[01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:16.430]  When we come back, I want to ask you about AI and the economy and the wars,
[01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:17.430]  but also first Elon Musk,
[01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:21.430]  because obviously he's deep inside the establishment,
[01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:23.430]  but there's fissures in the establishment,
[01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:24.430]  and we have to expect it.
[01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:26.430]  As humanity wants freedom and we stand up and speak out,
[01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:29.430]  we have to be ready for big dogs in the system to join us.
[01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.430]  We can't be like, oh, we don't trust you now
[01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:33.430]  because you weren't with us before.
[01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:36.430]  No, I mean, as the worm turns, we have to be ready for victory.
[01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:39.430]  Very much so, and again, some people you think have one agenda,
[01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.430]  it flips into another agenda,
[01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:45.430]  and pretty soon they're actually exposing great tools that we can use in our agenda.
[01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:48.430]  I totally agree, because here's how I put it.
[01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:51.430]  The things Elon Musk is doing is so damaging to the globalist model,
[01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:53.430]  it's irreversible.
[01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:55.430]  They would not do this.
[01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:58.430]  I mean, what he's doing is crossing lines they don't cross.
[01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:01.430]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:04.430]  that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:07.430]  People said, no way he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:09.430]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:12.430]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him,
[01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.430]  but as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:17.430]  It's the same thing with Infowars,
[01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:21.430]  but Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros
[01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:23.430]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:27.430]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners,
[01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:29.430]  and when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:34.430]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:37.430]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:39.430]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.430]  I encourage you as listeners to understand,
[01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.430]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:45.430]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:48.430]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:51.430]  We're all getting great products at the same time at Infowars.com.
[01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:52.430]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:53.430]  Go to Infowars.com.

[01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:58.430]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:01.430]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs,
[01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:05.430]  not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:07.430]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:08.430]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:11.430]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:16.430]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:18.430]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:20.430]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:24.430]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front.
[01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:27.430]  They're in a mugshot jail background.
[01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:28.430]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:32.430]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:34.430]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:35.430]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:37.430]  It's a really nice navy blue, high-quality shirt.
[01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:38.430]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:39.430]  Alex Jones for president.
[01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:40.430]  2024.
[01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:42.430]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:44.430]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:52.430]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowarsstore.com
[01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:57.430]  or by calling toll-free, triple-A, 253-3139.
[01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:10.430]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food,
[01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:12.430]  but also your health supplements
[01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:15.430]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:17.430]  So support Infowarsstore.
[01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:20.430]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority
[01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:22.430]  because you don't know, I don't know.
[01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:25.430]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:30.430]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:31.430]  Krill oil.
[01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:36.430]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview
[01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:39.430]  of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:41.430]  And I would urge everyone,
[01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:42.430]  maybe you don't take vitamins,
[01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:44.430]  maybe you don't take nutritional supplements,
[01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:45.430]  but the day will come.
[01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:48.430]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:50.430]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:52.430]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:55.430]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:58.430]  You have to have these products.
[01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:03.430]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:06.430]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:09.430]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:12.430]  Period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:14.430]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:17.430]  made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:18.430]  It's been around about 15 years,
[01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:20.430]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:22.430]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered
[01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:26.430]  the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:30.430]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:33.430]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:34.430]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:37.430]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:40.430]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system
[01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:42.430]  for half the price of the leading competitor.
[01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:46.430]  And the media says we're bad and a cult
[01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:48.430]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:50.430]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:51.430]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:53.430]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:55.430]  The point is, you can get the filters at m4store.com.
[01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:56.430]  They're discounted right now.
[01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:58.430]  Finally back in stock.
[01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:04.430]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:06.430]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:08.430]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:23.760]  I want to get back into AI, I want to talk about Ukraine, the economy, you know, you've
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.680]  been a successful banker and, you know, been in high-level major companies, so I know that's
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.680]  some of your expertise.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.080]  I'll talk about the economy with you as well, but back to Elon Musk.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.920]  I'm not an apologist for Elon Musk, I'm not a fanboy, I'm not a cheerleader.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.200]  I just see him going from getting a lot of big government contracts and doing a lot of
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:47.480]  important work that he was successful at to now branching out and attacking, sterilizing
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.480]  children.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.000]  He should go to prison for life until their age of consent, you know, coming out against
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.840]  the censorship, exposing the illegal government surveillance at Twitter, you know, goes on
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.840]  everywhere else.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.000]  I mean, it would take an hour to list it all.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.320]  These things are irrevocably damaging them.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.280]  I'm watching them come after his companies, I'm watching his companies get hurt by it,
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.720]  but still like a kamikaze, he continues.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.800]  We could speculate all day about what's really going on, but this is very exciting.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.440]  But you look at what Tucker's doing.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.960]  These are bellwethers or major dominoes to fall, and I predict out of this desire for
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:22.040]  free will, this desire for renaissance, that we are not on the cusp, we've already gone
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.760]  over the top of a snowball that the establishment won't be able to stop.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.760]  What do you think?
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.160]  You know, I think when you start fighting for human rights and for free speech, it becomes
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160]  addictive.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.800]  So you can look back at a few years ago and look at what Elon was doing and you can have
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.800]  different opinions on that.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.900]  But once you get in the fight, Alex, I mean, I was, uh, they picked a fight with me back
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:40.900]  in 2020.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:44.880]  And once they did, I went all in on this, created the platform, started pushing back
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.880]  even harder.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.880]  And I think that's what I see in Elon.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:51.600]  I'm telling you, Alex, when he released those Twitter files, I had a moment because I thought
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:56.559]  I was going crazy, Alex, in April, 2020, when I got systematically deplatformed from PayPal,
[01:21:56.559 --> 01:21:58.480]  from Dropbox, from LinkedIn.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.640]  And I thought, wait a second, is there really a bunch of people acting together?
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.760]  And then I read the Twitter files.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.320]  I saw actors like the CIA, the FBI going in.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.920]  What I want to see, Alex, is the YouTube files, because I think they'll be more interesting.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.480]  And so, look, my hats are off to Elon.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.480]  I think he's with us.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.640]  I think he's going to keep pushing forward and throwing a monkey wrench in the establishment.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.640]  I agree.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:22.200]  You know, I covered this last hour, but U.S. Army high level psyops, expert, retired, said,
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.200]  look, they're threatening Fox with the CIA.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.320]  They're using the CIA.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.680]  I've experienced that myself.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.640]  It's come on congressional hearings.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.640]  But what do they do?
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:35.040]  They go offer employees money to lie about you, but there's no proof, so it goes nowhere.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.960]  That's now come out with this so-called employee suing him.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.120]  He never even met her or talked to her.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.120]  It's all just made up.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.600]  But, I mean, that's the best they've got.
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.519]  So, oh, a CIA title.
[01:22:44.519 --> 01:22:48.440]  Well, most of the former CIA and a lot of the current are on our side joining us now.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.400]  So don't be intimidated by the deep state, folks.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.460]  It's a joke.
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.080]  They're working for the collapsing system.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.080]  They're the fools.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.080]  They're the quislings.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:00.680]  Well, I mean, this information war is the stakes keep going up and up and up, Alex.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.120]  And I'm really curious where you think this is going to go, because, again, not to drum
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:08.280]  on again about A.I. again, but we're starting to see deep fakes that are real fakes.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.600]  We're starting to see voices.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.200]  We're starting to see pictures.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.600]  We're starting to see videos that are being created.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.559]  And again, you understand information wars better than anybody here.
[01:23:16.559 --> 01:23:19.680]  Are they taking things to the next level now and how are we going to be able to fight back?
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.680]  Funny you say that.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.680]  I'm sure you saw it.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.240]  said the State Department, the CIA are now deploying deep fakes for policy.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.360]  So they're the ones driving it while they warn us all about it.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.360]  Yeah.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.360]  I mean, this is happening out there.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.720]  You've probably seen the headlines about people's family getting kidnapped and them getting
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:39.680]  A.I. phone calls from their kids and, you know, doing the ransom thing right now in
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:40.680]  Kuwait.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:44.160]  They have a news anchor who's completely A.I. and people are buying into that in a weird
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.160]  way.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.920]  It feels like us as humans are even being conditioned to be welcoming these things kind of more
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:49.920]  into our lives.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.680]  We should create a human union that says, no, we want human hands to make it.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.680]  We want certified.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.680]  If anything's a fact checker, this is human.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:59.600]  We're going to have to find a way to verify these things in the in the future.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.600]  Truth.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.120]  That's why I'm a big fan of the block chain, because it's a public ledger that we can potentially
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.120]  all see.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:08.480]  But right now, I mean, you know what they've gone to the Wayback Machine and deleted things
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.480]  off the Wayback Machine.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.760]  I'm sure, you know, some of this stuff that Robert Malone was talking about the CIA was
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:13.760]  doing.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.800]  We don't even have a record of what is true that happened in the past and what's going
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.800]  to happen in the future.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.800]  I'm concerned.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.160]  I mean, I noticed suddenly the New York Times two weeks ago got caught.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:27.240]  There's thousands of examples just this month where they said that.
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.320]  Edward Snowden worked for WikiLeaks and published it, WikiLeaks.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.880]  He didn't publish it there.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.120]  He published it elsewhere.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.120]  That's a known lines.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.720]  And the New York Times said, we don't care.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.320]  So they're just planting completely fake things they know to create a false history.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]  Yeah.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.760]  And again, this whole Wayback Machine was supposed to be an exact copy of everything
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.240]  the Internet ever published.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.360]  But it looks like that has now been tampered with.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.360]  So what do we do going forward?
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:49.920]  How do we verify these things?
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.360]  I think a decentralized ledger where we can all have a copy of that, which means it can't
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.080]  be tweaked or messed with by government.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.080]  I agree.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.080]  This is the future.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.960]  There should be pro verification, free speech groups, not their fake fact checkers that
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:01.960]  we certify.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.960]  We believe in who then separately save the Internet and separately create archives and
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960]  then put out certifications.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.559]  Yes, it has to be going that going forward.
[01:25:10.559 --> 01:25:13.000]  What do you think Elon's going to do with this going forward?
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.720]  And where do you think his head lies?
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.320]  Is he going to keep pushing for freedom of speech?
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.680]  I mean, every tweet seems like he is on the right side.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:24.360]  Well, I mean, he's releasing the documents that prove the government was running Twitter.
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.320]  And basically, that means all the other major ones.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.000]  So, yeah, it's devastating.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.640]  I mean, what he's doing is devastating.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:33.519]  I mean, again, it shows us look, here's an example.
[01:25:33.519 --> 01:25:39.960]  On Monday, I had an extensive meeting with a high level federal official and federal
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.800]  officers who said, no, the government has tens of thousands and is letting kids be kidnapped.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.480]  And we have the documents and here it is, and it's going to be coming out soon.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.080]  And we want to, you know, give you more of this.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.600]  And this is really in court records.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.120]  So let me tell you, when you're sitting there talking about that level that are said, we're
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.559]  done, we're not part of this, the evil is so bad, it's going to force a bunch of good
[01:25:58.559 --> 01:26:03.480]  people that were on the fence or they didn't know what to do to take action.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:08.320]  So I think that's what there's a race to get AI in to head us off at the pass.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.880]  Do you see other tech platforms being alarmed by what Elon's doing?
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:16.240]  Do you think their policies are coming back a little bit, coming a little bit more to
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.760]  be accepting the free speech, right?
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:21.440]  And do you think that's temporary if it is?
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.640]  I have not seen Google or YouTube back off.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.640]  They've gotten worse.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:27.880]  But yes, Facebook has backed off a little.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.720]  And so some of the others after Elon and I, but I don't know if that's because of policy
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:38.080]  or because now Twitter is feeding so much truth because folks, Alex Jones is still banned,
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.920]  but the governor's off.
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:45.840]  And so, and I don't report that because the enemy already knows that, but I mean, I can
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.840]  see what he wants.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840]  I mean, Alex Jones is unbanned.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.280]  So we, I mean, I don't officially have a Twitter, but I'm been unbanned.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.120]  So see, I don't go with what somebody says, his attack on me was so ridiculous.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.120]  I can figure it out.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.120]  Now later, I'm not gonna get into it, but the point is, his attack on me a few months
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.519]  ago was so big, it was like, here, I'll free all these people, but you can crucify Alex
[01:27:03.519 --> 01:27:04.519]  Jones.
[01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:05.519]  I was like, great, do it.
[01:27:05.519 --> 01:27:08.000]  And then I can also see that the governor's been taken off.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.440]  And the bad guys know that.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.559]  You know, I've been systematically republishing videos that were banned and deleted in 2020
[01:27:14.559 --> 01:27:15.940]  back on YouTube.
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:16.940]  So far, so good.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.519]  I probably put up a couple hundred videos.
[01:27:18.519 --> 01:27:21.600]  We'll see if there's a pushback, but I think they're seeing what's happening out there
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.440]  and they can't be as draconian as they used to be.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.360]  We need to take this momentum and find a way again, to find some decentralized social media,
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.760]  do the kind of thing you're doing where you can get the information directly to the people.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.760]  And that's what I've been working on.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.360]  But I can tell you what's happened on YouTube with you.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.240]  When you were doing that, it's groundbreaking.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.720]  When you were one of the first with myself and David Icke and others, it was super dangerous
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.960]  because you were at the tip of the spear.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.280]  Now they've already lost that fight with the shots and not working and all that.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.680]  So they're kind of like, oh, they're letting you put up the old stuff now because they
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.680]  already lost that fight.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.680]  See?
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.680]  Yeah, no, it's definitely true.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.720]  It's not as effective as it was back then in 2020.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.760]  It's just interesting to see the tides go back and forth.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.200]  I think they're very concerned about their own files being released at some point.
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.380]  And again, there's criminal action there.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.920]  So it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.680]  Oh, it's totally criminal to collude with the government secretly.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.160]  They've all lied to Congress saying they weren't.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160]  It's all confirmed.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.160]  They did it.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.160]  Yeah.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.160]  We know the dashboard documents even from Twitter that have come out.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:17.160]  They were coordinating with all the other tech companies, not just the big other four
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.760]  or five, but dozens of them.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.160]  Were you surprised at anything in those Twitter files?
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.960]  No, because we'd already gotten pieces of it everywhere.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960]  I already had.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.559]  Mike Stern, which is great.
[01:28:26.559 --> 01:28:30.200]  He put me in touch with Google whistleblowers when I was first getting deplatformed four
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.200]  or five years ago.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:34.400]  That was the documents and the dashboards of what they were doing.
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.400]  So we already knew.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.400]  And it was all hooked into the other tech.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.400]  They were all coordinating.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.040]  So a lot of this had already come out.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.120]  It's just that with the Twitter files, you can't deny it.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.639]  It's like all in one big piece.
[01:28:42.639 --> 01:28:45.160]  And yet the Twitter files themselves have been suppressed by mainstream media, which
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.120]  means the average Joe in public still doesn't understand the ramifications of the Twitter
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.120]  files.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.120]  Exactly.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.120]  Amazing.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.120]  Mr. Rose, stay right there.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.120]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.120]  London Real TV.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:05.560]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.560]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that's ever happened.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.560]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.560]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.560]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.560]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:24.560]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.560]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.560]  And when you support us, we are unstoppable.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.560]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.560]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.560]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:44.560]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.560]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.560]  while getting great products at the same time at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.560]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.560]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.560]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.560]  And never submit to these tyrants.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.560]  Turbo Force is back.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.560]  Sold out for eight months.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.560]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.560]  We made it even stronger.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:09.560]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:16.560]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:23.560]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over ten hours.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.560]  It should be called ten-hour energy.
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:30.560]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:37.560]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.560]  It is the super fuel.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.560]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.560]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.560]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560]  They go good with this.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.560]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560]  This is the boss.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.560]  Turbo Force.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.560]  Back in stock.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.560]  Discounted.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.560]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:54.560]  More power.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:55.560]  More strength.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.560]  More energy.
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:05.560]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to Infowarsstore.com
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:10.560]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.560]  and keep us on air.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:16.560]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.560]  many of you for years, and never gone to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:25.560]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to Infowarsstore.com
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.560]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.560]  Sure, you share a link.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.560]  You share an article.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.560]  You tell folks about the show.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.560]  That's great, and I thank you.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:34.560]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:38.560]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.560]  and our Fizzy Magnesium and our Sleep Aid and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.560]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.560]  They keep us on air.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.560]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560]  So, get off the bench.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.560]  Get in the game.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:55.560]  Step to the plate and go to Infowarsstore.com right now and get these great Infowars products
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.560]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:03.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic book
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.560]  that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.560]  That is a hellish future.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.560]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:16.560]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores,
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.560]  Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.560]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:26.560]  we got run out, and there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:31.560]  So, get your copy of The Great Reset and War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:35.560]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:39.560]  So, you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.560]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:45.560]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:50.560]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com and get a signed
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:54.560]  copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies, and donate them to the library, or give them
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:55.560]  to the local school.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:58.560]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:04.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:20.030]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:25.030]  We will not be silent.
[01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:27.030]  Ryan Rose of Londonreal.tv is here in studio with us.
[01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:28.030]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:29.030]  And notice the theme.
[01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:34.030]  They tried to silence him, only made him bigger because he persevered and didn't give up and
[01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:37.030]  reached out to others to join him in a quest for human freedom.
[01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:39.030]  And you have had such a massive effect.
[01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.030]  Most of the listeners know who you are.
[01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:46.030]  But, I mean, so many times, critical big stories that really broke through, you and your team
[01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:50.030]  got it done, and that's because other fellow humans believed in it and joined with you
[01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:51.030]  at the work.
[01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:53.030]  So now you've got a documentary coming out.
[01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:57.030]  Now that we're several years into the censorship and control to tell your story, will your
[01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:59.030]  documentary save the world?
[01:33:59.030 --> 01:34:00.030]  Will Alex's world save the world?
[01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:03.030]  Will my book, Great Reset and the War for the World?
[01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:04.030]  No.
[01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:07.030]  But the fact that all of us together contributing will save the world.
[01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:09.030]  And I use this example earlier.
[01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:12.030]  The CIA, the FBI, they're all weaponized.
[01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:13.030]  They're spying on us.
[01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:14.030]  They're censoring.
[01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:16.030]  They're in interfaces digitally.
[01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:19.030]  And yes, remember they wanted the Justice Department two and a half years ago when parents
[01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:21.030]  didn't like critical race theory or transgenderism.
[01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:22.030]  They talked to their kids.
[01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:24.030]  They were just speaking up at city council.
[01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:26.030]  They said, we'll send the feds, call them terrorists.
[01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:31.030]  It turns out Biden two years ago sent letters to the teachers unions to say, call for us
[01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:32.030]  to come.
[01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:35.030]  They want to use the government to intimidate parents.
[01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:36.030]  Did that work?
[01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:39.030]  No parents got even more aggressive and started speaking out nonviolently.
[01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:42.030]  So, okay, use the CIA on Alex Jones.
[01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:43.030]  Use it on Tucker Carlson.
[01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:46.030]  Use MI6 or MI5 on London Real.
[01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:51.030]  Use people to lie about us and plant stories and say we're this and that and call us Nazis.
[01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:52.030]  Everybody gets your MO.
[01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:54.030]  It doesn't work.
[01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:59.030]  At the same time, I've got people in every age as you can imagine and former as well
[01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:02.030]  that are giving us the Intel and fighting and are totally awake and pissed.
[01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:07.030]  So we've passed the point where we have more people in the deep state than they have.
[01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:08.030]  They just have the folks on the top.
[01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:11.030]  But as you said earlier, Brian, it's the next shoe to drop.
[01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:18.030]  The people that are going to Wikileak or whistleblow out of Google, out of Apple, out of Facebook.
[01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:19.030]  And that's why they're so concerned.
[01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:21.030]  But that's also what makes them so dangerous.
[01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:23.030]  So tell us about your new documentary and we'll play the trailer.
[01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:26.030]  So we were at the tip of the spear when this all happened.
[01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:30.030]  As you know, Alex, on April 6th of 2020, you were one of the first people to call me up and said,
[01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:31.030]  Brian, come on the show.
[01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:32.030]  And I remember you asked me, Alex.
[01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:35.030]  You said, Brian, what made you fight back?
[01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:36.030]  Like, what was that reaction?
[01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:40.030]  And it was just this visceral reaction inside of me, Alex, that just said, wait a second.
[01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:41.030]  There's so many more at that point.
[01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:42.030]  Now it's contagious.
[01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:43.030]  I know.
[01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:44.030]  And now revisionist history.
[01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:47.030]  Everybody talks about how they were fighting for that back in April.
[01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:52.030]  Back in April, there was very few people that were bold enough to even come in the office,
[01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:56.030]  let alone broadcast, let alone broadcast messages that contrary to the WHO and all that.
[01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:58.030]  Take us back to that time because you're a nice guy.
[01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:59.030]  Let me talk.
[01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:00.030]  I'll run over you.
[01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:02.030]  But let's not forget.
[01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:09.030]  January, February, March, April, April, the peak point of almost everybody rolling over, going along with it.
[01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:13.030]  You know, the daily wires, almost all of them said, take your shots, keep the lockdown going.
[01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:16.030]  But you and I and others, we didn't go along with it.
[01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:17.030]  Yeah.
[01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:18.030]  I mean, the timeline was crazy.
[01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:19.030]  It was January.
[01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:21.030]  The virus is being reported.
[01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:23.030]  February, it was kind of coming into the U.K.
[01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:25.030]  March, they were talking about lockdown.
[01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:28.030]  We put these messages out there, and then I got banned across all platforms.
[01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:30.030]  We had to fight back.
[01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:32.030]  We were the only people that were fighting back.
[01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:35.030]  We were having in-person conversations and broadcasting them out.
[01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:36.030]  And they were going viral, Alex.
[01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:37.030]  They were going all around the world.
[01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:43.030]  And it was people like you that championed us and then said, Brian, you've got to ask for help and you've got to fight back.
[01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:51.030]  And that was a big moment for us when we asked everyone around the world, the London Real Army, to help us, to help us build this brand new digital freedom platform.
[01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:57.030]  And then on May 3rd, we pulled off the largest live stream broadcast of a human conversation, me and David Icke.
[01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:59.030]  I mean, if you remember, Alex, there were no sporting events at the time.
[01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:01.030]  Everybody was locked inside.
[01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:02.030]  Everybody was scared.
[01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:08.030]  And we were putting out things that, guess what, Alex, in retrospect, 98 percent of what we were saying was true.
[01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:12.030]  But back then, lab leak theory, you were going to be put in a padded room, right?
[01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:13.030]  Questioning the vaccine.
[01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:15.030]  Deplatformed everywhere.
[01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:16.030]  Asking about masks.
[01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:17.030]  Asking about social distancing.
[01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:19.030]  Nobody was doing that.
[01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:20.030]  And again, I keep harping on this.
[01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:21.030]  Guys, just type in.
[01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:22.030]  Everybody's seen the headlines.
[01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:23.030]  London Guardian.
[01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:24.030]  London Telegraph.
[01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:28.030]  The National Post out of Canada.
[01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:29.030]  The Washington Post.
[01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:31.030]  U.S. intelligence agencies.
[01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:32.030]  U.K. intelligence agencies.
[01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:40.030]  German E.U. intelligence agencies are helping use shy ops to scare people to stay in lockdowns and take future shots and to censor disinformation.
[01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:42.030]  So again, we were up against intelligence agencies.
[01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:43.030]  Yeah.
[01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:44.030]  That's illegal.
[01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:45.030]  Yeah.
[01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:46.030]  That's illegal.
[01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:48.030]  And now with the Twitter files, it's all become into perspective.
[01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:49.030]  But the thing that killed me is this, Alex.
[01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:53.030]  When they took away my right to broadcast, I stood up and said, wait a second.
[01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:54.030]  First Amendment.
[01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:55.030]  This is my right to free speech.
[01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:57.030]  And everyone stood up and said, no, no, no.
[01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:58.030]  It's a private company.
[01:37:58.030 --> 01:38:01.030]  You said yes to their policy, so you have to acquiesce to that.
[01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:07.030]  Later, I find out, Alex, that these same government officials that were supposed to protect my human rights went around and censored the company.
[01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:09.030]  So they have the best of both worlds.
[01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:13.030]  They denied it to my face and then they went ahead and made the company censor me.
[01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:16.030]  The public needs to know about what happened.
[01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:17.030]  I want to ask about YouTube.
[01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:19.030]  I want the Google files out.
[01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:20.030]  I want the Facebook files out.
[01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:29.030]  And again, this documentary film that we have has I have recorded conversations with YouTube officials trying to censor me, telling me things that were just breaking laws.
[01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:31.030]  And we're going to put it all out there in the documentary.
[01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:32.030]  Let's go ahead and roll the trailer.
[01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:45.030]  The past few weeks seem like a blur.
[01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:49.030]  Our homes became prisons.
[01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:55.030]  Mothers are afraid to touch their children.
[01:38:55.030 --> 01:39:01.030]  Debates are a danger to public health.
[01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:09.030]  And we're a few seconds away from streaming one of the most controversial conversations of the decade.
[01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:11.030]  Cameras are ready.
[01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:15.030]  We are ready.
[01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:21.030]  But I wonder, is the world ready?
[01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:22.030]  This is London Real.
[01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:23.030]  I am Brian Rose.
[01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:25.030]  My guest today is David Icke.
[01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:28.030]  What happened after that broadcast, Brian?
[01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:32.030]  London Real had an interview with David Icke, was removed from YouTube.
[01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:35.030]  If you take that guy off, you just make him bigger.
[01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:41.030]  Awaken to who you really are.
[01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:45.030]  I want to be with Brian Rose and David Icke in the universe.
[01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:49.030]  That is the future, and that will never be defeated.
[01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:55.030]  What the hell just happened?
[01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:56.030]  We will not be silenced.
[01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:57.030]  Wow, when does this come out?
[01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:58.030]  It comes out in July.
[01:39:58.030 --> 01:40:00.030]  It's going to blow everyone's mind.
[01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:03.030]  And remind them that we're still in this information war, Alex.
[01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.030]  I want to be.
[01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:05.030]  The next question.
[01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:07.030]  They're not going to give up.
[01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:09.030]  They admit new diseases they're going to release.
[01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:10.030]  New censorship.
[01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:11.030]  This was the beta test.
[01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:13.030]  So people need to go, whoa, we kind of won this war.
[01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:14.030]  They killed a bunch of people.
[01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:15.030]  They took a bunch of our rights.
[01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:16.030]  A bunch of people committed suicide.
[01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:17.030]  Mask on kids.
[01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:18.030]  All the problems.
[01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:19.030]  But we're like, oh, we're glad we're out of that.
[01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:22.030]  Because as successful people, we kind of brush ourselves off and aren't victims.
[01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:24.030]  We kind of get over the trauma.
[01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:25.030]  No, no, no.
[01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:26.030]  Don't get over the trauma.
[01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:28.030]  Remember it to stop the next wave.
[01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:30.030]  Yeah, well, David Ike calls it the totalitarian tiptoe.
[01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:35.030]  We've actually been now conditioned to where we'll go back into lockdown on a moment's notice.
[01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:37.030]  We'll go use a QR code.
[01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:41.030]  We've actually been trained, Alex, to go right back into this whenever it's deemed necessary.
[01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:43.030]  So we have to be even more vigilant than ever.
[01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:44.030]  And guess what?
[01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:49.030]  Their information powers, their powers to come after us are just getting better and better and better.
[01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:51.030]  And with AI, there's lots of other issues.
[01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:52.030]  So we have to stay vigilant.
[01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:54.030]  Most people don't even know this story happened.
[01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:57.030]  We have to remind people that this is a constant threat.
[01:40:57.030 --> 01:41:02.030]  Yeah, they want us to forget how they tried to muzzle and did hundreds of thousands of medical professionals,
[01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:04.030]  thousands of doctors, members of Congress.
[01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:07.030]  Rand Paul, it was a year after you and I exposed it.
[01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:10.030]  But like a year and a half after, he was agreeing and they were censoring him.
[01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:12.030]  This is a U.S. senator.
[01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:16.030]  I mean, at the time on our digital freedom platform, after we had Ike, Alex, after we had you on the show,
[01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:18.030]  I had 50 other doctors.
[01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:20.030]  I had people from the Great Barrington Declaration.
[01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:21.030]  I had to put it there.
[01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:23.030]  They were all speaking the truth, all being censored.
[01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:25.030]  Only now is some of that coming to the surface.
[01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:30.030]  And you're trying to save lives, and you're on your independent platform getting millions, not tens of millions.
[01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:31.030]  And it's so frustrating.
[01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:34.030]  Like, you want to tell people, hey, vitamin C, vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine.
[01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:37.030]  You want to tell them, but you're not allowed.
[01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:38.030]  Yeah, and now we know why.
[01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:41.030]  Now we can see all the evidence of why that was being held back.
[01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:43.030]  We can see the doctors that were persecuted.
[01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:45.030]  We see the science that was being violated.
[01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:47.030]  I mean, I come from a science background, Alex.
[01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:50.030]  It's just hard to believe, and yet most people still don't really know what happened.
[01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:52.030]  Hey, is it too late to skip this break?
[01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:57.030]  Skip it.
[01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:58.030]  All right, keep going.
[01:41:58.030 --> 01:42:02.030]  Yeah, so we have to just make sure it goes front and center again, because, again, it just goes back down under.
[01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:04.030]  Like you said, most people think it's over.
[01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:05.030]  It'll never happen again.
[01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:06.030]  That'll never happen again.
[01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:10.030]  It will happen again, and now we've been conditioned so it'll even happen easier next time.
[01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:14.030]  And they've said it will happen again, and they're building these camps all over the world.
[01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:16.030]  Yeah, there's a lot of scary things happening.
[01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:18.030]  Again, look to China.
[01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:19.030]  It's coming here.
[01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:22.030]  Look at what they're doing with the CBDCs, the monitoring, everything like that.
[01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:24.030]  It's slowly going to come here.
[01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:26.030]  People think it's not happening, but it is.
[01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:30.030]  We have to be really vigilant, Alex, and that's why independent media is crucial.
[01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:33.030]  It's crucial what you're doing, what we're doing, and what Tucker's putting out.
[01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:37.030]  This question, you're a former very successful banker and Wall Street guy.
[01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:40.030]  Looking at the world economic situation, where is it right now?
[01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:42.030]  Well, you know, it's pretty interesting to see what's happening.
[01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:45.030]  Obviously, during lockdown, we saw the massive printing of fiat currencies.
[01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:48.030]  I'm here in Austin because I'm at the blockchain conference,
[01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:52.030]  so we're looking at alternative forms of money, alternative forms of communication
[01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:55.030]  that don't require these institutions like banks and governments.
[01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:57.030]  What we're looking at is a pretty dire situation,
[01:42:57.030 --> 01:43:01.030]  and again, what we're trying to do is give the power back to the people.
[01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:04.030]  What I want is for people to have a relationship with money,
[01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:07.030]  because I think I had a guest on my show recently, Alex, named Dan Held.
[01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:09.030]  He's out of Texas as well, and he said,
[01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:12.030]  Brian, without financial freedom, we can't even have freedom of speech.
[01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:13.030]  That's the foundation.
[01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:15.030]  Yeah, it is. It really is.
[01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:18.030]  In fact, they say first, second, yes, speech is number one, defense is number two,
[01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:21.030]  but they really should have almost had, you know,
[01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:23.030]  the first amendment should have been the second amendment,
[01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.030]  and the second should have been the third.
[01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:29.030]  It should be financial independence and a currency they don't control.
[01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:30.030]  Yeah, and look what they're doing now.
[01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:31.030]  They're rolling out the CBDCs.
[01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:34.030]  The one in China with the yuan, it's dark.
[01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:35.030]  I've already heard.
[01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:37.030]  I think about 100, 150 million people already have access to it.
[01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:40.030]  The U.S. is rolling out this FedNow program in July.
[01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:43.030]  People don't understand the ramifications of the CBDC.
[01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:46.030]  Imagine them giving you money and be able to take it back to you at any point in time
[01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:48.030]  based on your spending habits, based on what you say.
[01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:49.030]  Track where you spend it.
[01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:51.030]  Track where you spend it, and now it's on the blockchain.
[01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:53.030]  It can be suspended at any point in time.
[01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:55.030]  You want to talk about controlling the people?
[01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:58.030]  It'll make the information, the censorship on Web2 platforms, the masks,
[01:43:58.030 --> 01:44:01.030]  it'll make it look like child's play, Alex,
[01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:03.030]  when they can pull your money at a moment's notice,
[01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:05.030]  and yet I think people still don't know it's coming.
[01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:08.030]  So we've got to fight back against this and keep the dollar free.
[01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:10.030]  It's crucial.
[01:44:10.030 --> 01:44:11.030]  I agree. Here's the good news.
[01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:13.030]  Six months ago, a year ago, two years ago,
[01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:15.030]  we were talking about central bank digital currencies.
[01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:16.030]  Nobody knew what it was.
[01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:17.030]  Now they've got legislation.
[01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:20.030]  Senators are talking about it, House members, people around the world.
[01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:23.030]  There is an awakening curve, but it's not fast enough.
[01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:24.030]  Yeah, it's not fast enough.
[01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:28.030]  At least we now know because we play with these digital currencies like the Bitcoins and Ethereums.
[01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:31.030]  We know what it is, but they're rolling it out anyways,
[01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:34.030]  and they keep people busy with look over here, look over here,
[01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:37.030]  and all of a sudden you're going to be forced to do something.
[01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:40.030]  Alex, I know so many people in London who were, quote-unquote,
[01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:42.030]  forced to take the vaccine, taxi drivers,
[01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:46.030]  all these people who were pressured into doing it because they saw no other alternative.
[01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:49.030]  That's what the U.S. and other countries are going to do with CBDCs.
[01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:50.030]  We've got to fight back.
[01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:53.030]  This is our most important fight ever.
[01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:56.030]  I totally agree with you, Brian.
[01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:58.030]  I could ask a hundred questions, but what do you want to get into next?
[01:44:58.030 --> 01:45:02.030]  You know, again, we want to get this message out as far as information.
[01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:06.030]  We want to tell the story about what happened to us as far as the censoring
[01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:09.030]  because it's continuing to happen, and it's going to come back in in another way
[01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:11.030]  that I think is going to be even worse.
[01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:14.030]  So what I want to do now is just decentralize everything, Alex.
[01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:15.030]  I want to get it peer-to-peer.
[01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:18.030]  One thing I didn't mention is that big live stream we did on May 3rd.
[01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:22.030]  Two-thirds of the viewers of that came from peer-to-peer sharing,
[01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:25.030]  nothing to do with a big platform, no social search.
[01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:29.030]  So you're literally, we're building by using it, by us doing it, by them using it.
[01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:30.030]  We're building a new infrastructure.
[01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:33.030]  Yes, and that's crucial, and it has to be money-based.
[01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:35.030]  It has to be community-based and information-based.
[01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:40.030]  If we don't build this now and we've got a short window and check the AI coming,
[01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:43.030]  we don't really have much of a future, and it's all happening very fast.
[01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:44.030]  Well, let me back up what you said.
[01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:46.030]  You said they're going to hit us with something even worse.
[01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:49.030]  The restrictat is an Internet ID.
[01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:54.030]  If you use VPNs, they can put you in jail for 20 years if they want.
[01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:56.030]  It surveils everything in the name of countering Huawei.
[01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:58.030]  It has nothing to do with Huawei.
[01:45:58.030 --> 01:46:01.030]  It accesses all the new smart devices in your home.
[01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:03.030]  Let's the government take those over.
[01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:04.030]  It's so outrageous.
[01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:05.030]  They don't even want to write the bill.
[01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:07.030]  They've got that and all these other systems.
[01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:11.030]  So they're trying to deploy all this right now ahead of something big.
[01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:14.030]  Yeah, and once they have a record of all of your information, all of your activity,
[01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:18.030]  then it's very easy to go after you in the future for anything that they choose.
[01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:19.030]  So this is happening again.
[01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:20.030]  You power it with AI.
[01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:22.030]  It gets even more dangerous.
[01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:25.030]  So we just all have to be super vigilant.
[01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:27.030]  And it's a narrative that maybe exhausts people after a while,
[01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:29.030]  but it's just as important to push it.
[01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:31.030]  Well, I'm going to ask viewers and listeners this.
[01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:37.030]  Do you think things will be better if we submit or worse if we don't submit?
[01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:39.030]  Obviously, submission to this is death.
[01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:42.030]  But I want to say to people that work for the system, I know you're all compartmentalized.
[01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:46.030]  Most of you aren't looking at this from a decompartmentalized model.
[01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:50.030]  That's why London Real, that's why Tucker Carlson, that's why InfoWars is so important.
[01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:54.030]  This former top Army psychological warfare operations officer said,
[01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:57.030]  Tucker Carlson is dangerous because he's decompartmentalizing
[01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:58.030]  and showing people the big picture.
[01:46:58.030 --> 01:47:02.030]  Because once the average person and people that work in the system realize,
[01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:07.030]  wait, I'm building my own guillotine, if we get this awareness out early enough,
[01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:13.030]  we can all peacefully noncompliant sabotage it like Mahatma Gandhi did and build a new system.
[01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:15.030]  And all you have to do is say no, Alex.
[01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:18.030]  There's plenty of examples in human history where enough people just said no,
[01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:21.030]  we're not having it, and the government will back off.
[01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:24.030]  The people in power will back off because they're a few.
[01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:27.030]  They're not as powerful as we think they are, but they make it out as if they are.
[01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:29.030]  Why would even these elites build something like this?
[01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:31.030]  Chivalry wasn't a wimpy thing.
[01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:34.030]  People said don't attack women and children because they didn't want their women and children attacked
[01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:36.030]  when they went out and attacked the other men.
[01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:40.030]  Why do they get rid of checks and balances that our civilization, thinking as elites, it protects them?
[01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:43.030]  If I was one of these elitists, I would want all the checks and balances.
[01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:45.030]  That protects them, not just us.
[01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:47.030]  You would think so. It's counterintuitive.
[01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:50.030]  But if you could empower everybody to be the best version of themselves,
[01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:54.030]  then yeah, we would have this incredible, productive, growing economy and growing world.
[01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:56.030]  But they're scared. This has worked in the past.
[01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:59.030]  It's a short-term fix, and it works.
[01:47:59.030 --> 01:48:01.030]  That's it. They're doing a short-term fix.
[01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:04.030]  Like Fire Carlson now don't think he'll be ten times bigger next week.
[01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:05.030]  Any idiot would know that.
[01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:06.030]  And it's the same thing.
[01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:11.030]  Everything they do, like attacking and going into Ukraine and starting a war with Russia,
[01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:14.030]  and then they do a counteroffensive, and then now they're moving away from the dollar,
[01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:18.030]  and it's hurting the globalists, but they thought one-dimensional.
[01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:21.030]  Yeah, this is evidence they're not as smart as we think they are.
[01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:23.030]  They're playing checkers. You think they're playing chess. They're just not.
[01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:25.030]  And it's not more complicated than that.
[01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:28.030]  Like you said, these knee-jerk reactions, sometimes short-term views,
[01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:33.030]  but over time, systematically, without people pushing back, it's effective.
[01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:40.030]  But more than just them being – because they are the grandchildren of the elites,
[01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:43.030]  and they are decadent, and they are getting lazier and lazier,
[01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:45.030]  but they have a lot of competent people working for them.
[01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:48.030]  But Hitler knew when he attacked Russia he'd probably lose.
[01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:53.030]  He knew when he started a three-front war, North Africa, Russia, and with the West, that he'd lose.
[01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:55.030]  But if you read his writings towards the end, he said,
[01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:59.030]  my main message is just kill all the Jews and wreak havoc,
[01:48:59.030 --> 01:49:01.030]  and the Germans deserve to die.
[01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:05.030]  He flooded the subways, and he knew he was getting Germany annihilated.
[01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:07.030]  He just liked the ride.
[01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:10.030]  And so we have to kind of understand, these psychos just like to do bad stuff.
[01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:12.030]  I think we've got some real psychos in charge here.
[01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:14.030]  It's very possible. I mean, you look at some of the behavior,
[01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:18.030]  and it doesn't make a lot of sense, and they've been in this power position for a long time.
[01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:21.030]  I think they're also using an old playbook, Alex, and it worked in the past,
[01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:24.030]  and it was easier for it to work in the past.
[01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:26.030]  I mean, we didn't have people like you and me in the past.
[01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:28.030]  All the media really was controlled.
[01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:32.030]  So yeah, they aren't making, obviously, the most intelligent decisions, which is great.
[01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:35.030]  We should see that as like a crack in the armor and push forward,
[01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:39.030]  but it needs more people to be aware, more people to just put back and say no.
[01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:41.030]  Say, I'm not giving you that information.
[01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:43.030]  No, I'm not going to allow that to happen with my schools.
[01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:44.030]  I'm not going to allow it.
[01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:46.030]  I realize how much people think of themselves as little.
[01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:47.030]  So powerful.
[01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:49.030]  Exactly. All of us together, little decisions are big.
[01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:52.030]  Yeah, and it just has to – all you have to do is step up,
[01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:54.030]  and I know it's going to be slightly inconvenient,
[01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:58.030]  but you've just got to push back and say no, we are not having this.
[01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:59.030]  We are not accepting this.
[01:49:59.030 --> 01:50:01.030]  Because giving in is a trillion times more inconvenient.
[01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:05.030]  Yeah, it is, and again, you're going to have to answer to your children and to your grandchildren,
[01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:06.030]  and they're going to ask you questions.
[01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:08.030]  What did you do in the 20s?
[01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:10.030]  What did you do to facilitate the pushback?
[01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:12.030]  And you're going to have to give them an answer,
[01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:16.030]  and the future is ugly and dystopian unless we all stand up and be counted now.
[01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:20.030]  And we know future does repeat and it does rhyme.
[01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:24.030]  We have an RFK, dad and uncle killed, now running for president.
[01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:28.030]  We have the 20s leading into the fascism in World War II,
[01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:31.030]  and probably a collapse by the end of this decade.
[01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:34.030]  I mean, do you not see history repeating but on a more grand scale?
[01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:35.030]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:38.030]  I mean, we had Robert Kennedy on the digital freedom platform
[01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:40.030]  because he wasn't allowed on YouTube at the time.
[01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:43.030]  It's fascinating to see him now coming out and pushing back.
[01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:44.030]  Breaking out.
[01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:45.030]  Yeah, breaking out.
[01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:48.030]  The massive censorship he's gone through, it's just incredible.
[01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:50.030]  It almost boggles my mind what they've done to him.
[01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:53.030]  He had the best-selling books in the country.
[01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:55.030]  Of course, it's not on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:59.030]  Suppressed in all ways, shape, or form, and yet people don't even give him a chance.
[01:50:59.030 --> 01:51:02.030]  That's the thing, Alex, about people like you and Ike and Robert Kennedy.
[01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:04.030]  They don't even know you or what you talk about.
[01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:07.030]  All they know is that people say not to listen to you.
[01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:09.030]  If you actually listen to Kennedy for ten minutes,
[01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:12.030]  you realize he's actually a very reasonable, very knowledgeable guy
[01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:13.030]  who really cares about the people.
[01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:14.030]  Who'd make a great president.
[01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:15.030]  Yeah, who'd make a great president.
[01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:16.030]  Same with you.
[01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:17.030]  Same with people like me.
[01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:20.030]  Again, the media, they con everyone into saying,
[01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:23.030]  oh no, don't listen to these people because they're bad.
[01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:24.030]  That's the thing.
[01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:27.030]  So people really have to take the time, walk a mile in a man's shoes,
[01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:31.030]  see what the total of what they're talking about, thinking about,
[01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:32.030]  and then make a judgment.
[01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:36.030]  Exactly, and realize that I know you want to just watch movies at night
[01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:38.030]  and have fun and eat dinner and you worked all day,
[01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:40.030]  but folks, we're going to lose everything if we don't do this,
[01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:42.030]  and it's also an animating contest.
[01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:45.030]  So whoever they're saying don't listen to, you should listen to.
[01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:46.030]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:48.030]  If someone is telling you not to listen to someone,
[01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:50.030]  you should want to go seek out and find out why.
[01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:51.030]  And yes, you said it really well, Alex.
[01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:53.030]  We have to be proactive here.
[01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:55.030]  I always say, what am I going to tell my children and grandchildren
[01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:59.030]  when they say, Papa, what did you do in the great crisis of 2020?
[01:51:59.030 --> 01:52:01.030]  Did you sit back and watch Netflix on binge?
[01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:03.030]  Did you go have a snack or did you fight?
[01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:06.030]  We all need to be proactive about our future.
[01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:07.030]  And notice they play to our laziness.
[01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:11.030]  Just stay home, drink beer, order Uber Eats,
[01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:13.030]  and then meanwhile the whole civilization collapses.
[01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:16.030]  Yeah, and it was completely coordinated and it was all dominated.
[01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:17.030]  They controlled our information.
[01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:18.030]  They controlled everything.
[01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:19.030]  And we fell right into it.
[01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:21.030]  So everyone has to take ownership.
[01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:25.030]  And again, it's ultimately all about love.
[01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:26.030]  Like do you care about this world?
[01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:29.030]  Do you want the best for this world, for your children, for everybody?
[01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:31.030]  I totally agree with you, but from a sociopath view,
[01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:34.030]  and I'm not a sociopath, the opposite, I have deep empathy,
[01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:36.030]  but looking at a sociopath who's thinking only one step ahead
[01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:39.030]  and not 10 steps ahead, this is so destructive,
[01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:43.030]  this anti-human world, a capitalist, free market, laissez-faire,
[01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:46.030]  libertarian, true liberal society is awesome.
[01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:48.030]  And that's what everybody wanted.
[01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:52.030]  Why join corporate fascists saying they're liberals that are destroying it?
[01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:57.030]  I mean 99.99% of people are not going to do well in this new world order.
[01:52:57.030 --> 01:53:00.030]  So even a sociopath, why would you go along with this?
[01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:01.030]  Yeah, I know.
[01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:02.030]  It's mind-boggling.
[01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:03.030]  But they're thinking short term.
[01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:06.030]  And like I think, Alex, they're running an old playbook on repeat
[01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:08.030]  that's worked for them in the past.
[01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:10.030]  But this is a new system now.
[01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:14.030]  We have new ways of information, new ways of compensating each other directly.
[01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:15.030]  It's going to break down.
[01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:16.030]  But people should see this.
[01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:17.030]  This is a crack in the armor.
[01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:19.030]  This could be one of our last chances, Alex.
[01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:23.030]  That's why we have to stay vigilant because it's only going to get more advanced.
[01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:24.030]  I totally agree.
[01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:27.030]  And as dark as things seem, I can sense historically and also feel,
[01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:30.030]  which is really your subconscious more powerful than your conscious,
[01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:33.030]  that we could really have a golden era if we play our cards right.
[01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:34.030]  It could be incredible.
[01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:37.030]  It could be incredibly golden, or three or four years from now,
[01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:40.030]  but it could be much darker than it was in 20 or 21
[01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:42.030]  with things that we can't even comprehend.
[01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:43.030]  That's the inflection point.
[01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:44.030]  Yeah.
[01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:45.030]  It's happening right now, Alex.
[01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:47.030]  It's important, which is why what you're doing is important.
[01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:49.030]  That's why we're putting this movie out now,
[01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:51.030]  just to remind people of what happened.
[01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:53.030]  It's only going to get more advanced in the future.
[01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:54.030]  Well, I'm glad you came on.
[01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:55.030]  I'm glad you came to Austin.
[01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:56.030]  You reached out.
[01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:58.030]  Of course, I'll meet you on any time you want,
[01:53:58.030 --> 01:54:00.030]  via Skype, Zoom, or when you're here in person.
[01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:01.030]  Tell us more about the movie.
[01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:03.030]  Where do we find it and bookmark it and promote it?
[01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:04.030]  Londonreal.tv?
[01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:06.030]  Is there a URL for the movie?
[01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:08.030]  With londonreal.tv forward slash movie,
[01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:11.030]  we are going to premiere it in London on July 28th.
[01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:12.030]  We have a big event.
[01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:14.030]  Then we're going to premiere it around the world in different cities,
[01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:16.030]  and we'll also have an online premiere afterwards
[01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:18.030]  for anyone who wants to support it.
[01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:20.030]  We're also going to be digitally distributing this.
[01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:22.030]  I'm going to bake it into the blockchain
[01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:24.030]  to where it can never be censored, ever,
[01:54:24.030 --> 01:54:25.030]  because I don't trust it, Alex.
[01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:28.030]  I do not trust it staying up there forever,
[01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:31.030]  and I want to make sure people can always watch this.
[01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:32.030]  Brian, you asked me,
[01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:35.030]  because we only talked like 30 seconds before we went live today,
[01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:36.030]  how I'm doing.
[01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:38.030]  I said, I've never been doing better.
[01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:39.030]  You basically said the same thing.
[01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:41.030]  It's the animating contest of liberty.
[01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:43.030]  We want people to know we're supposed to,
[01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:45.030]  and obviously you're in better shape than I, but it's a metaphor,
[01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:47.030]  lift weights, ride bikes.
[01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:49.030]  Once you do it, you get addicted to it.
[01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:50.030]  We've not been fighting tyranny.
[01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:52.030]  Once you do it, it's exciting.
[01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:55.030]  It's not like it's some horrible grind we're getting into.
[01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:58.030]  We're designed to promote free will and justice and freedom.
[01:54:58.030 --> 01:55:01.030]  It's been good guys and good girls, good ladies,
[01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:02.030]  that haven't been engaged,
[01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:04.030]  kind of leaving it to the establishment that have allowed this.
[01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:07.030]  I think the rediscovery of this animating contest that Thomas Jefferson
[01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:09.030]  talked about is exploding right now.
[01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:11.030]  And once people, as you said, figure it out,
[01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:14.030]  it's addictive to do the right thing.
[01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:15.030]  It's in ourselves.
[01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:18.030]  Yeah, and I love being part of the team that's on the right side of history.
[01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:21.030]  When I did that broadcast and you reached out, Alex,
[01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:23.030]  in addition to celebrities from all over the world
[01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:25.030]  and people and tons of influences,
[01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:26.030]  I said, Brian, we're with you 100%.
[01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:29.030]  I'm telling you, Alex, people want to be in this fight.
[01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:31.030]  It's what we're here for as humans,
[01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:33.030]  to protect what we value more than anything,
[01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:35.030]  and you are a huge part of that, Alex.
[01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:36.030]  I just want to say thank you.
[01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:39.030]  Well, here's the part of the fight club microcosm.
[01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:42.030]  Back three years ago when that was happening,
[01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:45.030]  I was saying to my producers, I want this guy on.
[01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:46.030]  He's awesome.
[01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:47.030]  He's doing these great interviews.
[01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:48.030]  Get him on the show.
[01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:49.030]  They're censoring him.
[01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:50.030]  We got to talk to him.
[01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:51.030]  And I walk in the house at night.
[01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:52.030]  My wife's cooking dinner.
[01:55:52.030 --> 01:55:54.030]  She's got the iPad on watching you and David.
[01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:55.030]  I like the censored deal.
[01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:57.030]  And obviously that's the synergy.
[01:55:57.030 --> 01:56:01.030]  And then I was, you know,
[01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:03.030]  the next day at a friend's house and they had it on.
[01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:05.030]  And then I think I told you about this.
[01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:08.030]  And then I was talking to Joe Rogan on the film,
[01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:09.030]  and he said, have you seen this?
[01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:12.030]  It was like, you love to see that zeitgeist happening.
[01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:14.030]  That's when you know you're over the target.
[01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:15.030]  Yeah, that's when you know.
[01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:16.030]  And people should sense out for those things
[01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:18.030]  and sense out like-minded people.
[01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:20.030]  And if this message is resonating with you at all,
[01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:21.030]  come join us.
[01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:23.030]  We need you out there spreading this information,
[01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:25.030]  talking about these important issues.
[01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:26.030]  It's crucial, and it's not hard.
[01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:29.030]  All we have to do is push back and say no.
[01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:30.030]  One minute left.
[01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:31.030]  Why are you living in Airstrip One?
[01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:33.030]  Why did you move to London?
[01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:35.030]  You know, I moved there 20 years ago,
[01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:36.030]  and it's been a beautiful thing.
[01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:38.030]  I feel like I'm an outpost out there.
[01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:39.030]  Speaking the truth, Alex, you know,
[01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:41.030]  I'm an American in London who's now a Brit.
[01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:44.030]  And I was in the right place at the right time
[01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:45.030]  to really put these messages out there.
[01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:47.030]  And I feel like I'm kind of an outpost
[01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:49.030]  for all the great work you're doing here in America
[01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:50.030]  and a lot of other people.
[01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:51.030]  So for me, that's home.
[01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:52.030]  I am London Real.
[01:56:52.030 --> 01:56:53.030]  London Real is me.
[01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:56.030]  And we're just going to keep pushing these messages out there.
[01:56:56.030 --> 01:57:00.030]  Where should they go to share the trailer?
[01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:01.030]  Because I want to share that trailer.
[01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:02.030]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:04.030]  We're going to have it up at londonreal.tv forward slash movie.
[01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:06.030]  I'm sure you're going to probably put it on band as well.
[01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:08.030]  Great. Guys, grab it and put it on band right now.
[01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:09.030]  Put it on the front page of Metforce.
[01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:10.030]  Beautiful, man.
[01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:11.030]  Brother, love you.
[01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:12.030]  Appreciate you too, sir.
[01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:14.030]  Thank you for coming on, and it's so exciting.
[01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:17.030]  You're taking us over the top, all of us together, brother.
[01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:18.030]  Let's do it, man. Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:19.030]  I appreciate you very much.
[01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:20.030]  I appreciate you.
[01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:22.030]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back.
[01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:24.030]  We have Luke Rakowski joining us.
[01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:25.030]  Talk about a smart guy.
[01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:26.030]  I've known this guy 18 years.
[01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:28.030]  He just gets smarter and smarter.
[01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:30.030]  We were on Tim Pool's podcast a few weeks ago, went viral.
[01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:32.030]  He just knocks it out of the park.
[01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:35.030]  Luke Radowski, Rakowski, Roofkowski.
[01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:36.030]  There's different ways of saying it.
[01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:37.030]  I'm going to ask him how he really says it.
[01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:38.030]  Because I have, like, Russians tell me this.
[01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:39.030]  Polish people tell me this.
[01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:40.030]  I've known him for 18 years.
[01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:42.030]  It's Luke Rakowski.
[01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:45.030]  But we're going to get the right way to pronounce his name too coming up.
[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:54.540]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:57.540]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:57:57.540 --> 01:57:59.540]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:02.540]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:05.540]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:07.540]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:13.540]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:16.540]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:19.540]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:24.540]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:27.540]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:30.540]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:33.540]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:35.540]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:40.540]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:42.540]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:43.540]  Go to infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:45.540]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air.
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:48.540]  And never submit to these tyrants.
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:53.540]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot.
[01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:55.540]  Because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.540]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:58:58.540]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:01.540]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:04.540]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:06.540]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:08.540]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:10.540]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:12.540]  Political prisoner.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.540]  With Trump on the front.
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:17.540]  There in a mugshot jail background.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:18.540]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:22.540]  It says infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:24.540]  We also have Alex Joves for president.
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:25.540]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:27.540]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:28.540]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:29.540]  Alex Joves for president.
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:30.540]  2024.
[01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:31.540]  It's a fun conversational piece.
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.540]  And a limited edition shirt.
[01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:34.540]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:43.540]  So get your Alex Joves for president and Trump mugshot shirts at infowarsstore.com
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:47.540]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:54.540]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:56.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:09.540]  Behind the scenes of the O'Biden crime empire,
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:12.540]  things can't be as smooth as they appear.
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:15.540]  What with the World War brewing on two fronts
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:19.540]  and a bid for the presidency when 70% of the country says no.
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:24.540]  In fact, the departure of domestic policy advisor Obama puppeteer Susan Rice
[02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:28.540]  reeks of a shift in Democratic support of Joe Biden.
[02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:32.540]  On top of it all, what had been on the back burner is now boiling over.
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:37.540]  As now, even Mockingbird Media is reporting on the massive sex trafficking
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:41.540]  and child labor violations surrounding the Mayorkas border time bomb.
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:42.540]  This is from the New York Times.
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:48.540]  Thousands of children have ended up in punishing jobs across the country,
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:52.540]  working overnight in slaughterhouses, replacing roofs,
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:58.540]  operating machinery in factories, all in violation of child labor laws.
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:03.540]  You come to office in 2021, huge surge, reports of trafficking, reports of neglect.
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:07.540]  Since the Fair Labor Standard Act of 1938,
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:11.540]  children under the age of 16 have been restricted from working
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:15.540]  under the conditions that Mayorkas is exponentially creating.
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:18.540]  You are failing miserably.
[02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:23.540]  Four to five million people, 1.4 million unknown gotaways.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:27.540]  We have no idea who those people are, what kind of security they risk.
[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:30.540]  You're not giving me any stats whatsoever
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:33.540]  in terms of the number of people that are human trafficked,
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:35.540]  how many young girls are sex trafficked.
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:37.540]  You don't have a clue.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:39.540]  You wouldn't even answer how many dead bodies,
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:42.540]  which is very well documented, at the border.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:44.540]  Do you not care?
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:47.540]  Do you not have just an ounce of human compassion
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:52.540]  for what your open border policy, the type of human depredations it is causing?
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:55.540]  You just sit there looking with a blank look on your face.
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:57.540]  So how bad is it?
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:07.540]  And I have seen the evidence of kids being reused to create a family unit.
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:10.540]  Same kid, same kid over and over again.
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:13.540]  Rent a kid. Not humane.
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:16.540]  It's not 90% going to parents anymore.
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:22.540]  It's a third or less going to parents in today's statistics and numbers.
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:25.540]  Now, Ms. Rodas, you've said that the U.S. government
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:31.540]  is the middleman in a multibillion dollar migrant child trafficking operation.
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:34.540]  What did you mean when you used the term middleman?
[02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:38.540]  So the United States government is receiving the children
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:43.540]  from the smugglers at the border.
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:47.540]  And HHS is a $2.7 trillion agency,
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:52.540]  and over the last two years has spent approximately $10 billion.
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:57.540]  So they are using that money to receive those children
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:03.540]  and then transport those children to the end user.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:09.540]  I was shocked and I am stunned that there is no one with law enforcement experience
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:12.540]  overseeing where children are going.
[02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:15.540]  You have people applying for children who we know
[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:19.540]  are members of transnational criminal organizations.
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:23.540]  Yet there's no one with any data analytics background
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:26.540]  or anything like that overseeing this operation.
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:32.540]  When one individual can sponsor 20 or 30 or 40 people
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:34.540]  and no one's asking a question about it,
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:38.540]  there's something seriously wrong and flawed with that program.
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:40.540]  The FBI releases him, they send him to Florida,
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:44.540]  he's over there hanging out with a fella, his sponsor.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:47.540]  Not a father, not a mother, just a sponsor.
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:49.540]  And what does he do?
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:52.540]  A few short months later, he kills him.
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:54.540]  He kills him.
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.540]  Now, I don't know what the protocol is down there,
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:58.540]  but when I look at this guy,
[02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:02.540]  he's got more chin whiskers than more 40-year-olds have.
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:04.540]  Look at that guy.
[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:08.540]  Would a guy like that get into this country as a minor?
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:11.540]  You said these kids are being recruited in their home country.
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:12.540]  What do you mean by that?
[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:14.540]  There's an example of a sponsor
[02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:17.540]  who currently is in Austin, Texas at this moment.
[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:20.540]  He attempted to sponsor four children,
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:23.540]  one from the Pomona Fairplex emergency intake site
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:26.540]  and three from the Pecos emergency intake site,
[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:29.540]  promising work to these children
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:32.540]  who are making $2.50 a day on the coffee farm
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:34.540]  he owns in Guatemala.
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:36.540]  So he lured them here.
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:38.540]  The Department of Homeland Security
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:41.540]  has transnational criminal organizations
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:43.540]  on the top watch list,
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:47.540]  some of who got their fingerprints here in Washington, D.C.,
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:50.540]  in neighboring areas, are sponsoring the children.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:51.540]  It's indisputable.
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.540]  So the money goes to the trafficker
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:55.540]  who ultimately brings them here.
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:58.540]  The New York Times actually showed, I think...
[02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:01.540]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months,
[02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:03.540]  and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:05.540]  We made it even stronger.
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:09.540]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:13.540]  TurboForce is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:16.540]  or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:20.540]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs
[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:22.540]  that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:24.540]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:26.540]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals
[02:05:26.540 --> 02:05:29.540]  and a bunch of other key things in amino acids
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:31.540]  that turbocharge everything
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:35.540]  and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:38.540]  It is the super fuel.
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:40.540]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:41.540]  RainForce Alt is great.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:42.540]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:43.540]  They go good with this.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:46.540]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.540]  This is the boss.
[02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:50.540]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted,
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:52.540]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:55.540]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:00.540]  Big Brother.
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:03.540]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:06.540]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:08.540]  You want answers?
[02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:10.540]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:13.540]  Live from Austin, Texas,
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:15.540]  broadcasting worldwide,
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:18.540]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:21.540]  We are now in the hour number four.
[02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:24.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:27.540]  We are now in the hour number three on this live,
[02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:29.540]  April 27th, Thursday, transmission.
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:31.540]  My old friend, I've known him over 18 years,
[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:33.540]  Luke Berdowski, joins us now.
[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.540]  The founder of WeAreChange, WeAreChange.com.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:39.540]  And of course, a popular podcast from where he was here a few weeks ago
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:42.540]  with some big panels that went viral.
[02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:44.540]  And I like the fact that he raised on the panel
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:46.540]  not just the congressional hearings and the spying going on
[02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:48.540]  and the surveillance and the censorship,
[02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:50.540]  but the giant human trafficking.
[02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:52.540]  And that dam is breaking.
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:55.540]  Congressional hearings, 20-plus thousand pedophiles released,
[02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:59.540]  hundreds of thousands of children smuggled through every few months,
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:02.540]  being given to pedophiles in many cases, human smugglers.
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:04.540]  It's all coming down.
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:07.540]  So I haven't talked to Luke since last week when I went on the show,
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:09.540]  and there's so much to cover.
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:11.540]  I want to hit Tucker Carlson first, the Ukraine situation,
[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:14.540]  the economy, the central bank digital currencies,
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:16.540]  the human trafficking.
[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:18.540]  Luke Berdowski, great to have you on.
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:20.540]  What do you want to plunge into first?
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:23.540]  Well, thank you so much for having me on.
[02:07:23.540 --> 02:07:25.540]  There's a lot of different things going on
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:27.540]  that I think are extremely important to talk about
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:32.540]  since so many of these topics are just ignored, not talked about, shunned over.
[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:35.540]  And I think the topic that you brought up recently,
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:37.540]  especially with the child traffickers out there,
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:40.540]  is important, especially what happened with Tucker Carlson.
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:42.540]  A lot of people don't know this,
[02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:44.540]  but just a few days ago when he was still on Fox News,
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:48.540]  he directly was talking about his own investigation,
[02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:50.540]  reaching out to the DOJ,
[02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:54.540]  specifically asking them about their ongoing Epstein investigation,
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:58.540]  which the DOJ was supposed to respond to him to.
[02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:01.540]  Then a couple days later, Tucker Carlson is, of course, taken off air.
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.540]  And that investigation, I'm still waiting.
[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:06.540]  There's an ongoing investigation to what happened to Epstein,
[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:08.540]  investigated by the DOJ.
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:11.540]  That investigation we have heard nothing about.
[02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:13.540]  And the only person on national television,
[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:15.540]  the only person in our media sphere
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:18.540]  that has ever officially reached out to the DOJ about this,
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:21.540]  has been canned, has been taken off air.
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:24.540]  So I think a lot of people need to correlate those two stories
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:26.540]  because I think that has a lot more to do with it,
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:28.540]  especially when it comes to Big Pharma,
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:30.540]  especially when it comes to the military-industrial complex,
[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:33.540]  especially when it comes to the larger intelligentsia state
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.540]  that is absolutely allergic to any accountability,
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:38.540]  to any criticism.
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:39.540]  And I think more than ever,
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:43.540]  we need to be speaking about these issues more louder than ever.
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:44.540]  I totally agree.
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:46.540]  And I had Roger Stone on yesterday,
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:49.540]  who's good friends with Tucker as I am and many others,
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:54.540]  but he said Tucker was banned for what they were fearing he was about to say.
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:56.540]  It was everything he'd said before,
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:59.540]  the fact that they couldn't control him, that's why they did it.
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:02.540]  Tucker was let go because they realized he was being too effective.
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:04.540]  They thought, so what if we have a popular Fox show
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:06.540]  talking about the New World Order?
[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:09.540]  But because they're losing, they're doing desperate things,
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:13.540]  which now, I mean, he had more views on that video he put out last night
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:16.540]  than all the cable networks this week will have combined.
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:18.540]  That has really got to freak the system out, Luke.
[02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:22.540]  Yeah, the Fox News ratings, they're crashing.
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:24.540]  I mean, there's a poll right now that I just released right now
[02:09:24.540 --> 02:09:28.540]  showing that the numbers, that they lost nearly 50% of total viewers
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:33.540]  and nearly 70% of viewers in the key demo last Tuesday alone.
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:34.540]  And there's no going back from this
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:37.540]  because why else would people be watching cable news?
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:40.540]  The only reason was, hey, there's this one guy actually willing
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.540]  to kind of challenge ideas.
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.540]  There's this one guy who's actually willing to even go as far
[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:46.540]  as to criticize Donald Trump.
[02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:49.540]  There's one guy willing to actually do his job as a journalist,
[02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:51.540]  and that person, of course, was taken down.
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:53.540]  And this is not something that is new.
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:55.540]  This has been happening for a very long time.
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:58.540]  They have blue doves on CNN and others, exactly,
[02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:01.540]  but as soon as they get too big and are too effective, they're taken off.
[02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:03.540]  Exactly, they're a lure to get the audience,
[02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:06.540]  but when they become too effective, they've got to be gotten rid of.
[02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:07.540]  Blue doves is one of them.
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:09.540]  Phil Donahue is another individual.
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:10.540]  So is Jesse Ventura.
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:12.540]  He was put in golden handcuffs.
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:15.540]  James O'Keefe was taken down just a few weeks ago himself.
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:19.540]  So there's a long history of very powerful institutions,
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:22.540]  very powerful individuals, and Tucker keeps calling them
[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:24.540]  hysterical and aggressive people in charge,
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:27.540]  and I absolutely agree with him on that assessment,
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.540]  that take down anyone that largely is anti-war,
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:32.540]  that stands in the way of the war machine,
[02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:34.540]  that stands in the way of the propaganda,
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:37.540]  because they know how effective speaking the truth is.
[02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:39.540]  I wouldn't be doing this for over 20 plus years
[02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:43.540]  if I didn't believe in the powerful message of truth,
[02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:44.540]  of being able to speak truth,
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:46.540]  the power of being able to confront individuals,
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:48.540]  of being able to share information with individuals
[02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:51.540]  that they can then later take into their own lives
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:53.540]  and make better decisions for themselves.
[02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:55.540]  Well, Luke, what do you think Rupert Murdoch
[02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:57.540]  and the New World Order are thinking right now
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:00.540]  when this Tucker video from last night shot from his house,
[02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:01.540]  you know, hundreds of millions of views?
[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:04.540]  I mean, it's got to scare the hell out of them.
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:05.540]  Exactly, and I think it is,
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:08.540]  and I think this is why kind of Tucker highlighted,
[02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:09.540]  hey, see you soon.
[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:10.540]  What does he mean by that?
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:12.540]  Allegedly, according to the sources,
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:14.540]  people don't even know why Tucker was kind of taken down.
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:17.540]  Tucker allegedly doesn't even know why Tucker was taken down
[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:19.540]  from all the sources that we're kind of reading online.
[02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:21.540]  Who really knows what's happening behind the scenes?
[02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:23.540]  But the fact that we still do not have an official explanation,
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:26.540]  the fact that we're still kind of guessing here
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:27.540]  what really happened here.
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:28.540]  Well, it's because they have nothing.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.540]  It's because of his message.
[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:30.540]  He was taken out because of the message.
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:33.540]  Even this woman producer suing him, he never met her.
[02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:36.540]  Yeah, they never met in real life,
[02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:39.540]  and she's out there on all the MSNBC shows.
[02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:43.540]  She's out there hysterically talking about all these microaggressions
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:45.540]  and all these other things that, again,
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:49.540]  actually play no reality in everyday American lives
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:51.540]  where they're like, this doesn't really matter.
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:52.540]  Who really cares about this?
[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:54.540]  A lot of people are saying it's because of that lawsuit.
[02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:56.540]  A lot of people are saying it's because of the Dominion lawsuit.
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:57.540]  This doesn't add up at all.
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:59.540]  No, it's because he was anti-globalist, anti-war,
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:01.540]  and coming out against the poison shots.
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:02.540]  We know why it happened.
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:04.540]  But, yeah, no, I mean, I can tell you,
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:07.540]  Tucker's been kicking the tires and knowing this was probably coming,
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:09.540]  so he'll be back very, very soon.
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:10.540]  He's already back.
[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:12.540]  I mean, one two-minute, 15-second clip,
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:14.540]  hundreds of millions of views.
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:15.540]  Wow.
[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:19.540]  Yes, there's also talks about him allegedly being under an 18-month contract
[02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:22.540]  and Fox News allegedly giving him golden handcuffs,
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:25.540]  just like they did in Jesse Ventura when he came out against the Iraq War.
[02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:28.540]  And he wouldn't cow down to the military-industrial complex.
[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:30.540]  There's a possibility that they could do that,
[02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:32.540]  but we'll see how this plays out.
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:34.540]  But if they get the silence, Tucker Carlson,
[02:12:34.540 --> 02:12:37.540]  for the next 18 months for the next presidential election cycle,
[02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:40.540]  holy cow will that have a huge effect on the American people.
[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:41.540]  You're right.
[02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:42.540]  The question is, is there golden handcuffs?
[02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:44.540]  Because I don't know what's in the contract.
[02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:45.540]  Yeah.
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:47.540]  So what I'm seeing and what I'm reading online,
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:53.540]  allegedly he's getting paid, you know, I think $10.5 million a month
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:55.540]  and that he still has an ongoing contract
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:59.540]  that is going to keep him there at Fox News for another 18 months.
[02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:02.540]  So allegedly he's been kicked out of his emails.
[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:04.540]  He's been told not to do a show.
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:08.540]  His producer was also kind of kicked out of all the responsibilities they had here.
[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:11.540]  That's what we're hearing so far.
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:13.540]  And if this is an attempt for Fox News to say,
[02:13:13.540 --> 02:13:15.540]  hey, we're going to lose hundreds of millions of dollars,
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:20.540]  but, hey, we're going to make sure that we comply with Big Pharma,
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:22.540]  that we comply with the military-industrial complex
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:25.540]  because Fox News is also under a lot of pressure.
[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:27.540]  Remember what Schumer said.
[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:31.540]  He said we'll take out Fox if they don't do what we want a month ago.
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:32.540]  Exactly.
[02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:35.540]  And when you look at all these lawsuits piling up,
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:36.540]  especially with the federal government,
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:39.540]  especially with AOC coming on national television
[02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:43.540]  and saying that Tucker Carlson is a threat, he needs to be censored,
[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:46.540]  needs to be taken down by government action,
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:48.540]  all of this kind of lines up.
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:51.540]  And one day later, he's off the air.
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:52.540]  Exactly.
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:53.540]  And it makes sense.
[02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:55.540]  And also at that same time, it wasn't just AOC.
[02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:58.540]  It was also Ray Epps that came out on national television
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:01.540]  and also came out against Tucker Carlson,
[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:05.540]  specifically saying that he also is inciting violence, that he's dangerous.
[02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:10.540]  So they came out with the talking points the day before making this big decision
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:11.540]  because this is a huge decision.
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:14.540]  This is Fox News essentially shooting themselves in the foot.
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:16.540]  This is Fox News essentially canceling themselves,
[02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:17.540]  destroying their livelihood,
[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:22.540]  destroying any kind of ability of people even being able to watch them from now on
[02:14:22.540 --> 02:14:24.540]  because who else is going to be watching them?
[02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:27.540]  The older kind of boomer demographics that are slowly
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:30.540]  and surely disappearing into the wayside.
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.540]  People want the truth.
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:33.540]  People are hungry for the truth.
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:36.540]  Tucker, again, I disagreed with him on some kind of assessments,
[02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:38.540]  on some kind of his opinions,
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:44.540]  but he was the closest to at least having a fair and honest conversation in this country,
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:47.540]  and that's more than almost anyone else in the corporate media is doing right now.
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:51.540]  That's just regurgitating all the talking points of the establishment.
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:55.540]  That's regurgitating all the larger psyopsis that they're running on everyone
[02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:59.540]  that is meant to fulfill a larger depopulation agenda,
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:04.540]  a larger agenda that is unhuman, that is essentially serving their death cult.
[02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:05.540]  I agree.
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:07.540]  We're going to break here in a moment, but when we come back,
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:09.540]  you're really a smart guy that I respect.
[02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:11.540]  It's been a fight a long time.
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:13.540]  How is it going for the new world order?
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:15.540]  Start giving us a prelude.
[02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:20.540]  So the way I see them kind of operating is two step forwards, one step back.
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:22.540]  They're moving forward a lot.
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:24.540]  When we look at what's happening with Ukraine,
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:27.540]  with so many innocent human beings losing their lives there,
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:30.540]  when we look at what's happening with big pharma consolidating a lot of their profits,
[02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:33.540]  when we look at the threats that they're making, yes, they're winning.
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:36.540]  They do take a step back sometimes, but they're very strategic in how they operate
[02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:38.540]  and how they move forward.
[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:41.540]  Now, the most confusing move for me to understand here,
[02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:44.540]  because I could see how the chess game is played out here,
[02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:47.540]  but they're still putting Joe Biden up front,
[02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:51.540]  and I think he's going to be a sacrificed pawn in the larger game that's being played here
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:53.540]  because clearly he's not all there.
[02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:55.540]  I agree. Stay there. Let's talk about the election.
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:16:04.260]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:08.260]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:13.260]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:17.260]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:22.260]  And when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:26.260]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:30.260]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:36.260]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:39.260]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[02:16:39.260 --> 02:16:43.260]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[02:16:43.260 --> 02:16:48.260]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:52.260]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:57.260]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:16:57.260 --> 02:16:59.260]  Please take action now.
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:02.260]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:04.260]  This is their big move.
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:08.260]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:11.260]  He doesn't care. That's not his job.
[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:16.260]  He's not the president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:21.260]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:23.260]  They must be opposed.
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:26.260]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:29.260]  No, no, no.
[02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:33.260]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:36.260]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:39.260]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:41.260]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:45.260]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:47.260]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:51.260]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:55.260]  And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:02.260]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:09.260]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:13.260]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:16.260]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:20.260]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:22.260]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:26.260]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:30.260]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:34.260]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:37.260]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second.
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:40.260]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:43.260]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:46.260]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:48.260]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:51.260]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:05.260]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:08.260]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:16.260]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:19.260]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:22.260]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:25.260]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:30.260]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:33.260]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:40.260]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:42.260]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:47.260]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:51.260]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:53.260]  And a remedy to this madness.
[02:19:53.260 --> 02:19:57.260]  Available now at InfoWarStore.com
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:03.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:05.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.730 --> 02:20:15.410]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Show, Thursday edition, wearechanged.com is the great website
[02:20:15.410 --> 02:20:16.410]  of Luke Berkowski.
[02:20:16.410 --> 02:20:20.250]  Luke, there's so many points to hit, I've got so many questions, let me do a little bit
[02:20:20.250 --> 02:20:21.250]  of housekeeping here.
[02:20:21.250 --> 02:20:24.730]  I'm not mad at these folks, we just get a lot of calls from the media and a lot of emails.
[02:20:24.730 --> 02:20:30.689]  We'll put it on screen, no, I have not been let back on Twitter, there are a lot of accounts
[02:20:30.689 --> 02:20:34.410]  out there that say they're Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.410 --> 02:20:40.650]  And so real A Jones with a Z is not me, but I like the stuff they're saying they're doing,
[02:20:40.650 --> 02:20:45.090]  but they admit on the site, not the real Alex Jones.
[02:20:45.090 --> 02:20:50.130]  So everybody else out there that is not me, I've been not let back on Twitter, though
[02:20:50.130 --> 02:20:53.490]  I've noticed our videos are going more viral than ever, and they're not being censored
[02:20:53.490 --> 02:20:54.490]  like they were.
[02:20:54.490 --> 02:21:03.529]  So Luke, again, the view from space here beyond 35,000 feet, the view from 200,000 feet, how's
[02:21:03.529 --> 02:21:05.650]  it going for the new world order?
[02:21:05.650 --> 02:21:07.970]  Where do you see them going?
[02:21:07.970 --> 02:21:10.770]  The whole world's turning against them, it seems, but they never give up.
[02:21:10.770 --> 02:21:16.090]  I'm really worried about power outages, hack attacks, cyber attacks, expanding war with
[02:21:16.090 --> 02:21:19.730]  Russia, China going into Taiwan.
[02:21:19.730 --> 02:21:24.529]  On your geopolitical radar screen, yeah, we're doing well, but how would you describe the
[02:21:24.529 --> 02:21:26.090]  lay of the land right now?
[02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:30.930]  Well, you know, the war in Ukraine is meant to be prolonged, not to be won.
[02:21:30.930 --> 02:21:35.850]  And when you look at the Americans' decisions when it comes to arming and giving them weapons
[02:21:35.850 --> 02:21:40.449]  and all this latest technology, it's always enough just to make sure that they just fight
[02:21:40.449 --> 02:21:43.710]  a little bit longer, and a little bit longer, to the point where they're actually running
[02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:45.529]  out of people now.
[02:21:45.529 --> 02:21:49.210]  And it's a horrible, horrible situation unfolding in that country right now.
[02:21:49.210 --> 02:21:53.090]  But when you kind of scan back here, there's a lot of different things at play here.
[02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:58.890]  For me personally, I do believe the financial picture is the one worth looking into, especially
[02:21:58.890 --> 02:22:01.050]  when it comes to central bank digital currencies.
[02:22:01.050 --> 02:22:05.050]  I think they try different things and they kind of move on to the next things in order
[02:22:05.050 --> 02:22:09.689]  to shock people, because obviously we had 9-11, obviously we had the financial banking
[02:22:09.689 --> 02:22:14.689]  crisis in 2008, obviously we had COVID and that larger kind of psyops that played out
[02:22:14.689 --> 02:22:17.050]  against the American people and the people of the world.
[02:22:17.050 --> 02:22:18.650]  Now what's the latest thing?
[02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:24.850]  I think geopolitically, there's a big component to this proxy war escalating and continuing
[02:22:24.850 --> 02:22:26.810]  on for a very long time.
[02:22:26.810 --> 02:22:28.130]  Conflicts are very easy to start.
[02:22:28.369 --> 02:22:30.689]  They're very hard to stop.
[02:22:30.689 --> 02:22:34.890]  And when you look at, you know, a lot of the sectarian conflicts, which the conflict in
[02:22:34.890 --> 02:22:38.170]  Ukraine is, Ukraine is like the Afghanistan of Europe.
[02:22:38.170 --> 02:22:39.430]  There's a lot of bloodshed there.
[02:22:39.430 --> 02:22:40.890]  There's a lot of history there.
[02:22:40.890 --> 02:22:45.330]  There's a lot of turmoil and war that unfolded in that specific region.
[02:22:45.330 --> 02:22:48.930]  And once that conflict started, I knew this was going to be continuing for a very long
[02:22:48.930 --> 02:22:49.930]  time.
[02:22:49.930 --> 02:22:51.810]  CNN was saying, oh, this is only going to last a week.
[02:22:51.810 --> 02:22:55.550]  I was like, no, this could last years, this could last decades.
[02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:59.990]  And if we look at what's even happening in the Middle East, these conflicts don't go away.
[02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:01.910]  They're going to be continuing for a very long time.
[02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:02.910]  And I think that's what they want.
[02:23:02.910 --> 02:23:04.910]  They want this kind of larger instability.
[02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:07.630]  They want that larger threat against everyone else.
[02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:11.710]  They want the cards stacked against everyone else with the larger austerity measures that
[02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:16.369]  are being pushed because the war in Ukraine, as long as it's prolonged, achieves a number
[02:23:16.369 --> 02:23:20.410]  of different things, specifically when it comes to denying poor people energy.
[02:23:20.410 --> 02:23:21.470]  That's great.
[02:23:21.470 --> 02:23:22.470]  That's perfect for them.
[02:23:22.470 --> 02:23:24.230]  Destroying poor people in the middle class.
[02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:25.590]  That's what they've been doing.
[02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:27.689]  The war in Ukraine helps accelerate that.
[02:23:27.689 --> 02:23:33.029]  When it comes to starving people, war in Ukraine, also really great for that since, of course,
[02:23:33.029 --> 02:23:35.150]  Ukraine is a major food exporter.
[02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:40.949]  And a lot of those exports were stopped in very significant ways, which also have a larger
[02:23:40.949 --> 02:23:43.070]  negative impact on everyone else in the world.
[02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:47.310]  So when you look at what's really benefiting them, it's really the tighter squeeze.
[02:23:47.310 --> 02:23:51.710]  And when we look at Biden's new moves, when it comes to mortgages here in the United States,
[02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:55.710]  essentially setting up a form of soft communism on everyone, making people with good credit
[02:23:55.710 --> 02:24:00.410]  pay more, making people with bad credit be incentivized to have bad credit.
[02:24:00.410 --> 02:24:05.430]  When you look at these larger moves, I do see the financial perspectives being far more
[02:24:05.430 --> 02:24:07.029]  relevant than anything else.
[02:24:07.029 --> 02:24:10.150]  Now, we have other people threatening that there's going to be another bioweapon.
[02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:16.990]  I don't see it as likely as the bigger likelihood of infrastructure attacks, digital attacks,
[02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:21.230]  cyber 9-11s, which we know the World Economic Forum and many other Davos elites have been
[02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:22.310]  working towards.
[02:24:22.310 --> 02:24:27.590]  So I do see infrastructure and the economy being the two major points, as the war in Ukraine
[02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:31.910]  is still going to be continuing on for a very long time, as the major problems ahead for
[02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:34.430]  humanity that we are going to have to deal with.
[02:24:34.430 --> 02:24:39.470]  Because when you have a destruction of the American currency, of the U.S. petrol dollar,
[02:24:39.470 --> 02:24:43.590]  as deliberately as it's happening right now, you're going to have a lot of really negative
[02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:44.590]  effects.
[02:24:44.590 --> 02:24:48.670]  All of this was kind of accelerated during COVID, especially when the lockdowns were
[02:24:48.670 --> 02:24:51.390]  started under the Trump administration.
[02:24:51.390 --> 02:24:55.990]  And I think this larger cascading effect of destroying people financially is going to
[02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:59.949]  continue to a crescendo moment where things just blow up.
[02:24:59.949 --> 02:25:00.949]  Infrastructure attacks.
[02:25:00.949 --> 02:25:01.949]  Who's responsible?
[02:25:01.949 --> 02:25:02.949]  No, I agree.
[02:25:02.949 --> 02:25:04.550]  They use the wars and all that as the excuse for what happened.
[02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:07.910]  Well, I mean, take the State Department on record last year.
[02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:13.310]  They're on record getting Bolsonaro out and putting in Lula, who then immediately runs
[02:25:13.310 --> 02:25:16.550]  to China and says, we're going off the dollar to your currency.
[02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:18.710]  So the State Department knew what they were doing.
[02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:22.590]  Why are they the slow decline of the American currency?
[02:25:22.590 --> 02:25:27.710]  Why would they take the most powerful thing America has and then do this Ukraine war and
[02:25:27.710 --> 02:25:32.869]  push everybody into bricks and push Russia into a merger with China?
[02:25:32.869 --> 02:25:34.029]  These people aren't American.
[02:25:34.029 --> 02:25:36.430]  These people do not care about America.
[02:25:36.430 --> 02:25:39.949]  America is just a tool for them, essentially.
[02:25:39.949 --> 02:25:43.710]  When you look at a lot of these larger billionaires, especially the types of Bill Gates, there's
[02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:46.109]  a reason that they do a lot of business with China.
[02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:50.830]  Some of the latest nuclear technological developments are being developed between Bill Gates and
[02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:51.830]  China right now.
[02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:55.750]  There's a reason Bill Gates is helping out the Chinese military because the system that
[02:25:55.750 --> 02:26:01.430]  they want to implement globally is essentially the Chinese social credit score system, a
[02:26:01.430 --> 02:26:06.510]  system that tracks databases, punishes you and prevents you from being able to buy train
[02:26:06.510 --> 02:26:12.270]  tickets because you defaulted on your loan or you didn't say the right thing or you jaywalked
[02:26:12.270 --> 02:26:15.990]  or you sneezed in the wrong public train car.
[02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:21.109]  So that's the system that they're trying to unfold here is the system that they've been
[02:26:21.109 --> 02:26:25.830]  testing in China for a very long time to see how people will comply.
[02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:29.109]  And essentially, they want that system everywhere in the entire world.
[02:26:29.109 --> 02:26:33.430]  What better way to do that than to get rid of the number one thing standing in their way?
[02:26:33.430 --> 02:26:39.270]  And that, of course, is the financial sustainability of human beings, capitalism, free flow of
[02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:42.070]  money and markets that solve a lot of government problems.
[02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:43.350]  And the second thing is family.
[02:26:43.350 --> 02:26:44.750]  There's been a huge attack on the family.
[02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:49.470]  There's been huge attacks on individuals being able to reproduce and actually have babies
[02:26:49.470 --> 02:26:53.670]  because this actually goes into a deeper agenda of them, of them setting up a Chinese social
[02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:58.710]  credit score, technocratic nightmare, them living forever while the plebs that are useless,
[02:26:58.710 --> 02:27:03.230]  according to Yoel Harari, who even admits this, are going to be, of course, pacified
[02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:04.630]  with drugs and video games.
[02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:08.910]  So in the longer perspective, in the longer picture, that's how I see everything unfolding.
[02:27:08.910 --> 02:27:10.390]  And these people are very deliberate.
[02:27:10.390 --> 02:27:11.390]  They're very smart.
[02:27:11.390 --> 02:27:15.230]  Two steps forward, one step back is usually the goals that they're doing.
[02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:19.710]  And I see eventually in the near future a cyber 9-11 financial crash.
[02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:20.710]  Is it Russia?
[02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:21.710]  Is it China?
[02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:22.710]  Who knows?
[02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:23.710]  Plausible deniability.
[02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:27.430]  But Russia in the picture here with this conflict being still going on in Ukraine, that's how
[02:27:27.430 --> 02:27:29.830]  I see it kind of moving forward from here.
[02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:34.789]  But it also depends on who is going to be the next president of the United States.
[02:27:34.789 --> 02:27:36.510]  And that is still up in the air.
[02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:39.470]  And that's what we hit before the segment ended last segment.
[02:27:39.470 --> 02:27:40.470]  Let's start getting into that.
[02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:41.550]  We'll get into the next segment.
[02:27:41.550 --> 02:27:43.590]  You're saying Biden's a sacrificial lamb.
[02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:45.189]  Give us your view on that.
[02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:50.270]  Yeah, I mean, Nikki Haley came out today and talked about how he is probably not going to
[02:27:50.270 --> 02:27:52.430]  live for the next five years.
[02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:54.869]  And I don't care how many puppets of him they have.
[02:27:54.869 --> 02:27:59.869]  They could only have this facade for so long as, of course, a lot of people are seeing
[02:27:59.869 --> 02:28:01.270]  that the emperor has no clothes.
[02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:05.510]  A lot of people are saying, hey, this guy who could barely make a coherent statement,
[02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:07.189]  he's making all the tough decisions here.
[02:28:07.189 --> 02:28:09.430]  No, someone else is behind the scenes.
[02:28:09.430 --> 02:28:13.910]  And in one way, Biden is the perfect candidate because, again, he sits down, they give him
[02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:18.590]  a Fisher Price kind of Oval Office, he presses buttons, but they don't really do anything.
[02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:20.550]  And there's a bureaucracy behind him.
[02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:24.750]  There's the guys with suits behind him that are truly calling the shots.
[02:28:24.750 --> 02:28:28.189]  And when you look at the Biden presidency, it is the presidency that they're using him
[02:28:28.189 --> 02:28:33.470]  as a scapegoat to push forward all of their extremely unpopular policies on and blame
[02:28:33.470 --> 02:28:39.430]  him on personally for those very horrible moves that really do hurt the American people,
[02:28:39.430 --> 02:28:41.470]  no matter if they're on the left or right.
[02:28:41.470 --> 02:28:42.470]  Everyone is hurting.
[02:28:42.470 --> 02:28:43.789]  They're going to be hurting a lot more.
[02:28:43.789 --> 02:28:45.630]  He's extremely unpopular.
[02:28:45.630 --> 02:28:48.470]  And they're still going for Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[02:28:48.470 --> 02:28:50.470]  They all are promoting Biden.
[02:28:50.470 --> 02:28:51.470]  They did.
[02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:52.470]  No, I agree.
[02:28:52.470 --> 02:28:58.670]  So let's talk about how that unfolds and how we stop it with Luke Rudowsky straight ahead.
[02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:03.430]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:29:03.430 --> 02:29:05.590]  We made it even stronger.
[02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:11.150]  The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere, Turbo Force is back in stock
[02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:16.230]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:22.750]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours, should be
[02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:24.390]  called 10 hour energy.
[02:29:24.390 --> 02:29:29.830]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:34.990]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:35.990]  it.
[02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:39.390]  It is the super fuel.
[02:29:39.390 --> 02:29:40.869]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[02:29:40.869 --> 02:29:41.869]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[02:29:41.869 --> 02:29:42.869]  There are two different nootropics.
[02:29:42.869 --> 02:29:43.869]  They go good with this.
[02:29:43.869 --> 02:29:46.750]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:29:46.750 --> 02:29:48.150]  This is the boss.
[02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:50.949]  Turbo Force back in stock, discounted.

[02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:47.550]  having these products.
[02:30:47.550 --> 02:30:48.550]  So get off the bench.
[02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:49.550]  Get in the game.

[02:31:17.189 --> 02:31:22.670]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know, I don't know, Alex
[02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:26.150]  and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:31.710]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything, krill oil.
[02:31:31.710 --> 02:31:37.869]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[02:31:37.869 --> 02:31:39.470]  that will keep you alive.
[02:31:39.470 --> 02:31:43.390]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[02:31:43.390 --> 02:31:45.949]  supplements, but the day will come.
[02:31:45.949 --> 02:31:49.750]  Potassium, zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold DNA force.
[02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:50.750]  Absolutely.
[02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:51.750]  Mineral fusion.
[02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:52.750]  Absolutely.
[02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:55.630]  As you're drinking filter water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:58.270]  You have to have these products.
[02:31:58.270 --> 02:32:02.630]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like
[02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:06.510]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:07.630]  addicts and criminals.
[02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:10.869]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[02:32:10.869 --> 02:32:12.670]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:14.510]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:15.510]  No.
[02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:17.510]  I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:19.070]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:21.869]  And again, I, you know, I have info words to thank for that.
[02:32:21.869 --> 02:32:25.949]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:32:25.949 --> 02:32:30.550]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and
[02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:31.710]  under the InfoWars team.
[02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:37.390]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips because
[02:32:37.390 --> 02:32:42.150]  Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media
[02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:43.150]  refuses to.
[02:32:43.390 --> 02:32:47.510]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and
[02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:49.270]  helping the American people.
[02:32:49.270 --> 02:32:52.949]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on
[02:32:52.949 --> 02:32:53.949]  in my career.
[02:32:58.949 --> 02:33:05.230]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.730 --> 02:33:22.770]  Please remember, listeners, the only way we get out of the fandom zone, the censorship
[02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:27.330]  bubble, is for you to take articles and videos from InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and Bandai
[02:33:27.330 --> 02:33:29.689]  Video and to share them.
[02:33:29.689 --> 02:33:30.689]  And people are doing it.
[02:33:30.689 --> 02:33:32.289]  I want to commend you and thank you.
[02:33:32.289 --> 02:33:33.529]  Also we've got great supplements.

[02:33:39.490 --> 02:33:40.490]  It's amazing.

[02:33:44.770 --> 02:33:48.050]  that boost all your natural hormones and just does amazing things.

[02:33:50.289 --> 02:33:52.810]  It's 40% off even though it's selling out.
[02:33:52.810 --> 02:33:53.810]  InfoWars.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:33:53.810 --> 02:33:58.130]  I want to thank all of you that have kept us on air.
[02:33:58.130 --> 02:34:01.410]  I want to encourage those that have been on the fence to go to InfoWars.com and get some
[02:34:01.410 --> 02:34:02.410]  Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:34:02.410 --> 02:34:03.410]  Highest Grade Krill Oil.
[02:34:03.410 --> 02:34:06.130]  Get some of the other great products there.
[02:34:06.130 --> 02:34:09.449]  Get a Trump Political Prisoner Mugshot shirt.
[02:34:09.449 --> 02:34:11.369]  Get an Alex Jones for President shirt.
[02:34:11.369 --> 02:34:13.330]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:34:13.330 --> 02:34:14.330]  That's how we stay on air.
[02:34:14.330 --> 02:34:19.170]  And with the great products from InfoWars Platinum that are private label of some already
[02:34:19.170 --> 02:34:25.210]  best-selling products nationwide that are tested, loved, 1776 Testosterone Boost, 1776
[02:34:25.210 --> 02:34:28.090]  Testosterone Boost and PainMD for pain management.
[02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:29.090]  All right.
[02:34:29.090 --> 02:34:30.090]  Back to Luke Rodowski.
[02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:35.010]  I can ask, again, a million questions and I've got a million questions, but what else
[02:34:35.010 --> 02:34:36.410]  are you really focused on?
[02:34:36.410 --> 02:34:38.770]  What are you most concerned about right now?
[02:34:38.770 --> 02:34:42.730]  We started getting into Biden earlier and you talk about a sacrificial lamb.
[02:34:42.730 --> 02:34:45.210]  He gets the blame for all the tyranny.
[02:34:45.210 --> 02:34:47.010]  I'm worried they might assassinate him.
[02:34:47.010 --> 02:34:48.170]  People say, well, they'll just put Kamala in.
[02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:49.689]  Well, who knows?
[02:34:49.689 --> 02:34:53.930]  What do you think, because you're a deep researcher, they're planning with the next election a
[02:34:53.930 --> 02:34:55.689]  year and a half away?
[02:34:55.689 --> 02:34:59.250]  I think we have to understand that there's an illusion of choice.
[02:34:59.410 --> 02:35:00.810]  The left and right are compromised.
[02:35:00.810 --> 02:35:02.369]  No one is coming to save you.
[02:35:02.369 --> 02:35:06.890]  You have to save yourself by making very smart decisions for yourself as an individual.
[02:35:06.890 --> 02:35:10.369]  But when it comes to the political landscape, let's go over through some of the candidates
[02:35:10.369 --> 02:35:13.570]  here because they all have their pros and they all have their cons.
[02:35:13.570 --> 02:35:17.490]  And I think it's important kind of analyzing everything from a fair and honest perspective
[02:35:17.490 --> 02:35:19.609]  because a lot of people have a lot of blinders on.
[02:35:19.609 --> 02:35:21.369]  They only want to see what they wanted to see.
[02:35:21.369 --> 02:35:25.689]  And I think it's important to explore into the deeper ends of who people really are, their
[02:35:25.689 --> 02:35:28.770]  records and how things are going to be moving forward.
[02:35:28.770 --> 02:35:30.609]  Because there's obviously Ron DeSantis.
[02:35:30.609 --> 02:35:33.170]  I think he hangs out with Jeb Bush way too much.
[02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:37.289]  I don't think he's politically smart for attacking Trump at the peak of his indictment.
[02:35:37.289 --> 02:35:41.090]  And he doesn't really have a backbone, as he backpedaled on his very soft statement
[02:35:41.090 --> 02:35:44.029]  on Ukraine, which was disappointing.
[02:35:44.029 --> 02:35:47.250]  But when it comes to COVID, he has an almost impeccable record.
[02:35:47.250 --> 02:35:51.770]  He was perfect during those key moments and situations that truly made the biggest difference
[02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:56.770]  when it came to pushing back against the lockdowns and the draconian policies that, let's be
[02:35:56.770 --> 02:36:02.570]  honest here, were put forward by Donald Trump, who still hasn't recused himself, who still
[02:36:02.570 --> 02:36:07.210]  hasn't come out and said, hey, when those 600 doctors came to me with a signed letter
[02:36:07.210 --> 02:36:11.369]  begging me not to do lockdowns, maybe I should have listened to them.
[02:36:11.369 --> 02:36:12.369]  And he didn't.
[02:36:12.369 --> 02:36:15.890]  Donald Trump's administration implemented the 15 days to slow the spread.
[02:36:15.890 --> 02:36:17.529]  They're the ones who implemented the lockdowns.
[02:36:17.529 --> 02:36:22.930]  They gave everyone 2K checks, which were absolutely nothing compared to the mega bucks that were
[02:36:22.930 --> 02:36:25.210]  given to all the major corporations.
[02:36:25.210 --> 02:36:29.570]  Hundreds of them were just handed out to Big Pharma, to the military industrial complex,
[02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:33.090]  to of course all the other big international corporate giants out there.
[02:36:33.090 --> 02:36:34.789]  Trump went on and attacked Sweden.
[02:36:34.789 --> 02:36:38.810]  He attacked his Republican counterparts who didn't want to lock down.
[02:36:38.810 --> 02:36:40.930]  He implemented Operation Warp Speed.
[02:36:40.930 --> 02:36:42.650]  And I'm saying all of this because it matters.
[02:36:42.650 --> 02:36:45.529]  I'm going to tell you why it matters in just a little bit.
[02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:47.289]  But he's still promoting the vaccine.
[02:36:47.289 --> 02:36:52.490]  He gave Fauci a very coveted award during the last days of his presidencies.
[02:36:52.810 --> 02:36:56.970]  And I say this because when we look at Trump, he met with RFK Jr.
[02:36:56.970 --> 02:37:02.170]  This is on record and said, hey, I'm actually going to be investigating the vaccines.
[02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:05.970]  Then according to Bill Gates, Bill Gates had a private meeting with him, told him not to
[02:37:05.970 --> 02:37:06.970]  do it.
[02:37:06.970 --> 02:37:11.050]  And then Donald Trump didn't have an official investigation into the vaccine.
[02:37:11.050 --> 02:37:16.730]  And then Donald Trump asked Bill Gates personally to be his science advisor and his science czar,
[02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:18.490]  which Bill Gates now brags about.
[02:37:18.490 --> 02:37:21.490]  He declined and told Donald Trump that he won't be doing this.
[02:37:21.490 --> 02:37:26.609]  Douglas McGregor actually came out and said that he was hired by the Trump administration
[02:37:26.609 --> 02:37:31.170]  during the last days of his office to try to get all the troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.
[02:37:31.170 --> 02:37:35.029]  Trump agreed with it, signed it and then didn't follow through.
[02:37:35.029 --> 02:37:38.210]  Trump also promised that he was going to release the JFK papers.
[02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:42.789]  And then, of course, he didn't, which shows us who's really in charge here when Trump's
[02:37:42.789 --> 02:37:43.789]  in office.
[02:37:43.789 --> 02:37:46.369]  And this is why I say there's a bigger kind of illusion here.
[02:37:46.369 --> 02:37:48.930]  There's a lot of other people behind the scenes here.
[02:37:48.930 --> 02:37:52.369]  Trump, again, called himself a nationalist and a globalist.
[02:37:52.369 --> 02:37:54.970]  So he could be he could be coming from very different perspectives.
[02:37:54.970 --> 02:37:57.090]  He has many different people pulling at his ear.
[02:37:57.090 --> 02:38:00.050]  He has a lot of other people making decisions for him as well.
[02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:05.449]  And when we look at this broader perspective, I'm worried about a Trump presidency, mainly
[02:38:05.449 --> 02:38:09.810]  because it looks like he's going to win this indictment, propel them forward.
[02:38:09.810 --> 02:38:16.810]  And if he does win specifically, if you are, let's just say a Bill Gates or Dr. Fauci type,
[02:38:17.609 --> 02:38:20.330]  and Joe Biden even just came out a few days ago.
[02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:24.330]  All of them came out and said, hey, the pandemic that we had was nothing.
[02:38:24.330 --> 02:38:25.609]  It was just a test run.
[02:38:25.609 --> 02:38:29.609]  They essentially said that there's going to be a bigger pandemic coming our way.
[02:38:29.609 --> 02:38:32.970]  But if Donald Trump becomes the president of the United States, which it looks like
[02:38:32.970 --> 02:38:39.369]  he's on the road to becoming the president of the United States, what better way to compromise
[02:38:39.369 --> 02:38:44.330]  him to destroy his administration than as soon as he comes out, release one of the other
[02:38:44.330 --> 02:38:49.130]  gain of function viruses that they've been working on and developing and then checkmate
[02:38:49.130 --> 02:38:53.369]  Donald Trump is going to be doing whatever the intelligentsia state wants him to do,
[02:38:53.369 --> 02:38:57.369]  going to doing another warp speed, going to promoting another vaccine.
[02:38:57.369 --> 02:39:00.410]  This is something that I just personally think about, that I personally worry.
[02:39:00.410 --> 02:39:02.650]  And I think it should be on our consensus.
[02:39:02.650 --> 02:39:05.130]  It should be something that we should be thinking about.
[02:39:05.130 --> 02:39:08.170]  And we should be trying to hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire.
[02:39:08.170 --> 02:39:11.130]  So he comes out and says, hey, guys, this was a big mistake here.
[02:39:11.130 --> 02:39:11.930]  I shouldn't have done this.
[02:39:11.930 --> 02:39:15.930]  But until I hear that, I'm going to be very skeptical of the lead front runner in the
[02:39:15.930 --> 02:39:16.730]  Republican team.
[02:39:16.730 --> 02:39:18.330]  I mean, I totally agree.
[02:39:18.330 --> 02:39:19.289]  He was great on the border.
[02:39:19.289 --> 02:39:20.410]  Great setting up a China.
[02:39:20.410 --> 02:39:22.730]  So many other things getting inside of the WHO.
[02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:25.609]  But then he just transferred it to Fauci and Bill Gates.
[02:39:25.609 --> 02:39:27.609]  So then what I'm not a lesser to evil guys.
[02:39:27.609 --> 02:39:29.210]  But what do we do?
[02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:33.930]  Support DeSantis to support Joe Biden or just say, hey, these presidents are all puppets.
[02:39:33.930 --> 02:39:34.810]  They can't save us.
[02:39:34.810 --> 02:39:38.010]  We've got to take over our local governments legally and lawfully and just block it at
[02:39:38.010 --> 02:39:39.210]  that level and just not comply.
[02:39:40.170 --> 02:39:41.930]  Personally, the conversation matters.
[02:39:41.930 --> 02:39:43.369]  Your input, your voice matters.
[02:39:43.369 --> 02:39:47.449]  Holding Donald Trump accountable, even if you like Donald Trump, is extremely important
[02:39:47.449 --> 02:39:52.570]  because these people rely on us and our consensus and our acquiescence to them.
[02:39:52.570 --> 02:39:56.090]  And if we stop giving them all of our power and we hold them accountable and we stop
[02:39:56.090 --> 02:40:01.449]  worshiping politicians, I think people who support politicians are individuals who believe
[02:40:01.449 --> 02:40:03.449]  strippers really like them at the strip club.
[02:40:03.449 --> 02:40:07.609]  They're individuals that are obviously in it for themselves here.
[02:40:07.609 --> 02:40:09.850]  Obviously, we're in a very tough situation here.
[02:40:09.850 --> 02:40:12.250]  The dialogue and the conversation matter.
[02:40:12.250 --> 02:40:16.090]  And again, even even though I don't agree with Robert Kennedy, Jr., on a lot of his
[02:40:16.090 --> 02:40:18.890]  policies, he's starting a conversation about the vaccines.
[02:40:18.890 --> 02:40:24.250]  He's starting a conversation about our medical system, conversations that could make people
[02:40:24.250 --> 02:40:26.970]  empowered with choices in their own lives.
[02:40:26.970 --> 02:40:27.470]  That's right.
[02:40:30.810 --> 02:40:32.650]  Has the total establishment against him.
[02:40:32.650 --> 02:40:34.650]  Trump only has part of the establishment against him.
[02:40:35.369 --> 02:40:38.170]  What matters most is the ideas and the conversations.
[02:40:38.170 --> 02:40:40.730]  And we can't be afraid to have tough conversations.
[02:40:40.730 --> 02:40:43.210]  We can't be afraid to criticize our own side.
[02:40:43.210 --> 02:40:48.090]  I'm even going as far as saying, hey, Tucker Carlson, 20, 24, I just launched a T-shirt
[02:40:48.090 --> 02:40:52.730]  on the best political shirts dot com, specifically launching a Tucker Carlson for president of
[02:40:52.730 --> 02:40:57.210]  the United States, because even if even though, you know, that's not really kind of logical,
[02:40:57.210 --> 02:40:57.930]  maybe it will happen.
[02:40:57.930 --> 02:41:00.090]  Maybe it won't be good.
[02:41:00.090 --> 02:41:00.970]  I'm playing the same thing.
[02:41:00.970 --> 02:41:02.170]  So it's a great idea.
[02:41:02.170 --> 02:41:04.810]  This is just to say the ideas we like for president.
[02:41:05.770 --> 02:41:06.490]  Exactly.
[02:41:06.490 --> 02:41:11.289]  And those ideas and those conversations and holding our representatives feet to the fire
[02:41:11.289 --> 02:41:15.210]  and saying, hey, we as American people, you need us.
[02:41:16.010 --> 02:41:19.770]  You need us to go along with your larger messaging here.
[02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:22.970]  Obviously, we are in a lot of trouble.
[02:41:22.970 --> 02:41:28.570]  Obviously, we're heading down a path of very bad situations that are going to be hitting
[02:41:28.570 --> 02:41:29.130]  everyone.
[02:41:29.210 --> 02:41:34.970]  And this is the time that I think we have to stop looking for politicians as the saviors
[02:41:34.970 --> 02:41:36.010]  of us.
[02:41:36.010 --> 02:41:40.090]  We have to stop putting those tools that we have to make work for us.
[02:41:40.090 --> 02:41:45.050]  Since you mentioned it, let's play the last 30 seconds of his last show, Friday, where
[02:41:45.050 --> 02:41:47.449]  he's eating pizza, saying I'm going to eat pizza.
[02:41:47.449 --> 02:41:48.490]  I'm not going to eat bugs.
[02:41:48.490 --> 02:41:51.609]  I want to come back and show mainstream news saying you will eat the bugs.
[02:41:51.609 --> 02:41:53.050]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:41:53.050 --> 02:41:54.410]  We're talking to Luke Rodowski about it.
[02:41:54.410 --> 02:41:55.050]  Play that club.
[02:41:56.010 --> 02:41:56.490]  Wait a second.
[02:41:56.490 --> 02:41:58.010]  What a great way to end the week.
[02:41:58.010 --> 02:41:59.609]  Truly, that was a great segment.
[02:41:59.609 --> 02:42:01.449]  And I'm just grateful that you came on.
[02:42:01.449 --> 02:42:02.970]  And I'm especially grateful for the pie.
[02:42:02.970 --> 02:42:04.010]  Thank you for having me.
[02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:04.650]  Appreciate it.
[02:42:04.650 --> 02:42:05.609]  Employee of the Week.
[02:42:05.609 --> 02:42:07.130]  We're going to just make it of the year.
[02:42:07.130 --> 02:42:09.050]  Tyler Morrell of Coco's Pizza.
[02:42:09.050 --> 02:42:11.050]  That's it for us for the week.
[02:42:11.050 --> 02:42:12.090]  We'll be back.
[02:42:12.090 --> 02:42:16.090]  By the way, the entire episode of Let Them Eat Bugs, not quite as good as pizza, streaming
[02:42:16.090 --> 02:42:16.890]  now on Fox station.
[02:42:16.890 --> 02:42:19.609]  Use the promo code Originals for 30 days free.
[02:42:19.609 --> 02:42:21.369]  And we'll be back on Monday.
[02:42:21.369 --> 02:42:24.170]  In the meantime, have the best weekend with the ones that you love.
[02:42:24.170 --> 02:42:24.810]  And we'll see you then.
[02:42:25.770 --> 02:42:30.010]  Then he left and gave a Heritage Foundation speech that I thought was particularly powerful.
[02:42:30.010 --> 02:42:32.010]  Luke, we'll talk about that too before we get into the bugs.
[02:42:32.010 --> 02:42:34.490]  We come back where he said, it's good versus evil.
[02:42:34.490 --> 02:42:37.529]  We have to stop being mindless drones, lemmings.
[02:42:37.529 --> 02:42:40.010]  We have to stop going with the herd mentality.
[02:42:40.010 --> 02:42:41.449]  That is so true.
[02:42:41.449 --> 02:42:43.529]  And he said, both parties are the problem.
[02:42:43.529 --> 02:42:45.289]  They're working together against you.
[02:42:45.289 --> 02:42:47.609]  And that's what the system cannot stand.
[02:42:47.609 --> 02:42:49.289]  Luke Rodowski, We Are Change.
[02:42:49.289 --> 02:42:50.890]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.
[02:42:50.890 --> 02:42:51.529]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:51.529 --> 02:42:52.010]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.369 --> 02:43:03.050]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[02:43:03.050 --> 02:43:04.410]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:43:04.410 --> 02:43:05.449]  People said, no way.
[02:43:05.449 --> 02:43:07.130]  He's the most powerful ever happened.
[02:43:07.130 --> 02:43:09.210]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:43:09.210 --> 02:43:11.850]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[02:43:11.850 --> 02:43:15.050]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:43:15.050 --> 02:43:16.810]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[02:43:16.810 --> 02:43:22.970]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe
[02:43:22.970 --> 02:43:23.529]  Rogan.
[02:43:23.529 --> 02:43:26.410]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:43:27.210 --> 02:43:29.289]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:43:29.289 --> 02:43:33.930]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:43:33.930 --> 02:43:37.609]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:43:37.609 --> 02:43:40.810]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:43.369]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[02:43:43.369 --> 02:43:44.730]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:43:44.730 --> 02:43:48.570]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products
[02:43:48.570 --> 02:43:50.490]  at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:44:29.529 --> 02:44:31.289]  true alpha male path.

[02:44:49.289 --> 02:44:51.930]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:44:53.130 --> 02:45:01.529]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:45:06.170 --> 02:45:07.529]  I want you all to know something.
[02:45:07.529 --> 02:45:09.449]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:09.449 --> 02:45:13.050]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:45:13.050 --> 02:45:16.090]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:45:16.090 --> 02:45:20.330]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:45:20.330 --> 02:45:22.010]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:22.650 --> 02:45:26.170]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:45:26.170 --> 02:45:29.850]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:45:29.850 --> 02:45:33.770]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:36.810]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:45:37.850 --> 02:45:40.410]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:45:40.410 --> 02:45:42.890]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:45:42.890 --> 02:45:46.010]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:45:46.010 --> 02:45:50.730]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:45:52.250 --> 02:46:02.730]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:46:02.730 --> 02:46:04.090]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:46:04.730 --> 02:46:07.930]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:46:08.650 --> 02:46:12.730]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:46:14.090 --> 02:46:16.810]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:46:17.529 --> 02:46:22.170]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:46:22.170 --> 02:46:23.609]  five, six, seven days a week.
[02:46:24.410 --> 02:46:25.449]  It's really just incredible.
[02:46:26.410 --> 02:46:29.369]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:46:29.930 --> 02:46:35.130]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:46:35.770 --> 02:46:36.810]  I know you spread the word.
[02:46:36.810 --> 02:46:37.689]  I know you pray for us.
[02:46:37.689 --> 02:46:38.330]  That's wonderful.
[02:46:38.330 --> 02:46:38.890]  Keep doing it.
[02:46:38.890 --> 02:46:44.010]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great
[02:46:44.010 --> 02:46:47.689]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:46:47.689 --> 02:46:52.010]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:52.010 --> 02:46:55.609]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[02:46:55.609 --> 02:46:57.050]  our funding problems will be over.
[02:46:57.050 --> 02:46:57.930]  Please take action now.
[02:46:59.210 --> 02:47:06.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  You say that you want to go to a land that's far away, how are we supposed to get there
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  There's an article up on it, PolarWars.com, that really caught my imagination.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  And there's no audio to it, it's a surveillance camera.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  The Arizona Capitol has a private lounge.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:58.000]  Private companies have restaurants, lounges, they lease it.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  They provide a lounge, they provide food, drinks.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:08.000]  And they kept having the Bibles removed and out of the lounge, so the security had a camera there.
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  A Democrat lawmaker, ordained minister, who goes around speaking out against the Bible,
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  that's why she became an ordained minister, obviously it was to oppose the wolf in sheep's clothing,
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:22.000]  caught swiping and hiding Bibles in a private lounge in the Arizona State Capitol.
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  Now you think, well that's just one crazy person.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:30.000]  You know it's over 20,000 churches in the last five years burned down and destroyed in Europe.
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:34.000]  It's happening here. These people are demonically controlled.
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  Doesn't mean churches are perfect, but it's the Bible that drives them crazy
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  and it's the churches that are promoting that, they're attacking because they want the state to be God.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  And they infiltrated the seminaries, the Protestant, the Catholic, all of it, and they're doing this.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  Before I get to the other news, I wanted to talk about this, Luke.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  A dim lawmaker caught hiding Bibles at Arizona Capitol.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  What do you think, Elon Musk talks about good versus evil.
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  Tucker Carlson said, you know, he didn't really believe in God,
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  but he said now he sees it everywhere that we should pray and that there is an evil force trying to destroy us.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  What's your personal view on that?
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  It depends on how far you want to go down the rabbit hole,
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.000]  because we could have a four hour long conversation about this,
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  but I think just to kind of simplify it and just to make it as short and as sweet as possible here,
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:24.000]  there is a larger spiritual war out there. You can feel it.
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  You could feel it, especially when you start speaking truth, living the truest version of yourselves
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  and not stifling yourself and just representing who you are as a human being
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  and starting those conversations and trying to help people.
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  When you help people, you feel good.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  When you don't help people, when you lie to people.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  Now, imagine this on a larger scale, when you start wars, when you release bioweapons,
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  when you run larger psyopsis, when you run social media companies that are creating depression,
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  suicide and self-harm in young children, imagine how you feel doing those things.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  And I do believe a lot of these people, you know, there's a famous saying,
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  you always got two wolves in you, one's a happy, positive loved one,
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  one's filled with hate and anger and destitute.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  I do believe that once you spiral, your kind of frequency, your energy in those realms
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  becomes very, very prominent to the point where there are other kind of entities,
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  there are other larger energies in this world that are attracted to that,
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  that do take over when that happens and do have a bigger calling to that.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:32.000]  Exactly, and they don't want to be reminded of the way out or of God or of higher levels,
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  so that's why they attack it.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  And they're allergic to it and they're afraid of it because then they have to give up their demons.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  And there's a reason a lot of people in the music industry
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  literally say that they sold their soul to the devil.
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  Bob Dylan in most interviews said, no, I sold my soul to Satan.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  Exactly, mock child sacrifices, worshiping Moloch, doing unspeakable things in coffins at Yale.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  I mean, it's not us being the weirdos, right?
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:04.000]  We can only talk about it on a kind of surface level, you know, to the public.
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000]  Even then, people are going to think we're crazy.
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  We're not crazy.
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  The people in the coffins, the people running around in the woods naked doing mock child sacrifice,
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:15.000]  they're the crazy ones, and they're the ones at the helm of a lot of powerful institutions
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:18.000]  calling the shots here making a lot of decisions for you.
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  And remember CERN did mock human sacrifices.
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  They had a whole occult ritual.
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:27.000]  We talked about this on the Tim Gatz podcast a couple years ago.
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:32.000]  They had a whole satanic ritual where they went over a lot of this.
[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000]  They do a lot of this stuff out in the open.
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  They do a lot of this stuff sometimes because they want to get caught.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:43.000]  It creates an energetic web or signature that draws in the energy.
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  Exactly, and that's why they have their symbols,
[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:49.000]  and their symbols are also connected to this larger kind of force out there.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000]  We might be going too far into the rabbit hole here.
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:55.000]  I don't know how far you want to go here, Alex, but we could go down further if you want.
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:56.000]  We can go all the way to the bottom.
[02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  No, it's good versus evil.
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:58.000]  Go ahead.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:51:59.000]  Absolutely.
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  You're a smart guy.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000]  I've known you 18, 19 years.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  At the bottom of the rabbit hole, what's there?
[02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  It's a larger fight between good and evil.
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  As you described, it's an energetic force.
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:15.000]  The life that we're living on right now has many different dimensions that we're not privy to,
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  that our senses are not aware of, and when you really truly do look at it,
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  you have to be extremely careful how you navigate this world with your own personal decisions
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:28.000]  because every little decision you take matters, and this is what they're afraid of.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  They're afraid of the conversations.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:32.000]  They're afraid of you even knowing that there's another side.
[02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000]  They're afraid of you seeing them,
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:40.000]  and once you see them for who they truly are, that absolutely destroys the whole facade.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:45.000]  The whole game is over once you're able to see everything that there really are,
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:48.000]  so this is why it's so important for independent media.
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:52.000]  This is why it's so important that voices out there go out there and speak the larger truth
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000]  because there is a larger residency.
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:55.000]  There is a larger frequency.
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:56.000]  There is something.
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000]  Once you start doing good, once you start speaking truth,
[02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000]  that you feel a weight lifted off of you,
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:06.000]  that you feel this larger on a small micro level a part of the larger spiritual war,
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000]  and it starts with you being the best version of yourself.
[02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:12.000]  That's why they got so mad at Tucker because I'm told they were already planning to get rid of him
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000]  before his contract was up in six months.
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000]  Folks, you're getting the inside here,
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:22.000]  but when Rupert Murdoch a month before was in Bel Air with his new girlfriend,
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  his fiancée, and Tucker was invited.
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  She wanted him there.
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  She read the Bible, Exodus.
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  She said, I think Tucker's a messenger of God.
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  Murdoch left the table, didn't talk to him again, and now this happened.
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:38.000]  And then they saw that speech at the Heritage Foundation where he said we've got to call on God
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:41.000]  because that's us with our free will saying we're open to the good.
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000]  They don't want us to open that channel.
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:44.000]  That's why.
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000]  It was the final straw was God.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:50.000]  It's a spiritual war, and Tucker during his last video on Twitter said, quote,
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:54.000]  current orthodoxies won't last as he accused both political parties
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:57.000]  and their donors of colluding to shut down conversations.
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:02.000]  He said the people in charge are being hysterical and aggressive and are afraid
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:08.000]  when honest people say what's true calmly and without embarrassment, they become powerful.
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:12.000]  Those are the words of Tucker Carlson, and he absolutely hit the nail on the head.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  He's absolutely right when it comes to these larger notions, these larger understandings,
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  these larger frequencies and energy vibrations out there that they are deathly afraid of
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  because all it has to do with is us seeing and they don't.
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.000]  And they don't.
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  I mean, the universe is like a radio station.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  We decide what to tune to.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.000]  God of the devil or ourselves, which is Job's back to the devil.
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  Let's play a short clip of his speech at Heritage Foundation.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  Here it is.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.000]  And evil is characterized by their opposites.
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  Violence, hate, disorder, division, disorganization and filth.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  So if you are all in on the things that produce the latter basket of outcomes,
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  what you're really advocating for is evil.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  That's just true.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  Those are manifestations of some larger force acting upon us.
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  It's just so obvious.
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  It's completely obvious.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:15.000]  And even I have concluded it might be worth taking just 10 minutes out of your busy schedule
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  to say a prayer for the future.
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  And I hope you will.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  All right.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  So Tucker's told me personally, and I'm not bragging, it wasn't off record,
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  but I've really talked about it because I've been giving problems.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  Now he's fully emerged.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  It's here.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  I woke him up 13 years ago.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  He came here to apologize.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:32.000]  We've been friends since, hung out a lot, dinner, visit him, all that.
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  But he's totally on board, totally awake.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  And it's not about Alex Jones getting the credit for this.
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  This is the listener supporting us, the guest, everybody.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  But it was this show that was the main thing that woke him up.
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  Like with vampires, Count Dracula, they say, well, Count Dracula bit me.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  Now I'm a vampire.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:50.000]  Well, it's the opposite.
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  Infowars bit Tucker Carlson.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  And this is one of our biggest successes, folks.
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  And so I'm very proud of it.
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  Luke, comments on that?
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  Well, truth has a residency.
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  It also has a frequency.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  You could try to deny it for as long as you can, but it surfaces to the top eventually.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000]  And when it does, there is a reckoning.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  There is an understanding.
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  There is an awakening of the general public.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  And I think we're going through that phrase right now.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  And this is why they're trying to accelerate their psyopsis as much as they are right now.
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:24.000]  He also had said something about prayer, which I think is absolutely important.
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  Some people pray.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  Some people meditate.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  Whatever it is.
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  But just taking ten minutes to yourself, just to breathe, just to see who you are, what you are,
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  just to try to tune yourself in, just to try to get your gut activated.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  There's a reason gut instincts are also extremely important.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  There's a reason the main weapon that they use against the population is to destroy their gut,
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  which is key to their immune systems, which is key to their mental health.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  Because we know we have brain tissue in our spine that hooks into our gut.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  The gut is literally where we feel what our subconscious thinks.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  It's the second brain, and it's been directly under attack, not just by big pharma,
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  but by the food industries, the medical industrial complex.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  Autism rates, by the way, since 1990, have gone up 2,094%.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  That is not a coincidence.
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  That is not an accident.
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  All the top institutions are just kind of like, whatever.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  These numbers are going up.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:20.000]  Infertility is going up.
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  Our ability to be healthy is being destroyed right in front of us because of this alarm.
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  Our longevity is dropping.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:28.000]  Got to go to break for two minutes.
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  Five more minutes.

[02:58:13.700 --> 02:58:17.700]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things,
[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:22.700]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart,
[02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:25.700]  your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:58:25.700 --> 02:58:28.700]  It is the super fuel.
[02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:30.700]  Rain Force Plus is great. Rain Force Ultra is great.
[02:58:30.700 --> 02:58:32.700]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[02:58:32.700 --> 02:58:35.700]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:37.700]  This is the boss.
[02:58:37.700 --> 02:58:41.700]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, m4warstore.com.
[02:58:41.700 --> 02:58:44.700]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:51.700]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot,
[02:58:51.700 --> 02:58:53.700]  because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:58:53.700 --> 02:58:55.700]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:58:55.700 --> 02:58:57.700]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[02:58:57.700 --> 02:58:59.700]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:02.700]  And it says, Political Prisoner.
[02:59:02.700 --> 02:59:04.700]  With an image of President Trump.
[02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:07.700]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:59:07.700 --> 02:59:09.700]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:59:09.700 --> 02:59:11.700]  Political Prisoner.
[02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:15.700]  With Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[02:59:15.700 --> 02:59:17.700]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:59:17.700 --> 02:59:21.700]  It says m4wars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:59:21.700 --> 02:59:23.700]  We also have Alex Joves for President.
[02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:24.700]  No, I'm not running for President.
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:26.700]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:27.700]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:28.700]  Alex Joves for President.
[02:59:28.700 --> 02:59:30.700]  2024. It's a fun conversational piece.
[02:59:30.700 --> 02:59:31.700]  And a limited edition shirt.
[02:59:31.700 --> 02:59:33.700]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:59:33.700 --> 02:59:38.700]  So get your Alex Joves for President and Trump mugshot shirts
[02:59:38.700 --> 02:59:46.700]  at m4warsstore.com or by calling toll-free, triple-A, 253-3139.
[02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:53.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:53.700 --> 02:59:55.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:59.700 --> 03:00:02.700]  Alright, final segment before Drew Hernandez takes over.
[03:00:02.700 --> 03:00:03.700]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:03.700 --> 03:00:05.700]  Luke Rudowsky's here with WeAreChanged.org.
[03:00:05.700 --> 03:00:06.700]  I got it right.
[03:00:06.700 --> 03:00:07.700]  My sheet said com.
[03:00:07.700 --> 03:00:08.700]  I thought it was like, it's org.
[03:00:08.700 --> 03:00:09.700]  It's org.
[03:00:09.700 --> 03:00:11.700]  Not all his great work there is podcasting shows.
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:12.700]  WeAreChanged.org.
[03:00:12.700 --> 03:00:17.700]  Okay, so you were making the point about it's not about the churches.
[03:00:17.700 --> 03:00:20.700]  That's men, in most cases, trying to get in front of us and God.
[03:00:20.700 --> 03:00:21.700]  We know God's real.
[03:00:21.700 --> 03:00:22.700]  The priest class gets in front of it.
[03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:25.700]  There are some real priests, some real leaders that can help us get to God.
[03:00:25.700 --> 03:00:27.700]  But in a lot of cases, they've been bought off.
[03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:30.700]  They're controlled like this woman that's a preacher that's running around
[03:00:30.700 --> 03:00:32.700]  hiding the Bibles at the Arizona Capitol.
[03:00:32.700 --> 03:00:34.700]  That's how they took over.
[03:00:34.700 --> 03:00:36.700]  But God's real.
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:37.700]  The universe that God controls is real.
[03:00:37.700 --> 03:00:39.700]  You got to reach out, folks.
[03:00:39.700 --> 03:00:40.700]  The enemy doesn't want you to do that.
[03:00:40.700 --> 03:00:42.700]  There's Paul Watson's latest headline on InfoWars.
[03:00:42.700 --> 03:00:45.700]  Believe in higher power surges amongst American youth.
[03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:46.700]  It's happening.
[03:00:46.700 --> 03:00:48.700]  The new renaissance, the new great awakening is here.
[03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:51.700]  Closing comments on that and how we come together, create love,
[03:00:51.700 --> 03:00:57.700]  encounter their residents with love, with power, with justice, with courage.
[03:00:57.700 --> 03:00:59.700]  Well, decentralization is the answer.
[03:00:59.700 --> 03:01:00.700]  It's the key.
[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:03.700]  Taking personal responsibility, being happy and healthy is an act of
[03:01:03.700 --> 03:01:06.700]  resistance in our modern-day society as, of course,
[03:01:06.700 --> 03:01:08.700]  a lot of people are under attack.
[03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:09.700]  And, you know, it's fun.
[03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:11.700]  It's easy to make fun of these people, but we need empathy.
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:14.700]  And we need to call out the bull crap on all the sides,
[03:01:14.700 --> 03:01:15.700]  including even some of the churches.
[03:01:15.700 --> 03:01:19.700]  There's a lot of horrible child molesters inside of major churches
[03:01:19.700 --> 03:01:21.700]  that also need to be called out as well.
[03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:24.700]  So there's a lot of monsters all over the place.
[03:01:24.700 --> 03:01:25.700]  Be an individual.
[03:01:25.700 --> 03:01:27.700]  Question everything yourselves.
[03:01:27.700 --> 03:01:29.700]  But right now during this key moment in time,
[03:01:29.700 --> 03:01:32.700]  we need to start those conversations because they are deathly afraid
[03:01:32.700 --> 03:01:36.700]  of you speaking truth, of you finding out exactly what's going on,
[03:01:36.700 --> 03:01:38.700]  of you doing your own homework, your own research,
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:42.700]  and then making decisions for yourself that don't incentivize the beast,
[03:01:42.700 --> 03:01:47.700]  the monster, you not giving your dollars, your money, your time,
[03:01:47.700 --> 03:01:51.700]  and energy into all these negative realms and all these negative,
[03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:53.700]  horrible creatures and entities out there.
[03:01:53.700 --> 03:01:57.700]  And whether it's the latest, you know, movie or TV series or Netflix,
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:01:59.700]  whatever it is, you have a choice.
[03:01:59.700 --> 03:02:03.700]  You could do that or you could spend your time and energy trying to,
[03:02:03.700 --> 03:02:06.700]  of course, develop and grow and support independent media
[03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:09.700]  that's been standing with the people calling out their bull crap
[03:02:09.700 --> 03:02:13.700]  and trying to save people from the larger weaponization of information
[03:02:13.700 --> 03:02:15.700]  that has been happening in this country.
[03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:17.700]  And, you know, Alex, you know, we had our problems.
[03:02:17.700 --> 03:02:18.700]  We had our differences.
[03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:20.700]  But I think we need to set those aside more than ever
[03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:22.700]  because we're in deep trouble if we don't.
[03:02:22.700 --> 03:02:24.700]  We're in a bad situation.
[03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:25.700]  It's going to get worse from here.
[03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:27.700]  And with those situations,
[03:02:27.700 --> 03:02:29.700]  you could either become the strongest version of yourself
[03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:31.700]  or you could be destroyed by those situations.
[03:02:31.700 --> 03:02:34.700]  But unless we come together, we're going to be taken out individually.
[03:02:34.700 --> 03:02:38.700]  And this is why it's so important more than ever to come together,
[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:39.700]  build communities.
[03:02:39.700 --> 03:02:41.700]  I'm doing that right now in Miami, Florida.
[03:02:41.700 --> 03:02:44.700]  I'm going to be doing an in-real-life meetup in Florida.
[03:02:44.700 --> 03:02:48.700]  For information about that, you could go to LukeUnfiltered.com
[03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:51.700]  for members of my website specifically.
[03:02:51.700 --> 03:02:55.700]  And it's about making those small steps, having those small conversations,
[03:02:55.700 --> 03:02:58.700]  reaching out to individuals, trying to be there for themselves,
[03:02:58.700 --> 03:03:00.700]  building neighborhoods, building communities,
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:02.700]  more importantly building families.
[03:03:02.700 --> 03:03:07.700]  They don't want you being someone who has a family.
[03:03:07.700 --> 03:03:11.700]  They don't want to have any real community, just the fake digital community.
[03:03:11.700 --> 03:03:13.700]  So let me ask you this in closing.
[03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:16.700]  I believe humanity is winning right now.
[03:03:16.700 --> 03:03:17.700]  I believe the globalists are desperate.
[03:03:17.700 --> 03:03:19.700]  I believe they're scared.
[03:03:19.700 --> 03:03:20.700]  I don't believe.
[03:03:20.700 --> 03:03:21.700]  I know they're losing.
[03:03:21.700 --> 03:03:24.700]  I agree with you in some elements.
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:27.700]  I do believe it's going to get a little worse before it gets any kind of better.
[03:03:27.700 --> 03:03:31.700]  But with that, you have an opportunity to challenge yourself, to test yourself,
[03:03:31.700 --> 03:03:35.700]  and to use those challenges as a way to persevere and be strong.
[03:03:35.700 --> 03:03:40.700]  So when looking at the problems ahead, don't look for anyone to solve them for you.
[03:03:40.700 --> 03:03:41.700]  Be ready.
[03:03:41.700 --> 03:03:43.700]  You don't walk into the gym and see a bunch of weights and say,
[03:03:43.700 --> 03:03:44.700]  oh, my gosh, I'm scared.
[03:03:44.700 --> 03:03:46.700]  Those weights are going to make you stronger.
[03:03:46.700 --> 03:03:47.700]  Exactly.
[03:03:47.700 --> 03:03:48.700]  You want that adversity.
[03:03:48.700 --> 03:03:50.700]  You want that challenge.
[03:03:50.700 --> 03:03:52.700]  And I think we're all being challenged right now more than ever,
[03:03:53.700 --> 03:03:55.700]  especially when it comes to the financial situation in the United States,
[03:03:55.700 --> 03:03:59.700]  especially when it comes to the health situation inside of the United States.
[03:03:59.700 --> 03:04:00.700]  So take control of your health.
[03:04:00.700 --> 03:04:01.700]  Take control of your life.
[03:04:01.700 --> 03:04:03.700]  Take control of your finances.
[03:04:03.700 --> 03:04:07.700]  This is what I've been focusing on and working on specifically with LukeUnfiltered.com.
[03:04:07.700 --> 03:04:11.700]  And I think the more we do that, the more we understand the power that we have as individuals,
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:15.700]  the less we give it out to other individuals, the better we will be.
[03:04:15.700 --> 03:04:16.700]  Time to come together.
[03:04:16.700 --> 03:04:18.700]  The time is now more than ever.
[03:04:18.700 --> 03:04:21.700]  Luke, join us again soon, LukeUnfiltered.com.
[03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:23.700]  God bless you, and we love you, brother.
[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:24.700]  Thank you, man.
[03:04:24.700 --> 03:04:25.700]  Thanks for having me.
[03:04:25.700 --> 03:04:27.700]  And it's been a long time, so it's good to be back.
[03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:28.700]  It's good to have you here.
[03:04:28.700 --> 03:04:31.700]  We never really had a fight like 10 years ago, a little bit of arguing about some media stuff,
[03:04:31.700 --> 03:04:34.700]  and then 10 years goes by like 10 seconds.
[03:04:34.700 --> 03:04:35.700]  I know.
[03:04:35.700 --> 03:04:39.700]  And then we're going to be 10 years from now, 20 years from now, hopefully 30 years from now,
[03:04:39.700 --> 03:04:41.700]  and I don't see much changing.
[03:04:41.700 --> 03:04:42.700]  Love you, brother.
[03:04:42.700 --> 03:04:43.700]  All right.
[03:04:43.700 --> 03:04:48.700]  The great Drew Hernandez takes over now, then in 55 minutes,
[03:04:48.700 --> 03:04:53.700]  Owen, the cup destroyer, destroyer, takes over from the Infowars studios in Austin, Texas.
[03:04:53.700 --> 03:04:54.700]  Please share the link.
[03:04:54.700 --> 03:04:57.700]  You are the resistance.
[03:04:57.700 --> 03:05:04.700]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:05:04.700 --> 03:05:07.700]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:15.700]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[03:05:15.700 --> 03:05:18.700]  still highly toxic but containable.
[03:05:18.700 --> 03:05:24.700]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:05:24.700 --> 03:05:29.700]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury,
[03:05:29.700 --> 03:05:32.700]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:05:32.700 --> 03:05:39.700]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:05:39.700 --> 03:05:41.700]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:05:41.700 --> 03:05:46.700]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:05:46.700 --> 03:05:52.700]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[03:05:52.700 --> 03:05:56.700]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:57.700 --> 03:06:11.700]  I gotta ask yourself, why are large portions of the population of the youth waking up to the reality of a higher power?
[03:06:11.700 --> 03:06:14.700]  That there's something out there greater than themselves?
[03:06:14.700 --> 03:06:18.700]  That there's someone out there greater than themselves?
[03:06:18.700 --> 03:06:21.700]  And that goes both ways, good and evil.
[03:06:21.700 --> 03:06:26.700]  God is greater than anything, anyone, whatever you could think of in your mind.
[03:06:26.700 --> 03:06:31.700]  Jesus Christ is more powerful, Alpha Omega, beginning and the end.
[03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:34.700]  He was here yesterday, today, and forevermore.
[03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:36.700]  He's there.
[03:06:36.700 --> 03:06:38.700]  And you gotta ask yourself, what's the other side of that?
[03:06:38.700 --> 03:06:45.700]  The other side of that is, Lucifer the devil is 100% real as well.
[03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:46.700]  How do we know that?
[03:06:46.700 --> 03:06:48.700]  The Bible authenticates it.
[03:06:48.700 --> 03:06:50.700]  The occult authenticates it.
[03:06:50.700 --> 03:06:52.700]  Luciferians authenticate it.
[03:06:52.700 --> 03:06:58.700]  They all worship Lucifer himself with open opposition towards God, the God of the Bible.
[03:06:58.700 --> 03:07:01.700]  They never want to be around the name Jesus Christ.
[03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:06.700]  They could never sit around and accept the fact that someone is worshipping Jesus Christ.
[03:07:06.700 --> 03:07:10.700]  You say that name around a Luciferian, or someone that's demon possessed.
[03:07:10.700 --> 03:07:16.700]  Or that is totally in opposition towards God, which by default all fallen mankind is.
[03:07:16.700 --> 03:07:18.700]  The sons in disobedience.
[03:07:19.700 --> 03:07:21.700]  But you gotta ask yourself, what is the equation?
[03:07:21.700 --> 03:07:24.700]  What is the intergalactic equation here?
[03:07:24.700 --> 03:07:28.700]  What is the equation of the universe when you ask yourself?
[03:07:28.700 --> 03:07:33.700]  Very basically, 5 plus 5 is 10, depending on who you ask.
[03:07:33.700 --> 03:07:36.700]  If you ask someone from the New World Order, the Deep State,
[03:07:36.700 --> 03:07:41.700]  someone from the realms of 1984 and that timeline in the multiverse,
[03:07:41.700 --> 03:07:45.700]  they'll tell you that 5 plus 5 equals 11, right?
[03:07:45.700 --> 03:07:49.700]  But in a normal world, where things are done accurately,
[03:07:49.700 --> 03:07:53.700]  and truth is told, and things are concluded according to truth,
[03:07:53.700 --> 03:07:57.700]  and reality is actually corresponding with what reality truly is,
[03:07:57.700 --> 03:08:03.700]  what is the intergalactic conclusion and calculation when you allow, alright,
[03:08:03.700 --> 03:08:08.700]  when you allow evil, and I'm talking pure evil,
[03:08:08.700 --> 03:08:14.700]  Luciferian, occult, pedophiles, groomers out in the open,
[03:08:14.700 --> 03:08:19.700]  murdering children, what do you think is the calculation?
[03:08:19.700 --> 03:08:25.700]  What is gonna be the end result to what people will calculate
[03:08:25.700 --> 03:08:31.700]  when all of evil is allowed to just be absolutely unleashed and let loose
[03:08:31.700 --> 03:08:34.700]  in their society, whether it's in the United States of America,
[03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:39.700]  whether it's in Europe, whether it's in different parts of the world,
[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:44.700]  East, West, you name it, when people clearly begin to identify that,
[03:08:44.700 --> 03:08:49.700]  hey, there is something evil out there that is controlling things
[03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:55.700]  behind the scenes, there are people that are puppets, that are agents
[03:08:55.700 --> 03:09:00.700]  of a system that seems to be in unison all together at once,
[03:09:00.700 --> 03:09:05.700]  same message, you know, we call them NPCs right now, right?
[03:09:05.700 --> 03:09:07.700]  We call them these, you know, these woke, tarred robots,
[03:09:07.700 --> 03:09:11.700]  these individuals that just take the next update or download
[03:09:11.700 --> 03:09:13.700]  whatever the New World Order says to believe.
[03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:16.700]  I believe in the current thing.
[03:09:16.700 --> 03:09:20.700]  We got words for that, but at the end of the day, it's the ancient,
[03:09:20.700 --> 03:09:25.700]  the ancient but still relevant story of what the Bible has unveiled
[03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:28.700]  to humanity of good versus evil.
[03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:31.700]  We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against powers,
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:36.700]  principalities, spiritual hosts of wickedness that are extremely advanced,
[03:09:36.700 --> 03:09:38.700]  intelligent.
[03:09:38.700 --> 03:09:42.700]  These individuals have been around longer than you and I have.
[03:09:42.700 --> 03:09:44.700]  They're ancient.
[03:09:44.700 --> 03:09:45.700]  They've studied humanity.
[03:09:45.700 --> 03:09:47.700]  They've watched humanity.
[03:09:47.700 --> 03:09:52.700]  They know, according to generations, just exactly how to manipulate people
[03:09:52.700 --> 03:09:56.700]  at the right time with the right things, with the right words.
[03:09:56.700 --> 03:09:59.700]  That's what Satan did to Jesus in the wilderness when he tried to tempt him,
[03:09:59.700 --> 03:10:04.700]  tempted him with everything and even laced some scripture with it as well.
[03:10:04.700 --> 03:10:06.700]  That's what a wolf in sheep's clothing is.
[03:10:06.700 --> 03:10:08.700]  Drew, what are you talking about?
[03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:12.700]  What I'm talking about is the conclusion, the intergalactic conclusion,
[03:10:12.700 --> 03:10:16.700]  all right, that we are experiencing this multidimensional universe
[03:10:16.700 --> 03:10:18.700]  that we all live in.
[03:10:18.700 --> 03:10:25.700]  When they begin to collide and people begin to get exposed to realities
[03:10:25.700 --> 03:10:30.700]  or the reality that the multidimensional world exists,
[03:10:30.700 --> 03:10:35.700]  that demons, spiritual hosts of wickedness are real
[03:10:35.700 --> 03:10:37.700]  and they not only function behind the scene
[03:10:37.700 --> 03:10:40.700]  because we live in a multidimensional world and universe,
[03:10:40.700 --> 03:10:43.700]  you can't see them, but in some cases they manifest,
[03:10:43.700 --> 03:10:47.700]  and in some cases they oppress human beings,
[03:10:47.700 --> 03:10:50.700]  and in some cases they possess human beings.
[03:10:50.700 --> 03:10:51.700]  You don't believe me?
[03:10:51.700 --> 03:10:53.700]  Take a trip to Haiti, buddy.
[03:10:53.700 --> 03:10:56.700]  Go live in Haiti for about a month and come back and tell me
[03:10:56.700 --> 03:11:00.700]  that spiritual hosts of wickedness are not real, all right?
[03:11:00.700 --> 03:11:04.700]  I always challenge people out there that think what I'm saying is a load of garbage,
[03:11:04.700 --> 03:11:07.700]  but that's one way to confirm the Bible to be authenticated
[03:11:07.700 --> 03:11:10.700]  when it talks about demons, okay?
[03:11:10.700 --> 03:11:15.700]  But also, people wake up to the reality when they begin to experience things like this.
[03:11:15.700 --> 03:11:18.700]  They wake up to the reality that evil is absolutely real
[03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:21.700]  when the Bible has prophesied thousands of years ago
[03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:25.700]  that there would be an established new world order,
[03:11:25.700 --> 03:11:28.700]  one world government, one world militarized system,
[03:11:28.700 --> 03:11:31.700]  one world economy,
[03:11:31.700 --> 03:11:35.700]  one world absolute dictatorial power
[03:11:35.700 --> 03:11:39.700]  with the advent of an anti-Christ, false prophet,
[03:11:39.700 --> 03:11:41.700]  all empowered by Lucifer,
[03:11:41.700 --> 03:11:44.700]  the Luciferian trinity, the ultimate showdown
[03:11:44.700 --> 03:11:46.700]  right before the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[03:11:46.700 --> 03:11:49.700]  How is it that all these things are beginning to develop?
[03:11:49.700 --> 03:11:51.700]  You got to sit there and ask yourself,
[03:11:51.700 --> 03:11:54.700]  multiple writers in the biblical text
[03:11:54.700 --> 03:11:57.700]  that knew of this, that spoke of it,
[03:11:57.700 --> 03:12:00.700]  that in some cases spoke different languages,
[03:12:00.700 --> 03:12:04.700]  lived in different generational time periods in the timeline of humanity,
[03:12:04.700 --> 03:12:11.700]  but still, that biblical thread of Bible prophecy is weaved perfectly.
[03:12:11.700 --> 03:12:14.700]  How? How? What a conspiracy theory, right?
[03:12:14.700 --> 03:12:16.700]  You want to talk about a conspiracy theory
[03:12:16.700 --> 03:12:20.700]  thinking that multiple writers, multiple books,
[03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:25.700]  different geographical locations, no internet, no radio,
[03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:29.700]  just somehow all conspired and communicated to weave
[03:12:29.700 --> 03:12:36.700]  the perfect, okay, the perfect biblical prophetic scriptures,
[03:12:36.700 --> 03:12:39.700]  all right, that all point to Jesus Christ,
[03:12:39.700 --> 03:12:42.700]  his first advent, his second advent,
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:45.700]  and also the precursor to the second coming,
[03:12:45.700 --> 03:12:47.700]  which is the advent of the Antichrist.
[03:12:47.700 --> 03:12:49.700]  How is it, my friend?
[03:12:49.700 --> 03:12:53.700]  How is it that multiple writers that did not know each other,
[03:12:53.700 --> 03:12:56.700]  lived in different geographical locations,
[03:12:56.700 --> 03:13:01.700]  different generations, they all point to the end?
[03:13:01.700 --> 03:13:05.700]  And how is it that here we are in 2023,
[03:13:05.700 --> 03:13:08.700]  thousands of years after these texts have been pinned down,
[03:13:08.700 --> 03:13:12.700]  we are starting to see these things come to fruition?
[03:13:12.700 --> 03:13:14.700]  Why? Because it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:18.700]  When you talk about believing in a conspiracy theory,
[03:13:18.700 --> 03:13:22.700]  the biggest lie of all humanity, that's a pretty wild one, man.
[03:13:22.700 --> 03:13:24.700]  You want to sit here?
[03:13:24.700 --> 03:13:28.700]  That's a pretty wild one to think that humans were that advanced
[03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:32.700]  to set something like that all up together.
[03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:34.700]  No, no, no, no.
[03:13:34.700 --> 03:13:37.700]  The confirmation is that the Holy Spirit
[03:13:37.700 --> 03:13:40.700]  has inspired the scriptures, Old and New Testament.
[03:13:40.700 --> 03:13:43.700]  That is why eschatology, which is Bible prophecy,
[03:13:43.700 --> 03:13:47.700]  things that were prophesied and came to fruition to the T,
[03:13:47.700 --> 03:13:49.700]  and things that are yet to come to fruition
[03:13:49.700 --> 03:13:52.700]  will come together to the T according to the Bible.
[03:13:52.700 --> 03:13:54.700]  And you've got to ask yourself,
[03:13:54.700 --> 03:13:58.700]  there are things that the prophets foretold that ended up happening,
[03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:00.700]  including things like Palm Sunday,
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:03.700]  the advent and first coming of Jesus Christ,
[03:14:03.700 --> 03:14:06.700]  which is a historical event.
[03:14:06.700 --> 03:14:08.700]  You can't deny that.
[03:14:08.700 --> 03:14:10.700]  And I always ask people this,
[03:14:10.700 --> 03:14:13.700]  how come in the first century church,
[03:14:13.700 --> 03:14:17.700]  after Christ was alive,
[03:14:17.700 --> 03:14:20.700]  was crucified, was buried,
[03:14:20.700 --> 03:14:22.700]  and he rose from the dead and he ascended?
[03:14:22.700 --> 03:14:24.700]  Why is it in the first century
[03:14:24.700 --> 03:14:29.700]  it is very hard to find people trying to deny the existence of Jesus Christ?
[03:14:29.700 --> 03:14:31.700]  Why? Want to know why?
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:33.700]  Because it was impossible.
[03:14:33.700 --> 03:14:36.700]  It was impossible, especially in the regions of Israel,
[03:14:37.700 --> 03:14:40.700]  Jerusalem at the time.
[03:14:40.700 --> 03:14:42.700]  The Romans could not deny.
[03:14:42.700 --> 03:14:45.700]  They just viewed Jesus Christ as a threat.
[03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:47.700]  It was just a ghost they were afraid of.
[03:14:47.700 --> 03:14:49.700]  They viewed Jesus Christ as an insurrectionist,
[03:14:49.700 --> 03:14:51.700]  a threat to the state,
[03:14:51.700 --> 03:14:54.700]  because he had a mass following publicly, thousands of people.
[03:14:54.700 --> 03:14:57.700]  You want to talk about followers?
[03:14:57.700 --> 03:15:00.700]  Imagine tens of thousands of people following you,
[03:15:00.700 --> 03:15:02.700]  walking around your city,
[03:15:02.700 --> 03:15:04.700]  because they believe in what you're saying.
[03:15:04.700 --> 03:15:05.700]  They've identified you as God,
[03:15:05.700 --> 03:15:07.700]  or they think there's something they can get out of you.
[03:15:07.700 --> 03:15:11.700]  The Romans saw that as an act of revolution against the state.
[03:15:11.700 --> 03:15:14.700]  Jesus Christ was the ultimate insurrectionist,
[03:15:14.700 --> 03:15:16.700]  according to the Romans.
[03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:17.700]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:15:17.700 --> 03:15:18.700]  What's the point, Drew?
[03:15:18.700 --> 03:15:20.700]  The point is,
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:23.700]  how can you deny that that did not exist,
[03:15:23.700 --> 03:15:25.700]  especially in the first century?
[03:15:25.700 --> 03:15:28.700]  No one tried to deny the existence of Jesus,
[03:15:28.700 --> 03:15:31.700]  because he's real.
[03:15:31.700 --> 03:15:35.700]  He's 100% an authentic, historical figure.
[03:15:35.700 --> 03:15:37.700]  And no one tried to deny his existence.
[03:15:37.700 --> 03:15:38.700]  In the first century,
[03:15:38.700 --> 03:15:42.700]  a lot of people were trying to disclaim or slander Christ
[03:15:42.700 --> 03:15:44.700]  and his works and his miracles.
[03:15:44.700 --> 03:15:45.700]  They said he was a magician,
[03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:47.700]  practicing dark magic,
[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:48.700]  and he shouldn't be trusted.
[03:15:48.700 --> 03:15:50.700]  It was all optical illusions.
[03:15:50.700 --> 03:15:52.700]  There's a reason for that.
[03:15:52.700 --> 03:15:53.700]  You waking up now?
[03:15:53.700 --> 03:15:54.700]  Good.
[03:15:54.700 --> 03:15:56.700]  We have a lot more when we come back from the break.
[03:15:56.700 --> 03:15:58.700]  Thousands of former Nazis
[03:15:58.700 --> 03:16:01.700]  went to work for the United States government.
[03:16:01.700 --> 03:16:03.700]  A flying disk has been found
[03:16:03.700 --> 03:16:05.700]  and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:16:05.700 --> 03:16:07.700]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:16:07.700 --> 03:16:09.700]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:16:09.700 --> 03:16:13.700]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:16:13.700 --> 03:16:15.700]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked
[03:16:15.700 --> 03:16:17.700]  by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[03:16:17.700 --> 03:16:21.700]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:16:21.700 --> 03:16:23.700]  They took the babies out of incubators
[03:16:23.700 --> 03:16:25.700]  and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:16:25.700 --> 03:16:27.700]  It's almost as if there were a plan in place.
[03:16:27.700 --> 03:16:29.700]  It just can't end.
[03:16:29.700 --> 03:16:31.700]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[03:16:31.700 --> 03:16:33.700]  That's, that's, that's...
[03:16:33.700 --> 03:16:35.700]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:16:35.700 --> 03:16:36.700]  They are nothing but distractions.
[03:16:36.700 --> 03:16:39.700]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[03:16:39.700 --> 03:16:41.700]  You silenced those voices.
[03:16:41.700 --> 03:16:45.700]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:16:45.700 --> 03:16:48.700]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[03:16:48.700 --> 03:16:52.700]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[03:16:56.700 --> 03:17:08.700]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food,
[03:17:08.700 --> 03:17:10.700]  but also your health supplements,
[03:17:10.700 --> 03:17:13.700]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[03:17:13.700 --> 03:17:15.700]  So support Infowars store.
[03:17:15.700 --> 03:17:18.700]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority,
[03:17:18.700 --> 03:17:20.700]  because you don't know, I don't know.
[03:17:20.700 --> 03:17:22.700]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is
[03:17:22.700 --> 03:17:24.700]  before midnight strikes.
[03:17:24.700 --> 03:17:29.700]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[03:17:29.700 --> 03:17:30.700]  Krill oil.
[03:17:30.700 --> 03:17:32.700]  What I'm watching right before my eyes
[03:17:32.700 --> 03:17:36.700]  is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[03:17:36.700 --> 03:17:37.700]  that will keep you alive.
[03:17:37.700 --> 03:17:39.700]  And I would urge everyone,
[03:17:39.700 --> 03:17:40.700]  maybe you don't take vitamins,
[03:17:40.700 --> 03:17:42.700]  maybe you don't take nutritional supplements,
[03:17:42.700 --> 03:17:43.700]  but the day will come.
[03:17:43.700 --> 03:17:46.700]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[03:17:46.700 --> 03:17:48.700]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[03:17:48.700 --> 03:17:50.700]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[03:17:50.700 --> 03:17:52.700]  As you're drinking filtered water,
[03:17:52.700 --> 03:17:53.700]  a lot of it will become demineralized.
[03:17:53.700 --> 03:17:56.700]  You have to have these products.
[03:17:56.700 --> 03:18:00.700]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners
[03:18:00.700 --> 03:18:03.700]  that have gone to Infowarsstore.com
[03:18:03.700 --> 03:18:05.700]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life,

[03:18:08.700 --> 03:18:11.700]  I am humbly, hand in hand,
[03:18:11.700 --> 03:18:13.700]  talking to the viewers and listeners
[03:18:13.700 --> 03:18:15.700]  that have tuned in, many of you for years,
[03:18:15.700 --> 03:18:17.700]  and never gone to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:17.700 --> 03:18:20.700]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[03:18:20.700 --> 03:18:22.700]  never actually go to Infowarsstore.com
[03:18:22.700 --> 03:18:24.700]  and never experienced these great products
[03:18:24.700 --> 03:18:25.700]  and never found the operation.
[03:18:25.700 --> 03:18:27.700]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article,
[03:18:27.700 --> 03:18:28.700]  you tell folks about the show.
[03:18:28.700 --> 03:18:30.700]  That's great, and I thank you.
[03:18:30.700 --> 03:18:31.700]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:18:31.700 --> 03:18:33.700]  Plus, we've got really great products
[03:18:33.700 --> 03:18:34.700]  that do amazing things for people,

[03:18:37.700 --> 03:18:39.700]  and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide
[03:18:39.700 --> 03:18:40.700]  and our real red pill.
[03:18:40.700 --> 03:18:42.700]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[03:18:42.700 --> 03:18:43.700]  They keep us on air.
[03:18:43.700 --> 03:18:45.700]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:18:45.700 --> 03:18:47.700]  So get off the bench, get in the game,
[03:18:47.700 --> 03:18:48.700]  step to the plate,
[03:18:48.700 --> 03:18:51.700]  and go to Infowarsstore.com right now
[03:18:51.700 --> 03:18:53.700]  and get these great Infowars products
[03:18:53.700 --> 03:18:54.700]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:56.700 --> 03:18:59.700]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third
[03:18:59.700 --> 03:19:02.700]  most deadly acid on earth,
[03:19:02.700 --> 03:19:04.700]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[03:19:04.700 --> 03:19:08.700]  This is a psychotic death cult, period,
[03:19:08.700 --> 03:19:10.700]  case closed, out to get you and your family.
[03:19:10.700 --> 03:19:12.700]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[03:19:12.700 --> 03:19:15.700]  made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group,
[03:19:15.700 --> 03:19:17.700]  that's been around about 15 years,
[03:19:17.700 --> 03:19:18.700]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:19:18.700 --> 03:19:20.700]  They went out, hired engineers,
[03:19:20.700 --> 03:19:21.700]  reverse engineered the fancy,
[03:19:21.700 --> 03:19:23.700]  best water filter system out there
[03:19:23.700 --> 03:19:24.700]  that sells for twice the price,
[03:19:24.700 --> 03:19:28.700]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:19:28.700 --> 03:19:30.700]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[03:19:30.700 --> 03:19:31.700]  thousands of chemicals.
[03:19:31.700 --> 03:19:33.700]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:19:33.700 --> 03:19:34.700]  There's four or five other filters out there
[03:19:34.700 --> 03:19:35.700]  that are just as good.
[03:19:35.700 --> 03:19:38.700]  We sell the very best, highest grade
[03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:39.700]  water filtration system
[03:19:39.700 --> 03:19:41.700]  for half the price of a leading competitor.
[03:19:41.700 --> 03:19:44.700]  And the media says we're bad and a cult
[03:19:44.700 --> 03:19:46.700]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:19:46.700 --> 03:19:48.700]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:19:48.700 --> 03:19:49.700]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:19:49.700 --> 03:19:51.700]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:19:51.700 --> 03:19:52.700]  The point is,
[03:19:52.700 --> 03:19:54.700]  you get the filters at Infowarshore.com.
[03:19:54.700 --> 03:19:55.700]  They're discounted right now.
[03:19:55.700 --> 03:19:56.700]  Finally back in stock.
[03:19:56.700 --> 03:19:59.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[03:19:59.700 --> 03:20:01.700]  of the New World Order.
[03:20:01.700 --> 03:20:03.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:18.119]  You know, Luke Rudowsky said it best at the end of the third hour, you know, seek the truth
[03:20:18.119 --> 03:20:20.119]  for yourself.
[03:20:20.119 --> 03:20:23.920]  Find these things out to be true on your own.
[03:20:23.920 --> 03:20:26.039]  No one can find it for you.
[03:20:26.039 --> 03:20:28.060]  No one can do it for you.
[03:20:28.060 --> 03:20:32.279]  No one can think for you because once you allow people to think for you, that's when
[03:20:32.279 --> 03:20:35.560]  the New World Order steps in and says, well, here's the next algorithm.
[03:20:35.560 --> 03:20:36.720]  You want VR?
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:37.880]  You want AR?
[03:20:37.880 --> 03:20:43.000]  You want this new microchip in your brain so we could just download whatever it is we
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:44.480]  can think up for you?
[03:20:44.480 --> 03:20:47.279]  Because we're the fact checkers.
[03:20:47.279 --> 03:20:50.199]  We're the ones who have the accurate truth.
[03:20:50.199 --> 03:20:51.400]  You can't do it on your own.
[03:20:51.400 --> 03:20:54.760]  We are the AI technocratic gods.
[03:20:54.760 --> 03:20:57.400]  That's what these people believe they are.
[03:20:57.400 --> 03:20:59.600]  You know, people ask, how do I find faith?
[03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:00.760]  How do I find this?
[03:21:00.760 --> 03:21:03.600]  How do I obtain what you're talking about?
[03:21:03.600 --> 03:21:06.840]  You know, that is the beginning.
[03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:09.960]  Everyone is given a measure of faith according to the Bible.
[03:21:09.960 --> 03:21:16.600]  That desire is inside of you because God put that desire for the hunger and the thirst
[03:21:16.600 --> 03:21:20.920]  and the search for truth within you.
[03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:23.840]  Where do you think that comes from?
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:27.199]  You know, I'm here to tell you, I'm just the messenger man.
[03:21:27.199 --> 03:21:29.920]  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:32.720]  Go spend some time in the scriptures.
[03:21:32.720 --> 03:21:37.840]  And listen, if you're ADD like me, you got to ask God, please help me to focus.
[03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:38.840]  And he will.
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:40.880]  And you'll see very true.
[03:21:40.880 --> 03:21:47.199]  You'll find yourselves obsessed of communing with God and reading the God breath scriptures.
[03:21:47.199 --> 03:21:52.520]  Not to be religious and holier than thou, but the reality of how true this really is.
[03:21:52.520 --> 03:21:58.080]  You know, that's why we have an entire generation of people waking up to the reality of a higher
[03:21:58.080 --> 03:21:59.080]  power.
[03:21:59.240 --> 03:22:03.720]  You know, you got to define what that means, because I'll tell you one thing.
[03:22:03.720 --> 03:22:10.160]  People are waking up to the reality that Lucifer is real and they want to choose his side.
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:12.400]  Look around you, look at the culture.
[03:22:12.400 --> 03:22:16.800]  People are waking up to the reality that he will take you to the pinnacle of the mountain
[03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:21.720]  and give you everything that you want and desire all power, all money, all clout, you name
[03:22:21.720 --> 03:22:22.720]  it.
[03:22:22.720 --> 03:22:26.000]  If you just get on your knees and worship him, how do you worship him?
[03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:27.960]  You deny Christ.
[03:22:27.960 --> 03:22:32.560]  You deny everything that has to do with Jesus reality.
[03:22:32.560 --> 03:22:38.000]  You bow down to degeneracy, immorality in the new world order.
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:40.520]  You're a Luciferian by default.
[03:22:40.520 --> 03:22:44.119]  You're pledging your allegiance to Satan.
[03:22:44.119 --> 03:22:47.440]  And I want to encourage people on the flip side, people are waking up to the reality
[03:22:47.440 --> 03:22:50.900]  of the spiritual reality of things.
[03:22:50.900 --> 03:22:56.480]  Because when you get exposed to evil, when you get exposed to pedophiles being normalized
[03:22:56.480 --> 03:22:59.480]  in society, maps, minor attracted persons, right?
[03:22:59.480 --> 03:23:03.160]  All this garbage, youth attracted persons.
[03:23:03.160 --> 03:23:07.199]  When all this is getting normalized and the so-called trans people that are not real,
[03:23:07.199 --> 03:23:11.840]  they're just homosexuals start running around and murdering little Christian kids and laughing
[03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:12.840]  about it.
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:16.440]  And the mainstream media turns around and defends the kids and the adults that were
[03:23:16.440 --> 03:23:17.440]  murdered.
[03:23:17.440 --> 03:23:22.520]  When the United States of America has been murdering and slaughtering babies in the womb
[03:23:22.520 --> 03:23:27.840]  and outside of the womb, offering them up to Molech, which is just another form of
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:34.960]  worship to the devil, a idol offering up blood, human sacrifice.
[03:23:34.960 --> 03:23:40.400]  When that's happening on a daily basis, you're going to start to see some real serious demonic
[03:23:40.400 --> 03:23:43.160]  activity begin to pop out.
[03:23:43.160 --> 03:23:46.359]  And I don't say that like, yes, I was right.
[03:23:46.359 --> 03:23:47.960]  But I will say, yes, God is right.
[03:23:47.960 --> 03:23:53.199]  And he warns every single one of us that we have the option to listen or we have the option
[03:23:53.199 --> 03:23:57.960]  to reject and not listen and not apply anything.
[03:23:57.960 --> 03:24:00.520]  And then we get into situations like this.
[03:24:00.520 --> 03:24:04.320]  So I encourage people, seek the truth for yourself.
[03:24:04.320 --> 03:24:06.400]  There's a reason why you've been selected.
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:10.539]  You are hand selected for this generation, my friend.
[03:24:10.539 --> 03:24:11.560]  Look around you.
[03:24:11.560 --> 03:24:13.560]  Look at the advances of Satanism.
[03:24:13.560 --> 03:24:15.920]  Look at the advances of the World Economic Forum.
[03:24:15.920 --> 03:24:20.680]  Look at the advances of Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, these Satanists and Luciferians in
[03:24:20.680 --> 03:24:26.320]  the mainstream media, in the culture with their lies and propaganda and their literal
[03:24:26.320 --> 03:24:30.920]  agendas to destroy the West and anyone that loves God.
[03:24:30.920 --> 03:24:32.960]  This is all about God.
[03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:36.840]  People want to say the United States of America was founded with Christian values.
[03:24:36.840 --> 03:24:40.480]  Then what do you think this whole dismantling of the West is all about, you guys?
[03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:44.840]  You see, that's just the surface level argument.
[03:24:44.840 --> 03:24:45.840]  This is about America.
[03:24:46.760 --> 03:24:48.199]  This is about good versus evil.
[03:24:48.199 --> 03:24:50.320]  And yes, America was founded.
[03:24:50.320 --> 03:24:55.480]  We have these values of Christianity and obviously they've been subverted and attacked.
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:59.560]  That is why it's more offensive for a little kid in kindergarten to be told, thou shall
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:01.400]  not kill from the Ten Commandments.
[03:25:01.400 --> 03:25:03.520]  But it's not offensive, okay, at all.
[03:25:03.520 --> 03:25:08.240]  If you want to groom a child and get a pedophile in there and have drag queen pedo time with
[03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:09.240]  all the kindergartners.
[03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:11.240]  No, that's not offensive.
[03:25:11.240 --> 03:25:15.720]  Quoting thou shall not kill to a little kid is offensive.
[03:25:16.600 --> 03:25:20.800]  I'm so sick of people sitting here and saying, oh, no, no, no, just, no, that's too much.
[03:25:20.800 --> 03:25:21.800]  That's too much.
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:22.800]  It's a yeah.
[03:25:22.800 --> 03:25:23.800]  Keep saying that.
[03:25:23.800 --> 03:25:27.680]  And the pedophiles are saying, yeah, keep saying that you conservative.
[03:25:27.680 --> 03:25:29.960]  Keep saying that you libtard moron.
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:30.960]  Keep saying that.
[03:25:30.960 --> 03:25:31.960]  Oh, yes.
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:32.960]  Keep saying that.
[03:25:32.960 --> 03:25:33.960]  So we can advance.
[03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:39.640]  Hijack your children, molest and rape your children, because that is how Satan is functioning.
[03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:50.700]  When good men and good women are unwilling to say anything and do anything when it comes to dealing with some serious evil,
[03:25:50.700 --> 03:25:57.700]  then there's only one result, my friend. Evil will advance and dominate that society.
[03:25:57.700 --> 03:26:00.700]  Absolutely dominate that society.
[03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:05.700]  The stuff with Tucker Carlson is insane, isn't it? Perfect example.
[03:26:05.700 --> 03:26:10.700]  I personally think the deep state moved very strategically against Tucker.
[03:26:10.700 --> 03:26:17.700]  Tucker's going to be alright. Tucker's a superstar. I would not be here without Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones.
[03:26:17.700 --> 03:26:22.700]  There's a select handful of men that have allowed me to be in the position I am today.
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:25.700]  Tucker Carlson is definitely one of them.
[03:26:25.700 --> 03:26:28.700]  But you really think about the timeline, like really think about this.
[03:26:28.700 --> 03:26:32.700]  Kevin McCarthy says we're going to hand over, right?
[03:26:32.700 --> 03:26:36.700]  Right now Kevin McCarthy comes out and says we're going to hand over the J6 tapes to who?
[03:26:36.700 --> 03:26:39.700]  To Fox News and Tucker Carlson.
[03:26:39.700 --> 03:26:44.700]  And immediately it was like open game.
[03:26:44.700 --> 03:26:48.700]  The entire deep state on both sides, the unit party, they all went after Tucker.
[03:26:48.700 --> 03:26:56.700]  Fox, Chuck Schumer came out and went after Murdoch, went after everyone at Fox at the top and said you need to de-platform him.
[03:26:56.700 --> 03:27:01.700]  Fox needs to take care of this. There's no way you can allow Tucker Carlson to put out these exposés.
[03:27:01.700 --> 03:27:10.700]  AOC came out and said what? We need federal intervention when it comes to Tucker and his incitement of violence.
[03:27:10.700 --> 03:27:19.700]  All because of the J6 exposé. Exposing Ray Epps, exposing the J6 committee and their so-called narrative shattered it.
[03:27:19.700 --> 03:27:22.700]  I personally wanted the J6 tapes to be leaked like a WikiLeaks style.
[03:27:22.700 --> 03:27:26.700]  I think a lot of you guys agree with that. But Tucker only had an hour.
[03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:30.700]  Can only really do so much in an hour when it comes to exposing something like that.
[03:27:30.700 --> 03:27:36.700]  But isn't it interesting? I don't know, man. I don't believe in the two-party system.
[03:27:36.700 --> 03:27:41.700]  I think it's a mirage. I think it's to get us thinking only one way.
[03:27:41.700 --> 03:27:48.700]  And it's the perfect way for subverters and wolves in sheep's clothing to get you to think that they're on your side, isn't it?
[03:27:48.700 --> 03:27:53.700]  You got to discern people's behavior. You shall know a tree by their fruit, my friend.
[03:27:53.700 --> 03:28:00.700]  Not by their jersey. Not by their robe. Not by their title. Not even by the words that come out of their mouths.
[03:28:00.700 --> 03:28:06.700]  You shall know them by their fruit, their behaviors, what they support, what they have been supporting for years.
[03:28:06.700 --> 03:28:14.700]  Because I can say one thing and be living a totally different lifestyle and throwing my money into something that has nothing to do with what I just claimed I believe.
[03:28:15.700 --> 03:28:19.700]  I think Tucker was set up. This is my opinion.
[03:28:19.700 --> 03:28:26.700]  I think the RINOs knew that Tucker would take the J6 tapes, and it was the perfect way.
[03:28:26.700 --> 03:28:30.700]  It was the perfect way. They handed it to him.
[03:28:30.700 --> 03:28:36.700]  He did the exposés like he should, but I think the Deep State knew all along, left and right,
[03:28:36.700 --> 03:28:43.700]  that this would be the smoking gun, the silver bullet to shoot in the back of Tucker Carlson's head
[03:28:43.700 --> 03:28:47.700]  because he is the primetime host with millions.
[03:28:47.700 --> 03:28:50.700]  I got a lot more on this theory. This is just my opinion.
[03:28:50.700 --> 03:28:53.700]  When we come back from the break, I know it's getting juicy, so don't go anywhere, you guys.
[03:28:53.700 --> 03:28:55.700]  Share the links. We need you to do it now.
[03:28:57.700 --> 03:29:01.700]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:29:01.700 --> 03:29:06.700]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:29:06.700 --> 03:29:11.700]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:29:12.700 --> 03:29:15.700]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:29:15.700 --> 03:29:20.700]  When we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:29:20.700 --> 03:29:24.700]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:29:24.700 --> 03:29:28.700]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:29:28.700 --> 03:29:34.700]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:29:34.700 --> 03:29:37.700]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[03:29:37.700 --> 03:29:41.700]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:29:41.700 --> 03:29:46.700]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:29:46.700 --> 03:29:50.700]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:50.700 --> 03:29:55.700]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:29:55.700 --> 03:29:56.700]  Please take action now.
[03:29:56.700 --> 03:30:04.700]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our children drinking that.
[03:30:04.700 --> 03:30:10.700]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[03:30:10.700 --> 03:30:15.700]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour group.
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:18.700]  It's been around about 15 years. It became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:30:18.700 --> 03:30:24.700]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price,
[03:30:24.700 --> 03:30:28.700]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:30:28.700 --> 03:30:31.700]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:30:31.700 --> 03:30:35.700]  But you can go pay two or three times. There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:30:35.700 --> 03:30:40.700]  We sell the very best highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[03:30:40.700 --> 03:30:46.700]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:30:46.700 --> 03:30:49.700]  You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:30:49.700 --> 03:30:51.700]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:30:51.700 --> 03:30:53.700]  The point is you get the filters at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:53.700 --> 03:30:56.700]  They're discounted right now. Finally back in stock.
[03:30:57.700 --> 03:31:03.700]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsStore.com
[03:31:03.700 --> 03:31:09.700]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[03:31:09.700 --> 03:31:15.700]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years,
[03:31:15.700 --> 03:31:17.700]  and never gone to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:17.700 --> 03:31:23.700]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsStore.com
[03:31:23.700 --> 03:31:26.700]  and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[03:31:26.700 --> 03:31:29.700]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:31:29.700 --> 03:31:30.700]  That's great, and I thank you.
[03:31:30.700 --> 03:31:32.700]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:31:32.700 --> 03:31:35.700]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people,
[03:31:35.700 --> 03:31:40.700]  like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our Sleep Aid and our Nitrogen Oxide and our Real Red Pill.
[03:31:40.700 --> 03:31:43.700]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[03:31:43.700 --> 03:31:45.700]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:31:45.700 --> 03:31:47.700]  So get off the bench. Get in the game.
[03:31:47.700 --> 03:31:51.700]  Step to the plate and go to InfoWarsStore.com right now
[03:31:51.700 --> 03:31:54.700]  and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:22.700 --> 03:32:25.700]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:32:25.700 --> 03:32:27.700]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:32:27.700 --> 03:32:32.700]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:32:32.700 --> 03:32:36.700]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:32:36.700 --> 03:32:39.700]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[03:32:39.700 --> 03:32:41.700]  please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[03:32:41.700 --> 03:32:43.700]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:32:43.700 --> 03:32:46.700]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[03:32:46.700 --> 03:32:49.700]  while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:49.700 --> 03:32:51.700]  So don't procrastinate. Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:51.700 --> 03:32:53.700]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air.
[03:32:53.700 --> 03:32:56.700]  And never submit to these tyrants.
[03:33:05.400 --> 03:33:16.119]  You know, it's as simple as this, this is how the Uniparty functions.
[03:33:16.119 --> 03:33:18.640]  Deep State says, how do we take down Tucker Carlson?
[03:33:18.640 --> 03:33:23.080]  All right, let's give him the J6 tapes.
[03:33:23.080 --> 03:33:29.039]  Fresh meat, immediately Chuck Schumer on the left, AOC on the left, called for the takedown
[03:33:29.039 --> 03:33:30.880]  of Tucker Carlson.
[03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:34.000]  Went after Fox, went after Rupert Murdoch.
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:35.000]  He bent the knee.
[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:41.960]  A couple months later, here we are, Tucker Carlson is gone, all right, off of Fox News,
[03:33:41.960 --> 03:33:44.480]  but not gone entirely.
[03:33:44.480 --> 03:33:49.119]  That man posted that video last night, did you guys notice his video he posted on Twitter
[03:33:49.119 --> 03:33:50.119]  last night?
[03:33:50.119 --> 03:33:53.480]  It was at 8 p.m. Eastern.
[03:33:53.480 --> 03:33:54.760]  That's his prime time, man.
[03:33:54.760 --> 03:34:01.000]  So you know, Tucker's not going anywhere, man, that guy has a lot, a lot coming, man.
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:02.199]  Everyone could see it, everyone could feel it.
[03:34:02.199 --> 03:34:07.720]  I think it's going to be incredible, because I like in the video how Tucker took shots at
[03:34:07.720 --> 03:34:08.720]  both sides.
[03:34:08.720 --> 03:34:09.720]  That's what we need right now.
[03:34:09.720 --> 03:34:14.520]  We need someone that is just coming out, I want to see a Tucker Carlson unleashed, right?
[03:34:14.520 --> 03:34:19.039]  But look how they took him down, and then look at the response, okay?
[03:34:19.039 --> 03:34:24.640]  You can always tell by the response when they take their victory laps.
[03:34:24.640 --> 03:34:30.920]  Look at the victory laps that were taken when Alex Jones got deplatformed and Infowars.
[03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:35.080]  The far left and the globalists all took their victory laps, they all started slandering
[03:34:35.080 --> 03:34:39.840]  all the guys, Alex, Owen, Harrison, you name it, everyone involved.
[03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:43.779]  Because once they censor you, you have no voice, you have no platform to come out and
[03:34:43.779 --> 03:34:45.440]  defend yourself.
[03:34:45.440 --> 03:34:48.720]  And then everyone on the so-called right that claims free speech, no one wanted to
[03:34:48.720 --> 03:34:53.000]  touch Infowars, it was like they had leprosy, you guys remember that?
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:57.520]  Fast forward a few years later, everyone was trying to warn everyone else, you saw everyone
[03:34:57.520 --> 03:34:58.520]  getting banned.
[03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:04.199]  You name it, okay, everyone was getting hit out there on big tech, and the writing was
[03:35:04.199 --> 03:35:05.920]  on the wall.
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:10.400]  President Donald J. Trump, he didn't want to listen, he got banned off of Twitter and
[03:35:10.400 --> 03:35:13.080]  Facebook and you name it, right?
[03:35:13.080 --> 03:35:19.279]  No one is untouchable unless you are an agent of Lucifer and you're useful for the moment,
[03:35:19.279 --> 03:35:22.340]  and then even when he's done with you, they throw you overboard.
[03:35:22.340 --> 03:35:27.039]  Look what they did to Don Lemon, the guy that says all white people are bad but is at home
[03:35:27.039 --> 03:35:38.080]  sleeping with a white guy every single night, because, yeah, sodomy, oh gosh, anyways, the
[03:35:38.080 --> 03:35:42.520]  point is, this is how the deep state functions.
[03:35:42.520 --> 03:35:46.720]  They take down Tucker and you look at the celebrations, the Pentagon, the Pentagon,
[03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:55.720]  you guys, the Pentagon is coming out and showing their appreciation and how they approve the
[03:35:55.720 --> 03:35:59.199]  takedown of Tucker Carlson out of Fox News.
[03:35:59.199 --> 03:36:00.199]  Why?
[03:36:00.199 --> 03:36:05.680]  Because Tucker was too mean and he called out our great military for being too woke.
[03:36:05.680 --> 03:36:13.720]  Well, you got the United States Army pushing all this CRT, inclusive diversity garbage,
[03:36:13.720 --> 03:36:18.160]  you could be a drag queen, oh, you could just be totally, like, it's sodomized in the military
[03:36:18.160 --> 03:36:22.359]  and that's awesome, yeah, that's what matters.
[03:36:22.359 --> 03:36:28.279]  As if you go to war, and shout out to all the veterans, man, as if you go to war on
[03:36:28.279 --> 03:36:34.320]  the other side of the globe or here on foreign land if we had to defend, as if what matters
[03:36:34.320 --> 03:36:40.400]  to your enemy is whether you're down with sodomy or not, whether you're inclusive or
[03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:48.440]  tolerant to the trans mentally ill that belong in the asylums, as if they care whether you're
[03:36:48.440 --> 03:36:54.840]  inclusive to, like, who they are, are you being nice, are you okay, did I shoot you
[03:36:54.840 --> 03:36:55.840]  too hard?
[03:36:55.840 --> 03:37:01.320]  Oh, no, no, no, you could shoot me, but just don't offend me, you could shoot me, this
[03:37:01.320 --> 03:37:06.400]  is a war, you could shoot me, but just don't offend me with your words, because your words
[03:37:06.400 --> 03:37:13.240]  are so much more powerful than an actual, like, bullet in my head during a war, it makes
[03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:14.240]  no sense.
[03:37:15.039 --> 03:37:18.520]  And of course the Pentagon is going to come out and say something like that, because the
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:23.680]  deep state has infiltrated everything, you name it, the Pentagon, the Marines, the United
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:29.400]  States military, the Army, the CIA, the FBI, obviously politics, the Republican Party,
[03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:38.039]  the Democrat Party, you name it, these proxies and agents are in everything, education, science,
[03:37:38.039 --> 03:37:45.279]  so-called health, you name it, these people are there, but there's a consequence.
[03:37:45.279 --> 03:37:51.640]  Remember Darcy, CNN's Darcy, guy that's, like, so totally afraid and cucked out whenever,
[03:37:51.640 --> 03:37:57.960]  like, Alex Jones is around, well, he actually said something pretty interesting for once,
[03:37:57.960 --> 03:38:04.320]  Fox News viewership is collapsing among 25 and 54-year-old age demographics after Tucker
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:07.920]  Carlson's firing, this is Breitbart, well, yeah, of course.
[03:38:08.359 --> 03:38:12.680]  What I just get done saying in the past two or three segments, people are starting to
[03:38:12.680 --> 03:38:20.779]  wake up to these evil powers that are in existence and they're fed up, Fox, this is probably
[03:38:20.779 --> 03:38:25.760]  arguably one of their biggest mistakes that they've ever made, why?
[03:38:25.760 --> 03:38:30.440]  Because they're not of us, that's why, they want to be a part of the New World Order,
[03:38:30.440 --> 03:38:34.240]  they want to take their orders from the deep state, they don't want to oppose Chuck Schumer,
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:37.920]  they don't want to oppose Nancy Pelosi, they don't want to oppose the deep state New World
[03:38:37.920 --> 03:38:42.000]  Order that is on the hill in Washington.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  Why do you think, look at AOC's response, literally took to Instagram, took to Instagram
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:53.400]  to tell all her followers that deplatforming works and it's important, that's a direct
[03:38:53.400 --> 03:38:59.920]  quote from a so-called United States Congresswoman, all right, that is obviously a self-proclaimed
[03:38:59.920 --> 03:39:09.920]  socialist that has lost her mind, AOC is so, she's very powerful, because on one end,
[03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:15.680]  you could roast her, but she's also powerful because her following just believes everything
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:21.480]  she says, yes, she's a total woke-tard and a moron, doesn't correspond with reality,
[03:39:21.480 --> 03:39:25.600]  but those are the types of people the New World Order needs, because they influence
[03:39:25.680 --> 03:39:32.000]  the millions of other woke-tard, mindless losers and NPCs, that's what a useful idiot is.
[03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:38.400]  But of course, of course, AOC is going to come out and literally celebrate the fact
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:42.000]  that Tucker Carlson just got taken down because she was calling for it.
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:43.680]  Oh, and then she came out and said, what did she say?
[03:39:43.680 --> 03:39:48.279]  She said, oh, because the majority of my death threats came from that man, the majority of
[03:39:48.279 --> 03:39:53.800]  those deaths, it's like, dude, you are a public figure, a US politician that's installed,
[03:39:53.800 --> 03:40:00.440]  people are going to hate you, all right, but they can't handle it, they can't handle it at all.
[03:40:02.279 --> 03:40:08.920]  I mean, really think about it, the timing was perfect, and I don't say that like I support it,
[03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:14.760]  but it makes sense to me when you connect all the dots, you look at it all, right in front of you,
[03:40:14.760 --> 03:40:19.000]  big screen right in front of you, like you're in the command center in Star Wars, and you're
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:22.359]  seeing everything right in front of you, and you're seeing everything come together and how
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:28.840]  listen, the New World Order is very organized, they move very strategically, they do play chess,
[03:40:30.279 --> 03:40:36.119]  they don't, listen, they don't sit there and do things without strategically thinking about
[03:40:36.119 --> 03:40:41.240]  what is it that they want to accomplish through this action, because there's a goal and an end
[03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:46.760]  game to all of it, what do you think end game is? All right, with Alex Jones's documentary,
[03:40:46.760 --> 03:40:50.840]  what do you think that whole thing is about? The end game is for a specific reason,
[03:40:51.720 --> 03:40:56.840]  and there are different checkpoints, different goals throughout all human history, where the
[03:40:56.840 --> 03:41:02.520]  devil is inserting and removing different proxies and agents that belong to him in order to push
[03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:09.720]  this anti-Christ agenda forward entirely. And you know, one of Tucker Carlson's so-called
[03:41:09.720 --> 03:41:17.880]  producers is suing him for sexism. You guys see that video? Oh, his producer, Justin Wells,
[03:41:18.359 --> 03:41:22.600]  him and Tucker, they ruined my life, they ruined me, they ruined me.
[03:41:23.160 --> 03:41:27.560]  Just this like, cucked out woman, it's like, what's wrong with you? Like, for real,
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:33.320]  what is wrong with, oh, Justin Wells and Tucker Carlson ruined me, they're misogynistic,
[03:41:33.320 --> 03:41:37.160]  they're sexists, oh, and they're anti-Semitic, it's always those three, right?
[03:41:38.119 --> 03:41:43.400]  It's always those three. You're misogynistic and sexist and anti-Semitic,
[03:41:44.199 --> 03:41:47.720]  because I'm a cucked out woman. It's like, dude, why did you get into politics?
[03:41:48.360 --> 03:41:53.400]  Why? If you don't have thick skin, what are you doing getting into politics?
[03:41:53.400 --> 03:42:00.680]  What are you doing? The world of politics is not for cucks in safe spaces, all right?
[03:42:00.680 --> 03:42:06.199]  When you're dealing with evil demonic powers, when you're dealing with aggressive personalities,
[03:42:06.199 --> 03:42:11.720]  when you're dealing with people that are quite literally narcissistic psychopaths that want
[03:42:11.720 --> 03:42:18.920]  nothing but power and fame and glory, come on, dude, this ain't for you, obviously.
[03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:26.279]  Go back to Chuck E. Cheese. Go back to Chuck E. Cheese, you loser, or I don't know,
[03:42:26.279 --> 03:42:32.360]  just maybe just go to one of them gay bars where all the woke white women are taking their babies,
[03:42:32.360 --> 03:42:36.840]  you know? They're taking their babies and bouncing them at the drag queen pedo times
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:41.880]  with all the babies there with a bunch of mentally ill homosexuals claiming to be trans,
[03:42:41.880 --> 03:42:47.240]  just helicoptering their genitals over and over and over again. Yeah, that's where you belong,
[03:42:47.240 --> 03:42:50.840]  all right? That's where you belong, because you tolerate the pedophiles.
[03:42:50.840 --> 03:42:54.840]  Oh, but Tucker Carlson and Justin Welles, they hurt my feelings.
[03:42:57.160 --> 03:43:01.800]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:05.160]  Carlson and take him off the air. People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever
[03:43:05.160 --> 03:43:09.320]  happened. They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only had Tucker Carlson on the air
[03:43:09.320 --> 03:43:12.439]  because they believed they could control him, but as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[03:43:12.439 --> 03:43:18.039]  he was taken off the air. It's the same thing with Infowars, but Infowars is not owned by Fox
[03:43:18.039 --> 03:43:24.119]  or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our

[03:43:58.360 --> 03:44:03.560]  on the border exposing the cartels and coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some
[03:44:03.560 --> 03:44:07.880]  American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero
[03:44:07.880 --> 03:44:12.039]  of a massive chemical spill. Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered
[03:44:12.039 --> 03:44:17.480]  that for a second? No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the
[03:44:17.480 --> 03:44:22.360]  truth, and again, I have Infowars to thank for that. Looking back on the day I was able to ask
[03:44:22.360 --> 03:44:28.119]  President Donald Trump two questions, I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained
[03:44:28.119 --> 03:44:33.240]  under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team. I really do credit that as to why I'm able to
[03:44:34.119 --> 03:44:39.400]  get these types of clips, because Alex's whole mentality was go where the story is,
[03:44:39.400 --> 03:44:44.199]  go where the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity,
[03:44:44.199 --> 03:44:47.640]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people,
[03:44:47.640 --> 03:44:52.199]  and I really do credit Alex for really instilling that within me early on in my career.

[03:45:51.800 --> 03:46:01.480]  more strength, more energy. In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic
[03:46:01.480 --> 03:46:08.199]  fluoride gases into the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get sick. Laws were enacted
[03:46:08.199 --> 03:46:15.080]  to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[03:46:15.080 --> 03:46:20.760]  still highly toxic but containable. Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[03:46:20.760 --> 03:46:25.880]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[03:46:25.880 --> 03:46:31.160]  was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the
[03:46:31.160 --> 03:46:38.439]  time. And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated, industrial waste product
[03:46:38.439 --> 03:46:44.600]  and dumping it into our drinking water. Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and
[03:46:44.600 --> 03:46:50.520]  other disease. With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy
[03:46:50.520 --> 03:46:55.160]  to this madness. Available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:46:57.720 --> 03:47:05.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.500 --> 03:47:17.680]  Well, the war that Disney is waging against you and your children, mom and dad, is only
[03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:23.460]  heating up. Of course, they're going to sue Governor Ron DeSantis. Of course, they're
[03:47:23.460 --> 03:47:28.500]  going to go after Florida and anyone that's kind of, you know, trying to make a stand
[03:47:28.500 --> 03:47:33.700]  against groomers and pedophilia. But of course, Disney is going to turn around and say, well,
[03:47:33.700 --> 03:47:43.580]  this is just the government coming after us. Well, like I said, always take a look at
[03:47:43.580 --> 03:47:49.140]  people's responses. You know, whether it's the government, whether it's humanity, whether
[03:47:49.140 --> 03:47:58.820]  it's parents, I think anyone and everyone should protect children from groomers and
[03:47:58.820 --> 03:48:04.980]  pedophiles, okay? Because, you know, Disney openly comes out. They came out and said we
[03:48:04.980 --> 03:48:10.180]  have a not-so-secret gay and queer agenda, and we are intentionally targeting your children
[03:48:10.180 --> 03:48:17.260]  with all our homosexuality and degeneracy. Why? Why? Why would they want to do that?
[03:48:17.260 --> 03:48:24.140]  And why is it that Disney sided with the devil and the Skittle people when it came to, you
[03:48:24.140 --> 03:48:32.140]  know, a teacher should, you know, it is homophobic to not allow a gay teacher to have a private
[03:48:32.140 --> 03:48:37.020]  relationship with your child, mom or dad. That's homophobic if you don't allow that.
[03:48:37.020 --> 03:48:42.860]  You're not letting us say gay. No, we're protecting children from pedophiles and groomers,
[03:48:42.860 --> 03:48:46.860]  you sick, disgusting degenerate. Can you not get with that? Whether you're on the left or the
[03:48:46.860 --> 03:48:50.700]  right or claim to be a conservative, but you're really a conservative. You claim to be on the
[03:48:50.700 --> 03:48:56.700]  right and clear. Listen, people sit here and claim that they have these conservative Christian values,
[03:48:56.700 --> 03:49:01.340]  but they are far from them. Whenever you throw it in their face, whenever they get around a
[03:49:01.340 --> 03:49:06.860]  real Christian conservative and we start really saying some base stuff, they get all triggered
[03:49:06.860 --> 03:49:13.340]  and you're being too mean. And it's like, dude, dude, go watch, you know, go watch CNN, go watch
[03:49:13.340 --> 03:49:18.940]  CookNN if you can't handle this, okay? Because this is for, you know, the alpha males and the
[03:49:18.940 --> 03:49:24.620]  alpha females that seriously want to have some serious discussions about who we need to identify
[03:49:24.620 --> 03:49:29.580]  and peacefully and lawfully get out of the equation, especially the pedophiles.
[03:49:31.180 --> 03:49:37.420]  What? I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about, about a conservative that sides with the
[03:49:37.420 --> 03:49:42.700]  devil and that sides with the skittle mob and that sides with the pedophiles and the groomers,
[03:49:42.700 --> 03:49:47.420]  all in the name of money, by the way. Nikki Haley, if you guys have not seen this clip,
[03:49:47.420 --> 03:49:53.180]  well, you're gonna watch it right now. She was asked on all places, on Fox News,
[03:49:54.140 --> 03:50:02.140]  all right? The Tucker killers, deep state Fox News. She was asked her opinion on the lawsuit
[03:50:02.140 --> 03:50:07.980]  on Disney versus DeSantis and listen to what she, the nerve, okay? Listen to what she said.
[03:50:07.980 --> 03:50:13.020]  I guess you and that's not productive. Ambassador Haley, I wanna ask you about
[03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:18.300]  what could be another Republican candidate in the field and that is Ron DeSantis. We just learned a
[03:50:18.300 --> 03:50:25.500]  few moments ago that Disney is now suing the Florida governor for an alleging political effort
[03:50:25.500 --> 03:50:30.780]  to hurt their business. We've all been watching this back and forth for quite some time. This is
[03:50:31.340 --> 03:50:36.380]  obviously dramatically escalating the feud between Disney and Ron DeSantis. They're
[03:50:36.380 --> 03:50:41.820]  alleging that the Republican governor has waged a, quote, relentless campaign to weaponize government
[03:50:41.820 --> 03:50:48.700]  power over the company. What is your reaction to that as we still have yet to see him jump
[03:50:48.700 --> 03:50:55.260]  officially into the race? You know, as governor, I took a double digit unemployment state and I
[03:50:55.260 --> 03:51:00.460]  turned it into an economic powerhouse. Businesses were my partners because if you take care of your
[03:51:00.460 --> 03:51:05.100]  businesses, you take care of your economy, your economy takes care of the people and everyone
[03:51:05.100 --> 03:51:11.100]  wins. And so that's the way we dealt with it. We are, South Carolina was a very anti-woke state.
[03:51:11.100 --> 03:51:16.540]  It still is. And if Disney would like to move their hundreds of thousands of jobs to South Carolina
[03:51:16.540 --> 03:51:20.540]  and bring the billions of dollars with them, I'll let them know. I'll be happy to meet them in South
[03:51:20.540 --> 03:51:25.580]  Carolina and introduce them to the governor and the legislature that would, that would welcome it.
[03:51:25.580 --> 03:51:29.260]  Hey governor, thank you so much for being with us. We really appreciate it. We've got to jump
[03:51:29.260 --> 03:51:33.740]  back to the Rose Garden. Oh, of course you appreciate it. Of course you appreciate it.
[03:51:33.740 --> 03:51:40.380]  Of course you appreciate it. Listen, that is a crony capitalist, self-identified conservative
[03:51:40.380 --> 03:51:45.740]  that's willing to put money, doesn't matter what the amount is, willing to put money,
[03:51:46.380 --> 03:51:54.780]  okay, a price tag over the safety and the innocence and the purity of your child.
[03:51:55.580 --> 03:52:00.060]  She knows what Disney's all about. She knows they have a not so gay agenda.
[03:52:00.620 --> 03:52:05.260]  She knows that the pedos and the groomers are using this as an opportunity. Come on,
[03:52:05.260 --> 03:52:09.980]  really? You think she doesn't know? Of course she knows, but you know what? We want the money.
[03:52:09.980 --> 03:52:15.820]  We want the money. Screw the degeneracy. We'll tolerate the degeneracy. We'll tolerate the
[03:52:15.820 --> 03:52:21.980]  pedophilia. We'll tolerate the grooming. We'll tolerate all the immorality and the reprobate
[03:52:21.980 --> 03:52:27.820]  behavior. Just give us the money, Disney. Just give us the money. You give us the money. You
[03:52:27.820 --> 03:52:33.260]  could be as degenerate and disgusting towards our children as you. You just have that at Disney.
[03:52:34.220 --> 03:52:38.460]  You see that, you guys? That is a wolf in sheep's clothing right there.
[03:52:38.460 --> 03:52:43.420]  That is an individual that does not care about the future of America.
[03:52:43.420 --> 03:52:49.500]  What is the future of America? The future of America are our children, are our kids,
[03:52:50.220 --> 03:52:58.700]  their purity, their holiness, their intellectual stability, their education, you name it.
[03:52:59.660 --> 03:53:05.900]  But someone like that is willing to take money. Hey, pedophiles, you're good. As long as the
[03:53:05.900 --> 03:53:12.540]  pedophiles got money, they're okay. Sound like a New World Order occultist? Yeah, it does. Do the
[03:53:12.540 --> 03:53:22.380]  math. Disgusting. What a disgusting person, right? How foul, how foul to say something like that.
[03:53:23.020 --> 03:53:29.420]  Pedophiles and pedo simps deserve to be canceled. Pedophiles and pedo simps deserve to be canceled.
[03:53:30.300 --> 03:53:37.020]  Yeah, I said it. Argue with it and see how that goes for you. Go defend the pedophiles. Go for it.
[03:53:37.020 --> 03:53:45.100]  Go for it, bro. Do it. I dare you. Cancel the pedophiles and all the pedo simps that enable
[03:53:45.100 --> 03:53:51.180]  them. It's disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. I want to say I can't believe that, but I can
[03:53:51.980 --> 03:53:57.260]  believe it. I mean, you have Elon suspending a Twitter user who created a youth-attracted
[03:53:57.260 --> 03:54:03.980]  person pedophile flag and was parading it all around Twitter. A youth-attracted person
[03:54:03.980 --> 03:54:10.060]  pedophile flag. I told you that P was coming. I told you that P was coming, you guys.
[03:54:10.700 --> 03:54:18.940]  It will be LGBTQ+, I, LMNOP, all the skittles, you name it. And that P, dude, that P
[03:54:19.500 --> 03:54:23.900]  is going to be a sexual identity because pedophiles are people too.
[03:54:25.340 --> 03:54:30.940]  Because pedophiles just have a hard time. Pedophiles are just misunderstood. No, no,
[03:54:30.940 --> 03:54:36.220]  no. They should just get a slap on the wrist and have a conversation with them.
[03:54:37.020 --> 03:54:41.260]  Why do you think that the UN, why do you think that the New World Order is trying to decriminalize
[03:54:43.500 --> 03:54:47.660]  sex with minors so they can accept this and it becomes a sexual identity?
[03:54:48.620 --> 03:54:51.660]  And so that the pedophiles can just have open sex with little kids,
[03:54:51.660 --> 03:54:56.620]  just as long as they get consent from the child. No, that's statutory rape, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:57.260 --> 03:55:01.500]  But of course, with the degeneracy, that is how the reprobate society works.
[03:55:02.540 --> 03:55:09.260]  There is no code of morality whatsoever. It's just anything goes. Anything goes.
[03:55:09.260 --> 03:55:14.140]  Speaking of anything goes, Leah Thomas is claiming that those who oppose males,
[03:55:14.860 --> 03:55:19.900]  you know, Leah Thomas, this is a dude, man. This is a dude. I'm not going to call him Leah Thomas.
[03:55:19.900 --> 03:55:25.580]  I'm going to call him a man. This man swimmer claims those who oppose males playing women's
[03:55:25.580 --> 03:55:32.940]  sports are misogynistic transphobes. Oh, they're misogynistic transphobes. Yes, ladies, do you
[03:55:32.940 --> 03:55:37.900]  hear that? All the based alpha male info warriors out there, alpha female info warriors out there.
[03:55:38.620 --> 03:55:42.700]  The mentally ill man is going to tell you what it's like to really be a woman, guys.
[03:55:42.700 --> 03:55:44.140]  Take a look at this clip.
[03:55:44.800 --> 03:55:51.800]  They're like, oh, we respect Leah as a woman, as a trans woman, whatever, we respect her identity, we just don't think it's fair.
[03:55:51.800 --> 03:55:56.800]  You can't really have that sort of half support where you're like, oh, I respect her as a woman here, but not here.
[03:55:56.800 --> 03:56:03.800]  They're using the guise of feminism to sort of push transphobic beliefs.
[03:56:03.800 --> 03:56:09.800]  And I think a lot of people in that camp sort of carry an implicit bias against trans people,
[03:56:09.800 --> 03:56:17.800]  but don't want to, I guess, fully manifest or speak that out, and so they try to just play it off as this sort of half support.
[03:56:17.800 --> 03:56:21.800]  They think about how twisted feminism, quote-unquote feminism, has become.
[03:56:21.800 --> 03:56:28.800]  Their arguments, you know, in order to exclude anybody in the trans category, you have to reduce women to reproductive capacity,
[03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:30.800]  which is, in my opinion, extremely anti-feminist.
[03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:34.800]  I don't want to put those women down either, and I know you don't want to either, because I see pain.
[03:56:34.800 --> 03:56:37.800]  I see pain, and the pain is coming from somewhere.
[03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:39.800]  It's not you, though. It's the patriarchy.
[03:56:39.800 --> 03:56:41.800]  And how can we get people to see that?
[03:56:41.800 --> 03:56:45.800]  Isn't it crazy? Isn't it crazy?
[03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:51.800]  You got two dudes sitting there just like talking down to women.
[03:56:51.800 --> 03:57:00.800]  You're a transphobe. You're a misogynistic transphobe if you don't accept the mentally ill males.
[03:57:01.800 --> 03:57:05.800]  Yeah! If you don't accept that, little girl, you're a transphobe.
[03:57:05.800 --> 03:57:09.800]  Imagine you're like 12 years old, little girl. You just want to play sports.
[03:57:09.800 --> 03:57:11.800]  Here comes this big old dude.
[03:57:11.800 --> 03:57:15.800]  You're a transphobe, little girl! You don't accept me? Get the hell out of here!
[03:57:15.800 --> 03:57:18.800]  What's wrong with you? You don't accept us? I'm a real woman.
[03:57:18.800 --> 03:57:22.800]  I'm the real woman, little girl. You get the hell out of here.
[03:57:22.800 --> 03:57:26.800]  I'm Leah Thomas. I'm more of a female than you ever will be.
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:29.800]  People are a joke!
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:31.800]  Clown world. Screw all these people, man!
[03:57:31.800 --> 03:57:34.800]  Gosh, and not that way. Not that way.
[03:57:34.800 --> 03:57:37.800]  My name is Drew Hernandez, guys. You guys can find me on Twitter.
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:39.800]  Getter Truth Social at DrewHLive.

[03:57:45.800 --> 03:57:46.800]  Owen Troyer.
[03:57:46.800 --> 03:57:51.800]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot
[03:57:51.800 --> 03:57:53.800]  because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:57:53.800 --> 03:57:55.800]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:57:55.800 --> 03:57:57.800]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:57:57.800 --> 03:57:59.800]  They wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:57:59.800 --> 03:58:02.800]  And it says, Political Prisoner.
[03:58:02.800 --> 03:58:04.800]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:58:04.800 --> 03:58:06.800]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:58:06.800 --> 03:58:08.800]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:58:08.800 --> 03:58:10.800]  Political Prisoner.
[03:58:10.800 --> 03:58:14.800]  With Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[03:58:14.800 --> 03:58:15.800]  Jail background.
[03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:20.800]  It's a fundraiser shirt. It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:58:20.800 --> 03:58:22.800]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:58:22.800 --> 03:58:23.800]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:58:23.800 --> 03:58:25.800]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:58:25.800 --> 03:58:26.800]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:58:26.800 --> 03:58:27.800]  Alex Jones for president.
