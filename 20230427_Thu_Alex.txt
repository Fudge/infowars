[00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:17.447]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:18.648]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:19.028]  Today.
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:32.974]  Fox News host Tucker Carlson ran a lengthy segment last night arguing the January 6th Capitol attack was not a violent insurrection.
[00:00:32.974 --> 00:00:37.279]  The tapes show that Capitol Police never stopped Jacob Chansley.
[00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:38.400]  They helped him.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.982]  They acted as his tour guides.
[00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:43.626]  Here's video of Chansley in the Senate chamber.
[00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:49.991]  Capitol Police officers take him to multiple entrances and even try to open locked doors for him.
[00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:56.076]  We counted at least nine officers who are within touching distance of unarmed Jacob Chansley.
[00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:59.059]  Not one of them even tried to slow him down.
[00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:07.066]  I don't think I've ever seen a primetime cable news anchor manipulate his viewers the way Mr. Carlson did last night.
[00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:08.818]  Was it a violent insurrection?
[00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.019]  It was not.
[00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:12.101]  Was it a killing of five officers in the Capitol?
[00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:13.282]  It was not.
[00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:17.827]  Those are lies, and they buried tape that contradicted and revealed those lies.
[00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:24.313]  Rupert Murdoch, who has admitted they were lies, and said he regretted it, has a special obligation.
[00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:33.244]  To stop Tucker Carlson from going on tonight, now that he's seen how he has perverted and slimed the truth.
[00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:39.446]  What they're describing, ironically, is exactly what the January 6th committee and the prosecutors in these cases did for two years.
[00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:45.547]  They selectively picked small segments of tape to convince Americans that January 6th was something that it wasn't.
[00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:52.908]  In fact, the leader of the Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, just joined the leader of the Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell, in calling for this show to be pulled off
[00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:55.470]  Fox News.
[00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.031]  Rupert Murdoch.
[00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.494]  Tell Carlson not to run a second segment.
[00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:02.316]  They're on the same side.
[00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:05.698]  The Senate Majority Leader joins the Senate Minority Leader.
[00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:06.519]  Tom Tillis.
[00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:08.841]  Mitt Romney.
[00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.363]  They're all on the same side!
[00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.044]  So it's actually not about left and right.
[00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:14.746]  It's not about Republican and Democrat.
[00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.871]  Here you have people with shared interests.
[00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.832]  The open borders people.
[00:02:19.832 --> 00:02:25.774]  The people like Mitch McConnell, who are living in splendor on Chinese money.
[00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:32.476]  The people who, underneath it all, have everything in common, are all aligned against everyone else.
[00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:36.517]  And that would include almost all news organizations in this country as well.
[00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:37.758]  The left admits it.
[00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:38.818]  Tucker says it.
[00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:40.819]  I help wake him up in radicalizing.
[00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:41.959]  He gets what's going on.
[00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.240]  He's not going back.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.180]  He believes in the people.
[00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.997]  And so I predict he won't be at Fox News in the near future if he's unable to put this out.
[00:02:50.997 --> 00:02:56.284]  Which media voices and media platforms are most influential in shaping the thinking of middle America?
[00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:05.584]  You know, once a week, I worry that something terrible will happen to Tucker Carlson because I think that if it did, we would be in a much, much worse position as a movement.
[00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:16.370]  For too long, I participated in the culture where I was like, anyone who thinks outside these pre-prescribed lanes is crazy, is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.715]  And when you look at what Tucker Carlson and some of these other folks on Fox do, it is very, very clearly incitement of violence.
[00:03:26.294 --> 00:03:29.355]  Yes, incitement to violence is a federal felony.
[00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:32.716]  And how do we regulate for people who are committing felonies?
[00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:34.616]  We arrest them and put them in jail.
[00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:36.277]  Arrest Tucker Carlson?
[00:03:36.277 --> 00:03:38.497]  Yesterday we heard from a whistleblower within the U.S.
[00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:49.280]  government who reached out to warn us that the NSA, the National Security Agency, is monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take the show off the air.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.841]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:03:54.358 --> 00:04:01.687]  Is any news organization you know of so corrupt that it's willing to hurt you on behalf of its biggest advertisers?
[00:04:01.687 --> 00:04:08.935]  The other channels took hundreds of millions of dollars from big pharma companies, and then they shilled for their sketchy products on the air.
[00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:12.800]  And as they did that, they maligned anyone who was skeptical of those products.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.341]  We'll be back!
[00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:19.104]  By the way, the entire episode of Let Them Eat Bugs, not quite as good as pizza, streaming now on Fox Nation.
[00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:23.567]  Use the promo code ORIGINALS for 30 days free, and we'll be back on Monday.
[00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:26.870]  In the meantime, have the best weekend with the ones that you love, and we'll see you then.
[00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:33.407]  Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have mutually agreed to part ways.
[00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:36.369]  Tucker's last show was this past Friday.
[00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:37.190]  What?
[00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.571]  Get out of here!
[00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:40.432]  Tucker Carlson's gonna leave Fox News?
[00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:40.632]  Yep.
[00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:45.395]  Tucker was the mainstay of the populist voiceover at Fox.
[00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:47.056]  And it's just, this is blockbuster news.
[00:04:47.056 --> 00:04:48.197]  Which means he was fired.
[00:04:48.197 --> 00:04:50.178]  I mean, that's really what parting ways means.
[00:04:52.253 --> 00:04:56.404]  The day was already good enough with the Knicks being up 3-1 and now this!
[00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:05.582]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:05:05.582 --> 00:05:07.763]  We made it even stronger.
[00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:11.506]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:17.711]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:24.476]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:25.917]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:05:26.557 --> 00:05:39.642]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:05:39.642 --> 00:05:41.623]  It is the super fuel.
[00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:43.103]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:43.943]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:44.924]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:46.104]  They go good with this.
[00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:48.145]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:05:48.846 --> 00:05:50.327]  This is the Boss.
[00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:51.068]  TurboForce.
[00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:52.088]  Back in stock.
[00:05:52.088 --> 00:05:53.109]  Discounted.
[00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:54.830]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.691]  More power.
[00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:56.712]  More strength.
[00:05:56.712 --> 00:06:09.841]  More energy.
[00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:13.384]  It's Thursday, April 27th at 23 on your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:21.492]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:21.492 --> 00:06:32.080]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.425]  Ladies and gentlemen, what a time to be alive right now.
[00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:41.528]  Welcome to this live Thursday, April 27th broadcast.
[00:06:42.614 --> 00:06:44.914]  Some huge guests in studio and more today.
[00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:47.995]  I'll tell you a little bit about coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:47.995 --> 00:07:06.918]  But first, Tucker Carlson on Twitter last night released a 2 minute 17 second clip and he knocks it completely out of the park.
[00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:11.159]  It has upwards of 60 million views so far on Twitter.
[00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:23.595]  It's been shared across the internet to an innumerable amount of people, and it shows the paper tiger that is the mouthpiece corporate media.
[00:07:23.595 --> 00:07:31.300]  Make no mistake, the firing of Tucker Carlson heralds the complete final nail in the coffin of establishment cable TV.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:48.182]  And the Deep State's attempts to silence Tucker Carlson, myself, and many others are failing because of you, the steadfast listeners and viewers that understand the key.
[00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:53.543]  Not just this nation, but almost every country in the world is under the corporate dictatorship of the globalists.
[00:07:53.543 --> 00:08:00.564]  And as the world awakens that there is a uniparty system worldwide doing this, it's game over for them.
[00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:03.765]  And Tucker Carlson understands that explicitly.
[00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:09.940]  And yes, the leftist media has pointed this out.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.760]  And yes, it's true.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:19.502]  It was this broadcast first woke Carlson up 13 years ago.
[00:08:19.502 --> 00:08:22.583]  He told me that when he traveled here to meet me.
[00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:28.984]  And then in the process, he positioned himself for what you're now witnessing happening, and they took the bait.
[00:08:32.853 --> 00:08:43.522]  And it has blown up in their face, catapulting him from the number one populist talk show host on cable to now being super iconic.
[00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:46.985]  And it has absolutely turned the tables on them.
[00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:52.610]  And they'll have no way other than killing him to stop him.
[00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:59.675]  And you can bet your bottom dollar that within six months or so, probably sooner, he's taking some time off.
[00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:07.147]  You're going to see Tucker Carlson come back stronger than ever.
[00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:28.565]  And that's what all the leftists on The View and the young turds on YouTube and all the CNN minions and all the gremlins over at MSNBC and all the trolls over at CBS and all the jokes over at the Huffington Post don't understand that while they're celebrating his crucifixion
[00:09:31.192 --> 00:09:35.274]  They have absolutely fallen into our trap.
[00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:45.900]  And if you think their persecution of Alex Jones hurt them, which it did previously, it is absolutely blowing up in their face.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.241]  Yeah, they're indicting Trump.
[00:09:47.241 --> 00:09:48.462]  Yeah, they're firing Carlson.
[00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:49.782]  Yeah, they're trying to destroy Jones.
[00:09:49.782 --> 00:09:51.043]  Yeah, they're going after all of us.
[00:09:51.043 --> 00:09:53.264]  But we know who they are.
[00:09:53.264 --> 00:09:54.265]  We know they're a fraud.
[00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:56.626]  And we know they're giving us no quarter.
[00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:59.848]  And every metric shows the worm has turned.
[00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:04.520]  The point of no return for their collapse is now here.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.941]  Now again, this is a short clip.
[00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:10.063]  First thing he's put out since Friday being fired.
[00:10:10.063 --> 00:10:20.507]  And, conservatively, hundreds of millions of people have watched this, and it only went up last night at 8 o'clock Eastern when he normally would start a show.
[00:10:20.507 --> 00:10:30.311]  And so, what you'll be seeing is, on a routine basis, monologues from Tucker Carlson.
[00:10:31.274 --> 00:10:32.054]  And isn't it funny?
[00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:33.575]  This one's obviously shot on an iPhone.
[00:10:33.575 --> 00:10:37.397]  You can see it's not even a television camera.
[00:10:37.397 --> 00:10:40.239]  Doesn't have the big, giant, fancy studio, though he's got that.
[00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:42.840]  Multiple ones he owns.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:50.524]  Funny how he's just been getting positioned for this.
[00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:51.705]  Anyways.
[00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:54.867]  And oh, such a shock he was going to get fired.
[00:10:54.867 --> 00:10:58.208]  That's why I told you on March 8th he'd probably be gone in the next few months.
[00:11:00.154 --> 00:11:04.636]  So I just want our enemies to know that you play one-dimensional checkers.
[00:11:04.636 --> 00:11:09.318]  You don't play chess, you don't play two-dimensional, three-dimensional, four-dimensional.
[00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:14.720]  A non-two-dimensional thinker would see this immediately.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.501]  Any student of Hegelian dialectic would understand it.
[00:11:17.501 --> 00:11:23.824]  But the left is so degenerate, so wacko, they've only inherited the world their grandparents stole.
[00:11:25.148 --> 00:11:27.009]  With fractional reserve banking in their system.
[00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:46.279]  They've inherited unlimited money and all this power and all this control, and their main focus is stamping out manhood, stamping out the family, destroying the middle class, and dominating America, the source of their power, while they destroy the American spirit that they harnessed that was the source of their power.
[00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:50.261]  So it's quite the moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:50.261 --> 00:11:53.423]  And Tucker, in this clip, it's posted up at InfoWars.com, I hope you share it.
[00:11:55.307 --> 00:12:02.129]  In just two minutes and 17 seconds lays beautifully out what we're facing.
[00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:11.573]  A uniparty that's hijacked the country, that's surveilling and censoring and persecuting and attacking the people to drive us into submission.
[00:12:11.573 --> 00:12:18.135]  They did years of lockdowns and attempted forced injections and everything they're doing is a plan to destroy us.
[00:12:18.135 --> 00:12:23.717]  And now all the major populist and conservative political cartoons are saying that.
[00:12:24.537 --> 00:12:30.843]  And all the freethinkers are seeing and saying Alex Jones was right.
[00:12:30.843 --> 00:12:32.424]  They're out to get us.
[00:12:32.424 --> 00:12:35.487]  They're the New World Order.
[00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:43.414]  So, it's been said different ways in many ways, but it comes down to this.
[00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:47.137]  You think we're in here with you?
[00:12:47.137 --> 00:12:48.098]  You're in here with us!
[00:12:50.226 --> 00:12:53.428]  And we've done a great job not taking your race war bait.
[00:12:53.428 --> 00:13:09.916]  We've done a great job not being violent and being Christ-like at this point to let everybody see who you are, to draw you out and let you run around and freak out and scream and yell and panic and piss on us and dominate us and bully us while everybody's watching.
[00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:10.817]  So yeah, you'll be able to...
[00:13:11.876 --> 00:13:23.064]  Good evening, it's Tucker Carlson.
[00:13:23.064 --> 00:13:30.328]  One of the first things you realize when you step outside the noise for a few days is how many genuinely nice people there are in this country.
[00:13:30.328 --> 00:13:31.489]  Kind and decent people.
[00:13:31.489 --> 00:13:34.111]  People who really care about what's true.
[00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:36.913]  And a bunch of hilarious people, also.
[00:13:36.913 --> 00:13:38.074]  A lot of those.
[00:13:38.074 --> 00:13:40.115]  It's gotta be the majority of the population, even now.
[00:13:42.295 --> 00:13:50.017]  The other thing you notice when you take a little time off is how unbelievably stupid most of the debates you see on television are.
[00:13:50.017 --> 00:13:51.577]  They're completely irrelevant.
[00:13:51.577 --> 00:13:52.998]  They mean nothing.
[00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.839]  In five years we won't even remember that we had them.
[00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:58.439]  Trust me as someone who's participated.
[00:13:58.439 --> 00:14:07.982]  And yet at the same time, and this is the amazing thing, the undeniably big topics, the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all.
[00:14:07.982 --> 00:14:08.202]  War.
[00:14:08.783 --> 00:14:15.887]  Civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, natural resources.
[00:14:15.887 --> 00:14:20.290]  When was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues?
[00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.951]  It's been a long time.
[00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:25.313]  Debates like that are not permitted in American media.
[00:14:25.313 --> 00:14:34.539]  Both political parties and their donors have reached consensus on what benefits them, and they actively collude to shut down any conversation about it.
[00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:39.678]  Suddenly, the United States looks very much like a one-party state.
[00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:43.300]  That's a depressing realization, but it's not permanent.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.242]  Our current orthodoxies won't last.
[00:14:46.242 --> 00:14:47.622]  They're brain dead.
[00:14:47.622 --> 00:14:49.764]  Nobody actually believes them.
[00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.905]  Hardly anyone's life is improved by them.
[00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:57.908]  This moment is too inherently ridiculous to continue, and so it won't.
[00:14:57.908 --> 00:14:59.148]  The people in charge know this.
[00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.390]  That's why they're hysterical and aggressive.
[00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.010]  They're afraid.
[00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.333]  They've given up persuasion, they're resorting to force.
[00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:07.774]  But it won't work.
[00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:14.399]  When honest people say what's true, calmly and without embarrassment, they become powerful.
[00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:20.204]  At the same time, the liars who've been trying to silence them shrink, and they become weaker.
[00:15:20.204 --> 00:15:21.986]  That's the iron law of the universe.
[00:15:21.986 --> 00:15:24.428]  True things prevail.
[00:15:24.428 --> 00:15:27.650]  Where can you still find Americans saying true things?
[00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.773]  There aren't many places left, but there are some, and that's enough.
[00:15:31.638 --> 00:15:34.880]  As long as you can hear the words, there is hope.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.280]  See you soon.
[00:16:00.276 --> 00:16:06.260]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.922]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:16:08.922 --> 00:16:11.103]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:13.705]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:16.927]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:16:16.927 --> 00:16:18.688]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:16:18.688 --> 00:16:25.313]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:16:25.313 --> 00:16:28.095]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:31.180]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.804]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:16:35.804 --> 00:16:39.546]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:42.668]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:45.210]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.571]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:16:46.571 --> 00:16:52.355]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:52.355 --> 00:16:53.735]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:55.056]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:59.019]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:16:59.167 --> 00:16:59.251]  Shhh!
[00:17:08.294 --> 00:17:16.998]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:17:16.998 --> 00:17:19.178]  So support InfoWars Store.
[00:17:19.178 --> 00:17:27.662]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:17:27.662 --> 00:17:30.363]  And again, magnesium is critical for your
[00:17:30.803 --> 00:17:32.324]  Muscles and everything.
[00:17:32.324 --> 00:17:33.225]  Krill oil.
[00:17:33.225 --> 00:17:41.009]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[00:17:41.009 --> 00:17:47.013]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[00:17:47.013 --> 00:17:49.755]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:51.956]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[00:17:51.956 --> 00:17:53.857]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:17:53.857 --> 00:17:57.199]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:59.221]  You have to have these products.
[00:17:59.801 --> 00:18:03.350]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[00:18:08.069 --> 00:18:09.410]  I want you all to know something.
[00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.372]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:11.372 --> 00:18:14.914]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[00:18:14.914 --> 00:18:18.017]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:18:18.017 --> 00:18:22.300]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.502]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:24.502 --> 00:18:28.024]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:31.487]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:18:31.727 --> 00:18:34.609]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:35.649]  Years ago.
[00:18:35.649 --> 00:18:39.712]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[00:18:39.712 --> 00:18:42.233]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:18:42.233 --> 00:18:44.694]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:18:44.694 --> 00:18:47.816]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:18:47.816 --> 00:18:52.479]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:18:59.997 --> 00:19:05.601]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially and with word of mouth and prayer.
[00:19:05.601 --> 00:19:13.205]  All the success that we've had together against the Globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:19:13.205 --> 00:19:15.427]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[00:19:16.187 --> 00:19:23.230]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com, like books, and films, and supplements, and water filtration, air filtration, and so much more.
[00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:36.436]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to InfoWarsTore.com and right at the top you'll see a link to make a straight donation.
[00:19:36.436 --> 00:19:39.197]  A one-time donation of $5, $10, $50, or a recurring donation you can cancel any time.
[00:19:42.478 --> 00:19:43.919]  I want to thank all you that have donated.
[00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:57.471]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance, that's countering the Great Reset by going to InfoWarsTore.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[00:19:57.471 --> 00:19:58.792]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:19:58.792 --> 00:20:00.774]  Please take action.
[00:20:00.774 --> 00:20:06.659]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:12.599 --> 00:20:21.985]  Mahatma Gandhi, before he peacefully overthrew the British Empire in India, said something very important.
[00:20:21.985 --> 00:20:23.706]  First, your enemies ignore you.
[00:20:23.706 --> 00:20:24.927]  Then they laugh at you.
[00:20:24.927 --> 00:20:26.968]  Then they attack you.
[00:20:26.968 --> 00:20:28.889]  Then you win.
[00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:32.151]  We have entered the final phase.
[00:20:32.151 --> 00:20:36.094]  And as long as those of us at the tip of the spear are willing to take the punishment,
[00:20:37.242 --> 00:20:44.504]  Our women and our children and our society will go through the gap behind us and we will secure the future.
[00:20:44.504 --> 00:20:51.967]  That's what this is all about, boys and girls.
[00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:56.468]  I don't just give you good news to give you good news to make you feel good.
[00:20:56.468 --> 00:20:59.469]  We have positioned the enemy for their destruction.
[00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:10.278]  The volcanic eruption of freedom and the desire for free will has successfully been triggered.
[00:21:10.278 --> 00:21:18.147]  The dominoes are falling, but some of us must first go to the fire and come out stronger on the other side.
[00:21:18.147 --> 00:21:23.433]  You can't win, Doc.
[00:21:25.094 --> 00:21:36.656]  You strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[00:21:36.656 --> 00:21:38.097]  You should not have come back.
[00:21:55.254 --> 00:21:58.056]  And here's the move!
[00:21:58.056 --> 00:21:58.277]  Ben?
[00:22:30.823 --> 00:22:34.587]  They took the bait.
[00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:36.889]  We withstood the pain.
[00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:44.077]  Now, the beginning of the end of the New World Order has begun.
[00:22:50.492 --> 00:22:54.355]  We're far from ending this war, but we've turned the tide.
[00:22:54.355 --> 00:23:05.163]  But you should take a few minutes to savor the fact the number one story in the world is Tucker Carlson being fired, and it's only getting bigger as everyone rediscovers everything he said.
[00:23:05.163 --> 00:23:09.666]  I've already been through this process myself.
[00:23:09.666 --> 00:23:16.551]  A humble little detonator that was attached to the larger explosive stockpile.
[00:23:16.551 --> 00:23:16.932]  And now,
[00:23:18.237 --> 00:23:24.320]  Politically, non-violently, a major explosion and chain reaction has begun.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:34.126]  And all the King's Horses and all the New World Order's men can't put their satanic pedophile network back together again.
[00:23:34.126 --> 00:23:41.330]  So let the pain and the persecution and the bullying we're going to go through come as sweet victory.
[00:23:42.418 --> 00:23:53.645]  Because just like when the police began to split the heads of black Americans demanding the right to civil rights and release the police dogs and the fire hoses on them, they had won.
[00:23:53.645 --> 00:24:03.991]  And all of us now have to go through that in a high-tech fashion and hold the line that the enemy will commit terror attacks.
[00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:05.552]  They will blame it on us, but no one's going to buy it.
[00:24:05.552 --> 00:24:08.594]  And we're going to have to go through this process.
[00:24:08.594 --> 00:24:10.235]  And some of us will have to be killed.
[00:24:11.294 --> 00:24:12.535]  Some of us will have to be in prison.
[00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:14.375]  Some of us will have to be tortured.
[00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:17.657]  But that's what men are supposed to go through.
[00:24:17.657 --> 00:24:18.557]  That's what it's all about.
[00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:22.479]  You weren't put here to just sit around and watch Netflix and eat chili dogs.
[00:24:22.479 --> 00:24:23.920]  Oh, that sounds good.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.860]  And drink beer.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.281]  We were here for this test right now.
[00:24:27.281 --> 00:24:35.345]  And I am just superlatively blessed to be associated with this crew and this audience of activists and patriots.
[00:24:35.345 --> 00:24:37.106]  And I am so blessed to be associated
[00:24:38.817 --> 00:24:42.261]  With the radicalization of Tucker Carlson.
[00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:44.724]  This is such an important thing.
[00:24:44.724 --> 00:24:54.976]  Much more important than if you were a National Baseball League scout and you went out and found the next Babe Ruth.
[00:24:58.168 --> 00:25:00.429]  Because this is for all the marbles.
[00:25:00.429 --> 00:25:02.450]  This is about life and death and transcendence.
[00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.990]  This is about everything.
[00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:15.074]  And the criminal, out-of-control globalists that have sold America out and they now want to dumb us down further to secure their victory of tyranny.
[00:25:15.074 --> 00:25:25.278]  The fact that they're being spotlighted like cockroaches when you flip the light on at midnight is beautiful.
[00:25:26.499 --> 00:25:27.019]  And it's here.
[00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:28.119]  So here's a meme.
[00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:30.740]  For radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.981]  Shows a Fox News individual behind a desk at a convention center.
[00:25:34.981 --> 00:25:38.402]  No one's lined up at the Fox News desk.
[00:25:38.402 --> 00:25:46.683]  Everyone is lined up at the Tucker Carlson desk, which is the anti-New World Order, anti-globalist, pro-human, populist desk.
[00:25:46.683 --> 00:25:48.924]  And now Elon Musk is lined up at that desk.
[00:25:50.506 --> 00:25:52.868]  Because we're all Alex Jones now.
[00:25:52.868 --> 00:25:55.871]  It's not that Alex Jones was right and right again and is right.
[00:25:55.871 --> 00:25:58.053]  It's that we were all right.
[00:25:58.053 --> 00:26:09.584]  I was just a prominent person that believed in humanity and bet on you and believed that if we persevered and went through hell and didn't take the payoffs and didn't back down to the threats that we could beat these people.
[00:26:09.584 --> 00:26:13.727]  And we are beating them right now.
[00:26:13.727 --> 00:26:15.269]  And if we just have the eye of the tiger
[00:26:16.607 --> 00:26:22.369]  And stay focused, and pray to God, and humble ourselves, and speak out and have courage.
[00:26:22.369 --> 00:26:24.489]  In a focused, calm way, as Tucker Carlson said.
[00:26:24.489 --> 00:26:26.450]  I'm not always that way.
[00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.410]  But the way he does it's the best.
[00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.431]  He's a great role model for us all.
[00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:33.812]  We will win.
[00:26:33.812 --> 00:26:35.432]  Our culture will win.
[00:26:35.432 --> 00:26:37.012]  Our children will win.
[00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:37.953]  Our progeny will win.
[00:26:37.953 --> 00:26:41.194]  Our future will succeed.
[00:26:41.194 --> 00:26:42.334]  The enemy wants the future.
[00:26:43.732 --> 00:26:49.854]  And to do it, they poisoned us with every vile cultural degeneracy you can imagine.
[00:26:49.854 --> 00:26:53.635]  But in the final equation, people have a hunger for freedom.
[00:26:53.635 --> 00:26:57.516]  And when good men and women stand up, there's no tyrant on earth that can stand against us.
[00:26:57.516 --> 00:26:58.296]  All right.
[00:26:58.296 --> 00:26:59.696]  Again, this is bigger than Tucker Carlson.
[00:26:59.696 --> 00:27:01.137]  It's bigger than any one of us.
[00:27:01.137 --> 00:27:03.717]  It's a Rosetta Stone.
[00:27:03.717 --> 00:27:07.278]  It is a skeleton key, as I say, that opens every door.
[00:27:07.278 --> 00:27:09.599]  Through this story, you can see every angle of it.
[00:27:09.599 --> 00:27:11.499]  I mean, each piece of this is so incredible.
[00:27:11.499 --> 00:27:12.900]  I'll hit next segment.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.460]  Look at this one.
[00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:18.912]  And I already knew the inside baseball on this, I'll leave it at that.
[00:27:18.912 --> 00:27:19.352]  Wait.
[00:27:19.352 --> 00:27:20.853]  But I waited until this came out.
[00:27:20.853 --> 00:27:31.757]  The ex-Tucker Carlson producer who's suing him at Fox has never met him.
[00:27:31.757 --> 00:27:33.677]  I'll tell you all about that.
[00:27:33.677 --> 00:27:34.177]  This.
[00:27:34.177 --> 00:27:38.219]  Fox News primetime ratings plummet after Tucker Carlson's firing.
[00:27:38.219 --> 00:27:40.300]  And Newsmax sees boost.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.000]  And Tucker Carlson
[00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:51.292]  Has over 60 million views on the Twitter video alone.
[00:27:51.292 --> 00:27:56.636]  How'd that work out for you?
[00:27:56.636 --> 00:28:07.024]  Tucker Carlson's had more viewers in a two minute, 17 second video than Fox News has had all week.
[00:28:07.024 --> 00:28:09.225]  And it will continue.
[00:28:09.225 --> 00:28:12.228]  Oh, and if you kill him, I'm sad for him and his family.
[00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:21.274]  But Tucker's committed to whatever happens and says, I don't care, I'm not stopping, ever!
[00:28:21.274 --> 00:28:24.675]  Ever!
[00:28:24.675 --> 00:28:28.336]  He's looked right into my eyes.
[00:28:28.336 --> 00:28:32.377]  Late last year.
[00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:37.399]  And said, I've never been so alive, I love this so much, humanity's gonna win, we're never gonna stop.
[00:28:38.797 --> 00:28:43.058]  I'm not going to tell you the rest of that long, in-depth meeting.
[00:28:43.058 --> 00:28:53.201]  But the point is, if you think Tucker Carlson didn't see this coming, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:56.982]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we have the path to victory.
[00:28:56.982 --> 00:28:57.302]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.946 --> 00:29:04.972]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:29:04.972 --> 00:29:07.135]  We made it even stronger.
[00:29:07.135 --> 00:29:10.879]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:29:10.879 --> 00:29:15.125]  Turbo Force is back in stock at MFORSTORE.COM or 888-253-3139.
[00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:15.825]  It's not just
[00:29:19.109 --> 00:29:24.170]  Wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:25.930]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:39.013]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:29:39.013 --> 00:29:40.993]  It is the super fuel.
[00:29:40.993 --> 00:29:42.473]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:29:42.473 --> 00:29:43.333]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:44.293]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:29:44.293 --> 00:29:45.474]  They go good with this.
[00:29:45.474 --> 00:29:47.494]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:29:48.234 --> 00:29:49.714]  This is the boss.
[00:29:49.714 --> 00:29:50.455]  TurboForce.
[00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.455]  Back in stock.
[00:29:51.455 --> 00:29:52.475]  Discounted.
[00:29:52.475 --> 00:29:54.196]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:54.196 --> 00:29:55.076]  More power.
[00:29:55.076 --> 00:29:56.076]  More strength.
[00:29:56.076 --> 00:29:59.897]  More energy.
[00:29:59.897 --> 00:30:06.579]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:08.499]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:30:08.499 --> 00:30:10.020]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.820]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.821]  And it says, political prisoner.
[00:30:15.621 --> 00:30:17.582]  With an image of President Trump.
[00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:20.022]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:30:20.022 --> 00:30:22.163]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:30:22.163 --> 00:30:27.525]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:28.745]  Jail background.
[00:30:28.745 --> 00:30:29.785]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:30:29.785 --> 00:30:33.927]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:30:33.927 --> 00:30:35.527]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[00:30:35.527 --> 00:30:36.547]  No, I'm not running for President.
[00:30:36.547 --> 00:30:39.088]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:30:39.088 --> 00:30:39.868]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:30:39.868 --> 00:30:41.449]  Alex Jones for President.
[00:30:41.449 --> 00:30:41.689]  24.
[00:30:41.689 --> 00:30:44.310]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.050]  Great way to fund.
[00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.873]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:30:48.873 --> 00:30:51.715]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:30:51.715 --> 00:30:55.058]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:30:55.058 --> 00:31:02.403]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:31:15.546 --> 00:31:19.113]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:31:19.113 --> 00:31:26.008]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:31:26.008 --> 00:31:26.909]  It's really just incredible.
[00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:31.572]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:31:31.572 --> 00:31:37.355]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:31:37.355 --> 00:31:40.376]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:31:40.376 --> 00:31:48.621]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:53.604]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[00:31:53.604 --> 00:31:58.568]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:31:58.568 --> 00:31:59.469]  Please take action now.
[00:31:59.469 --> 00:32:02.931]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:32:07.768 --> 00:32:09.109]  I want you all to know something.
[00:32:09.109 --> 00:32:11.070]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.592]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:32:14.592 --> 00:32:17.713]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:32:17.713 --> 00:32:21.955]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:32:21.955 --> 00:32:24.176]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:27.698]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:32:27.698 --> 00:32:31.160]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.301]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:35.322]  Years ago.
[00:32:35.322 --> 00:32:39.403]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[00:32:39.403 --> 00:32:41.925]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:32:41.925 --> 00:32:44.386]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:32:44.386 --> 00:32:47.507]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:52.149]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:33:01.696 --> 00:33:06.282]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.282 --> 00:33:18.837]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.837 --> 00:33:19.478]  Rising up!
[00:33:35.631 --> 00:33:47.477]  The allegory, the analogy of Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi is very instructive, but here's one that's even more instructive.
[00:33:47.477 --> 00:33:51.899]  V for Vendetta.
[00:33:51.899 --> 00:33:54.601]  So do you know what's going to happen?
[00:33:54.601 --> 00:33:54.721]  No.
[00:33:55.996 --> 00:33:59.619]  It was a feeling.
[00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:03.203]  But I can guess.
[00:34:03.203 --> 00:34:06.426]  With so much chaos, someone will do something stupid.
[00:34:06.426 --> 00:34:13.973]  And when they do, things will turn nasty.
[00:34:29.264 --> 00:34:31.126]  The rioters were arrested in Brixton.
[00:34:31.126 --> 00:34:39.036]  And then, Sutler will be forced to do the only thing he knows how to do.
[00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:45.563]  At which point, all V needs to do is keep his word.
[00:34:45.563 --> 00:34:45.944]  And then...
[00:35:54.143 --> 00:36:02.685]  You're living in the most epic time our species has ever been in.
[00:36:02.685 --> 00:36:03.566]  All dead on this planet.
[00:36:03.566 --> 00:36:08.207]  And I'm so honored to be here with you.
[00:36:08.207 --> 00:36:08.607]  Today.
[00:36:08.607 --> 00:36:10.707]  In defiance of their tyranny.
[00:36:10.707 --> 00:36:13.628]  Alright.
[00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:24.746]  Let's look through the lens of the Tucker Carlson situation and the controlled corporate prostitute system celebrating his supposed fall.
[00:36:24.746 --> 00:36:33.632]  But if you don't buy the propaganda and realize that Carlson is just an archetype of us all, great victory is now at hand.
[00:36:33.632 --> 00:36:34.013]  U.S.
[00:36:34.013 --> 00:36:42.759]  Army PSYOPs expert Fox News fired Carlson to maintain semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[00:36:42.759 --> 00:36:44.200]  And that is exactly what they want.
[00:36:48.007 --> 00:36:57.709]  A voice of unity, a voice of peace, a voice of justice, a voice of populism and prosperity and security, calling that a racist terrorist, a violent seeker.
[00:36:57.709 --> 00:36:59.750]  We'll get to that more in a moment.
[00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.790]  Fox News primetime ratings plummet after Tucker Carlson firing.
[00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.951]  Yahoo News.
[00:37:05.951 --> 00:37:14.473]  And this very interesting little tidbit, and I've already experienced this and I'm not going to spend an hour telling you any of the stories, but
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.264]  Wait, the ex-Tucker Carlson producer who's suing him and Fox never met him.
[00:37:22.264 --> 00:37:35.434]  You see, Tucker, what was it, four or five years ago, left DC and moved to Boca Grande on the west coast of Florida, about an hour and a half south of Tampa.
[00:37:35.434 --> 00:37:36.995]  And one of the reasons he did that was
[00:37:39.138 --> 00:37:47.701]  They were trying to set him up, like they've done so many people, with the staff members, with the interns, with the executives, with the people.
[00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:53.723]  And it's not just Tucker, but many of these high-profile people have to have an assistant with them at all times.
[00:37:53.723 --> 00:37:59.885]  You can never be in a room alone in these larger facilities because they send these people in.
[00:37:59.885 --> 00:38:01.886]  Oh, I'm not saying they sent her in.
[00:38:01.886 --> 00:38:07.628]  She reportedly has 90-plus recordings and has people making jokes and things about the left.
[00:38:08.479 --> 00:38:15.507]  And it's suing and saying it was all anti-Semitic!
[00:38:15.507 --> 00:38:20.953]  While the ADL calls for Tucker to be removed.
[00:38:20.953 --> 00:38:28.862]  They've had national newspapers, we're not going to put them on screen, I don't give it any attention, on record pay people that have worked here.
[00:38:32.708 --> 00:38:36.049]  To say things that are 100% manufactured, not true.
[00:38:36.049 --> 00:38:43.431]  And then I talked to crew members after these people had left and then gone and done this, at least three of them, and they said it was so strange.
[00:38:43.431 --> 00:38:48.513]  They'd walk in the break room and start saying the N-word and trying to get us to say it.
[00:38:48.513 --> 00:38:49.433]  We'd say, stop that.
[00:38:49.433 --> 00:38:51.274]  We even told the person not to say it.
[00:38:51.274 --> 00:38:54.155]  They were black.
[00:38:54.155 --> 00:39:00.777]  And then one of the other people involved in this on road trips, the crew members came back and when I found out about it, the person quote, quit.
[00:39:01.735 --> 00:39:07.178]  Would say, you know, I'm so sick of these black people, and would start talking about the N-words.
[00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:11.021]  And multiple crew members would say, I like everybody.
[00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:12.461]  I'm a Christian.
[00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:13.142]  I don't agree with that.
[00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:15.023]  You need to stop that.
[00:39:15.023 --> 00:39:17.324]  And obviously, we know what was going on.
[00:39:17.324 --> 00:39:21.707]  We were being recorded, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:21.707 --> 00:39:24.508]  And I even learned the details of the law firms, the people that were involved.
[00:39:24.508 --> 00:39:26.830]  This is intelligence agency level stuff.
[00:39:32.554 --> 00:39:46.719]  Now, Tucker Carlson's alone in rooms with me, and we've had our meetings, because he knows I'm not gonna lie about him or make stuff up, but he can't be in the room with almost anybody alone, because he knows this.
[00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:53.981]  He gets out of his car, he goes into the studio with a trusted crew, and he's still never in a room alone with any of them.
[00:39:53.981 --> 00:39:55.582]  Think about living like that.
[00:39:55.582 --> 00:39:59.303]  That's what you've gotta do to have victory in this.
[00:39:59.303 --> 00:40:01.864]  And I tell you those stories to understand how high the stakes are
[00:40:03.598 --> 00:40:12.219]  And how incredibly serious these people are.
[00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:18.781]  But by the grace of God, Tucker has kept his nose clean and so have I. And they've never been able to set us up.
[00:40:18.781 --> 00:40:21.541]  But they have tried long and they have tried hard.
[00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:29.823]  But you're gonna hear about this Abby Grossberg all day long.
[00:40:29.823 --> 00:40:32.203]  That didn't even work in the same state with Carlson.
[00:40:34.835 --> 00:40:39.897]  And never met him.
[00:40:39.897 --> 00:40:50.482]  Never met him.
[00:40:50.482 --> 00:40:55.305]  On a mission.
[00:40:55.305 --> 00:41:00.427]  In my view of deception.
[00:41:00.427 --> 00:41:01.748]  So, Fox News
[00:41:04.648 --> 00:41:07.930]  Has about 15 million independent different viewers a day.
[00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.892]  Tucker was actually way higher than that.
[00:41:09.892 --> 00:41:11.973]  They just gave lowball numbers.
[00:41:11.973 --> 00:41:16.576]  It was so embarrassing the rest of cable news.
[00:41:16.576 --> 00:41:22.380]  And now his first video, conservatively, has hundreds of millions of views.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.182]  67 million on Twitter alone.
[00:41:26.182 --> 00:41:30.325]  What does that say about them and their whole system and everything they've set up and what they've done?
[00:41:30.325 --> 00:41:31.446]  And I know like Alex Jones,
[00:41:32.722 --> 00:41:41.470]  Tucker Carlson's really never made any mistakes, but he's been able to learn from mine, and has.
[00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.752]  And so, again, what does that say about this power structure?
[00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:54.501]  They have a company making tens of billions of dollars a year, and paying a talk show host $20 million a year and didn't even care about the money, took a major pay cut to, quote, have control of the show.
[00:41:55.763 --> 00:42:04.691]  And their billions and billions of dollars and all of it can't get one-tenth the viewers he has now that he's left them.
[00:42:04.691 --> 00:42:12.878]  But if it wasn't the fact that Elon Musk had taken over Twitter, you better believe they would have removed him Friday from Twitter when he was fired to fully silence him.
[00:42:12.878 --> 00:42:19.444]  But because he has that one platform, it makes all the others look ridiculous and they take him down, so they can't do it.
[00:42:20.888 --> 00:42:26.390]  And we have a wedge into the enemy operation, and from that beachhead, they'll be destroyed.
[00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:34.633]  And not just with Tucker Carlson, but the idea and the understanding of this, of how weak and what a paper tiger the enemy is.
[00:42:34.633 --> 00:42:41.076]  I want to get more into this PsyOps expert.
[00:42:41.076 --> 00:42:42.236]  When we come back, ex-U.S.
[00:42:42.236 --> 00:42:48.519]  Army PsyOps expert, Fox News fired Carlson to maintain, quote, semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded populations.
[00:42:49.286 --> 00:42:51.933]  I wouldn't call them semi-lobotomized retarded.
[00:42:51.933 --> 00:42:52.755]  I would say what they are.
[00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:53.938]  In a trance.
[00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:55.101]  In a daydream.
[00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:56.143]  Under a spell.
[00:42:56.143 --> 00:42:57.707]  And we're breaking that spell now.
[00:43:00.416 --> 00:43:06.397]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:43:06.397 --> 00:43:09.038]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:43:09.038 --> 00:43:11.239]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:43:11.239 --> 00:43:13.819]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:43:13.819 --> 00:43:17.040]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.801]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:25.422]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:43:25.422 --> 00:43:28.223]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:43:29.198 --> 00:43:31.299]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:43:31.299 --> 00:43:35.943]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:43:35.943 --> 00:43:39.665]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:43:39.665 --> 00:43:42.787]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[00:43:42.787 --> 00:43:45.349]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:46.710]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:49.412]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[00:43:49.412 --> 00:43:52.494]  We're all getting great products at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:52.494 --> 00:43:53.854]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:43:53.854 --> 00:43:55.175]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:43:55.175 --> 00:43:59.098]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:44:00.379 --> 00:44:04.522]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:44:04.522 --> 00:44:08.264]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:44:08.264 --> 00:44:10.665]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:44:10.665 --> 00:44:13.047]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:44:13.047 --> 00:44:15.569]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:44:16.369 --> 00:44:20.836]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:44:20.836 --> 00:44:24.241]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:44:24.241 --> 00:44:28.287]  They took the babies out of 80 layers and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:44:28.287 --> 00:44:30.891]  It was almost as if it were a plan in quotes.
[00:44:30.891 --> 00:44:32.053]  It just can't happen.
[00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:34.274]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[00:44:34.274 --> 00:44:34.674]  Set!
[00:44:34.674 --> 00:44:35.454]  Set!
[00:44:35.454 --> 00:44:36.155]  Set!
[00:44:36.155 --> 00:44:38.296]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:44:38.296 --> 00:44:39.916]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:44:39.916 --> 00:44:43.118]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:44:43.118 --> 00:44:44.598]  You silenced those voices.
[00:44:44.598 --> 00:44:48.360]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:54.783]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:45:05.433 --> 00:45:06.839]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:45:06.839 --> 00:45:08.766]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:45:08.766 --> 00:45:09.348]  It is!
[00:45:09.348 --> 00:45:10.893]  But if you took it with bish oil...
[00:45:12.183 --> 00:45:14.224]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[00:45:14.224 --> 00:45:15.564]  The fish oil's better than it.
[00:45:15.564 --> 00:45:17.384]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:45:17.384 --> 00:45:19.865]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:45:19.865 --> 00:45:21.505]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:45:21.505 --> 00:45:22.985]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:45:22.985 --> 00:45:24.466]  Krill oils is the best.
[00:45:24.466 --> 00:45:25.806]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:26.666]  And I'm just sorry.
[00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:27.667]  You want something like this?
[00:45:27.667 --> 00:45:28.627]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:45:28.627 --> 00:45:30.547]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:45:30.547 --> 00:45:31.167]  It's so good.
[00:45:31.167 --> 00:45:31.767]  In my view.
[00:45:31.767 --> 00:45:34.108]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:45:34.108 --> 00:45:36.809]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:45:36.809 --> 00:45:38.409]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:45:40.194 --> 00:45:47.701]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:53.746]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:45:53.746 --> 00:45:54.487]  I just can't do it!
[00:46:01.198 --> 00:46:04.301]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:46:04.301 --> 00:46:06.602]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:46:06.602 --> 00:46:10.545]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:46:10.545 --> 00:46:14.469]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[00:46:15.922 --> 00:46:19.464]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:46:19.464 --> 00:46:28.289]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:46:28.289 --> 00:46:31.931]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:46:31.931 --> 00:46:36.874]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:46:37.714 --> 00:46:49.037]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:46:49.037 --> 00:46:53.978]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:58.940]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.860]  Please take action now.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:06.742]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:19.405 --> 00:47:21.607]  Lord, I can't change.
[00:47:21.607 --> 00:47:23.789]  I'm not gonna roll over.
[00:47:23.789 --> 00:47:26.250]  I'm gonna fly.
[00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.611]  Tree Bird, baby!
[00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:30.634]  Woo!
[00:47:30.634 --> 00:47:37.259]  America is discovering the coup.
[00:47:37.259 --> 00:47:39.320]  America is discovering the enemy.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.721]  The chain reaction has begun.
[00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:44.564]  It is beautiful.
[00:47:44.564 --> 00:47:48.147]  Today, in studio, next hour, Brian Rose of London Real, great thinker.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.361]  Can't wait to have him here.
[00:47:50.361 --> 00:47:53.903]  He's an American, but he's really kicked ass over in Europe.
[00:47:53.903 --> 00:48:07.992]  Luke Rutkowski, one of my old friends going back 18 years, to be joining us to cover the waterfront as well, and then the amazing Drew Hernandez, our number four today.
[00:48:07.992 --> 00:48:10.714]  So, let's talk about the reality.
[00:48:10.714 --> 00:48:12.035]  They got rid of Tucker Carlson.
[00:48:12.035 --> 00:48:15.637]  The most astute thing I've heard about this was because of what he might say in the future.
[00:48:15.637 --> 00:48:18.019]  They were already upset about everything else he said in the past.
[00:48:19.008 --> 00:48:25.392]  And the fact that he was convincing the intelligentsia and the establishment to go against the New World Order.
[00:48:25.392 --> 00:48:35.078]  And the fact that he was working with major whistleblowers at the highest levels of the Border Patrol up confirming massive child kidnapping rings worldwide.
[00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:39.281]  Being run by the people that control Joe Biden.
[00:48:39.281 --> 00:48:41.943]  Told you about that Monday, it broke yesterday.
[00:48:41.943 --> 00:48:43.804]  So it's all coming out.
[00:48:43.804 --> 00:48:44.985]  They can't stop any of it.
[00:48:46.067 --> 00:48:53.111]  They're in full panic mode and the deep state said, you've got to get rid of Carlson.
[00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:56.974]  But now how do they feel with him even bigger?
[00:48:56.974 --> 00:49:01.156]  And I would advise Carlson to keep doing monologues every night at eight.
[00:49:01.156 --> 00:49:02.177]  I told you to look for that.
[00:49:02.177 --> 00:49:05.379]  That'd be the first thing he'd do and to launch his own system.
[00:49:05.379 --> 00:49:06.820]  So he totally controls it.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:11.342]  And I predict you'll see that the latest by January of next year.
[00:49:11.342 --> 00:49:15.245]  So within six, seven months,
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.760]  Eight months.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.461]  I predict you will see that.
[00:49:19.461 --> 00:49:20.981]  You heard it here first.
[00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:31.184]  Just like I told you in March of last year, excuse me, of this year, a month and a half ago, that I believe he'll be fired from FOX in the next few months.
[00:49:31.184 --> 00:49:37.086]  And that was an easy call.
[00:49:37.086 --> 00:49:37.826]  Yeah, good riddance.
[00:49:37.826 --> 00:49:41.948]  Pentagon officials, cheer Tucker Carlson's ouster.
[00:49:41.948 --> 00:49:42.588]  Here's the story.
[00:49:42.588 --> 00:49:44.809]  Paul Joseph Watson, InfoWars.com today.
[00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:45.849]  Suggest you read it and share it.
[00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:47.833]  Ex-U.S.
[00:49:47.833 --> 00:49:55.136]  Army PSYOPS expert, Fox News, fired Carlson to maintain, quote, semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[00:49:55.136 --> 00:49:57.817]  No, they're actually just in a trance.
[00:49:57.817 --> 00:49:58.597]  A former U.S.
[00:49:58.597 --> 00:50:07.580]  Army psychological warfare officer says that Tucker Carlson was fired by Fox News because of the regime's agenda to maintain a uniform, semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[00:50:08.373 --> 00:50:09.714]  The remarks were made by U.S.
[00:50:09.714 --> 00:50:11.916]  counterterrorism expert Scott Bennett.
[00:50:11.916 --> 00:50:21.145]  Carlson said Fox News parted ways on Monday with the speculation still raging as to the specific reason why the network scanned its highest-rated, most popular host.
[00:50:21.145 --> 00:50:22.086]  Well, he was the reason.
[00:50:23.117 --> 00:50:25.237]  That it was so popular and it was waking people up.
[00:50:25.237 --> 00:50:25.718]  That's why.
[00:50:25.718 --> 00:50:34.179]  According to Bennett, Carlson posed too much of a threat to the institutional power because he turned Americans into proper researchers and thinkers.
[00:50:34.179 --> 00:50:35.120]  Yes.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.600]  That's it.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.080]  What he would do in the future.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.660]  What he would inspire.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:46.802]  Carlson offered an intellectualism, truthfulness, and an analytical depth that no other news personality has ever done in the history of the United States as far back as I can remember, said Bennett.
[00:50:48.018 --> 00:51:05.770]  Tucker needed to be silenced because he represented too big a threat to the powers and principalities, institutions, and agencies that seek to unenlighten, uninform, simulabotimize quasi-retarded populations that do not question, do not research, do not analyze, but simply digest and follow instructions, according to Bennett.
[00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:06.991]  Tucker Carlson exposed the...
[00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:14.075]  Broad and money-laundering, racketeering crimes of FDX, the Democratic Party in Ukraine, involvement in the United States government.
[00:51:14.075 --> 00:51:14.836]  He exposed the U.S.
[00:51:14.836 --> 00:51:17.738]  policy of weapons labs in Ukraine and other connections to the Democratic Party.
[00:51:17.738 --> 00:51:22.082]  Presidents Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Bill Gates, and other U.S.
[00:51:22.082 --> 00:51:24.043]  government agencies and pharmaceutical companies.
[00:51:24.043 --> 00:51:26.105]  Bennett told the news.
[00:51:26.105 --> 00:51:34.572]  The ex-host's anti-regime rhetoric could no longer be tolerated by the corrupt American media and political establishment, said Bennett, adding that his exit signals the death of American media.
[00:51:35.609 --> 00:51:36.169]  The U.S.
[00:51:36.169 --> 00:51:47.831]  former Army PSY officer suggested that Senator Chuck Schumer had threatened to utilize the CIA and FBI to deploy secret government operations against Tucker to get him off the air unless he was fired.
[00:51:47.831 --> 00:51:49.111]  Oh, yeah.
[00:51:49.111 --> 00:51:52.112]  That was Strom Thurmond ordered.
[00:51:52.112 --> 00:51:53.592]  John Lennon murdered.
[00:51:53.592 --> 00:52:03.774]  Schumer previously called on Carlson to be taken off the air after broadcast footage showing January 6th riot leaders were actually allowed in the Capitol and chaperoned around by authorities.
[00:52:03.774 --> 00:52:04.194]  It goes on.
[00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:06.252]  That's truth.
[00:52:06.252 --> 00:52:07.532]  That's dead on.
[00:52:07.532 --> 00:52:11.694]  That's important.
[00:52:11.694 --> 00:52:23.840]  And there's so many other facets to all of this, but the good news is we're all Alex Jones now.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:29.443]  Whether you think Musk is an opportunist, good or bad, he knows which way the wind's blowing.
[00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:32.262]  Tucker Carlson, I can tell you, is good.
[00:52:32.262 --> 00:52:33.083]  He knows where it's going.
[00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.143]  He's totally committed.
[00:52:34.143 --> 00:52:39.226]  And many other people, not just the grassroots listeners of this show, people that have been fighting forever.
[00:52:39.226 --> 00:52:47.271]  Yes, we're the first big wave that the tiny little patriot groups in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s helped generate.
[00:52:47.271 --> 00:52:55.295]  That was the little wave, but the key wave, mainly of former intelligence operatives, FBI agents, and people that were on the inside and saw it.
[00:52:55.295 --> 00:52:56.436]  Great men, great women.
[00:52:57.557 --> 00:53:00.499]  Congressional whistleblowers, Anthony Sutton, the list goes on and on.
[00:53:00.499 --> 00:53:04.121]  That was the first wave, very small, but critical.
[00:53:04.121 --> 00:53:11.206]  Just like you plant one tree, if you lived there for 200, 300 years, you'd see that that one oak tree drops acorns, more grow, more grow.
[00:53:11.206 --> 00:53:14.969]  If they're not cut down, a whole forest grows from one oak tree.
[00:53:14.969 --> 00:53:19.252]  So that first wave, 50, 60 years ago, was one oak.
[00:53:19.252 --> 00:53:21.693]  Now it's a forest.
[00:53:21.693 --> 00:53:24.895]  And it's growing, and growing, and growing, and they can't stop it.
[00:53:24.895 --> 00:53:25.696]  They can't defeat it.
[00:53:28.564 --> 00:53:38.986]  And so I was part of the second wave at the very beginning and crested in the last few years.
[00:53:38.986 --> 00:53:44.167]  But as my wave crashes, it only pushes the next wave up and I'll be part of the next wave.
[00:53:44.167 --> 00:53:44.747]  And so will you.
[00:53:44.747 --> 00:53:46.528]  It's not about who's most popular.
[00:53:46.528 --> 00:53:48.628]  It's not about who makes the most money.
[00:53:48.628 --> 00:53:51.108]  It's about who is effective at fighting the enemy.
[00:53:51.108 --> 00:53:53.329]  And I told you
[00:53:54.631 --> 00:54:00.493]  Looking at Carlson, what he was doing, talking to him, working with him, that he was going to really be critical.
[00:54:00.493 --> 00:54:04.635]  And he knew that he wasn't backing down.
[00:54:04.635 --> 00:54:07.256]  He knew that he was pushing the envelope.
[00:54:07.256 --> 00:54:09.637]  He knew this was coming.
[00:54:09.637 --> 00:54:13.558]  And he was already preparing.
[00:54:13.558 --> 00:54:20.761]  And that's why you see the photos out of Florida with he and his wife driving around in the golf cart having a great time.
[00:54:22.503 --> 00:54:24.505]  Because he's not part of the predators.
[00:54:24.505 --> 00:54:26.646]  He's not part of the devil worshippers.
[00:54:26.646 --> 00:54:29.168]  He's not part of the Satanists.
[00:54:29.168 --> 00:54:30.309]  He's not part of the pedophilia.
[00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:32.111]  He's not part of imploding the borders.
[00:54:32.111 --> 00:54:33.252]  He's not part of the fentanyl.
[00:54:33.252 --> 00:54:35.073]  He can sleep at night.
[00:54:35.073 --> 00:54:36.134]  He's honorable.
[00:54:36.134 --> 00:54:37.255]  He feels good.
[00:54:37.255 --> 00:54:41.859]  And he sees victory in his lifetime.
[00:54:41.859 --> 00:54:46.703]  So you have to have that attitude of not caring what the enemy says about you and how they bully you and what they do and what they pull.
[00:54:46.703 --> 00:54:50.166]  The more they attack, you've got to realize you are having an effect
[00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:59.243]  And it's not going to fulfill you just to play golf and eat food and party.
[00:54:59.243 --> 00:55:01.983]  And there's certainly a place for that when you work for liberty and freedom.
[00:55:01.983 --> 00:55:02.864]  Work hard, play hard.
[00:55:02.864 --> 00:55:04.664]  But the work is freedom.
[00:55:04.664 --> 00:55:11.986]  It's not a debate with the left who's here to destroy us and enslave us and create their supremacist system of transhumanism.
[00:55:11.986 --> 00:55:13.807]  It's an honor to fight these people.
[00:55:13.807 --> 00:55:17.488]  It's a delicious delicacy.
[00:55:17.488 --> 00:55:20.409]  It is splendor.
[00:55:20.409 --> 00:55:21.429]  It is amazing.
[00:55:22.668 --> 00:55:25.270]  It is so good.
[00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:29.052]  And it's what we were all really born for, this choice we're making right now.
[00:55:29.052 --> 00:55:29.852]  All right, let me do this.
[00:55:29.852 --> 00:55:30.372]  We've got a break.
[00:55:30.372 --> 00:55:31.293]  Bring in our special guest.
[00:55:31.293 --> 00:55:33.674]  Cover all this other huge world news unfolding.
[00:55:33.674 --> 00:55:34.655]  Talk about the big picture.
[00:55:34.655 --> 00:55:38.597]  Look at the different details unfolding.
[00:55:38.597 --> 00:55:40.598]  But remember, I'm not funded by the globalists.
[00:55:40.598 --> 00:55:42.539]  I'm not funded by the New World Order.
[00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:43.380]  I don't have a war chest.
[00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:51.251]  But I do have, we the people, and I've expended my energy and my focus to get the ball into the end zone.
[00:55:51.251 --> 00:55:52.432]  With your help, we've done it.
[00:55:52.432 --> 00:56:00.196]  And now we have possession of the ball again, and we're marching down towards the one-yard line again.
[00:56:00.196 --> 00:56:02.237]  But I need your prayers, and I really mean that.
[00:56:02.237 --> 00:56:03.377]  Pray for me.
[00:56:03.377 --> 00:56:06.339]  And pray for Awakening, and pray for others, and pray for Tucker, and pray for Trump.
[00:56:06.339 --> 00:56:06.839]  He's not perfect.
[00:56:08.396 --> 00:56:20.302]  And support the broadcast and spread the word and share the articles and share the videos and take clips out and put them on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and just keep hammering it because I see our work everywhere in many ways bigger than it's ever been.
[00:56:20.302 --> 00:56:27.646]  And I see God working through all of you and I commend you and salute you and ask you to realize you stand between all of us in the New World Order.
[00:56:27.646 --> 00:56:30.747]  You're just as important as I am or Tucker or anybody else.
[00:56:30.747 --> 00:56:31.668]  And you know you're for real.
[00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:35.946]  So share the article, share the videos, and don't procrastinate.
[00:56:35.946 --> 00:56:45.022]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, get the Prebiotic Fighter, get Turbo Force Plus back in stock, get the Ultimate Crystal Oil, get... a lot of that stuff sold out, the DNA Force and the...
[00:56:46.277 --> 00:56:57.826]  The Tumor Toothpaste, but we've got the Trump Political Prisoner Shirt, the Alex Jones for President Shirt, Real Red Pill Selling Out, amazing what it does for your body, your energy, your immune system, your youth.
[00:56:57.826 --> 00:57:06.332]  It's 40% off Real Red Pill Plus, InfowarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:06.332 --> 00:57:12.637]  And finally, two great products, Infowars Platinum, private labels of the very best already top-selling products in the country.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:27.786]  Natural High Quality Pain Reduction with Pain MD and 1776 Testosterone Boost that helps the natural testosterone in your body stay free in the body so it lasts longer, has a bigger effect, and helps boost natural testosterone in other ways.
[00:57:27.786 --> 00:57:34.929]  1776 Testosterone Boost at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:34.929 --> 00:57:36.610]  But now is the battle!
[00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:39.611]  And don't take InfoWars for granted, because the enemy is
[00:57:41.243 --> 00:57:42.086]  Going after folks.
[00:57:42.086 --> 00:57:46.719]  You heard that former intelligence level operative saying they turned the CIA loose on Fox.
[00:57:46.719 --> 00:57:47.381]  It wasn't just Tucker.
[00:57:50.168 --> 00:57:55.190]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.351]  We made it even stronger.
[00:57:57.351 --> 00:58:01.093]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:01.093 --> 00:58:06.235]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:06.235 --> 00:58:14.078]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:58:14.078 --> 00:58:15.499]  It could be called 10-hour energy.
[00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:29.227]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:58:29.227 --> 00:58:31.228]  It is the super fuel.
[00:58:31.228 --> 00:58:32.709]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:33.549]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:34.530]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:35.711]  They go good with this.
[00:58:35.711 --> 00:58:37.732]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:58:38.453 --> 00:58:39.936]  This is the Boss.
[00:58:39.936 --> 00:58:40.657]  TurboForce.
[00:58:40.657 --> 00:58:41.700]  Back in stock.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:42.722]  Discounted.
[00:58:42.722 --> 00:58:44.425]  M4WarStore.com.
[00:58:44.425 --> 00:58:45.307]  More power.
[00:58:45.307 --> 00:58:46.308]  More strength.
[00:58:46.308 --> 00:58:46.809]  More energy.
[00:58:49.932 --> 00:58:57.356]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:58:57.356 --> 00:59:00.178]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:59:00.178 --> 00:59:08.523]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:59:08.523 --> 00:59:10.944]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:59:10.944 --> 00:59:13.946]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:59:14.266 --> 00:59:16.848]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:59:16.848 --> 00:59:25.253]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[00:59:25.253 --> 00:59:27.095]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[00:59:27.095 --> 00:59:33.719]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:59:34.179 --> 00:59:39.361]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:59:39.361 --> 00:59:45.482]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[00:59:45.482 --> 00:59:53.364]  Available now at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:59:53.364 --> 00:59:57.286]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:08.084]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:08.084 --> 01:00:12.407]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.407 --> 01:00:14.488]  Good evening, it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:00:14.488 --> 01:00:21.732]  One of the first things you realize when you step outside the noise for a few days is how many genuinely nice people there are in this country.
[01:00:21.732 --> 01:00:22.893]  Kind and decent people.
[01:00:22.893 --> 01:00:25.514]  People who really care about what's true.
[01:00:25.514 --> 01:00:28.296]  And a bunch of hilarious people, also.
[01:00:28.296 --> 01:00:29.477]  A lot of those.
[01:00:29.477 --> 01:00:31.498]  It's gotta be the majority of the population, even now.
[01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:33.702]  So that's heartening.
[01:00:33.702 --> 01:00:41.425]  The other thing you notice when you take a little time off is how unbelievably stupid most of the debates you see on television are.
[01:00:41.425 --> 01:00:42.986]  They're completely irrelevant.
[01:00:42.986 --> 01:00:44.406]  They mean nothing.
[01:00:44.406 --> 01:00:47.248]  In five years we won't even remember that we had them.
[01:00:47.248 --> 01:00:49.849]  Trust me as someone who's participated.
[01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:59.373]  And yet at the same time, and this is the amazing thing, the undeniably big topics, the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all.
[01:00:59.373 --> 01:00:59.613]  War.
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:07.286]  Civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, natural resources.
[01:01:07.286 --> 01:01:11.689]  When was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues?
[01:01:11.689 --> 01:01:13.351]  It's been a long time.
[01:01:13.351 --> 01:01:16.734]  Debates like that are not permitted in American media.
[01:01:16.734 --> 01:01:25.941]  Both political parties and their donors have reached consensus on what benefits them, and they actively collude to shut down any conversation about it.
[01:01:26.815 --> 01:01:31.098]  Suddenly, the United States looks very much like a one-party state.
[01:01:31.098 --> 01:01:33.080]  That's a depressing realization.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.701]  But it's not permanent.
[01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:37.663]  Our current orthodoxies won't last.
[01:01:37.663 --> 01:01:39.024]  They're brain dead.
[01:01:39.024 --> 01:01:41.186]  Nobody actually believes them.
[01:01:41.186 --> 01:01:44.308]  Hardly anyone's life is improved by them.
[01:01:44.308 --> 01:01:47.631]  This moment is too inherently ridiculous to continue.
[01:01:47.631 --> 01:01:49.312]  And so it won't.
[01:01:49.312 --> 01:01:50.553]  The people in charge know this.
[01:01:50.553 --> 01:01:52.794]  That's why they're hysterical and aggressive.
[01:01:52.794 --> 01:01:53.415]  They're afraid.
[01:01:54.246 --> 01:01:57.727]  They've given up persuasion, they're resorting to force.
[01:01:57.727 --> 01:01:59.167]  But it won't work.
[01:01:59.167 --> 01:02:05.788]  When honest people say what's true, calmly and without embarrassment, they become powerful.
[01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:11.590]  At the same time, the liars who've been trying to silence them shrink, and they become weaker.
[01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:13.390]  That's the iron law of the universe.
[01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:15.811]  True things prevail.
[01:02:15.811 --> 01:02:19.051]  Where can you still find Americans saying true things?
[01:02:19.051 --> 01:02:22.152]  There aren't many places left, but there are some, and that's enough.
[01:02:23.038 --> 01:02:26.279]  As long as you can hear the words, there is hope.
[01:02:26.279 --> 01:02:26.679]  See you soon.
[01:02:47.918 --> 01:02:48.318]  They're not!
[01:02:48.318 --> 01:02:54.724]  Yeah, this is why I'm so glad you're covering this case, Tucker, because this is the tactic that tyrants always use.
[01:02:54.724 --> 01:03:00.109]  When they want to implement an authoritarian precedent, they choose people that makes others uncomfortable.
[01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:11.279]  When they wanted to start banning people from the internet, they chose Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones because they knew that even Republicans would say, I don't want to defend those people, they're a bridge too far, and then the precedent gets set and they expand it inward.
[01:03:11.639 --> 01:03:17.602]  Again, these are not people the kind of black radicals Democratic Party establishment representatives like.
[01:03:17.602 --> 01:03:21.164]  They're people who attack the Biden administration, who don't vote Democrat.
[01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:25.487]  These are real dissidents, and they know that not even Democrats will defend them.
[01:03:25.487 --> 01:03:28.968]  No, they're not taking money from Apple and Facebook.
[01:03:28.968 --> 01:03:30.389]  They weren't in on the BLM scam.
[01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:31.950]  They actually mean it.
[01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.211]  Now you're making me like them.
[01:03:33.211 --> 01:03:35.172]  Glenn Greenwald, I appreciate your coming on.
[01:03:35.672 --> 01:03:43.639]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[01:03:43.639 --> 01:03:49.444]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[01:03:49.444 --> 01:03:51.786]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:57.190]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:58.531]  The social media giants.
[01:03:58.531 --> 01:03:58.932]  And they are.
[01:03:59.272 --> 01:04:04.999]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:09.845]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:17.474]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:23.656]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:04:23.656 --> 01:04:30.678]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[01:04:30.678 --> 01:04:40.481]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:42.602]  People know what's true.
[01:04:42.602 --> 01:04:43.943]  They can smell it.
[01:04:43.943 --> 01:04:45.365]  InfoWars.
[01:04:45.365 --> 01:04:49.368]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:51.390]  In a free country, everyone can be hurt.
[01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:54.933]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be hurt.
[01:05:00.148 --> 01:05:05.171]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[01:05:05.171 --> 01:05:07.352]  We made it even stronger.
[01:05:07.352 --> 01:05:11.094]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:05:11.094 --> 01:05:17.978]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:17.978 --> 01:05:24.061]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:05:24.061 --> 01:05:25.502]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:05:26.142 --> 01:05:39.232]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:05:39.232 --> 01:05:41.213]  It is the super fuel.
[01:05:41.213 --> 01:05:42.694]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:05:42.694 --> 01:05:43.535]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:05:43.535 --> 01:05:44.516]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:05:44.516 --> 01:05:45.696]  They go good with this.
[01:05:45.696 --> 01:05:47.718]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:05:48.436 --> 01:05:49.917]  This is the Boss.
[01:05:49.917 --> 01:05:50.657]  TurboForce.
[01:05:50.657 --> 01:05:51.678]  Back in stock.
[01:05:51.678 --> 01:05:52.678]  Discounted.
[01:05:52.678 --> 01:05:54.419]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:54.419 --> 01:05:55.300]  More power.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.280]  More strength.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:56.801]  More energy.
[01:06:16.565 --> 01:06:30.731]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:40.455]  And we are now into our number two, and Brian Rose is a fellow American that launched this very popular TV show and programs out of London, England, is with us in studio.
[01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:43.816]  He was here for the big blockchain event that's been ongoing in Austin.
[01:06:43.816 --> 01:06:45.857]  Brian Rose is founder, host, and CEO of London Real.
[01:06:46.477 --> 01:06:46.797]  We're good to go.
[01:07:02.168 --> 01:07:06.331]  To turn London Real into a new generation media business with over half a billion views.
[01:07:06.331 --> 01:07:08.212]  More than that now, 2 million subscribers.
[01:07:08.212 --> 01:07:14.215]  Brian has conducted over 500 in-depth interviews and is an antidote to the numbing effects of the mainstream media.
[01:07:14.215 --> 01:07:20.819]  Brian also founded London Real Academy, offering live partnership, mentorship, and courses designed to help you transform yourself.
[01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:21.900]  LondonReal.tv.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.142]  I learned he was in Austin yesterday, so I asked him to come on the show.
[01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:29.805]  Perfect time to have him on for a big 35,000 foot view on the economy, Ukraine, the wars,
[01:07:30.305 --> 01:07:34.190]  The huge awakening that's happening, but obviously first and foremost, thanks for being here.
[01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:37.194]  Let's get into Tucker Carlson.
[01:07:37.194 --> 01:07:48.048]  I mean, 60-something million views on Twitter, hundreds of millions of views, top story, everything he said now magnified, the entire anti-globalist agenda exploding everywhere, the deep state panicking,
[01:07:48.428 --> 01:07:52.530]  This is emblematic of them not thinking multi-moves ahead.
[01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:55.351]  What would it do if they fired Carlson?
[01:07:55.351 --> 01:07:56.732]  People keep asking why they fired him.
[01:07:56.732 --> 01:07:58.113]  The answer is the show.
[01:07:58.113 --> 01:07:58.873]  Everything he did.
[01:07:58.873 --> 01:08:06.017]  And I've talked about the inside baseball, without giving away too much, but he had a contract that he got a third of the money he would have gotten if they controlled his show.
[01:08:06.017 --> 01:08:10.059]  So he took $20 million instead of $60 million to have control, but they kept taking control.
[01:08:10.059 --> 01:08:14.401]  And so that's why I said on March 8th, I think Tucker will be gone in a few months.
[01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:16.442]  Did he know it was coming at that time?
[01:08:16.442 --> 01:08:21.505]  No, but he expected it and he's definitely been researching and how to launch his own operation.
[01:08:21.505 --> 01:08:26.109]  You saw him just on an iPhone last night, the top story, hundreds of millions of views.
[01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:35.175]  That has got to really be emblematic of the entire cable news system for three or four days won't have that many views.
[01:08:35.175 --> 01:08:40.238]  This has really got to illustrate that this is a facade.
[01:08:40.238 --> 01:08:41.659]  This is a paper tiger.
[01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:42.780]  So give us your take on that.
[01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:46.377]  Well, I think it's a beautiful thing and it was only a matter of time before Tucker broke out.
[01:08:46.377 --> 01:08:51.838]  And like you said, he's going to be bigger than ever once he gets his own platform and there'll be a studio like yours here.
[01:08:51.838 --> 01:08:54.659]  And it just goes to show where this is all headed.
[01:08:54.659 --> 01:08:56.699]  You know, independent media is a beautiful thing.
[01:08:56.699 --> 01:09:02.701]  You encouraged me to set up my own platform three years ago because we were getting shut down by the big tech platforms.
[01:09:02.701 --> 01:09:06.261]  And you always said, Brian, once I got shut down from them, I became bigger than ever.
[01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:08.162]  And I think Tucker is going to be bigger than ever as well.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.480]  You're a smart guy.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.402]  I can ask a lot of questions, but keep digging into that.
[01:09:13.402 --> 01:09:18.244]  I mean, your view on this, what you're seeing happening, did the establishment think he would just disappear?
[01:09:18.244 --> 01:09:20.766]  No, they know better.
[01:09:20.766 --> 01:09:27.509]  And like I said, he's going to have even more control, more power if he can get this next set up right, and he'll be an even bigger voice.
[01:09:27.509 --> 01:09:28.869]  So I guess you saw this coming.
[01:09:28.869 --> 01:09:30.830]  I didn't know it was going to happen so fast.
[01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:37.854]  It still flabbergasted me that they would throw away that kind of impact, those kind of views, that kind of connection.
[01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:42.382]  But how much longer is mainstream media going to even be around at this point?
[01:09:42.382 --> 01:09:49.636]  Well that's what most people are saying is Fox News is dead, cable news is already dead, so the last dinosaur has basically fallen into the mud and is dead.
[01:09:50.353 --> 01:10:00.802]  And then not to mention what we call these Web 2 platforms, everything from Facebook to the YouTubes, while Twitter is still debatable, how much longer are those going to be around where people can't have direct relationships with their fan base?
[01:10:00.802 --> 01:10:12.412]  That's kind of why I'm in town for the Blockchain Conference, where people can actually have a direct relationship, cut out the middlemen, ultimately cut out the banks, cut out the governments, so we can really finally have a system where we can go peer-to-peer.
[01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:14.754]  I think that's where Tucker's heading, and I think this is a really good sign.
[01:10:15.054 --> 01:10:15.854]  Well, that's right, was it?
[01:10:15.854 --> 01:10:24.677]  Three, three and a half years ago, you were routinely getting two, three million, four million views on your show on YouTube, and they started censoring you, and I just, I mean, it wasn't rocket science.
[01:10:24.677 --> 01:10:26.277]  I said, you got to launch your own thing.
[01:10:26.277 --> 01:10:27.057]  You got to do it now.
[01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:32.099]  And you did it just in a few months, and it's been even more successful, and you're still able to be on all those other platforms.
[01:10:32.099 --> 01:10:36.420]  Because as soon as you have your own thing, then they have a lot of trouble making the move to shut you down.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.120]  It was a pivotal moment, you know.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.981]  It was April 6, 2020, Alex.
[01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:42.482]  I had the second largest YouTube livestream in the world.
[01:10:42.482 --> 01:10:46.163]  65,000 people tuned in to watch that conversation I had with David Icke.
[01:10:46.163 --> 01:10:49.244]  That's at any one time, so yeah, then it builds up from there.
[01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:49.884]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:49.884 --> 01:10:50.444]  It was massive.
[01:10:50.444 --> 01:10:53.465]  It would have gone on to be the most watched podcast in human history.
[01:10:53.465 --> 01:10:55.446]  Would have gone on to be watched maybe 40 million times.
[01:10:55.446 --> 01:10:59.567]  Would have edged out what at the time was Rogan and Musk, about 30 million.
[01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:02.968]  And yet, 30 minutes later, YouTube banned and deleted that conversation.
[01:11:03.348 --> 01:11:10.875]  Alex, I've been broadcasting for nine years, never once have I been censored, and that started this massive, massive fight that we had with these platforms.
[01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:18.442]  So is it safe to say, by you not rolling over, because I know you had a chance, I know they approach people, I'm guessing they approach you, hey, just roll over, we'll leave you alone.
[01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:21.243]  Then you didn't roll over and became even more successful?
[01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:21.863]  Is that what happened?
[01:11:21.863 --> 01:11:23.064]  That's exactly what happened.
[01:11:23.064 --> 01:11:41.871]  And I have recorded conversations of me with my YouTube representatives that are going to be in our documentary film that's coming out, where I can literally see them basically violating laws, violating freedom of speech issues, going with their policy and completely contradicting themselves as they tried to censor me repeatedly throughout that time.
[01:11:41.871 --> 01:11:48.353]  We created our own platform, got bigger than ever, and now they've slowly acquiesced a little bit, but it's only going to come back
[01:11:48.453 --> 01:11:48.833]  Exactly.
[01:11:48.833 --> 01:11:52.634]  These bullies and tyrants just run over you if you give in to them.
[01:11:52.634 --> 01:11:53.734]  You have to defeat them.
[01:11:53.734 --> 01:11:54.515]  They're not God.
[01:11:54.515 --> 01:11:56.195]  There's not just bad people in the world.
[01:11:56.195 --> 01:11:57.055]  There's people that want freedom.
[01:11:57.055 --> 01:12:03.277]  And I think the public now gets how serious things are, that there is a deep state, there is a uniparty, not just here, but different countries.
[01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:11.379]  And as that awakening happens, I don't see how they're going to reverse this other than, I guess, a nuclear war, a controlled power outage, a cyber attack.
[01:12:11.379 --> 01:12:13.980]  I mean, how do you think these corrupt interests
[01:12:14.781 --> 01:12:16.462]  Grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[01:12:33.328 --> 01:12:34.308]  There's nothing there.
[01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:38.069]  It's like, you know, it's like there's just somebody behind the curtain.
[01:12:38.069 --> 01:12:39.229]  It's like Neo and the Matrix.
[01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:40.090]  Yeah, it is.
[01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:46.991]  And once you see it and blast through it, then their power diminishes and the people are like, wait a second, it's just a few people that's controlling this.
[01:12:46.991 --> 01:12:50.212]  And once you push out, everyone can realize that we can't fight back.
[01:12:50.212 --> 01:12:51.652]  But we got some real issues to consider.
[01:12:51.652 --> 01:12:52.252]  No, I agree.
[01:12:52.252 --> 01:12:55.433]  It's not like we've won the war yet, but we're starting to win battle after battle after battle.
[01:12:55.433 --> 01:12:58.674]  It's like George Washington lost almost all the battles of the last year.
[01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:00.034]  They started winning them.
[01:13:00.534 --> 01:13:02.916]  I think we're crossing over that point, but I don't want to be overconfident.
[01:13:02.916 --> 01:13:04.496]  I'm going to ask the question again.
[01:13:04.496 --> 01:13:07.158]  What do you think the deep state is going to do to try to stop us?
[01:13:07.158 --> 01:13:10.680]  So I'm really concerned about artificial intelligence coming up here.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.740]  I don't know if they can control it.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:16.283]  They're going to try to control it, but I really think it's something we all need to really wake up and think about it.
[01:13:16.283 --> 01:13:17.944]  I've been going really deep on this lately, Alex.
[01:13:17.944 --> 01:13:21.666]  I've been having a lot of experts on my show looking at some of these companies and the tech.
[01:13:21.666 --> 01:13:28.049]  Quite frankly, it's frightening, and I don't think the public has their eye on it yet, and it's going to come very, very fast.
[01:13:28.049 --> 01:13:28.810]  Exponential growth.
[01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:31.651]  And you've been a big financial guy, a big banker, so you understand this stuff.
[01:13:31.651 --> 01:13:39.133]  Explain to them really what AI is, because they advertise it as God, it's going to fix everything, but really it's whatever these people program in us.
[01:13:39.133 --> 01:13:39.693]  Yeah.
[01:13:39.693 --> 01:13:43.655]  First of all, it's been the largest adoption of technology in human history.
[01:13:43.655 --> 01:13:49.296]  This chat GPT thing went from zero to a million users in four days, went to a hundred million users in two months.
[01:13:49.296 --> 01:13:50.797]  That's unprecedented.
[01:13:50.797 --> 01:13:51.597]  We've never seen that.
[01:13:51.597 --> 01:13:53.398]  Not the internet, not the mobile phone.
[01:13:53.398 --> 01:13:56.899]  This is potentially going to make humans obsolete.
[01:13:57.239 --> 01:14:03.106]  And I think we need to be aware of that and try to make sure it's not controlled by the big tech companies or government.
[01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:09.694]  We need to find a way to decentralize it and understand it or it's really going to take over and it's going to happen very quickly, Alex, within years.
[01:14:09.694 --> 01:14:10.215]  Well, absolutely.
[01:14:10.215 --> 01:14:13.679]  You know, the globalists claim they want a worldwide government to stop disruptive technology.
[01:14:14.631 --> 01:14:23.513]  But at the same time, they're just racing ahead like mad scientists to get technology to control us, when the technology they're creating is obviously the threat to them and us.
[01:14:23.513 --> 01:14:24.954]  It makes no sense.
[01:14:24.954 --> 01:14:26.354]  Yeah, and they can't control this.
[01:14:26.354 --> 01:14:27.754]  That's the other issue.
[01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:30.335]  Now, I've had people come to me and say, Brian, you're taking this out of context.
[01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:33.236]  When tractors came, then it made workers more productive.
[01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:36.176]  When the computer came, it made the rest of us more productive.
[01:14:36.176 --> 01:14:38.557]  But artificial intelligence can improve on itself.
[01:14:38.998 --> 01:14:41.867]  And it will potentially make all of us obsolete in which we can do something about it.
[01:14:41.867 --> 01:14:44.736]  So, I don't think the government really knows what they're playing with here.
[01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:45.987]  Oh, they don't.
[01:14:45.987 --> 01:14:51.228]  It's a mad gold rush where they're just trying to be the leader in it, as Elon Musk said, so there's no controls.
[01:14:51.228 --> 01:14:51.868]  Yeah.
[01:14:51.868 --> 01:14:52.169]  Yeah.
[01:14:52.169 --> 01:14:53.769]  And Elon knows it better than anybody.
[01:14:53.769 --> 01:14:57.850]  He set up OpenAI in 2018, so it would be open source, non-profit.
[01:14:57.850 --> 01:14:59.170]  Of course, that got co-opted.
[01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:00.470]  It's no longer open source.
[01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:01.811]  Microsoft now controls it.
[01:15:01.811 --> 01:15:03.211]  He's trying to set up his own.
[01:15:03.211 --> 01:15:06.092]  He at least is trying to move forward on freedom of speech.
[01:15:06.092 --> 01:15:07.732]  It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out.
[01:15:07.732 --> 01:15:11.353]  But this is a real war, and it's happening now, probably in the next six months.
[01:15:12.602 --> 01:15:24.707]  When we come back, I want to ask you about AI and the economy and the wars, but also first Elon Musk, because obviously he's deep inside the establishment, but there's fissures in the establishment and we have to expect it.
[01:15:24.707 --> 01:15:30.249]  As humanity wants freedom and we stand up and speak out, we have to be ready for big dogs in the system to join us.
[01:15:30.249 --> 01:15:33.951]  We can't be like, oh, we don't trust you now because you weren't with us before.
[01:15:33.951 --> 01:15:36.472]  No, I mean, as the worm turns, we have to be ready for victory.
[01:15:37.349 --> 01:15:38.149]  Very much so.
[01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:46.372]  And again, some people you think have one agenda, it flips into another agenda, and pretty soon they're actually exposing great tools that we can use in our agenda.
[01:15:46.372 --> 01:15:48.713]  I totally agree, because here's how I put it.
[01:15:48.713 --> 01:15:54.275]  The things Elon Musk is doing is so damaging to the globalist model, it's irreversible.
[01:15:54.275 --> 01:15:55.935]  They would not do this.
[01:15:55.935 --> 01:15:58.136]  What he's doing is crossing lines they don't cross.
[01:15:59.144 --> 01:16:05.129]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:16:05.129 --> 01:16:07.771]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:09.952]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:16:09.952 --> 01:16:12.534]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:15.777]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:16:15.777 --> 01:16:17.538]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:16:17.538 --> 01:16:24.163]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:26.946]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:16:27.915 --> 01:16:30.018]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:34.663]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:16:34.663 --> 01:16:38.388]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:16:38.388 --> 01:16:43.714]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage you as listeners to understand, please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:16:44.074 --> 01:16:45.416]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:16:45.416 --> 01:16:51.205]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:16:51.205 --> 01:16:57.955]  So don't procrastinate, go to InfoWareStore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit to these tyrants.
[01:16:58.857 --> 01:17:05.524]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:17:05.524 --> 01:17:07.466]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:17:07.466 --> 01:17:08.968]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:17:08.968 --> 01:17:11.751]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:17:11.751 --> 01:17:13.773]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:17:14.554 --> 01:17:16.514]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:17:16.514 --> 01:17:18.955]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:17:18.955 --> 01:17:21.096]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:17:21.096 --> 01:17:27.677]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:28.737]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:17:28.737 --> 01:17:32.858]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:17:32.858 --> 01:17:34.459]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:17:34.459 --> 01:17:35.479]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:17:35.479 --> 01:17:38.040]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:38.820]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:39.700]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.242]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:45.123]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:17:45.123 --> 01:17:54.849]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free AAA at 253-3139.
[01:18:06.977 --> 01:18:15.683]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:18:15.683 --> 01:18:17.865]  So support InfoWars store.
[01:18:17.865 --> 01:18:22.288]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[01:18:22.288 --> 01:18:22.788]  I don't know.
[01:18:22.788 --> 01:18:26.351]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:18:26.351 --> 01:18:31.014]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[01:18:31.014 --> 01:18:31.915]  Krill oil.
[01:18:31.915 --> 01:18:36.698]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview
[01:18:36.698 --> 01:18:37.098]  We're good.
[01:18:58.539 --> 01:19:04.264]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[01:19:04.264 --> 01:19:06.946]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:19:06.946 --> 01:19:09.548]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[01:19:09.548 --> 01:19:10.309]  Period.
[01:19:10.309 --> 01:19:11.410]  Case closed.
[01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:12.771]  Out to get you and your family.
[01:19:12.771 --> 01:19:13.332]  We sell.
[01:19:13.752 --> 01:19:21.041]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:28.611]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[01:19:29.412 --> 01:19:33.794]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:19:33.794 --> 01:19:35.334]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:19:35.334 --> 01:19:38.136]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:19:38.136 --> 01:19:43.358]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[01:19:43.358 --> 01:19:48.820]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.481]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:51.901]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:19:51.901 --> 01:19:53.602]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:19:53.602 --> 01:19:56.163]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com.
[01:19:56.163 --> 01:19:57.364]  They're discounted right now.
[01:19:57.364 --> 01:19:58.084]  Finally back in stock.
[01:20:00.481 --> 01:20:06.402]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:14.383 --> 01:20:17.266]  Brian Rose of LondonReal.tv is here with us.
[01:20:17.266 --> 01:20:19.608]  Alex Jones Show on this Thursday edition.
[01:20:19.608 --> 01:20:21.429]  I want to get back into AI.
[01:20:21.429 --> 01:20:23.711]  I want to talk about Ukraine, the economy.
[01:20:23.711 --> 01:20:29.276]  You've been a successful banker and been in high-level major companies, so I know that's some of your expertise.
[01:20:29.276 --> 01:20:33.240]  I want to talk about the economy with you as well, but back to Elon Musk.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.701]  I'm not an apologist for Elon Musk.
[01:20:34.701 --> 01:20:36.583]  I'm not a fanboy.
[01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:37.284]  I'm not a cheerleader.
[01:20:38.064 --> 01:20:47.728]  I just see him going from getting a lot of big government contracts and doing a lot of important work that he was successful at to now branching out and attacking, sterilizing children.
[01:20:47.728 --> 01:20:50.629]  You should go to prison for life until their age of consent.
[01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:56.431]  You know, coming out against the censorship, exposing the illegal government surveillance at Twitter, you know, goes on everywhere else.
[01:20:56.431 --> 01:20:58.112]  I mean, it would take an hour to list it all.
[01:20:58.872 --> 01:21:01.514]  These things are irrevocably damaging them.
[01:21:01.514 --> 01:21:03.214]  I'm watching them come after his companies.
[01:21:03.214 --> 01:21:05.276]  I'm watching his companies get hurt by it.
[01:21:05.276 --> 01:21:07.757]  But still, like a kamikaze, he continues.
[01:21:07.757 --> 01:21:11.819]  We could speculate all day about what's really going on, but this is very exciting.
[01:21:11.819 --> 01:21:13.420]  But you look at what Tucker's doing.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.881]  These are bellwethers or major dominoes to fall.
[01:21:15.881 --> 01:21:21.684]  And I predict out of this desire for free will, this desire for renaissance, that we are not on the cusp.
[01:21:21.684 --> 01:21:25.787]  We've already gone over the top of a snowball that the establishment won't be able to stop.
[01:21:25.787 --> 01:21:26.187]  What do you think?
[01:21:26.889 --> 01:21:30.732]  You know, I think when you start fighting for human rights and for free speeches, it becomes addictive.
[01:21:30.732 --> 01:21:35.875]  So you can look back at a few years ago and look at what Elon was doing and you can have different opinions on that.
[01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:40.758]  But once you get in the fight, Alex, I mean, I was they picked a fight with me back in 2020.
[01:21:40.758 --> 01:21:45.602]  And once they did, I went all in on this, created the platform, started pushing back even harder.
[01:21:45.602 --> 01:21:46.902]  And I think that's what I see in Elon.
[01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:50.585]  I'm telling you, Alex, when he released those Twitter files, I had a moment.
[01:21:51.005 --> 01:21:58.489]  Because I thought I was going crazy, Alex, in April 2020, when I got systematically deplatformed from PayPal, from Dropbox, from LinkedIn.
[01:21:58.489 --> 01:22:01.650]  And I thought, wait a second, is there really a bunch of people acting together?
[01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:02.851]  Then I read the Twitter files.
[01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:05.492]  I saw actors like the CIA, the FBI going in.
[01:22:05.492 --> 01:22:09.914]  What I want to see, Alex, is the YouTube files, because I think they'll be more interesting.
[01:22:09.914 --> 01:22:11.615]  And so, look, my hats are off to Elon.
[01:22:11.615 --> 01:22:12.675]  I think he's with us.
[01:22:12.675 --> 01:22:15.937]  I think he's going to keep pushing forward and throwing a monkey wrench in the establishment.
[01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:17.181]  I agree.
[01:22:17.181 --> 01:22:19.122]  You know, I covered this last hour, but U.S.
[01:22:19.122 --> 01:22:24.105]  Army high-level PsyOps expert, retired, said, look, they're threatening Fox with the CIA.
[01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.445]  They're using the CIA.
[01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:26.706]  I've experienced that myself.
[01:22:26.706 --> 01:22:28.607]  It's come out in congressional hearings.
[01:22:28.607 --> 01:22:29.607]  But what do they do?
[01:22:29.607 --> 01:22:34.930]  They go offer employees money to lie about you, but there's no proof, so it goes nowhere.
[01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:37.972]  That's now come out with this so-called employee suing him.
[01:22:37.972 --> 01:22:40.073]  He never even met her or talked to her.
[01:22:40.073 --> 01:22:41.253]  It's all just made up.
[01:22:41.253 --> 01:22:42.494]  But, I mean, that's the best they've got.
[01:22:42.494 --> 01:22:44.155]  So, oh, a CIA title.
[01:22:44.975 --> 01:22:48.402]  Well, most of the former CIA and a lot of the current are on our side joining us now.
[01:22:48.402 --> 01:22:50.365]  So don't be intimidated by the Deep State, folks.
[01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.387]  It's a joke.
[01:22:51.387 --> 01:22:54.052]  They're working for the collapsing system.
[01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:54.714]  They're the fools.
[01:22:54.714 --> 01:22:55.435]  They're the quizlings.
[01:22:56.038 --> 01:23:00.620]  Well, I mean, this information war, the stakes keep going up and up and up, Alex.
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.761]  And I'm really curious where you think this is going to go.
[01:23:02.761 --> 01:23:08.504]  Because, again, not to drum on about AI again, but we're starting to see deep fakes that are real fakes.
[01:23:08.504 --> 01:23:09.585]  We're starting to see voices.
[01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:11.166]  We're starting to see pictures.
[01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:13.487]  We're starting to see videos that are being created.
[01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:16.568]  And, again, you understand information wars better than anybody here.
[01:23:16.568 --> 01:23:18.249]  Are they taking things to the next level now?
[01:23:18.249 --> 01:23:19.650]  And how are we going to be able to fight back?
[01:23:19.770 --> 01:23:20.270]  It's funny you say that.
[01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.870]  I'm sure you saw it.
[01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:27.231]  It was the Washington Post two weeks ago said the State Department and CIA are now deploying deepfakes for policy.
[01:23:27.231 --> 01:23:30.412]  So they're the ones driving it while they warn us all about it.
[01:23:30.412 --> 01:23:30.852]  Yeah.
[01:23:30.852 --> 01:23:32.312]  I mean this is happening out there.
[01:23:32.312 --> 01:23:39.333]  You've probably seen the headlines about people's family getting kidnapped and them getting AI phone calls from their kids and you know doing the ransom thing.
[01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:43.894]  Right now in Kuwait they have a news anchor who's completely AI and people are buying into that.
[01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:49.615]  In a weird way it feels like us as humans are even being conditioned to be welcoming these things kind of more into our lives.
[01:23:49.735 --> 01:23:53.678]  We should create a human union that says, no, we want human hands to make it.
[01:23:53.678 --> 01:23:56.239]  We want certified if anything's a fact checker, this is human.
[01:24:20.738 --> 01:24:22.143]  The New York Times two weeks ago got caught.
[01:24:22.143 --> 01:24:25.675]  There's thousands of examples just this month where they said that
[01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:30.352]  Edward Snowden worked for Wikileaks and published at Wikileaks.
[01:24:30.352 --> 01:24:31.913]  He didn't publish it there.
[01:24:31.913 --> 01:24:32.894]  He published it elsewhere.
[01:24:32.894 --> 01:24:34.275]  That's a known lines.
[01:24:34.275 --> 01:24:35.716]  And the New York Times said, we don't care.
[01:24:35.716 --> 01:24:40.479]  So they're just planting completely fake things they know to create a false history.
[01:24:40.479 --> 01:24:40.919]  Yeah.
[01:24:40.919 --> 01:24:45.222]  And again, this whole Wayback Machine was supposed to be an exact copy of everything the Internet ever published.
[01:24:45.222 --> 01:24:47.363]  But it looks like that has never been tampered with.
[01:24:47.363 --> 01:24:48.444]  So what do we do going forward?
[01:24:48.444 --> 01:24:49.885]  How do we verify these things?
[01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:56.089]  I think a decentralized ledger where we can all have a copy of that, which means it can't be tweaked or messed with by government.
[01:24:56.089 --> 01:24:56.530]  I agree.
[01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:57.490]  Sure.
[01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:08.402]  There should be pro-verification free speech groups, not their fake fact-checkers that we certify, we believe in, who then separately save the internet, and separately create archives, and then put out certifications.
[01:25:08.402 --> 01:25:10.524]  Yes, has to be going forward.
[01:25:10.524 --> 01:25:12.987]  What do you think Elon's going to do with this going forward?
[01:25:12.987 --> 01:25:14.768]  And where do you think his head lies?
[01:25:14.768 --> 01:25:16.390]  Is he going to keep pushing for freedom of speech?
[01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:19.553]  I mean, every tweet seems like he is on the right side.
[01:25:20.194 --> 01:25:26.302]  Well, I mean, he's releasing the documents that prove the government was running Twitter, and basically that means all the other major ones.
[01:25:26.302 --> 01:25:28.064]  So yeah, it's devastating.
[01:25:28.064 --> 01:25:29.987]  I mean, what he's doing is devastating.
[01:25:29.987 --> 01:25:31.208]  I mean, again, it shows us...
[01:25:32.638 --> 01:25:33.518]  Look, here's an example.
[01:25:33.518 --> 01:25:51.504]  On Monday, I had an extensive meeting with a high-level federal official and federal officers who said, no, the government has tens of thousands and is letting kids be kidnapped, and we have the documents, and here it is, and it's going to be coming out soon, and we want to give you more of this, and this is really in court records.
[01:25:52.543 --> 01:26:03.471]  Let me tell you, when you're sitting there talking to people at that level that are saying, we're done, we're not part of this, the evil's so bad it's going to force a bunch of good people that were on the fence or didn't know what to do to take action.
[01:26:03.471 --> 01:26:08.354]  So I think that's why there's a race to get AI in to head us off at the pass.
[01:26:08.354 --> 01:26:11.937]  Do you see other tech platforms being alarmed by what Elon's doing?
[01:26:11.937 --> 01:26:18.722]  Do you think their policies are coming back a little bit, coming a little bit more to be accepting the free speech right?
[01:26:18.722 --> 01:26:20.183]  And do you think that's temporary if it is?
[01:26:21.559 --> 01:26:23.601]  I have not seen Google or YouTube back off.
[01:26:23.601 --> 01:26:24.461]  They've gotten worse.
[01:26:24.461 --> 01:26:27.784]  But yes, Facebook has backed off a little.
[01:26:27.784 --> 01:26:31.146]  And so have some of the others after Elon.
[01:26:31.146 --> 01:26:35.990]  But I don't know if that's because of policy or because now Twitter is feeding so much truth.
[01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:40.853]  Because folks, Alex Jones is still banned, but the governor's off.
[01:26:40.853 --> 01:26:44.776]  And so, and I don't report that because the enemy already knows that.
[01:26:44.776 --> 01:26:46.718]  But I mean, I can see what he wants.
[01:26:46.718 --> 01:26:47.979]  I mean, Alex Jones is unbanned.
[01:26:49.241 --> 01:26:52.283]  I mean, I don't officially have a Twitter, but I'm unbanned.
[01:26:52.283 --> 01:26:53.844]  So see, I don't go along with what somebody says.
[01:26:53.844 --> 01:26:57.226]  His attack on me was so ridiculous, I can figure it out now later.
[01:26:57.226 --> 01:27:03.870]  I'm not going to get into it, but the point is, his attack on me a few months ago was so big, it was like, here, I'll free all these people, but you can crucify Alex Jones.
[01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:04.971]  I was like, great, do it.
[01:27:04.971 --> 01:27:07.852]  And then I can also see that the governor's been taken off.
[01:27:07.852 --> 01:27:08.813]  And the bad guys know that.
[01:27:09.998 --> 01:27:15.761]  Um, you know, I've been systematically republishing videos that were banned and deleted in 2020 back on YouTube.
[01:27:15.761 --> 01:27:16.702]  Uh, so far, so good.
[01:27:16.702 --> 01:27:18.483]  I've probably put up a couple hundred videos.
[01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:24.406]  We'll see if there's a pushback, but I think they're seeing what's happening out there and they can't be as draconian as they used to be.
[01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:29.328]  We need to take this momentum and find a way, again, to find some decentralized social media.
[01:27:29.328 --> 01:27:33.651]  Do the kind of thing you're doing where you can get the information directly to the people, and that's what I've been working on.
[01:27:33.651 --> 01:27:35.632]  Well, that's, that'd be, but I can tell you what's happened on YouTube with you.
[01:27:36.292 --> 01:27:43.955]  When you were doing that as groundbreaking, when you were one of the first, with myself and David Icke and others, it was super dangerous because you were at the tip of the spear.
[01:27:43.955 --> 01:27:44.936]  Yeah.
[01:27:44.936 --> 01:27:51.739]  Now they've already lost that fight with the shots and not working and all that, so they're kind of like, oh, they're letting you put up the old stuff now because they already lost that fight, see?
[01:27:52.079 --> 01:27:52.399]  Yeah.
[01:27:52.399 --> 01:27:53.260]  No, it's definitely true.
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.682]  It's not as effective as it was back then in 2020.
[01:27:55.682 --> 01:27:58.905]  It's just interesting to see the tides go back and forth.
[01:27:58.905 --> 01:28:02.167]  I think they're very concerned about their own files being released at some point.
[01:28:02.167 --> 01:28:04.369]  And again, there's criminal action there.
[01:28:04.369 --> 01:28:05.970]  So it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
[01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:08.653]  Oh, it's totally criminal to collude with the government secretly.
[01:28:08.653 --> 01:28:10.154]  They've all lied to Congress saying they weren't.
[01:28:10.154 --> 01:28:11.335]  It's all confirmed they did it.
[01:28:11.335 --> 01:28:11.655]  Yeah.
[01:28:11.655 --> 01:28:14.157]  We know the dashboard documents even from Twitter that have come out.
[01:28:14.157 --> 01:28:19.181]  They were coordinating with all the other tech companies, not just the big other four or five, but dozens of them.
[01:28:19.181 --> 01:28:21.043]  Were you surprised at anything in those Twitter files?
[01:28:22.165 --> 01:28:24.046]  No, because we'd already gotten pieces of it everywhere.
[01:28:24.046 --> 01:28:25.627]  I already had.
[01:28:25.627 --> 01:28:26.488]  Mike Sternowitz is great.
[01:28:26.488 --> 01:28:31.050]  He put me in touch with Google Whistleblowers when I was first getting de-platformed four or five years ago.
[01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:34.412]  That was the documents and the dashboards of what they were doing.
[01:28:34.412 --> 01:28:34.973]  So we already knew.
[01:28:34.973 --> 01:28:36.413]  And it was all hooked into the other tech.
[01:28:36.413 --> 01:28:37.774]  They were all coordinating.
[01:28:37.774 --> 01:28:39.075]  So a lot of this had already come out.
[01:28:39.075 --> 01:28:41.116]  It's just that with the Twitter files, you can't deny it.
[01:28:41.116 --> 01:28:42.117]  It's like all in one big piece.
[01:28:42.637 --> 01:28:49.884]  And yet the Twitter files themselves have been suppressed by mainstream media, which means the average Joe in public still doesn't understand the ramifications of the Twitter files.
[01:28:49.884 --> 01:28:50.544]  Exactly.
[01:28:50.544 --> 01:28:50.905]  Amazing.
[01:28:50.905 --> 01:28:52.406]  Mr. Rose, stay right there.
[01:28:52.406 --> 01:28:53.267]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:53.267 --> 01:28:54.568]  Londonreal.tv.
[01:28:54.568 --> 01:28:54.969]  Check it out.
[01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:05.886]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:29:05.886 --> 01:29:08.548]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:29:08.548 --> 01:29:10.729]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:13.331]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:29:13.331 --> 01:29:16.554]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:29:16.554 --> 01:29:18.315]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:29:18.315 --> 01:29:24.940]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:27.723]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:29:28.703 --> 01:29:30.804]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:29:30.804 --> 01:29:35.448]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:29:35.448 --> 01:29:39.150]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:42.292]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[01:29:42.292 --> 01:29:44.854]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:29:44.854 --> 01:29:46.195]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:29:46.195 --> 01:29:51.979]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:51.979 --> 01:29:53.359]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:29:53.359 --> 01:29:54.680]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.623]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[01:29:59.544 --> 01:30:04.568]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:30:04.568 --> 01:30:06.730]  We made it even stronger.
[01:30:06.730 --> 01:30:10.474]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:30:10.474 --> 01:30:15.618]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:15.618 --> 01:30:23.445]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:30:23.445 --> 01:30:24.907]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:30:25.527 --> 01:30:38.616]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:30:38.616 --> 01:30:40.597]  It is the super fuel.
[01:30:40.597 --> 01:30:42.078]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:30:42.078 --> 01:30:42.938]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:43.899]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:30:43.899 --> 01:30:45.080]  They go good with this.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.101]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:30:47.822 --> 01:30:49.303]  This is the Boss.
[01:30:49.303 --> 01:30:50.043]  TurboForce.
[01:30:50.043 --> 01:30:51.064]  Back in stock.
[01:30:51.064 --> 01:30:52.065]  Discounted.
[01:30:52.065 --> 01:30:53.806]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:53.806 --> 01:30:54.686]  More power.
[01:30:54.686 --> 01:30:55.667]  More strength.
[01:30:55.667 --> 01:31:00.130]  More energy.
[01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:12.097]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[01:31:12.097 --> 01:31:16.340]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:17.460]  We're good to go.
[01:31:33.666 --> 01:31:35.187]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:31:35.187 --> 01:31:43.553]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sleep aid, and our nitric oxide, and our real red pill.
[01:31:43.553 --> 01:31:45.615]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[01:31:45.615 --> 01:31:46.515]  They keep us on air.
[01:31:46.515 --> 01:31:48.296]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:31:48.296 --> 01:31:49.597]  So get off the bench.
[01:31:49.597 --> 01:31:50.438]  Get in the game.
[01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:57.183]  Step to the plate and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:59.761 --> 01:32:07.966]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the Globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:32:07.966 --> 01:32:09.427]  That is a hellish future.
[01:32:09.427 --> 01:32:18.832]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarshore.com.
[01:32:18.832 --> 01:32:24.436]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:32:24.436 --> 01:32:26.397]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:32:26.997 --> 01:32:32.380]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:36.322]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:32:36.322 --> 01:32:42.205]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:32:42.205 --> 01:32:44.286]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[01:32:45.086 --> 01:32:45.826]  Or unsigned copies.
[01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:56.469]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:32:56.469 --> 01:32:57.529]  This is an Infowar.
[01:32:57.529 --> 01:33:00.430]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:05.032]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.032 --> 01:33:06.332]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.718 --> 01:33:18.387]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:18.387 --> 01:33:20.150]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:22.913 --> 01:33:25.015]  We will not be silenced.
[01:33:25.015 --> 01:33:27.398]  Ryan Rose of LondonReal.tv is here to deal with us.
[01:33:27.398 --> 01:33:28.499]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:28.499 --> 01:33:30.361]  And notice the theme!
[01:33:30.361 --> 01:33:37.428]  They tried to silence him, only made him bigger because he persevered and didn't give up and reached out to others to join him in a quest for human freedom.
[01:33:37.428 --> 01:33:39.570]  And you have had such a massive effect.
[01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:41.752]  Most of the listeners know who you are.
[01:33:41.752 --> 01:33:45.396]  But, I mean, so many times, critical big stories that really broke through.
[01:33:46.016 --> 01:33:50.899]  You and your team got it done, and that's because other fellow humans believed in it and joined with you at the work.
[01:33:50.899 --> 01:33:57.263]  So now you've got a documentary coming out, now that we're several years into the censorship and control, to tell your story.
[01:33:57.263 --> 01:33:59.064]  Will your documentary save the world?
[01:33:59.064 --> 01:34:00.244]  Will Alex's world save the world?
[01:34:00.244 --> 01:34:03.686]  Will my book, Great Reset and the War for the World?
[01:34:03.686 --> 01:34:07.228]  No, but all of us together contributing will save the world.
[01:34:07.228 --> 01:34:08.349]  And I used this example earlier.
[01:34:09.963 --> 01:34:16.404]  The CIA, the FBI, they're all weaponized, they're spying on us, they're censoring, they're in interfaces digitally.
[01:34:16.404 --> 01:34:22.446]  And yes, remember they wanted the Justice Department two and a half years ago when parents didn't like critical race theory or transgenderism and talked to their kids.
[01:34:22.446 --> 01:34:24.466]  They were just speaking up at city council.
[01:34:24.466 --> 01:34:27.007]  They said, we'll send the feds, call them terrorists.
[01:34:27.007 --> 01:34:32.228]  It turns out Biden two years ago sent letters to the teachers unions to say, call for us to come.
[01:34:32.768 --> 01:34:34.890]  They want to use the government to intimidate parents?
[01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:35.591]  Did that work?
[01:34:35.591 --> 01:34:39.394]  No, parents got even more aggressive and started speaking out non-violently.
[01:34:39.394 --> 01:34:42.057]  So, okay, use the CIA on Alex Jones.
[01:34:42.057 --> 01:34:43.398]  Use it on Tucker Carlson.
[01:34:43.398 --> 01:34:46.821]  Use MI6 or MI5 on London Real.
[01:34:46.821 --> 01:34:51.265]  Use people to lie about us and plant stories and say we're this and that and call us Nazis.
[01:34:51.265 --> 01:34:52.447]  Everybody gets your MO.
[01:34:52.447 --> 01:34:53.307]  It doesn't work.
[01:34:54.198 --> 01:35:02.619]  At the same time, I've got people in every age as you can imagine, and former as well, that are giving us the intel and fighting and are totally awake and pissed.
[01:35:02.619 --> 01:35:07.160]  So, we've passed the point where we have more people in the deep state than they have.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.860]  They just have the folks on the top.
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:12.861]  But as you said earlier, Brian, it's the next shoe to drop.
[01:35:12.861 --> 01:35:18.382]  The people that are going to Wikileak or whistleblow out of Google, out of Apple, out of Facebook.
[01:35:18.382 --> 01:35:21.283]  And that's why they're so concerned, but that's also what makes them so dangerous.
[01:35:21.283 --> 01:35:23.503]  So tell us about your new documentary and we'll play the trailer.
[01:35:23.863 --> 01:35:26.086]  So we were at the tip of the spear when this all happened.
[01:35:26.086 --> 01:35:31.452]  As you know, Alex, on April 6th of 2020, you were one of the first people to call me up and said, Brian, come on the show.
[01:35:31.452 --> 01:35:35.578]  And I remember you asked me, Alex, you said, Brian, what made you fight back?
[01:35:35.578 --> 01:35:36.859]  Like, what was that reaction?
[01:35:36.859 --> 01:35:40.464]  And it was just this visceral reaction inside of me, Alex, that just said, wait a second.
[01:35:40.464 --> 01:35:41.625]  There's so many more at that point.
[01:35:41.625 --> 01:35:42.306]  Now it's contagious.
[01:35:42.526 --> 01:35:47.310]  I know, and now revisionist history, everybody talks about how they were fighting for that back in April.
[01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:56.797]  Back in April, there was very few people that were bold enough to even come in the office, let alone broadcast, let alone broadcast messages that were contrary to the WHO and all that.
[01:35:56.797 --> 01:36:05.084]  Take us back to that time, because you're a nice guy, let me talk, I'll run over you, but let's not forget January, February, March, April.
[01:36:05.854 --> 01:36:09.355]  April, the peak point of almost everybody rolling over, going along with it.
[01:36:09.355 --> 01:36:13.676]  You know, the daily wires, almost all of them said, take your shots, keep the lockdown going.
[01:36:13.676 --> 01:36:16.117]  But you and I and others, we didn't go along with it.
[01:36:16.117 --> 01:36:16.477]  Yeah.
[01:36:16.477 --> 01:36:17.617]  I mean, the timeline was crazy.
[01:36:17.617 --> 01:36:19.478]  It was January.
[01:36:19.478 --> 01:36:21.258]  The virus is being reported.
[01:36:21.258 --> 01:36:23.579]  February, it was kind of coming into the UK.
[01:36:23.579 --> 01:36:25.359]  March, they were talking about lockdown.
[01:36:25.359 --> 01:36:29.020]  We put these messages out there and then I got banned across all platforms.
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:30.341]  We had to fight back.
[01:36:30.341 --> 01:36:32.321]  We were the only people that were fighting back.
[01:36:32.321 --> 01:36:34.982]  We were having in-person conversations and broadcasting them out.
[01:36:35.282 --> 01:36:36.343]  And they were going viral, Alex.
[01:36:36.343 --> 01:36:37.764]  They were going all around the world.
[01:36:37.764 --> 01:36:43.269]  And it was people like you that championed us and then said, Brian, you've got to ask for help and you've got to fight back.
[01:36:43.269 --> 01:36:44.790]  And that was a big moment for us.
[01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:51.615]  And we asked everyone around the world, the London Real Army, to help us, to help us build this brand new digital freedom platform.
[01:36:51.615 --> 01:36:57.180]  And then on May 3rd, we pulled off the largest live stream broadcast of a human conversation, me and David Icke.
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:00.142]  I mean, if you remember, Alex, there were no sporting events at the time.
[01:37:00.142 --> 01:37:01.363]  Everybody was locked inside.
[01:37:01.363 --> 01:37:02.544]  Everybody was scared.
[01:37:02.544 --> 01:37:05.126]  And we were putting out things that, guess what, Alex?
[01:37:05.126 --> 01:37:08.329]  In retrospect, 98% of what we were saying was true.
[01:37:08.329 --> 01:37:12.452]  But back then, lab leak theory, you were going to be put in a padded room, right?
[01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:13.553]  Questioning the vaccine.
[01:37:13.553 --> 01:37:15.014]  Deplatformed everywhere.
[01:37:15.014 --> 01:37:16.075]  Asking about masks.
[01:37:16.075 --> 01:37:17.716]  Asking about social distancing.
[01:37:17.716 --> 01:37:18.777]  Nobody was doing that.
[01:37:18.777 --> 01:37:20.238]  And again, I keep harping on this, guys.
[01:37:20.238 --> 01:37:20.699]  Just type in.
[01:37:20.699 --> 01:37:21.800]  Everybody's seen the headlines.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.421]  London Guardian.
[01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:24.142]  London Telegraph.
[01:37:25.423 --> 01:37:29.647]  The National Post out of Canada, the Washington Post.
[01:37:29.647 --> 01:37:29.948]  U.S.
[01:37:29.948 --> 01:37:31.329]  intelligence agencies, U.K.
[01:37:31.329 --> 01:37:32.791]  intelligence agencies, German E.U.
[01:37:32.791 --> 01:37:40.619]  intelligence agencies are helping use shy-ops to scare people to stay in lockdowns and take future shots and to censor disinformation.
[01:37:40.619 --> 01:37:42.801]  So again, we were up against intelligence agencies.
[01:37:43.502 --> 01:37:44.502]  That's illegal!
[01:37:44.502 --> 01:37:45.623]  Yeah, that's illegal.
[01:37:45.623 --> 01:37:48.064]  And now with the Twitter files, it's all become into perspective.
[01:37:48.064 --> 01:37:49.805]  But the thing that killed me is this, Alex.
[01:37:49.805 --> 01:37:55.447]  When they took away my right to broadcast, I stood up and said, wait a second, First Amendment, this is my right to free speech.
[01:37:55.447 --> 01:37:58.308]  And everyone stood up and said, no, no, no, it's a private company.
[01:37:58.308 --> 01:38:01.349]  You said yes to their policy, so you have to acquiesce to that.
[01:38:01.349 --> 01:38:07.692]  Later, I find out, Alex, that these same government officials that were supposed to protect my human rights went around and censored the company.
[01:38:08.152 --> 01:38:09.453]  So they have the best of both worlds.
[01:38:09.453 --> 01:38:14.698]  They denied it to my face and then they went ahead and made the company censor me.
[01:38:14.698 --> 01:38:16.359]  The public needs to know about what happened.
[01:38:16.359 --> 01:38:17.781]  I want to ask about YouTube.
[01:38:17.781 --> 01:38:18.982]  I want the Google files out.
[01:38:18.982 --> 01:38:20.323]  I want the Facebook files out.
[01:38:20.323 --> 01:38:31.293]  And again, this documentary film that we have has, I have recorded conversations with YouTube officials trying to censor me, telling me things that were just breaking laws and we're going to put it all out there in the documentary.
[01:38:31.293 --> 01:38:32.314]  Let's go ahead and roll the trailer.
[01:38:41.161 --> 01:38:45.823]  The past few weeks seem like a blur.
[01:38:45.823 --> 01:38:49.464]  Our homes became prisons.
[01:38:49.464 --> 01:38:55.187]  Mothers are afraid to touch their children.
[01:38:55.187 --> 01:39:01.289]  Debates are a danger to public health.
[01:39:01.289 --> 01:39:09.413]  And we're a few seconds away from streaming one of the most controversial conversations of the decade.
[01:39:09.413 --> 01:39:10.113]  Cameras are ready.
[01:39:12.056 --> 01:39:15.618]  Get ready.
[01:39:15.618 --> 01:39:21.343]  But I wonder... Is the world ready?
[01:39:21.343 --> 01:39:22.463]  This is London Real.
[01:39:22.463 --> 01:39:23.264]  I am Brian Rose.
[01:39:23.264 --> 01:39:25.746]  My guest today is David Icke.
[01:39:25.746 --> 01:39:28.608]  What happened after that broadcast, Brian?
[01:39:28.608 --> 01:39:30.809]  London Real had an interview with David Icke.
[01:39:30.809 --> 01:39:32.250]  He was removed from YouTube.
[01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:34.632]  If you take that guy off, you just make him bigger.
[01:39:35.326 --> 01:39:40.554]  Awaken to who you really are!
[01:39:40.554 --> 01:39:45.241]  I want to be with Brian Rose and David Icke in the universe.
[01:39:45.241 --> 01:39:49.306]  That is the future and that will never be defeated!
[01:39:49.306 --> 01:39:50.668]  What the hell just happened?
[01:39:54.915 --> 01:39:55.955]  We will not be silenced.
[01:39:55.955 --> 01:39:56.916]  Wow, when does this come out?
[01:39:56.916 --> 01:39:57.416]  Very impressive.
[01:39:57.416 --> 01:39:58.357]  It comes out in July.
[01:39:58.357 --> 01:40:03.159]  It's going to blow everyone's mind and remind them that we're still in this information war, Alex.
[01:40:03.159 --> 01:40:05.360]  Oh, I want to be next question.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:05.520]  Yeah.
[01:40:06.644 --> 01:40:07.464]  They're not going to give up.
[01:40:07.464 --> 01:40:09.925]  They admit new diseases they're going to release, new censorship.
[01:40:09.925 --> 01:40:10.725]  This was the beta test.
[01:40:10.725 --> 01:40:13.286]  So people need to like go, whoa, we kind of won this war.
[01:40:13.286 --> 01:40:14.046]  They killed a bunch of people.
[01:40:14.046 --> 01:40:14.886]  They took a bunch of our rights.
[01:40:14.886 --> 01:40:17.587]  A bunch of people committed suicide, mask on kids, all the problems.
[01:40:17.587 --> 01:40:19.648]  But we're like, oh, we're glad we're out of that.
[01:40:19.648 --> 01:40:22.829]  Because as successful people, we kind of brush ourselves off and aren't victims.
[01:40:22.829 --> 01:40:24.409]  We kind of get over the trauma.
[01:40:24.409 --> 01:40:25.109]  No, no, no.
[01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:26.029]  Don't get over the trauma.
[01:40:26.029 --> 01:40:27.650]  Remember it to stop the next wave.
[01:40:27.970 --> 01:40:30.892]  Yeah, well, David Icke calls it the totalitarian tiptoe.
[01:40:30.892 --> 01:40:35.835]  We've actually been now conditioned to where we'll go back into lockdown, you know, on a moment's notice.
[01:40:35.835 --> 01:40:37.396]  We'll go use a QR code.
[01:40:37.396 --> 01:40:41.779]  We've actually been trained, Alex, to go right back into this whenever it's deemed necessary.
[01:40:41.779 --> 01:40:43.561]  So we have to be even more vigilant than ever.
[01:40:43.561 --> 01:40:44.381]  And guess what?
[01:40:44.381 --> 01:40:49.445]  Their information powers, their powers to come after us are just getting better and better and better.
[01:40:49.445 --> 01:40:51.606]  So and with AI, there's lots of other issues.
[01:40:51.606 --> 01:40:52.847]  So we have to stay vigilant.
[01:40:52.847 --> 01:40:54.708]  Most people don't even know this story happened.
[01:40:54.708 --> 01:40:57.150]  We have to remind people that this is a constant threat.
[01:40:57.210 --> 01:41:00.554]  Yeah, they want us to forget how they tried to muzzle and did.
[01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:04.099]  Hundreds of thousands of medical professionals, thousands of doctors, members of Congress.
[01:41:04.099 --> 01:41:09.726]  Rand Paul, it was a year after you and I exposed it, but he, like a year and a half after, he was agreeing and they were censoring him!
[01:41:09.726 --> 01:41:11.148]  This is a U.S.
[01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:11.448]  Senator!
[01:41:12.014 --> 01:41:25.562]  I mean, at the time, on our digital freedom platform, after we had Ike, Alex, after we had you on the show, I had 50 other doctors, I had people from the Great Barrington Declaration, I had to put it there, they were all speaking the truth, all being censored, only now is some of that coming to the surface.
[01:41:25.562 --> 01:41:36.709]  And you're trying to save lives, and you're on your independent platform getting millions, not tens of millions, and it's so frustrating, like, you want to tell people, hey, vitamin C, vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine, you want to tell them, but you're not allowed.
[01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:38.431]  Yeah, and now we know why.
[01:41:38.431 --> 01:41:41.315]  Now we can see all the evidence of why that was being held back.
[01:41:41.315 --> 01:41:43.197]  We can see the doctors that were persecuted.
[01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:45.079]  We see the science that was being violated.
[01:41:45.079 --> 01:41:47.002]  I mean, I come from a science background, Alex.
[01:41:47.002 --> 01:41:49.805]  It's just hard to believe, and yet most people still don't really know it.
[01:41:49.805 --> 01:41:50.306]  I agree.
[01:41:50.306 --> 01:41:51.848]  Hey, is it too late to skip this break?
[01:41:56.567 --> 01:41:57.208]  Skip it.
[01:41:57.208 --> 01:41:58.269]  All right, keep going.
[01:41:58.269 --> 01:42:02.614]  Yeah, so we have to just make sure it goes front and center again, because again, it just goes back down under.
[01:42:02.614 --> 01:42:04.296]  Like you said, most people think it's over.
[01:42:04.296 --> 01:42:05.217]  It'll never happen again.
[01:42:05.217 --> 01:42:06.319]  That'll never happen again.
[01:42:06.319 --> 01:42:10.304]  It will happen again, and now we've been conditioned so it'll even happen easier next time.
[01:42:10.304 --> 01:42:13.608]  And they've said it will happen again, and they're building these camps all over the world.
[01:42:14.568 --> 01:42:16.468]  Yeah, there's a lot of scary things happening.
[01:42:16.468 --> 01:42:17.829]  Again, look to China.
[01:42:17.829 --> 01:42:19.189]  It's coming here.
[01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:22.430]  Look at what they're doing with the CBDCs, the monitoring, everything like that.
[01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:23.970]  It's slowly going to come here.
[01:42:23.970 --> 01:42:25.371]  People think it's not happening, but it is.
[01:42:25.371 --> 01:42:29.892]  We have to be really vigilant, Alex, and that's why independent media is crucial.
[01:42:29.892 --> 01:42:33.432]  It's crucial what you're doing, what we're doing, and what Tucker's doing.
[01:42:33.432 --> 01:42:34.053]  Next question.
[01:42:34.053 --> 01:42:37.273]  You're a former very successful banker and Wall Street guy.
[01:42:37.273 --> 01:42:39.514]  Looking at the world economic situation, where is it right now?
[01:42:40.171 --> 01:42:42.152]  Well, you know, it's pretty interesting to see what happened.
[01:42:42.152 --> 01:42:45.434]  Obviously, during lockdown, we saw the massive printing of fiat currencies.
[01:42:45.434 --> 01:42:48.556]  I'm here in Austin because I'm at the Blockchain Conference.
[01:42:48.556 --> 01:42:55.600]  So we're looking at alternative forms of money, alternative forms of communication that don't require these institutions like banks and governments.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.981]  What we're looking at is a pretty dire situation.
[01:42:57.981 --> 01:43:01.643]  And again, what we're trying to do is give the power back to the people.
[01:43:01.643 --> 01:43:04.865]  What I want is for people to have a relationship with money, because I think
[01:43:05.485 --> 01:43:07.567]  I had a guest on my show recently, Alex, named Dan Held.
[01:43:07.567 --> 01:43:08.568]  He's out of Texas as well.
[01:43:08.568 --> 01:43:12.351]  And he said, Brian, without financial freedom, we can't even have freedom of speech.
[01:43:12.351 --> 01:43:12.671]  You're right.
[01:43:12.671 --> 01:43:13.672]  That's the foundation.
[01:43:13.672 --> 01:43:14.753]  Yeah, it is.
[01:43:14.753 --> 01:43:15.133]  It really is.
[01:43:15.133 --> 01:43:24.982]  In fact, they say first, second, yeah, speech is number one, defense is number two, but they really should have almost had, you know, the first amendment should have been the second amendment and the second should have been the third.
[01:43:24.982 --> 01:43:28.665]  It should be financial independence and a currency they don't control.
[01:43:29.065 --> 01:43:30.166]  Yeah, and look what they're doing now.
[01:43:30.166 --> 01:43:31.768]  They're rolling out the CBDCs.
[01:43:31.768 --> 01:43:34.371]  The one in China with the yuan, it's dark.
[01:43:34.371 --> 01:43:34.991]  I've already heard.
[01:43:34.991 --> 01:43:37.614]  I think about 100-150 million people already have access to it.
[01:43:37.614 --> 01:43:38.375]  The U.S.
[01:43:38.375 --> 01:43:40.657]  is rolling out this FedNow program in July.
[01:43:40.657 --> 01:43:43.120]  People don't understand the ramifications of the CBDC.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.825]  Imagine them giving you money and be able to take it back to you at any point in time based on your spending habits.
[01:43:49.325 --> 01:43:51.266]  Where you spend it, and now it's on the blockchain.
[01:43:51.266 --> 01:43:53.067]  It can be suspended at any point in time.
[01:43:53.067 --> 01:43:54.987]  You want to talk about controlling the people?
[01:43:54.987 --> 01:44:03.170]  It'll make the information, the censorship on Web2 platforms, the masks, it'll make it look like child's play, Alex, when they can pull your money at a moment's notice.
[01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:05.611]  And yet I think people still don't know it's coming.
[01:44:05.611 --> 01:44:09.172]  So we've got to fight back against this and keep the dollar free.
[01:44:09.172 --> 01:44:09.592]  It's crucial.
[01:44:10.032 --> 01:44:10.432]  I agree.
[01:44:10.432 --> 01:44:11.593]  Here's the good news.
[01:44:11.593 --> 01:44:14.976]  Six months ago, a year ago, two years ago, we were talking about central bank digital currencies.
[01:44:14.976 --> 01:44:16.057]  Nobody knew what it was.
[01:44:16.057 --> 01:44:17.278]  Now they've got legislation.
[01:44:17.278 --> 01:44:20.780]  Senators are talking about it, House members, people around the world.
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:23.302]  There is an awakening curve, but it's not fast enough.
[01:44:23.302 --> 01:44:24.623]  Yeah, it's not fast enough.
[01:44:24.623 --> 01:44:28.326]  At least we now know because we play with these digital currencies like the Bitcoins and Ethereums.
[01:44:28.326 --> 01:44:33.850]  We know what it is, but they're rolling it out anyways, and they keep people busy with, look over here, look over here.
[01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:35.431]  I totally agree with you, Brian.
[01:44:56.127 --> 01:44:58.568]  I could ask a hundred questions, but what do you want to get into next?
[01:44:58.568 --> 01:45:02.569]  You know, again, we want to get this message out as far as information.
[01:45:02.569 --> 01:45:10.551]  We want to tell the story about what happened to us as far as the sunscreen, because it's continuing to happen, and it's going to come back in in another wave that I think is going to be even worse.
[01:45:10.551 --> 01:45:13.852]  So what I want to do now is just decentralize everything, Alex.
[01:45:13.852 --> 01:45:15.273]  I want to get it peer-to-peer.
[01:45:15.273 --> 01:45:18.374]  One thing I didn't mention is that big livestream we did on May 3rd.
[01:45:18.374 --> 01:45:21.935]  Two-thirds of the viewers of that came from peer-to-peer sharing.
[01:45:21.935 --> 01:45:24.016]  Nothing to do with the Big Tap platform.
[01:45:24.016 --> 01:45:24.556]  No social
[01:45:25.456 --> 01:45:30.218]  So what you're literally, we're building by using it, by us doing it, by them using it, we're building a new infrastructure.
[01:45:30.218 --> 01:45:35.460]  Yes, and that's crucial and it has to be money-based, it has to be community-based and information-based.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:42.582]  If we don't build this now and we've got a short window and check the AI coming, we don't really have much of a future and it's all happening very fast.
[01:45:42.822 --> 01:45:43.943]  Well, let me back up what you said.
[01:45:43.943 --> 01:45:46.125]  You said they're going to hit us with something even worse.
[01:45:46.125 --> 01:45:48.827]  The restrictat is an internet ID.
[01:45:48.827 --> 01:45:54.492]  If you use VPNs, they can put you in jail for 20 years if they want.
[01:45:54.492 --> 01:45:56.413]  It surveils everything in the name of countering Huawei.
[01:45:56.413 --> 01:45:57.454]  It has nothing to do with Huawei.
[01:45:57.454 --> 01:46:00.877]  It accesses all the new smart devices in your home.
[01:46:00.877 --> 01:46:02.558]  Let's the government take those over.
[01:46:02.558 --> 01:46:03.639]  It's so outrageous.
[01:46:03.639 --> 01:46:05.241]  I can't even believe it when I read the bill.
[01:46:05.241 --> 01:46:06.902]  They've got that and all these other systems.
[01:46:06.902 --> 01:46:10.225]  So, they're trying to deploy all this right now ahead of something big.
[01:46:10.868 --> 01:46:17.650]  Yeah, once they have a record of all of your information, all of your activity, then it's very easy to go after you in the future for anything that they choose.
[01:46:17.650 --> 01:46:19.130]  So this is happening again.
[01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:21.651]  You power it with AI, it gets even more dangerous.
[01:46:21.651 --> 01:46:24.532]  So we just all have to be super vigilant.
[01:46:24.532 --> 01:46:28.853]  And it's a narrative that maybe exhausts people after a while, but it's just as important to push forward.
[01:46:28.853 --> 01:46:30.914]  I want to ask viewers and listeners this.
[01:46:30.914 --> 01:46:34.755]  Do you think things will be better if we submit or worse if we
[01:46:36.135 --> 01:46:36.896]  Don't submit.
[01:46:36.896 --> 01:46:39.177]  Obviously, submission to this is death.
[01:46:39.177 --> 01:46:42.319]  But I want to say to the people that work for the system, I know you're all compartmentalized.
[01:46:42.319 --> 01:46:46.201]  Most of you aren't looking at this from a decompartmentalized model.
[01:46:46.201 --> 01:46:50.023]  That's why London Real, that's why Tucker Carlson, that's why InfoWars is so important.
[01:46:50.023 --> 01:46:58.168]  This former top Army psychological warfare operations officer said, Tucker Carlson is dangerous because he's decompartmentalizing and showing people the big picture.
[01:46:58.168 --> 01:46:58.749]  Because once
[01:46:59.429 --> 01:47:03.772]  The average person, and people that work in the system realize, wait, I'm building my own guillotine.
[01:47:03.772 --> 01:47:13.117]  If we get this awareness out early enough, we can all peacefully, non-compliant, sabotage it, like Mahatma Gandhi did, and build a new system.
[01:47:13.117 --> 01:47:14.938]  And all you have to do is say no, Alex.
[01:47:14.938 --> 01:47:21.042]  There's plenty of examples in human history where enough people just said no, we're not having it, and the government will back off.
[01:47:21.042 --> 01:47:23.884]  The people in power will back off because they're a few.
[01:47:23.884 --> 01:47:27.326]  They're not as powerful as we think they are, but they make it out as if they are.
[01:47:27.326 --> 01:47:28.827]  Why would even these elites build something
[01:47:29.827 --> 01:47:31.549]  Chivalry wasn't a wimpy thing.
[01:47:31.549 --> 01:47:36.235]  People said don't attack women and children because they didn't want their women and children attacked when they went out and attacked the other men.
[01:47:36.235 --> 01:47:40.962]  Why do they get rid of checks and balances that our civilization, thinking as elites, it protects them?
[01:47:40.962 --> 01:47:43.805]  If I was one of these elitists, I would want all the checks and balances.
[01:47:43.805 --> 01:47:45.548]  That protects them, not just us.
[01:47:45.888 --> 01:47:46.669]  You would think so.
[01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:47.390]  It's counterintuitive.
[01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:54.678]  But if you could empower everybody to be the best version of themselves, then yeah, we would have this incredible, productive, growing economy and growing world.
[01:47:54.678 --> 01:47:55.899]  But they're scared.
[01:47:55.899 --> 01:47:56.881]  This has worked in the past.
[01:47:56.881 --> 01:47:58.442]  It's a short-term fix.
[01:47:58.442 --> 01:47:59.544]  And it works.
[01:48:00.905 --> 01:48:01.185]  Thank you.
[01:48:19.141 --> 01:48:21.422]  Yeah, this is evidence they're not as smart as we think they are.
[01:48:21.422 --> 01:48:24.222]  They're playing checkers, you think they're playing chess, they're just not.
[01:48:24.222 --> 01:48:25.842]  And it's not more complicated than that.
[01:48:25.842 --> 01:48:35.925]  Like you said, these knee-jerk reactions, sometimes short-term views, but over time, systematically, without people pushing back, it's effective.
[01:48:35.925 --> 01:48:41.306]  But more than just them being... Because they are the grandchildren of the elites, and they are...
[01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:45.653]  Deccan and they are getting lazier and lazier, but they have a lot of confident people working for them.
[01:48:45.653 --> 01:48:48.655]  But Hitler knew when he attacked Russia he'd probably lose.
[01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:53.919]  He knew when he started a three-front war, North Africa, Russia, and with the West, that he'd lose.
[01:48:53.919 --> 01:48:59.683]  But if you read his writings towards the end, he said, my main mission is just kill all the Jews and wreak havoc.
[01:48:59.683 --> 01:49:02.445]  And the Germans deserve to die.
[01:49:02.445 --> 01:49:03.465]  He flooded the subways.
[01:49:04.206 --> 01:49:05.867]  He knew he was getting Jeremy annihilated.
[01:49:05.867 --> 01:49:07.369]  He just liked the ride.
[01:49:07.369 --> 01:49:10.351]  As we have to kind of understand, these psychos just like to do bad stuff.
[01:49:10.351 --> 01:49:12.974]  I think we've got some real psychos in charge here.
[01:49:12.974 --> 01:49:13.634]  Very possible.
[01:49:13.634 --> 01:49:16.317]  I mean, you look at some of the behavior and it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[01:49:16.317 --> 01:49:18.779]  And they've been in this power position for a long time.
[01:49:18.779 --> 01:49:24.343]  I think they're also using an old playbook, Alex, and it worked in the past and it was it was easier for it to work in the past.
[01:49:24.343 --> 01:49:28.487]  I mean, we didn't have people like you and me in the past, like all the media really was controlled.
[01:49:28.487 --> 01:49:29.288]  So, yeah.
[01:49:29.608 --> 01:49:32.931]  They aren't making, obviously, the most intelligent decisions, which is great.
[01:49:32.931 --> 01:49:35.073]  We should see that as like a crack in the armor and push forward.
[01:49:35.073 --> 01:49:41.339]  But it needs more people to be aware, more people to just put back and say, no, say I'm not giving you that information.
[01:49:41.339 --> 01:49:43.442]  No, I'm not going to allow that to happen with my schools.
[01:49:43.442 --> 01:49:45.744]  I'm not going to realize how much people think of themselves as little.
[01:49:46.124 --> 01:49:47.385]  So powerful.
[01:49:47.385 --> 01:49:47.886]  Exactly.
[01:49:47.886 --> 01:49:49.547]  All of us together, little decisions are big.
[01:49:49.547 --> 01:49:52.410]  Yeah, and it just has to, all you have to do is step up.
[01:49:52.410 --> 01:49:58.155]  And I know it's going to be slightly inconvenient, but you've just got to push back and say, no, we are not having this.
[01:49:58.155 --> 01:49:58.856]  We are not accepting.
[01:49:58.856 --> 01:50:00.898]  Because giving in is a trillion times more inconvenient.
[01:50:00.998 --> 01:50:01.699]  Yeah, it is.
[01:50:01.699 --> 01:50:05.142]  And again, you're going to have to answer to your children and to your grandchildren.
[01:50:05.142 --> 01:50:06.603]  And they're going to ask you questions.
[01:50:06.603 --> 01:50:08.344]  What did you do in the 20s?
[01:50:08.344 --> 01:50:10.246]  What did you do to facilitate the pushback?
[01:50:10.246 --> 01:50:11.747]  And you're going to have to give them an answer.
[01:50:11.747 --> 01:50:16.892]  And the future is ugly and dystopian unless we all stand up and be counted now.
[01:50:16.892 --> 01:50:17.692]  And we know future.
[01:50:18.513 --> 01:50:19.014]  We're good to go.
[01:50:34.773 --> 01:50:35.533]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:50:35.533 --> 01:50:40.616]  I mean, we had Robert Kennedy on the Digital Freedom Platform because he wasn't allowed on YouTube at the time.
[01:50:40.616 --> 01:50:43.317]  It's fascinating to see him now coming out and pushing back.
[01:50:43.317 --> 01:50:43.998]  Breaking out.
[01:50:43.998 --> 01:50:44.698]  Yeah, breaking out.
[01:50:44.698 --> 01:50:47.800]  And the massive censorship he's gone through, it's just incredible.
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.201]  It almost boggles my mind what they've done to him.
[01:50:50.201 --> 01:50:53.002]  He had the best-selling books in the country.
[01:50:53.002 --> 01:50:55.543]  Of course, it's not on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:50:55.543 --> 01:50:57.504]  Suppressed in all ways, shape, or form.
[01:50:57.504 --> 01:50:58.905]  And yet people don't even give him a chance.
[01:50:58.905 --> 01:51:02.027]  That's the thing, Alex, about people like you and Ike and Robert Kennedy.
[01:51:02.027 --> 01:51:04.268]  They don't even know you or what you talk about.
[01:51:04.628 --> 01:51:06.930]  All they know is that people say not to listen to you.
[01:51:06.930 --> 01:51:13.554]  If you actually listen to Kennedy for 10 minutes, you realize he's actually a very reasonable, very knowledgeable guy who really cares about the people.
[01:51:13.554 --> 01:51:14.555]  Who'd make a great president.
[01:51:14.555 --> 01:51:15.615]  Yeah, who'd make a great president.
[01:51:15.615 --> 01:51:16.496]  Same with you.
[01:51:16.496 --> 01:51:17.597]  Same with people like me.
[01:51:17.597 --> 01:51:23.180]  And yet the media, they con everyone into saying, oh no, don't listen to these people because they're bad.
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:23.761]  That's the thing.
[01:51:23.761 --> 01:51:32.707]  So people really have to take the time, walk a mile in a man's shoes, see what the total of what they're talking about, thinking about, and then make a judgment.
[01:51:32.707 --> 01:51:33.087]  Exactly.
[01:51:34.708 --> 01:51:38.409]  That I know you want to just watch movies at night and have fun and eat dinner and you worked all day.
[01:51:38.409 --> 01:51:40.730]  But folks, we're going to lose everything if we don't do this.
[01:51:40.730 --> 01:51:45.072]  And it's also an animating contest, so whoever they're saying don't listen to, you should listen to.
[01:51:45.072 --> 01:51:45.852]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:45.852 --> 01:51:50.254]  If someone is telling you not to listen to someone, you should want to go seek out and find out why.
[01:51:50.254 --> 01:51:51.534]  And yes, you said it really well, Alex.
[01:51:51.534 --> 01:51:52.955]  We have to be proactive here.
[01:51:53.315 --> 01:51:58.877]  I always say, what am I going to tell my children and grandchildren when they say, Papa, what did you do in the great crisis of 2020?
[01:51:58.877 --> 01:52:01.298]  Did you sit back and watch Netflix on binge?
[01:52:01.298 --> 01:52:03.379]  Did you go have a snack or did you fight?
[01:52:03.379 --> 01:52:05.920]  We all need to be proactive about our future.
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:07.220]  And notice they played to our laziness.
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:10.941]  Just stay home, drink beer, order, you know, order Uber Eats.
[01:52:10.941 --> 01:52:12.622]  And then meanwhile, the whole civilization collapses.
[01:52:12.782 --> 01:52:16.165]  Yeah, and it was completely coordinated and it was all dominated.
[01:52:16.165 --> 01:52:17.145]  They controlled our information.
[01:52:17.145 --> 01:52:18.386]  They controlled everything.
[01:52:18.386 --> 01:52:19.587]  And we fell right into it.
[01:52:19.587 --> 01:52:21.609]  So everyone has to take ownership.
[01:52:21.609 --> 01:52:25.092]  And again, it's ultimately all about love.
[01:52:25.092 --> 01:52:26.573]  Like, do you care about this world?
[01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:28.795]  Do you want the best for this world, for your children, for everybody?
[01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:48.308]  I totally agree with you, but from a sociopath view, and I'm not a sociopath, the opposite, I have deep empathy, but looking at a sociopath who's thinking only one step ahead and not ten steps ahead, this is so destructive, this anti-human world, a capitalist, free market, laissez-faire, libertarian, true liberal society is awesome, and that's what everybody wanted.
[01:52:48.308 --> 01:52:52.391]  Why join corporate fascists saying they're liberals that are destroying it?
[01:52:54.171 --> 01:52:57.673]  99.99% of people are not going to do well in this new world order.
[01:52:57.673 --> 01:53:00.274]  So even the sociopaths, why would you go along with this?
[01:53:00.274 --> 01:53:10.118]  Yeah, I know it's mind-boggling, but they're thinking short-term, and like I think Alex, they're running an old playbook on repeat that's worked for them in the past, but this is a new system now.
[01:53:10.118 --> 01:53:14.280]  We have new ways of information, new ways of compensating each other directly.
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:16.061]  It's going to break down, but people should see this.
[01:53:16.061 --> 01:53:17.382]  This is a crack in the armor.
[01:53:17.382 --> 01:53:19.543]  This could be one of our last chances, Alex.
[01:53:19.543 --> 01:53:22.884]  That's why we have to stay vigilant, because it's only going to get more advanced as we
[01:53:23.104 --> 01:53:33.055]  I totally agree, and as dark as things seem, I can sense historically and also feel, which is really your subconscious more powerful than your conscious, that we could really have a golden era if we play our cards right.
[01:53:33.055 --> 01:53:33.996]  It could be incredible.
[01:53:33.996 --> 01:53:41.644]  It could be incredibly golden, or three or four years from now it could be much darker than it was in 20 or 21 with things that we can't even comprehend.
[01:53:41.644 --> 01:53:42.545]  That's the inflection point!
[01:53:42.645 --> 01:53:44.686]  Yeah, it's happening right now, Alex.
[01:53:44.686 --> 01:53:45.507]  It's important.
[01:53:45.507 --> 01:53:47.448]  Which is why, you know, what you're doing is important.
[01:53:47.448 --> 01:53:48.589]  That's why we're putting this movie out now.
[01:53:48.589 --> 01:53:50.690]  Just to remind people of what happened.
[01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:53.052]  It's only going to get more advanced in the future.
[01:53:53.052 --> 01:53:54.092]  Well, I'm glad you came on.
[01:53:54.092 --> 01:53:55.253]  I'm glad you came to Austin.
[01:53:55.253 --> 01:53:59.416]  Of course, we'll be on anytime you want via Skype, Zoom, or when you're here in person.
[01:53:59.416 --> 01:54:00.717]  Tell us more about the movie.
[01:54:00.717 --> 01:54:02.858]  Where do we find it and bookmark it and promote it?
[01:54:02.858 --> 01:54:03.339]  Londonreal.tv?
[01:54:03.339 --> 01:54:04.479]  Is there a URL for the movie?
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:07.881]  Yeah, so it's londonreal.tv forward slash movie.
[01:54:07.881 --> 01:54:11.242]  We are going to premiere it in London on July 28th.
[01:54:11.242 --> 01:54:12.003]  We have a big event.
[01:54:12.003 --> 01:54:14.504]  Then we're going to premiere it around the world in different cities.
[01:54:14.504 --> 01:54:17.925]  And we'll also have an online premiere afterwards for anyone who wants to support it.
[01:54:17.925 --> 01:54:20.146]  We're also going to be digitally distributing this.
[01:54:20.146 --> 01:54:25.408]  I'm going to bake it into the blockchain to where it can never be censored ever, because I don't trust it, Alex.
[01:54:25.408 --> 01:54:28.650]  I do not trust it staying up there forever.
[01:54:28.650 --> 01:54:30.871]  I want to make sure people can always watch this.
[01:54:30.871 --> 01:54:34.012]  Brian, you asked me, because we only talked like 30 seconds before we went live today,
[01:54:35.416 --> 01:54:36.017]  How am I doing?
[01:54:50.572 --> 01:54:52.092]  Once you do it, it's exciting.
[01:54:52.092 --> 01:54:54.933]  So it's not like it's some horrible grind we're getting into.
[01:54:54.933 --> 01:54:58.354]  We're designed to promote free will and justice and freedom.
[01:54:58.354 --> 01:55:04.656]  And it's been good guys and good girls, good ladies, that haven't been engaged, kind of leaving it to the establishment that have allowed this.
[01:55:04.656 --> 01:55:09.917]  I think the rediscovery of this animating contest that Thomas Jefferson talked about is exploding right now.
[01:55:09.917 --> 01:55:14.079]  And once people, as you said, figure it out, it's addictive to do the right thing.
[01:55:14.079 --> 01:55:14.879]  It's in our cells.
[01:55:15.399 --> 01:55:19.021]  Yeah, and I love being part of the team that's on the right side of history.
[01:55:19.021 --> 01:55:26.045]  When I did that broadcast and you reached out, Alex, in addition to celebrities from all over the world and people and tons of influences, said, Brian, we're with you 100%.
[01:55:26.045 --> 01:55:29.527]  I'm telling you, Alex, people want to be in this fight.
[01:55:29.527 --> 01:55:33.329]  It's what we're here for as humans to protect what we value more than anything.
[01:55:33.329 --> 01:55:35.070]  And you are a huge part of that, Alex.
[01:55:35.070 --> 01:55:35.970]  I just want to say thank you.
[01:55:35.970 --> 01:55:42.154]  Well, here's a part of the Fight Club microcosm back three years ago when that was happening.
[01:55:43.547 --> 01:55:43.907]  I don't know.
[01:56:00.959 --> 01:56:03.920]  You know, the next day at a friend's house and they had it on.
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:04.820]  I think I told you about this.
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:05.420]  Yeah.
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:09.341]  And then I was talking to Joe Rogan on the phone and he said, have you seen this?
[01:56:09.341 --> 01:56:12.602]  It was like, you love to see that zeitgeist happening.
[01:56:12.602 --> 01:56:12.882]  Yeah.
[01:56:12.882 --> 01:56:14.142]  That's when you know you're over the target.
[01:56:14.142 --> 01:56:14.982]  Yeah, that's when you know.
[01:56:14.982 --> 01:56:17.863]  And people should sense out for those things and sense out like minded people.
[01:56:17.863 --> 01:56:21.023]  And if this message is resonating with you at all, come join us.
[01:56:21.023 --> 01:56:24.824]  We need you out there spreading this information, talking about these important issues.
[01:56:24.824 --> 01:56:26.204]  It's crucial and it's not hard.
[01:56:26.204 --> 01:56:28.405]  All we have to do is push back and say no.
[01:56:29.491 --> 01:56:30.573]  One minute left.
[01:56:30.573 --> 01:56:31.876]  Why are you living in Airstrip 1?
[01:56:31.876 --> 01:56:32.537]  Why'd you move to London?
[01:56:33.376 --> 01:56:36.799]  You know, I moved there 20 years ago, and it's been a beautiful thing.
[01:56:36.799 --> 01:56:38.620]  I feel like I'm an outpost out there.
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:50.389]  Speaking the truth, Alex, you know, I'm an American in London who's now a Brit, and I was in the right place at the right time to really put these messages out there, and I feel like I'm kind of an outpost for all the great work you're doing here in America and a lot of other people.
[01:56:50.389 --> 01:56:51.950]  So, for me, that's home.
[01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:52.991]  I am London Real.
[01:56:52.991 --> 01:56:57.294]  London Real is me, and we're just going to keep pushing these messages out there.
[01:56:57.294 --> 01:57:00.076]  Where should they go to share the trailer?
[01:57:00.076 --> 01:57:01.057]  Because I want to share that trailer.
[01:57:01.297 --> 01:57:01.958]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:57:01.958 --> 01:57:04.341]  We're going to have it up at londonreal.tv forward slash movie.
[01:57:04.341 --> 01:57:06.765]  I'm sure you're going to probably put it on band as well.
[01:57:06.765 --> 01:57:07.005]  Great.
[01:57:07.005 --> 01:57:08.347]  Guys, grab it and put it on band right now.
[01:57:08.347 --> 01:57:09.889]  Put it on the front page of Metaforce.
[01:57:09.889 --> 01:57:10.430]  Beautiful, man.
[01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:11.531]  Brother, love you.
[01:57:11.531 --> 01:57:12.332]  Appreciate you too, sir.
[01:57:12.332 --> 01:57:14.255]  Thank you for coming on and it's so exciting.
[01:57:14.255 --> 01:57:16.999]  You're taking us over the top, all of us together, brother.
[01:57:17.219 --> 01:57:17.879]  Let's do it, man.
[01:57:17.879 --> 01:57:18.460]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:19.300]  I appreciate you very much.
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:20.301]  I appreciate you.
[01:57:20.301 --> 01:57:22.342]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back.
[01:57:22.342 --> 01:57:24.903]  We have Luke Rutkowski joining us.
[01:57:24.903 --> 01:57:25.903]  Talk about a smart guy.
[01:57:25.903 --> 01:57:26.804]  I've known this guy 18 years.
[01:57:26.804 --> 01:57:28.625]  He just gets smarter and smarter.
[01:57:28.625 --> 01:57:30.846]  We were on Tim Pool's podcast a few weeks ago, went viral.
[01:57:30.846 --> 01:57:32.547]  He just knocks it out of the park.
[01:57:32.547 --> 01:57:35.188]  Luke Rutkowski, Rutkowski, Rutkowski.
[01:57:35.188 --> 01:57:36.048]  There's different ways of saying it.
[01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:39.970]  I'm going to ask him how he really says it, because I have, like, Russians tell me this, Polish people tell me this.
[01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:41.091]  I've known him for 18 years.
[01:57:41.091 --> 01:57:42.532]  It's Luke Rutkowski.
[01:57:42.532 --> 01:57:44.973]  But we're going to get the right way to pronounce his name, too, coming up.
[01:57:49.286 --> 01:57:55.289]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:57:55.289 --> 01:57:57.951]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:57:57.951 --> 01:58:00.112]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:58:00.112 --> 01:58:02.714]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:58:02.714 --> 01:58:05.935]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:58:05.935 --> 01:58:07.696]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:58:07.696 --> 01:58:14.320]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.122]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:58:18.089 --> 01:58:20.190]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:58:20.190 --> 01:58:24.834]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:58:24.834 --> 01:58:28.556]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:58:28.556 --> 01:58:31.678]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[01:58:31.678 --> 01:58:34.240]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:35.601]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:58:35.601 --> 01:58:38.563]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[01:58:38.563 --> 01:58:41.365]  We'll get a great products at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:41.365 --> 01:58:42.745]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:58:42.745 --> 01:58:44.066]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:58:44.066 --> 01:58:48.029]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:55.675]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:58:55.675 --> 01:58:57.617]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:58:57.617 --> 01:58:59.118]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:58:59.118 --> 01:59:01.920]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.921]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:59:04.722 --> 01:59:06.683]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:59:06.683 --> 01:59:09.124]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:59:09.124 --> 01:59:11.265]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:59:11.265 --> 01:59:16.648]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[01:59:16.648 --> 01:59:17.848]  Jail background.
[01:59:17.848 --> 01:59:18.909]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:59:18.909 --> 01:59:23.031]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:59:23.031 --> 01:59:24.631]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:59:24.631 --> 01:59:25.652]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:59:25.652 --> 01:59:28.213]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:59:28.213 --> 01:59:28.973]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:59:28.973 --> 01:59:29.854]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:59:30.554 --> 01:59:35.276]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt, great way to fund the operation.
[01:59:35.276 --> 01:59:50.641]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free AAA-253-3139.
[01:59:50.641 --> 01:59:56.543]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.972 --> 02:00:12.675]  Behind the scenes of the O'Biden crime empire, things can't be as smooth as they appear.
[02:00:12.675 --> 02:00:19.879]  What with the World War brewing on two fronts, and a bid for the presidency when 70% of the country says no.
[02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:28.683]  In fact, the departure of domestic policy advisor, Obama puppeteer, Susan Rice, reeks of a shift in Democratic support of Joe Biden.
[02:00:28.683 --> 02:00:32.425]  On top of it all, what had been on the back burner is now boiling over.
[02:00:32.705 --> 02:00:41.788]  As now even Mockingbird Media is reporting on the massive sex trafficking and child labor violations surrounding the Mayorkas border time bomb.
[02:00:41.788 --> 02:00:43.188]  This is from the New York Times.
[02:00:43.188 --> 02:00:47.870]  Thousands of children have ended up in punishing jobs across the country.
[02:00:48.490 --> 02:00:56.514]  Since the Fair Labor Standard Act of 1938, children under the age of 16 have been restricted from working under the conditions that Mayorkas is exponentially creating.
[02:00:56.514 --> 02:00:57.554]  You are failing
[02:01:17.763 --> 02:01:18.643]  Miserably.
[02:01:18.643 --> 02:01:22.444]  4 to 5 million people.
[02:01:22.444 --> 02:01:24.365]  1.4 million unknown gotaways.
[02:01:24.365 --> 02:01:28.466]  We have no idea who those people are, what kind of security they risk.
[02:01:28.466 --> 02:01:37.148]  You're not giving me any stats whatsoever in terms of the number of people that are human trafficked, how many young girls are sex trafficked.
[02:01:37.148 --> 02:01:37.868]  You don't have a clue.
[02:01:37.868 --> 02:01:42.810]  You wouldn't even answer how many dead bodies, which is very well documented, at the border.
[02:01:43.735 --> 02:01:44.675]  Do you not care?
[02:01:44.675 --> 02:01:53.238]  Do you not have just an ounce of human compassion for what your open border policy, the type of human depredations it is causing?
[02:01:53.238 --> 02:01:56.579]  You just sit there looking with a blank look on your face.
[02:01:56.579 --> 02:01:58.080]  So how bad is it?
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:08.303]  And I have seen the evidence of kids being reused to create a family unit.
[02:02:08.303 --> 02:02:09.463]  Same kid.
[02:02:09.463 --> 02:02:10.944]  Same kid over and over again.
[02:02:10.944 --> 02:02:11.404]  Rented kid.
[02:02:12.498 --> 02:02:13.759]  Not humane.
[02:02:13.759 --> 02:02:17.361]  It's not 90% going to parents anymore.
[02:02:17.361 --> 02:02:23.224]  It's a third or less going to parents in today's statistics and numbers.
[02:02:23.224 --> 02:02:23.504]  Now, Ms.
[02:02:23.504 --> 02:02:25.746]  Rodas, you've said that the U.S.
[02:02:25.746 --> 02:02:32.169]  government is the middleman in a multi-billion dollar migrant child trafficking operation.
[02:02:32.169 --> 02:02:34.591]  What did you mean when you used the term middleman?
[02:02:34.591 --> 02:02:40.314]  So, the United States government is receiving the children from the smugglers
[02:02:41.849 --> 02:02:42.450]  At the border.
[02:02:59.614 --> 02:03:04.156]  Transport those children to the end user.
[02:03:04.156 --> 02:03:12.679]  I was shocked and I am stunned that there is no one with law enforcement experience overseeing where children are going.
[02:03:12.679 --> 02:03:26.765]  You have people applying for children who we know are members of transnational criminal organizations, yet there's no one with any data analytics background or anything like that overseeing this operation.
[02:03:26.765 --> 02:03:28.946]  When one individual can sponsor
[02:03:29.846 --> 02:03:38.432]  20, or 30, or 40 people, and no one's asking a question about it, there's something seriously wrong and flawed with that program.
[02:03:38.432 --> 02:03:51.040]  ORR releases him, they send him to Florida, he's over there hanging out with a fella, his sponsor, not a father, not a mother, just a sponsor, and what does he do a few short months later?
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:52.601]  He kills him.
[02:03:52.601 --> 02:03:54.262]  He kills him.
[02:03:54.262 --> 02:03:57.424]  Now, I don't know what the protocol is down there, but when I look at this guy,
[02:03:58.686 --> 02:04:02.407]  He's got more chin whiskers than more 40-year-olds have.
[02:04:02.407 --> 02:04:03.967]  Look at that guy.
[02:04:03.967 --> 02:04:08.448]  Now how does a guy like that get into this country as a minor?
[02:04:08.448 --> 02:04:11.369]  You said these kids are being recruited in their home country.
[02:04:11.369 --> 02:04:12.689]  What do you mean by that?
[02:04:12.689 --> 02:04:17.730]  There's an example of a sponsor who currently is in Austin, Texas at this moment.
[02:04:17.730 --> 02:04:27.993]  He attempted to sponsor four children, one from the Pomona Fairplex emergency intake site and three from the Pecos emergency intake site, promising work.
[02:04:28.413 --> 02:04:34.857]  To these children who are making $2.50 a day on the coffee farm he owns in Guatemala.
[02:04:34.857 --> 02:04:36.598]  So he lured them here.
[02:04:36.598 --> 02:04:43.883]  The Department of Homeland Security has transnational criminal organizations on the top watch list.
[02:04:43.883 --> 02:04:47.746]  Some of who got their fingerprints here in Washington, D.C.
[02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:50.808]  and neighboring areas are sponsoring the children.
[02:04:50.808 --> 02:04:52.089]  It's indisputable.
[02:04:52.089 --> 02:04:56.232]  So the money goes to the trafficker who ultimately brings them here.
[02:04:56.232 --> 02:04:58.093]  The New York Times actually showed.
[02:04:58.953 --> 02:05:03.977]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:05:03.977 --> 02:05:06.158]  We made it even stronger.
[02:05:06.158 --> 02:05:09.900]  The strongest long-term energy you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:16.104]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:16.104 --> 02:05:23.209]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:24.330]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:05:24.970 --> 02:05:38.037]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:05:38.037 --> 02:05:40.018]  It is the super fuel.
[02:05:40.018 --> 02:05:41.498]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:05:41.498 --> 02:05:42.359]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:05:42.359 --> 02:05:43.319]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:05:43.319 --> 02:05:44.500]  They go good with this.
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:46.521]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:05:47.242 --> 02:05:48.723]  This is The Boss.
[02:05:48.723 --> 02:05:49.463]  TurboForce.
[02:05:49.463 --> 02:05:50.504]  Back in stock.
[02:05:50.504 --> 02:05:51.505]  Discounted.
[02:05:51.505 --> 02:05:53.206]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:53.206 --> 02:05:54.086]  More power.
[02:05:54.086 --> 02:05:55.087]  More strength.
[02:05:55.087 --> 02:05:59.529]  More energy.
[02:05:59.529 --> 02:06:01.631]  Big Brother.
[02:06:01.631 --> 02:06:02.611]  Mainstream Media.
[02:06:02.611 --> 02:06:03.432]  Government Cover-Ups.
[02:06:13.118 --> 02:06:15.020]  You want answers?
[02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:16.941]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:16.941 --> 02:06:24.727]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.727 --> 02:06:30.171]  We are now into our number three on this live April 27th, Thursday transmission.
[02:06:30.171 --> 02:06:33.614]  My old friend on him over 18 years, Luke Rudowsky, joins us now.
[02:06:33.614 --> 02:06:38.878]  The founder of WeAreChanged, WeAreChanged.com, and of course, a popular podcast from where he was here a few weeks ago.
[02:06:39.912 --> 02:06:42.294]  With some big panels that went viral.
[02:06:42.294 --> 02:06:51.219]  And I like the fact that he raised on the panel, not just the congressional hearings and the spying going on and the surveillance and the censorship, but the giant human trafficking.
[02:06:51.219 --> 02:06:53.001]  And that dam is breaking.
[02:06:53.001 --> 02:06:56.183]  Congressional hearings, 20 plus thousand pedophiles released.
[02:06:56.963 --> 02:07:03.406]  Hundreds of thousands of children are smuggled through every few months, being given to pedophiles in many cases, human smugglers.
[02:07:03.406 --> 02:07:04.827]  It's all coming down.
[02:07:04.827 --> 02:07:09.389]  So, I haven't talked to Luke since last week when I went on the show, and there's so much to cover.
[02:07:09.389 --> 02:07:17.633]  I want to hit Tucker Carlson first, the Ukraine situation, the economy, the central bank digital currencies, the human trafficking.
[02:07:17.633 --> 02:07:19.014]  Luke Radowsky, great to have you on.
[02:07:19.014 --> 02:07:20.735]  What do you want to plunge into first?
[02:07:21.943 --> 02:07:23.804]  Well, thank you so much for having me on.
[02:07:23.804 --> 02:07:33.771]  There's a lot of different things going on that I think are extremely important to talk about, since so many of these topics are just ignored, not talked about, shunned over.
[02:07:33.771 --> 02:07:41.637]  And I think the topic that you brought up recently, especially with the child traffickers out there, is important, especially with what happened with Tucker Carlson.
[02:07:41.637 --> 02:07:48.882]  A lot of people don't know this, but just a few days ago, when he was still on Fox News, he directly was talking about his own investigation
[02:07:49.142 --> 02:08:03.886]  Reaching out to the DOJ specifically asking them about their ongoing Epstein investigation Which the DOJ was supposed to respond to him to then a couple days later Tucker Carlson is of course taken off air and that investigation I'm still waiting.
[02:08:03.886 --> 02:08:12.449]  There's an ongoing investigation to what happened to Epstein Investigated by the DOJ that investigation we have heard nothing about and the only person
[02:08:12.469 --> 02:08:21.856]  The only person on national television, the only person in our media sphere that has ever officially reached out to the DOJ about this has been canned, has been taken off air.
[02:08:21.856 --> 02:08:41.152]  So I think, you know, a lot of people need to correlate those two stories because I think that has a lot more to do with it, especially when it comes to Big Pharma, especially when it comes to the military-industrial complex, especially when it comes to the larger intelligentsia state that is absolutely allergic to any accountability, to any criticism, and I think more than ever we need to be speaking about these issues more
[02:08:42.253 --> 02:08:49.922]  I totally agree, and I had Roger Stone on yesterday, who's good friends with Tucker as I am and many others, but he said,
[02:08:52.096 --> 02:08:54.778]  Was banned for what they were fearing he was about to say.
[02:08:54.778 --> 02:08:58.482]  It was everything he'd said before, the fact that they couldn't control him.
[02:08:58.482 --> 02:09:00.023]  That's why they did it.
[02:09:00.023 --> 02:09:03.186]  Tucker was let go because they realized he was being too effective.
[02:09:03.186 --> 02:09:06.189]  They thought, so what if we have a popular Fox show talking about the New World Order?
[02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:07.029]  That'll never change things.
[02:09:07.029 --> 02:09:16.818]  But because they're losing, they're doing desperate things, which now, I mean, he had more views on that video he put out last night than all the cable networks this week will have combined.
[02:09:16.818 --> 02:09:18.560]  That has really got to freak the system out, Luke.
[02:09:19.508 --> 02:09:22.510]  Yeah, the Fox News ratings, they're crashing.
[02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:33.637]  I mean, there's a poll right now that I just released right now showing that the numbers that they lost nearly 50% of total viewers and nearly 70% of viewers in the key demo last Tuesday alone.
[02:09:33.637 --> 02:09:37.980]  And there's no going back from this because why else would people be watching cable news?
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:42.603]  The only reason was, hey, there's there's this one guy actually willing to kind of challenge ideas.
[02:09:42.603 --> 02:09:46.446]  There's this one guy who's actually willing to even go as far as to criticize Donald Trump.
[02:09:46.446 --> 02:09:49.288]  There's a one guy willing to actually do his job as a journalist
[02:09:49.628 --> 02:09:51.809]  And that person, of course, was taken down.
[02:09:51.809 --> 02:09:54.150]  And this is not something that is new.
[02:09:54.150 --> 02:09:55.850]  This has been happening for a very long time.
[02:10:06.525 --> 02:10:07.765]  Yeah, Lou Dobbs is one of them.
[02:10:07.765 --> 02:10:09.566]  Phil Donahue is another individual.
[02:10:09.566 --> 02:10:10.887]  So is Jesse Ventura.
[02:10:10.887 --> 02:10:12.707]  He was put in golden handcuffs.
[02:10:12.707 --> 02:10:15.728]  James O'Keefe was taken down just a few weeks ago himself.
[02:10:15.728 --> 02:10:35.815]  So there's a long history of very powerful institutions, very powerful individuals, and Tucker keeps calling them hysterical and aggressive people in charge, and I absolutely agree with him on that assessment, that take down anyone that largely is anti-war, that stands in the way of the war machine, that stands in the way of the propaganda, because they know how effective
[02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:37.636]  Speaking the truth is.
[02:10:37.636 --> 02:10:54.325]  I wouldn't be doing this for over 20 plus years if I didn't believe in the powerful message of truth, of being able to speak truth, the power of being able to confront individuals, of being able to share information with individuals that they can then later take into their own lives and make better decisions for themselves.
[02:10:54.325 --> 02:11:02.230]  Well, Luke, what do you think Rupert Murdoch and the New World Order are thinking right now when this Tucker video from last night shot from his house, you know, hundreds of millions of views?
[02:11:02.230 --> 02:11:04.171]  I mean, it's got to scare the hell out of them.
[02:11:05.077 --> 02:11:05.577]  Exactly.
[02:11:05.577 --> 02:11:09.978]  And I think it is, and I think this is why kind of Tucker highlighted, hey, see you soon.
[02:11:09.978 --> 02:11:11.418]  What does he mean by that?
[02:11:11.418 --> 02:11:15.359]  Allegedly, according to the sources, people don't even know why Tucker was kind of taken down.
[02:11:15.359 --> 02:11:19.880]  Tucker allegedly doesn't even know why Tucker was taken down from all the sources that we're kind of reading online.
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:21.620]  Who really knows what's happening behind the scenes?
[02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:27.622]  But the fact that we still do not have an official explanation, the fact that we're still kind of guessing here what really happened here.
[02:11:27.622 --> 02:11:28.782]  Well, it's because they have nothing.
[02:11:28.782 --> 02:11:29.782]  It's because of his message.
[02:11:29.782 --> 02:11:31.142]  He was taken out because of the message.
[02:11:31.142 --> 02:11:33.583]  Even this woman producer suing him, he never met her.
[02:11:34.508 --> 02:11:52.914]  Yeah, they never met in real life, and she's out there on all the MSNBC shows, she's out there hysterically talking about all these microaggressions and all these other things that, again, actually play no reality in everyday American lives, where they're like, this doesn't really matter, who really cares about this?
[02:11:52.914 --> 02:11:58.115]  A lot of people are saying it's because of that lawsuit, a lot of people are saying it's because of the Dominion lawsuit, this doesn't add up at all.
[02:11:58.115 --> 02:12:01.937]  No, it's because he was anti-globalist, anti-war, and coming out against the poison shots.
[02:12:01.937 --> 02:12:02.597]  We know what happened.
[02:12:03.317 --> 02:12:09.622]  Yeah, no, I mean, I can tell you, Tucker's been kicking the tires and knowing this is probably coming, so he'll be back very, very soon.
[02:12:09.622 --> 02:12:10.603]  He's already back.
[02:12:10.603 --> 02:12:14.506]  I mean, one two-minute, 15-second clip, hundreds of millions of views.
[02:12:14.506 --> 02:12:14.746]  Wow.
[02:12:15.942 --> 02:12:29.333]  Yes, there's also talks about him allegedly being under an 18-month contract, and Fox News allegedly giving him golden handcuffs, just like they did in Jesse Ventura when he came out against the Iraq War, and he wouldn't cow down to the military-industrial complex.
[02:12:29.333 --> 02:12:32.876]  There's a possibility that they could do that, but we'll see how this plays out.
[02:12:32.876 --> 02:12:40.882]  But if they get the silence, Tucker Carlson, for the next 18 months, for the next presidential election cycle, holy cow, will that have a huge effect on the American people.
[02:12:40.882 --> 02:12:42.884]  You're right, the question is, is there golden handcuffs?
[02:12:42.884 --> 02:12:44.245]  Because I don't know what's in the contract.
[02:12:45.151 --> 02:12:59.010]  Yeah, so what I'm seeing and what I'm reading online, allegedly he's getting paid, you know, I think $10.5 million a month and that he still has an ongoing contract that is going to keep him there at Fox News for another 18 months.
[02:13:00.231 --> 02:13:09.959]  So, allegedly, he's been kicked out of his emails, he's been told not to do his show, his producer was also kind of kicked out of all the responsibilities that they had here.
[02:13:09.959 --> 02:13:11.860]  That's what we're hearing so far.
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:26.072]  And if this is an attempt for Fox News to say, hey, we're going to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, but hey, we're going to make sure that we comply with Big Pharma, that we comply with the military industrial complex, because Fox News is also under a lot of pressure.
[02:13:26.072 --> 02:13:29.194]  Remember what Schumer said, he said, we'll take out Fox.
[02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:32.392]  If they don't do what we want a month ago.
[02:13:32.392 --> 02:13:33.233]  Exactly.
[02:13:33.233 --> 02:13:48.400]  And when you look at all these lawsuits piling up, especially with the federal government, especially with AOC coming on national television and saying that Tucker Carlson is a threat, he needs to be censored, needs to be taken down by government action, all of this kind of lines up.
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:51.361]  And one day later, one day later, he's off the air.
[02:13:52.509 --> 02:13:53.909]  Exactly, and it makes sense.
[02:13:53.909 --> 02:14:05.711]  And also, at that same time, it wasn't just AOC, it was also Ray Epps that came out on national television and also came out against Tucker Carlson, specifically saying that he also is inciting violence, that he's dangerous.
[02:14:05.711 --> 02:14:12.353]  So they came out with the talking points the day before making this big decision, because this is a huge decision.
[02:14:12.353 --> 02:14:14.673]  This is Fox News essentially shooting themselves in the foot.
[02:14:14.673 --> 02:14:20.434]  This is Fox News essentially cancelling themselves, destroying their livelihood, destroying any kind of ability of people even
[02:14:20.954 --> 02:14:25.058]  Being able to watch them from now on, because who else is going to be watching them?
[02:14:25.058 --> 02:14:31.263]  The older kind of boomer demographics that are slowly and surely disappearing into the wayside?
[02:14:31.263 --> 02:14:32.324]  People want the truth.
[02:14:32.324 --> 02:14:33.966]  People are hungry for the truth.
[02:14:33.966 --> 02:14:44.535]  Tucker, again, I disagreed with him on some kind of assessments, on some kind of his opinions, but he was the closest to at least having a fair and honest conversation in this country.
[02:14:44.895 --> 02:14:48.337]  And that's more than almost anyone else in the corporate media is doing right now.
[02:14:48.337 --> 02:14:52.680]  That's just regurgitating all the talking points of the establishment.
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:15:05.569]  That's regurgitating all the larger psyopsis that they're running on everyone, that is meant to fulfill a larger depopulation agenda, a larger agenda that is unhuman, that is essentially serving their death cult.
[02:15:05.569 --> 02:15:06.029]  I agree.
[02:15:06.029 --> 02:15:09.692]  We're going to break here in a moment, but when we come back, you're really a smart guy that I respect.
[02:15:09.692 --> 02:15:11.013]  I've been with the fight a long time.
[02:15:12.355 --> 02:15:13.856]  How is it going for the New World Order?
[02:15:33.932 --> 02:15:38.755]  They do take a step back sometimes, but they're very strategic in how they operate and how they move forward.
[02:15:38.755 --> 02:15:47.741]  Now, the most confusing move for me to understand here, because I could see how the chess game is played out here, but they're still putting Joe Biden up front.
[02:15:47.741 --> 02:15:53.464]  And I think he's going to be a sacrificed pawn in the larger game that's being played here, because clearly he's not all there.
[02:15:53.464 --> 02:15:53.704]  I agree.
[02:15:53.704 --> 02:15:53.984]  Stay there.
[02:15:53.984 --> 02:15:54.845]  Let's talk about the election.
[02:15:59.696 --> 02:16:02.838]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:16:02.838 --> 02:16:05.139]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:16:05.139 --> 02:16:09.081]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:16:09.081 --> 02:16:18.005]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:16:18.005 --> 02:16:25.789]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:16:26.821 --> 02:16:30.443]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:16:30.443 --> 02:16:36.247]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:16:36.247 --> 02:16:39.288]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:16:39.288 --> 02:16:48.214]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:16:48.214 --> 02:16:51.796]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:52.496 --> 02:16:57.458]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars4.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:16:57.458 --> 02:16:59.418]  Please take action now.
[02:16:59.418 --> 02:17:00.799]  InfoWars.
[02:17:00.799 --> 02:17:02.820]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:04.580]  This is their big move.
[02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:08.381]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:17:08.381 --> 02:17:10.082]  He doesn't care.
[02:17:10.082 --> 02:17:11.342]  That's not his job.
[02:17:11.342 --> 02:17:13.083]  He's not the President of the United States.
[02:17:13.083 --> 02:17:16.944]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:17:16.944 --> 02:17:18.325]  Appetites of the autocrat.
[02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:29.396]  And that's who he works with.
[02:17:29.396 --> 02:17:30.277]  Exactly.
[02:17:30.277 --> 02:17:33.859]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:17:33.859 --> 02:17:36.961]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:17:36.961 --> 02:17:39.443]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:17:39.443 --> 02:17:41.944]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:17:41.944 --> 02:17:45.567]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:17:45.567 --> 02:17:48.089]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:17:48.089 --> 02:17:48.489]  You're right!
[02:17:48.749 --> 02:17:58.381]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no, and we say no to your war.
[02:17:58.381 --> 02:18:01.925]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:18:06.676 --> 02:18:07.997]  I want you all to know something.
[02:18:07.997 --> 02:18:09.978]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:09.978 --> 02:18:13.499]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:18:13.499 --> 02:18:16.441]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:18:16.441 --> 02:18:20.863]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:18:20.863 --> 02:18:23.084]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:23.084 --> 02:18:26.625]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:18:26.625 --> 02:18:30.067]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:18:30.327 --> 02:18:33.209]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:18:33.209 --> 02:18:34.229]  Years ago.
[02:18:34.229 --> 02:18:38.312]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:18:38.312 --> 02:18:40.834]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:18:40.834 --> 02:18:43.295]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:18:43.295 --> 02:18:46.417]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:18:46.417 --> 02:18:51.060]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:18:58.484 --> 02:19:05.909]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[02:19:05.909 --> 02:19:08.710]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:19:08.710 --> 02:19:17.076]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[02:19:17.076 --> 02:19:19.497]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[02:19:19.497 --> 02:19:22.499]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[02:19:22.819 --> 02:19:25.380]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:33.783]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[02:19:33.783 --> 02:19:35.644]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[02:19:35.644 --> 02:19:42.727]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:19:42.727 --> 02:19:47.929]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:51.330]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:54.031]  And a remedy to this madness.
[02:19:54.031 --> 02:19:59.134]  Available now at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:19:59.134 --> 02:20:05.038]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:11.938 --> 02:20:13.819]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Show, Thursday Edition.
[02:20:13.819 --> 02:20:17.321]  WeAreChange.com is the great website of Luke Berkowski.
[02:20:17.321 --> 02:20:18.922]  Luke, there's so many points to hit.
[02:20:18.922 --> 02:20:19.942]  I've got so many questions.
[02:20:19.942 --> 02:20:21.523]  Let me do a little bit of housekeeping here.
[02:20:21.523 --> 02:20:22.584]  I'm not mad at these folks.
[02:20:22.584 --> 02:20:25.806]  We've seen a lot of calls from the media and a lot of emails.
[02:20:25.806 --> 02:20:27.126]  We'll put it on screen.
[02:20:27.126 --> 02:20:29.628]  No, I have not been let back on Twitter.
[02:20:29.628 --> 02:20:34.410]  There are a lot of accounts out there that say they're Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.410 --> 02:20:37.692]  And so real A Jones with a Z is not me.
[02:20:37.692 --> 02:20:40.534]  But I like the stuff they're saying and they're doing.
[02:20:40.534 --> 02:20:40.714]  But
[02:20:41.550 --> 02:20:45.093]  They admit on the site, not the real Alex Jones.
[02:20:45.093 --> 02:20:47.155]  So everybody else out there, that is not me.
[02:20:47.155 --> 02:20:50.138]  I've been not let back on Twitter.
[02:20:50.138 --> 02:20:54.222]  Though I've noticed our videos are going more viral than ever and they're not being censored like they were.
[02:20:54.222 --> 02:21:04.932]  So Luke, again, the view from space here, beyond 35,000 feet, the view from 200,000 feet, how's it going for the New World Order?
[02:21:05.595 --> 02:21:08.056]  Where do you see them going?
[02:21:08.056 --> 02:21:11.098]  The whole world's turning against them, it seems, but they never give up.
[02:21:11.098 --> 02:21:19.802]  I'm really worried about power outages, hack attacks, cyber attacks, expanding war with Russia, China going into Taiwan.
[02:21:19.802 --> 02:21:25.445]  On your geopolitical radar screen, yeah, we're doing well, but how would you describe the lay of the land right now?
[02:21:26.638 --> 02:21:30.943]  Well, you know, the war in Ukraine is meant to be prolonged, not to be won.
[02:21:30.943 --> 02:21:44.598]  And when you look at the Americans' decisions when it comes to arming and giving them weapons and all this latest technology, it's always enough just to make sure that they just fight a little bit longer, and a little bit longer, to the point where they're actually running out of people now.
[02:21:45.178 --> 02:21:49.224]  And it's a horrible, horrible situation unfolding in that country right now.
[02:21:49.224 --> 02:21:53.130]  But when you kind of scan back here, there's a lot of different things at play here.
[02:21:53.130 --> 02:22:00.921]  For me personally, I do believe the financial picture is the one worth looking into, especially when it comes to central bank digital currencies.
[02:22:01.681 --> 02:22:17.070]  I think they try different things and they kind of move on to the next things in order to shock people because obviously we had 9-11, obviously we had the financial banking crisis in 2008, obviously we had COVID and that larger kind of psyops that played out against the American people and the people of the world.
[02:22:17.070 --> 02:22:18.471]  Now what's the latest thing?
[02:22:18.471 --> 02:22:26.496]  I think geopolitically there's a big component to this proxy war escalating and continuing on for a very long time.
[02:22:26.496 --> 02:22:28.097]  Conflicts are very easy to start.
[02:22:28.097 --> 02:22:30.198]  They're very hard to stop.
[02:22:30.658 --> 02:22:38.080]  And when you look at, you know, a lot of the sectarian conflicts, which the conflict in Ukraine is, Ukraine is like the Afghanistan of Europe.
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:39.360]  There's a lot of bloodshed there.
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:40.720]  There's a lot of history there.
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:45.241]  There's a lot of turmoil and war that unfolded in that specific region.
[02:22:45.241 --> 02:22:49.382]  And once that conflict started, I knew this was going to be continuing for a very long time.
[02:22:49.382 --> 02:22:51.862]  CNN was saying, oh, this is only going to last a week.
[02:22:51.862 --> 02:22:55.503]  I was like, no, this could last years, this could last decades.
[02:22:55.503 --> 02:22:59.644]  And if we look at what's even happening in the Middle East, these conflicts don't go away.
[02:22:59.924 --> 02:23:02.826]  They're going to be continuing for a very long time, and I think that's what they want.
[02:23:02.826 --> 02:23:04.927]  They want this kind of larger instability.
[02:23:04.927 --> 02:23:07.628]  They want that larger threat against everyone else.
[02:23:07.628 --> 02:23:17.313]  They want the cards stacked against everyone else with the larger austerity measures that are being pushed, because the war in Ukraine, as long as it's prolonged, achieves a number of different things.
[02:23:17.313 --> 02:23:21.395]  Specifically, when it comes to denying poor people energy, that's great.
[02:23:21.395 --> 02:23:22.175]  That's perfect for them.
[02:23:22.175 --> 02:23:25.617]  Destroying poor people in the middle class, that's what they've been doing.
[02:23:25.617 --> 02:23:28.198]  The war in Ukraine helps accelerate that.
[02:23:28.198 --> 02:23:29.439]  When it comes to starving people,
[02:23:30.140 --> 02:23:30.500]  We're good to go!
[02:23:49.477 --> 02:23:50.117]  We're good to go!
[02:24:13.065 --> 02:24:22.308]  The bigger likelihood of infrastructure attacks, digital attacks, cyber 9-11s, which we know the World Economic Forum and many other Davos elites have been working towards.
[02:24:22.308 --> 02:24:30.371]  So I do see infrastructure and the economy being the two major points as the war in Ukraine is still going to be continuing on for a very long time.
[02:24:30.371 --> 02:24:34.513]  As the major problems ahead for humanity that we are going to have to deal with because
[02:24:35.133 --> 02:24:44.038]  When you have a destruction of the American currency, of the US petrol dollar, as deliberately as it's happening right now, you're going to have a lot of really negative effects.
[02:24:44.038 --> 02:24:50.562]  All of this was kind of accelerated during COVID, especially when the lockdowns were started under the Trump administration.
[02:24:51.302 --> 02:24:59.407]  And I think this larger cascading effect of destroying people financially is going to continue to a crescendo moment where things just blow up.
[02:24:59.407 --> 02:25:01.128]  Infrastructure attacks, who's responsible?
[02:25:01.128 --> 02:25:01.649]  No, I agree.
[02:25:01.649 --> 02:25:04.831]  And they use the wars and all that as the excuse for what happened.
[02:25:04.831 --> 02:25:07.873]  Well, I mean, take the State Department on record last year.
[02:25:07.873 --> 02:25:16.578]  They're on record getting Bolsonaro out and putting in Lula, who then immediately runs to China and says, we're going off the dollar to your currency.
[02:25:16.578 --> 02:25:18.699]  So the State Department knew what they were doing.
[02:25:18.699 --> 02:25:19.400]  Why are they?
[02:25:20.475 --> 02:25:31.689]  This slow decline of the American currency, why would they take the most powerful thing America has and then do this Ukraine war and push everybody into bricks and push Russia into a merger with China?
[02:25:32.689 --> 02:25:34.010]  These people aren't American.
[02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:36.191]  These people do not care about America.
[02:25:36.191 --> 02:25:39.954]  America is just a tool for them, essentially.
[02:25:39.954 --> 02:25:46.057]  When you look at a lot of these larger billionaires, especially the types of Bill Gates, there's a reason that they do a lot of business with China.
[02:25:46.057 --> 02:25:51.781]  There's a reason some of the latest nuclear technological developments are being developed between Bill Gates and China right now.
[02:25:51.781 --> 02:25:53.622]  There's a reason Bill Gates is helping out the Chinese.
[02:25:54.282 --> 02:26:01.464]  A military, because the system that they want to implement globally is essentially the Chinese social credit score system.
[02:26:01.464 --> 02:26:16.007]  A system that tracks, databases you, punishes you, and prevents you from being able to buy train tickets because you defaulted on your loan, or you didn't say the right thing, or you jaywalked, or you sneezed in the wrong public train car.
[02:26:16.007 --> 02:26:21.728]  So the system that they're trying to unfold here is a system that they've been testing
[02:26:22.208 --> 02:26:29.073]  In China for a very long time to see how people will comply and essentially they want that system everywhere in the entire world.
[02:26:29.073 --> 02:26:42.062]  What better way to do that than to get rid of the number one thing standing in their way and that of course is the financial sustainability of human beings, capitalism, free flow of money and markets that solve a lot of government problems.
[02:26:42.062 --> 02:26:43.323]  And the second thing is family.
[02:26:43.323 --> 02:26:44.724]  There's been a huge attack on the family.
[02:26:44.724 --> 02:26:47.826]  There's been huge attacks on individuals being able to reproduce.
[02:26:48.246 --> 02:27:04.354]  And actually have babies, because this actually goes into a deeper agenda of them setting up a Chinese social credit score technocratic nightmare, them living forever, while the plebs that are useless, according to Yoel Harari, who even admits this, are going to be of course pacified with drugs and video games.
[02:27:04.634 --> 02:27:08.895]  So in the longer perspective, in the longer picture, that's how I see everything unfolding.
[02:27:08.895 --> 02:27:10.135]  And these people are very deliberate.
[02:27:10.135 --> 02:27:11.436]  They're very smart.
[02:27:11.436 --> 02:27:15.236]  Two steps forward, one step back is usually the goals that they're doing.
[02:27:15.236 --> 02:27:19.777]  And I see eventually, in the near future, a cyber 9-11 financial crash.
[02:27:19.777 --> 02:27:20.378]  Is it Russia?
[02:27:20.378 --> 02:27:21.058]  Is it China?
[02:27:21.058 --> 02:27:21.578]  Who knows?
[02:27:21.578 --> 02:27:22.738]  Plausible deniability.
[02:27:22.738 --> 02:27:26.959]  But Russia in the picture here, with this conflict still going on in Ukraine.
[02:27:27.279 --> 02:27:29.820]  That's how I see it kind of moving forward from here.
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:36.504]  But it also depends on who is going to be the next president of the United States, and that is still up in the air.
[02:27:36.504 --> 02:27:39.406]  And that's what we hit before the segment ended, last segment.
[02:27:39.406 --> 02:27:40.506]  Let's start getting into that.
[02:27:40.506 --> 02:27:41.687]  We'll get into the next segment.
[02:27:41.687 --> 02:27:44.088]  You're saying Biden's a sacrificial lamb.
[02:27:44.088 --> 02:27:44.829]  Give us your view on that.
[02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:52.343]  Yeah, I mean, Nikki Haley came out today and talked about how he is probably not going to live for the next five years.
[02:27:52.343 --> 02:27:54.885]  And I don't care how many puppets of him they have.
[02:27:54.885 --> 02:28:01.352]  They could only have this facade for so long as, of course, a lot of people are seeing that the emperor has no clothes.
[02:28:01.352 --> 02:28:05.136]  A lot of people are saying, hey, this guy who could barely make a coherent statement
[02:28:05.496 --> 02:28:07.097]  He's making all the tough decisions here?
[02:28:07.097 --> 02:28:07.438]  No.
[02:28:07.438 --> 02:28:09.399]  Someone else is behind the scenes.
[02:28:09.399 --> 02:28:11.821]  And in one way, Biden is the perfect candidate.
[02:28:11.821 --> 02:28:18.567]  Because, again, he sits down, they give him a Fisher-Price kind of Oval Office, he presses buttons, but they don't really do anything.
[02:28:18.567 --> 02:28:20.388]  And there's a bureaucracy behind him.
[02:28:20.388 --> 02:28:21.769]  There's the guys with suits.
[02:28:22.810 --> 02:28:23.531]  We're good to go.
[02:28:51.112 --> 02:28:51.614]  No, I agree.
[02:28:51.614 --> 02:28:54.864]  So let's talk about how that unfolds and how we stop it with Luke Grodowski.
[02:28:54.864 --> 02:28:55.606]  Straight ahead.
[02:28:58.410 --> 02:29:03.432]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:29:03.432 --> 02:29:05.612]  We made it even stronger.
[02:29:05.612 --> 02:29:09.353]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:29:09.353 --> 02:29:14.475]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:29:14.475 --> 02:29:22.658]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:29:22.658 --> 02:29:23.758]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:29:24.418 --> 02:29:37.488]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:29:37.488 --> 02:29:39.490]  It is the super fuel.
[02:29:39.490 --> 02:29:40.951]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:29:40.951 --> 02:29:41.812]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:29:41.812 --> 02:29:42.772]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:29:42.772 --> 02:29:43.953]  They go good with this.
[02:29:43.953 --> 02:29:45.995]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:29:46.713 --> 02:29:48.194]  This is the Boss.
[02:29:48.194 --> 02:29:48.915]  TurboForce.
[02:29:48.915 --> 02:29:49.956]  Back in stock.
[02:29:49.956 --> 02:29:50.956]  Discounted.
[02:29:50.956 --> 02:29:52.678]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:29:59.023 --> 02:30:10.992]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.

[02:31:06.698 --> 02:31:15.425]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:31:15.425 --> 02:31:17.607]  So support InfoWarsTore.
[02:31:17.607 --> 02:31:22.531]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know.
[02:31:22.531 --> 02:31:26.074]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[02:31:26.074 --> 02:31:30.758]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[02:31:30.758 --> 02:31:31.379]  Krill oil.
[02:31:31.619 --> 02:31:39.426]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[02:31:39.426 --> 02:31:45.431]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[02:31:45.431 --> 02:31:48.173]  Vitamin C and Zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[02:31:48.173 --> 02:31:50.355]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[02:31:50.355 --> 02:31:52.276]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[02:31:52.276 --> 02:31:55.619]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[02:31:55.619 --> 02:31:57.661]  You have to have these products.
[02:31:58.223 --> 02:32:10.899]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border, exposing the cartels, and, like, coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[02:32:10.899 --> 02:32:12.661]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:32:12.661 --> 02:32:14.444]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:32:14.818 --> 02:32:17.620]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:19.341]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:32:19.341 --> 02:32:21.863]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[02:32:21.863 --> 02:32:26.226]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:32:26.226 --> 02:32:31.930]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[02:32:31.930 --> 02:32:36.914]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[02:32:36.914 --> 02:32:40.056]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[02:32:40.196 --> 02:32:44.739]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.

[02:34:28.516 --> 02:34:29.737]  All right, back to Luke Rodowski.
[02:34:30.851 --> 02:34:36.373]  I can ask again a million questions, and I've got a million questions, but what else are you really focused on?
[02:34:36.373 --> 02:34:38.794]  What are you most concerned about right now?
[02:34:38.794 --> 02:34:42.575]  We started getting into Biden earlier, and you talk about a sacrificial lamb.
[02:34:42.575 --> 02:34:45.396]  Yeah, he gets the blame for all the tyranny.
[02:34:45.396 --> 02:34:46.957]  I'm worried they might assassinate him.
[02:34:46.957 --> 02:34:48.318]  People say, well, they'll just put Kamala in.
[02:34:48.318 --> 02:34:49.638]  Well, who knows?
[02:34:49.638 --> 02:34:54.740]  What do you think, because you're a deep researcher, they're planning with the next election a year and a half away?
[02:34:55.989 --> 02:34:59.271]  I think we have to understand that there's an illusion of choice.
[02:34:59.271 --> 02:35:00.812]  The left and right are compromised.
[02:35:00.812 --> 02:35:02.353]  No one is coming to save you.
[02:35:02.353 --> 02:35:06.836]  You have to save yourself by making very smart decisions for yourself as an individual.
[02:35:06.836 --> 02:35:13.541]  But when it comes to the political landscape, let's go over through some of the candidates here because they all have their pros and they all have their cons.
[02:35:13.541 --> 02:35:18.284]  And I think it's important kind of analyzing everything from a fair and honest perspective because a lot of people
[02:35:18.664 --> 02:35:19.625]  Have a lot of blinders on.
[02:35:19.625 --> 02:35:30.896]  They only want to see what they want to see and I think it's important to explore into the deeper ends of who people really are, their records and how things are going to be moving forward because there's obviously Ron DeSantis.
[02:35:30.896 --> 02:35:33.238]  I think he hangs out with Jeb Bush way too much.
[02:35:33.238 --> 02:35:36.461]  I don't think he's politically smart for attacking Trump at the peak of his indictment.
[02:35:37.161 --> 02:35:43.924]  And he doesn't really have a backbone as he backpedaled on his very soft statement on Ukraine, which was disappointing.
[02:35:43.924 --> 02:35:47.245]  But when it comes to COVID, he has an almost impeccable record.
[02:35:47.245 --> 02:36:03.752]  He was perfect during those key moments and situations that truly made the biggest difference when it came to pushing back against the lockdowns and the draconian policies that, let's be honest here, were put forward by Donald Trump, who still hasn't recused himself, who still hasn't come out and said, hey,
[02:36:04.352 --> 02:36:11.333]  You know, when those 600 doctors came to me with a signed letter begging me not to do lockdowns, maybe I should have listened to them.
[02:36:11.333 --> 02:36:12.214]  And he didn't.
[02:36:12.214 --> 02:36:15.854]  Donald Trump's administration implemented the 15 days to slow the spread.
[02:36:15.854 --> 02:36:17.535]  They're the ones who implemented the lockdowns.
[02:36:17.535 --> 02:36:24.836]  They gave everyone 2K checks, which were absolutely nothing compared to the mega bucks that were given to all the major corporations.
[02:36:24.836 --> 02:36:32.918]  Billions of them were just handed out to the big pharma, to the military industrial complex, to, of course, all the other big international corporate giants out there.
[02:36:32.918 --> 02:36:34.038]  Trump went on and attacked
[02:36:34.338 --> 02:36:34.718]  We're good
[02:36:57.483 --> 02:36:57.983]  I don't know.
[02:37:21.582 --> 02:37:31.025]  Douglas McGregor actually came out and said that he was hired by the Trump administration during the last days of his office to try to get all the troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.
[02:37:31.025 --> 02:37:34.906]  Trump agreed with it, signed it, and then didn't follow through.
[02:37:34.906 --> 02:37:43.529]  Trump also promised that he was going to release the JFK papers, and then of course he didn't, which shows us who's really in charge here when Trump's in office.
[02:37:43.529 --> 02:37:46.329]  And this is why I say there's a bigger kind of illusion here.
[02:37:46.329 --> 02:37:48.730]  There's a lot of other people behind the scenes here.
[02:37:48.730 --> 02:37:51.391]  Trump, again, called himself a nationalist and a
[02:37:51.391 --> 02:37:52.332]  He's a globalist.
[02:37:52.332 --> 02:37:54.954]  So he could be coming from very different perspectives.
[02:37:54.954 --> 02:37:57.316]  He has many different people pulling at his ear.
[02:37:57.316 --> 02:37:59.979]  He has a lot of other people making decisions for him as well.
[02:37:59.979 --> 02:38:07.346]  And when we look at this broader perspective, I'm worried about a Trump presidency, mainly because it looks like he's going to win.
[02:38:07.346 --> 02:38:09.728]  This indictment propelled him forward.
[02:38:09.728 --> 02:38:16.034]  And if he does win, specifically, if you are, let's just say, a Bill Gates or Dr. Fauci type,
[02:38:16.694 --> 02:38:20.556]  Uh, you know, and Joe Biden even just came out a few days ago.
[02:38:20.556 --> 02:38:24.518]  All of them came out and said, hey, the pandemic that we had was nothing.
[02:38:24.518 --> 02:38:25.778]  It was just a test run.
[02:38:25.778 --> 02:38:29.880]  They essentially said that there's going to be a bigger pandemic coming our way.
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:37.183]  But if Donald Trump becomes the president of the United States, which it looks like he's on the road to becoming the president of the United States,
[02:38:37.643 --> 02:38:53.595]  What better way to compromise him, to destroy his administration, than as soon as he comes out, release one of the other gain-of-function viruses that they've been working on and developing, and then checkmate Donald Trump is going to be doing whatever the intelligentsia state wants him to do.
[02:38:53.595 --> 02:38:57.618]  Going to doing another Warp Speed, going to promoting another vaccine.
[02:38:57.618 --> 02:39:00.340]  This is something that I just personally think about, that I personally worry.
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:02.823]  And I think it should be on our consensus.
[02:39:02.823 --> 02:39:05.386]  It should be something that we should be thinking about.
[02:39:05.386 --> 02:39:11.372]  And we should be trying to hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire so he comes out and says, hey guys, this was a big mistake here.
[02:39:11.372 --> 02:39:12.153]  I shouldn't have done this.
[02:39:12.153 --> 02:39:17.019]  But until I hear that, I'm going to be very skeptical of the lead frontrunner in the Republican ticket.
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:18.560]  I totally agree.
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:25.808]  He was great on the border, great setting up in China, so many other things, getting us out of the WHO, but then he just transferred it to Fauci and Bill Gates.
[02:39:25.808 --> 02:39:26.489]  So then what?
[02:39:26.489 --> 02:39:29.412]  I'm not a lesser to evils guys, but what do we do?
[02:39:29.412 --> 02:39:30.913]  Support DeSantis?
[02:39:30.913 --> 02:39:31.614]  Support Joe Biden?
[02:39:31.614 --> 02:39:34.197]  Or just say, hey, these presidents are all puppets.
[02:39:34.197 --> 02:39:34.977]  They can't save us.
[02:39:34.977 --> 02:39:39.242]  We've got to take over our local governments, legally and lawfully, and just block it at that level and just not comply.
[02:39:40.345 --> 02:39:42.106]  Personally, the conversation matters.
[02:39:42.106 --> 02:39:43.566]  Your input, your voice matters.
[02:39:43.566 --> 02:39:52.810]  Holding Donald Trump accountable, even if you like Donald Trump, is extremely important because these people rely on us and our consensus and our acquiescence to them.
[02:39:52.810 --> 02:40:03.394]  And if we stop giving them all of our power and we hold them accountable and we stop worshipping politicians... I think people who support politicians are individuals who believe strippers really like them at the strip club.
[02:40:03.394 --> 02:40:05.195]  They're individuals that are obviously
[02:40:05.795 --> 02:40:07.776]  In it for, you know, themselves here.
[02:40:07.776 --> 02:40:09.997]  Obviously we're in a very tough situation here.
[02:40:09.997 --> 02:40:12.518]  The dialogue and the conversation matter.
[02:40:12.518 --> 02:40:15.639]  And again, even though I don't agree with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:40:15.639 --> 02:40:19.040]  on a lot of his policies, he's starting a conversation about the vaccines.
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:22.281]  He's starting a conversation about our medical system.
[02:40:22.281 --> 02:40:27.243]  Conversations that could make people empowered with choices in their own lives.
[02:40:27.243 --> 02:40:28.364]  That's right.
[02:40:28.364 --> 02:40:28.444]  R.L.K.
[02:40:28.444 --> 02:40:32.865]  Jr., in spite of his policies, has the total establishment against him.
[02:40:32.865 --> 02:40:34.646]  Trump only has part of the establishment against him.
[02:40:35.635 --> 02:40:38.396]  What matters most is the ideas and the conversations.
[02:40:38.396 --> 02:40:40.916]  And we can't be afraid to have tough conversations.
[02:40:40.916 --> 02:40:43.517]  We can't be afraid to criticize our own side.
[02:40:43.517 --> 02:40:47.178]  I'm even going as far as saying, hey, Tucker Carlson 2024.
[02:40:47.178 --> 02:40:53.720]  I just launched a t-shirt on thebestpoliticalshirts.com, specifically launching a Tucker Carlson for President of the United States.
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:41:00.282]  Because even if, you know, that's not really kind of logical, maybe it will happen, maybe it won't.
[02:41:00.282 --> 02:41:02.382]  I'm playing the same thing, so it's a great idea.
[02:41:02.382 --> 02:41:04.863]  Just to say the ideas we like for President.
[02:41:05.971 --> 02:41:06.894]  Exactly.
[02:41:06.894 --> 02:41:15.274]  And those ideas and those conversations and holding our representatives feet to the fire and saying, hey, we as American people, you need us.
[02:41:16.178 --> 02:41:20.020]  You need us to go along with your larger messaging here.
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:23.202]  Obviously we are in a lot of trouble.
[02:41:23.202 --> 02:41:29.385]  Obviously we're heading down a path of very bad situations that are going to be hitting everyone.
[02:41:29.385 --> 02:41:36.249]  And this is the time that I think we have to stop looking for politicians as the saviors of us.
[02:41:36.249 --> 02:41:36.789]  We have to stop
[02:41:36.889 --> 02:41:39.830]  But instead it's tools that we have to make work for us.
[02:41:56.657 --> 02:41:58.198]  What a great way to end the week.
[02:41:58.198 --> 02:42:03.159]  Truly, that was a great segment, and I'm just grateful that you came on, and I'm especially grateful for the pie.
[02:42:03.159 --> 02:42:04.000]  Thank you for having me.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:04.840]  Appreciate it.
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:05.820]  Employee of the Week.
[02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:07.341]  We're just going to make it of the year.
[02:42:07.341 --> 02:42:09.221]  Tyler Morrell of Coco's Pizza.
[02:42:09.221 --> 02:42:11.282]  That's it for us for the week.
[02:42:11.282 --> 02:42:12.363]  We'll be back.
[02:42:12.363 --> 02:42:17.104]  By the way, the entire episode of Let Them Eat Bugs, not quite as good as pizza, streaming now on Fox Station.
[02:42:17.104 --> 02:42:21.566]  Use the promo code ORIGINALS for 30 days free, and we'll be back on Monday.
[02:42:21.566 --> 02:42:24.887]  In the meantime, have the best weekend with the ones that you love, and we'll see you then.
[02:42:26.155 --> 02:42:30.197]  Then he left and gave a Heritage Foundation speech that I thought was particularly powerful.
[02:42:30.197 --> 02:42:32.278]  Luke, we'll talk about that, too, before we get into the bugs.
[02:42:32.278 --> 02:42:34.739]  We come back where he said, it's good versus evil.
[02:42:34.739 --> 02:42:37.760]  We have to stop being mindless drones, lemmings.
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:40.161]  We have to stop going with the herd mentality.
[02:42:40.161 --> 02:42:41.702]  That is so true.
[02:42:41.702 --> 02:42:43.722]  And he said, both parties are the problem.
[02:42:43.722 --> 02:42:45.563]  They're working together against you.
[02:42:45.563 --> 02:42:47.864]  And that's what the system cannot stand.
[02:42:47.864 --> 02:42:49.625]  Luke Rodowski, We Are Change.
[02:42:49.625 --> 02:42:51.045]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.
[02:42:51.045 --> 02:42:51.686]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:51.686 --> 02:42:52.046]  Stay with us.
[02:42:58.627 --> 02:43:04.629]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:43:04.629 --> 02:43:07.269]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:09.450]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:43:09.450 --> 02:43:12.050]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:15.271]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:43:15.271 --> 02:43:17.032]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:43:17.032 --> 02:43:23.653]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:43:23.653 --> 02:43:26.454]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:43:27.421 --> 02:43:29.522]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.

[02:45:07.758 --> 02:45:09.699]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:09.699 --> 02:45:13.261]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:45:13.261 --> 02:45:16.363]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:45:16.363 --> 02:45:20.625]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:45:20.625 --> 02:45:22.827]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:22.827 --> 02:45:26.369]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:45:26.369 --> 02:45:29.811]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:45:30.091 --> 02:45:32.953]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:45:32.953 --> 02:45:33.993]  Years ago.
[02:45:33.993 --> 02:45:36.055]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[02:45:36.055 --> 02:45:38.056]  Not for a second.
[02:45:38.056 --> 02:45:40.578]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:45:40.578 --> 02:45:43.039]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:45:43.039 --> 02:45:46.161]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:45:46.161 --> 02:45:47.722]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[02:45:47.722 --> 02:45:50.804]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:45:59.491 --> 02:46:02.612]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:46:02.612 --> 02:46:04.912]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:46:04.912 --> 02:46:08.853]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:46:08.853 --> 02:46:17.774]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:46:17.774 --> 02:46:24.676]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:46:24.676 --> 02:46:25.556]  It's really just incredible.
[02:46:26.582 --> 02:46:30.244]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:46:30.244 --> 02:46:36.027]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:46:36.027 --> 02:46:38.489]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:46:38.489 --> 02:46:39.069]  Keep doing it.
[02:46:39.069 --> 02:46:46.113]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:46:46.113 --> 02:46:47.294]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:46:47.934 --> 02:46:52.258]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:46:52.258 --> 02:46:57.243]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:46:57.243 --> 02:46:59.385]  Please take action now.
[02:46:59.385 --> 02:47:05.291]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:24.091 --> 02:47:28.773]  There's an article up on AppleWars.com that really caught my imagination.
[02:47:49.421 --> 02:47:50.462]  And there's no audio to it.
[02:47:50.462 --> 02:47:52.504]  It's a surveillance camera.
[02:47:52.504 --> 02:47:55.787]  The Arizona Capitol has a private lounge.
[02:47:55.787 --> 02:47:58.089]  Private companies have restaurants, lounges.
[02:47:58.089 --> 02:47:59.270]  They lease it.
[02:47:59.270 --> 02:48:00.030]  They provide a lounge.
[02:48:00.030 --> 02:48:02.052]  They provide food, drinks.
[02:48:02.052 --> 02:48:07.757]  And they kept having the Bibles removed and out of the lounge so that security had a camera there.
[02:48:09.178 --> 02:48:23.790]  A Democrat lawmaker, ordained minister, who goes around speaking out against the Bible, that's why she became an ordained minister, obviously because of the wolf in sheep's clothing, caught swiping and hiding Bibles in a private lounge in Arizona's state capitol.
[02:48:23.790 --> 02:48:25.911]  Now, you think, well that's just one crazy person.
[02:48:25.911 --> 02:48:30.995]  You know it's over 20,000 churches in the last five years burned down and destroyed in Europe.
[02:48:30.995 --> 02:48:32.196]  What's happening here?
[02:48:32.196 --> 02:48:35.599]  These people are demonically controlled.
[02:48:35.599 --> 02:48:36.740]  Doesn't mean churches are perfect.
[02:48:38.305 --> 02:48:42.316]  But it's the Bible that drives them crazy and it's the churches that are promoting that.
[02:48:43.797 --> 02:48:46.098]  They're attacking because they want the state to be God.
[02:48:46.098 --> 02:48:50.500]  And they infiltrated the seminaries, the Protestant, the Catholic, all of it, and they're doing this.
[02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:53.441]  Before I get to the other news, I wanted to talk about this, Luke.
[02:48:53.441 --> 02:48:57.283]  A dim lawmaker caught hiding Bibles at Arizona Capitol.
[02:48:57.283 --> 02:49:00.484]  What do you think, you know, Elon Musk talks about good versus evil.
[02:49:00.484 --> 02:49:08.467]  Tucker Carlson said, you know, he didn't really believe in God, but he said now he sees it everywhere that we should pray and that there is an evil force trying to destroy us.
[02:49:08.467 --> 02:49:09.908]  What's your personal view on that?
[02:49:11.238 --> 02:49:24.070]  It depends on how far you want to go down the rabbit hole, because we could have a four hour long conversation about this, but I think just to kind of simplify it and just to make it as short and as sweet as possible here, there is a larger spiritual war out there.
[02:49:24.070 --> 02:49:35.320]  You can feel it, especially when you start speaking truth, living the truest version of yourselves and not stifling yourself and just representing who you are as a human being and starting those conversations and trying to help people.
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:37.262]  When you help people, you feel good.
[02:49:37.762 --> 02:49:40.584]  When you don't help people, when you lie to people.
[02:49:40.584 --> 02:49:42.365]  Now imagine this on a larger scale.
[02:49:42.365 --> 02:49:54.213]  When you start wars, when you release bioweapons, when you run larger psyopsis, when you run social media companies that are creating depression, suicide, and self-harm in young children.
[02:49:54.213 --> 02:49:57.876]  Imagine how you feel doing those things.
[02:49:57.876 --> 02:49:59.657]  And I do believe a lot of these people
[02:50:00.477 --> 02:50:09.360]  You know, there's a famous saying, you always got two wolves in you, one's a happy, positive, loved one, one's filled with hate and anger and destitute.
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:27.586]  I do believe that once you spiral, your kind of frequency, your energy in those realms becomes very, very prominent to the point where there are other kind of entities, there are other larger energies in this world that are attracted to that, that do take over when that happens and do have a bigger calling to that.
[02:50:27.586 --> 02:50:27.926]  This is why...
[02:50:28.626 --> 02:50:34.631]  They want to be reminded of the way out or of God or of higher levels so that's why they attack it.
[02:50:34.631 --> 02:50:44.298]  And they're allergic to it and they're afraid of it because then they have to give up their demons and there's a reason a lot of people in the music industry literally say that they sold their soul to the devil.
[02:50:44.298 --> 02:50:48.782]  Bob Dylan in multiple interviews said, no I sold my soul to Satan.
[02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:50.270]  Exactly.
[02:50:50.270 --> 02:50:57.092]  Mock child sacrifices, worshiping Moloch, doing unspeakable things in coffins at Yale.
[02:50:57.092 --> 02:50:59.353]  I mean, it's not us being the weirdos, right?
[02:50:59.353 --> 02:51:04.414]  We can only talk about it on a kind of surface level, you know, to the public.
[02:51:04.414 --> 02:51:05.975]  Even then, people are going to think we're crazy.
[02:51:05.975 --> 02:51:06.555]  We're not crazy!
[02:51:06.995 --> 02:51:18.245]  The people in the coffins, the people running around in the woods naked doing mock child sacrifice, they're the crazy ones and they're the ones at the helm of a lot of powerful institutions calling the shots here making a lot of decisions.
[02:51:18.245 --> 02:51:20.287]  And remember CERN did mock human sacrifices.
[02:51:22.048 --> 02:51:22.669]  We're good to go.
[02:51:44.091 --> 02:51:49.593]  Exactly, and that's why they have their symbols, and their symbols are also connected to this larger kind of force out there.
[02:51:49.593 --> 02:51:51.634]  We might be going too far into the rabbit hole here.
[02:51:51.634 --> 02:51:54.956]  I don't know how far you want to go here, Alex, but we could go down further if you want.
[02:51:54.956 --> 02:51:56.116]  Oh, we could go all the way to the bottom.
[02:51:56.116 --> 02:51:57.517]  No, it's good versus evil.
[02:51:57.517 --> 02:51:58.017]  Go ahead.
[02:51:58.017 --> 02:51:58.917]  Absolutely.
[02:51:58.917 --> 02:51:59.858]  Take us to the bottom, Luke.
[02:51:59.858 --> 02:52:01.498]  You're a smart guy, don't you?
[02:52:01.498 --> 02:52:02.779]  18, 19 years.
[02:52:02.779 --> 02:52:05.260]  At the bottom of the rabbit hole, what's there?
[02:52:07.323 --> 02:52:10.165]  It's a larger fight between good and evil as you described.
[02:52:10.165 --> 02:52:11.426]  It's an energetic force.
[02:52:11.426 --> 02:52:17.051]  The life that we're living on right now has many different dimensions that we're not privy to, that our senses are not aware of.
[02:52:17.051 --> 02:52:26.779]  And when you really truly do look at it, you have to be extremely careful how you navigate this world with your own personal decisions because every little decision you take matters.
[02:52:26.779 --> 02:52:28.000]  And this is what they're afraid of.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:29.441]  They're afraid of the conversations.
[02:52:29.441 --> 02:52:32.123]  They're afraid of you even knowing that there's another side.
[02:52:32.123 --> 02:52:33.985]  They're afraid of you seeing them.
[02:52:34.565 --> 02:52:40.849]  And once you see them for who they truly are, that absolutely destroys the whole facade.
[02:52:40.849 --> 02:52:45.953]  The whole game is over once you're able to see everything that there really are.
[02:52:45.953 --> 02:52:48.054]  So this is why it's so important for independent media.
[02:52:48.054 --> 02:52:54.099]  This is why it's so important that voices out there go out there and speak the larger truth, because there is a larger residency.
[02:52:54.099 --> 02:52:55.379]  There is a larger frequency.
[02:52:55.379 --> 02:52:56.140]  There is something.
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:53:08.853]  Once you start doing good, once you start speaking truth, that you feel a weight lifted off of you, that you feel this larger, on a small micro level, a part of the larger spiritual war, and it starts with you being the best version of yourself.
[02:53:08.853 --> 02:53:11.416]  And that's why they got so mad at Tucker, because I'm told that
[02:53:11.716 --> 02:53:14.957]  They were already planning to get rid of him before his contract was up in six months.
[02:53:14.957 --> 02:53:16.878]  Folks, you're getting the inside here.
[02:53:16.878 --> 02:53:24.081]  But when when when Rupert Murdoch, a month before, was in Bel Air with his new girlfriend, his fiancée, and Tucker was invited.
[02:53:24.081 --> 02:53:25.221]  She wanted him there.
[02:53:25.221 --> 02:53:27.642]  She read the Bible, Exodus.
[02:53:27.642 --> 02:53:29.803]  She said, I think Tucker's a messenger of God.
[02:53:29.803 --> 02:53:32.504]  Murdoch left the table, didn't talk to him again.
[02:53:32.504 --> 02:53:33.644]  And now this happened.
[02:53:33.644 --> 02:53:35.285]  And then they saw that speech.
[02:53:35.965 --> 02:53:41.713]  At the Heritage Foundation, where he said we gotta call on God, cause that's us with our free will saying we're open to the good.
[02:53:41.713 --> 02:53:43.615]  They don't want us to open that channel, that's why.
[02:53:43.615 --> 02:53:45.378]  It was the final straw, was God.
[02:53:46.765 --> 02:53:46.945]  It's a
[02:54:16.425 --> 02:54:17.926]  And evil is characterized by their opposites.
[02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:47.836]  Violence, hate, disorder, division, disorganization, and filth.
[02:54:47.836 --> 02:54:57.564]  So if you are all in on the things that produce the latter basket of outcomes, what you're really advocating for is evil.
[02:54:57.564 --> 02:54:59.186]  That's just true.
[02:54:59.186 --> 02:55:05.231]  Those are manifestations of some larger force acting upon us.
[02:55:05.231 --> 02:55:07.012]  It's just so obvious.
[02:55:07.012 --> 02:55:08.173]  It's completely obvious.
[02:55:09.272 --> 02:55:16.657]  And even I have concluded, it might be worth taking just 10 minutes out of your busy schedule to say a prayer for the future.
[02:55:16.657 --> 02:55:18.398]  And I hope you will.
[02:55:18.398 --> 02:55:23.901]  Alright, so Tucker's told me personally, and I'm not bragging, it wasn't off record, but I never really talked about it because I don't want to give him problems.
[02:55:23.901 --> 02:55:24.982]  Now he's fully emerged, he's here.
[02:55:24.982 --> 02:55:27.463]  I woke him up 13 years ago, he came here to apologize.
[02:55:27.463 --> 02:55:32.186]  We've been friends since, hung out a lot, dinner, visited him, all that.
[02:55:32.186 --> 02:55:35.528]  But he's totally on board, totally awake.
[02:55:35.528 --> 02:55:37.970]  And it's not about Alex Jones getting the credit for this.
[02:55:39.079 --> 02:55:44.947]  This is the Lister supporting us, the guest, everybody, but it was this show that was the main thing that woke him up.
[02:55:44.947 --> 02:55:48.572]  Like with vampires, you know, Count Dracula, they say, well, Count Dracula bit me, now I'm a vampire.
[02:55:48.572 --> 02:55:49.894]  Well, it's the opposite.
[02:55:49.894 --> 02:55:52.017]  Infowars bit Tucker Carlson.
[02:55:52.017 --> 02:55:55.282]  And this is one of our biggest successes, folks, and so I'm very proud of it.
[02:55:55.282 --> 02:55:56.083]  Luke, comments on that.
[02:55:57.199 --> 02:55:59.681]  Well, you know, truth has a residency.
[02:55:59.681 --> 02:56:01.383]  It also has a frequency.
[02:56:01.383 --> 02:56:06.247]  You could try to deny it for as long as you can, but it surfaces to the top eventually.
[02:56:06.247 --> 02:56:08.029]  And when it does, there's a reckoning.
[02:56:08.029 --> 02:56:08.950]  There's an understanding.
[02:56:08.950 --> 02:56:11.673]  There is an awakening of the general public.
[02:56:12.353 --> 02:56:18.321]  We're going through that phrase right now, and this is why they're trying to accelerate their psyopsis as much as they are right now.
[02:56:18.321 --> 02:56:24.188]  He also had said something about prayer, which I think is absolutely important.
[02:56:24.188 --> 02:56:26.891]  Some people pray, some people meditate, whatever it is.
[02:56:27.312 --> 02:56:37.280]  But just taking 10 minutes to yourself, just to breathe, just to see who you are, what you are, just to try to tune yourself in, just to try to get your gut activated.
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:39.902]  There's a reason gut instincts are also extremely important.
[02:56:39.902 --> 02:56:47.709]  There's a reason the main weapon that they use against the population is to destroy their gut, which is key to their immune systems, which is key to their mental health.
[02:56:47.709 --> 02:56:51.952]  Because we know we have brain tissue in our spine that hooks into our gut.
[02:56:51.952 --> 02:56:56.036]  The gut is literally where we feel what our subconscious thinks.
[02:56:56.816 --> 02:57:05.117]  It's the second brain, and it's been directly under attack, not just by Big Pharma, but by the food industries, the medical industrial complex.
[02:57:05.117 --> 02:57:08.758]  Autism rates, by the way, since 1990, have gone up 2,094%.
[02:57:08.758 --> 02:57:12.219]  That is not a coincidence.
[02:57:12.219 --> 02:57:13.799]  That is not an accident.
[02:57:13.799 --> 02:57:17.340]  All the top institutions are just kind of like, whatever.
[02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:19.260]  These numbers are going up.
[02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:20.920]  Infertility is going up.
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:25.141]  Our ability to be healthy is being destroyed right in front of us because of this
[02:57:25.401 --> 02:57:26.782]  Our longevity is dropping.
[02:57:26.782 --> 02:57:27.883]  We've got to go to break for two minutes.
[02:57:27.883 --> 02:57:28.483]  Five more minutes.

[02:57:42.853 --> 02:57:44.094]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[02:57:47.881 --> 02:57:52.904]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:57:52.904 --> 02:57:55.065]  We made it even stronger.
[02:57:55.065 --> 02:57:58.807]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:57:58.807 --> 02:58:03.950]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:03.950 --> 02:58:11.794]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:58:11.794 --> 02:58:13.215]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:58:13.875 --> 02:58:26.944]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:58:26.944 --> 02:58:28.945]  It is the super fuel.
[02:58:28.945 --> 02:58:30.406]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:58:30.406 --> 02:58:31.266]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:58:31.266 --> 02:58:32.227]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:58:32.227 --> 02:58:33.408]  They go good with this.
[02:58:33.408 --> 02:58:35.449]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:58:36.167 --> 02:58:37.648]  This is the boss.
[02:58:37.648 --> 02:58:38.388]  TurboForce.
[02:58:38.388 --> 02:58:39.388]  Back in stock.
[02:58:39.388 --> 02:58:40.409]  Discounted.
[02:58:40.409 --> 02:58:42.150]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:43.010]  More power.
[02:58:43.010 --> 02:58:44.010]  More strength.
[02:58:44.010 --> 02:58:47.852]  More energy.
[02:58:47.852 --> 02:58:54.515]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:58:54.515 --> 02:58:56.456]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:58:56.456 --> 02:58:57.957]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[02:58:57.957 --> 02:59:00.758]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:59:00.758 --> 02:59:02.759]  And it says, political prisoner.
[02:59:03.539 --> 02:59:05.501]  With an image of President Trump.
[02:59:05.501 --> 02:59:07.943]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:59:07.943 --> 02:59:10.085]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:59:10.085 --> 02:59:11.666]  Political prisoner.
[02:59:11.666 --> 02:59:15.470]  With Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[02:59:15.470 --> 02:59:16.691]  Jail background.
[02:59:16.691 --> 02:59:17.732]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:59:17.732 --> 02:59:21.856]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:59:21.856 --> 02:59:23.477]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[02:59:23.477 --> 02:59:24.498]  No, I'm not running for President.
[02:59:24.498 --> 02:59:27.040]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:27.821]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:59:27.821 --> 02:59:28.702]  Alex Jones for President.
[02:59:29.382 --> 02:59:32.223]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[02:59:32.223 --> 02:59:34.104]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:59:34.104 --> 02:59:49.429]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:49.429 --> 02:59:55.331]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:00.384 --> 03:00:03.226]  All right, final segment before Drew Hernandez takes over.
[03:00:03.226 --> 03:00:03.906]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:03.906 --> 03:00:06.427]  Lipperdowski's here with WeAreChange.org.
[03:00:06.427 --> 03:00:07.028]  I got it right.
[03:00:07.028 --> 03:00:07.828]  My sheet said com.
[03:00:07.828 --> 03:00:08.909]  I thought it was like it's org.
[03:00:08.909 --> 03:00:09.769]  It's org.
[03:00:09.769 --> 03:00:12.070]  Not all as great work there as podcasts and shows.
[03:00:12.070 --> 03:00:13.331]  WeAreChange.org.
[03:00:13.331 --> 03:00:14.192]  Okay, so you were
[03:00:15.106 --> 03:00:20.531]  Making the point about, it's not about the churches, that's men in most cases trying to get in front of us and God.
[03:00:20.531 --> 03:00:23.133]  We know God's real, the priest class gets in front of it.
[03:00:23.133 --> 03:00:27.837]  There are some real priests, some real leaders that can help us get to God, but in a lot of cases they've been bought off.
[03:00:27.837 --> 03:00:33.362]  They're controlled like this woman that's a preacher that's running around hiding the Bibles at the Arizona Capitol.
[03:00:33.362 --> 03:00:34.123]  That's how they took over.
[03:00:36.061 --> 03:00:36.781]  God's real.
[03:00:36.781 --> 03:00:38.462]  The universe that God controls is real.
[03:00:38.462 --> 03:00:39.963]  You've got to reach out, folks.
[03:00:39.963 --> 03:00:41.223]  The enemy doesn't want you to do that.
[03:00:41.223 --> 03:00:43.544]  There's Paul Watson's latest headline on InfoWars.
[03:00:43.544 --> 03:00:46.266]  Believe in higher power surges amongst American youth.
[03:00:46.266 --> 03:00:46.906]  It's happening.
[03:00:46.906 --> 03:00:49.267]  The new renaissance, the new great awakening is here.
[03:00:49.267 --> 03:00:57.371]  Closing comments on that and how we come together, create love and counter their resonance with love, with power, with justice, with courage.
[03:00:58.177 --> 03:01:00.498]  Well, decentralization is the answer.
[03:01:00.498 --> 03:01:01.178]  It's the key.
[03:01:01.178 --> 03:01:09.100]  Taking personal responsibility, being happy and healthy is an act of resistance in our modern-day society, as of course a lot of people are under attack.
[03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:13.682]  And, you know, it's fun, it's easy to make fun of these people, but we need empathy, and we need to call out the bullcrap
[03:01:14.082 --> 03:01:16.564]  On all the sites, including even some of the churches.
[03:01:16.564 --> 03:01:22.127]  There's a lot of horrible child molesters inside of major churches that also need to be called out as well.
[03:01:22.127 --> 03:01:24.969]  So there's a lot of monsters all over the place.
[03:01:24.969 --> 03:01:26.250]  Be an individual.
[03:01:26.250 --> 03:01:27.851]  Question everything yourselves.
[03:01:27.851 --> 03:01:43.361]  But right now, during this key moment in time, we need to start those conversations because they are deathly afraid of you speaking truth, of you finding out exactly what's going on, of you doing your own homework, your own research, and then making decisions for yourself that don't incentivize the beast.
[03:01:43.741 --> 03:01:54.566]  The monster, you not giving your dollars, your money, your time and energy into all these negative realms and all these negative, horrible creatures and entities out there.
[03:01:54.566 --> 03:01:59.889]  And whether it's the latest, you know, movie or TV series or Netflix, whatever it is, you have a choice.
[03:02:00.409 --> 03:02:15.918]  You could do that, or you could spend your time and energy trying to, of course, develop and grow and support independent media that's been standing with the people, calling out their bullcrap, and trying to save people from the larger weaponization of information that has been happening in this country.
[03:02:15.918 --> 03:02:23.142]  And, you know, Alex, you know, we had our problems, we had our differences, but I think we need to set those aside more than ever because we're in deep trouble if we don't.
[03:02:23.462 --> 03:02:24.743]  We're in a bad situation.
[03:02:24.743 --> 03:02:26.343]  It's going to get worse from here.
[03:02:26.343 --> 03:02:32.306]  And with those situations, you could either become the strongest version of yourself or you could be destroyed by those situations.
[03:02:32.306 --> 03:02:35.608]  But unless we come together, we're going to be taken out individually.
[03:02:35.608 --> 03:02:40.290]  And this is why it's so important, more than ever, to come together, build communities.
[03:02:40.290 --> 03:02:42.651]  I'm doing that right now in Miami, Florida.
[03:02:42.651 --> 03:02:45.893]  I'm going to be doing an in real life meetup in Florida.
[03:02:45.893 --> 03:02:50.175]  For information about that, you could go to LukeUnfiltered.com for members of
[03:02:50.555 --> 03:02:53.017]  I don't want to have any real community, just the fake digital community.
[03:02:53.017 --> 03:02:54.138]  So let me ask you this, in closing,
[03:03:15.407 --> 03:03:16.850]  I believe humanity is winning right now.
[03:03:16.850 --> 03:03:18.554]  I believe the globalists are desperate.
[03:03:18.554 --> 03:03:20.118]  I believe they're scared.
[03:03:20.118 --> 03:03:20.719]  I don't believe.
[03:03:20.719 --> 03:03:21.440]  I know they're losing.
[03:03:23.797 --> 03:03:25.559]  I agree with you in some elements.
[03:03:25.559 --> 03:03:28.781]  I do believe it's going to get a little worse before it gets any kind of better.
[03:03:28.781 --> 03:03:36.827]  But with that, you have an opportunity to challenge yourself, to test yourself, and to use those challenges as a way to persevere and be strong.
[03:03:36.827 --> 03:03:41.670]  So, when looking at the problems ahead, don't look for anyone to solve them for you.
[03:03:41.670 --> 03:03:42.091]  Be ready.
[03:03:42.091 --> 03:03:42.391]  Be smart.
[03:03:42.391 --> 03:03:45.593]  You don't walk into the gym and see a bunch of weights and say, oh my gosh, I'm scared.
[03:03:45.593 --> 03:03:46.694]  Those weights are going to make you stronger.
[03:03:47.748 --> 03:03:48.228]  Exactly.
[03:03:48.228 --> 03:03:49.309]  You want that adversity.
[03:03:49.309 --> 03:03:50.870]  You want that challenge.
[03:03:50.870 --> 03:03:59.714]  And I think we're all being challenged right now more than ever, especially when it comes to the financial situation in the United States, especially when it comes to the health situation inside of the United States.
[03:03:59.714 --> 03:04:03.656]  So take control of your health, take control of your life, take control of your finances.
[03:04:03.656 --> 03:04:08.038]  This is what I've been focusing on and working on specifically with LukeUnfiltered.com.
[03:04:08.038 --> 03:04:16.041]  And I think the more we do that, the more we understand the power that we have as individuals, the less we give it out to other individuals, the better we will be.
[03:04:16.041 --> 03:04:16.842]  Time to come together.
[03:04:17.182 --> 03:04:18.923]  Time is now more than ever.
[03:04:18.923 --> 03:04:20.283]  Luke, join us again soon.
[03:04:20.283 --> 03:04:22.124]  LukeUnfiltered.com.
[03:04:22.124 --> 03:04:24.104]  God bless you, and we love you, brother.
[03:04:24.104 --> 03:04:24.584]  Thank you, man.
[03:04:24.584 --> 03:04:27.525]  Thanks for having me, and it's been a long time, so it's good to be back.
[03:04:27.525 --> 03:04:28.626]  It's good to have you here.
[03:04:28.626 --> 03:04:29.706]  We never really had a fight.
[03:04:29.706 --> 03:04:34.948]  Like 10 years ago, a little bit of arguing about some media stuff, and then 10 years goes by like 10 seconds.
[03:04:34.948 --> 03:04:35.428]  I know.
[03:04:35.428 --> 03:04:41.490]  And then we're going to be 10 years from now, 20 years from now, hopefully 30 years from now, and I don't see much changing.
[03:04:42.133 --> 03:04:42.613]  Love you, brother.
[03:04:42.613 --> 03:04:46.495]  All right, the great Drew Hernandez takes over now.
[03:04:46.495 --> 03:04:53.977]  Then, in 55 minutes, Owen, the cup destroyer, takes over from the M4 War Studios in Austin, Texas.
[03:04:53.977 --> 03:04:54.718]  Please share the links.
[03:04:54.718 --> 03:04:55.358]  You are the resistance.
[03:04:57.637 --> 03:05:05.084]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:05:05.084 --> 03:05:07.887]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:05:07.887 --> 03:05:16.256]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:05:16.256 --> 03:05:18.318]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:05:18.658 --> 03:05:24.543]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:05:24.543 --> 03:05:32.969]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:05:32.969 --> 03:05:34.811]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[03:05:34.811 --> 03:05:41.436]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:05:41.896 --> 03:05:47.083]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:05:47.083 --> 03:05:53.212]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[03:05:53.212 --> 03:05:55.575]  Available now at InfoWareStore.com
[03:06:03.049 --> 03:06:12.353]  You gotta ask yourself, why are large portions of the population of the youth waking up to the reality of a higher power?
[03:06:12.353 --> 03:06:15.355]  That there's something out there greater than themselves?
[03:06:15.355 --> 03:06:18.976]  That there's someone out there greater than themselves?
[03:06:18.976 --> 03:06:21.898]  And that goes both ways, good and evil.
[03:06:21.898 --> 03:06:26.480]  God is greater than anything, anyone, whatever you could think of in your mind.
[03:06:27.415 --> 03:06:31.719]  Jesus Christ is more powerful, Alpha, Omega, Beginning, and the End.
[03:06:31.719 --> 03:06:33.901]  He was here yesterday, today, and forevermore.
[03:06:33.901 --> 03:06:36.823]  He's there!
[03:06:36.823 --> 03:06:38.785]  And you gotta ask yourself, what's the other side of that?
[03:06:38.785 --> 03:06:45.731]  The other side of that is, Lucifer and the Devil is 100% real as well.
[03:06:45.731 --> 03:06:47.012]  How do we know that?
[03:06:47.012 --> 03:06:48.973]  The Bible authenticates it.
[03:06:48.973 --> 03:06:51.255]  The occult authenticates it.
[03:06:51.255 --> 03:06:52.937]  Luciferians authenticate it.
[03:06:53.658 --> 03:06:59.080]  They all worship Lucifer himself with open opposition towards God, the God of the Bible.
[03:06:59.080 --> 03:07:01.761]  They never want to be around the name Jesus Christ.
[03:07:01.761 --> 03:07:07.082]  They could never sit around and accept the fact that someone is worshipping Jesus Christ.
[03:07:07.082 --> 03:07:18.886]  You say that name around a Luciferian, or someone that's demon possessed, or that is totally in opposition towards God, which by default all fawn mankind is, the sons in disobedience,
[03:07:19.676 --> 03:07:21.818]  But you gotta ask yourself, what is the equation?
[03:07:21.818 --> 03:07:25.081]  What is the intergalactic equation here?
[03:07:25.081 --> 03:07:28.904]  What is the equation of the universe when you ask yourself?
[03:07:28.904 --> 03:07:34.549]  Very basically, 5 plus 5 is 10, depending on who you ask.
[03:07:34.549 --> 03:07:43.397]  If you ask someone from the New World Order, the Deep State, someone from the realms of 1984 and that timeline in the multiverse, they'll tell you that 5 plus 5 equals 11, right?
[03:07:46.235 --> 03:08:07.693]  But in a normal world where things are done accurately and truth is told and things are concluded according to truth and reality is actually corresponding with what reality truly is, what is the intergalactic conclusion and calculation when you allow, alright, when you allow evil, and I'm talking pure evil,
[03:08:09.369 --> 03:08:16.934]  Luciferian, occult, pedophiles, groomers out in the open, murdering children.
[03:08:16.934 --> 03:08:19.956]  What do you think is the calculation?
[03:08:19.956 --> 03:08:33.125]  What is going to be the end result to what people will calculate when all of evil is allowed to just be absolutely unleashed and let loose in their society?
[03:08:33.125 --> 03:08:36.848]  Whether it's in the United States of America, whether it's in Europe,
[03:08:37.765 --> 03:08:42.709]  Whether it's in different parts of the world, East, West, you name it.
[03:08:42.709 --> 03:08:52.336]  When people clearly begin to identify that, hey, there is something evil out there that is controlling things behind the scenes.
[03:08:52.336 --> 03:09:00.942]  There are people that are puppets, that are agents of a system that seems to be in unison all together at once.
[03:09:00.942 --> 03:09:01.863]  Same message.
[03:09:01.863 --> 03:09:05.085]  You know, we call them NPCs right now, right?
[03:09:05.771 --> 03:09:14.257]  We call them these, you know, these woke-tard robots, these individuals that just take the next update or download whatever the New World Order says to believe.
[03:09:14.257 --> 03:09:16.779]  I believe in the current thing!
[03:09:16.779 --> 03:09:18.580]  We got words for that.
[03:09:18.580 --> 03:09:27.587]  But at the end of the day, it's the ancient, the ancient but still relevant story of what the Bible has unveiled to humanity of good versus evil.
[03:09:28.641 --> 03:09:38.431]  We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against powers, principalities, spiritual hosts of wickedness that are extremely advanced, intelligent.
[03:09:38.431 --> 03:09:43.115]  These individuals have been around longer than you and I have.
[03:09:43.115 --> 03:09:44.597]  They're ancient.
[03:09:44.597 --> 03:09:45.778]  They've studied humanity.
[03:09:45.778 --> 03:09:46.919]  They've watched humanity.
[03:09:48.197 --> 03:09:56.300]  They know, according to generations, just exactly how to manipulate people at the right time, with the right things, with the right words.
[03:09:56.300 --> 03:09:59.521]  This is what Satan did to Jesus in the wilderness when he tried to tempt Him.
[03:09:59.521 --> 03:10:05.103]  Tempted Him with everything and even laced some scripture with it as well.
[03:10:05.103 --> 03:10:07.223]  That's what a wolf in sheep's clothing is.
[03:10:07.223 --> 03:10:08.244]  Drew, what are you talking about?
[03:10:08.244 --> 03:10:12.465]  What I'm talking about is the conclusion, the intergalactic conclusion,
[03:10:13.402 --> 03:10:30.611]  Alright, that we are experiencing this multi-dimensional universe that we all live in, when they begin to collide and people begin to get exposed to realities, or the reality, that the multi-dimension world exists.
[03:10:30.611 --> 03:10:34.913]  That demons, spiritual hosts of wickedness, are real.
[03:10:35.894 --> 03:10:50.943]  And they not only function behind the scene because we live in a multi-dimensional world and universe, you can't see them, but in some cases they manifest, and in some cases they oppress human beings, and in some cases they possess human beings.
[03:10:50.943 --> 03:10:52.124]  You don't believe me?
[03:10:52.124 --> 03:10:53.785]  Take a trip to Haiti, buddy.
[03:10:53.785 --> 03:11:00.289]  Go live in Haiti for about a month and come back and tell me that spiritual hosts of wickedness are not real, alright?
[03:11:01.081 --> 03:11:10.947]  I always challenge people out there that think what I'm saying is a load of garbage, but that's just a- that's one way to confirm the Bible to be authenticated when it talks about demons, okay?
[03:11:10.947 --> 03:11:15.931]  But also, people wake up to the reality when they begin to experience things like this.
[03:11:15.931 --> 03:11:30.300]  They wake up to the reality that evil is absolutely real when the Bible has prophesied thousands of years ago that there would be an established new world order, one world government, one world militarized system, one world economy,
[03:11:31.614 --> 03:11:46.842]  One world absolute dictatorial power with the advent of an antichrist false prophet all empowered by Lucifer, the Luciferian trinity, the ultimate showdown right before the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[03:11:46.842 --> 03:11:49.944]  How is it that all these things are beginning to develop?
[03:11:49.944 --> 03:11:52.165]  You got to sit there and ask yourself.
[03:11:52.165 --> 03:11:57.908]  Multiple writers in the biblical text that knew of this, that spoke of it,
[03:11:58.556 --> 03:12:11.948]  That in some cases spoke different languages, lived in different generational time periods in the timeline of humanity, but still, that biblical thread of Bible prophecy is weaved perfectly.
[03:12:11.948 --> 03:12:12.868]  How?
[03:12:12.868 --> 03:12:13.249]  How?
[03:12:13.249 --> 03:12:15.050]  What a conspiracy theory, right?
[03:12:15.050 --> 03:12:24.979]  You want to talk about a conspiracy theory, thinking that multiple writers, multiple books, different geographical locations, no internet, no radio,
[03:12:25.825 --> 03:12:47.832]  Just somehow all conspired and communicated to weave the perfect, okay, the perfect biblical prophetic scriptures, alright, that all point to Jesus Christ, his first advent, his second advent, and also the precursor to the second coming, which is the advent of the Antichrist.
[03:12:47.832 --> 03:12:49.593]  How is it, my friend?
[03:12:49.593 --> 03:12:52.994]  How is it that multiple writers that did not know each other
[03:12:53.985 --> 03:12:58.767]  Lived in different geographical locations, different generations.
[03:12:58.767 --> 03:13:02.188]  They all point to the end.
[03:13:02.188 --> 03:13:12.592]  And how is it that here we are in 2023, thousands of years after these texts have been pinned down, we are starting to see these things come to fruition?
[03:13:12.592 --> 03:13:12.872]  Why?
[03:13:12.872 --> 03:13:14.373]  Because it's a conspiracy theory?
[03:13:14.373 --> 03:13:16.634]  You want to talk about believing in a conspiracy theory?
[03:13:18.777 --> 03:13:23.079]  The biggest lie of all humanity, that's a pretty wild one, man.
[03:13:23.079 --> 03:13:24.299]  You want to sit here?
[03:13:24.299 --> 03:13:31.843]  That's a pretty wild one to think that humans were that advanced to set something like that all up together.
[03:13:31.843 --> 03:13:34.884]  No, no, no, no.
[03:13:34.884 --> 03:13:36.945]  The confirmation is that the Holy Spirit
[03:13:38.061 --> 03:13:40.762]  Has inspired the scriptures, Old and New Testament.
[03:13:40.762 --> 03:13:53.205]  That is why eschatology, which is Bible prophecy, things that were prophesied and came to fruition, to the T, and things that are yet to come to fruition, will come together to the T, according to the Bible.
[03:13:53.205 --> 03:13:58.866]  And you gotta ask yourself, there are things that the prophets foretold that ended up happening.
[03:13:58.866 --> 03:14:05.908]  Including things like Palm Sunday, the advent and first coming of Jesus Christ, which is a historical event.
[03:14:07.578 --> 03:14:09.139]  You can't deny that!
[03:14:09.139 --> 03:14:22.745]  And I always ask people this, how come in the first century church, after Christ was alive, was crucified, was buried, and he rose from the dead and he ascended?
[03:14:22.745 --> 03:14:29.529]  Why is it in the first century it is very hard to find people trying to deny the existence of Jesus Christ?
[03:14:29.529 --> 03:14:29.709]  Why?
[03:14:30.413 --> 03:14:31.473]  Want to know why?
[03:14:31.473 --> 03:14:33.254]  Because it was impossible.
[03:14:33.254 --> 03:14:40.557]  It was impossible, especially in the regions of Israel, Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem at the time.
[03:14:40.557 --> 03:14:41.977]  The Romans could not deny.
[03:14:41.977 --> 03:14:45.719]  They just viewed Jesus Christ as a threat.
[03:14:45.719 --> 03:14:47.579]  It was just a ghost they were afraid of.
[03:14:47.579 --> 03:14:54.222]  They viewed Jesus Christ as an insurrectionist, a threat to the state, because he had a mass following publicly, thousands of people.
[03:14:54.222 --> 03:14:56.363]  You want to talk about followers?
[03:14:56.363 --> 03:14:56.663]  Alright?
[03:14:57.927 --> 03:15:04.811]  Imagine tens of thousands of people following you, walking around your city, because they believe in what you're saying.
[03:15:04.811 --> 03:15:08.453]  They've identified you as God, or they think there's something they can get out of you.
[03:15:08.453 --> 03:15:12.116]  The Romans saw that as an act of revolution against the state.
[03:15:12.116 --> 03:15:16.638]  Jesus Christ was the ultimate insurrectionist, according to the Romans.
[03:15:16.638 --> 03:15:17.639]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:15:17.639 --> 03:15:19.220]  What's the point, Drew?
[03:15:19.220 --> 03:15:25.764]  The point is, how can you deny that that did not exist, especially in the first century?
[03:15:26.830 --> 03:15:31.911]  No one tried to deny the existence of Jesus because he's real.
[03:15:31.911 --> 03:15:36.692]  He's 100% an authentic historical figure.
[03:15:36.692 --> 03:15:38.333]  And no one tried to deny his existence.
[03:15:38.333 --> 03:15:44.774]  In the first century, a lot of people were trying to disclaim or slander Christ and his works and his miracles.
[03:15:44.774 --> 03:15:48.735]  They said he was a magician practicing dark magic and he shouldn't be trusted.
[03:15:48.735 --> 03:15:51.416]  It was all optical illusions.
[03:15:51.416 --> 03:15:52.876]  There's a reason for that.
[03:15:52.876 --> 03:15:54.116]  You waking up now?
[03:15:54.116 --> 03:15:54.837]  Good.
[03:15:54.837 --> 03:15:56.097]  We have a lot more when we come back from the break.
[03:15:57.526 --> 03:16:01.588]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:16:01.588 --> 03:16:05.430]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:16:05.430 --> 03:16:07.811]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:16:07.811 --> 03:16:10.673]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:16:10.673 --> 03:16:12.714]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:16:13.534 --> 03:16:17.998]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[03:16:17.998 --> 03:16:21.400]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:25.443]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:16:25.443 --> 03:16:28.045]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[03:16:28.045 --> 03:16:29.106]  It just can't end.
[03:16:33.329 --> 03:16:35.471]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:16:35.471 --> 03:16:37.093]  They are nothing but distractions.
[03:16:37.093 --> 03:16:39.316]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[03:16:39.316 --> 03:16:41.778]  You silenced those voices.
[03:16:41.778 --> 03:16:45.422]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:16:45.422 --> 03:16:51.970]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!

[03:18:46.149 --> 03:18:47.451]  So get off the bench.

[03:18:57.233 --> 03:19:02.936]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[03:19:02.936 --> 03:19:05.617]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[03:19:05.617 --> 03:19:08.239]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[03:19:08.239 --> 03:19:08.979]  Period.
[03:19:08.979 --> 03:19:10.080]  Case closed.
[03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:11.441]  Out to get you and your family.
[03:19:11.441 --> 03:19:11.921]  We sell.
[03:19:12.441 --> 03:19:19.729]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:19:19.729 --> 03:19:27.277]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[03:19:28.098 --> 03:19:32.482]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:19:32.482 --> 03:19:34.003]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:19:34.003 --> 03:19:36.805]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:19:36.805 --> 03:19:42.049]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[03:19:42.049 --> 03:19:47.513]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:19:47.513 --> 03:19:49.155]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:19:49.155 --> 03:19:50.596]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:19:50.596 --> 03:19:52.297]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:19:52.297 --> 03:19:54.859]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarshore.com.
[03:19:54.859 --> 03:19:56.060]  They're discounted right now.
[03:19:56.060 --> 03:19:56.781]  Finally back in stock.
[03:19:57.822 --> 03:20:02.423]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:02.423 --> 03:20:11.606]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:11.606 --> 03:20:16.007]  You know, Luke Rudowsky said it best at the end of the third hour.
[03:20:16.007 --> 03:20:19.948]  You know, seek the truth for yourself.
[03:20:19.948 --> 03:20:22.809]  Find these things out to be true on your own.
[03:20:23.934 --> 03:20:26.056]  No one can find it for you.
[03:20:26.056 --> 03:20:28.078]  No one can do it for you.
[03:20:28.078 --> 03:20:35.585]  No one can think for you, because once you allow people to think for you, that's when the New World Order steps in and says, well, here's the next algorithm.
[03:20:35.585 --> 03:20:36.746]  You want VR?
[03:20:36.746 --> 03:20:37.887]  You want AR?
[03:20:37.887 --> 03:20:44.352]  You want this new microchip in your brain so we could just download whatever it is we can think up for you?
[03:20:44.352 --> 03:20:47.235]  Because we're the fact checkers.
[03:20:47.235 --> 03:20:49.157]  We're the ones who have the accurate truth.
[03:20:50.197 --> 03:20:51.397]  You can't do it on your own.
[03:20:51.397 --> 03:20:54.659]  We are the AI technocratic gods.
[03:20:54.659 --> 03:20:56.219]  That's what these people believe they are.
[03:20:56.219 --> 03:20:59.580]  You know, people ask, how do I find faith?
[03:20:59.580 --> 03:21:00.761]  How do I find this?
[03:21:00.761 --> 03:21:03.581]  How do I obtain what you're talking about?
[03:21:03.581 --> 03:21:06.642]  You know, that is the beginning.
[03:21:06.642 --> 03:21:09.944]  Everyone is given a measure of faith according to the Bible.
[03:21:09.944 --> 03:21:17.006]  That desire is inside of you because God put that desire for the hunger and the thirst and
[03:21:18.169 --> 03:21:20.811]  The search for truth within you?
[03:21:20.811 --> 03:21:22.713]  Where do you think that comes from?
[03:21:22.713 --> 03:21:27.096]  You know what I'm here to tell you, I'm just the messenger man.
[03:21:27.096 --> 03:21:29.979]  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.
[03:21:29.979 --> 03:21:32.721]  Go spend some time in the scriptures.
[03:21:32.721 --> 03:21:37.865]  And listen, if you're ADD like me, you gotta ask God, please help me to focus.
[03:21:37.865 --> 03:21:38.306]  And He will.
[03:21:39.580 --> 03:21:52.368]  And you'll see very true, you'll find yourselves obsessed of communing with God and reading the God-breath scriptures, not to be religious and holier-than-thou, but the reality of how true this really is!
[03:21:52.368 --> 03:21:58.592]  You know, that's why we have an entire generation of people waking up to the reality of a higher power.
[03:21:58.592 --> 03:22:01.994]  You know, you got to define what that means.
[03:22:01.994 --> 03:22:08.338]  Because I'll tell you one thing, people are waking up to the reality that Lucifer is real, and they want to choose his side.
[03:22:10.060 --> 03:22:12.160]  Look around you, look at the culture!
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:25.183]  People are waking up to the reality that He will take you to the pinnacle of the mountain and give you everything that you want and desire, all power, all money, all clout, you name it, if you just get on your knees and worship Him.
[03:22:25.183 --> 03:22:25.983]  How do you worship Him?
[03:22:25.983 --> 03:22:27.923]  You deny Christ.
[03:22:27.923 --> 03:22:32.524]  You deny everything that has to do with Jesus, reality.
[03:22:32.524 --> 03:22:35.985]  You bow down to degeneracy, immorality, and the New World Order.
[03:22:37.890 --> 03:22:40.452]  You're a Luciferian, by default.
[03:22:40.452 --> 03:22:44.094]  You're pledging your allegiance to Satan.
[03:22:44.094 --> 03:22:50.679]  And I want to encourage people, on the flip side, people are waking up to the reality of the spiritual reality of things.
[03:22:50.679 --> 03:22:59.445]  Because when you get exposed to evil, when you get exposed to pedophiles being normalized in society, maps, minor attracted persons, right?
[03:22:59.445 --> 03:23:00.566]  All this garbage.
[03:23:00.566 --> 03:23:01.947]  Youth attracted persons!
[03:23:03.092 --> 03:23:17.736]  When all this is getting normalized, and the so-called trans people that are not real, they're just homosexuals, start running around and murdering little Christian kids, and laughing about it, and the mainstream media turns around and defends the kids and the adults that were murdered.
[03:23:17.736 --> 03:23:29.959]  When the United States of America has been murdering and slaughtering babies in the womb and outside of the womb, offering them up to Molech, which is just another form of worship to the devil, a idol,
[03:23:31.278 --> 03:23:34.881]  Offering up blood, human sacrifice.
[03:23:34.881 --> 03:23:43.106]  When that's happening on a daily basis, you're gonna start to see some real serious demonic activity begin to pop out.
[03:23:43.106 --> 03:23:46.308]  And I don't say that like, yes, I was right!
[03:23:46.308 --> 03:23:54.894]  But I will say, yes, God is right and he warns every single one of us that we have the option to listen or we have the option to reject and not listen.
[03:23:56.320 --> 03:23:59.816]  And not apply anything, and then we get into situations like this.
[03:23:59.816 --> 03:24:01.463]  So I encourage people.
[03:24:02.521 --> 03:24:04.242]  Seek the truth for yourself.
[03:24:04.242 --> 03:24:06.382]  There's a reason why you've been selected.
[03:24:06.382 --> 03:24:10.483]  You are hand-selected for this generation, my friend.
[03:24:10.483 --> 03:24:11.524]  Look around you.
[03:24:11.524 --> 03:24:13.524]  Look at the advances of Satanism.
[03:24:13.524 --> 03:24:15.865]  Look at the advances of the World Economic Forum.
[03:24:15.865 --> 03:24:29.029]  Look at the advances of Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, these Satanists and Luciferians in the mainstream media, in the culture, with their lies and propaganda and their literal agendas to destroy the West.
[03:24:29.029 --> 03:24:32.010]  And anyone that loves God, this is all about God.
[03:24:32.816 --> 03:24:36.819]  People want to say the United States of America was founded with Christian values?
[03:24:36.819 --> 03:24:40.301]  Then what do you think this whole dismantling of the West is all about, you guys?
[03:24:40.301 --> 03:24:44.844]  You see, that's just the surface-level argument.
[03:24:44.844 --> 03:24:45.624]  This is about America.
[03:24:45.624 --> 03:24:48.146]  No, this is about good versus evil.
[03:24:48.146 --> 03:24:49.587]  And yes, America was founded.
[03:24:50.313 --> 03:24:55.376]  We have these values of Christianity and obviously they've been subverted and attacked.
[03:24:55.376 --> 03:25:09.465]  That is why it's more offensive for a little kid in kindergarten to be told thou shall not kill from the Ten Commandments, but it's not offensive, okay, at all, if you want to groom a child and get a pedophile in there and have drag queen pedo time with all the kindergartners.
[03:25:09.465 --> 03:25:11.006]  No, that's not offensive.
[03:25:11.006 --> 03:25:14.208]  Quoting thou shall not kill to a little kid is offensive.
[03:25:15.757 --> 03:25:22.079]  I'm so sick of people sitting here and saying, oh, oh, no, no, no, just, just, no, that's too much, that's too much, it's a, yeah, yeah.
[03:25:22.079 --> 03:25:41.784]  Keep saying that, and the pedophiles are saying, yeah, keep saying that, you cuckservative, keep saying that, you libtard moron, keep saying that, oh, yes, keep saying that, so we can advance, hijack your children, molest and rape your children, because that is how Satan is functioning.
[03:25:41.784 --> 03:25:43.585]  When good men and good women
[03:25:44.975 --> 03:25:50.977]  Are unwilling to say anything and do anything when it comes to dealing with some serious evil?
[03:25:50.977 --> 03:25:52.958]  Then there's only one result, my friend.
[03:25:52.958 --> 03:25:58.359]  Evil will advance and dominate that society.
[03:25:58.359 --> 03:26:01.601]  Absolutely dominate that society.
[03:26:01.601 --> 03:26:04.341]  The stuff with Tucker Carlson is insane, isn't it?
[03:26:04.341 --> 03:26:06.362]  Perfect example.
[03:26:06.362 --> 03:26:10.944]  I personally think the Deep State moved very strategically against Tucker.
[03:26:10.944 --> 03:26:12.044]  Tucker's gonna be alright.
[03:26:12.987 --> 03:26:14.048]  Tucker's a superstar.
[03:26:14.048 --> 03:26:18.371]  I would be here, I would not be here without Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones.
[03:26:18.371 --> 03:26:23.255]  There's a select handful of men that have allowed me to be in the position I am today.
[03:26:23.255 --> 03:26:25.977]  Tucker Carlson is definitely one of them.
[03:26:25.977 --> 03:26:29.420]  But you really think about the timeline, like really think about this.
[03:26:29.420 --> 03:26:32.722]  Kevin McCarthy says, we're gonna, we're gonna hand over, right?
[03:26:32.722 --> 03:26:37.106]  Rhino Kevin McCarthy comes out and says, we're gonna hand over the J6 tapes to who?
[03:26:37.106 --> 03:26:41.149]  To Fox News and Tucker Carlson.
[03:26:41.149 --> 03:26:42.550]  And immediately it was like,
[03:26:43.744 --> 03:26:45.345]  Open game!
[03:26:45.345 --> 03:26:49.508]  The entire Deep State on both sides, the unit party, they all went after Tucker.
[03:26:49.508 --> 03:26:56.813]  Fox, Chuck Schumer came out and went after Murdoch, went after everyone at Fox at the top and said, you need to de-platform him.
[03:26:56.813 --> 03:26:58.374]  Fox needs to take care of this.
[03:26:58.374 --> 03:27:01.196]  There's no way you can allow Tucker Carlson to put out these exposés.
[03:27:02.660 --> 03:27:04.481]  AOC came out and said what?
[03:27:04.481 --> 03:27:11.004]  We need federal intervention when it comes to Tucker and his incitement of violence.
[03:27:11.004 --> 03:27:13.205]  All because of the J6 expose.
[03:27:13.205 --> 03:27:19.708]  Exposing Ray Epps, exposing the J6 committee and their so-called narrative shattered it.
[03:27:19.708 --> 03:27:23.390]  I personally wanted the J6 tapes to be leaked like a WikiLeaks style.
[03:27:23.390 --> 03:27:25.011]  I think a lot of you guys agree with that.
[03:27:25.011 --> 03:27:26.772]  But Tucker only had an hour.
[03:27:26.772 --> 03:27:29.533]  Can only really do so much in an hour when it comes to exposing something like that.
[03:27:31.021 --> 03:27:32.401]  But isn't it interesting?
[03:27:32.401 --> 03:27:33.081]  I don't know, man.
[03:27:33.081 --> 03:27:36.642]  I don't believe in the two-party system.
[03:27:36.642 --> 03:27:38.343]  I think it's a mirage.
[03:27:38.343 --> 03:27:42.064]  I think it's to get us thinking only one way.
[03:27:42.064 --> 03:27:49.225]  And it's the perfect way for subverters in wolves-in-sheep's clothing to get you to think that they're on your side, isn't it?
[03:27:49.225 --> 03:27:51.206]  You gotta discern people's behavior.
[03:27:51.206 --> 03:27:54.426]  You shall know a tree by their fruit, my friend.
[03:27:54.426 --> 03:27:55.827]  Not by their jersey.
[03:27:55.827 --> 03:27:57.147]  Not by their robe.
[03:27:57.147 --> 03:27:58.267]  Not by their title.
[03:27:58.267 --> 03:28:00.388]  Not even by the words that come out of their mouths.
[03:28:01.184 --> 03:28:06.929]  You shall know them by their fruit, their behaviors, what they support, what they have been supporting for years?
[03:28:06.929 --> 03:28:16.456]  Because I could say one thing and be living a totally different lifestyle and throwing my money into something that has nothing to do with what I just claimed I believe.
[03:28:16.456 --> 03:28:19.178]  I think Tucker was set up.
[03:28:19.178 --> 03:28:19.979]  This is my opinion.
[03:28:19.979 --> 03:28:27.905]  I think the RINOs knew that Tucker would take the J6 tapes and it was the perfect way.
[03:28:27.905 --> 03:28:28.766]  It was the perfect way.
[03:28:28.766 --> 03:28:30.207]  They handed it to him.
[03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:48.462]  He did the exposés like he should, but I think the deep state knew all along, left and right, that this would be the smoking gun, the silver bullet, to shoot in the back of Tucker Carlson's head, because he is the primetime host with millions.
[03:28:48.462 --> 03:28:50.684]  I got a lot more on this theory, this is just my opinion.
[03:28:50.684 --> 03:28:54.007]  When we come back from the break, I know it's getting juicy, so don't go anywhere, you guys.
[03:28:54.007 --> 03:28:54.627]  Share the links.
[03:28:54.627 --> 03:28:55.408]  We need you to do it now.
[03:28:58.277 --> 03:29:01.420]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:29:01.420 --> 03:29:03.722]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:29:03.722 --> 03:29:07.666]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:29:07.666 --> 03:29:15.753]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:29:15.753 --> 03:29:24.381]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:29:25.385 --> 03:29:29.028]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:29:29.028 --> 03:29:34.834]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:29:34.834 --> 03:29:37.296]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:29:37.296 --> 03:29:37.856]  Keep doing it.
[03:29:37.856 --> 03:29:44.923]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:29:44.923 --> 03:29:46.104]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:29:46.804 --> 03:29:51.106]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at MFORESTORE.com.
[03:29:51.106 --> 03:29:56.047]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to MFORESTORE.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:29:56.047 --> 03:29:57.028]  Please take action now.
[03:29:57.028 --> 03:30:02.750]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:05.431]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[03:30:05.431 --> 03:30:08.032]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[03:30:08.032 --> 03:30:08.792]  Period.
[03:30:08.792 --> 03:30:09.872]  Case closed.
[03:30:09.872 --> 03:30:11.253]  Out to get you and your family.
[03:30:11.253 --> 03:30:11.793]  We sell
[03:30:12.233 --> 03:30:19.522]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:30:19.522 --> 03:30:27.092]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[03:30:27.893 --> 03:30:32.274]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:30:32.274 --> 03:30:33.795]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:30:33.795 --> 03:30:36.616]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:30:36.616 --> 03:30:41.837]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[03:30:41.837 --> 03:30:47.299]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:30:47.299 --> 03:30:48.959]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:30:48.959 --> 03:30:50.540]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:30:50.540 --> 03:30:52.080]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:30:52.080 --> 03:30:54.641]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarshore.com.
[03:30:54.641 --> 03:30:55.842]  They're discounted right now.
[03:30:55.842 --> 03:30:56.582]  Finally back in stock.
[03:30:57.682 --> 03:31:09.648]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsaw.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[03:31:09.648 --> 03:31:13.991]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[03:31:14.571 --> 03:31:17.996]  Many of you, for years, have never gone to InfoWorksShore.com.
[03:31:17.996 --> 03:31:26.528]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWorksShore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[03:31:26.528 --> 03:31:29.873]  I'm sure you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:31:29.873 --> 03:31:30.815]  That's great and I thank you.
[03:31:31.215 --> 03:31:32.736]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:31:32.736 --> 03:31:41.098]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[03:31:41.098 --> 03:31:43.159]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[03:31:43.159 --> 03:31:44.059]  They keep us on air.
[03:31:44.059 --> 03:31:45.840]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:31:45.840 --> 03:31:47.140]  So get off the bench.
[03:31:47.140 --> 03:31:47.981]  Get in the game.
[03:31:47.981 --> 03:31:54.723]  Step to the plate and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:57.208 --> 03:32:03.211]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:32:03.211 --> 03:32:05.873]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:32:05.873 --> 03:32:08.054]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:32:08.054 --> 03:32:10.635]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:32:10.635 --> 03:32:13.857]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:32:13.857 --> 03:32:15.618]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[03:32:15.618 --> 03:32:22.241]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:32:22.241 --> 03:32:25.043]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:32:26.004 --> 03:32:28.105]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:32:28.105 --> 03:32:32.749]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:32:32.749 --> 03:32:36.471]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:32:36.471 --> 03:32:39.613]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[03:32:39.613 --> 03:32:42.175]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[03:32:42.175 --> 03:32:43.516]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:32:43.516 --> 03:32:49.300]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:49.300 --> 03:32:50.680]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:32:50.680 --> 03:32:51.981]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:51.981 --> 03:32:55.924]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:32:58.205 --> 03:33:12.811]  You know, it's as simple as this.
[03:33:12.811 --> 03:33:16.093]  This is how the Uniparty functions.
[03:33:16.093 --> 03:33:19.454]  Deep State says, how do we take down Tucker Carlson?
[03:33:19.454 --> 03:33:20.475]  Alright.
[03:33:20.475 --> 03:33:23.056]  Let's give him the J6 tapes.
[03:33:23.056 --> 03:33:24.256]  Fresh meat.
[03:33:24.256 --> 03:33:25.397]  Immediately, Chuck Schumer
[03:33:26.391 --> 03:33:30.813]  On the left, AOC on the left called for the takedown of Tucker Carlson.
[03:33:30.813 --> 03:33:32.334]  Went after Fox.
[03:33:32.334 --> 03:33:34.015]  Went after Rupert Murdoch.
[03:33:34.015 --> 03:33:35.656]  He bent the knee.
[03:33:35.656 --> 03:33:37.737]  Couple months later, here we are.
[03:33:37.737 --> 03:33:40.198]  Tucker Carlson is gone.
[03:33:40.198 --> 03:33:40.658]  Alright?
[03:33:40.658 --> 03:33:44.400]  Off of Fox News, but not gone entirely.
[03:33:44.400 --> 03:33:46.161]  That man posted that video last night.
[03:33:46.161 --> 03:33:47.962]  Did you guys notice?
[03:33:47.962 --> 03:33:49.783]  His video he posted on Twitter last night.
[03:33:49.783 --> 03:33:51.764]  It was at 8pm.
[03:33:51.764 --> 03:33:52.044]  Eastern.
[03:33:53.303 --> 03:33:54.724]  That's his prime time, man!
[03:33:54.724 --> 03:33:56.464]  So, you know, Tucker's not going anywhere, man.
[03:33:56.464 --> 03:34:00.806]  That guy has a lot, a lot coming, man.
[03:34:00.806 --> 03:34:01.546]  Everyone could see it.
[03:34:01.546 --> 03:34:02.266]  Everyone could feel it.
[03:34:02.266 --> 03:34:04.207]  I think it's going to be incredible.
[03:34:04.207 --> 03:34:08.409]  Because I like in the video how Tucker took shots at both sides.
[03:34:08.409 --> 03:34:09.329]  That's what we need right now.
[03:34:09.329 --> 03:34:11.070]  We need someone that is just coming out.
[03:34:11.070 --> 03:34:14.411]  I want to see a Tucker Carlson unleashed, right?
[03:34:14.411 --> 03:34:16.752]  But look how they took him down.
[03:34:16.752 --> 03:34:19.053]  And then look at the response, okay?
[03:34:19.053 --> 03:34:19.913]  You can always tell
[03:34:21.488 --> 03:34:24.591]  By their response, when they take their victory laps.
[03:34:24.591 --> 03:34:30.956]  Look at the victory laps that were taken when Alex Jones got deplatformed and InfoWars.
[03:34:30.956 --> 03:34:33.718]  The far left and the globalists all took their victory laps.
[03:34:33.718 --> 03:34:39.723]  They all started slandering all the guys, Alex, Owen, Harrison, you name it, everyone involved.
[03:34:39.723 --> 03:34:44.527]  Because once they censor you, you have no voice, you have no platform to come out and defend yourself.
[03:34:45.413 --> 03:34:49.716]  And then everyone on the so-called right that claims free speech, no one wanted to touch InfoWars.
[03:34:49.716 --> 03:34:50.836]  It was like they had leprosy.
[03:34:50.836 --> 03:34:52.838]  You guys remember that?
[03:34:52.838 --> 03:34:56.900]  Fast forward a few years later, everyone was trying to warn everyone else.
[03:34:56.900 --> 03:34:58.041]  You saw everyone getting banned.
[03:34:58.041 --> 03:35:01.022]  Laura Loomer, Gavin McInnes, you name it, okay?
[03:35:01.022 --> 03:35:03.624]  Everyone was getting hit out there on big tech.
[03:35:03.624 --> 03:35:05.605]  And the writing was on the wall.
[03:35:05.605 --> 03:35:08.547]  President Donald J. Trump, he didn't want to listen.
[03:35:08.547 --> 03:35:13.090]  He got banned off of Twitter and Facebook and you name it, right?
[03:35:13.090 --> 03:35:14.551]  No one is untouchable unless
[03:35:15.845 --> 03:35:22.288]  You are an agent of Lucifer, and you're useful for the moment, and then even when he's done with you, they throw you overboard.
[03:35:22.288 --> 03:35:24.309]  Look what they did to Don Lemon!
[03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:29.552]  The guy that says, uh, all white people are bad, but is at home sleeping with a white guy every single night.
[03:35:29.552 --> 03:35:31.313]  Because, uh, yeah!
[03:35:31.313 --> 03:35:32.013]  Sodomy!
[03:35:32.013 --> 03:35:37.456]  Oh, gosh.
[03:35:37.456 --> 03:35:41.418]  Anyways, the point is, this is how the Deep State functions.
[03:35:42.509 --> 03:35:59.121]  They take down Tucker and you look at the celebrations, the Pentagon, the Pentagon, you guys, the Pentagon is coming out and showing their appreciation and how they, they approve the takedown of Tucker Carlson out of Fox News.
[03:35:59.121 --> 03:35:59.802]  Why?
[03:35:59.802 --> 03:36:05.346]  Because Tucker was too mean and he called out our great military for being too woke.
[03:36:07.165 --> 03:36:13.730]  Well, you got the mil- you got the United States Army pushing all this CRT, inclusive diversity garbage.
[03:36:13.730 --> 03:36:15.271]  You could be a drag queen.
[03:36:15.271 --> 03:36:19.274]  Oh, you could just be totally, like, get sodomized in the military, and that's awesome!
[03:36:19.274 --> 03:36:19.915]  Yeah!
[03:36:19.915 --> 03:36:22.377]  That's what matters!
[03:36:22.377 --> 03:36:25.299]  As if, like, you go to war, and shout out to all the veterans, man.
[03:36:25.299 --> 03:36:26.440]  As if, like, you go to war...
[03:36:27.361 --> 03:36:33.524]  You know, on the other side of the globe, or here foreign, on foreign land, if we had to defend, right?
[03:36:33.524 --> 03:36:38.967]  As if what matters to your enemy is whether, like, you know, you're down with sodomy or not.
[03:36:38.967 --> 03:36:46.391]  Whether you're inclusive or tolerant, you know, to the trans mentally ill that belong in the asylums.
[03:36:46.391 --> 03:36:50.313]  As if they care whether you're inclusive to, like, who they are.
[03:36:50.313 --> 03:36:51.034]  Are you being nice?
[03:36:51.414 --> 03:36:52.355]  You being nice?
[03:36:52.355 --> 03:36:53.696]  Oh, are you okay?
[03:36:53.696 --> 03:36:55.937]  Did I shoot you too hard?
[03:36:55.937 --> 03:36:56.858]  Oh, no, no, no.
[03:36:56.858 --> 03:36:59.519]  You could shoot me, but just don't offend me.
[03:36:59.519 --> 03:37:01.220]  You could shoot me!
[03:37:01.220 --> 03:37:02.361]  This is a war!
[03:37:02.361 --> 03:37:13.008]  You could shoot me, but just don't offend me with your words, because your words are so much more powerful than an actual bullet in my head during a war!
[03:37:13.008 --> 03:37:14.009]  It makes no sense!
[03:37:15.006 --> 03:37:21.088]  And of course the Pentagon is going to come out and say something like that, because the deep state has infiltrated everything.
[03:37:21.088 --> 03:37:31.413]  You name it, the Pentagon, the Marines, the United States military, the Army, the CIA, the FBI, obviously politics, the Republican Party, the Democrat Party, you name it.
[03:37:31.413 --> 03:37:35.854]  These proxies and agents are in everything.
[03:37:35.854 --> 03:37:40.756]  Education, science, so-called health.
[03:37:40.756 --> 03:37:41.797]  You name it.
[03:37:41.797 --> 03:37:43.557]  These people are there.
[03:37:43.557 --> 03:37:44.498]  But there's a consequence.
[03:37:46.502 --> 03:37:47.963]  Remember, uh, remember Darcy?
[03:37:47.963 --> 03:37:49.304]  CNN's Darcy?
[03:37:49.304 --> 03:37:55.048]  Guy that's like so totally afraid and cucked out whenever, like, Alex Jones is around?
[03:37:55.048 --> 03:37:58.010]  Well, he actually said something, uh, pretty, uh, pretty interesting for once.
[03:37:58.010 --> 03:38:05.555]  Fox News viewership is collapsing among 25 and 54 year old age demographics after Tucker Carlson's firing.
[03:38:05.555 --> 03:38:06.376]  This is Breitbart.
[03:38:06.376 --> 03:38:08.357]  Well, yeah, of course.
[03:38:08.357 --> 03:38:11.219]  What'd I just get done saying in the past two or three segments?
[03:38:11.920 --> 03:38:18.661]  People are starting to wake up to these evil powers that are in existence, and they're fed up!
[03:38:18.661 --> 03:38:19.981]  Fox!
[03:38:19.981 --> 03:38:24.862]  This is probably, arguably, one of their biggest mistakes that they've ever made.
[03:38:24.862 --> 03:38:25.602]  Why?
[03:38:25.602 --> 03:38:27.343]  Because they're not of us.
[03:38:27.343 --> 03:38:28.583]  That's why.
[03:38:28.583 --> 03:38:30.463]  They want to be a part of the New World Order.
[03:38:30.463 --> 03:38:32.484]  They want to take their orders from the Deep State.
[03:38:32.484 --> 03:38:34.264]  They don't want to oppose Chuck Schumer.
[03:38:34.264 --> 03:38:36.244]  They don't want to oppose Nancy Pelosi.
[03:38:36.244 --> 03:38:40.565]  They don't want to oppose the Deep State New World Order that is on the hill in Washington.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:44.581]  Why do you think, look at AOC's response!
[03:38:44.581 --> 03:38:53.005]  Literally took to Instagram, took to Instagram to tell all her followers that de-platforming works and it's important.
[03:38:53.005 --> 03:38:58.567]  That's a direct quote from a so-called United States Congresswoman, alright?
[03:38:58.567 --> 03:39:02.749]  That is obviously a self-proclaimed socialist that has lost her mind.
[03:39:02.749 --> 03:39:07.991]  AOC is so like, it's just, she's very powerful.
[03:39:08.584 --> 03:39:18.111]  Because on one end, like, you could roast her, but she's also powerful because her following just believes everything she says!
[03:39:18.111 --> 03:39:24.515]  Yeah, she's a total woke-tard and a moron, doesn't correspond with reality, but those are the types of people the New World Order needs!
[03:39:24.515 --> 03:39:29.919]  Because they influence the millions of other woke-tard, mindless losers and NPCs!
[03:39:29.919 --> 03:39:32.180]  That's what a useful idiot is!
[03:39:32.180 --> 03:39:37.624]  But of course, of course AOC's gonna come out and literally celebrate the fact
[03:39:38.536 --> 03:39:42.177]  That Tucker Carlson just got taken down because she was calling for it!
[03:39:42.177 --> 03:39:43.798]  Oh, and then she came out and said, what did she say?
[03:39:43.798 --> 03:39:47.739]  She said, oh, because the majority of my death threats came from that man.
[03:39:47.739 --> 03:39:48.859]  The majority of those deaths.
[03:39:48.859 --> 03:39:51.860]  It's like, dude, you are a public figure, a U.S.
[03:39:51.860 --> 03:39:53.941]  politician that's installed.
[03:39:53.941 --> 03:39:57.242]  People are going to hate you, all right?
[03:39:57.242 --> 03:39:59.543]  But they can't handle it.
[03:39:59.543 --> 03:40:00.523]  They can't handle it at all.
[03:40:00.523 --> 03:40:03.404]  I mean, really think about it.
[03:40:05.041 --> 03:40:07.363]  The timing was perfect.
[03:40:07.363 --> 03:40:12.705]  And I don't say that like I support it, but it makes sense to me when you connect all the dots.
[03:40:12.705 --> 03:40:14.166]  You look at it all.
[03:40:14.166 --> 03:40:17.048]  Right in front of you, big screen right in front of you.
[03:40:17.048 --> 03:40:26.112]  Like you're in the command center in Star Wars and you're seeing everything right in front of you and you're seeing everything come together and how the new... Listen, the New World Order is very organized.
[03:40:26.112 --> 03:40:27.913]  They move very strategically.
[03:40:27.913 --> 03:40:28.914]  They do play chess.
[03:40:30.501 --> 03:40:42.368]  They don't, listen, they don't sit there and do things without strategically thinking about what is it that they want to accomplish through this action because there's a goal and an endgame to all of it.
[03:40:42.368 --> 03:40:43.769]  What do you think endgame is?
[03:40:43.769 --> 03:40:45.570]  All right?
[03:40:45.570 --> 03:40:48.672]  With Alex Jones's documentary, what do you think that whole thing is about?
[03:40:48.672 --> 03:40:50.994]  The endgame is for a specific reason.
[03:40:52.378 --> 03:41:06.750]  And there are different checkpoints, different goals throughout all human history where the devil is inserting and removing different proxies and agents that belong to him in order to push this anti-Christ agenda forward entirely.
[03:41:06.750 --> 03:41:12.475]  And you know, one of Tucker Carlson's so-called producers is suing him for sexism.
[03:41:14.355 --> 03:41:15.736]  Did you guys see that video?
[03:41:15.736 --> 03:41:20.697]  Oh, his producer, Justin Wells, him and Tucker, they ruined my life!
[03:41:20.697 --> 03:41:21.858]  They ruined me!
[03:41:21.858 --> 03:41:23.338]  They ruined me!
[03:41:23.338 --> 03:41:24.799]  Just this, like, cucked out woman.
[03:41:24.799 --> 03:41:26.579]  It's like, what's wrong with you?
[03:41:26.579 --> 03:41:31.841]  Like, for real, what is wrong with- Oh, Justin Wells and Tucker Carlson ruined me!
[03:41:31.841 --> 03:41:33.522]  They're misogynistic!
[03:41:33.522 --> 03:41:35.002]  They're sexists!
[03:41:35.002 --> 03:41:36.262]  Oh, and they're anti-Semitic!
[03:41:36.262 --> 03:41:38.363]  It's always those three, right?
[03:41:38.363 --> 03:41:39.403]  It's always those three.
[03:41:39.403 --> 03:41:43.545]  You're misogynistic and sexist and anti-Semitic!
[03:41:44.414 --> 03:41:45.816]  Because I'm a cucked out woman.
[03:41:45.816 --> 03:41:48.499]  It's like, dude, why did you get into politics?
[03:41:48.499 --> 03:41:49.601]  Why?
[03:41:49.601 --> 03:41:53.586]  If you don't have thick skin, what are you doing getting into politics?
[03:41:53.586 --> 03:41:55.669]  What are you doing?
[03:41:55.669 --> 03:41:59.073]  The world of politics is not for cucks in safe spaces.
[03:42:00.197 --> 03:42:00.898]  Alright?
[03:42:00.898 --> 03:42:03.720]  When you're dealing with evil demonic powers?
[03:42:03.720 --> 03:42:06.482]  When you're dealing with aggressive personalities?
[03:42:06.482 --> 03:42:15.010]  When you're dealing with people that are quite literally narcissistic psychopaths that want nothing but power and fame and glory?
[03:42:16.354 --> 03:42:17.676]  Come on, dude!
[03:42:17.676 --> 03:42:19.137]  This ain't for you, obviously!
[03:42:19.137 --> 03:42:23.502]  Go back to Chuck E. Cheese!
[03:42:23.502 --> 03:42:25.384]  Go back to Chuck E. Cheese, you loser!
[03:42:25.384 --> 03:42:33.093]  Or, I don't know, maybe just go to one of them gay bars, where all the woke white women are taking their babies, you know?
[03:42:33.093 --> 03:42:36.777]  They're taking their babies and bouncing them at the drag queen pedo times!
[03:42:37.057 --> 03:42:45.607]  With all the babies there, with a bunch of mentally ill homosexuals claiming to be trans, just helicoptering their genitals over and over and over again.
[03:42:45.607 --> 03:42:47.490]  Yeah, that's where you belong!
[03:42:47.490 --> 03:42:48.090]  Alright?
[03:42:48.090 --> 03:42:51.134]  That's where you belong, because you tolerate the pedophiles.
[03:42:51.134 --> 03:42:54.999]  Oh, but Tucker Carlson and Justin Wells, they hurt my feelings!
[03:42:57.395 --> 03:43:03.379]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:43:03.379 --> 03:43:06.041]  People said, no way, he's the most popular thing that ever happened.
[03:43:06.041 --> 03:43:08.222]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:43:08.222 --> 03:43:10.804]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:43:10.804 --> 03:43:14.026]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:43:14.026 --> 03:43:15.787]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[03:43:15.787 --> 03:43:22.432]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:43:22.432 --> 03:43:25.214]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:43:26.175 --> 03:43:28.276]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:43:28.276 --> 03:43:32.920]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:36.642]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:43:36.642 --> 03:43:39.784]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[03:43:39.784 --> 03:43:42.326]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[03:43:42.326 --> 03:43:43.687]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:43:43.687 --> 03:43:49.471]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[03:43:49.471 --> 03:43:50.831]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:43:50.831 --> 03:43:56.095]  Go to InfoWars.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:43:56.896 --> 03:44:09.571]  Every time I talk to you you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:44:09.571 --> 03:44:11.334]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:44:11.334 --> 03:44:13.096]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:44:13.487 --> 03:44:16.289]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:44:16.289 --> 03:44:18.010]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:44:18.010 --> 03:44:20.532]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[03:44:20.532 --> 03:44:24.875]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:44:24.875 --> 03:44:30.599]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[03:44:30.599 --> 03:44:35.603]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[03:44:35.603 --> 03:44:38.725]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[03:44:38.865 --> 03:44:39.907]  We're good to go.
[03:44:56.912 --> 03:45:01.917]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[03:45:01.917 --> 03:45:04.099]  We made it even stronger.
[03:45:04.099 --> 03:45:07.842]  The strongest long-term energy you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:45:07.842 --> 03:45:12.987]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:12.987 --> 03:45:21.154]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:45:21.154 --> 03:45:22.255]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:45:22.902 --> 03:45:35.970]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:45:35.970 --> 03:45:37.972]  It is the super fuel.
[03:45:37.972 --> 03:45:39.433]  RainForce Plus is great.
[03:45:39.433 --> 03:45:40.293]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:45:40.293 --> 03:45:41.254]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:45:41.254 --> 03:45:42.435]  They go good with this.
[03:45:42.435 --> 03:45:44.476]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:45:45.194 --> 03:45:46.677]  This is the Boss.
[03:45:46.677 --> 03:45:47.398]  TurboForce.
[03:45:47.398 --> 03:45:48.439]  Back in stock.
[03:45:48.439 --> 03:45:49.461]  Discounted.
[03:45:49.461 --> 03:45:51.164]  M4Store.com.
[03:45:51.164 --> 03:45:52.045]  More power.
[03:45:52.045 --> 03:45:53.047]  More strength.
[03:45:53.047 --> 03:45:53.548]  More energy.
[03:45:56.673 --> 03:46:04.097]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:46:04.097 --> 03:46:06.899]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:46:06.899 --> 03:46:15.264]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:46:15.264 --> 03:46:17.685]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:46:17.685 --> 03:46:20.687]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[03:46:21.007 --> 03:46:23.569]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:46:23.569 --> 03:46:31.996]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:46:31.996 --> 03:46:33.837]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[03:46:33.837 --> 03:46:40.463]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:46:40.923 --> 03:46:46.106]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:46:46.106 --> 03:46:52.230]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[03:46:52.230 --> 03:46:57.854]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:57.854 --> 03:47:03.758]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:11.832 --> 03:47:19.218]  Well, the war that Disney is waging against you and your children, mom and dad, is only heating up.
[03:47:19.218 --> 03:47:22.280]  Of course, they're going to sue Governor Ron DeSantis.
[03:47:22.280 --> 03:47:31.487]  Of course, they're going to go after Florida and anyone that's kind of, you know, trying to make a stand against groomers and pedophilia.
[03:47:31.487 --> 03:47:40.314]  But of course, Disney is going to turn around and say, well, this is, uh, this, this is just, uh, you know, this, this is just, uh, the government coming after us.
[03:47:40.314 --> 03:47:40.554]  Well,
[03:47:41.457 --> 03:47:45.400]  Like I said, always take a look at people's responses.
[03:47:45.400 --> 03:48:01.173]  You know, whether it's the government, whether it's humanity, whether it's parents, I think anyone and everyone should protect children from groomers and pedophiles, okay?
[03:48:01.173 --> 03:48:03.275]  Because, you know, Disney openly comes out
[03:48:04.079 --> 03:48:13.548]  They came out and said we have a not-so-secret gay and queer agenda and we are intentionally targeting your children with all our homosexuality and degeneracy.
[03:48:13.548 --> 03:48:13.888]  Why?
[03:48:13.888 --> 03:48:15.209]  Why?
[03:48:15.209 --> 03:48:17.031]  Why would they want to do that?
[03:48:17.031 --> 03:48:20.354]  And why is it that Disney sided with the devil?
[03:48:21.337 --> 03:48:23.018]  And the Skittle people?
[03:48:23.018 --> 03:48:34.744]  When it came to, you know, a teacher should, you know, it is homophobic to not allow a gay teacher to have a private relationship with your child, mom or dad.
[03:48:34.744 --> 03:48:36.665]  That's homophobic if you don't allow that.
[03:48:37.165 --> 03:48:39.006]  You're not letting us say gay!
[03:48:39.006 --> 03:48:43.029]  No, we're protecting children from pedophiles and groomers!
[03:48:43.029 --> 03:48:44.830]  You sick, disgusting degenerate!
[03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:46.011]  Can you not get with that?
[03:48:46.011 --> 03:48:50.094]  Whether you're on the left or the right, or claim to be a conservative, but you're really a conservative?
[03:48:50.094 --> 03:48:52.115]  You claim to be on the right and clear?
[03:48:52.115 --> 03:49:00.241]  Listen, people sit here and claim that they have these conservative Christian values, but they are far from them, whenever you throw it in their face!
[03:49:00.521 --> 03:49:16.451]  Whenever they get around a real Christian conservative, and we start really saying some base stuff, they get all triggered, and you're being too mean, and it's like, dude, dude, go watch, you know, go watch CNN, go watch CookNN, if you can't handle this, okay?
[03:49:16.451 --> 03:49:28.359]  Because this is for, you know, the alpha males and the alpha females that seriously want to have some serious discussions about who we need to identify, and peacefully and lawfully get out of the equation.
[03:49:28.359 --> 03:49:29.700]  Especially the pedophiles!
[03:49:31.368 --> 03:49:32.869]  What?
[03:49:32.869 --> 03:49:35.110]  I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:42.933]  About a conservative that sides with the devil, and that sides with the skittle mob, and that sides with the pedophiles and the groomers.
[03:49:42.933 --> 03:49:44.793]  All in the name of money, by the way.
[03:49:44.793 --> 03:49:49.095]  Nikki Haley, if you guys have not seen this clip, well you're gonna watch it right now.
[03:49:49.095 --> 03:49:52.316]  She was asked on all places!
[03:49:52.316 --> 03:49:53.317]  On Fox News!
[03:49:54.392 --> 03:49:55.353]  All right?
[03:49:55.353 --> 03:49:57.273]  The Tucker Killers.
[03:49:57.273 --> 03:49:58.814]  Deep State Fox News.
[03:49:58.814 --> 03:50:06.958]  She was asked her opinion on the lawsuit on Disney vs. DeSantis and listen to what she, the nerve, okay?
[03:50:06.958 --> 03:50:08.119]  Listen to what she said.
[03:50:08.962 --> 03:50:09.102]  Yes.
[03:50:31.551 --> 03:50:36.297]  Obviously dramatically escalating the feud between Disney and Ron DeSantis.
[03:50:36.297 --> 03:50:44.848]  They're alleging that the Republican governor has waged a quote relentless campaign to weaponize government power over the company.
[03:50:44.848 --> 03:50:50.114]  What is your reaction to that as we still have yet to see him jump officially into the race?
[03:50:52.213 --> 03:50:57.415]  You know, as governor, I took a double-digit unemployment state and I turned it into an economic powerhouse.
[03:50:57.415 --> 03:51:05.739]  Businesses were my partners, because if you take care of your businesses, you take care of your economy, your economy takes care of the people, and everyone wins.
[03:51:05.739 --> 03:51:07.320]  And so that's the way we dealt with it.
[03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:11.301]  South Carolina was a very anti-woke state.
[03:51:11.301 --> 03:51:12.602]  It still is.
[03:51:12.602 --> 03:51:19.144]  And if Disney would like to move their hundreds of thousands of jobs to South Carolina and bring the billions of dollars with them, I'll let them know.
[03:51:19.144 --> 03:51:25.306]  I'll be happy to meet them in South Carolina and introduce them to the governor and the legislature that would welcome it.
[03:51:25.785 --> 03:51:27.926]  Hey, Governor, thank you so much for being with us.
[03:51:27.926 --> 03:51:28.866]  We really appreciate it.
[03:51:28.866 --> 03:51:30.687]  We've got to jump back to the Rose Garden.
[03:51:30.687 --> 03:51:32.027]  Oh, of course you appreciate it.
[03:51:32.027 --> 03:51:33.928]  Of course you appreciate it.
[03:51:33.928 --> 03:51:35.629]  Of course you appreciate it.
[03:51:35.629 --> 03:51:54.916]  Listen, that is a crony capitalist, self-identified conservative that's willing to put money, doesn't matter what the amount is, willing to put money, okay, a price tag over the safety and the innocence and the purity of your child.
[03:51:55.805 --> 03:51:58.307]  She knows what Disney's all about!
[03:51:58.307 --> 03:52:00.828]  She knows they have a not-so-gay agenda!
[03:52:00.828 --> 03:52:05.091]  She knows that the pedos and the groomers are using this as an opportunity!
[03:52:05.091 --> 03:52:05.912]  Come on, really?
[03:52:05.912 --> 03:52:07.012]  You think she doesn't know?
[03:52:07.012 --> 03:52:08.093]  Of course she knows!
[03:52:08.093 --> 03:52:08.894]  But you know what?
[03:52:08.894 --> 03:52:10.215]  We want the money!
[03:52:10.215 --> 03:52:11.535]  We want the money!
[03:52:11.535 --> 03:52:13.056]  Screw the degeneracy!
[03:52:13.056 --> 03:52:15.078]  We'll tolerate the degeneracy!
[03:52:15.078 --> 03:52:17.059]  We'll tolerate the pedophilia!
[03:52:17.059 --> 03:52:18.800]  We'll tolerate the grooming!
[03:52:18.800 --> 03:52:22.783]  We'll tolerate all the immorality and the reprobate behavior!
[03:52:23.283 --> 03:52:25.264]  Just give us the money, Disney!
[03:52:25.264 --> 03:52:26.644]  Just give us the money!
[03:52:26.644 --> 03:52:32.145]  You give us the money, you could be as degenerate and disgusting towards our children as you!
[03:52:32.145 --> 03:52:34.526]  You just have at it, Disney!
[03:52:34.526 --> 03:52:36.066]  You see that, you guys?
[03:52:36.066 --> 03:52:38.727]  That is a wolf in sheep's clothing right there.
[03:52:38.727 --> 03:52:43.688]  That is an individual that does not care about the future of America.
[03:52:43.688 --> 03:52:46.089]  What is the future of America?
[03:52:46.089 --> 03:52:51.170]  The future of America are our children, are our kids, their purity,
[03:52:53.024 --> 03:53:00.068]  Their holiness, their intellectual stability, their education, you name it!
[03:53:00.068 --> 03:53:04.071]  But someone like that is willing to take money!
[03:53:04.071 --> 03:53:05.592]  Hey pedophiles, you're good!
[03:53:05.592 --> 03:53:08.413]  As long as the pedophiles got money, they're okay.
[03:53:08.413 --> 03:53:10.815]  Sound like a New World Order occultist?
[03:53:10.815 --> 03:53:12.516]  Yeah, it does!
[03:53:12.516 --> 03:53:15.197]  Do the math.
[03:53:15.197 --> 03:53:16.038]  Disgusting.
[03:53:16.038 --> 03:53:19.760]  What a disgusting, what a disgusting person, right?
[03:53:19.760 --> 03:53:22.582]  How foul, how foul to say something like that.
[03:53:24.051 --> 03:53:26.812]  Pedophiles and pedo simps deserve to be cancelled.
[03:53:26.812 --> 03:53:31.355]  Pedophiles and pedo simps deserve to be cancelled!
[03:53:31.355 --> 03:53:33.376]  Yeah, I said it.
[03:53:33.376 --> 03:53:34.836]  Argue with it.
[03:53:34.836 --> 03:53:36.317]  And see how that goes for you.
[03:53:36.317 --> 03:53:37.478]  Go defend the pedophiles!
[03:53:37.478 --> 03:53:38.078]  Go for it!
[03:53:38.078 --> 03:53:39.118]  Go for it, bro!
[03:53:39.118 --> 03:53:39.719]  Do it!
[03:53:39.719 --> 03:53:42.300]  I dare you!
[03:53:42.300 --> 03:53:46.322]  Cancel the pedophiles and all the pedo simps that enable them.
[03:53:46.322 --> 03:53:47.803]  It's disgusting.
[03:53:47.803 --> 03:53:50.104]  Absolutely disgusting.
[03:53:50.104 --> 03:53:52.505]  You know, I want to say I can't believe that, but I can believe it.
[03:53:53.527 --> 03:54:02.170]  I mean, you have Elon suspending a Twitter user who created a youth-attracted-person-pedophile flag, and was parading it all around Twitter.
[03:54:02.170 --> 03:54:05.852]  A youth-attracted-person-pedophile flag!
[03:54:05.852 --> 03:54:08.293]  I told you that P was coming!
[03:54:08.293 --> 03:54:10.914]  I told you that P was coming, you guys!
[03:54:10.914 --> 03:54:16.436]  It will be LGBTQ+, I, LMNOP, all the skittles, you name it!
[03:54:16.436 --> 03:54:21.418]  And that P, dude, that P is gonna be a sexual identity!
[03:54:22.256 --> 03:54:25.579]  Because pedophiles are people too.
[03:54:25.579 --> 03:54:28.421]  Because pedophiles just have a hard time.
[03:54:28.421 --> 03:54:30.202]  Pedophiles are just misunderstood.
[03:54:30.202 --> 03:54:32.604]  No, no, no.
[03:54:32.604 --> 03:54:37.247]  They should just get a slap on the wrist and have a conversation with them.
[03:54:37.247 --> 03:54:47.715]  Why do you think that the UN, why do you think that the New World Order is trying to decriminalize sex with minors so they can accept this and it becomes a sexual identity?
[03:54:48.948 --> 03:54:51.870]  And so that the pedophiles can just have open sex with little kids?
[03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:54.512]  Just as long as they get consent from the child!
[03:54:54.512 --> 03:54:57.514]  No, that's statutory rape, ladies and gentlemen!
[03:54:57.514 --> 03:55:02.737]  But of course, with the degeneracy, that is how the reprobate society works.
[03:55:02.737 --> 03:55:06.139]  There is no code of morality whatsoever.
[03:55:06.139 --> 03:55:08.301]  It's just anything goes.
[03:55:08.301 --> 03:55:09.442]  Anything goes.
[03:55:09.442 --> 03:55:14.225]  Speaking of anything goes, Leah Thomas is claiming that those who oppose males
[03:55:15.103 --> 03:55:17.345]  You know, Leo Thomas, this is a dude, man.
[03:55:17.345 --> 03:55:18.065]  This is a dude.
[03:55:18.065 --> 03:55:20.166]  I'm not gonna call him Leo Thomas.
[03:55:20.166 --> 03:55:21.247]  I'm gonna call him a man!
[03:55:21.247 --> 03:55:29.392]  This manswimmer claims those who oppose males playing women's sports are misogynistic transphobes!
[03:55:29.392 --> 03:55:32.214]  Oh, they're misogynistic transphobes!
[03:55:32.214 --> 03:55:33.635]  Yes, ladies, do you hear that?
[03:55:33.635 --> 03:55:36.297]  All the based alpha male info warriors out there?
[03:55:36.297 --> 03:55:38.879]  Alpha female info warriors out there?
[03:55:38.879 --> 03:55:42.881]  The mentally ill man is gonna tell you what it's like to really be a woman, guys.
[03:55:42.881 --> 03:55:43.682]  Take a look at this clip.
[03:55:46.286 --> 03:55:50.071]  They're like, oh, we respect Leah as a woman, as a trans woman, whatever.
[03:55:50.071 --> 03:55:51.332]  We respect her identity.
[03:55:51.332 --> 03:55:52.574]  We just don't think it's fair.
[03:55:52.574 --> 03:55:57.459]  You can't really have that sort of half support where you're like, oh, I respect her as a woman here, but not here.
[03:55:57.459 --> 03:56:01.624]  They're using the guise of feminism to sort of
[03:56:02.365 --> 03:56:04.827]  Push transphobic beliefs.
[03:56:04.827 --> 03:56:14.613]  And I think a lot of people in that camp sort of carry an implicit bias against trans people, but don't want to, I guess, fully manifest or speak that out.
[03:56:14.613 --> 03:56:18.155]  And so they try to just play it off as this sort of half support.
[03:56:18.155 --> 03:56:22.177]  They think about how twisted feminism, quote unquote, feminism has become.
[03:56:22.177 --> 03:56:31.183]  Their arguments, you know, in order to exclude anybody in the trans category, you have to reduce women to reproductive capacity, which is, in my opinion, extremely anti-feminist.
[03:56:31.363 --> 03:56:32.864]  I don't want to put those women down, either.
[03:56:32.864 --> 03:56:34.945]  And I know you don't want to either, because I see pain.
[03:56:34.945 --> 03:56:37.928]  I see pain, and the pain is coming from somewhere.
[03:56:37.928 --> 03:56:38.928]  It's not you, though.
[03:56:38.928 --> 03:56:39.869]  It's the patriarchy.
[03:56:39.869 --> 03:56:41.230]  And how can we get people to see that?
[03:56:44.264 --> 03:56:45.586]  Isn't it crazy?
[03:56:45.586 --> 03:56:46.627]  Isn't it crazy?
[03:56:46.627 --> 03:56:48.529]  He got two dudes.
[03:56:48.529 --> 03:56:52.773]  He got two dudes sitting there just like talking down to women.
[03:56:52.773 --> 03:56:55.256]  You're a transphobe.
