[01:31.400 --> 01:37.480]  memorials under fire once again so just I guarantee you every leftist liberal
[01:37.480 --> 01:48.160]  publication is doing this to their local cities every damn day and all of the
[01:48.160 --> 01:55.440]  issues that the left claims to have in America are all fundamentally results
[01:55.440 --> 02:03.240]  and symptoms of the leftist ideology and the leftist policy but they say
[02:03.240 --> 02:09.800]  black lives matter do black lives really matter to a liberal do black lives
[02:09.800 --> 02:16.000]  really matter to a Democrat well one black man wanted to find out so he went
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.960]  to a hospital where a bunch of virtue signaling hospital workers were taking
[02:20.960 --> 02:24.880]  a knee outside for black lives matter he went to find out if they actually cared
[02:24.880 --> 02:31.880]  about black lives here's how it went matter or just some black lives the
[02:31.880 --> 02:38.560]  black lives killed by black men matter right yes the black babies killed in
[02:38.560 --> 02:44.240]  the abortions clinics matter right thought so the black the black officers
[02:44.240 --> 02:49.640]  killed by that bastard in Minnesota that matters too right okay but the black
[02:49.640 --> 02:53.600]  babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter do they are medical
[02:53.600 --> 03:01.800]  people I do their lives matter does the future of our black babies matter what's
[03:01.800 --> 03:07.440]  up what's up all for quiet now aren't they uh-huh it's okay if we kill them in
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.960]  the womb right but you have a problem when we you don't seem to really have a
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.080]  problem we kill them on the streets yes we know they're the same issue if we
[03:18.080 --> 03:23.280]  don't if we don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them
[03:23.280 --> 03:30.800]  and fight for them our lives mean nothing once we're born folks if you're new
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.080]  to info wars or you're new to politics and you see a lot of this stuff and it's
[03:36.080 --> 03:40.720]  just not really making sense to you why is the left like this why do they say
[03:40.720 --> 03:43.720]  these things why do they do these things who are these people what is
[03:43.720 --> 03:50.720]  motivating them what is driving them what you're witnessing is years of
[03:50.720 --> 03:58.720]  propaganda in the universities in mainstream media news entertainment
[03:58.720 --> 04:06.400]  sports Hollywood the Democrat Party lies and now the censorship and rewriting
[04:06.400 --> 04:14.400]  of history by Google and other big tech industry and so yeah you got a bunch of
[04:14.400 --> 04:18.760]  morons out there taking a knee when they see a black guy coming up asking them
[04:18.760 --> 04:22.040]  if black lives matter because that's how they've been taught that's how they've
[04:22.040 --> 04:26.720]  been programmed and conditioned and they really believe it they really think
[04:26.720 --> 04:32.160]  that if you're black in America it's just so bad for you and you're really a
[04:32.160 --> 04:37.360]  victim of racism and oppression but you know what there's a really dark deep
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.640]  truth to that that they won't tell you and maybe I'll say it today but I'm
[04:41.640 --> 04:45.760]  white so I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about these things oh whitey how
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.560]  come they have it canceled the cracker barrel yet by the way Aunt Jemima she's
[04:49.560 --> 04:54.720]  gone see you Aunt Jemima no more syrup for you is cracker barrel next let's
[04:54.720 --> 05:02.680]  rename it the honky barrel maybe aerodyne technology delivery system the
[05:02.680 --> 05:08.080]  first of its kind pure nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered through a
[05:08.080 --> 05:12.680]  spray bottle the next level of innovation of x2 is here introducing
[05:12.680 --> 05:18.120]  survival shield x2 spray the great part about the x2 spray is it's great on the
[05:18.120 --> 05:21.600]  go when you've got it in the dropper it's great at your house it's you know
[05:21.600 --> 05:25.560]  great at work but this is great for the car it's great to keep with you and
[05:25.560 --> 05:30.320]  again it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine not
[05:30.320 --> 05:34.720]  to just ingest it into the stomach we're really excited about it it's 33% off out
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.200]  of the gates it was listeners idea asking for us come up with a spray bottle
[05:39.200 --> 05:42.640]  that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that
[05:42.640 --> 05:46.680]  aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even
[05:46.680 --> 05:51.520]  better way get your survival shield x2 nascent iodine spray now at 33%
[05:51.520 --> 05:57.120]  off at info or store.com and experience the power of aerosolized x2 nascent iodine
[05:57.120 --> 05:59.920]  for yourself
[06:09.520 --> 06:15.840]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[06:15.840 --> 06:21.680]  listening to alex jones
[06:32.240 --> 06:36.840]  and we need to do much more within the criminal justice system but also within
[06:36.840 --> 06:41.840]  all of our systems to dismantle the structures of racism that our federal
[06:41.840 --> 06:46.760]  state and local governments carefully erected and maintained over centuries we
[06:46.760 --> 06:50.880]  know a little bit about this in virginia the first african-americans in into the
[06:50.880 --> 06:55.840]  English colonies came to quite comfort virginian 1619 they were slaves they've
[06:55.840 --> 07:00.120]  been captured against their will but they landed in colonies that didn't have
[07:00.120 --> 07:05.800]  slavery there were no laws about slavery in the colonies at that time the
[07:05.800 --> 07:10.720]  United States didn't inherit slavery from anybody we created it it got created
[07:10.720 --> 07:14.480]  by the virginia general assembly and the legislatures of other states it got
[07:14.480 --> 07:20.520]  created by the court systems in colonial america and sense that enforced fusion
[07:20.520 --> 07:26.720]  of slave laws why would senator tim pain tell a lie so big so massive so over
[07:26.720 --> 07:31.440]  the top ridiculous i'll explain why in a moment but first it's critical to
[07:31.440 --> 07:36.320]  understand that the united states did inherit slavery and it was england and
[07:36.320 --> 07:40.640]  then the united states later that led the world in eradicating and in almost
[07:40.640 --> 07:46.360]  every part of the planet except the middle east and africa slavery is as
[07:46.360 --> 07:53.000]  old as recorded history it's documented going back over 10,000 years and took
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  place in every culture it is in the bible it is in the caran it is in the
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.760]  roman and greek histories it is in the chinese histories it is a evil
[08:04.760 --> 08:10.760]  institution and we're going back into a form of globalist slavery today and a
[08:10.760 --> 08:14.440]  new class system where the establishment has total surveillance
[08:14.440 --> 08:18.800]  groups over where the people has access to medical care and information that we
[08:18.800 --> 08:24.960]  don't have access to access to this is a new form of slavery but to say that the
[08:24.960 --> 08:30.920]  west is guilty of the original sin of slavery and that we created it or
[08:30.920 --> 08:35.360]  pro-generated it is an assault on the idea of the west itself and the
[08:35.360 --> 08:39.800]  renaissance that actually began the process of empowering humanity and
[08:39.800 --> 08:45.880]  ending slavery so it's direct assault on the western open free society that the
[08:45.880 --> 08:50.720]  globalist model that is a true modern form of high-tech slavery is directly at
[08:50.720 --> 08:57.840]  loggerheads with and so that's why tim cane the globalist the Jesuit
[08:57.840 --> 09:01.360]  operative in his antifa son who's been arrested and all the rest of them
[09:01.360 --> 09:07.560]  continue to lie like this because they are assaulting reality on purpose they're
[09:07.560 --> 09:13.040]  training you that that they tell you lies that there aren't two genders that
[09:13.040 --> 09:17.320]  there are no borders no walls that america is evil that our police are
[09:17.320 --> 09:21.680]  the worst on the planet while they themselves at the united nations carry
[09:21.680 --> 09:26.000]  out the most brutal mass murders and exterminations and enslavement the
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.840]  planets ever seen i mean literally it is on record that apple runs the worst
[09:30.840 --> 09:36.400]  slave factories on the planet that three million Uighurs in china work in a
[09:36.400 --> 09:40.520]  variety of slave industries including building components for apple iphone's
[09:40.520 --> 09:44.600]  other apple devices but again none of that matters because he's tim cane his
[09:44.600 --> 09:49.320]  sons in antifa and he's going to tell you that the united states and the
[09:49.320 --> 09:54.480]  colonies before it invented slavery when for a hundred and fifty years before
[09:54.480 --> 09:58.200]  there were any slaves in north america there were slaves in the caribbean under
[09:58.200 --> 10:02.040]  the spanish and the portuguese that's why a lot of africans got brought to the
[10:02.040 --> 10:04.640]  Caribbean that's why there's africans all over the Caribbean that's why in
[10:04.640 --> 10:07.840]  brazil there's so many black people because they were brought there by the
[10:07.840 --> 10:14.040]  portuguese four hundred plus years ago in the spanish again slavery didn't get
[10:14.040 --> 10:18.880]  cranky here until about three hundred years ago and only operated for about a
[10:18.880 --> 10:23.400]  hundred and fifty years but facts don't supposedly matter to these people they
[10:23.400 --> 10:27.160]  just tell whatever outrageous lies they want these are despicable degenerate
[10:27.160 --> 10:30.800]  pieces of trash but of course he made a great running mate with hillary didn't
[10:30.800 --> 10:35.440]  me because they loved to scientifically condition us to accept their lying
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.600]  scams their total giant frauds and their ignorant followers actually hear this
[10:40.600 --> 10:45.120]  and we'll now pick it up as a talking point even though most of them know
[10:45.120 --> 10:49.240]  it's not true because they have converted their followers into willing
[10:49.240 --> 10:52.680]  accomplices in their criminal takeover and that's why they're an unamerican
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.280]  party that is hell-bent with foreign collaborator operations and quizlings to
[10:57.280 --> 11:00.760]  overthrow this country and that's why we have to completely break with these
[11:00.760 --> 11:06.680]  individuals and not gives them you know any sucker any support you have to
[11:06.680 --> 11:10.000]  challenge them and get in their face and announce them as the anti-american
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.800]  anti-freedom abortion eugenics globalist loving trash they are it really
[11:16.800 --> 11:21.160]  is incredible to think tim kane would have been the vice president of the
[11:21.160 --> 11:28.480]  united states an evil man a wicked man who has such a snake tongue he tells
[11:28.480 --> 11:38.920]  lies with no hesitation at all none fact the first slaves brought to what we
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.560]  know is modern-day america we're actually irish the african slaves that
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.720]  tim kane is talking about were brought over here by africans and even more
[11:48.720 --> 11:53.600]  ironic enough if you believe this I mean you don't have to believe it's the
[11:53.600 --> 12:02.760]  truth the old kente cloth scarf that they wore was actually a slave trade
[12:02.760 --> 12:10.600]  ghani's tribe that originated that that was their marking and they used to go
[12:10.600 --> 12:15.560]  this this tribe that wore the kente cloth they they was theirs that was their
[12:15.560 --> 12:19.720]  mark they used to go around africa conquering land taking the people and
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.280]  then selling them into slavery literally that's where that scarf comes from and
[12:24.280 --> 12:29.120]  then the democrats put it on and claim their anti-slavery when tim kane who
[12:29.120 --> 12:31.600]  would have been the vice president under hillary clinton tells you that the
[12:31.600 --> 12:39.280]  united states created slavery a massive whopper of a lie you couldn't believe if
[12:39.280 --> 12:44.920]  you saw it in a movie or read it in a sci-fi novel or anything but that's what
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.520]  the democrats do now is they go to the full extreme hey we're gonna virtue
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.160]  signal wearing a kente cloth that was actually the symbolic cloth of the
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.760]  number one slave trade in west africa group don't worry our constituents are
[12:59.760 --> 13:05.760]  stupid they'll never know tim kane says we created slavery he knows that's not
[13:05.760 --> 13:11.840]  true but he knows his constituents are dumber than a box of rocks and they know
[13:11.840 --> 13:15.920]  they can go out and create race crime and violence against white people which is
[13:15.920 --> 13:22.600]  what they're doing now and by the way I mean I played about six clips yesterday
[13:22.600 --> 13:27.120]  of all the anti-white hate crime that's going on in this country there's another
[13:27.120 --> 13:35.240]  one today that we have of a guy at the mall you know I hate to be the one that
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.320]  has to say this but I don't think anybody else will so maybe I should be the
[13:39.320 --> 13:52.280]  one that says it jay-z and rap gangbanging culture brought to you by
[13:52.280 --> 14:02.520]  democrats bringing in crack to your inner cities brought to you by yeah you
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.960]  want to talk about a agenda to get black people it's in the rap industry that's
[14:06.960 --> 14:13.400]  why you don't have Lewis Armstrong and Nat King Cole or Aretha Franklin or any
[14:13.400 --> 14:17.920]  of those great musicians that wore classy dresses and suits and ties no now
[14:17.920 --> 14:21.920]  you get Jay Z and the gangbanging culture is black culture that was done by the
[14:21.920 --> 14:28.480]  CIA call it a deep state program yeah it's the Democrats were behind it Lynn
[14:28.480 --> 14:32.720]  Baines Johnson probably Joe Biden too he's been around long enough to be a
[14:32.720 --> 14:42.160]  part of all this and so play that b-roll again here's a guy at a mall who
[14:42.160 --> 14:46.600]  decides he's just gonna beat up a white man senselessly he's got of course his
[14:46.600 --> 14:50.720]  drawers below his butthole because that means he's gay he doesn't realize that
[14:50.720 --> 14:54.040]  that was programmed into him by the rap industry which he obviously listens to
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.400]  and so he thinks that behaving like a thug is now his culture because that's
[14:58.400 --> 15:02.160]  what Jay Z taught him so he didn't even realize that he's actually asking you to
[15:02.160 --> 15:05.880]  have gay sex with him in the butt I'm not trying to be funny here folks that's
[15:05.880 --> 15:09.760]  what this is it was well known in prison you wore your you wore your pants below
[15:09.760 --> 15:13.320]  your butt that means hey I'm open for business but then they brought it into
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.280]  the rap industry and they made it black culture as a big joke for black people
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.040]  because that's what the Democrats are doing to you folks do you want to know
[15:21.040 --> 15:26.960]  the truth because because by the way the guy says oh he called me the n-word so I
[15:26.960 --> 15:30.480]  can just beat him up so that'll be the new excuse black people are using to
[15:30.480 --> 15:34.320]  create hate crimes against white people but here's the truth folks it was Jay Z
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.360]  and it was the rap industry with with with MTV and all the other people
[15:39.360 --> 15:45.360]  involved that made black people young black men not want to be men and godly
[15:45.360 --> 15:52.000]  men and strong men and leaders but made them want to be n-words that's what it
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.400]  is that was an insult and now to joke and black men are calling each other that
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.200]  word it's a big joke I'm always excited about M4's life products they're
[16:00.200 --> 16:03.280]  amazing they're cutting edge you love them I love them and they find the info
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.560]  war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new
[16:07.560 --> 16:15.280]  product over a year in development that is amazing the only organic hand
[16:15.280 --> 16:20.760]  sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and there's
[16:20.760 --> 16:26.720]  another innovation it's spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[16:26.720 --> 16:32.440]  gross you goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way I
[16:32.440 --> 16:36.560]  like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic
[16:36.560 --> 16:40.760]  alcohol in it so spray it around your eyes but I just love it personally has
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.880]  something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real innovation I don't know
[16:44.880 --> 16:48.720]  why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[16:48.720 --> 16:53.520]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing
[16:53.520 --> 17:00.280]  this is a big winner it's finally here introducing the first of its kind
[17:00.280 --> 17:04.880]  nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine listeners have been asking us
[17:04.880 --> 17:08.680]  for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth
[17:08.680 --> 17:12.400]  crystal nascent iodine after extensive development it's finally here our
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.400]  proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.040]  ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into an
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.000]  ultimate spray formula I have been using the new x2 spray every day and I feel
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.520]  good knowing that I have the power of true nascent iodine working for my body
[17:27.520 --> 17:31.440]  I can personally feel the difference we know iodine is an essential mineral that
[17:31.440 --> 17:35.560]  supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism healthy hormone
[17:35.560 --> 17:39.440]  levels and healthy cognitive function iodine may also support your body and

[18:47.280 --> 18:53.640]  yesterday at a local precinct meeting and this is catching on like wildfire
[18:53.640 --> 18:57.920]  today I mean I didn't even talk to these people I don't talk to but sex the
[18:57.920 --> 19:02.840]  former CIA guy on Fox News by the way I like buck sexton that's just a whole
[19:02.840 --> 19:07.360]  joke the CIA guys do with all these goofy names like buck sextons and dr.
[19:07.360 --> 19:12.160]  anal sex it's a big joke but but they know the general public wouldn't even
[19:12.160 --> 19:17.200]  believe it so they just go ahead and do it right in front of your face but he's
[19:17.200 --> 19:22.080]  talking about it Josh Howley gave a powerful speech on the floor today all
[19:22.080 --> 19:25.760]  about it again I don't talk to the Missouri senator I didn't talk to them
[19:25.760 --> 19:30.600]  before I gave my speech last night I didn't you know so it's like Republicans
[19:30.600 --> 19:36.240]  and conservatives are starting to get it now the problem is within the Republican
[19:36.240 --> 19:40.640]  Party there's a bunch of stopgap just old heads that just don't get it yet but

[22:28.320 --> 22:31.880]  which is really just the Democrat Party think about that the Democrat Party puts
[22:31.880 --> 22:38.360]  out all these front groups as like a wall politically around them it's like so
[22:38.360 --> 22:42.320]  it's like they're protected by all this front group BS like black lives matter or
[22:42.320 --> 22:46.280]  Occupy Wall Street or March for our lives or whatever the hell else it is
[22:46.280 --> 22:51.240]  it's all just walls stopping you from getting to the heart of the crime which
[22:51.240 --> 22:57.760]  is the Democrat Party but I digress info wars store.com baby lives matter put
[22:57.760 --> 23:02.560]  that on your baby today I would say hey tweet it at me I'll retweet you but I'm
[23:02.560 --> 23:08.000]  banned but you should still do that okay so here's the censorship we're
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.160]  enduring now if you recall yesterday I covered the study that came out that
[23:12.160 --> 23:19.280]  basically shows what we already know social media marketing is now basically
[23:19.280 --> 23:23.760]  the market economy if you want to be at marketing and advertising social media is
[23:23.760 --> 23:29.720]  now the way to go billboards and print and radio and TV is going the way of the
[23:29.720 --> 23:33.560]  dodo bird everything's going digital everything's going to social media and
[23:33.560 --> 23:39.720]  so they did a study with a paper that they released and it got one got the
[23:39.720 --> 23:44.920]  social media marketing the other didn't and it was like ten times the response
[23:44.920 --> 23:50.680]  and that was just on Twitter but think about Facebook YouTube everything so and
[23:50.680 --> 23:56.000]  I'll be honest folks it does bother me it makes me feel good that info wars is the
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.800]  tip of the spear and that's why we get the most bans but it also bothers me I'm
[23:59.800 --> 24:04.920]  not gonna lie yeah you know what I got a bit of an ego I'm selfish I have I have
[24:04.920 --> 24:10.560]  I have these tendencies I'm on camera all day I should this show right now
[24:10.560 --> 24:15.960]  should be on YouTube with a hundred thousand live audience right now we
[24:15.960 --> 24:21.360]  don't get that access all the research all the effort all the great crew
[24:21.360 --> 24:27.280]  everything you've done all of it all of us together we should be number one and
[24:27.280 --> 24:33.560]  we would be we would be number one today we would be number one tomorrow we would
[24:33.560 --> 24:37.960]  be number one yesterday we don't get that access because we love America we
[24:37.960 --> 24:43.960]  love God we're real so it does bother me yeah I'll be honest that that pisses me
[24:43.960 --> 24:50.360]  off but I also know that's the biggest victory of all being the number one
[24:50.360 --> 24:59.040]  enemy in media of the anti-american New World Order but here you go so now NBC is
[24:59.040 --> 25:05.520]  working with a bunch of leftist cults in censorship that all have ties to Black
[25:05.520 --> 25:09.360]  Lives Matter or foreign funding literally it's been traced back and so this
[25:09.360 --> 25:15.520]  NBC reporter says thanks to the SF fake news and CCD hate for their hard work
[25:15.520 --> 25:21.800]  and collaboration in getting zero hedge and the federalists blocked by ad sense
[25:21.800 --> 25:27.080]  and Google ads that should be a lawsuit that will cost them a lot of money I
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.960]  don't know their numbers I know it cost us millions when they did it most people
[25:31.960 --> 25:37.360]  couldn't survive that we did it thanks to you but actually the reporter from NBC
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.320]  who put this out deleted her original tweet which also had the hashtag
[25:42.320 --> 25:49.600]  Black Lives Matter and again you can go follow the digital footprint breadcrumbs
[25:49.600 --> 25:53.240]  of these people it's all Black Lives Matter Democrat funded foreign funded
[25:53.240 --> 25:58.680]  grouping censoring your free speech censoring the free speech of Americans
[25:58.680 --> 26:02.920]  in fours comm headline NBC news reporter thanks foreign groups for
[26:02.920 --> 26:08.400]  collaboration and pushing Google to defund the federalists and zero hedge
[26:08.400 --> 26:12.440]  national file digital hate watchdog that got zero hedge banned from ad sense
[26:12.440 --> 26:16.200]  releases website blacklist they're coming for you next folks and again it's
[26:16.200 --> 26:19.080]  all the same people to fund the Democrat Party and all these other groups
[26:19.080 --> 26:23.920]  with Soros and the rest of them info wars comm headline petition launched to
[26:23.920 --> 26:28.600]  uncover the Winston Churchill statue you know this image is the left in a
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.120]  nutshell if they don't like something they just covered up and pretend it's not
[26:32.120 --> 26:38.360]  there and then they just tell you your racist or a bigot if you think that it
[26:38.360 --> 26:42.160]  shouldn't be covered but what are they really trying to cover up folks
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.560]  Bill Gates involvement with coronavirus and the vaccines they claim oh that's a
[26:46.560 --> 26:50.680]  conspiracy theory don't talk about that will censor you don't talk about Warren
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.320]  Buffett's brick company but but there's a twist to that it wasn't his but the
[26:55.320 --> 26:57.920]  bricks were real
[27:01.680 --> 27:07.400]  globalists have gotten away with their Russia gate hoax their Ukraine hoax their
[27:07.400 --> 27:16.280]  COVID-19 hoax and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020 we've got to ask
[27:16.280 --> 27:19.680]  ourselves what's coming next I can tell you it's gonna be a bunch of big old
[27:19.680 --> 27:25.280]  fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war to the economic collapse
[27:25.280 --> 27:31.280]  China invading Taiwan Hong Kong you name it the globalists are attacking on
[27:31.280 --> 27:35.440]  every front that's why now more than ever we have to realize they tried to
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.720]  censor in fours off the air because they knew when they launched this whole
[27:39.720 --> 27:43.480]  situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air but
[27:43.480 --> 27:48.520]  thanks to you and our crew we are still on air so let's boost that
[27:48.520 --> 27:56.120]  transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever in four lives one of our
[27:56.120 --> 28:00.120]  best-selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for over four
[28:00.120 --> 28:03.560]  months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got
[28:03.560 --> 28:06.640]  a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and I want those of
[28:06.640 --> 28:09.640]  you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself here
[28:09.640 --> 28:13.880]  just part of one testimonial I looked in January 2016 I went in a hospital I
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.720]  went to VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until June and one of
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.120]  the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three
[28:22.120 --> 28:26.080]  hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living
[28:26.080 --> 28:30.200]  defense let me tell you something man I had an internal digestive problem and
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.040]  I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every
[28:34.040 --> 28:37.520]  time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing
[28:37.520 --> 28:40.560]  you and Dr. Group and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get me
[28:40.560 --> 28:43.200]  some of that freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any
[28:43.200 --> 28:46.080]  nutritional because they don't want you to have a stuff but I ordered it had
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.320]  accepted me I got it I hid it from the nurses I started taking it man that
[28:50.320 --> 28:55.600]  stuff changed my life it saved my life Alex Jones and info wars saved my life

[29:58.920 --> 30:04.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[30:04.360 --> 30:25.240]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer
[30:25.240 --> 30:30.240]  folks we had a golden opportunity right now in America and I'm gonna explain
[30:30.240 --> 30:39.080]  this coming up in the next hour but we can't really we don't really get this
[30:39.080 --> 30:54.120]  feedback since the censorship against us but the soil is ripe for patriotism for
[30:54.120 --> 30:58.600]  redpilling for America first for info wars whatever you want to say the soil
[30:58.600 --> 31:03.280]  is ripe and I really am excited to talk about this in the second hour and they
[31:03.280 --> 31:07.280]  get get your response to this but I'm telling you folks what used to be
[31:07.280 --> 31:14.760]  considered fringe or conspiracy or far right wingers or whatever you want to
[31:14.760 --> 31:20.160]  call it is now mainstream conservative politics we just haven't realized it yet
[31:20.160 --> 31:25.800]  because no leaders have really pushed the gas on this even Trump has kind of
[31:25.800 --> 31:33.040]  let off the gas on this a little bit but the engine is full and primed and the
[31:33.040 --> 31:39.600]  track is hot but I'll get into that coming up in the next hour I want to
[31:39.600 --> 31:44.880]  finish because I was cut short a little bit by the break tying this back into
[31:44.880 --> 31:49.920]  the censorship so they don't want you talking about Bill Gates they don't want
[31:49.920 --> 31:54.520]  the hashtag exposed Bill Gates and they got all the things saying oh Bill Gates
[31:54.520 --> 31:58.240]  isn't involved with coronavirus oh Bill Gates isn't involved with the shutdown
[31:58.240 --> 32:01.920]  oh Bill Gates isn't involved with vaccines or microchipping and you're
[32:01.920 --> 32:05.120]  sitting here like wait a second I know he's involved with all of that yes but
[32:05.120 --> 32:18.040]  see Bill Gates owns all of this media and so they cover for him and it shouldn't
[32:18.040 --> 32:23.920]  matter though whether you think Bill Gates is bad or not you have the right
[32:23.920 --> 32:29.520]  to free speech and you have the right to talk about what Bill Gates is up to
[32:29.520 --> 32:34.880]  without being censored or de-platformed or demonetized or shut down or slandered
[32:34.880 --> 32:41.040]  or libeled but they don't let you do that but see here's what they really do
[32:41.040 --> 32:45.600]  because this is the real Shaden Freud right here but but when they run an
[32:45.600 --> 32:51.360]  operation like this you know you're on to something big I can give you a couple
[32:51.360 --> 32:57.800]  examples but I think the audience that's been around will know but here's the
[32:57.800 --> 33:02.520]  latest how Warren Buffett's brick company got caught up in a conspiracy
[33:02.520 --> 33:07.920]  theory about US protests well that's not really accurate so what's the story
[33:07.920 --> 33:13.800]  well if you remember during the use of the first wave of the George Floyd
[33:13.800 --> 33:20.720]  riots in about five or six cities you had pallets of bricks just placed in the
[33:20.720 --> 33:26.760]  middle of the the riot areas magically right how'd they get there who'd they
[33:26.760 --> 33:30.360]  come from well nobody really seems to know I guess we don't get an
[33:30.360 --> 33:34.440]  investigation we don't get to use the surveillance grid for that but they were
[33:34.440 --> 33:39.960]  there and they were used to as part of the riots so Warren Buffett as a brick
[33:39.960 --> 33:44.640]  company that he's invested in and a picture goes around of a pallet of Warren
[33:44.640 --> 33:48.680]  Buffett bricks with the logo and then maybe some people talk about that I
[33:48.680 --> 33:52.080]  mean I'm entrenched and ingrained in the media as much as anybody else and I
[33:52.080 --> 33:57.400]  never even saw this so this really shows you that they probably false flagged
[33:57.400 --> 34:03.560]  this entire thing somebody put this up of the Warren Buffett brick company and
[34:03.560 --> 34:06.960]  then made some false claim like these are the bricks used so they could come
[34:06.960 --> 34:12.320]  and run this in around pretending like the whole conspiracy that there were
[34:12.320 --> 34:16.400]  bricks laid out for the for the rioters during the Floyd riots there during the
[34:16.400 --> 34:20.680]  Democrat riots oh that was just a conspiracy see we traced it back if they
[34:20.680 --> 34:23.480]  were just trying to blame Warren Buffett and then say that this would these
[34:23.480 --> 34:26.600]  bricks weren't even there in fact the cops even investigated these bricks and
[34:26.600 --> 34:31.120]  it was part of a housing site of course that's not even the that's not even the
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.120]  story nobody was talking about those bricks nobody ever saw those bricks
[34:35.120 --> 34:41.800]  those bricks were never on the streets but you see oh somebody did place the
[34:41.800 --> 34:46.760]  bricks on the streets and it obviously goes up way way high so they had to run
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.760]  an operation a false flag making you think oh this was the bricks they were
[34:51.760 --> 34:55.120]  talking about oh they were blaming Warren Buffett even though none of that
[34:55.120 --> 35:00.560]  ever happened it was all their own head fake it was all their own play action
[35:00.560 --> 35:05.280]  this is what they do this is what they've done on other such things
[35:05.280 --> 35:15.440]  Pizzagate is one example I'll stop right there so I'm just telling you folks the
[35:15.440 --> 35:21.280]  levels of deception that we're dealing with right now are unparalleled
[35:21.280 --> 35:27.920]  unparalleled and so it's pretty extreme see now that's the real stuff right
[35:27.920 --> 35:35.520]  there but you see then they roll these other things like oh well the government
[35:35.520 --> 35:39.600]  put these out for barricades oh these were put out here for projects but of
[35:39.600 --> 35:43.080]  course those were never the subject of the discussion of the bricks that were
[35:43.080 --> 35:49.640]  placed out during these riots it's all a big head fake folks it's all a big oh
[35:49.640 --> 35:54.080]  see plant your own evidence plant your own fake evidence and then run your own
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.080]  investigation of the fake evidence and then claim you've discovered the whole
[35:58.080 --> 36:08.000]  truth even though the whole thing was staged this is what they do and I
[36:08.000 --> 36:19.520]  understand why it's so hard for people to believe this but I think because of the
[36:19.520 --> 36:23.080]  fake Russian collusion and the fake Ukrainian quid pro quo and the fake
[36:23.080 --> 36:27.440]  justy small let hate crime and the stormy Daniels and everything else in the
[36:27.440 --> 36:34.680]  fake pandemic and everything people are starting to get it more than ever and so
[36:34.680 --> 36:41.800]  when they're gonna bring back now and they will they're getting ready for the
[36:41.800 --> 36:50.600]  second wave of coronavirus ladies and gentlemen get ready some of the headlines
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.280]  by the way most is being pushed by drudge I'm pretty sure almost all
[36:55.280 --> 37:01.920]  conservatives and Trump supporters who who once mainline drudge had that as
[37:01.920 --> 37:05.520]  their landing page I'm pretty sure everyone's abandoned drudge so I don't
[37:05.520 --> 37:08.520]  know what happened to Matt drudge or what happened to the drudge report but
[37:08.520 --> 37:15.600]  it's definitely not what it once was and everybody seems to notice that but so
[37:15.600 --> 37:19.360]  most of this propaganda is actually coming from drudge like the red
[37:19.360 --> 37:26.240]  headline I wouldn't go to a Trump rally dr. Fauci health workers feel the toll of
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.560]  the virus fight oh and it's all about how tough it is for the health workers
[37:30.560 --> 37:37.800]  out of the AP how about the police officers that are getting murdered how
[37:37.800 --> 37:40.720]  about the old people who got murdered by democratic governors we'll get more into
[37:40.720 --> 37:46.120]  that rush to disinfect offices has some environmental health experts worried I
[37:46.120 --> 37:49.160]  can't remember when I was talking about this if it was the Alex Jones show or the
[37:49.160 --> 37:53.760]  war room that I normally host three to six p.m. at banned out video all the
[37:53.760 --> 37:59.560]  spraying all the chemicals all these things are so bad for our environment
[37:59.560 --> 38:04.080]  they're so bad for you in general yeah they kill viruses guess what they're
[38:04.080 --> 38:09.920]  killing you too but see we don't think about that it's all about oh we've been
[38:09.920 --> 38:14.080]  put into a panic and fear by the media so we've got to do something hyper
[38:14.080 --> 38:19.760]  sanitize everything make our environment totally foreign poisonous chemicals
[38:19.760 --> 38:26.680]  and also give up our freedom in privacy well it's not going to well 71% of
[38:26.680 --> 38:31.400]  Americans reject privacy killing contact tracing apps they're already out there
[38:31.400 --> 38:35.520]  folks you're already being contact trace you just don't know it yet but it's the
[38:35.520 --> 38:41.480]  same thing oh we've got a global pandemic we care about you we love you
[38:41.480 --> 38:49.120]  we're gonna spy on you in real time for your safety oh we love you we love you
[38:49.120 --> 38:53.600]  so much you little American yes we're gonna spray you with a bunch of poisonous
[38:53.600 --> 39:01.440]  chemicals to keep you clean during a virus yes oh did I mention we're gonna
[39:01.440 --> 39:05.640]  run fake studies about hydroxychloroquine cuz we know that actually works as a
[39:05.640 --> 39:09.400]  preventative but we don't want you to be healthy cuz we're sick psycho
[39:09.400 --> 39:15.160]  psychopathic freaks and Bill Gates is gonna give us a lot of money he's gonna
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.320]  make billions off of this vaccine and the contact tracing he said he'd share
[39:19.320 --> 39:27.560]  with me oh oh wait I had a grandma on a nursing home that they sent COVID into
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.960]  and now she's dead but you know what I don't care that the Democrats murdered
[39:32.960 --> 39:37.840]  my grandma because it's worth it to kill America because America's racist and bad
[39:37.840 --> 39:41.680]  and bigoted and and not a good country at all even though everybody in their mom
[39:41.680 --> 39:44.080]  wants to try to come here because it's the best country in the history of the
[39:44.080 --> 39:48.240]  world I just I think it's okay so I'm okay with the Democrats killing my
[39:48.240 --> 39:52.040]  grandma on the nursing home to end America I think that's good and we
[39:52.040 --> 39:59.400]  should censor anybody that disagrees aerodyne technology delivery system the
[39:59.400 --> 40:04.800]  first of its kind pure nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered through a

[41:28.240 --> 41:32.400]  a lot worse roads we'd probably go down but we've mitigated some of this but it's

[43:57.360 --> 44:04.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:10.600 --> 44:18.560]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[44:18.560 --> 44:30.560]  I'm just as frustrated with president trump as most of you but I understand
[44:30.560 --> 44:34.480]  that he is trying to restore the republic and turn our economy back on and
[44:34.480 --> 44:39.120]  secure our borders he has legitimately fought very very hard and gotten hundreds
[44:39.120 --> 44:44.040]  of critical things done yes he's failed massively when it comes to rating in big
[44:44.040 --> 44:49.960]  text censorship surveillance abuse and bullying of the American people and he's
[44:49.960 --> 44:55.000]  failed to deliver on exposing vaccines as he promises to do the list goes on and
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.720]  on regardless with less than 140 days left for the election the deep state is
[44:59.720 --> 45:03.760]  moving against the president that means against we the people so my question to
[45:03.760 --> 45:09.960]  the audience and everyone else is what should we do to support the president and
[45:09.960 --> 45:13.240]  to kick him into high gear get him outside of his bubble to take action and
[45:13.240 --> 45:18.120]  what should those bold actions be when shroyer is hosting the broadcast today
[45:18.120 --> 45:22.360]  I think it's a question he should pose to the audience and take phone calls and
[45:22.360 --> 45:28.520]  ask that question but I know this it's up to we the people to start taking action
[45:28.520 --> 45:32.440]  as well so again instead of getting mad at president trump let's look in the
[45:32.440 --> 45:35.880]  mirror and ask how are we gonna give him a good kick on the butt and how we're
[45:35.880 --> 45:40.480]  gonna give ourselves a good kick in the ass to take action all I know is our
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.720]  country is completely overrun by globalist and globalist sympathizers
[45:44.720 --> 45:50.200]  who cannot wait to put this country into a permanent mass of depression and then
[45:50.200 --> 45:54.720]  use the economic degradation for social control over us all what they can do now
[45:54.720 --> 45:58.840]  with big text surveillance and manipulation to monitor us and force
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.200]  compliance is something the planets never seen before now here's some good
[46:03.200 --> 46:07.600]  news and some bad news on that front story up on info wars dot com by Steve
[46:07.600 --> 46:12.720]  Watson 71% of Americans reject privacy killing contact tracing apps
[46:12.720 --> 46:17.480]  european citizens also say no to government monitoring fact europe has
[46:17.480 --> 46:22.040]  similar numbers almost three quarters of Americans say they will not submit
[46:22.040 --> 46:27.400]  their privacy to contact tracing apps the european union also rejecting the
[46:27.400 --> 46:30.040]  notion outright because they do not trust government to keep their
[46:30.040 --> 46:35.160]  information safe and refrain from misusing it a study a major study reveals
[46:35.160 --> 46:39.600]  that the vast majority of Americans are against contact tracing apps with 71
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.120]  percent saying they will not download them and 75 percent believing their
[46:44.120 --> 46:48.160]  digital privacy is at risk from the technology but here's the problem four
[46:48.160 --> 46:53.640]  months ago apple and google merged their database and their tracking system on
[46:53.640 --> 46:57.880]  their operating systems and are coordinating with communist china the
[46:57.880 --> 47:02.120]  EU the UN and others to track where you are in live time regardless that's been
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.320]  given to quote law enforcement so this is a police state that I vehemently
[47:06.320 --> 47:12.600]  oppose and that's another example a window into understanding what a real
[47:12.600 --> 47:16.920]  police state is versus quote abolishing the police a police state is where you're
[47:16.920 --> 47:20.800]  surveilled and where you're controlled and where if you don't comply with the
[47:20.800 --> 47:24.160]  system you get arrested you get imprisoned that's the old sense of it and
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.840]  where there's basically a police officer and a spy and a snitch on every corner
[47:28.840 --> 47:32.720]  and your neighbors your children are writing you out for cash payments that's
[47:32.720 --> 47:36.480]  what the democrats have been erecting in their blue cities their blue states the
[47:36.480 --> 47:41.600]  republicans to a certain extent but under the covid hoax we have seen a real
[47:41.600 --> 47:47.360]  rejection by republicans in a populist movement across party lines saying no
[47:47.360 --> 47:50.840]  to this surveillance no to the mask no to the contact tracing you see
[47:50.840 --> 47:56.560]  democrats embrace it as a tool of power and control and you see the democrats
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.160]  openly say oh we have a hundred thousand people out in New York for black
[48:01.160 --> 48:06.760]  lives matter you in globalist party takeover but if Trump was to have a
[48:06.760 --> 48:10.240]  rally it's evil it's a white supremacist event and it's gonna spread covid so
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.440]  there's a direct war on logic and all this is a way to lock down their
[48:14.440 --> 48:27.160]  political enemies while they themselves operate and so that's why the I am
[48:27.160 --> 48:32.320]  just but it doesn't dictate what we do well imagine as the nation states of
[48:32.320 --> 48:36.760]  Brazil the UK and the United States try to pull out of this whole world
[48:36.760 --> 48:41.200]  government compact we're being told no we can't and at meetings at Davos last
[48:41.200 --> 48:45.480]  three years Xi Jinping and others have been in the new saying working with the
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.280]  EU China and the corporate bureaucracy we're going to quote defeat America
[48:50.280 --> 48:54.080]  we're gonna defeat the Brexit we're gonna defeat Bolsonaro we're gonna
[48:54.080 --> 48:58.960]  defeat your worldwide movement of liberty and that China will be the model
[48:58.960 --> 49:02.440]  this is what the globalist and the controllers and the elites and the
[49:02.440 --> 49:05.960]  academics all talk about this is what's in the CFR publications this is just the
[49:05.960 --> 49:11.320]  reality of like sitting down at a restaurant they bring you a menu this is
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.800]  what's going on and until the general public understands this world view and
[49:15.800 --> 49:19.520]  understands how existential this threat is to all of us we don't have a hope but
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.080]  getting back briefly the police state the police state is a authoritarian
[49:24.080 --> 49:30.480]  unconstitutional oppressive mode of authoritarian governance that's what the
[49:30.480 --> 49:33.760]  new old order the Democrats the blue states are the Republicans have their
[49:33.760 --> 49:37.120]  problems and have embraced a lot of tyranny as well but now they're realizing
[49:37.120 --> 49:41.080]  what's happening and pulling away and now here's the heart of it I saw police
[49:41.080 --> 49:47.000]  being trained 25 26 27 years ago to be like the feds were at Waco and just come
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.720]  in and slaughter Americans and confiscate guns and burn up men women and
[49:50.720 --> 49:57.720]  children and so I was against that because the feds getting their curriculum
[49:57.720 --> 50:02.760]  from the ADL and so the primary law center were literally in their training
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.800]  local police departments in the threat fusion centers and the joint terrorism
[50:06.800 --> 50:12.000]  task forces to wage war on America you've seen the training manuals the
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.800]  mic reports all of it that gun owners are terrorists that if somebody says get
[50:16.800 --> 50:19.480]  people you'll get people out of the UN has a bumper sticker go ahead and
[50:19.480 --> 50:23.360]  arrest them I mean you're talking about Soviet Union type stuff but the
[50:23.360 --> 50:27.040]  American people spoke out we saw local newscasts where they have armored
[50:27.040 --> 50:30.640]  vehicles and the police and say we need us to take on constitutional terrorists
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.920]  and that woke up the American people and the American people went and talked to
[50:34.920 --> 50:37.840]  local police departments they went talk to their sheriff's departments and now
[50:37.840 --> 50:43.920]  the majority of police in America we now know we're quietly rejecting this
[50:43.920 --> 50:49.360]  propaganda and rejecting this brainwashing right as we were warning
[50:49.360 --> 50:52.800]  about it but they really didn't wake up to it because we warned them that was
[50:52.800 --> 50:55.880]  only part of it a small part of it quite frankly we now know behind the scenes
[50:55.880 --> 50:59.240]  the police were actually really waking up in their own research because they saw
[50:59.240 --> 51:04.280]  the attempt to take them over so now as I've said the last ten years the police
[51:04.280 --> 51:07.720]  have become one of our biggest allies in understanding this because they see
[51:07.720 --> 51:12.240]  the attempted overthrow of legitimate US government from the federal right down
[51:12.240 --> 51:16.720]  the state level but particularly at the county sheriff and so as I saw them
[51:16.720 --> 51:22.240]  becoming really a bulwark that they needed to be against the tyranny the
[51:22.240 --> 51:25.480]  globalist figure that out and now instead of just trying to take them over
[51:25.480 --> 51:29.520]  from within they're trying to basically bankrupt them take their pensions make the
[51:29.520 --> 51:33.720]  good people quit and then come in with this new federal accreditation that
[51:33.720 --> 51:37.680]  senator tain was just talking about that's written by the United Nations
[51:37.680 --> 51:42.200]  and Loretta Lynch so it's an official plan and that's why it's important good
[51:42.200 --> 51:46.320]  police officers not resign that's why it's important that citizens support good
[51:46.320 --> 51:50.360]  policing and that's why we do reform particularly the blue states and blue
[51:50.360 --> 51:54.560]  cities that have the worst training that president Trump is now speaking out
[51:54.560 --> 51:59.400]  against so we're Americans we've all got issues and none of us are perfect but
[51:59.400 --> 52:04.400]  the globalist are collectively coming after our local government our system
[52:04.400 --> 52:07.920]  our constitution our bill of rights we need to protect it from out of control
[52:07.920 --> 52:11.640]  government if it's our government or it's the United Nations but particularly a
[52:11.640 --> 52:16.560]  foreign outside government and Americans have to recognize this across
[52:16.560 --> 52:21.360]  political racial and religious lines and come together and not be fools because
[52:21.360 --> 52:27.880]  the average leftist is too far gone but many people on the left really believe
[52:27.880 --> 52:33.960]  what they're doing classical liberals and if you just educate them they will
[52:33.960 --> 52:37.400]  wake up and see what's happening by simply pointing out that communist China
[52:37.400 --> 52:42.960]  is the operating system of the big tech surveillance of all of it and that
[52:42.960 --> 52:46.880]  communist China is the blueprint of what's now happening here today and what's
[52:46.880 --> 52:51.080]  being financed and we should reject it and embrace America and fix America
[52:51.080 --> 52:56.680]  ourselves and not be manipulated by this constellation of evil that the
[52:56.680 --> 53:01.640]  globalist system constitutes I'm Alex Jones info wars.com now back to the live
[53:01.640 --> 53:06.520]  transmission with Owen shroyer and our number two
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.440]  there are of course those who do not want us to speak you think just let me
[53:12.440 --> 53:16.840]  say even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns
[53:16.840 --> 53:22.960]  would be on their way because while the truncheon may be used
[53:22.960 --> 53:28.640]  lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words offer the
[53:28.640 --> 53:33.160]  means to meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation of the truth
[53:33.160 --> 53:38.840]  there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you
[53:38.840 --> 53:41.800]  designed it sir you wanted it to approve you told me every television in
[53:41.800 --> 53:46.960]  long cruelty and intolerance and aggression and where once you have the
[53:46.960 --> 53:51.680]  freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and
[53:51.680 --> 53:54.640]  systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and
[53:54.640 --> 54:00.480]  cameras in your submachine cameras how did this happen who's to blame well
[54:00.480 --> 54:04.240]  certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they will be held
[54:04.240 --> 54:09.280]  accountable but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need
[54:09.280 --> 54:15.920]  only look into a mirror I know why you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't
[54:15.920 --> 54:22.320]  be war terror disease there were a myriad of problems inspired to corrupt
[54:22.320 --> 54:27.840]  your reason and rob you of your common sense fear got the best of you and in
[54:27.840 --> 54:32.760]  your panic you turn to the now high chancellor Adam Sutler he promised you
[54:32.760 --> 54:37.000]  order he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.560]  obedient consent
[54:44.400 --> 54:50.120]  it's finally here introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray with
[54:50.120 --> 54:54.000]  true atomic iodine listeners have been asking us for months to develop an
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.360]  iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine after
[54:58.360 --> 55:01.720]  extensive development it's finally here our proprietary new aerodyne
[55:01.720 --> 55:05.720]  technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from
[55:05.720 --> 55:09.600]  7,000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula I have been
[55:09.600 --> 55:13.360]  using the new x2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.160]  of true nascent iodine working for my body I can personally feel the difference
[55:17.160 --> 55:21.320]  we know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as
[55:21.320 --> 55:25.840]  healthy metabolism healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive function iodine
[55:25.840 --> 55:29.360]  may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.800]  toxins get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of
[55:33.800 --> 55:38.520]  true nascent iodine today get the new survival shield x2 spray for 33% off
[55:38.520 --> 55:42.920]  and infowarstore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment that's
[55:42.920 --> 55:46.160]  infowarstore.com
[55:46.280 --> 55:51.000]  the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporate media and the
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.600]  chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're
[55:56.600 --> 55:59.880]  already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.520]  world but it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persist the
[56:05.520 --> 56:10.720]  worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth
[56:10.720 --> 56:14.280]  that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's
[56:14.280 --> 56:17.800]  important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the
[56:17.800 --> 56:21.840]  globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control
[56:21.840 --> 56:28.080]  they've admitted all of this so remember how does info wars continue years and
[56:28.080 --> 56:31.680]  decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.640]  because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes
[56:36.640 --> 56:40.720]  it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out
[56:40.720 --> 56:45.400]  is a thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's
[56:45.400 --> 56:47.880]  really happening
[56:47.880 --> 56:59.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[56:59.400 --> 57:05.640]  you're listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving
[57:05.640 --> 57:31.560]  this transmission you are the resistance and now your host olyn shroyer
[57:31.560 --> 57:37.400]  all right ladies and gentlemen we've got more from alex jones coming up and I'm
[57:37.400 --> 57:45.160]  gonna be smattering in the best of my ability what conservative or wartime
[57:45.160 --> 57:51.120]  conservatism means and how this needs to be the new face the new agenda the new
[57:51.120 --> 57:56.560]  strategy of the republican party and so I'm gonna be getting into that this hour
[57:56.560 --> 57:59.800]  taking your phone calls in the third hour and we'll be hearing from alex
[57:59.800 --> 58:06.560]  throughout this as well but so yesterday I got involved at a local level in a
[58:06.560 --> 58:12.120]  Travis precinct committee meeting and I took the message to this meeting which
[58:12.120 --> 58:19.520]  is now resonating on mainstream news channels and through through buck sexton
[58:19.520 --> 58:23.000]  and through josh howly we'll be hearing from them as well because they were
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.440]  saying this I don't talk to them so I took this message to local republican
[58:26.440 --> 58:31.080]  meeting last night not even realizing it was gonna go total mainstream today with
[58:31.080 --> 58:35.760]  howly and sexton but here it was myself last night at a local precinct
[58:35.760 --> 58:42.440]  meeting I'm a talk show host syndicated radio television I'm also an activist
[58:42.440 --> 58:46.680]  have actually been put in DC prison twice for my support of Donald Trump on
[58:46.680 --> 58:52.840]  the hill thank you thank you I want to thank Richard and Don for getting me out
[58:52.840 --> 58:57.040]  here and Matt and Andy and others as well and the reason why I'm here today
[58:57.040 --> 59:01.520]  is because if you're like me you believe that we're in a fight for our country
[59:01.520 --> 59:05.360]  right now and this is not a joke to me and I don't think it's a joke to you
[59:05.360 --> 59:10.520]  guys either I'll gladly offer my platform to Don and Mackenzie Jennifer we
[59:10.520 --> 59:13.840]  haven't met but you as well to help get you guys in office but I just want to
[59:13.840 --> 59:19.400]  ask you guys a couple questions as a pretense to how I think this party needs
[59:19.400 --> 59:23.720]  to move going forward okay does anybody out there believe that Donald Trump
[59:23.720 --> 59:29.040]  colluded with Russia no there's anybody out there believe Donald Trump is a
[59:29.040 --> 59:34.100]  racist no does anybody think Donald Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with
[59:34.100 --> 59:39.920]  Ukraine no does anyone think Jesse Smollett was a victim of a hate crime no
[59:39.920 --> 59:46.560]  no these are all games that the Democrats and the media play to stymie
[59:46.560 --> 59:50.960]  America and stymie Donald Trump and they're doing it again right now with
[59:50.960 --> 59:56.520]  coronavirus and I think that this Republican Party needs to be the
[59:56.520 --> 1:00:00.160]  Republican Party of the future which is the Trump Republican Party which doesn't
[1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:05.880]  sit here and say oh how can I have a convention with your rules no this
[1:00:05.880 --> 1:00:13.200]  Republican Party says we make the rules that's right we read the rules 300 years
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:17.400]  ago we have a bill of rights and if this Republican Party is talking about
[1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:21.640]  who's essential and who can go to school or a park or go to business well then
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:25.360]  what party is gonna protect our rights because it's definitely not going to be
[1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:30.120]  the Democrat Party so I think that this Republican Party moving forward needs
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:35.480]  to be battle hardened to protect America and to stand up for Donald Trump and not
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:39.720]  play games with the Democrats anymore these are obstacles they put in front
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:43.720]  of us it's time to smash through these obstacles and for this Republican Party
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:48.240]  to be fearless in 2020 fearless God bless you guys seriously thank you guys
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:54.200]  for letting me talk so there was a little bit before that a little bit after
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:58.440]  that just kind of chopping it up with some of the attendees but folks a
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:03.480]  message like that four years ago started to resonate widely ten years ago
[1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:07.920]  probably would have been booted right out of Republican Party politics today
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:15.920]  right now where we stand that message is the message that message resonates with
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:23.600]  almost 100% of Republican Party voters and so it's time for Republicans to
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:27.640]  stop cowering to the media stop playing games with the Democrats stop being
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:31.560]  afraid of their own shadow stop being afraid of their own thoughts and it's
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:36.680]  time to be the wartime conservative party the wartime Republican Party
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:40.320]  because we are in a war for this country right now and we have enemies
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:47.160]  domestic terror groups all being run by the Democrat Party who want to destroy
[1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:52.000]  America that message is not so crazy anymore that's mainstream messaging right
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:55.320]  there it's time for Republicans to catch up
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:05.360]  globalists have gotten away with their Russia gate hoax their Ukraine hoax their
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:14.360]  COVID-19 hoax and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020 we got to ask ourselves
[1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:18.440]  what's coming next I can tell you it's gonna be a bunch of big old fat mass
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:23.760]  shootings to create even a bigger race war to be economic collapse China
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:29.520]  invading Taiwan Hong Kong you name it the globalists are attacking on every
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:33.720]  front that's why now more than ever we have to realize they tried to censor
[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:37.640]  them floors off the air because they knew when they launched this whole
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:41.400]  situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air but
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:46.440]  thanks to you and our crew we are still on air so let's boost that
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:03:08.520]  transmission with the Batman signal now more than ever live from Austin Texas
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:19.760]  broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones we cannot continue to rely only on our
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:23.920]  military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:28.800]  we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:38.800]  just as strong just as well funded we have to make sure that as we listen to
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:42.120]  the community as we work with council to build out this department and as we
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:46.880]  continue to work under DOJ reform we've got to make sure that we are trying to
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:51.840]  do something meaningfully different than what we have been doing before and we
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:55.520]  have learned by testing out these different areas that this is really the
[1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:59.600]  culmination of work for a concept that is the first of its kind in Albuquerque
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:05.360]  and we believe actually nationwide and fundamentally what it says is this for
[1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:10.760]  a hundred years when you call 911 all across America their response is fire
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:16.880]  or police or both and we're adding a third response into that equation by
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:21.960]  developing a civilian professionally trained approach a public health approach
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:27.360]  really to public safety and that is embodied in our development of a
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:30.760]  department the community safety department that's where announcing here
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:35.040]  today that our administration is going to pursue the idea of creating this
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:39.360]  third department in our first responders system now through this
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:43.960]  department we're creating a new model for community safety that sends the right
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:49.560]  resource at the right time on the right call and that's where our current two
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:54.160]  departments have always struggled you have to send an overly trained person
[1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:57.400]  from one or the other to deal with situations we should really have others
[1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:01.800]  responding to so this is about having a trained but unarmed professional
[1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:06.080]  responding to calls for mental health for addiction for inebriation for
[1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:11.080]  homelessness for down and outs and even simple things like abandoned cars we
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:14.560]  spend an inordinate amount of time sending officers out to check on abandoned
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:18.720]  cars it also means simple things engaging the community like around traffic
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:24.960]  management and how we can do that again with an unarmed professional so inherent
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:29.520]  in this restructuring is also the question of what our city needs and it's
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:34.800]  the rejection of a false choice between investing in community and in a capable
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:39.160]  police department we know that in Albuquerque we have to respect the needed
[1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:44.320]  core police work that is that we need in our town but we also have to include the
[1:05:44.320 --> 1:05:48.840]  fact that we've got to prioritize non law enforcement alternatives when it comes
[1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:55.000]  to how we react in our 911 system into challenges in our city so in our city we
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:59.960]  must do both we are not accepting a choice between one or the other more
[1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:06.560]  than 10 years ago president Obama spilled the beans he told the world that
[1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:11.040]  America was going to have a domestic security force just as big and just as
[1:06:11.040 --> 1:06:16.920]  strong as the US military and who is that army well we've got training videos
[1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:24.080]  from Chicago from New York from Houston of the Obama Youth Brigades and the
[1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:31.520]  Obama Corps actually training and what was the training training people for
[1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:35.360]  socialism training people for communism training people for gun
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:40.520]  confiscation training people that after society collapses because of cloud and
[1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:47.720]  pivot bankruptcy strategies that then an army of social workers would then come
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:52.840]  out and reorganize the American people and that's in the United Nations strong
[1:06:52.840 --> 1:06:59.680]  cities initiative documents that will readily put into function in 2015 a
[1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:05.080]  year and a half before Obama left office in over 800 cities and towns in the
[1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:10.720]  United States a direct liaison with the United Nations telling local
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:16.600]  governments how to operate and what policies to have and now I have a stack
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:23.560]  of articles that are just out today here's one from Gateway Pundit here we
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:31.280]  go Albuquerque to start sending unarmed social workers on some 911 city calls
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:36.160]  Albuquerque's want to start sending unarmed social workers mayor Tim Keller
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:42.040]  announced the quote civilian public safety branch now you talk about secret
[1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:46.880]  police folks this is the liberals this is the left this is the woke folks that
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:50.320]  have been created on the university campuses that are full of tyranny this
[1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:55.720]  is chas this is chop expanding and coming to your town you can see the press
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:59.760]  conference again on info wars.com or Gateway Pundit.com I want to show you
[1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:05.080]  playing a clip of this coming up where he announces it this is extremely
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:10.600]  serious. Society is breaking down every time the police make a mistake or
[1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:14.520]  something goes wrong they're gonna be demonized it's gonna be magnified and
[1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:19.480]  then more UN control more communist control more Saul Lensky community
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:23.600]  organizing will be brought in until the police department is totally remade in
[1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:27.160]  their image now once the left takes control of the department like in
[1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:31.120]  Chicago it won't matter if there's 20 deaths a day as there are some days
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:35.160]  black-on-black they'll just sweep out of the rug the media won't cover it it
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:41.480]  won't exist but every time an officer who's white or black does something to
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:44.840]  a black person it's gonna be caught on tape it's gonna be released it's gonna
[1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:48.440]  be blown up and it's gonna be the end of the world so same thing with mass
[1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:52.160]  shootings they're still very very extremely rare for the rarest ways of
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:55.120]  dying in the United States but that doesn't matter every time there's a mass
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:59.440]  shooting it's blown up it's made to be huge and every gun owner is to blame
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:04.080]  every time a white cop kills a black person every white person is to blame
[1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:08.840]  this is the war on logic from the same people that tell you there aren't two
[1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:13.200]  genders from the same people that tell you no borders no walls no USA at all
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:16.720]  but they want borders and walls around their leftist systems at universities
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.760]  and places like chas and chop these people tell you to do one thing but
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:27.760]  they do the opposite it's classic 1984 George R. Well or Animal Farm so again
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:32.640]  this is the reality of where we are it's what we face as a society a united
[1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:36.880]  nation's takeover it's not coming ladies and gentlemen it's here and it's a leftist
[1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:42.200]  touchy feely bureaucracy but behind it is cold hardcore new world order
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:47.320]  enslavement corporate planetary fascism over communism for we the people I'm
[1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:50.800]  Alex Jones the only way this video and information gets out is if you share it
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:56.880]  info wars.com news wars.com tomorrow's news today
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:04.120]  ladies and gentlemen if the left and Democrats and their pandering and
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:12.720]  virtue signaling and social justice warring had any truth to it I think we
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:19.120]  know where they would be saying black lives matter but they're not so it took
[1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:25.120]  one individual with the courage to say the truth to a group of hospital
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:31.440]  workers taking a knee for BLM one black man decided to see if they really care
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:36.320]  about black lives here's how it went black lives killed by black men matter
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:40.640]  right yes hold on guys let's start this over black babies
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:44.720]  stop it started over so at the beginning we can hear them cheering
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:50.760]  matter or just some black lives the black lives killed by black men matter
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:58.560]  right yes the black babies killed in the abortions clinics matter right thought
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:04.080]  so the black the black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota that matters
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:08.840]  too right okay but the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:15.000]  don't matter do they are medical people our do their lives matter does the
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.840]  future of our black babies matter huh what's up what's up all for quiet now
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:27.880]  aren't they uh-huh it's okay if we kill them in the womb right but you have a
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:31.160]  problem when we you don't seem to really have a problem we kill them on the
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:36.400]  streets yes we know they're the same as issue if we don't if we don't respect
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:42.120]  the lives of our unborn children enough to save them and fight for them our
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:48.240]  lives mean nothing once we're born well we at info wars completely agree and
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:55.160]  that's why we have decided to launch the baby lives matter onesie and baby
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:12:03.000]  lives matter t-shirt at info wars store dot com and why is this so important why
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:06.440]  is this message so important well not only do you support the broadcast when
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:10.840]  you purchase the baby lives matter onesie or t-shirt you also fight back
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:15.160]  against the false narrative or false pandering that the left does when they
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:18.960]  say black lives matter but they ignore all the black on black violence they
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:22.440]  ignored the black police officers that get murdered and more importantly they
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:26.880]  ignore the tens of millions of black babies that get aborted but that's why
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:32.480]  the baby lives matter t-shirt is such art and such a perfect message for this
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:36.600]  time because are you gonna have people telling you that black lives matter but
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:41.440]  then ignore planned parenthood murdering tens of millions of black babies but
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:45.640]  just in general the fact that we abort our own children and then pretend to
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:51.440]  care about life anytime it works as a pandering to the democrat party virtue
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:56.440]  signal the people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:00.840]  movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries that's why the new
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:05.120]  world order is instituting race war in division and telling the people that
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:09.800]  rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and
[1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:15.840]  destroying essential services this is an attempt to have society collapse and
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:19.440]  the globalists as they've done in the third world will come in and pick up the
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:24.960]  pieces you must stand against the UN the IMF the World Bank and the EU openly
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:28.800]  saying the fund the police the police have a lot of problems we all have a lot
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:32.840]  of problems but this is our government and our local tabulary and believe me
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:36.800]  once the globalists have overthrown this country they're gonna put in a real
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:40.080]  police state where you have no due process or freedom the globalists believe
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:44.120]  communist China is the model of the world and they are orchestrating this
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:48.920]  entire thing the people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be

[1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:59.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:15.120]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:24.160]  to you live from the front lines of the info war last night the city of
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:30.360]  Beverly Hills took hypocrisy to a new level that's right the hollywood elite
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:35.120]  enclave that's been virtually signaling on Twitter and releasing YouTube videos
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:39.160]  calling for uprisings and occupying different parts of the United States
[1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:46.360]  past a unanimous resolution barring protests in the Beverly Hills area in
[1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:51.840]  any group of more than 10 people at one time and banning individuals from
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:58.040]  protesting overnight that's a form of curfew it's a form of martial law this
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:04.840]  is the very group that has been lockstep raising more than 30 million dollars the
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:09.080]  Democratic Party using George Floyd's name and now of course there's a whole
[1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:13.120]  new controversy about the fact that money is going to the Democrats there is no
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:19.040]  shame there is no bottom to these people they only want to take control of the
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:22.520]  government so they can continue to exploit the United States to build their
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:28.000]  new world order and the fact that they are now trying to quote abolish the
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.520]  police all over the United States and the Democratic Party is officially
[1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:37.080]  signing on to begin the quote abolishment of the police shows you that
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:40.520]  they're really just trying to take control of the police and that they're
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:43.920]  the ones that use the police to say that they need to beat people up and arrest
[1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:49.240]  them that don't stay six feet apart or wear the mask it's a cult and there's
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:52.080]  more hypocrisy of course hundred thousand people in New York for black
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:55.960]  lives matter the Democratic Party's new political system if you criticize them
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:00.280]  well most people are getting fired from radio shows TV shows you name it for
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:05.400]  even saying all lives matter this is complete cult programming but then when
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:09.720]  Trump tries to have a rally oh you can't do that you're gonna get people killed
[1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:14.960]  this is a suspension of logic and it's a cult that will do whatever they're told
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:18.360]  the followers don't care if they're hypocrites they don't care the Democrats
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:21.600]  want more wars they don't care of Trump's trying to turn the economy back on
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:24.600]  they don't care of big techs running death camps in China they don't care
[1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:27.040]  they're being surveilled they don't care of their schmucks they don't care of
[1:17:27.040 --> 1:17:30.120]  their losers they don't care and they're on the part of the power structure they
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:33.680]  just like to feel good and hate on America and hate on the middle class
[1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:37.320]  whether they're old young black or white because if you look at a leftist they
[1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:42.360]  are usually an ugly twisted depressed weird person and misery loves company and
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:47.120]  they want to pull this country down they are cancer they want power because they
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:50.160]  don't have power they want control because they don't have control of
[1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:56.280]  themselves the average leftist is a degenerate physically ugly person that
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:00.240]  stinks and has never had a real job in their life and they believe that they
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:04.200]  can just pull us down somehow that will make them higher that's what we're
[1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:08.360]  facing that's what we're dealing with back to live transmission with Owen
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:11.880]  Shroyer I'm Alex Jones on the road remember the only way to defeat the
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:15.760]  enemy in their censorship is for you to spread the live links this is an
[1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:22.800]  information war win by taking action lose by not taking it seriously you know
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:29.520]  I don't know what the leftist can understand this analogy but this is a
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:41.440]  warning I genuinely ache when I see my fellow man being deceived and brainwashed
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:52.800]  and tortured and drawn to Satanism but imagine what is the toughest thing about
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:19:02.640]  cancer that makes it so hard to cure or or to to beat well it's how do you isolate
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:07.160]  the cancer cells how do you isolate them how do you draw them out so that you
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:10.640]  can just go after them and not after the good cells and then just kill the
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:15.240]  entire body how do you isolate that how do you draw those cancer cells out well
[1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:20.760]  I'm not a doctor dealing with cancer here today but imagine that the left in
[1:19:20.760 --> 1:19:30.440]  America is a cancer which it is which it is and so the left in America is cancer
[1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:36.280]  to freedom and justice and everything that is righteous and good so how would
[1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:41.520]  you isolate that cancer how would you draw that cancer out if you wanted to
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:50.840]  say deal with it well again I hope that the average leftist understands this
[1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:59.520]  analogy you are the cancer you are being drawn out
[1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:04.320]  everyone knows you're the cancer everyone sees that you're the cancer
[1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:08.880]  you've now been isolated you now have ID'd yourself you've now made it
[1:20:08.880 --> 1:20:21.320]  possible to be eliminated so the difference is if you're the blood cell
[1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:30.840]  you can make the conscious decision not to be cancer but the longer this goes on
[1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:37.280]  the more you commit to being a cancer on society the more you isolate and ID
[1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:45.320]  yourself the higher the odds are that you're gonna get what it is you're
[1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:54.560]  asking for and if you're just out there thinking hey I'm gonna have a good time
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:59.240]  and I'm gonna loot and riot and you know the establishment's corrupt anyway
[1:20:59.240 --> 1:21:03.720]  well you've been fooled because you're doing exactly what the establishment
[1:21:03.720 --> 1:21:09.800]  wants you to do now this is breaking news right here and I'm gonna get into
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:13.480]  wartime conservatism coming up on the other side this is breaking news right
[1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:20.400]  here out of Florida 17 arrested for child pornography include Disney
[1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:26.720]  employees nurse underwear and Jester Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd that's the
[1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:32.520]  same guy you said if a criminal comes in your house to blow them back Sheriff
[1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:37.240]  Grady Judd detailed the arrests and charges of 17 suspects including Disney
[1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:40.600]  and hospital employees accused of downloading or distributing child
[1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:47.920]  pornography pornography featuring children as young as a few months old
[1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:52.720]  deputy to say the child pornography included thousands of photos and videos
[1:21:52.720 --> 1:22:03.000]  depicting babies toddlers and children being forced to engage in sex acts breaks
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:17.480]  my heart toddlers toddlers how in the hell does that happen so now you had
[1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:22.880]  mass pedophile rings rounded up in Florida and California and other states
[1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:31.640]  barely gets any news coverage by the way most of these are white men so you know
[1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:35.440]  for the white hate white men media why aren't they all over this story are they
[1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:42.680]  covering something up I wonder how many people on mainstream news maybe watch
[1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:47.600]  some of this stuff these are sick people we're talking about on TV would you
[1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:52.960]  really be that surprised why else wouldn't they be covering this they hate
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:23:01.480]  white men most of these are white men they never covered the other mass
[1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:06.360]  roundup of pedophiles that kids in cages they never covered the one in
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:10.360]  California they never covered any of it they never covered the sex drug dungeon
[1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:18.720]  of Ed Buck you think you're gonna see this anywhere if you're gonna see this
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:22.480]  story right here anywhere on TV you'll see it on Tucker Carlson that's it but
[1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:26.400]  you but you probably won't not even the Tucker was not covering it or not trying
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:30.640]  to cover it but he just probably won't be able to fit it into his one hour but
[1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:35.440]  this is about the scum of the earth right here it's about as bad as it gets
[1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:41.200]  right here doesn't get any lower than this children being raped and tortured
[1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:46.680]  for the viewing pleasure of others and it's not top news today it's not on TV

[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:31.040]  gates it was listeners idea asking for us come up with a spray bottle that had
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:34.080]  us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:38.040]  aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:43.040]  better way get your survival shield x2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:48.520]  at infowarstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized x2 nascent iodine
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:53.560]  for yourself let's go to one in Connecticut you're on the air thanks

[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.840]  powder there is so this this was designed on one of the top guys in the
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:38.560]  country he didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:41.200]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:44.960]  it and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:47.760]  there and you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot to
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:51.600]  me thank you to all your truck drivers we love you
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:27:00.560]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:14.320]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with
[1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:22.080]  Owen Troyer for the next two segments I am going to explain to you the concept
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:30.240]  the name dubbed by Buck Sexton former CIA now does coverage for Fox News and his
[1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:37.600]  own Buck Sexton show no not dr. anal sex the the anti-american CIA that they're
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:43.520]  posing as Floyd's former teacher this is the good Buck Sexton who is calling it
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:48.080]  out for what it really is and he has an excellent piece right now at bucksexton.com
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:51.520]  it's time to rally around the concept of wartime conservatism this is going
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:57.600]  mainstream this is gaining momentum and I'll get into the ins and outs of the
[1:27:57.600 --> 1:28:00.960]  story in a little bit but first folks I didn't know he was going to write this
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:04.000]  story I didn't know Josh Howley was going to give this speech today but I'm
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.560]  telling you Republicans and conservatives are getting it now and so here's me
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:12.640]  talking at a local Republican precinct committee meeting last night and then
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:19.680]  Josh Howley on Capitol Hill this morning. I'm a talk show host syndicated radio
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:24.480]  television I'm also an activist I've actually been put in DC prison twice
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:30.400]  for my support of Donald Trump on the Hill thank you thank you I want to thank
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:34.560]  Richard and Don for getting me out here and Matt and Andy and others as well
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:38.960]  and the reason why I'm here today is because if you're like me you believe
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:43.600]  that we're in a fight for our country right now and this is not a joke to me
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:48.160]  and I don't think it's a joke to you guys either I'll gladly offer my platform to
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:52.080]  Don and Mackenzie Jennifer we haven't met but you as well to help get you guys
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.120]  in office but I just want to ask you guys a couple questions
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:29:01.040]  as a pretense to how I think this party needs to move going forward okay
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:05.120]  does anybody out there believe that Donald Trump colluded with Russia
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:10.560]  no does anybody out there believe Donald Trump is a racist
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:15.040]  does anybody think Donald Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine
[1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:19.120]  does anyone think Jesse Smallette was a victim of a hate crime
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:25.280]  no no these are all games that the Democrats and the media play
[1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:30.000]  to stymie america and stymie donald trump and they're doing it again right
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.600]  now with coronavirus and I think that this
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:37.760]  republican party needs to be the republican party of the future which
[1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:40.800]  is the trump republican party which doesn't sit here and say
[1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:44.800]  oh how can I have a convention with your rules
[1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:51.760]  no this republican party says we make the rules that's right we rip the rules
[1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:56.640]  300 years ago we have a bill of rights and if this republican party is talking
[1:29:56.640 --> 1:30:00.720]  about who's essential and who can go to school or a park or go to business
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:03.440]  well then what party is going to protect our rights
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:06.640]  because it's definitely not going to be the democrat party that's right so I
[1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:10.000]  think that this republican party moving forward needs to be
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:14.960]  battle hardened to protect america and to stand up for donald trump and not
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:17.920]  play games with the democrats anymore these are
[1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:20.960]  obstacles they put in front of us it's time to smash through these
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:24.560]  obstacles and for this republican party to be fearless
[1:30:24.560 --> 1:30:30.000]  in 2020 fearless god bless you guys seriously thank you guys for letting me talk
[1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:39.040]  if this case makes anything clear
[1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:43.680]  it is that the bargain that has been offered to religious conservatives
[1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:50.000]  for years now is a bad one it's time to reject it the bargain
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:54.720]  has never been necessarily explicitly articulated but religious conservatives
[1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:59.360]  know what it is the bargain is that you go along with
[1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:03.680]  the party establishment you support their policies and priorities or at least
[1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:06.720]  keep your mouth shut about it and in return the establishment
[1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:10.480]  will put some judges on the bench who supposedly will protect your
[1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:13.440]  constitutional rights to freedom of worship to freedom
[1:31:13.440 --> 1:31:16.880]  of exercise that's been what we've were told
[1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:21.920]  for years now and we were told that we're supposed to shut up while the
[1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:25.520]  party establishment focuses more on cutting taxes and handing out
[1:31:25.520 --> 1:31:28.720]  favors for corporations multinational corporations who
[1:31:28.720 --> 1:31:31.440]  don't share our values who will not stand up for american
[1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:34.880]  principles who are only too happy to ship american jobs overseas
[1:31:34.880 --> 1:31:38.640]  but we're supposed to say nothing about that we're supposed to keep our mouths
[1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:42.800]  shut because maybe we'll get a judge out of the deal
[1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:46.640]  that was the implicit bargain we're supposed to keep our mouths shut
[1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:50.880]  while the party establishment opens borders while the party establishment
[1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:56.080]  pursues ruinous trade policies we're supposed to keep our mouths shut
[1:31:56.080 --> 1:31:59.760]  while those at the upper end of the income bracket get all of the attention
[1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:04.080]  while working families and college students
[1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:07.200]  and those who don't want to go to college but can't get a good job while
[1:32:07.200 --> 1:32:13.280]  they get what what attention workers children what about parents
[1:32:13.280 --> 1:32:17.200]  looking for help with the cost of raising children looking for help with the
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:19.920]  culture in which they have to raise children looking for help with the
[1:32:19.920 --> 1:32:23.360]  communities rebuilding the communities in which they must carry out
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:28.080]  their family life what about college students trying to find an education
[1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:31.600]  that isn't ruinously expensive and then figure out some way to pay back
[1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:34.720]  that ruinous debt what about those who don't have a college degree and don't
[1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:38.720]  want one but like to get a good job what about them
[1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:43.440]  now we're supposed to stay quiet about all of that
[1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:49.440]  and more because there'd be pro-constitution religious liberty
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:54.960]  judges except that there aren't except for that these judges
[1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:58.720]  don't follow the constitution except for these judges invoke
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:03.760]  textualism and originalism in order to reach their preferred outcome now i want
[1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:08.560]  to be clear i am not personally criticizing any justice
[1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:11.600]  who joined the majority opinion or wrote it i i believe
[1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:15.280]  100 percent that the justice is the justice who principally offered this
[1:33:15.280 --> 1:33:20.480]  opinion justice gorsuch and those who joined him are sincere
[1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:24.560]  and who were writing to the best of their ability reasoning to the best of
[1:33:24.560 --> 1:33:29.120]  their ability and and the opinion is it is uh whatever else you might say
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:32.080]  about it it is not sloppily reasoned
[1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:35.920]  now i think that they were doing what they thought was best and using all of
[1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:40.400]  the skills and and gifts that they had no i question how we got here
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:43.760]  i question how judges who hold to this philosophy
[1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:47.920]  ended up on that bench i question the bargain
[1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:51.760]  that people of faith have been offered
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:55.360]  and asked to hold to for all of these years
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:58.960]  and the truth is to those who said who have objected
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:02.880]  to my own questioning of judicial nominees in this body
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:06.480]  to those who said i was wrong to question judges who came for the judiciary
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:10.240]  committee to those who chided me for asking tough questions
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:14.400]  even of nominees by a republican president for those who said that i was
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:17.840]  slowing the process down and i was out of line for the supposedly
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:22.400]  conservative groups who threatened to buy television time in my own state
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:26.800]  to punish me for asking questions about conservative judges
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:31.600]  i just have this to say this is why i ask questions
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:35.040]  this is why i won't stop and i wish some more people
[1:34:35.040 --> 1:34:42.000]  would ask some harder questions because this outcome is not acceptable
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:48.480]  and the bargain which religious conservatives have been offered is not tenable
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:52.720]  so i would just say it's not time for religious conservatives to shut up
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:56.160]  now we've done that for too long no it's time for religious conservatives to
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:59.920]  stand up and to speak out it's time for religious
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:03.600]  conservatives to bring forward the best of our ideas on every policy
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:06.640]  affecting this nation we should be out in the forefront
[1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:13.680]  leading on economics on trade on race on class on every subject that matters for
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:16.880]  what our founders called the general welfare
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:20.240]  because we have a lot to offer not just to protect our own rights
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:23.840]  but for the good of all of our fellow citizens because as religious believers
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:27.280]  we know that serving our fellow citizens of
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:30.000]  whatever their religious faith whatever their commitments may be
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.880]  serving them aiding them working for them is one of the signature ways that we
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:38.880]  show a love of neighbor it's time for religious conservatives to do that
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:42.800]  it's time for religious conservatives to take the lead rather than being pushed
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:46.320]  to the back it's time for religious conservatives to stand up and speak out
[1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:50.800]  rather than being told to sit down and shut up
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:55.440]  and because i am confident that people of faith of goodwill all across this
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:35:59.360]  country are ready to do that and want to do that and have
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:02.800]  something to offer this country and every person in this country
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:06.720]  whatever their background or income or race or religion because of that i'm
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:10.480]  confident in the future i'm also confident
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:16.720]  that the old ways will not do so let this be a departure let this be a new
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:20.320]  beginning let this be the start of something better
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:23.920]  josh howley thank god for the senator from
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:28.080]  missouri by the way missouri had a christian conservative governor
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:33.520]  christians literally got set up by the fbi they forced him out of office so
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:36.880]  this is the battle folks now i'm gonna get more into this some
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:40.320]  republicans are understanding that the new conservative platform
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:44.080]  needs to be we're fighting a war for america right now
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:46.960]  so we'll get into that on the other side and i'll give out the phone number
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:50.160]  this is the alex joneshow
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:54.320]  the united states is not communist china we don't have three million people in
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:57.520]  concentration camps we don't blow up churches
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:00.720]  we don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs
[1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:04.320]  but all over the news we see the u n billable indicates
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:07.920]  w h o mainstream corporate media praising
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:11.920]  communist china for their response and if communist china shoots women at
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:16.000]  checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.760]  well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like san antonio
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:23.280]  pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:26.480]  well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:29.600]  these people are out of control control freaks
[1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:33.360]  and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:36.880]  criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:40.960]  the resistance lives at bandot video and in full wars dot com
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:44.080]  spread those links and jam it down the censors throats
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:48.960]  and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:53.280]  it's finally here introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:56.800]  with true atomic iodine listeners have been asking us for months
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:00.720]  to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:03.520]  iodine after extensive development it's finally here
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:07.680]  our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:10.960]  ancient iodine crystals from 7 000 feet below the earth's surface
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:14.800]  into an ultimate spray formula i have been using the new x2 spray every day
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:18.240]  and i feel good knowing that i have the power of true nascent iodine working
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:20.640]  for my body i can personally feel the difference
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:24.080]  we know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:28.240]  as well as healthy metabolism healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:30.640]  function iodine may also support your body and

[1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:26.800]  and now your host owin shroyer your time conservatism
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:30.320]  is what it's being branded
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:36.560]  and some republicans are getting it others are still afraid of their own
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:40.320]  shadow not even realizing this is what america
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:46.480]  wants this is what america needs and so buck sexton a former cia
[1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:50.320]  agent who has a buck sexton show and goes on fox news regularly
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:53.680]  wrote this piece at buck sexton dot com
[1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:56.720]  it's time to rally around the concept of wartime
[1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:04.960]  conservatism and it really all boils down to the fact
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:08.720]  that the left is an award to destroy america right now
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:13.520]  and if conservatives and republicans don't
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:18.080]  take that mantle enter that battlefield to save and protect america
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:23.840]  then america will die so republicans either get battle hardened and realize
[1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:26.800]  the war ahead or they will go down with the rest
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:29.440]  of this country that will be destroyed by the democrats
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:36.400]  and the left and so you heard me saying this to local republicans
[1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:40.720]  last night you heard josh howley saying this on the floor
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:46.880]  of the hill today here's another example of how you do this
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:51.600]  steve scholes demands answers from democrat governors on forcing covet
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:57.280]  patients into nursing homes which resulted in 50
[1:42:57.280 --> 1:43:02.160]  thousand nursing home deaths
[1:43:02.160 --> 1:43:08.560]  steve scholes is on the right path steve scholes is a wartime
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:14.880]  conservative steve scholes is hitting the democrats where it
[1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:21.520]  hurts their agenda which was premeditated murdering
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:26.160]  thousands of innocent elderly people in nursing homes so that they could have
[1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:29.760]  their pandemic and shut down the economy and blame
[1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:35.120]  donald trump and i remember reporting on this i believe before anybody else
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:38.880]  these democrats whitmer qualmo and the rest
[1:43:38.880 --> 1:43:42.000]  need to be in jail for the rest of their life maybe even face the death
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.320]  penalty
[1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:49.360]  you know you could be mad at oan schroyer for saying that you can say
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:52.400]  that's extremo and how dare you this doesn't help anything
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:55.600]  no folks it's the truth
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:43:59.680]  you know it's sad that andrew qualmo and
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:04.720]  gretchen whitmer and the rest of them made that decision
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:11.680]  laden that bed but they did it they're now mass murderers serial
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:17.680]  serial killers they chose that and so they need to be treated as
[1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:21.520]  such so
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:28.080]  if we have a wartime republican party if we have wartime conservatives and we
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:31.200]  really understand this issue
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:34.960]  andrew qualmo and gretchen which whitmer and others will face the death
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:38.000]  penalty for what they did in these nursing homes
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:42.080]  folks i'm not happy about that that doesn't make me happy that makes me
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:47.040]  tremendously upset and sad that americans would do this
[1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:51.920]  that our political leaders are that corrupt and that
[1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:56.560]  but they are and we have to start dealing with them folks
[1:44:56.560 --> 1:44:59.840]  or it's only going to get worse and just like josh howley said
[1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:04.720]  it's time for christian conservatives to to stand up and have their voices heard
[1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:07.840]  because for far too long christian conservatives have been told to sit down
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:10.960]  and shut up no it's time to stand up and it's time to get
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:16.560]  loud and realize that we are the silent majority it's time to be the loud
[1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:20.400]  majority and it's time to make an example
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:23.840]  you think you can send covid patients into nursing homes to raise the death
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:27.040]  rate and then blame trump and fake a pandemic so you
[1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:28.960]  can shut down the economy and hurt america
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:32.800]  you know what we're gonna give you the death penalty
[1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:38.080]  we're not going to stand for that in this country anymore so i'm sorry to say
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:42.080]  qualmo and whitmer and the rest of them you chose this not me
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:46.240]  not me you chose this don't be mad at me
[1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:49.200]  for saying that you deserve the death penalty andrew qualmo
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:59.200]  you do you chose that qualmo not me you chose to make it legal to murder
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:03.040]  babies after they're born you chose that qualmo
[1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:07.040]  and guess what you deserve the death penalty
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:10.400]  and so do the rest of the governors that did this you
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:16.640]  chose that destiny you chose that destiny
[1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:20.720]  and if my destiny is to call you out for it and then watch you hang
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:25.760]  well then you know what i have no qualms with that
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:29.920]  you sent those patients you sent covid into the nursing homes
[1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:34.400]  it resulted in at least 50 000 dead you did that qualmo
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:38.400]  you did that whitmer you did that northam you did that
[1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:43.760]  you chose to be murderers you made that conscious choice didn't you
[1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:47.680]  and you didn't think we'd notice and you know now
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:52.080]  oh well they found out but oh don't worry republicans and conservatives are
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:56.880]  weak they'll never stand up to us we're coming for you
[1:46:56.880 --> 1:47:00.560]  and all those innocent babies you murdered and all those elderly people
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:05.360]  you murdered with covid if we don't get justice for them here on this earth
[1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:10.000]  oh believe me the justice you get after this life will be much worse in fact
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:13.760]  you in fact qualmo and whitmer and the rest of them
[1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:17.200]  you better pray to god or even turn yourself in for what you did
[1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:20.880]  because that's the only chance you have of not receiving
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:26.400]  god's wrath for the rest of your consciousness
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:32.560]  in the afterlife good luck ted cruise gets it though
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:37.920]  ted cruise gets it sesame street puts out a gay pride month
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:41.120]  propaganda because you know it's all about sexualizing the kids
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:44.080]  because i remember growing up uh you know sesame street taught me how to be
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.840]  straight oh wait no it didn't now sesame street teaches you how to
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:50.880]  be gay ted cruise gets it he replies to this tweet
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:54.720]  from sesame street promoting homosexuality to kids

[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:02.960]  at pre-k children it doesn't need to be talking about sex or sexuality at all
[1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:12.480]  that's wartime conservatism that's the new republican party that we need
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:17.040]  this is not and i'll be honest folks i've always been a supporter of greg abbott
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:21.360]  and i've and i've remained uh from from saying anything negative about him

[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:30.720]  governor abbott's popularity in texas is waning big time
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:35.840]  big time in fact he may not win another election
[1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:40.880]  texas governor greg abbott scolds 20-somethings for not wearing masks

[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:49.440]  folks so who knows what the truth is about
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:53.600]  this if it's deadly if it's even real at all
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:57.040]  but they're getting ready to shut down the economy again
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:00.640]  and they're going to blame coronavirus or they'll make some other thing up and
[1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:04.960]  then they'll tell you that you have to constantly spray poisonous chemicals
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:08.480]  on yourself to sanitize and your surfaces to sanitize which will give you
[1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:13.120]  cancer and it will force you to sign on to
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:17.840]  an app that will track and trace your location 24-7
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:20.960]  which they're already doing they just needed you to sign on to it and they
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:24.640]  needed the reasoning to do it so this is all coming folks so
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:27.920]  and the left is going to fully endorse all of it they'll be behind it so
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:32.160]  the conservatives and republicans better uh
[1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:35.840]  you know they better start to uh stand up
[1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:39.520]  and get strong because uh it's not going to be pretty if we allow the left
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:43.200]  and the democrats to get away with this folks
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:46.480]  and uh it's either a political revolution now
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:49.520]  or we're gonna have to fight for this country physically
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:54.400]  um probably next year i would say at this rate
[1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:57.680]  maybe even before that depending on how bad the democrats get
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:01.360]  between now and then i want to take your phone calls here for the rest
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:07.440]  of this hour and then we have a special report coming up with david night
[1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:10.960]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:15.520]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:19.440]  anything that we've covered today is fair game
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:25.040]  wartime conservatism how about i mean again folks this is like
[1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:29.040]  crazy but the stories at info words dot com
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:32.880]  german authorities placed homeless children with known pedophiles for 30
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:37.520]  years it's so corrupt
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:42.160]  in florida 17 arrested for child pornography including disney employees
[1:56:42.160 --> 1:56:45.680]  nurse underwear and jester
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:51.120]  why would the mainstream news be covering up the arrest of 17
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:56.640]  child rapists most were white by the way so the hate-winding media you think
[1:56:56.640 --> 1:57:01.680]  would be all over this so what does it tell you
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:06.080]  that the hate-white media
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:12.880]  ignores white child rapists and i bet you i bet you the toddlers were
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:18.080]  probably a lot of them were probably minorities folks
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:22.080]  i mean where do you think i mean they're getting these kids from Haiti
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:28.400]  so
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:31.920]  i'm sorry it's just so sick
[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:37.120]  i just can't believe this man laura sillsby gets caught trafficking
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:41.920]  children across the Haitian border now she runs the amber alert program
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:46.880]  i mean folks we're gonna be judged by god
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:50.880]  but let me tell you if we don't fight for this stuff right now if we don't fight
[1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:56.000]  these people these child rapists these deceivers of humanity now i mean god
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:00.960]  is going to judge us too and we may not go to hell
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:06.960]  but uh we're not going to have a seat in the front row of heaven
[1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:11.280]  because this is uh i mean again you've got tens of thousands of people
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:14.960]  marching for black trans lives what a joke but
[1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:19.520]  governor Cuomo gets to murder thousands of people in a nursing home
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:23.920]  pedophiles in florida get to rape children and no mark no protest but
[1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:27.600]  think about it think about the hate whitey media
[1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:30.720]  that has a perfect opportunity to show you the faces of some of the most
[1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:34.720]  evil wicked disgusting men on the face of the earth mostly white raping children
[1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:39.760]  and they don't do it that tells you that protecting pedophiles
[1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:44.400]  is a bigger agenda in the media than get whitey which you're seeing is a huge
[1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:47.680]  agenda but think about that they'd rather protect pedophiles
[1:58:47.680 --> 1:58:54.960]  aerodyne technology delivery system the first of its kind pure nascent atomic
[1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:59.280]  iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle the next level of
[1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:03.120]  innovation of x2 is here introducing survival shield
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:06.960]  x2 spray the great part about the x2 spray is it's great

[1:59:19.360 --> 1:59:22.560]  not to just ingest it into the stomach and we're really excited about it
[1:59:22.560 --> 1:59:26.240]  it's 33 off out of the gates it was listeners idea
[1:59:26.240 --> 1:59:29.840]  asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists
[1:59:29.840 --> 1:59:33.040]  and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and
[1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:36.720]  delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way
[1:59:36.720 --> 1:59:41.040]  get your survival shield x2 nascent iodine spray now at 33 off
[1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:45.200]  and infowarstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized

[1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:03.520]  olyn shroyer all right we're getting your calls aggregated right now
[2:00:03.520 --> 2:00:07.440]  we'll be going to your calls for the rest of this hour ladies and gentlemen
[2:00:07.440 --> 2:00:14.400]  it is at infowarstore.com it is here baby lives matter onesie
[2:00:14.400 --> 2:00:18.560]  baby lives matter t-shirt you know i love this thing so much i just may go make a
[2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:25.440]  baby just so i can have one just so i can put the baby lives matter onesie
[2:00:25.440 --> 2:00:29.760]  because see the left sits here all day long with their propaganda
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:37.280]  that has no bounds in in truth or reality at all
[2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:40.240]  black lives matter you ignore black on black crime
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:43.280]  in the city you ignore all the black police officers that get hunted down
[2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:46.800]  and murdered you ignore the tens of millions of black babies by the way
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:50.480]  i mean it's more dangerous in america like we have all these statistics at
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:54.000]  infowarstore.com by the way the truth about crime statistics revealed
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:57.760]  in america if you're black the odds of you being killed in the womb
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:00.240]  are higher than being killed by a police officer
[2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:03.680]  the odds of you being killed by another black man are higher than you being
[2:01:03.680 --> 2:01:07.920]  killed by a police officer but none of that matters
[2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:11.200]  none of that matters because the democrat party has to fundraise
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:15.200]  and in order to fundraise they have to lie to their voters and deceive them
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:18.880]  into thinking they're oppressed victims so that you give them money to help the
[2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:21.680]  problem that they've been claiming that they're going to fix for 50 years when
[2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:24.320]  the truth is they're actually behind all of it
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:28.560]  like Colin Kaepernick. Colin Kaepernick is a rich white man pretending to be an
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:31.440]  oppressed black man
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:37.920]  and he's all paid for by communist china with nike as the front company
[2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:42.400]  so we fight against that propaganda we give you the opportunity to
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:45.920]  fight against that propaganda baby lives matter onesy put it on
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:49.360]  your baby baby lives matter t-shirt put it on your
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:52.560]  kid and then when someone questions you or says you're insensitive
[2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:56.480]  you stand up and you say really so you like
[2:01:56.480 --> 2:02:00.560]  50 million black babies being aborted in america
[2:02:00.560 --> 2:02:04.720]  you realize that it's more dangerous for a black american
[2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:07.920]  the odds are greater that they'll be killed by a
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:11.360]  fellow black american or that they will be killed in the womb do you realize
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:16.960]  that and then watch them squirm no folks it's
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:19.440]  you know what
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:24.240]  we're going to really have to change our mindset
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:28.800]  heading into this election because we i understand people don't like putting
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:32.240]  people in uncomfortable positions they don't like being the agitator or the
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:37.680]  aggressor but folks now is the time i'm telling you
[2:02:37.680 --> 2:02:41.760]  it's it's it's time to start psychologically torturing leftists
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:47.520]  with facts that's all it is that's all you have to do
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:50.800]  wear your baby lives matter t-shirt take your baby out someone wants to harass
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:54.800]  you you tell them the facts you make them own
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:58.800]  their ignorance you say black lives matter do they
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:01.760]  hey that's insensitive you're mocking black lives matter you say oh black
[2:03:01.760 --> 2:03:03.920]  lives matter they say yeah black lives matter you say
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:07.680]  oh what did you do about the 50 million black babies aborted
[2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:10.880]  well that's different oh okay what did you about the black cops that are
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:14.800]  murdered in cold blood by black lives matter well
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:17.200]  see because they never show this on the news so they don't think it exists but
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:21.360]  they know it's all true we're all connected in this consciousness
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:25.440]  so we're constantly sending and receiving information even if we're not
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:30.240]  getting it so they know it's all true they know black on black crime in the
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:33.200]  in the city is is the biggest crime you can find
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:36.480]  they know that the odds are if you're black it's it's it's a lot higher odds
[2:03:36.480 --> 2:03:38.960]  that you'll be killed by a black person or killed in the womb
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:44.000]  than killed by a cop they know all that but the truth doesn't help them fundraise
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.280]  the truth doesn't get them to the next level of their political
[2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:52.560]  political power so it's time for you to own this
[2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:56.560]  and psychologically torture leftists when they want to
[2:03:56.560 --> 2:03:59.840]  come at you for wearing a baby lives matter shirt

[2:05:49.360 --> 2:05:52.640]  driven by the media but it's not just black on white i mean if you're a black
[2:05:52.640 --> 2:05:56.000]  individual that doesn't go along with the propaganda they beat your ass too
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:59.680]  there's another video we got this i i don't have much context but it's this
[2:05:59.680 --> 2:06:03.760]  woman standing up to clearly some agitated black
[2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:06.800]  man who who thinks that violence is the answer
[2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:10.560]  because that's what he's been taught by the democrats he'll end up in jail
[2:06:10.560 --> 2:06:15.920]  and he takes a skateboard and whips a woman in the head with it
[2:06:15.920 --> 2:06:20.560]  that's attempted murder this guy should be in jail for 50 years
[2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:26.240]  but because of uh the way black people are treated now and they have all
[2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:29.600]  these protections with the acl you and all the stuff this guy probably won't
[2:06:29.600 --> 2:06:33.920]  see a second in jail for this attempted murder right here
[2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:39.440]  and that's a black lady yeah oh yeah it's definitely but find that video i was
[2:06:39.440 --> 2:06:43.360]  talking about blue lives matter dot blue and find that video it's absolutely
[2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:46.480]  well we're searching for now there's another video of a guy who claims this
[2:06:46.480 --> 2:06:50.080]  guy called him uh or said the n-word there's no proof that he just made it
[2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:51.920]  up he just wanted a reason to beat this white guy
[2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:56.240]  senseless in the middle of the mall and so and so look this is all being driven
[2:06:56.240 --> 2:07:01.680]  by the media and and then conservatives or or anybody is too afraid to call it
[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:05.440]  out for what it is and so then it just continues
[2:07:05.440 --> 2:07:07.680]  and so i don't know if they're having trouble finding this video or they found
[2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:10.960]  it but uh but yeah there's no doubt this is all being driven
[2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:14.560]  the democrats the media they're trying to start race riots
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:18.400]  and they're they're actually bringing racism back they're literally single
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:21.440]  handedly destroying martin luther king's dream
[2:07:21.440 --> 2:07:25.920]  really have you seen the the actual movie b for vendetta that you guys did the
[2:07:25.920 --> 2:07:28.240]  commercial on it have you personally seen it
[2:07:28.240 --> 2:07:32.720]  yes have you heard of the group anonymous on twitter they have like eight
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:36.800]  million uh yeah followers and they think they're
[2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:40.480]  they think that they are on the side of freedom when actually they're on the
[2:07:40.480 --> 2:07:43.680]  side of tyranny and they're well here's the thing about anonymous and
[2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:46.000]  anything anonymous is why i always tell the q people
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:50.080]  anything anonymous can always be hijacked and you'll never know it
[2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:54.320]  exactly exactly so so maybe that happened jeff i got a jump thank you for
[2:07:54.320 --> 2:07:58.720]  the call eric in ohio go ahead eric
[2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:04.000]  you don't know good thank you i just want to start off by thanking

[2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:23.520]  them years where alex jones was getting on george bush when he was president
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:27.200]  oh yeah and how we've been anti-war anti-war on drugs
[2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:31.440]  anti-militarized police yeah it's it's it's all propaganda
[2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:35.520]  you know now everybody sees through this coronavirus that i talk to they see
[2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:40.320]  through the black lives matter movement i've been sharing your videos and
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:43.840]  getting the word out there but just the fact that everybody can see through the
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:47.760]  crap that they're trying to do just you know it goes to show you well and you
[2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:52.240]  know here's my judgment of that too eric it's not because we see through it
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:56.560]  i genuinely believe now that the left knows it i don't even think they're
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:00.000]  being fooled by it they just like playing along with it they just are
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:03.760]  driven by hate so even they they know it's all a front and all a lie
[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:08.240]  they go along with it because they hate you and they know that it bothers you
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:11.520]  oh well they're just hoping that we're all done and we hope you know they
[2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:15.760]  know we forget things we are a forgetful species being humans that we are
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:19.120]  and they just hope that we forget all the nonsense that they say or
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:22.480]  that they do you know they say one thing and then do another
[2:09:22.480 --> 2:09:25.120]  it's their policy and so they're getting ready to roll up another
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:29.040]  covid 19 hoax i'm telling you and folks they're lying in the media
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:35.360]  oh 600 new cases isn't it folks they're testing literally everyone and then
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:39.520]  they get the test results back in one fell swoop from tens of thousands of
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:41.840]  tests so of course the numbers are going to spike
[2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:47.040]  it's all a game it's all a game folks
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:55.600]  globalists have gotten away with their russia gate hoax
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:59.200]  their ukraine hoax their covid 19 hoax and now
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:06.800]  it's the race riot hoax of 2020 we've got to ask ourselves what's coming next
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:10.960]  well i can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:16.720]  to create even a bigger race war to the economic collapse china invading taiwan
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:22.720]  hong kong you name it the globalists are attacking on every front that's why now
[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:26.640]  more than ever we have to realize they tried to censor inforores off the air

[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:33.440]  hey owen you got anybody loud and clear
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:36.960]  hey man i'm just calling uh to tell you i love the whole
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:42.480]  uh wartime conservative idea man i'm i'm glad buck sexton is hitting on us
[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:46.880]  because i don't understand where the republicans are you know um
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:50.880]  that they're basically are democrats to me at this point in a lot of ways
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:54.000]  um i'll argue with is being my republican friends about
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:58.160]  the republicans not doing anything as i do with a lot of my democrat friends you
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:01.440]  know i mean um you know we got lindsay
[2:13:01.440 --> 2:13:05.040]  Graham who's obviously you know a democrat
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:07.840]  who's basically running everything for this in the senate right now you're not
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:10.320]  going to get that done with him oh i don't trust lindsay
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:13.440]  graham and by the way lindsay graham is kind of the uh
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:17.600]  the go-between for lack of better term right now between us getting all the
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:21.200]  information about shith and the whole russian collusion
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:26.320]  i mean he's the one kind of blockating it i mean he literally is and you know i
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:28.800]  like josh holly he sounds great everything but
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:32.480]  you know a bigger agrarian supporter and i'm glad that he's rerunning again in
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:35.360]  20 oh he is running again why didn't they just give him his
[2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:38.640]  seat back there was literally a coup by the fbi to get him out of office they
[2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:42.480]  got caught no persons is not our governor i mean
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:45.920]  i i tell everybody that all the time and he acts like he is
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:50.320]  the arrogance of these people is just maddening to me if he had any honor he
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:53.760]  did he gave up his cd to have another election he had done something
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:57.840]  um but i i do have one question for you guys i mean i got some me and some
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:00.960]  buddies here from missouri man are going to close to this we see we are
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:04.480]  pumped up are you guys gonna be there i haven't heard you guys talk much about
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:07.760]  it well i was going to add we we are going to
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:10.960]  be there we didn't want to we didn't want to build it up for obvious reasons but
[2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:13.760]  it's already such a huge event i don't think it matters at this point but uh
[2:14:13.760 --> 2:14:17.520]  we will have uh we will have a presence in tulsa yes and this thing is going to
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:20.880]  be so big and let me tell you something i just call it like it is i've even
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:25.520]  mentioned trump's name yet but uh and i think he is going to have the
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:28.160]  rally but they were thinking about canceling it folks and there was a
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:31.840]  lawsuit now an oklahoma judge basically blocked the lawsuit against
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:34.720]  trump having the rally so it looks like they'll have it but
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:38.800]  him moving the rally from friday to saturday i think was a a mistake but
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:43.680]  but at this point they it does look like they aren't going to cancel it again
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:47.840]  and so saturday in tulsa is going to be i mean
[2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:52.240]  look it's hard to measure how many people are going to come up i i'm guessing
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:57.120]  50 000 trump supporters minimum minimum and you'll probably have a couple
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:01.120]  thousand you know leftist protesters at max uh
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:05.200]  i mean it's just going to be wild and i'll have my prio
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:08.960]  jones t-shirt on and i was listening to serena on the side on
[2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:12.800]  on your show she seemed a little black too but but don't be i mean i
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:16.160]  there's no reason for that we this this is all psychological
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:19.760]  they they are uh uh uh just a puppet that could just
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:23.520]  could be easily smacked down and they're going to see this weekend
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:28.000]  you know we all kind of knew trump was a rally in a round point we know trump
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.880]  don't know politics through and through and he's not perfect
[2:15:30.880 --> 2:15:34.880]  but we got to remember hey he put his family on the line
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:38.400]  you know not too many people and this is and that's it exactly because i don't
[2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:41.920]  know what what goes on in trump's head or what goes on behind the scenes and
[2:15:41.920 --> 2:15:46.400]  again trump is not my savior uh and whatever trump's destiny is
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:50.400]  going to be up to him america's destiny is in our hands
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:54.720]  and so and and and people need to be real too and buck sexton covered it in his
[2:15:54.720 --> 2:15:58.960]  story but folks realistically trump's momentum and ratings are actually
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:02.480]  slipping now he put out a tweet saying he has 96 percent
[2:16:02.480 --> 2:16:06.400]  inside the republican party actually republican numbers actually say he's at
[2:16:06.400 --> 2:16:09.920]  85 percent i don't really carry the way you can get that
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:13.760]  number to 100 percent if you go back on the attack like in 2016
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:16.720]  but the president needs to know we have his back
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:20.720]  he needs to see us saying it he needs to see us saying covet was a hoax
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:24.800]  he needs to say us saying all of this is a lie to get trump and then like like
[2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:29.200]  he kind of like brought the momentum he it was like he was the one that kind of
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:32.080]  forced the momentum now it's like he's kind of going to the back
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:36.080]  now we need to boomerang him back with the momentum
[2:16:36.080 --> 2:16:40.240]  i think he may be waiting for us because look at his family with
[2:16:40.240 --> 2:16:43.760]  what he's put on the line all the millions of dollars he could be making
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:47.680]  all that and honestly a lot of people just set back and and take all this stuff
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:52.240]  i think trump might be waiting for i i think if we go and we stand up
[2:16:52.240 --> 2:16:56.080]  i think trump thinks that we ought to know hey we've got the military we've
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:16:58.880]  got the president we've yeah and you know that's a great point
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:17:03.520]  because i have this story here from slate and this is all optics and it's
[2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:08.080]  how trump lost the military and really they're taking the traders
[2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:11.520]  out of the military that that are coming out against trump they're obviously
[2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:15.760]  just traders uh but in general trump has the military
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:20.000]  maybe not the top generals that got put in there by obama and other such
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:25.280]  but uh the real military i mean the the green berets the marines the the
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:28.880]  infantry like trump has all of them and their support no
[2:17:28.880 --> 2:17:31.440]  matter what so this is all again a psychological thing
[2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:34.320]  oh trump doesn't have the military he's losing
[2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:37.760]  but um we'll see what happens in Tulsa on saturday but
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:42.480]  but i think it's time for trump supporters to get into a wartime mode
[2:17:42.480 --> 2:17:46.000]  and trump maybe will react uh in such a fashion
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:50.960]  lee roy thanks for the call david in california go ahead david
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:54.560]  pleasure to talk with you on thanks for calling i just wanted to
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:59.200]  i just wanted to uh take me back on on what you were talking about talking
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:02.480]  about earlier uh uh conservative wartime
[2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:07.920]  conservatism um and if if the if anything being
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:11.200]  told right now it's that we are going to hit a second wave
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:15.200]  and they're definitely going to take more than just a mile this time we gave
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:19.120]  them a knit they took a mile yeah they'll hammer in the contact tracing and
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:23.040]  they'll start arresting you for violating whatever protocols but
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:27.040]  if that goes down folks i'm telling you just say you're protesting just
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:30.720]  say you're with blm and and then you know oh hey i'm with blm protesting
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:35.120]  oh i didn't realize okay go ahead yeah i think uh
[2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:38.240]  this time around though it's going to be up to us i mean they're they're making
[2:18:38.240 --> 2:18:41.440]  big chess moves against us and this time around it's going to be us
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:45.280]  on us to uh basically let them know and tell them hey you know what
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.960]  you're not going to do this you're not going to continue doing this i mean i'm
[2:18:48.960 --> 2:18:52.960]  in a community here in chulalista where we had the south uh
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:56.080]  the south bay united pentecostal church take their
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:18:59.280]  take it all the way to the supreme court and the supreme court a couple weeks
[2:18:59.280 --> 2:19:03.120]  ago just denied them um because they tried to put limitations on them
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:06.400]  trying to tell me can't even sing in church i think it's going to require
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:10.720]  like local militia to you know show up you know actual christians and
[2:19:10.720 --> 2:19:15.280]  conservatives that have these these ideals and these things in their core
[2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:19.120]  that come out and and you know where is this is a great point because where
[2:19:19.120 --> 2:19:23.920]  where are the hardcore christian conservatives on all this lgbtq stuff
[2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:27.440]  that's going on being force fed to your kids they're talking about pps and
[2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:30.880]  weewees at the supreme court that is a joke
[2:19:30.880 --> 2:19:36.640]  that is a joke and we just sit here and take it
[2:19:36.640 --> 2:19:40.480]  it's like hey we got insurrection going on but yeah neil gorsuch
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:46.240]  right about a pp and a weewee again i think i think it's going to be us on us
[2:19:46.240 --> 2:19:50.480]  to show the you know the the the blue state the
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:54.080]  powers that be in the blue states that we're not going to tolerate this anymore
[2:19:54.080 --> 2:19:58.320]  and that if it's going to come to us and exercising our second amendment
[2:19:58.320 --> 2:20:01.200]  exercising our full constitutional rights and
[2:20:01.200 --> 2:20:05.040]  that's what's going to need to be on the other hand with with with with the
[2:20:05.040 --> 2:20:08.320]  trump rally coming up it's also going to be on us to
[2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:11.680]  express all these things and express this whole
[2:20:11.680 --> 2:20:15.280]  uh conservative this wartime conservatism to the president so that the
[2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:19.280]  president can hear from 50 000 people exactly what it is we want him
[2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:23.040]  yeah it'll be at least 50 000 and by the way thanks for the call David and by
[2:20:23.040 --> 2:20:26.080]  the way folks there are no biden rallies there never
[2:20:26.080 --> 2:20:29.680]  will be a biden rally nobody would show up but if you want to see
[2:20:29.680 --> 2:20:32.960]  what biden support is if you want to see what a biden rally is
[2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:36.720]  go look at a black lives matter protest go look at the thousands turning up in
[2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:39.920]  brooklyn those are your biden rallies no they're not biden rallies and
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:43.440]  anti-trump rallies but there is a support base to vote trump out it's
[2:20:43.440 --> 2:20:47.120]  basically trump versus trump what info wars has been able to do
[2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:50.640]  thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth
[2:20:50.640 --> 2:20:54.880]  has been nothing short of historic and truly epic
[2:20:54.880 --> 2:20:58.640]  this is the battle for the future of humanity
[2:20:58.640 --> 2:21:02.320]  and now open world government is being established
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:08.560]  with an end game to depopulate the planet now the internal operations of the
[2:21:08.560 --> 2:21:14.000]  globalist are being externalized you must decide which side you're on
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.960]  living in denial having mass Stockholm syndrome
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:21.040]  learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery destruction
[2:21:21.040 --> 2:21:25.360]  and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking about
[2:21:25.360 --> 2:21:29.920]  not just a physical death the delusions must end now
[2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:34.480]  info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:36.720]  enemy most people that are aware of the new world
[2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:40.640]  will decide to join it out of fear they are truly fools
[2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:44.400]  we must fight this or lose our souls
[2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:48.000]  i was talking to my patron supplier great suppliers you can now say
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.320]  four weeks on average for storable food it's the highest quality they've got it
[2:21:52.320 --> 2:21:56.240]  use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:21:58.720]  get some air before you get sucked back down
[2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:02.640]  i personally am ordering more storable food i have to now start going into
[2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:05.840]  defense posture 80 offence but i've always been
[2:22:05.840 --> 2:22:09.120]  100 offence trying to fully you know stop the
[2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:12.240]  globalists and we've given them a good run and i think down the road they'll be
[2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:15.280]  defeated but we are going to still go down the
[2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:19.600]  hard road now there were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down but
[2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:22.720]  we've mitigated some of this but it's it's still gonna be bad my view
[2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:25.360]  you need to get high quality sort of food it's something you need

[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:30.400]  floor excuse me the congressional floor
[2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:33.760]  saying republicans don't even care about black people

[2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:02.720]  you're on the alex jones show chase the patriot on the youtube go ahead
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:06.320]  hey thanks for taking my call and i want to start off it sounds like old
[2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:09.280]  swalwell there was uh letting off a little hot
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:14.160]  gas huh he's known for that one well you know their buddy down there ed buck who
[2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:17.360]  probably provides them with uh you know well god knows what
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:20.960]  in that drug rape dungeon he's in jail so uh they're probably running a little
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:24.640]  short on that but yeah you know it's okay adam schiff and swalwell
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:28.000]  real stand-up gentlemen the kind of guys you want uh you know babysitting your
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:31.280]  kids and making you a pastrami sandwich and stuff
[2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:34.320]  yeah i don't know about old shipy there i think he's a little nervous with some
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:37.440]  of the papers coming out right now but you bring up a good point too old
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:40.560]  lindsey graham there he's sitting there as the head of the
[2:25:40.560 --> 2:25:44.720]  judiciary committee for the senate and he's just kind of twiddling his thumbs
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:47.280]  and not getting anything done at all it seems like
[2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:50.640]  but thankfully you know kind of what i was calling in about we have senator
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:53.920]  holly there he's only been in there a couple years now really
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:58.400]  but he is setting the example for maybe that next generation or that next
[2:25:58.400 --> 2:26:02.480]  mentality for the conservative politician and you know
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:05.440]  whether it's trying to take on the big tech companies
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:09.200]  or you know what he's doing today there's a lot of things that are
[2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:11.840]  good to see coming out of senator holly because
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:15.520]  our court system all the way back to marbury versus madison
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:20.160]  has been corrupted and whether you like the ruling today or you dislike the
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:23.520]  ruling today it's completely politicized the
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:27.440]  bench has gone completely to the left or to the right as they say
[2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:30.640]  but really it needs to be the constitution it needs to be the bill of
[2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:33.760]  right that's what they need to worry about well but think about this think
[2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:36.240]  about what that what is actually happening with these supreme court
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:39.120]  decisions and this is how you know everything is so
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:42.080]  lost because if you ask oh do you want to like the
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:44.880]  like the left doesn't want the police okay so you don't want the government
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:47.040]  involved in your life that's really what you're saying
[2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:50.400]  i would think that most conservatives agree with that notion
[2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:54.240]  i don't want the government involved in my life either the problem is the left
[2:26:54.240 --> 2:26:58.160]  has a double standard they want the government involved in your life
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:02.080]  when it's politically advantageous to them they want the government involved
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:05.680]  in your life when they can use it as a
[2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:10.080]  social justice militarized attack on you in the country
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:13.360]  so this whole gay lesbian rights thing is the latest
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:17.040]  so they've now made it that and by the way you know what's going to happen
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:20.480]  folks because you fire a black person or you fire a gay person they sue you
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:24.000]  immediately nobody's going to hire them anymore because you just get sued if they
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.960]  get let go so so that's not going to go well but
[2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:30.000]  for everybody out there oh we don't want the government in our lives we want
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.160]  small government or i don't want the police in our lives
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:35.280]  so so the government is now in everything you do
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:38.960]  because of the supreme court ruling like this and so i think it's time for the
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:42.480]  supreme court to just rewrite all these rulings and say you know what
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:45.440]  the government doesn't belong in your life so if you want to discriminate
[2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:49.200]  against somebody then then you know what that you're right
[2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:52.640]  and the people will decide if you're an open racist
[2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:56.960]  and you don't let a gay person eat at your restaurant or a black person
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:00.240]  you know go to your business guess what word is going to get out
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:03.760]  there's all kinds of law groups there's all kinds of media and those businesses
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:06.880]  will be shut down we don't need the damn government ruling on this
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.200]  because now they've just militarized they've militarized all these different
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:14.640]  left-wing activist groups i'm sorry chase go ahead
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:18.160]  yeah and i was going to say it doesn't matter the case like you're saying
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:22.480]  today it could be this case or tomorrow it could be a second amendment case
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:28.240]  either side might get upset nine unelected people that are nominated and
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:32.800]  appointed as political appointment have control over three hundred and
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:36.240]  twenty five million people and how they live their life so what you're saying
[2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:39.440]  oh and real quick i gotta just ask if something
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:43.440]  that my callers keep calling in and asking me about is the national assembly
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:47.280]  and the organic act of 1871 it's the whole idea
[2:28:47.280 --> 2:28:51.120]  of when the united states of america became all capital letters
[2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:54.720]  united states of america and how the whole corporate america
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:58.320]  changed the way that our law system and our government interacts with us have
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:02.000]  you heard anything about that you know i'd have to do more research but there's
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:05.440]  no doubt the way everything is set up it protects corporations more than our
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:09.680]  individual rights yeah that's definitely a true
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:13.680]  hey and i appreciate the time given me and everybody out there just spread the
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:17.040]  word get your voice out there research topics and
[2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:20.560]  communicate with your neighbors and people at work and people at school
[2:29:20.560 --> 2:29:24.240]  that's the one way we can override oh yeah no doubt you gotta be void you gotta
[2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:26.960]  be a voice these days folks you have to be and by the way just an
[2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:29.680]  addendum to the last thing i said thanks chase
[2:29:29.680 --> 2:29:32.800]  it so it's a weird flux though now because it used to be
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:35.920]  that we had a government that was designed and intended to protect the
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:39.600]  rights of individuals that's way gone then it got bought and controlled by the
[2:29:39.600 --> 2:29:42.000]  corporations and it was all about protecting their rights that's why you
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:45.760]  have a secret vaccine court and you know monsanto gets to continue operating
[2:29:45.760 --> 2:29:49.760]  with roundup and such but now the new thing is
[2:29:49.760 --> 2:29:54.080]  it only protects left-wing activists which the democrat party just claims
[2:29:54.080 --> 2:29:57.920]  they're fighting for in a fraudulent manner and so now the whole system is
[2:29:57.920 --> 2:30:01.680]  being designed to only protect you if you're a left-wing activist and they
[2:30:01.680 --> 2:30:05.040]  hide under all kinds of guises oh i'm a transsexual
[2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:08.400]  oh i'm gay oh i'm a minority none of that matters
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:12.000]  until the left wing makes it matter with their political edicts
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:15.360]  and their supreme court decisions which is what's going on
[2:30:15.360 --> 2:30:20.240]  eric in florida go ahead eric you're on the alex joneshow
[2:30:20.240 --> 2:30:25.600]  hey shorty the destroyer hold on let me take out speaker

[2:30:29.760 --> 2:30:36.720]  thanks for calling yeah and good work um i called a long time ago
[2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:42.800]  and if you might remember was uh dealing with
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:50.720]  trans trans vestites and using
[2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:57.280]  i mentioned a girlfriend and she worked for capital one
[2:30:57.280 --> 2:31:03.680]  and this is back in 96 97 and i told her it was creating a hostile work
[2:31:03.680 --> 2:31:08.080]  environment that they were cleaning their own baths before they'd used it
[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:13.040]  after he would but i told her to go to human resources and all that no
[2:31:13.040 --> 2:31:16.960]  matter how hard it pushed her it wasn't working
[2:31:16.960 --> 2:31:21.680]  finally she decided to do it and they told her
[2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:26.160]  that they can do that now look at how far it's gone
[2:31:26.160 --> 2:31:30.400]  well that's my point now everything is being designed to protect
[2:31:30.400 --> 2:31:34.720]  left-wing agitators that's it like i said they hide under the guys of oh i'm
[2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:37.600]  gay or minority or you know i cut my penis off or whatever
[2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:40.960]  and so the whole system is now designed to protect them
[2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:45.760]  at all costs so it's the leftist is politicized and corrupted everything in
[2:31:45.760 --> 2:31:49.120]  this country and people get it now but it's time to start
[2:31:49.120 --> 2:31:52.640]  not just realizing it but pushing back against it thanks for the call eric

[2:34:29.920 --> 2:34:32.560]  his name on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:35.680]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:38.960]  is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and
[2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:41.440]  you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot to me thank

[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:51.680]  with true atomic iodine listeners have been asking us for months
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:55.600]  to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:58.080]  iodine after extensive development it's finally
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:35:02.080]  here our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:05.760]  power of ancient iodine crystals from 7 000 feet below the earth's surface
[2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:09.600]  into an ultimate spray formula i have been using the new x2 spray every day
[2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:13.120]  and i feel good knowing that i have the power of true nascent iodine working
[2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:15.520]  for my body i can personally feel the difference
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:18.960]  we know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:23.120]  as well as healthy metabolism healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive
[2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:26.400]  function iodine may also support your body and healthy response to

[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:40.960]  infowarsstore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment
[2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:47.920]  that's infowarsstore.com the people of the world have awakened to globalism
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:50.960]  and so populist movements are throwing the globalist
[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:55.760]  out of their countries that's why the new world order is instituting race war
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:36:00.560]  and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your
[2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:04.800]  local police and government and destroying essential services
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:08.880]  this is an attempt to have society collapse
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:12.240]  and the globalists as they've done in the third world will come in and pick up
[2:36:12.240 --> 2:36:15.520]  the pieces we must stand against the UN the IMF the
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:19.760]  world bank and the EU openly saying we fund the police
[2:36:19.760 --> 2:36:23.280]  the police have a lot of problems we all have a lot of problems but this is our
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:26.480]  government and our local tabulary and believe me once the globalists have
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:30.320]  overthrown this country they are going to put in a real police
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:33.280]  state where you have no due process or freedom the globalists believe common
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:37.120]  China is the model of the world and they are orchestrating this
[2:36:37.120 --> 2:36:40.160]  entire thing the people helping them are collaborators
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:44.560]  and are idiots and must be opposed infowars.com
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:49.840]  i've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and
[2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:54.560]  when you shoot an L could say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:37:01.120]  they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:04.240]  pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all the
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:07.440]  sudden they slow down they realize what's happened
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:11.360]  they fall over and they die then you go bag them and
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:16.320]  haul them back in well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:20.720]  and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot
[2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:24.640]  right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:28.560]  horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to
[2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:31.200]  mean probably over a hundred million dead according to the UN and i believe
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:35.360]  their numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to
[2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:38.560]  depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that thought it was their
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:41.840]  revolution to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:45.440]  something better than what Hitler did
[2:37:46.800 --> 2:37:51.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:51.440 --> 2:38:01.040]  all right we're going to go to david night real quick folks
[2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:06.000]  but uh joe biden is being propped up by fox news right now
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:11.040]  he's giving a speech in darby pennsylvania i guarantee you it's an empty room
[2:38:11.040 --> 2:38:14.720]  i guarantee you it's an empty room aside from media and he's bashing trump for
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:18.240]  the coveted response bashing white america saying oh black people are
[2:38:18.240 --> 2:38:20.960]  victims and oppressed even though he's the one that was responsible for it
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:25.120]  Joe biden is the modern day leader of the kkk which is the democrat party
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:29.200]  um so uh it's just incredible to see fox news building this guy up as a real
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:32.480]  candidate uh ladies and gentlemen info war store
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:35.040]  dot com is how everything we do here is possible

[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:11.040]  going to be key they're building up for a second fake wave of coronavirus so
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:13.120]  there's going to be another russian emergency food
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:16.560]  uh so i would get shopping and order that before it comes probably about two
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:19.520]  weeks away from that is my guess now here's a special report from david night
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:22.320]  i was saying before we went to break didn't have enough time to play it then
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:25.040]  about five years ago if you remember we had the horrific shooting
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:30.480]  dylan roof and it was unbelievably evil and hateful
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:35.360]  and yet nicky hailey and many people at the time were using that
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:39.440]  to call for the eradication of history and i said at the time it isn't going to
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:42.400]  stop with the confederate symbols it isn't going to stop
[2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:46.320]  by enforcing their idea of what confederate symbols are because you know
[2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:50.400]  if you say well this is about the ku klux klan well the ku klux klan burns
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:53.200]  crosses so we're going to have to get rid of crosses too oh well yeah they're
[2:39:53.200 --> 2:39:57.040]  they're not essential either it never ends
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:01.040]  and uh so i want to play for you what walter williams
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:04.400]  said five years ago as this is happening walter williams
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:07.440]  a libertarian economist who teaches at george
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:11.440]  mason university in washington this is walter williams on
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:15.360]  banning the confederate flag a black economist five years ago video clip
[2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:18.800]  number two steve and arlington heights illinois
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:22.480]  texts into you can you speak to the anti confederate
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:26.720]  hysteria currently sweeping the nation um
[2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:30.640]  yes i i think that being i think people don't really
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:36.960]  understand much of the history of our of our country
[2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:41.360]  and and and just very briefly and and this is on my website and my
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:49.600]  articles um and i i talk about this and that is in 1783 uh 1783
[2:40:49.600 --> 2:40:54.640]  there was a treaty of paris and the treaty of paris ended the war between
[2:40:54.640 --> 2:40:59.280]  the colonies in great britain and if you read the treaty of paris it says that
[2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:02.480]  there are 13 sovereign nation that is each state
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:06.560]  was a a nation and these states came together
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:13.200]  as as principles uh in um in 1787 and they created the federal
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:18.000]  government as their agent and and and principles can always fire
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:22.800]  their agents and so um and if you read and if you read the uh
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:26.960]  the ratification documents of rhodial and new york and virginia
[2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:31.440]  they specifically say in the documents that if the federal government becomes
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:35.120]  abusive of the powers that we have delegated to the federal government
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:39.040]  we have the right to rescind those uh those uh those powers
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:43.360]  that is we have the right to uh uh secede and so
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:49.040]  so most americans do not uh understand the uh you know they they
[2:41:49.040 --> 2:41:55.040]  think that the war was solely uh to to end slavery
[2:41:55.040 --> 2:41:59.040]  but the war was uh for much more than that and so
[2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:02.400]  but however the the winners of any war
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:07.840]  write the uh write its history and so the the confederacy
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:11.760]  as just uh you know they've gotten a really a bad name
[2:42:11.760 --> 2:42:17.600]  and i think that um i i think that this and i confederacy
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:24.080]  movement uh is uh just maybe one more one more step towards
[2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:27.600]  uh you know towards abolishing many of our
[2:42:27.600 --> 2:42:33.600]  symbols now one can argue one can argue whether
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:37.520]  the confederacy was right in in uh in seceding
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:40.560]  and you don't have to be for slavery you can be against slavery
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:44.640]  but that's an independent argument did they have the right to secede
[2:42:44.640 --> 2:42:48.640]  and all the evidence suggests yes they did have the right to secede
[2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:54.560]  because the states were principles and they came together and created the
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:42:58.000]  federal government that is most americans today think that they
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:01.680]  virtually think that the states are a creation of the federal government
[2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:05.520]  and matter of fact that's the way congress acts that the states are a creation
[2:43:05.520 --> 2:43:08.880]  of the federal government but it's actually the opposite
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:12.560]  that's right and what the founders of this country
[2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:18.160]  who listened to Walter Williams who's exactly right 1783 the treaty of paris
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:22.160]  that ended the war with great britain and in that you could see that the
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:26.320]  colonies were treated as sovereign states you know we talk about
[2:43:26.320 --> 2:43:30.640]  various heads of state that means that people who were ahead of germany or
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:37.360]  france or the uk or the united states and prior to the civil war
[2:43:37.360 --> 2:43:42.400]  it was always the united states are after the civil war became united states
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:46.160]  is it became a consolidated entity which was
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:49.920]  anathema to the people who had fought for their freedom they did not want to
[2:43:49.920 --> 2:43:55.920]  have a top-down pyramid structure of power that's why
[2:43:55.920 --> 2:44:00.080]  they divided the federal government into three competing power centers which
[2:44:00.080 --> 2:44:03.520]  now don't compete against each other anymore
[2:44:03.520 --> 2:44:09.200]  and it's why they reserved power to the states and to the people
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:12.880]  we're not talking about states rights states don't have rights individuals
[2:44:12.880 --> 2:44:16.480]  have rights states had power
[2:44:16.480 --> 2:44:20.400]  and they wanted the states to have power to keep that consolidation from
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:25.360]  happening you know as Walter Williams was talking about that 1783 treaty
[2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:28.560]  they operated before they had the constitution under articles of
[2:44:28.560 --> 2:44:32.800]  confederation you see after the revolution
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:39.200]  america was a confederacy a confederacy and not a union because a union
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:44.000]  implies a tighter control they did not want to have that
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:48.400]  initially and even after they went to
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:52.480]  a union there was no more of a union than the united nations
[2:44:52.480 --> 2:44:56.240]  is and let me ask you you know we are one of the
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:44:59.840]  many different states that created the united nations if the united nations
[2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:03.520]  you know president trump said yeah we're going to leave the who when i'm
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:07.920]  going to pay them any money anymore i applaud that that's excellent
[2:45:07.920 --> 2:45:12.960]  i hope that that really does happen but if president trump
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:15.760]  were to do something else that i would like to see happen
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:19.280]  and if you were to say uh we're going to leave the united nations
[2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:25.520]  as well and we'd like for the united nations to relocate their headquarters
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:30.080]  somewhere else if president trump were to do that
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:35.280]  and if you were to have the other countries in the united nations say how
[2:45:35.280 --> 2:45:38.800]  dare you you cannot leave the united nations you were subordinate to the
[2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:42.880]  united nations and what if they were to raise a massive army
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:48.560]  for the purpose of invading america and forcing us to remain in the united
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:52.160]  nation would we be justified in defending ourselves
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:58.080]  because that's how it happened with the war of northern aggression that's
[2:45:58.080 --> 2:46:02.560]  exactly how it happened and my wife is from new york and uh
[2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:07.680]  as i was explaining the civil war to her somebody who grew up in the south
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:12.240]  uh i was more familiar with the history than she was she was familiar with the
[2:46:12.240 --> 2:46:15.280]  history that had been written by the grand army of the republic the winners
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:18.960]  who write history is walter williams point out you know we have marxists who
[2:46:18.960 --> 2:46:22.240]  erase history that's what is happening right now
[2:46:22.240 --> 2:46:25.920]  the winners write history the marxists erase history
[2:46:25.920 --> 2:46:30.400]  because they have to erase the culture and the society so they can take it over
[2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:33.760]  from the ground up but as i was explaining that to her i said
[2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:39.440]  i i used that same exact analogy 45 years ago
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:43.280]  and i said uh i can imagine i said don't think about the united nations what if
[2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:46.400]  we were to have a situation because already at that point in time you had
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:50.400]  the radical environmentalist whining about automobile emissions and how it's
[2:46:50.400 --> 2:46:52.800]  going to damage it we got to do this for the
[2:46:52.800 --> 2:46:56.640]  global economy and so forth i said what if these people
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:01.280]  decided that they were going to ban internal combustion engines
[2:47:01.280 --> 2:47:04.240]  and what if we in america said no i don't think so
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:06.880]  we're going to continue along doing what we've been doing we're going to have
[2:47:06.880 --> 2:47:09.520]  our cars we're going to have our factories to produce electricity
[2:47:09.520 --> 2:47:12.720]  so we can manufacture because at that time we were using
[2:47:12.720 --> 2:47:16.480]  the most energy of anybody and we were creating the most pollution because we
[2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:20.240]  were doing most of the manufacturing now that is gone to china and they make no
[2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:23.760]  efforts in china to control their emissions but i said let's say that
[2:47:23.760 --> 2:47:26.240]  america said no we're not going to go along with that
[2:47:26.240 --> 2:47:31.120]  and let's say the globalists the the un decided that uh they were going to
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:34.960]  force us to do that and they were going to attack us
[2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:37.680]  you know they're going to force us one way the other way aside we won't get out
[2:47:37.680 --> 2:47:41.200]  and they attack us i said that's exactly what happened from an economic
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:44.960]  standpoint now there was a moral standpoint that you cannot ignore
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:49.520]  but these people who focus strictly on the moral issues
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:54.480]  are completely missing the political issues that are also very very important
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:57.040]  because if you don't understand those issues
[2:47:57.040 --> 2:48:00.560]  you can eliminate private slavery but you can make
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:05.920]  slavery universal for everybody of every race color creed so forth and
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:09.440]  that's exactly what we have done all the projections
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:13.360]  that were made by the founders of this country by the people who succeeded
[2:48:13.360 --> 2:48:16.560]  said we don't want to have a consolidated country all the predictions that
[2:48:16.560 --> 2:48:19.760]  they made they said if you allow this to happen this is what's going to happen
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:23.520]  and they would not have been surprised in the least
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:26.640]  to see what the federal government has turned into
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:33.040]  and the wake of that we'll be right back stay with us
[2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:38.720]  this is the end my friends my only friends the end
[2:48:38.720 --> 2:48:44.480]  of our elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the end
[2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:49.280]  the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen
[2:48:49.280 --> 2:48:54.960]  because there was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:58.880]  like children never growing up never caring about other people
[2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:03.440]  this delivered us into the hands of tyranny just like the history book
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:07.280]  show us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt and
[2:49:07.280 --> 2:49:11.520]  evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:16.800]  because their people sold out to special interests that were infiltrated by spies
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:20.640]  and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again today
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:26.480]  compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:30.720]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:34.560]  thanks to your support and your prayers
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:38.160]  i was talking to my patreon supplier great suppliers you can now say
[2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:42.480]  four weeks on average for storable food it's the highest quality they've got it
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:46.560]  use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service get
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:48.880]  some air before you get sucked back down
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:52.800]  i personally am ordering more storeable food i have to now start going into
[2:49:52.800 --> 2:49:56.800]  defense posture 80% offense but i've always been 100%
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:00.400]  offense trying to fully you know stop the globalists and we've given them a
[2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:04.240]  good run and i think down the road they'll be defeated but
[2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:08.160]  we're gonna still go down the hard road now there were a lot worse roads we
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:11.520]  probably go down but uh we've mitigated some of this but it's
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:14.480]  it's still gonna be bad my view you need to get high quality storeable food
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:17.840]  it's something you need we have high quality ready to get out to you
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:20.560]  and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins so please take care of your

[2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:35.440]  you ain't seen nothing yet
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:46.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:46.960 --> 2:50:57.280]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're
[2:50:57.280 --> 2:51:02.160]  listening to the alex jones show and now your host
[2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:07.680]  john rapaport
[2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:15.360]  john rapaport here once again talking about
[2:51:15.360 --> 2:51:24.640]  the operation the operation to destroy america to destroy other countries
[2:51:24.640 --> 2:51:28.080]  and the concept of liberty
[2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:33.360]  these are the times to try men's souls
[2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:41.200]  sunshine patriots the words of thomas pain perhaps you remember them from
[2:51:41.200 --> 2:51:46.960]  the crisis number one one of his pamphlets it was during the
[2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:50.080]  revolutionary war
[2:51:50.960 --> 2:51:56.320]  washington's army was on the verge of complete collapse and defeat
[2:51:56.320 --> 2:52:04.640]  in the winter 11 000 troops had simply walked out and gone home
[2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:08.960]  contracts were ready to expire on the rest of the army
[2:52:08.960 --> 2:52:13.680]  it was assumed that they would walk home as well
[2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:22.720]  and so thomas pain put out a second pamphlet crisis number one
[2:52:22.720 --> 2:52:27.200]  after common sense common sense of course
[2:52:27.200 --> 2:52:30.720]  had done a great deal to spur on the american
[2:52:30.720 --> 2:52:35.280]  revolution of independence from england
[2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:43.200]  and so several events happened that were fortunate for washington's army
[2:52:43.200 --> 2:52:49.520]  but one of the main ones was that he got a hold of thomas pain's pamphlet
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:53.360]  and he said the morale of the troops needs to be
[2:52:53.360 --> 2:53:00.560]  boosted and so i want these words of thomas pain to be read to the troops
[2:53:00.560 --> 2:53:07.760]  and so they were from the pamphlet these are the times that try men's souls
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:12.640]  freedom
[2:53:13.760 --> 2:53:19.040]  and the morale of the troops was boosted and they went on
[2:53:19.040 --> 2:53:24.560]  to obtain victories against the hessians against how
[2:53:24.560 --> 2:53:30.080]  the tide turned in the revolutionary war on the whole concept of oppression
[2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:33.200]  liberty courage
[2:53:33.520 --> 2:53:39.040]  willingness to go all the way
[2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:43.360]  to fight and to die if necessary
[2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:51.520]  in other words there was a time in our history when what we're seeing now
[2:53:51.520 --> 2:53:58.800]  the completely preposterous imprisonment of the population
[2:53:58.800 --> 2:54:05.680]  the so-called lockdowns the contact tracing the surveillance the testing
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:10.800]  the vaccine the whole idea of having to present
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:19.200]  some form of guarantee of immunity in order to gain access to travel and
[2:54:19.200 --> 2:54:25.840]  which is the plan and to work and go to the office and all of this
[2:54:25.840 --> 2:54:34.240]  all of that there was a time when all of that would have been defeated overnight
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:38.800]  the population of america would never have stood for it
[2:54:38.800 --> 2:54:42.160]  they would have come out onto the roads the streets
[2:54:42.160 --> 2:54:49.920]  the farms the fields the city halls wherever they needed to
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:56.240]  en masse by the millions and they would have said
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:02.160]  you're telling us we can't work we can't earn a living
[2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:09.840]  that we might be sick that because we might get ill and pass some sickness on
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:14.480]  that you're going to destroy the entire country and the entire economy
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:16.880]  really
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:22.720]  it's not going to happen we're not going to do it
[2:55:22.720 --> 2:55:27.520]  and it would have been over at that point Fauci would have been a
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:32.160]  simple little disgusting clown that would have been swept away in the tide
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:36.240]  the coronavirus task force gone forever
[2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:39.920]  we'll have more to say about this and about america after the break
[2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:44.400]  john raffport on info wars it's finally here

[2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:02.080]  people don't have any sense of history left
[2:57:02.080 --> 2:57:06.320]  because it's been wiped away by the schools
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:10.800]  but there was a time when this entire insanity
[2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:14.560]  that we're facing now would have been over in one night
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:18.560]  people would have come out of their houses with guns
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:23.680]  understanding their right to defend themselves their lives
[2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:29.600]  their jobs their businesses their their right to earn a living their
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:35.680]  survival and they would have said
[2:57:35.680 --> 2:57:40.160]  you've gone insane you're not going to produce this kind of an effect on the
[2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:44.240]  country on us on anybody
[2:57:44.960 --> 2:57:49.120]  so not only is this not going to happen but we're going to throw you out of

[2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:03.600]  all about what we've established here
[2:58:03.600 --> 2:58:09.840]  on this continent in terms of limited government
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:15.760]  which was the point of the exercise and the sacrifice and the blood and the
[2:58:15.760 --> 2:58:21.600]  dying not to the creation of government but with
[2:58:21.600 --> 2:58:26.720]  grudging willingness to frame a constitution
[2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:32.480]  that would create yes a country of federal government
[2:58:32.480 --> 2:58:39.120]  severely hamstrung with severely limited powers
[2:58:39.120 --> 2:58:43.440]  to interfere in the lives of the people
[2:58:43.520 --> 2:58:49.840]  that was the point and independence from england
[2:58:49.840 --> 2:58:52.960]  and this was all going to be thrown away overnight
[2:58:52.960 --> 2:58:57.120]  when people could remember members of their family their relatives their
[2:58:57.120 --> 2:59:00.480]  friends people they knew well in their communities
[2:59:00.480 --> 2:59:07.840]  who had shed blood and died in the war of revolution of 1776
[2:59:08.480 --> 2:59:11.200]  and they were going to throw all that away for
[2:59:11.200 --> 2:59:21.360]  Anthony Fauci you're kidding me for Deborah Birx for Robert Redfield
[2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:26.800]  for some computer modeler from england named Neil Ferguson
[2:59:26.800 --> 2:59:30.720]  with an abject record of failure
[2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:34.320]  who predicted two million people would die in America
[2:59:34.320 --> 2:59:37.760]  because of COVID-19
[2:59:39.840 --> 2:59:43.600]  the population of a free and brave country we're going to throw
[2:59:43.600 --> 2:59:46.960]  away their entire revolution and what it stood for
[2:59:46.960 --> 2:59:50.720]  and what it meant and what it passed down to future generations
[2:59:50.720 --> 2:59:55.200]  and all the blood and the sacrifice simply for this
[2:59:55.200 --> 3:00:02.000]  no never would have happened but now
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:04.800]  now look
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:12.320]  look at the great city of new york it's desolate
[3:00:12.320 --> 3:00:16.960]  a friend was telling me the other day he was walking on the streets
[3:00:16.960 --> 3:00:22.560]  of Manhattan around the famous flat iron building
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:27.760]  around 23rd street i know the area well
[3:00:28.400 --> 3:00:35.840]  board it up store after shop after store after store streets
[3:00:35.840 --> 3:00:42.240]  empty occasionally people appearing walking
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:48.240]  along wearing a mask
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:52.800]  this is what happened to the great city of new york
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:57.200]  and the citizenry of new york especially the business owners
[3:00:57.200 --> 3:01:01.600]  the people who have a stake in earning their own way
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:06.560]  have folded up like a house of cards that fell
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:12.080]  and submitted completely we surrender to the lockdowns we surrender
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:19.600]  to the fascist dictator Cuomo and the little puppet dictator de Blasio
[3:01:21.040 --> 3:01:29.520]  no courage left no guts no honor nothing zero
[3:01:29.520 --> 3:01:35.600]  so it falls to the people who are willing
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:40.480]  to do what needs to be done to overthrow
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:45.840]  this fascist tyranny that has taken over by bloodless coup
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:50.880]  the government of states and the government of the united states
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:54.240]  a long time ago i wrote a piece called
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:57.760]  anthony Fauci the interim president of the united states
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:04.160]  and it was the case he was the acting president and still in many ways
[3:02:04.160 --> 3:02:11.760]  is the acting president this little chorp who has nothing at all
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:19.120]  except having had the capacity to worm his way up politically into a
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:23.600]  position of power this has nothing to do with
[3:02:23.600 --> 3:02:29.520]  competence science any of that i know the left adores
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:35.440]  Fauci they think he's the counterbalance to the deranged president
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:40.800]  the only man of common sense among us who is willing to state the facts and
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:47.840]  all of that which is sheer preposterous bs
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:54.080]  insanity nothing could be further from the truth
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:03:00.320]  so i ask you this question and i hope you consider it seriously
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:05.520]  if you walked into a doctor's office and you're feeling all right you're going
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:10.640]  for whatever reason don't know why but there you are physical
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:14.720]  checkup whatever and the doctor says i'm afraid
[3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:22.080]  that you are in terrible condition your prospects are not very good in fact
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:27.040]  you need to be put on life support immediately
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:32.000]  would it not occur to you to find a second opinion
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:40.400]  that's a very least that's a very least a second opinion wouldn't it
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:45.280]  somebody gives a patient that kind of diagnosis of course
[3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:48.480]  well what about the diagnosis for the country
[3:03:48.480 --> 3:03:53.120]  Anthony Fauci gets up and gives his opinion
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:58.160]  the country's on life support
[3:03:58.880 --> 3:04:02.720]  and is there no second opinion well as a matter of fact there are many second
[3:04:02.720 --> 3:04:06.000]  opinions and now i'm not even talking about the
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:10.160]  deep dive that i and other people have taken into the
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:15.040]  fabricated hoax that is the pandemic from the outset which we'll talk about a
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:18.640]  little bit later but what i'm talking about here is
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:24.080]  conventional medical scientific authorities in the united
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:27.760]  states in germany in england and other places
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:33.520]  who have in sweden who have stepped out and said
[3:04:34.160 --> 3:04:40.880]  the lockdowns are completely insane even within the conventional view of what
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:46.080]  COVID-19 is it's insane it's counterproductive
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:50.480]  it's destroying lives in the process and economies of course
[3:04:50.480 --> 3:04:54.320]  and putting people in severe danger they're committing
[3:04:54.320 --> 3:04:59.920]  suicide at a higher rate drug addiction violence
[3:04:59.920 --> 3:05:08.880]  poverty bankruptcy hopelessness around the planet for what for nothing
[3:05:08.880 --> 3:05:13.040]  and i would point you to one article
[3:05:13.040 --> 3:05:16.720]  by jb handley at children's health defense
[3:05:16.720 --> 3:05:20.960]  called lockdown lunacy a thinking person's guide
[3:05:20.960 --> 3:05:24.320]  and the reason that i do that and there it is on the screen
[3:05:24.320 --> 3:05:31.360]  is because what handley does is all right taking the somewhat
[3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:35.120]  conventional approach all right there is a virus there are tests there are
[3:05:35.120 --> 3:05:39.680]  numbers of cases etc etc let's look at what
[3:05:39.680 --> 3:05:44.560]  other medical authorities besides fauci
[3:05:44.560 --> 3:05:48.480]  and his minions have to say about all of this and when we do
[3:05:48.480 --> 3:05:52.000]  and handley cites many such studies and authorities
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:57.840]  we see the entire operation is insane
[3:05:57.840 --> 3:06:07.120]  psychotic psychopathic deranged criminal murderous
[3:06:08.720 --> 3:06:12.000]  a second opinion
[3:06:13.840 --> 3:06:18.080]  wouldn't you think the prime minister of a country or the president of a
[3:06:18.080 --> 3:06:21.920]  country would pause for that and say well i understand
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:26.240]  what you're saying dr fauci or dr fergusson but we're going to consult
[3:06:26.240 --> 3:06:29.520]  the second opinion here before we knock
[3:06:29.520 --> 3:06:35.440]  down and lock down the whole friggin country and destroy everybody's lives
[3:06:35.440 --> 3:06:38.880]  and there was a time when this would not have stood

[3:09:56.720 --> 3:10:01.520]  we're never going back never doing another lockdown no matter what
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:08.240]  opening up beyond what's permitted
[3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:16.560]  by these lunatics no app no contact tracing app
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:22.560]  no tracing no cooperation with tracing no cooperation with testing no

[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:56.000]  you know redo everything and put a rainbow in
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:11:01.600]  Fauci's brain and then it'll be all over i don't think so
[3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:04.400]  i don't think so
[3:11:05.680 --> 3:11:13.120]  and now we have the second wave man the line i have a language barrier here
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:17.200]  when i get rolling have to understand that there's a great deal of restraint
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:21.280]  in the language that i'm using because otherwise i would go off
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:26.480]  completely and say things that apparently are not
[3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:32.640]  permitted in the public airwaves but anyway
[3:11:33.440 --> 3:11:38.240]  here we are the second wave now
[3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:42.880]  Fauci is telling major league baseball does he want to be the commissioner the
[3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:46.800]  next commissioner uh you know if you have a season
[3:11:46.800 --> 3:11:50.240]  it should end in october because next winter
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:55.920]  we could have more of this thanks Fauci
[3:11:57.120 --> 3:12:02.880]  China are you kidding me China is now locking down what part of Beijing the
[3:12:02.880 --> 3:12:08.480]  second wave of cases what happened the first time in China
[3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:14.000]  let's get into a little history the two major events that started this entire
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:19.360]  planned operation okay not spontaneous
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:26.240]  not at all the first was China locking down 50 million
[3:12:26.240 --> 3:12:31.200]  citizens overnight three cities that expanded to a hundred million very
[3:12:31.200 --> 3:12:36.320]  quickly and that gave the signal which was
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:41.680]  not spontaneous but there it was to the cdc the world's health
[3:12:41.680 --> 3:12:44.880]  organization and the governments around the world
[3:12:44.880 --> 3:12:52.240]  oh okay we can lock down too because China just broke the ice
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:56.160]  this is what we've been trying to do with every dud frigging epidemic since the
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:00.240]  beginning since SARS since west nile since
[3:13:00.240 --> 3:13:05.760]  Ebola since Zika since swine flu etc etc right
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:08.880]  and we didn't bring it off but now China has done it
[3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:12.800]  and the UN and world health organization oh we love China
[3:13:12.800 --> 3:13:15.840]  aren't they wonderful they showed us the way
[3:13:15.840 --> 3:13:20.000]  this is what we want Rockefeller loves China he
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:26.960]  praised China to the skies in 1973 they only killed what was it 45 60
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:31.200]  billion people in order to bring about Mao's revolution isn't that
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:37.200]  wonderful blah blah blah blah blah and now
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:40.880]  other countries can institute these lockdowns and then what happened
[3:13:40.880 --> 3:13:47.920]  Italy the first beachhead on the western shore so to speak
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:52.400]  lockdown half the country locked down the whole country
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:55.680]  heads of the provinces in Italy at the time
[3:13:55.680 --> 3:13:59.840]  the first lockdown occurred didn't even know was going to happen
[3:13:59.840 --> 3:14:04.720]  central government announced it overnight bang bang bang
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:09.920]  and then like dominoes that began to fall
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:17.680]  but then something else was needed okay a prediction a threat an ominous cloud
[3:14:17.680 --> 3:14:24.640]  had to appear over the stupid stupid clueless
[3:14:24.640 --> 3:14:30.080]  lunatic heads of government of nations around the world
[3:14:30.080 --> 3:14:34.080]  a prediction of how many deaths could occur
[3:14:34.080 --> 3:14:40.480]  from COVID-19 and for that they had a criminal idiot named Neil Ferguson
[3:14:40.480 --> 3:14:44.400]  who worked at the imperial college in London
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:51.120]  his institute Ferguson's is supported by tens of million dollars every year
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:55.040]  from guess who Bill Gates of course of course of course
[3:14:55.040 --> 3:15:01.760]  and so Ferguson came up with the model and this was months ago and he said
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:08.560]  could be 500,000 deaths in in England and 2 million in the US
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:13.520]  the man had an abysmal record of failure
[3:15:13.520 --> 3:15:18.560]  as a computer modeler in part because the whole field is BS
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:23.520]  from the ground up and the people in his own fields who said oh Neil is great
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:26.240]  we love Ferguson he's a genius and so forth
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:29.520]  they're patting themselves on the back because they want a job because they're
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:33.200]  in a field that's completely unscientific oh computer
[3:15:33.200 --> 3:15:36.800]  predictions yes and we're pulling down a paycheck and we have a
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:40.400]  university job so we have to pump up our profession
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:45.920]  and we choose to elevate Neil Schmuck Ferguson to the top of the list and say
[3:15:45.920 --> 3:15:50.720]  that he's a genius no he's a total failure a friggin failure
[3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:54.720]  in 2005 he said that bird flu could kill
[3:15:54.720 --> 3:16:00.720]  as many as 200 million people and the final official tally was
[3:16:00.720 --> 3:16:09.680]  several hundred and he used the same old-time structural model
[3:16:09.680 --> 3:16:14.720]  that he used in 2005 to predict the COVID-19 deaths
[3:16:14.720 --> 3:16:21.280]  in 2009 2020 but nobody bothered to figure that out or ask
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:25.520]  any questions Fauci said to Trump blah blah blah
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:30.240]  and somebody said to Boris Johnson blah blah blah and before you know it I said
[3:16:30.240 --> 3:16:33.920]  well I don't want to be responsible for all these deaths
[3:16:33.920 --> 3:16:38.400]  so the whole idea of just letting this go like an ordinary flu season
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:43.200]  and and working our way through it and keeping the world alive and the economy
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:47.040]  is alive is now verboten it's off the table
[3:16:47.040 --> 3:16:52.320]  we can't do it because too many people would die so we have to have lockdowns
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:55.680]  listen up you governors we want you to do this
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:17:00.560]  and that's how it happened and so this potato head Ferguson
[3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:07.840]  slunk off eventually by having uh exposed I think himself to the fact
[3:17:07.840 --> 3:17:11.600]  that he was having an ongoing affair with a married woman who was his
[3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:15.680]  mistress and she came to visit him during the lockdown
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:21.040]  oh he apologized me a culpa I broke my own rules so to speak
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:25.680]  and he disappeared and said he was quitting his official government
[3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:32.880]  job that's called pleading to a lesser charge
[3:17:32.880 --> 3:17:37.040]  no i'm not guilty of making a prediction that all kinds of people are gonna die
[3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:41.440]  and destroying the economy just here in the break I went and got a delicious cup
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:44.400]  a second cup of the day it's really strong I shouldn't do this
[3:17:44.400 --> 3:17:48.000]  because all work and no playmates jack a really aggressive boy and the coffee
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:50.560]  adds to it but wake up america coffee there by loves

[3:18:42.720 --> 3:18:47.280]  and your prayers and your word of mouth has been nothing short of historic
[3:18:47.280 --> 3:18:52.800]  and truly epic this is the battle for the future of humanity
[3:18:52.800 --> 3:18:56.480]  and now open world government is being established
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:19:02.720]  with an end game to depopulate the planet now the internal operations of the
[3:19:02.720 --> 3:19:08.240]  globalists are being externalized you must decide which side you're on
[3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:11.200]  living and denial having mass Stockholm syndrome
[3:19:11.200 --> 3:19:14.080]  learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery
[3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:18.960]  destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:24.240]  about not just a physical death the delusions must end now
[3:19:24.240 --> 3:19:28.720]  info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the
[3:19:28.720 --> 3:19:30.800]  enemy most people that are aware of the new
[3:19:30.800 --> 3:19:34.880]  order decide to join it out of fear they are truly fearless
[3:19:34.880 --> 3:19:38.320]  we must fight this or lose our souls

[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:23.600]  scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and
[3:20:23.600 --> 3:20:27.280]  delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way

[3:20:39.840 --> 3:20:58.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:03.920]  all right so the two main events that promoted this entire
[3:21:03.920 --> 3:21:12.400]  covid-19 farce false pandemic the chinese lockdowns
[3:21:12.400 --> 3:21:19.280]  the computer predictions of neil furgus now china is doing it again
[3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:22.000]  locking down
[3:21:22.880 --> 3:21:29.200]  just think about this china locks down 100 million people the first time
[3:21:29.200 --> 3:21:36.000]  a mere two months to three months later china is announcing that everything
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:39.520]  has been put back together in china everything is okay
[3:21:39.520 --> 3:21:45.280]  everybody's going back to work and all of a sudden
[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:50.160]  what china was doing is happening in the west
[3:21:50.160 --> 3:21:56.400]  all these other countries are locked down china is not locked down anymore
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:22:03.600]  boom it's like a stage magic trick here they are no they're not they're over
[3:22:03.600 --> 3:22:06.800]  here the lockdowns were there now guess what hey
[3:22:06.800 --> 3:22:12.800]  they're over here and don't you know you should
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:17.040]  what an inspiration it was as i said before the last break
[3:22:17.040 --> 3:22:20.480]  for china to have done that first gigantic lockdown
[3:22:20.480 --> 3:22:25.120]  because all the powers that be from bill gates to world health organization
[3:22:25.120 --> 3:22:29.840]  etc etc were rubbing their hands because that's what they wanted to do
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:34.000]  and the un wanted it and that was done in all these countries
[3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:40.640]  after china set the bar and showed the way
[3:22:41.440 --> 3:22:46.640]  amazing isn't it how that trick happened and now china is doing it again
[3:22:46.640 --> 3:22:50.720]  locking down and again we hear talk of the second wave
[3:22:50.720 --> 3:22:56.560]  of cobit 19 there is no second wave there was no first wave
[3:22:56.560 --> 3:23:00.080]  the whole thing is a fraud
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:04.880]  but they're going to try to piggyback on what china is doing now
[3:23:04.880 --> 3:23:08.240]  to lock down again
[3:23:08.880 --> 3:23:15.040]  more than is currently being locked down this country and other countries all
[3:23:15.040 --> 3:23:20.080]  around the world it's happening believe it's happening
[3:23:20.080 --> 3:23:26.640]  that's what they're trying to do that's what they want to do
[3:23:26.640 --> 3:23:32.160]  do you see any of these current protests across america
[3:23:32.160 --> 3:23:42.240]  even vaguely approaching the medical holocaust that's going on here
[3:23:42.240 --> 3:23:50.000]  any possible rub up against that of course not clueless completely
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:57.440]  you want to see some horrendous things that are being done to people of color
[3:23:57.440 --> 3:24:02.000]  go look at some of these hospitals where the treatment
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:09.120]  is unbelievable last week i talked about the treatment in elmhurst
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:14.400]  at the epicenter of the epicenter you've got doctors in new york you've got
[3:24:14.400 --> 3:24:17.040]  doctors in other places who are saying well
[3:24:17.040 --> 3:24:20.400]  we're just learning about the use of ventilators
[3:24:20.400 --> 3:24:23.600]  we didn't really know how to do it before
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:27.600]  and maybe some of these people don't need ventilators and
[3:24:27.600 --> 3:24:32.080]  and it's a learning process of course if people are dying like flies
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:36.800]  when we put them on ventilators and when we give them all kinds of heavy
[3:24:36.800 --> 3:24:44.560]  sedatives so they fall asleep under the ventilation and they never wake up
[3:24:44.560 --> 3:24:49.120]  yeah but we don't want to talk about that because
[3:24:49.120 --> 3:24:52.720]  we're on a learning curve you see we doctors
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:57.040]  we didn't know that one of the long-standing
[3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:00.160]  adverse effects of the use of ventilators
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:05.040]  is pneumonia in patients who are already supposedly suffering from lung
[3:25:05.040 --> 3:25:10.000]  conditions called covid we didn't know that too much
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:15.440]  pressure on the lungs could destroy the lungs really
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:19.360]  that's like saying we didn't know if you took a hammer and you smashed somebody
[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:23.680]  on the head that we could cause any damage
[3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:27.760]  we didn't know we're just learning we didn't realize that you could give
[3:25:27.760 --> 3:25:32.000]  people who have a shortness of breath that need oxygen
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:37.360]  other means of oxygen never heard of other ways of delivering oxygen
[3:25:37.360 --> 3:25:44.000]  than through a ventilator really you want to see some horrendous things
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:49.760]  going on in new york city in new york state
[3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:55.440]  where governor komo who's all of a sudden a genius doctor
[3:25:55.440 --> 3:26:02.720]  demands 30 000 ventilators be sent to new york to treat these
[3:26:02.720 --> 3:26:10.080]  patients what does he know he's a moron he knows nothing
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:14.080]  he's a potato head and if his name weren't komo
[3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:19.040]  he'd be shoveling sand in death valley
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:25.760]  where he belonged ditto for de Blasio the mayor of new york
[3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:30.720]  they don't know anything about medicine or science
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:35.600]  they're fascists that's what they are
[3:26:35.600 --> 3:26:40.160]  there's daddy mario compel
[3:26:42.720 --> 3:26:46.240]  so this is what's going on
[3:26:48.880 --> 3:26:54.160]  at the very beginning going back to the so-called discovery of the new virus
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:26:58.400]  that nobody has seen before which they over discover in about five minutes
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:27:03.520]  well we had an outbreak in Wuhan and the scientists said what is this we
[3:27:03.520 --> 3:27:06.800]  don't know we've got patients coming in with lung
[3:27:06.800 --> 3:27:11.360]  problems and pneumonia and whatever of course 300 000 people every year
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:15.280]  die of pneumonia in china which means they have millions of cases of pneumonia
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:19.520]  but we'll ignore that yeah yeah this is serious i wonder
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:23.520]  if it's going to be a new disease here
[3:27:23.520 --> 3:27:26.960]  the chinese researcher well we better call in the cdc in the world health
[3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:31.040]  organization big shot virus hunters to help us out here and whatever
[3:27:31.040 --> 3:27:34.880]  and here they are working away for 10 minutes in the lab
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:38.560]  and uh you know somebody would come in the room and tap them on the shoulder
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:42.400]  and say hey schmuck look out the window of the
[3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:46.480]  building what do you see well i don't see anything that's right
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:49.760]  you don't see anything you can't see across the street
[3:27:49.760 --> 3:27:53.920]  because the foul air has such deadly pollutants in it
[3:27:53.920 --> 3:27:58.320]  that people took to the streets last summer to protest it even though
[3:27:58.320 --> 3:28:02.480]  protests in china could get you arrested and disappeared and killed
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:07.120]  and you want to know what's causing lung problems in Wuhan
[3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:13.120]  and you're looking for a virus really isn't that wonderful and i bet you're
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:16.560]  going to find this new virus in about 10 minutes right
[3:28:16.560 --> 3:28:21.360]  yeah how did you know it's called uh let's call it cove to
[3:28:21.360 --> 3:28:27.760]  SARS COVID-19 and give it a nice fancy name and say
[3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:33.840]  nobody ever saw it before do a study on patients line up 500 or 1000
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:40.080]  that are supposed to have this epidemic and confirmed by some real test not a
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:44.880]  fake test that they all have this new virus that we never saw before
[3:28:44.880 --> 3:28:48.640]  no we're not going to do that we're just going to pick out anecdotally a few
[3:28:48.640 --> 3:28:52.320]  people here and there and say oh we sequenced the whole thing in the
[3:28:52.320 --> 3:28:57.040]  genetic blah blah blah and we got the new virus and everybody agrees
[3:28:57.040 --> 3:28:59.920]  and it's an epidemic and it's spreading and look
[3:28:59.920 --> 3:29:03.520]  Beijing just locked down 50 million people whoa okay

[3:34:23.600 --> 3:34:26.960]  show this is a real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:31.040]  out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't
[3:34:31.040 --> 3:34:35.040]  dry you out smells great it's so refreshing
[3:34:35.040 --> 3:34:38.960]  this is a big winner
[3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:46.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:58.240 --> 3:35:01.920]  so how do you think china is looking
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:07.360]  at the u.s right now chinese government i'm talking about the regime
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:11.760]  i think they're feeling any sympathy kidding
[3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:15.280]  oh well we locked down 100 billion people the first time and look what
[3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:20.400]  happened in the in the u.s so they locked down
[3:35:20.400 --> 3:35:26.560]  everybody we went back to work they did let's try it again
[3:35:26.560 --> 3:35:32.240]  let's see what happens again let's have a second wave what do we care
[3:35:32.240 --> 3:35:36.320]  we'll call it a second wave a new outbreak or whatever
[3:35:36.320 --> 3:35:43.040]  chinese government considers all their citizens to be completely disposable
[3:35:43.040 --> 3:35:49.280]  let's get that straight whatever it is they're 1.2 1.3 billion people
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:54.720]  if they lose a few million do you think the chinese regime really cares
[3:35:54.720 --> 3:35:57.440]  no they don't
[3:35:58.080 --> 3:36:02.720]  so they're just looking at well look what a tremendous effect it had on our
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:06.800]  enemy the first time when we locked down 100 billion 50 million
[3:36:06.800 --> 3:36:13.200]  they did the lockdown and gee that was fortunate by accident
[3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:17.680]  just happened to lock down america following in our footsteps and
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:22.320]  england and germany and all these other countries
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:29.360]  who are basically our enemies isn't that good for us yeah
[3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:37.280]  so let's try it again another lockdown yeah face a new lockdown a second wave
[3:36:37.280 --> 3:36:43.200]  there's no second wave the tests okay cover this before the tests are
[3:36:43.200 --> 3:36:47.760]  complete frauds the so-called PCR test that's been
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:54.000]  used widely all over the world quite expensive
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:59.440]  doesn't tell you whether a person is sick or is going to get sick never did
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:03.920]  never will cover this in extreme details before
[3:37:03.920 --> 3:37:11.120]  on the show here on my website even quoted their own
[3:37:11.120 --> 3:37:18.000]  their own reports world health organization fda cdc admitting tests
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:22.480]  are flawed even a positive test indicating the
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:27.520]  presence of the virus does not necessarily indicate infectious
[3:37:27.520 --> 3:37:34.160]  virus or cause of disease well then what are you doing the test for
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:38.320]  antibody test riddled with false positives
[3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:43.520]  cross reactions as they're called to any manner of other things
[3:37:43.520 --> 3:37:49.360]  covered that as well renders all the case numbers based on those tests
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:54.560]  completely meaningless completely meaningless
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:38:00.160]  easy to fabricate just make it up in the hospitals they write COVID-19 on
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:04.240]  people's folders on their death certificates
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:09.200]  they make more money that way in the hospitals they're going broke
[3:38:09.200 --> 3:38:13.680]  etc etc even when they're not doing it for that reason
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:20.640]  it's easier eyeball diagnosis many of the doctors are true believers well
[3:38:20.640 --> 3:38:26.000]  elevated temperature apparent lung problems who must be COVID no it must
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:30.080]  not be COVID could be flu could be anything
[3:38:30.080 --> 3:38:37.840]  air pollution whatever bad vaccine a million other things
[3:38:37.840 --> 3:38:44.080]  she's how these stupid man how stupid do you have to be
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:49.440]  as a doctor to go along with this crap

[3:38:53.440 --> 3:38:57.920]  training and background and so forth yeah so why are they so
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:39:02.800]  stupid then and such robots that they go along with
[3:39:02.800 --> 3:39:07.440]  this insanity to say nothing of course of the

[3:40:08.560 --> 3:40:11.760]  what they're talking about
