[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  From the front lines, from the front lines of the information war,
[00:29.000 --> 00:36.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:36.000 --> 00:47.000]  Right and wrong. New World Order.
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.000]  As soon as they got rid of Snyderman, this clearly protecting old Weinstein,
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  the big dirty house of cards began tumbling down.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  We're going to navigate it all here today.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  They're going to try to use men hitting on women in creepy ways, like Morgan Friedman does,
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  to equate that with rape. And James Cahn has popped in and made a great point on that.
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  That's all coming up. But first, raping women, raping men,
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  that is only the tip of the fetid, stinking Hollywood devil worship, iceberg,
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  the Satanism, the sex abuse, the abuse of children, the sacrifice of children.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  That's all coming out with record arrest of pedophiles.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  And now families are fighting back suing over MKUltra,
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  including sexual torture of children, more than 20,000 of them.
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  The dam is breaking. Leanne McAdoo reports.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  While some squabble about just who has ruined the reputation of intelligence agencies
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  following revelations the Deep State used a human informant to spy on the Trump campaign,
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  others ask if agencies like the CIA ever had a good reputation in the first place.
[02:02.000 --> 02:09.000]  Survivors and families of those victimized by a secret CIA mind control program, MKUltra,
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  are preparing a class action lawsuit against the U.S. and Quebec governments
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  due to the alleged abuse they suffered through decades ago.
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000]  Over 40 Canadians who unknowingly became MKUltra patients at the Allen Memorial Institute,
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  where MKUltra sub-project 68 took place,
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  gathered in Montreal last weekend to share their horrific stories about how MKUltra destroyed their lives.
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.000]  As early as 1953, then-CIA director Alan Dulles authorized the MKUltra program.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  Julie Vanderpeer reports that Project MKUltra was a large-scale attempt by the CIA
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  to research behavioral modification and the effects of certain drugs and psychological treatments on the human mind.
[02:52.000 --> 02:58.000]  It consisted of 144 different sub-projects related to the control of human behavior,
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  which were carried out in 89 different institutions, including universities.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  Among its most notorious tests were those involving LSD.
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.000]  The agency hoped it would be some sort of a truth serum they could use to secretly manipulate and control foreign leaders
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  or else make interrogation subjects speak more freely.
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  After witnessing a handful of Americans captured during the Korean War exhibiting behaviors of brainwashing,
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  the CIA, too, wanted to understand mind control.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  So the project then spread into Canada, where a Scottish-born psychiatrist, Ewan Cameron,
[03:32.000 --> 03:39.000]  was trying to discover whether doctors could erase a person's mind and then reprogram new patterns of behavior.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  Patients initially entered the program at the Allen Memorial Institute,
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  seeking treatment for mild mental health issues like anxiety or depression,
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  but were quickly administered cocktails of powerful hallucinogenic substances
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.000]  and subjected to bizarre psychological experiments under the supervision of Dr. Cameron,
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  who later became the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association.
[04:01.000 --> 04:09.000]  The Guardian reports that MK ultrapatiants of Dr. Cameron's were subjected to high-voltage electroshock therapy several times a day,
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  forced into drug-induced sleeps that could last months, and injected with mega doses of LSD.
[04:15.000 --> 04:23.000]  After reducing them to a childlike state, at times stripping them of basic skills such as how to dress themselves or tie their shoes,
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  Cameron would attempt to reprogram them by bombarding them with recorded messages for up to 16 hours at a time.
[04:29.000 --> 04:36.000]  Montreal lawyer Alan Stein, who is representing the collective of MKUltra survivors of the Allen Memorial Institute,
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  says he believes the survivors have a case.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  A CIA auditor's report from 1957 shows the agency wasn't concerned with protecting the patients.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  Instead, it sought to conceal the inhumane experimentation from the public.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  Concerning MKUltra, Esquire's Charles P. Pierce summed it up thusly,
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  Americans are capable of terrible things, particularly if they're employed by the CIA.
[05:00.000 --> 05:11.000]  I'm so excited. The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[05:11.000 --> 05:20.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[05:20.000 --> 05:26.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules,
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[05:44.000 --> 05:50.000]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  It is amazing.
[05:53.000 --> 06:00.000]  Red pill, now available at m4warsstore.com, and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.000]  Now! They think you're a goldfish!
[06:05.000 --> 06:11.000]  I've been betting on you my whole life! I believe in you! I don't think you're stupid!
[06:11.000 --> 06:17.000]  One man and a rich, beloved, old genitals are cut off,
[06:17.000 --> 06:22.000]  and we're kicking these trainers' asses politically, and we're not backing down at her.
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  I want to get these people! We're waiting! I can feel the spirit rising. Can't you?
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  We have broken their back! Yes, I can feel it!
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  Let's go!
[06:36.000 --> 06:43.000]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[06:43.000 --> 06:50.000]  Vengeance is coming! Fire is coming!
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.000]  The real revolution against you is coming, and you will burn in hell!
[06:57.000 --> 07:07.000]  I'm picking up a fake transmission light. I think it's all the shields coming.
[07:07.000 --> 07:15.000]  But here's the good news, Chumps! You think you're going to assassinate Trump?
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  You can bully a bunch of us if we're going along with you.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  I'd like to observe how hot it's going.
[07:23.000 --> 07:31.000]  We're going to have to fight 21 at this point, and only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW Globalist George Soros' droppings.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  Stabilize it, George!
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  Hillary Clinton, it's the new world order, and Michael Moore, go back to Haiti!
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  Where are you from?
[07:39.000 --> 07:47.000]  We're awake, and you're not putting us back in the coma. You got that, Jack? You're done! It's over! What do I want?
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  Get him back! Get him back!
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  Do you think there was more than one transmission light?
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  For sure. I'm picking up a computer.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shields with fully automated environments.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.000]  Clear.
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  Oh, what do you mean?
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, the 25th day of May 2018. I'm going to be here for the next four hours.
[08:15.000 --> 08:23.000]  We've got the War Room coming up with Owen Shroyer, and he's going to be joined by a co-host today for the full three hours.
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.000]  That is Craig Shroyer, former Navy SEAL in the DEV group, and a patriot.
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  His buddy and teammate has got the Congressional Medal of Honor yesterday, so that'll be interesting to discuss on air.
[08:38.000 --> 08:51.000]  I'm going to get that fellow on. Owen Shroyer and Craig Shroyer are going to host the Veterans Call-In Show, a voice for our veterans.
[08:51.000 --> 09:00.000]  They're going to take three hours of intense calls for veterans in active duty only going into Memorial Day weekend.
[09:00.000 --> 09:08.000]  And I have decided, because it's Memorial Day, I want to focus on veterans as well, so I'm going to come in and do the Sunday show live.
[09:08.000 --> 09:18.000]  4 to 6 p.m., most folks will be taking off, but I will be here this weekend because I want to focus on we're entering a post-human military.
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  And that's going to sound good to a lot of people, but that's like the debate NASA had the last 20 years and said,
[09:24.000 --> 09:31.000]  well, we don't want space exploration to be human, that's too dangerous, it's too costly, it's going to be robots.
[09:31.000 --> 09:39.000]  We have to build a world for, of, and by humans, and then use robots and other things as an extension.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  But everything's being set up where it's a post-human future.
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  That is the stated global compact of the Fortune 100.
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.000]  And that's what Elon Musk has warned you about. It's what Bill Joy has warned you about.
[09:55.000 --> 10:02.000]  It's what the Unabomber who was in the MKUltra mind control program as a volunteer, Theodore Kaczynski has warned you about.
[10:02.000 --> 10:11.000]  And, you know, he thought just bomb technology heads and cause a revolution against technology because he thinks there's no way to adopt all this and survive.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  He's in a supermax prison right now.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  And the reason I mentioned MKUltra is there's a lot of lawsuits that have been filed.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  In fact, I meant to get to that on like Tuesday and I didn't. Can you guys pull me that out of the stack?
[10:24.000 --> 10:38.000]  And also yesterday's stack on where to get into of the declassification of the CIA running the media in the 60s and ordering them to use the term conspiracy theory to criticize anyone exposing the planetary plan.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  I thought we should show all this for people.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  It's all coming out right now. And a lot of it's because Trump is in office.
[10:46.000 --> 11:08.000]  But make no mistake, when you hear about Weinstein being indicted for multiple felony counts of rape and sexual abuse torture, basically, that's all because of the American people standing up to the media, to Hollywood, to the bullies, and getting Donald John Trump elected.
[11:08.000 --> 11:26.000]  Now, I told you from CIA, MI6, Army, Navy, Marine Corps sources, many of which have been on the show by name, that Trump's one of his main planks was going after sex trafficking.
[11:26.000 --> 11:43.000]  And not just the Garden Variety, but the Harvey Weinstein on the plane of the Alita Express owner who has been convicted of trafficking young girls to his slave island.
[11:43.000 --> 11:59.000]  That Obama went to, that Bill Clinton went to, that they all go to, and now Richard Branson's private island had the nexium sex cult women, an entire group of hundreds of them on it, to quote, try to get him to join the cult.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  I'm just telling you, that's what's going on on these islands, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:03.000 --> 12:22.000]  I've talked to people in Hollywood that haven't given me details years ago, but that's how I'm on record saying they torture women, that they're on record putting them through mind control, because I've been told that by famous actresses and famous actors in Hollywood that they're running mind control operations.
[12:22.000 --> 12:35.000]  And that it's a branch of the CIA, but really the Alistair Crowley cult, through Jack Parsons and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, taught Hollywood all this in the 50s and 60s and set it up.
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  And that's in main line history. That's in major newspapers.
[12:40.000 --> 12:55.000]  So Katie Bar the door, you need to understand this Weinstein thing, he reportedly, according to his driver and his longtime assistant, raped dozens of women in front of them.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  He liked about 95 pound women that looked like they were 15.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  They'd be 16, 17, 18.
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  He'd pen them in the, in the, in the limo and rape them.
[13:07.000 --> 13:18.000]  And I'm not going to go into the rest of the stuff that's even been documented, but it's exactly what these guys like is a beautiful young woman.
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  I'm not, I'm not even going to say it, just, just they like to humiliate women, just like they like to hurt children.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  Now, Weinstein has not been implicated from any of my sources.
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  There's underage stuff going on, which is bad enough, but the pedophilia has not popped up on my Intel radar with him.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  But with a lot of the other folks, that's the case.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  So he's been smirking outside going in.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  He wasn't smirking once he was in handcuffs, getting marched out of there.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  So that's all coming up.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  But I told you this was happening.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  There's like an eight-fold arrest of child traffickers, pedophiles.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  We're not talking about people that just have some child porn.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  We're talking about the producers of it.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  And it's happening all over the country.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  And that's why the Democrats are so rattled.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  Because their extortion system is based on this.
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  And Trump knows all about it from, who did I tell you back in November last year?
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  Five days before the election, two days before he went public in Breitbart.
[14:13.000 --> 14:21.000]  I was told by high-level people in the CIA and Pentagon that Eric Princh was quarterbacking this move with Trump to bring down the pedophiles.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  Now, I didn't know that was true for my sources, though they've been really accurate.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  Three, four days later, he's in Breitbart saying, yes, it's true.
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  So credit goes for credit to do.
[14:31.000 --> 14:40.000]  Eric Princh, yes, the former founder of Blackwater, that the left demonizes and says, is this horrible person all day?
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  Why is that the case?
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  Why did Blackwater get blamed for all this stuff that other mercenary groups did?
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  Because now I know.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  Now I understand the bigger picture.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  So that's what's really happening here, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  And so just you heard it here first and it's all been confirmed.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  So there you go.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  So thanks to Eric Princh.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  Thanks to all our other sources.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  And we are so close right now to this whole house of cards coming down.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  And if you bring down Weinstein, it blows the door open on all of it.
[15:11.000 --> 15:19.000]  So they're trying to red herring and smoke screen as hard as they can with, oh, Morgan Friedman hit on women on the set.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  Oh, you know, another Hollywood guy hugged the girl too hard.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  Or Prairie Day companion, the woman hugged him and her shirt went up and he touched her back.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  Oh my gosh, that's not torturing little kids.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  That's not raping women.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  And don't compare the two to it.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  And I'm not defending Morgan Friedman.
[15:40.000 --> 15:49.000]  He's a total sellout to those stupid arrest, you know, Trump TV pieces he did with that idiot Rob Reiner, meathead, who says we're in a civil war.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  Yeah, we are in one and you're getting your butt kicked.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  So keep censoring, keep pushing, we're bringing you down right now.
[15:55.000 --> 16:21.000]  The transmission goes into overdrive straight ahead.
[16:21.000 --> 16:32.000]  It's true, and you can do it too. These are just two of the secrets revealed inside a stunning new book from the Palm Beach Research Group and Ted Benna, the man behind the 401k.

[19:59.000 --> 20:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:11.000 --> 20:24.000]  There's a need for new world order, but it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[20:24.000 --> 20:32.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  Well, North Korea has blown up their nuclear site a few days ago. They've released the video.
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  That is a big victory for America and Trump, even if the summit's been canceled for now.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  That's just part of the negotiation process due to John Bolton and others trying to sabotage things.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  But we'll continue to track that and play that video coming up in the next segment.
[20:53.000 --> 21:01.000]  We're also going to continue to track what's happening in the economy and with these new privacy rules that Europe has put in place
[21:01.000 --> 21:10.000]  that are not really actually designed to protect your privacy because they're going to continue mass spying and all the rest of it and big data.
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  It's designed to basically have an internet war and try to take regulatory control of the internet over from the United States
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  and then transfer it to Europe and the UN. And George Soros and others are a big supporter of it.
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.000]  Facebook and Google hit with 8.8 billion in lawsuits on day one of GDPR.
[21:31.000 --> 21:36.000]  And boy, we've been preparing for months for this. We already had a lot of the opt-out systems for folks.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  But the way the internet's been designed is all of this tracking.
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  I mean, that's how when you have an account say on Discus or Disgust to be able to post.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  It knows what you did in the past, how you've operated because it has cookies. It's the very nature of it.
[21:49.000 --> 21:58.000]  The issue is that it's all being tied together with larger databases by governments and megacorporations to then track everything you're doing.
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  And Communist China has come out and here's the big secret that the EU's not talking about.
[22:05.000 --> 22:13.000]  It's not a secret what China's doing. China's got their big social score that ties systems way beyond what Google and Facebook are doing together
[22:13.000 --> 22:21.000]  with the real world with live time cameras via a company called Skynet to track what you do in live time
[22:21.000 --> 22:29.000]  and then ban you from traveling, getting a job, being able to buy food if you're not a good servant of the Communist Party.
[22:29.000 --> 22:40.000]  Are we hearing any lawsuits from the EU and from Yunker, the unelected dictator of the EU?
[22:40.000 --> 22:47.000]  The permanent bureaucracy. Are we hearing anything from them?
[22:47.000 --> 22:53.000]  See, that's how information warfare really works. That's why this broadcast is hated.
[22:53.000 --> 23:03.000]  Because we enter new devastating paradigm interpretations that no one else is engaged in.
[23:03.000 --> 23:12.000]  Because I started thinking about this a few weeks ago and I looked into it and we have not seen the EU do anything to China.
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  Because remember, the internet's all tied together in a global system.
[23:16.000 --> 23:26.000]  So they're trying to put forward the most draconian regulations in the name of peace and security and free speech and privacy and protecting our identity.
[23:26.000 --> 23:33.000]  And they immediately attack the United States and there's nothing about China.
[23:33.000 --> 23:46.000]  And then I search Engend it and no one has pointed out yet that China is being left alone even though China and its websites, Alibaba and millions and millions of others
[23:46.000 --> 23:55.000]  are operating in levels of data mining and scraping and identity theft that boggles the brain.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  They have a mark of the beast, global social credit.
[23:59.000 --> 24:18.000]  Apple has moved there and given the state the keys to the kingdom of your Apple ID to be able to access that entire system of the entire Apple world of what you've done.
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  Oh, Apple doesn't let you opt out of that, do they?
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  See?
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  Oh, so Communist China can do whatever they want.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  Because oh, because the Chinese dictator, he's now officially been made a dictator who was already appointed by the Communist Party that would vote for him.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  But then the Communist Party would decide who could, quote, run via the Central Committee.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  But now he's just president for life and his vice president was made vice president for life.
[24:48.000 --> 24:59.000]  He's officially a died-in-the-wool dictator, meaning he dictates.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  And he's got control of most of the Internet. China is winning the war for the web.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  And I've talked to the Cyber Command people, I've talked to the NSA people here at UT, I've talked to them all and they're like, no, you're right.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  And all Trump's doing is trying to desperately do something so he's told the Chinese you can't officially run UT.
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  That was in the Washington Post.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  It's unbelievable. Yeah, they're singing in. Apple under fire for moving iCloud data to China.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  I was the first person. I'm not even bragging to freak out about this.
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.000]  The original Reuters article was just China's moving to, Apple's moving to China.
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  And then I've read further and I'm like, they're going to move the cloud data there?
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  That means the code keys. I'm not even an engineer and I know that.
[25:46.000 --> 25:59.000]  And then of course, a week later, that's what scares me is that I continue nine times out of ten to be the first person that actually even understands what's happening here.
[25:59.000 --> 26:10.000]  At least publicly, there are tons of people in tech and in government that know all this too, but they just no one writes about it.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  I remember learning in Hollywood six, seven years ago that China controlled all six of the big studios.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  I talked about it on air and man, all the white supremacists flipped out because they're obsessed with Jews.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  And they went, Jones says, China runs Hollywood. How ridiculous.
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  I'm talking about who came in and bought control of it.
[26:30.000 --> 26:38.000]  I'm not saying there aren't a bunch of people who are Jewish and Italian and whatever in Hollywood that are directors and producers.
[26:38.000 --> 26:46.000]  But the Communist Chinese own Hollywood now. That's been all over the news.
[26:46.000 --> 26:55.000]  And so I'm watching China take over and I mean the Communist Party of China and I'm watching them take control the whole world.
[26:55.000 --> 27:05.000]  And then, oh my gosh, U.S. companies should hit with billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[27:05.000 --> 27:13.000]  And it's all to set the precedent with Americans that, oh, at least they're going after the big tech guys that are bad who deserve it, which they kind of do.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  But the next is going to be all the small sites you watch. They've already announced it.
[27:17.000 --> 27:30.000]  They're coming after the Internet in America using the EU all draconianly implemented and China is exempt because the Chinese dictator, he went to Davos 15 months ago last year.
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  And he said, I will hold the New World Order up. I will hold the Euro up. We will defeat Trump.
[27:36.000 --> 27:44.000]  And Junker shook his hand and said, quote, we're going to have a trade war with America and we're going to remove Trump and we're going to defeat America.
[27:44.000 --> 27:54.000]  That was in the foreign news, a hereditary grandson of the most powerful Nazi family in Germany, the Junkers, the damn bombers were called Junkers.
[27:54.000 --> 28:13.000]  The ammunition factories, everything. Junker, he told us, I'm going to defeat you in Hollywood and the Communist Chinese and the Islamist and the EU and the Chai comms are all against us.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  And the average leftist doesn't even know it, doesn't even care and thinks I'm the enemy.
[28:17.000 --> 28:29.000]  What all we're trying to do with Trump is save something, you idiots. We've been completely overrun. We have been completely sold out, you fools.
[28:29.000 --> 28:37.000]  You got SOB Nazis telling us that they're going to defeat us.
[28:37.000 --> 28:47.000]  Well, just like you were arrogant before, you're going to get your ass handed to you, Junker, and your Chinese Communist dictator and that Nazi collaborator Soros, you are all going to pay.
[28:47.000 --> 29:09.000]  You're going to get beat. America will defeat you. Russia will defeat you. You're going to get your asses kicked politically. We know what's going on now.
[29:09.000 --> 29:31.000]  You have been lied to.
[29:31.000 --> 29:41.000]  My name is Kevin Ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer. Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:47.000 --> 30:01.000]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are. This is critical to get, to read, to give them the library, to give them the church, to get them right now at killingunclesambook.com.
[30:01.000 --> 30:17.000]  I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products. We have it in Fuller's life. It take hours. Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida. It's back in stock.
[30:17.000 --> 30:31.000]  Real red pill. It's been sold out for months. It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body. Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids. So you can upload it.
[30:31.000 --> 30:51.000]  Silver and iodine four to five toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle. That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you.
[30:51.000 --> 30:59.000]  It's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[30:59.000 --> 31:17.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[31:17.000 --> 31:37.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[31:37.000 --> 31:51.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[31:51.000 --> 32:00.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[32:00.000 --> 32:07.000]  Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by Infowars Life.
[32:07.000 --> 32:20.000]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia fruit and flax fiber.
[32:20.000 --> 32:31.000]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system.
[32:31.000 --> 32:38.000]  Infowars Life's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[32:38.000 --> 32:53.000]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[32:53.000 --> 33:09.000]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[33:23.000 --> 33:41.000]  You are not the president. No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[33:41.000 --> 33:52.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[33:52.000 --> 34:12.000]  Have you noticed that there's all this yelling and screaming and squawking and there's black leaders I've seen on CNN, MSNBC saying the founding fathers gave us the right to free speech, which they didn't, they just pointed out a right that already existed.
[34:12.000 --> 34:26.000]  And the NFL players, they have a right to kneel. How dare the NFL say they've got to stay in the locker room. They've got to stay in the fieldhouse. They've got to stay in the dugout.
[34:26.000 --> 34:34.000]  They've got to stay in their barracks and they can come out later if they don't want to stay off the National Anthem.
[34:34.000 --> 34:44.000]  Well, number one, they sign a contract that says that and the contract says they're entertainers and the ticket says it's entertainment.
[34:44.000 --> 34:53.000]  It's actually a blood sport, but that's entertainment too. They're modern gladiators. Some of the NFL acting like they don't know that it causes brain damage.
[34:53.000 --> 35:09.000]  The average NFLer dies at age 54. Yeah, I'd say that's gladiators. But the NFL gets all political loses about 45% of their viewers in the last three years.
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  So now they're in panic mode, just like Hollywood lost 30, 40% of its revenue. The same thing across the board. People are sick of it.
[35:17.000 --> 35:30.000]  They're sick of the virtue signaling. They're sick of the political messaging, the anti-American, anti-family garbage. I don't care what Netflix show it is, I try to watch.
[35:30.000 --> 35:39.000]  Or Deadpool 2, you name it, it is just hammering you with anti-family, anti-American garbage.
[35:39.000 --> 35:49.000]  And so they've been dropping 15, 20 points, putting on which poll you look at the last three years running. Some numbers have them down 57%, 60%, but it's about 45%.
[35:49.000 --> 35:58.000]  That is devastating to them. So the Hollywood crew and the propagandists, they kind of tell everybody which direction to go.
[35:58.000 --> 36:09.000]  And then the NFL gets on board and Jerry Jones was the first once he tried that kneeling thing and it blew up in his face to say, we got to stop this.
[36:09.000 --> 36:19.000]  But just think of the hypocrisy. Yes, they can go kneel outside of the stadium. They can go kneel on TV interviews. They can go call a press conference and kneel all day.
[36:19.000 --> 36:33.000]  But if part of, say, working in Info Wars as the company is that you've got to stand during the company song, that's part of working there.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  We don't have a company song. We don't do that. But there are some companies that actually have that.
[36:38.000 --> 36:45.000]  There are some companies that say you've got to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance every morning or you've got to stand for the Marine Corps battle him.
[36:45.000 --> 36:55.000]  Whatever it is, you work at that company. As long as it's not bizarre, illegal, whatever you have to follow what the company's doing.
[36:55.000 --> 37:09.000]  So the poor babies are paid what on average about $8 million a year. They want to grandstand that moron Kaepernick who sued the NFL because they cut him later because he sucked.
[37:09.000 --> 37:18.000]  He became so political he wasn't doing well. He was throwing all these interceptions and then he got cut. First he got benched and he got cut.
[37:18.000 --> 37:34.000]  And then he sued. I've only made $80 million or $89 million. He's been paid already. I only got $89 million. The racist white people are hurting me.
[37:34.000 --> 37:42.000]  So there you go. And the reason I'm digressing off into this is it's total and complete hypocrisy.
[37:42.000 --> 37:54.000]  When you've got Google and Twitter and Facebook and YouTube engaged in massive, complete, total censorship of conservatives, libertarians, veterans groups, Christians, pro-gun groups, you name it.
[37:54.000 --> 38:09.000]  Anybody right of Hillary Clinton? They testify before Congress they're doing it. Then Zuckerberg goes before the EU parliament and denies he's doing it. It's incredible.
[38:09.000 --> 38:16.000]  When he was caught in a hot mic a few years ago telling Merkel he would censor everybody that criticized open borders and the Islamic invasion.
[38:16.000 --> 38:30.000]  He did that. He called the police on them. They hired former Stasi people at Facebook four years ago to call the police on people that criticize Islam.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  So is it that the chickens coming home to roost?
[38:37.000 --> 38:49.000]  Aren't even left. They're a bunch of authoritarian corporatists like the Nazis had their ideology. They have their trendy ideology and they don't even understand the larger game they're playing.
[38:49.000 --> 38:57.000]  And then now the EU just came in after Zuckerberg and Google and everybody went along with their censorship and helped them.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  They're now allied with the Communist China and their dictator.
[39:00.000 --> 39:13.000]  And China isn't being hit with any GDPR because China won't put up with it. China won't pay it. China doesn't have 20 million lawyers. They're a dictatorship.
[39:13.000 --> 39:24.000]  Now it's only going to be the EU coming after US companies hiding behind the fact that they're doing it for people's privacy when that's complete balderdash.
[39:24.000 --> 39:30.000]  They spy on their entire population, EU-wide, probably worse than the United States.
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.000]  And they're allied with the Chinese Communist dictator.
[39:36.000 --> 39:45.000]  And we are in a two-way trade war with China and the EU. They are teamed up against us. Even CNBC says that.
[39:45.000 --> 39:52.000]  So I'm going to say it again very slowly to the listeners that are establishment or that are new.
[39:52.000 --> 40:00.000]  You can be delusional if you want and think I'm wrong about any of this.
[40:00.000 --> 40:08.000]  But the crook search engines, two people back there in live time, everything I say, and they're just pulling it up in live time.
[40:08.000 --> 40:15.000]  I told you last segment the EU and China are in a trade war with us to destroy us.
[40:15.000 --> 40:23.000]  And that it's criminal because it's under the WTO rules. You can't do that. You can't exempt China and others and then only attack us.
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.000]  That's what Trump's upset about. And the left is sheer leading against America.
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  And it's disgusting and it's dangerous and it's bad.
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  And then meanwhile, we've got NFL players making $8 million a year on average,
[40:38.000 --> 40:45.000]  typing and complaining that their speech has been taken when their speech has not been taken.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  I can use cuss words all day at night if I want to at home.
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.000]  But if I work at a company and they have a policy against profanity and I go around the office cussing like a sailor, they can fire me.
[40:56.000 --> 41:05.000]  Is that violating my free speech? No, it's not.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  In the middle of the country, valoviktorians, salutatorians are being told they're being given lists.
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.000]  It's in the news. You cannot talk about Christ. You cannot talk about God. You cannot talk about Christianity.
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.000]  Oh, they can have Satanism clubs at all the schools now. Many of them have those. You can have whatever you want.
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.000]  But you don't have the right to say Jesus in a commencement even though it's your speech and totally protected.
[41:23.000 --> 41:31.000]  That's the left, allied worldwide, Hollywood, the chai comms, the radical Islamists, the EU.
[41:31.000 --> 41:41.000]  It's all allied against everyone's free speech and individual free market capitalism because they're global corporate combines coming in using authoritarianism to centralize control.
[41:41.000 --> 41:50.000]  This is the great 21st century war. It's here. And if people could just understand it, we'll win it. And Trump understands it.
[41:50.000 --> 41:57.000]  So all of you left this, Trump is doing policies that any mainline analyst admits really will help the average person.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  He's fighting as hard as he can for you and this country. And a lot of leftists think it's dumb to be a nationalist.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  They go, oh, that's all backwards and whatever. Well, what is the global government?
[42:06.000 --> 42:14.000]  It's the EU and communist China and a bunch of megabanks allied with a 1.8. I keep saying 1.3. That's all numbers.
[42:14.000 --> 42:22.000]  1.8 billion Muslims. That was 1.35 years ago. It's 1.8 now.
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  Game over, man. Game over.
[42:28.000 --> 42:36.000]  It's insane. By the way, I'm going to come back from breaking it. Most important news yet. We got a bunch of guests coming up. I want to put the phones up as well.

[47:22.000 --> 47:46.000]  We've got live footage of the U.S. Naval Academy commencement and it's been going for like an hour with President Trump shaking hands, but it just ended with Trump hugging, I guess, the last sailor that came through.
[47:46.000 --> 47:56.000]  I know we're recording with satellite feeds, it says record on there, maybe we can back that up, because it's just that image of like an hour of Trump shaking hands.
[47:56.000 --> 48:05.000]  It's amazing, you know, part of us being a real TV network that we're launching is we've got all these dozens of satellite feeds of satellite dishes and uplinks and everything.
[48:05.000 --> 48:15.000]  It's crazy watching all these raw feeds of volcanoes and missile tests and Trump speeches you never see on the news. It's amazing.
[48:15.000 --> 48:25.000]  But that image of him, I mean, when did you see Obama shaking everybody's hand at a commencement? I don't think he did that, or hugging people.
[48:25.000 --> 48:34.000]  The people wanting to hug the president, because we went to that like a second too late for you to see him hugging the last person coming to the line.
[48:34.000 --> 48:44.000]  Just that personal touch, the way Trump one time called my wife just to tell her how great I was.
[48:44.000 --> 48:54.000]  And that's just a classy thing to do. And you know, my wife treats me really good, but ever since that little five minute conversation or whatever, she's treated me even that much better.
[48:54.000 --> 49:01.000]  It's just that magic, and it's not the celebrity of it, it's the fact that he really does that.
[49:01.000 --> 49:09.000]  Hundreds of calls, every time a cop gets killed, he calls the family, and then a lot of times sends a sizable donation.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  And of course, no one ever even knows about that, because Trump demands that they're not be told about it, but that's what Trump does.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  You talk about Mr. Classy, he's it. His wife, Mrs. Classy.
[49:19.000 --> 49:26.000]  And so here we've backed this up, we see he hugs the last person, he might know him, but it's just those little things like that.
[49:26.000 --> 49:34.000]  And this country has been taken over by the globalists, by the communist Chinese, it was being demoralized, it was being deindustrialized by design.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  Lloyd Blankfein, just a year ago, was saying, you'll never reboot America, you're going to fail Trump.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  Well, notice he's out at Goldman Sachs.
[49:41.000 --> 49:50.000]  Trump is really using the power of the executive to break heads, and that's why the media owned by the globalists is so mad, because Trump isn't even trying to destroy the globalist.
[49:50.000 --> 50:01.000]  He's just saying, you're not going to break America's back, you are not going to sit there and totally shut this country down.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  He just says, this is this is pragmatically stupid. I love America.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  Well, it has to fall for the global system.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  He's like, no, it's not going to fall.
[50:10.000 --> 50:20.000]  So all of you rooting against Trump and against me and against the republic and against free market, look at Venezuela, look at North Korea, look at communism.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  It doesn't work.
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.000]  Look at the big corporations being tax exempt.
[50:25.000 --> 50:33.000]  And Bloomberg, who's famous for avoiding almost all of his taxes along with Bill Gates and Ted Turner and all these people.
[50:33.000 --> 50:45.000]  When you when you avoid hundreds of billions in taxes and only pay 0.3% like Google, you're a philanthropist, you're a philanthropic organization.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  Think about that.
[50:46.000 --> 50:57.000]  And you wonder why they're all in charge and just get bigger and bigger and why we went from, you know, 1% having 40% of the wealth to like 1% having 70% of the wealth.
[50:57.000 --> 51:04.000]  And it's because that one tenth of one tenth of 1% really has almost all the wealth.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  The 1% is a lie.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  All the kingpin liberals pay almost nothing.
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.000]  And then Bloomberg says poor people should pay more tax.
[51:15.000 --> 51:22.000]  But he's not the Mitt Romney argument of if poor people paid more taxes, they wouldn't want higher taxes.
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.000]  No, no, no.
[51:23.000 --> 51:27.000]  He wants you dependent, but says the tax money makes your life better.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  He said, have higher taxes or die.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  Was the quote.
[51:32.000 --> 51:39.000]  But he knows full well that the top 1% pays most of the taxes.
[51:39.000 --> 51:47.000]  But see, that's not the top 0.00000024.
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  It's the 99 plus percent of the 1% that pays most of the taxes.
[51:52.000 --> 52:02.000]  But if you're making $250,000 a year, you're in the 1% see, but if you're making 12 billion a day like Jeff Bezos, oh, then your tax exempt.
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  See the big trick.
[52:03.000 --> 52:13.000]  And so they've got the general public thing and somebody making a half mill a year paying 40% federal tax.
[52:13.000 --> 52:19.000]  Only keeping a couple hundred thousand dollars of the money is the rich people that have to be gotten.
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  The ultra rich are really smart.
[52:22.000 --> 52:28.000]  They know how to manipulate the poor people against the middle class, which is their way out of it.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  All right.
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  Coming up, we're going to get more into Weinstein the purple walk.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  We're going to get into the attack on the First Amendment.
[52:37.000 --> 52:46.000]  The big news that this GDPR that the EU passed a few years ago that went into effect yesterday.
[52:46.000 --> 52:51.000]  Thousands of major websites, including the LA Times, you name it, are not even online in Europe.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  They're blocking people because it doesn't comply with the rules.
[52:54.000 --> 53:00.000]  And this is economic warfare.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  And whereas I am for privacy, this is nothing to do with privacy.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  This is all about EU control the Internet.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  And they're working with Communist China.
[53:06.000 --> 53:18.000]  And again, I'm going to tell you, China is not involved in the EU's claiming if your company stream over the Internet into our countries or are visible here, we claim jurisdiction over you.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  And we are going to sue you in the U.S. and find you in Europe.
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  And our regulators are saying they're going to roll over and go with that because they're liberals.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  They're globalists.
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  They're Obama people that were put in and Hillary people.
[53:29.000 --> 53:43.000]  So we're going under EU Internet control to shut us down and China is exempt.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  I'm not defending Google and Facebook.
[53:45.000 --> 53:50.000]  The point is, is this is all part of the attempt to take down of America.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  And these globalists all bet on the wrong team.
[53:53.000 --> 54:05.000]  And now we are facing as Americans, the Communist Chinese, the socialist EU, unelected, 1.8 million Muslims, Hollywood, and all the brainwashed leftist and people in this country.
[54:05.000 --> 54:11.000]  By the way, we have a special surprise guest instituted today that believe me, you don't want to miss.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  We're very excited about this.
[54:15.000 --> 54:21.000]  And believe me, this individual was one of the biggest news stories this week.

[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  In fact, is he here yet?
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  He's here.
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  Wow.

[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  He's going to be with us in studio today.

[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  It's apples and oranges for your body.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  I will tell you though we're coming out with something in a couple months that we're going to put a warning on the label.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  Even though it's all generally seen as safe and everything.
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  It is double the serving size of anything anyone's ever come up with.
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.000]  And it is it's turbo force.
[57:45.000 --> 58:14.000]  We'll be back. Stay with us.

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  That's just so ridiculous.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Michael Rotondo's mom and dad are so fed up they're suing to get him out of the house.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  I don't see why the judge wants to talk to people on the street.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  His parents filed the extraordinary lawsuit following months of repeated attempts to get him to leave their home in Syracuse, New York.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  And the story is getting lots of attention.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  A judge asked why he didn't just move in with his girlfriend and the man said girlfriend I'm a 30 year old man living at home.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  Dude there's no girlfriend.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  I just think it's the first empty nest by eviction.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  We are men who still live at home.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  It's reminding many of a real life failure to launch.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  The 2006 movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Bradley Cooper.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  This is going to take a stick of dynamite to get me out of my parents house.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  30 year old Michael Rotondo says he has no money.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  He's actually a dad himself but he lost custody and visitation rights.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  His parents say he's a freeloader who never offered to pay rent or do chores.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  He's apparently so thrifty he filled his water bottle with the court's pitcher.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  Christina and Mark Rotondo serve their son five official notices.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  Okay he is in the building ladies and gentlemen and you know the leftist media is attacking this guy.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  But at the same time the conservative media is but wait they're the ones that want us to be dependent.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  They're the ones in San Francisco everywhere that say we should just absolutely pay for bums.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  San Francisco is paid for thousands of homeless people to have sex changes.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Look it up. So I don't want to hear it.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  I already got to pay for abortions for people in Travis County whether you're for abortion or against it.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  Taxpayers shouldn't be paying for it.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  I got to pay for sex changes. I'm sick of it.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Let me tell you something. You want to chop your junk off. That's your business. I'm a libertarian.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Don't make me pay for it just like if you want a nose job or you want a facelift.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  It's the same thing. I'm not paying for it.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  It's incredible. But the left will pay for sex changes of six-year-old kids in England.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  But they won't pay for a little four-year-old girl who has a leg that's four inches too short.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  It's a $5,000 surgery here in the U.S. to go in and have the bone fused in.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  But they just told her we're going to cut your leg off cupcake.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  See, it's all about the leftist and their weird, sick social engineering having full control.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  Oh, we're not going to give you cataract surgery. Here's your cane.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Oh, they got more doctors than anybody per capita in the world in places like Cuba and Venezuela.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  But there's no machines or medicine and got a broken leg, cane.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  Got a bad knee, cane. Going blind, cane.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  Stand up and speak out. They beat you over the head with a cane.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  That doesn't do it. They take you out in the fields, fire and squad shoot you.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  And every little liberal trendy in Bernie Sanders loves it because they don't know who it's like.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  Boy, people, that is. You know what you'd be poor.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Yeah, I got $3 million worth of houses. I got, I like Audi A8, $120,000.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  My wife needs one. I need one. But capitalism, you know, when I go, this is a real quote,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  to the grocery store. There's 35 types of the odorant.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  You don't need all that. You don't, you just need an Audi A8.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  No big deal. $120,000.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  Venezuela is a really good place, though.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  When we return, Mark Rondazo, one of the top free speech lawyers in the country.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  I've talked to my lawyer. He said, oh, that guy's awesome.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  We're going to get him on the team.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  We're talking about doing that as liberal friends of my crucifix, though.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  There's so much going on. There's the new Sandy Hook lawsuits against me.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  We're going to get into all that. We're going to talk about all of it.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  When we return in T-minus 60 seconds and then the countdown begins until we have the 30-year-old kid in here.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  That's why InfoWarsLife has created a powerful new addition to the super blue line,
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  super blue silver immune gargle.

[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Well, Mark Rendazzo, one of the top free speech first-minute lawyers in the country,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  he's popping in for the next two segments with us, Rendazzo.com.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  He's got Rendazzo legal in a whole bunch of states,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  including Connecticut, where we just got sued by more of the Sandy Hook parents and an FBI agent.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  And my lawyers, and I even had some other lawyers look at it like Mr. Rendazzo looked at it and said,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  this is the next level of a frivolous lawsuit.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  I mean, they've got stuff out of context.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  It was in Statue of Limitations, so it's not even admissible and it's not even accurate.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  And I don't even know who this FBI agent is.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  It's just a way to run this all through the media,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  but I wanted to get his take on that a little bit.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  But also on just the attacks and free speech in general on conservatives, libertarians online and where he thinks that's going.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  And then I want to tie it into Morgan Friedman.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  You've got eight women and then you've got eight other witnesses or 16 total.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  So I guess that is eight other witnesses that he would tell women, you're really hot.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  I want to go out with you, man, you're sexy.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  And the women on TV will kind of giggle about it and then he would stop.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  Is it a creepy old man?
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Yeah, I mean, he's acting like I acted when I was about 18.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  But, you know, that's how you quite frankly in this world, I mean, if you want to get game as quickly as possible,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  you may have to run through a bunch of women, but you're going to run into the women that are ready to go.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  And James Kahn, one of my favorite actors from Rollerball, you name it.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  Of course, great job in the Godfather.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  He was asked about Friedman, which is no comparison to Weinstein, who always witnesses to him raping women.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  And then you've got Friedman and they're conflating the two like hitting on women is now sexual assault.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  And then the same is raping him in the back of your limousine.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Reportedly hundreds of women.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  I mean, he poorly did this all the time.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  So let's go ahead and just play that James Kahn clip.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  And then we're going to go to our guest, Mr. Rondaza.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  Here it is.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  Any thoughts on Morgan Freeman being accused of sexual assault?
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  You know how much of Morgan is a good guy.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Yeah.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  What do you think about him losing endorsements just over allegations like already without.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  He's already losing endorsements over the allegations that just came out.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  I know.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  We're becoming a very strange place.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  Yeah, Morgan's a great guy.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  You know, I mean, that's I think that's why God made men and women so they could be attracted to each other.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  Thank you.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  Well, actually, there's an attack on men and women.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  There's an attack on regular biology.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  This is the deep state.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  It's in the wiki.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  At least trying to make this all fight with each other and smoke screen.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  In my view, the real sexual abuse going on by elites in this country, but that's another issue that ties into speech.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  My right to tell a woman, I think you're gorgeous on the street or at a ticket counter or whatever.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  She says buzz off, pal.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  And I don't buzz off.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  You know, then there can be an issue.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  But men don't even do that now.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  Men are like all this in the West and scared of women.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  Mark, I mean, it's another subject, but it does deal with speech.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  What's your take on that as we see Harvey Weinstein doing the perp walk?
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  Look, you know, there's certainly are legitimate sexual harassment and sexual abuse cases.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  And if somebody has, is an employer and has quid pro quo sexual harassment over an employee, that's wrong.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  You know, what Bill Cosby did, my God, I mean, I don't even, I don't even get it.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  I mean, a celebrity can walk into any bar and say, you know, say to five different women, do you want to go home with me?
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  One of them is going to go home with him just because he's a celebrity, drugging somebody.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  I hope the guy dies in prison.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  But, you know, now it's, it's like this incremental movement.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  It can't ever be we've stopped what's bad and we're happy.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Now it has to go to even the guy hits on a woman.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  I mean, come on.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Look, my advice to all, all men out there, play the numbers, you know, let, I mean, let, let her decide she doesn't want to sleep with you.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Don't you decide it?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Ask everybody.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  Why not?
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  I don't see a problem with that.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  But, you know, there has to be this constant drumbeat to beat down any semblance of masculinity in our culture.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  You know, frankly, because, you know, I don't know why, but there's this, this mental illness that seems to be going through us as a society that we want to completely
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  purge any gender differences in any kind of, you know, man, it's like the fun patrol showing up in a Jeep every single time.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  Well, exactly.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  Morgan Freeman is not accused of anything that I wouldn't be completely proud to do myself, at least from what I've seen in this segment so far.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Absolutely.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  I mean, I mean, he's a little pushy.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  Some of it to me is creepy, but it's a free country and the women, though, act like they like it.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  They giggle, they play with their hair, they wiggle around in the chair.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  And then that's when he starts getting a little bit more aggressive.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  So in a way, it's not creepy because they act like they like it.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Yeah, look, I wasn't there, but from what I've seen here, the only thing I've seen is that the guy was flirting with women, which I think is.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  Well, that's the allegation, too.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  They're just saying that he was aggressively flirting with him.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  And again, how is that as big a story as Weinstein, which if this is true, and I think there's so many people saying it and a lot of evidence to it, then I think the guy should, you know, be sent to prison for life.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  Yeah, I mean, again, just when men abuse their position, when men use either abuse their position of authority or do something forceful or drug a woman.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  My God, I want to be the, you know, I'll be the first one out there with a pitchfork in a torch.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  But it's it's this, you know, you've got this loud contingent of a very small group of people who really, you know, I think, I think it comes from mental illness from women who just don't like their dads.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  You know, they just have this paradigm in their head that they think that every guy is somehow evil and they've got to beat this out of society, that there can be absolutely no masculinity at all.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  And it's ultimately going to create, I think, a crisis if it hasn't already.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  I mean, we got to be worried about this.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Well, there's a thing also with liberal Democrat Party women with other Republicans that I know that they like these hotels downtown in Austin.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  So I'm married, I'm not involved in any of this, but I hear about people.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  The Democrat women want alpha males that will actually go and treat them bad and actually say horrible things to them.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  And I'm like, I wouldn't even do that if they wanted you to.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  But that's the whole point is there's the other six side of this, that a lot of these women say that all masculinity is bad.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  But in truth, they're really looking for somebody to treat them bad.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  You've got 50 shades of gray and more and more women into all this bondage stuff.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  So like you said, it really just sounds like insanity to me.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  And I think it distracts from real bad things that are happening to women to conflate hitting on a girl with raping.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Yeah, I mean, look, that is the problem, that there is this argument that it's a continuum from flirting to rape.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  And no, rape and sexual assault is an act of violence, you know, flirting.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  Hell, that's the first step in the reproductive process.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  You know, are you interested?
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  You know, as far as the, you know, these women at the hotels that want to be mistreated, I don't know.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  And I think that's a dangerous way for guys to look at it.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  I mean, I can certainly say that I've bumped into that.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  Not my thing.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Not my thing either.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  But that's what I'm saying is that's growing and it's generally with women that claim they're liberal and hate all men.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  It's like well known that interracial porn outsells three to one, four to one in the deep South to white males.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  I didn't know that.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  But yeah, that's a statistic.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  But it's the same thing that liberal will like take take take women on women relationships and the amount of abuse that goes on there.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  I mean, these are real statistics.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  They don't want to discuss.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  I don't know what they mean.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  I don't know.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  Well, I know what they mean.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  And that is that look, it's everything is about power and domination.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  Everything.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  So imagine if you could walk into a room and everybody's supposed to play a certain game.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  But all you have to do is, you know, pull one card and you're automatically at a disadvantage.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  You know, this is a good way to target anyone and everyone who you might want to eliminate or climb on top of.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  It's it's the it's the victim Olympics.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Let me ask you where you're going to break it and come back with the First Amendment.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  When do you think we get the bottom of this? When does when do we get peak political correctness?
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  One day in the future, there will be the Uber victim.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  It will be one victim to rule over all of them.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  You know, there will be a black lesbian in a wheelchair with an eye patch and every single possible victimization and she will rule.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  So it ends with.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  It's dystopian.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Look, it's a dystopian fairy tale, but you know, it's it really is like this, this race to see who can be strong through victimization.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  That's right.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  It's a race to make everybody be weak and lazy and stupid so they can be controlled.

[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  The Information War
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  Okay, I got sidetracked over into the Harvey Weinstein situation.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  And from what I've heard people that know him and he is a monstrous pig.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  I said that he reportedly raped women first.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  I was attacked by major publications on the left like The Huffington Post saying,
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  Jones made outrageous claims.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  He said there's a cult too where they brand women and torture them.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  I didn't want to say the name and get sued. I knew about nexium from people that had been on the periphery of it.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  But yeah, it's a lot bigger than that.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  And I heard Obama and Richard Branson were involved and I said that.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  And now it's in the news.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  But I'm going to stop right there.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  You've got the floor for the time we have.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  You're going to be back in the studio several hours with us.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  Mark Rondazza next Tuesday because I knew he was a top lawyer.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  But my lawyer is one of the technical guys.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  Some of their guys are some of the top people and they say he's just one of the best.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  So we're honored to have him here on the show.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  And he's a more classical liberal.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  He's just tuned in.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  Let's get into the latest Sandy Hook, more rounds of suits against me without giving away too much.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  What do you think of it?
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  You know, when I look at a complaint like this and I see that it's got what 394 paragraphs,
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  you know, that's not always an indication of something,
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  but it usually is in a case like this because it's relatively simple facts.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  If we look at the facts, they're saying you said something hurtful about them,
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  you said something untrue about them,
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  that shouldn't require 400 odd paragraphs to explain.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  And when I look at this complaint and I look at how the, you know,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  the logical contortions that some of it went through,
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  and I'm going to take at this point a judge,
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  if you file a motion to dismiss,
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  is going to take everything in this complaint as true,
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  just for the purpose of emotion to dismiss.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  Summary judgment or trial, that's later on when you evaluate the evidence.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  Let's look at this and just say every single thing in it is true from a factual perspective.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  It still seems like a pretty strange suit to me.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  It's trying to, you know, it's funny how when it accuses you of being a conspiracy theorist,
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  but then it creates this, it seems like an implausible conspiracy among you and these other people
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  who happen to just be some of your viewers.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  So, you know, if you want to bring just as a theme,
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  when you write a complaint, you write legal documents,
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  you got to remember you're talking to a human being.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  At the end of the day, a judge or the judge's clerks is going to read this.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  And if you create the theme of here's a conspiracy theory against this person
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  who were accusing of being a conspiracy theorist,
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  I think you lose a little rhetorical ground.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  Another thing I'm looking at in it that I find curious is they've added one defendant.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  So this case is filed in Connecticut.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  They've added one defendant who's in Connecticut.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  So we've got plaintiffs in Connecticut and defendants in Connecticut.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  And why that's important is when you have diversity of citizenship.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  So you have plaintiffs and defendants from different states
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  and they're seeking in excess of $75,000,
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  you have the right to remove your case to federal court.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  That's something that's been enshrined in the law forever.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  Now, when you put somebody who's a nominal defendant on another side of the case
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  so that you have defendant and plaintiffs in the same state, you lose that right.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  So the concern here, I think, is that they really don't want this to get into federal court.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  And there's a number of reasons for that.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  Federal court is perceived to be more defendant friendly.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  That's not to say that I am.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  Sure. I mean, let's just say it.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  They want it in local court.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  Sure. Yeah.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  I mean, Connecticut judges are appointed for eight years and then they can be reappointed.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  So if you have something that might be a politically challenging case,
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  you probably would prefer it to be in state court.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  I'm not saying that the judge here isn't going to make a completely above board decision.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  But the reason that we put into the law this ability to remove to federal court
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  is because there was a perception that people might get hometowned by state court judges.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  Meanwhile, a federal judge say what you want about lifetime tenure.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  There are problems with that.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  But one of the good things about lifetime tenure for a federal judge is they are completely insulated from politics.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  A federal judge can make whatever decision they want.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  Article three of the Constitution means the judge never has to say he's sorry.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  Sure. So on the time we have left, without giving away too much here about the defense here,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  I mean, I think the goal here is public relations to drive me through the mud,
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  to bring the shooting back up for political purposes,
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  not by the family, but by the Democrats and by the establishment doing this.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  And a lot of them admit that in the news, but that's their goal.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  And then to keep saying that I'm still saying when I never said the way they said I did those things,
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  they misrepresent it, they reboot it and then create the trauma.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  They say I created themselves by always bringing it back up
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  and then never saying all the apologies or all the clarifications over the years,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  they just reboot the crime against humanity they say I committed.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  Well, you know, there is something called the Streisand effect,
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  which means that there's no better way to bring a spotlight to statements that you don't want to hear than to sue over it.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  So yes, they've kicked the beach ball back up in the air here by suing.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  As far as what this is part and parcel of, I think, you know, I think we've, when you look at this,
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  you know, you do have allegations in the complaint of people who really have had their feelings hurt by one thing or another.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  You can't discount that. That doesn't mean that I think it's definitely actionable.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  You know, you have some problems in this complaint.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  Look, a lot of these statements are outside the statute of limitations.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  The statute of limitations in Connecticut for defamation is two years, three years for other.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  But it's further than that. We've gone and pulled some of the statements up.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  Some of them are not even accurate in their little snippet.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  But then right after it, I'm playing devil's advocate and saying, but I don't believe that.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  So this is the next level saying you can't even question or talk about what other people are questioning.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  It's like this other lawsuit against me here in Texas on this.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  I'm reading a zero hedge article or Owen Shroyer ish where they're questioning something that someone said on Megan Kelly's
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  Dateline NBC. It's a public program. She's saying these things.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  They say there's an anomaly there. We cover zero hedge in the anomaly.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  I say, no, I think kids died. I think he held his kids and then they say that is me doing it.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  It's next level in a complaint like this.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  I don't know if it's next level. It's a very common thing to be honest.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Throughout my career, I've seen defamation cases like this where somebody has either motivation to shut somebody up
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  or simply looking for money or actually feels genuinely wrong and is looking for the strongest legal theory possible.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  So in any event, it's always a plaintiff's attorney in a defamation cases.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  It's always their desire to cherry pick out the worst of the worst.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  And then it's the defense attorney's job to say, Hey, wait a minute.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  You got to look at what came before and after these quotes and put it all in.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  Here's the decision we have to make context always matters.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  Absolutely. We'll talk again in person on Tuesday here in studio.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  I'm Mark Rondaza. Thanks for spending time on this and 20 seconds left.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  The big question is, do we launch anti slapback provisions in Texas and Connecticut?
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  And I think you and I talking the answers. Yes.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  I would never forego the opportunity to bring a well-placed anti slap motion and Connecticut has a good anti slap law.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  So, you know, that that is something that I think should be considered.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  Yeah, I'm going to direct that on both. We'll talk soon. Thank you.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  Okay.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  We got a big guest coming in studio that fellow that was 30 got evicted from his parents' house.

[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  Thank you.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars life products.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  Absolutely.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.000]  understand that there's bigger problems going on. And if we can get our houses in order
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:15.000]  We are drugged out. We are following other people's opinions. We are controlled by the media.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  Today it all changes. This reality has been forced upon us. It is a choice.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  Just like what I said, slavery is a choice.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f**k you, f**k you.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Why don't we just try love? Why don't we just try love?
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers to change something.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Steve Jobs is crazy. Now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  They say drugs crazy. They say I'm crazy.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  But I'm here to show love. It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  Michael Rotondo, thanks for coming in studio with us.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  Thanks for having me.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  You bet. You have been one of the biggest stories in the United States and in other parts of the world this week.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  It's exciting. It's not what I was...
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  All I wanted was just to get what I asked for, what I believed justice to be.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  I didn't really want to have a turn into a media thing, but it's fine.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  I understand. But USA Today, there's the headline right there.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  30-year-old man, a victimized parent. I'm not a crazy person.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  You speak at the court. I don't think you're crazy.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  I think you're a little quirky, but everybody's a little quirky in ways.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  And it's easy to get you on here and be mean to you and say that you're a 30-year-old bum.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  Because the real bums, the people that are on welfare and make the public pay for their abortions and for their sex changes,
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  that's the level above it.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  Or here in Travis County where they, again, make the citizens pay for illegal aliens,
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  free healthcare and abortions and things like that, and illegal aliens out in California wanting free healthcare and anchor babies.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  And my whole issue is, we're told these are wonderful, perfect angels,
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  but then the very same liberal media piled on some of the conservative media
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  and called you a bum and a joke and a slob and a delusional idiot.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  And all these things, which if that's true, that makes all of us even bigger morons
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  to then at the same time, like 1984, hold it in our mind that all these other people are entitled to free stuff.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  I think that you shouldn't have people who need things like food and shelter in your own communities.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  I don't think it's something that you want.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  I'm just saying, just look at the red light, yeah.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Doing great.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Yeah, I don't think it's a good thing to have.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  But even if it costs more, even if it needs to raise taxes to get these people food and housing,
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I don't think it's something that you would wish to forego because then you have hungry people and crime's going to go up.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  Isn't that going to contribute to crime, don't you think?
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  That's one of the historically more reasonable arguments to that equation.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  So nobody wants that, nobody wants crime, no one wants to have to use a firearm and then have themselves get attacked by the liberal media from that
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  and then start the whole, take the guns away type of argument, which is not a problem.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  And you're calling yourself a conservative?
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  I have some very conservative views.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  I have a lot of very liberal views, but I think that the founding fathers had it right when they wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  I think that if we were following it, I think that both of the ideals of conservatives and liberals could be accommodated.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  Well, Michael, here's the bottom line.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  I can't go on a high horse and say you're the worst person when it comes to the whole welfare society out there when on a scale of one to ten, you're about a three or a four,
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  because one of the most natural ways for people to turn into dependents and to go down this road you're on is with their parents.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  And in a lot of cultures, you know, that happens.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  Our families live in big houses together, but they all go out and work in the fields together or work in the factories and it's more of a communal, you know, situation like the Waltons or something.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  So on the other side of the equation, though, what about your parents?
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  If you don't have a job, what about them?
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  They become your slave.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  If they've got to pay for the food, the electricity, the house, the transportation, I would guess the medicine.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  I mean, what about them?
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  What are you going to do?
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  A, that's one question.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  B, what are you going to do when your parents can no longer pay for anything?
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  What are you going to do when they have to go to the nursing home or God forbid, you know, have a stroke or heart attack or die?
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  I've been trying to leave the home for years and it's as a result of that, that I felt as though I would be able to in about three months from now, which was the case.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  Well, the case I made was for six months because that was what.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  So you agree it's a form of slavery to make them take care of you?
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  To make, yeah, I don't want to make them take care of me.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  But, but they've been trying to get you out for six years.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  No.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Where is that coming from?
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  I saw that on the news.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Is that not right?
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  That's not right.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  Where do you have that handy?
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  On the news said that you lost your job eight years ago, six years ago that they've been trying to get out for years.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  Is that not true?
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  That's they know first part is true.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  Second part falls.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  Right.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  So I've been there for eight years and but they've only tried to get me out.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  Sure.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  And they've been sober of this past year and they had made the my first hearing of their decision for me to leave was the February 2nd notice.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Sure.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  Well, I did think the media made this all one dimensional to make fun of you and the laugh at you.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  And I also said some, you know, you know, drug toward things that I've said into your face here, just being honest with you, because I want to have a man to man talk with you on air and off air.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  To offer you a job.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  Okay.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  As a reporter.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  Okay.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  And even get you a crew.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  Okay.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  In, in New York, but you'd act to actually go out and do the shoots and do the reports, you know, Howard Stern hired interesting people.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  And I, and I think you call yourself a conservative.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  I think you, I think we could, I'll just say it, we could turn you into a formidable individual.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  But we're gonna have to have some discussions.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  All right.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  But now, now that's New York City or New York State.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  But, but so you may have to go where we want you to go.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  That's part of having to take care of yourself.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Well, you have to make compromises with your employers or other people.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  I just want to be able to see my son.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  I understand.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  Right.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  So sure, we could probably, that's how the discussion happens.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  But regardless, I've got to check here for you when we come back for coming down here.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  And I want to try to just explain a few things to you, which you sound like a smart guy in certain aspects.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  It is slavery if you parents are to take care of you.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  Someday they won't be able to take care of you.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  You're going to be more empowered in your life if you go out through a daily process and go through trials and tribulations.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  You know, if they try to grow plants and zero gravity, they don't manage is what you're saying.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  Well, but I mean, plants don't grow well in zero gravity.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  That's right.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  You understand on a Mars mission, on a one year Mars mission just to get there, you would have trouble walking even if you were in really great shape once you got there.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  I'm no, I would not characterize myself as a plant.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  But no, I'm explaining something to you.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  All right.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  If you don't go out and work and live your life and go through stress, you don't become strong.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  That's right.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  You get pulled apart and you become sedentary and have Alzheimer's types effects by even age 30.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  Right.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  Okay.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  And I've run into the kids that play with phones and TVs all day.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  They have that same look in their eye that you do.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  There's an intelligence there, but you are in a kind of a mesmerized trance state.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  You don't have a drive state going.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  My heads in the clouds is what you're saying.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  Your heads in the clouds.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  Okay.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  And you're smart, but you're not completely productive conscious.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  Okay.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  And it's beyond the laziness.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  It's a spirit.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  It's a program.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  How much TV and video games do you play and watch?
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  Very little.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  I don't do any video games.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  I've been in video games long time ago.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  The television.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  I try to watch television because I need to stop.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  I need to have some time where I stop working so that I can sleep.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  I need to have some...
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  When are you working?
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  I work all day, every day almost.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  A what?
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  Law.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  I have a business.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  You have a business?
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  You have a business.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  Well, then why don't you move out of your parent's house?
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  I'm going to move out.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  I expect to be able to...
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  Let me ask you a question when we come back.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  All right.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  I got key questions for you when we come back.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  Okay.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  We're going to discuss this straight ahead.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  We have him here.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  The 30-year-old evicted, about to be evicted.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  I want to find out if you've actually left yet.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  He has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  Brainwash young people against infowars.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  We will prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com, newswars.com.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  I'm so excited, the new product, infowars.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  It is amazing.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  Red pill, now available at infowars.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in Fuller's life.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  It'd take hours.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  It's back in stock.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  It's got the preglinone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body, and it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  So you can upload it, and our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine 4-5 toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  That's a spray you do.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  You can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  So thank you all for remembering infowars.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  It's so essential to spread the word.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  And again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  Michael Rotondo, one of the biggest stories in the country.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  30-year-old taking his parents to court because they're trying to kick him out of the house and he wants more time.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  We're going to find out if he's actually out now.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  I guess it was like two days ago, the judge ruled this.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  He's here with us in Austin, Texas, in studio.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  And look, this is how capitalism works, my friend.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  I said, I will pay you $1,000 just to come on, just so you get a little bit of money and hopefully learn how to make your own money and go out and be free and have your own wife, your own life.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  I know you've been married before.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  I've been married before.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  Or have a child.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  Right.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  The point is, is that here's $3,000, my friend, so that you can hopefully get on your own feet.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  I can, and this means a lot to me.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  And you're keeping me off the street with this.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Well, listen.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  I appreciate it.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  I can't sit here and, you know, just, just, just put you down and call you names.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  And I've said a few smart mouth things.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  But again, what I'm getting in here is the globalists, the social engineers, they want to make us all dependent.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  They've set up a culture and a system that is trying to arrest our development.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  And it is electronically programming our brains to put us into a type of artificial Asperger's type state, but not an Asperger's state where people are even able to carry out tasks.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  It's a spectrum and it's electromagnetic and it's mainstream news now that this is happening.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  And our embassy staff are getting hit with it at, you know, amped up rates.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  The cell phone radiation is causing heart problems, brain damage, doubling brain tumors, just with the old three and four G.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  And so what I'm telling you is I can't sit here and judge you wanting to be with your parents, having some type of psychological, you know, baby thing where you don't want to leave.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  I can't analyze the whole deal, but I'm telling you, this won't go well for you down the road.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  If you continue to not make yourself go out and live on your own and reach out.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  Just the idea of doing everything kind of OCD, you know, in exact little ways, the way you want to get it done.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  And then people catering to that is going to put you into a smaller and smaller box in my view.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  I'm not a psychiatrist and psychologist. I'm just a student of the street and live.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  I'm not going to actually humanize you, but also tell you, I think your parents are doing the right thing, giving you a swift kick in the old ass.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  That would be reasonable. I think I would say that maybe they should have served me a six month notice to quit and then I'd be out in six months and they wouldn't have had to pay a penny in legal fees.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  And I'd be out just as you had represented that you thought was a good idea.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  And some of the liberal professors and people saying, oh, you have a right to stay.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  Well, then do I have a right to just go knock on somebody's door and say they're going to take care of me?
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  This idea, take care of me, take care of me. You know what happens at the park?
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  If you feed the squirrels and you feed the wildlife, they become obese, greedy, hateful and stupid.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  And that's what they say. They don't feed the animals at the park.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  So that opinion may come from the February 2nd notice was a threat to basically commit a crime according to the real property law of New York State where you cannot all of a sudden lock someone out without a court proceeding.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  So that may be taken from that where it's believed that, you know, you go to the court, I would say what I said to the judge, which is that, you know, this was this notice is against the law and they were threatening to commit a crime and it was harassment.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  And the judge could respond to that by penalizing my parents and saying, listen, you know,
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  But they left you five notices and even offered cash to help you get your new home.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  Right. But that doesn't change the fact that it requires about six months to make it so you can support.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  But listen, bottom line, do parents, when their child is, I think biologically twice the age pass when they should be out of the house,
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  they keep arresting development more and more and more. I mean, you know, like you read wagon wheels, which is based on the true story. You know, it's like former slave family and they got their little seven, eight, nine year olds marching 100 miles with a map that daddy drew to say, meet me there.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  They made it there. I already talked about my frontier families and stuff. It was the same kind of stuff.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  I mean, you have people skinning bucks running trot lines, but they were 10 years old and now look at us. They're saying the new 18 is 35.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  I'm sure you've seen those headlines where there's this whole culture. Austin is filled with people like you. Really? Yeah, but they just live off welfare.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  They work one day a week. It's their religion. But then they think I've got to pay more taxes so that they can, you know, sit around a smoke dope all day.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  Well, one thing I have to say in response to that is that I think that it's important that people are trying to, you know, to grow themselves.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  And it sounds like these people you're describing are not trying to do that. And from that, there would be more opportunity because there'd be more businesses.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  So I, you know, I talked about what you were saying before about how people are sort of brought into this sedentary lifestyle where they just, you know, and I'm saying you're really common.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  You're not this, this. I'm not that. Well, I'm saying what we're discussing here is super garden variety. It's the trend.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  It's not the exception. It's the trend. It's growing. And most people that are like this act just like you.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  They're usually witty in ways. They're smart. They have little comebacks. They have all the little ways of doing things. And I think it's a gross form of selfishness.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  You're calling me a millennial?
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  Well, you are.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  All right. I am a millennial. I will admit that. But what is it with millennials?
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  I mean, I'm not bragging, bro. But when I was 11, I was, I'm not going to even get into it all. The point is, I'll tell both ways.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  Well, by the time I was 12, I was all intensive purposes had done the things men do. Okay.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  But in a bunch of fights already been with women, whole nine yards, look like I was 16. I was 16, look like I was 20 something.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  I was 21 already on the radio 22 syndicated. I'm 44 now. I'm not saying that grade of a person.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  My dad was going in an apprenticeship said factories and stuff when he was 10. His, his, his, his great uncle went, ran away from home when he was 11 and jumped on a steamboat and went to China and all around the world and came back.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  And then was the, you know, one of the biggest, you know, runners of liquor in Houston.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  Would he have done that?
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  I mean, take Shane Stoner, my buddy's great grandfather who died at like 102 bucks time. He, he ran the Dixie mafia in Texas. The whole nine yards by the time he was like, by the time he was like 30 years old.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  All right.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  But I'm just saying, man, how do people become like this? How do you not want to go out and do something?
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  What is that? Your, your uncle hit the hop on the train and went off that way.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  My dad's great uncle.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  Your dad's great.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  I'm saying they were all like that.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  Right. Cause they felt they're like 11 years old in the middle of the countryside in these Texas. I'm gone.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  They were raised to be capable.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  Yeah.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  Not like today.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  Okay. So how were you raised?
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  Uh, I wouldn't really characterize myself as having been raised necessarily. It was more, it was more or less, I had to, you know, fend for myself in a lot of ways in that, in that environment where
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  Sin for yourself and your parents' house. I mean, did your parents abuse you?
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  Well, they, well, I would, uh, I'm not responding to that right now, but, um, I would say that, uh, I had to figure out things for myself.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  If I wanted to achieve something, I had to figure out how I was or was not going.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  Were you a latchkey kid?
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  I don't know what that means.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  Did your parents let like leave you at home all day by yourself?
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  I was on my own, uh, most of the day.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  Let me ask you this question real quick, cause we appreciate you being here.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  Sure.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  Um, how, how are you doing right now? Are you still at home with your parents?
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  Yeah.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  Tell us about that.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  Uh, it's, it's weird. Um, there was, uh, there's only two instances. It's been, it was basically normal.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  And then, but people have been asking me questions and I realized it's a little different.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  My, my father, uh, the day of the judgment, the day the judgment, uh, came down.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  I was in the house. I was in the kitchen at the same time as they were.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  And my father and I tried to occupy the same pace, uh, the same space at the same time.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  And I said, excuse me, cause I was just being, you know, reasonable person, just, you know, um, and he said, no, Michael will not excuse you.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  And I, I just, I didn't say anything. And I, I, I, I think to myself, you know, what was he trying to achieve with that?
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  What was that for? And, um, from that, I, uh, that, that, that was new.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  It was new for there to be a sort of a, a line in the sand all of a sudden.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  Wow. So your parents got a little cold with you.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  I would say, I would say provocative of a confrontation.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  Well, when you start getting old, you really want to do things the way you want to do them.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  And it would be, if I was 60 something years old, how old are your parents?
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  60 something years old, 61.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  I mean, and I had a son going around that was dressed like cousin.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  I get pissed off and tell him, get the hell out of the house.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  I can't wait to get out of there.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  And by the way, I like your beard and hair. I was just doing a cheap shot there.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  I look like a pumpkin head. So it's, it's all right.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  You look great.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  No, I don't.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  Anyway, my wife says I do. I don't think so. Hey, hey, but seriously, seriously.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  When are you going to get out now?
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  I, um, I'm considering that I can have, well, it depends on how many hands I have to help me
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  because I've had some people offer to help me, but it's basically getting my stuff to, uh,
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  Well, you just got $3,000.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  I got, yeah, I got the things out of there and put them in another, another place and then
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  but the $3,000, you can't have that much stuff.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  We're talking, you know, 300, 400 bucks, a moving company.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do it myself.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  I'm going to save. I have until, uh,
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  everyone is an operating on your time table, bro.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  I have until January 1st. You're telling me I got to get up sooner.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  Or, uh, June, June 1st.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  June 1st.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  Yeah.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  I'm going to just try to put your email out or something.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  The listeners want to help you.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  I mean, help you move your stuff.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Don't put my email out there.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  There might be a girl out there that thinks you're pretty handsome.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  That's not going to help me.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  Don't you want to have one of those weightluster ones?
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  There's one of those really strong girls that can, you know,

[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  I need your support.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.940]  four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:57.980]  Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:02.860]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:04.380]  It's made in the USA.

[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:17.900]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:22.540]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:23.540]  get.

[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:39.740]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:14.580]  Well I think Michael Rotondo is eccentric, that was the old word they had for smart people
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:16.780]  that are quirky and a little weird.
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:20.180]  And of course I've now been talking to him during the breaks and he told me about his
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:27.060]  interest and I have to tell you my friends it is Ashberger's type spectrum classic things.
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:31.300]  You tell me you like machines, you like numbers, you like engineering, you like just to watch
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:35.180]  machines for hours on YouTube every day and that's fine, that's actually I think a form
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:38.620]  of advanced intelligence but if people don't know how to shuttle you into the thing you
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:41.260]  need to be doing then you'll just kind of spin your wheels forever.
[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:45.060]  Because there are some people that are virtuosos with music, some people are virtuosos with
[02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:48.620]  physical prowess, some people are virtuosos when it comes to oratory, some people are
[02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:51.860]  virtuosos when it comes to being psychic, you understand?
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:55.580]  But then there's other people that are just, their brains kind of get caught in the little
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:59.740]  technical minutiae events, which is fine, there's jobs for that and there's fulfillment
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:00.740]  for that.
[02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:07.700]  So you're saying I'm an employable person is what you're saying?
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:09.420]  Repeat what you told me earlier, what you like to do.
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:17.140]  I like to go on YouTube, I like to watch machinery, I like to watch what I'm watching, what the
[02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:25.100]  engineers have designed and engineered and built to be efficient and functional and
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:26.100]  productive.
[02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:31.060]  Okay, then have you gone out and gotten the models and things and then built your own
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:32.580]  things or modified them?
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.940]  I've done some things like that.
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:42.420]  Okay, well why don't you then go to like a radio, television, electronics type schools,
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:45.820]  they have those, a lot of those places actually can get you really good jobs.
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:48.540]  I mean a bunch of people like you.
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:51.380]  That's too monotonous, I like working with people.
[02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:55.500]  Well no, they're going to be people involved, that's the whole point.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:02:02.580]  I don't think, I don't think I could do engineering in an office all day.
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:04.100]  I could do design.
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:09.140]  Hey, Pete Zaria-Shane offers job a 30-year-old New York man evicted by parents.
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:13.180]  Can you send me that link because I had someone refer me to that today, they haven't connected
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:14.180]  me to it.
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:20.260]  So you'd rather, that's nice for them off for your job because, but at the same time,
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:31.380]  you don't want a job as somebody doing technical work without the degree in engineering?
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:32.380]  Probably not.
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:33.380]  It depends.
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:36.860]  I mean I really, it depends what your, what exactly the job description is.
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:38.540]  I mean there's engineers, there's people who design.
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:40.060]  Do you have any friends?
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:41.060]  Sort of.
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.860]  Not close friends, I don't really have any close friends.
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:47.180]  You have to get out though.
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:48.180]  Of house.
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:50.540]  You just, you need to go out and get out of the house.
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:51.540]  Yes.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:52.540]  I need to socialize.
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:53.540]  Yes.
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:56.300]  Your parents are trying, see there's always been people like you.
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:57.300]  You're a good guy.
[02:02:57.300 --> 02:02:58.300]  All right.
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:02:59.500]  There's all different types of people.
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:04.060]  The internet and computers are allowing people to plug into this virtual reality and every
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:07.660]  metric and every statistic says it's destroying people.
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:11.220]  Netflix is making the population growth rate go down.
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.300]  People aren't having sex because of Netflix.
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:15.300]  You know, humanity is dying.
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:16.780]  Our IQs are lowering.
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:20.340]  If you're in a mesmerized state, you need to come out of it.
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:21.340]  Come on.
[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:22.900]  Michael, you can do it.
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:23.900]  Come on.
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:24.900]  You can do it.
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:25.900]  You understand.
[02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:27.980]  You don't have to be in this other place.
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:28.980]  You can be here now.
[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:32.540]  It's an entire universe right there waiting for you.
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:36.780]  Have you ever run around in the mountains at night with a full moon?
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:40.580]  It's about 30 degrees out, your shirt off.
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:42.580]  I've done, I've done some things like that.
[02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:43.580]  Stuff like that.
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:45.140]  That's how you wake up and recharge.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:48.860]  You need to not just be hiding in your house.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:53.020]  You've run around on mountaintops at night with a full moon with your shirt off, 30 degrees.
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:54.020]  Not exactly that.
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.020]  Okay.
[02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:56.460]  That's what I do for entertainment.
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:00.900]  But the point is, is that you need to do things like that.
[02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:06.020]  I need to run around like a lunatic.
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:07.020]  Yes.
[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:10.420]  I don't know if that's going to help my case.
[02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:12.700]  But you know, it is lunatic, lunacy.
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:13.700]  Really?
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.820]  I'm going to say, you've been programmed by the modern system.
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:17.780]  You need the real lunacy.
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:23.340]  See, I'm crazy, so I can't go nuts.
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:24.340]  I got you.
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:25.340]  You need to go.
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:26.340]  I'm serious.
[02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:30.900]  You need to break out of those little norms, those little areas, those little back eddies
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:35.660]  that you're in, and you need to come out of it.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.380]  I think that's happening.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:39.380]  I think it is.
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:42.580]  That ridiculous thought of me.
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:50.540]  Oh boy, infowars.com, newswars.com, Michael Rotondo is here, and he's got $3,000 in a

[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:43.580]  A judge asked why he didn't just move in with his girlfriend, and the man said,
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:07:05.780]  I'm a 30-year-old man living at home, dude, there's no girlfriend.
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:15.740]  Well, he needs you in case something happened to the mom or whatever to be self-sufficient,
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:25.620]  so that you can take care of him until he's 18.
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:34.180]  But what if something never suits you?
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:37.540]  Donald Trump had some pretty wives before.
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:42.700]  Melania, though, was a whole other universe, but he hadn't run into Melania yet.
[02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:47.780]  Melania wasn't born yet when Trump got his first wife.
[02:07:47.780 --> 02:08:06.460]  You'll see, you have to get while the getting's good, son.
[02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:11.380]  Look at the smile on Shroyer, bring him up right now, can we punch that up?
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:14.020]  Shroyer, that's a guy afraid to get out and do anything.
[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:18.580]  Oh, and I don't want to be mean to this guy, but the media acts like he's so rare and
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:22.740]  everybody looks down their nose at it, this guy is the future right here on the course
[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:23.740]  we are.
[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:26.980]  And I'm trying to get money, trying to get him a job, I'm like, hey, you want to be
[02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:27.980]  a reporter for us?
[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:28.980]  I'm serious.
[02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:32.380]  And if you just do some basic stuff and get better and better, you can be really successful
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:35.940]  with us, but you've got to go out and do it.
[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:40.860]  It sounds like I could do a lot of good with that.
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:44.820]  Do what must be done, Lord Vader, show no mercy.
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:47.500]  I'm not a Star Wars fan.
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:51.580]  I'm not, I'm a Palpatine fan.
[02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:53.740]  You didn't know I'm Palpatine's my spirit animal?
[02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:56.780]  No, they overlooked that when they were mucking me up.
[02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:59.140]  I'm Palpatine is my co-pilot.
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:00.140]  Okay.
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:01.940]  I don't know what that is.
[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:02.940]  I'm Palpatine's my boyfriend.
[02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:04.940]  I thought you had a wife.
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:07.740]  I said my spirit out, it's a joke.
[02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.740]  Okay.
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:15.100]  It's a joke, Ian McDermott, okay, the actor, he's hilarious.
[02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:17.740]  Emperor Palpatine is a comic genius.
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:18.740]  You know that.
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:22.100]  Owen Troyer, you want to say something to this great American, you've got a big veteran
[02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:23.100]  show coming up today.
[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:26.300]  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that and we're going to be talking about that here in just
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:30.220]  a minute in studio, but I actually had a couple of questions for Michael, you know, we're
[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:33.420]  about the same age, so I figured I had, I could ask him a couple of questions.
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:34.420]  How old are you, Owen?
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:35.420]  I'm 28.
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:39.220]  You've got your degree in psychology, you're a Jedi Sith Lord.
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:44.060]  I just want to know because one of my, I mean, when I was younger, one of my biggest causes
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:48.220]  to want to get out of the house was so that, you know, I could have like a girl over.
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:51.580]  So I'm just curious, how do you, do you, do you even try to attempt to get women in
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:52.580]  the house?
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:53.580]  I was thrown out of the house.
[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:54.580]  How do you get women into the parents' house?
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:57.700]  I was thrown out of the house because my mom did not like this old girlfriend and when
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:02.180]  that girlfriend, old Cindy, smart mouthed my mom in the kitchen, my mom had me thrown
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:03.300]  out in two days.
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:05.820]  She said, David, get him out of here.
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:08.780]  So I can kind of think her from being a smart mouth, my mom, I might still be there, huh?
[02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:10.660]  Sorry, sorry, Owen, ask your question again.
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:13.300]  I remember what it was, it'd be nice to see him if you want, though.
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:17.420]  No, so I'm just curious, I mean, do you, do you even attempt to meet women anymore or
[02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:18.420]  have you given up on that yet?
[02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:19.420]  Do you bring women in the house?
[02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:21.580]  No, I don't bring anyone in the house.
[02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:22.580]  Okay.
[02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:26.900]  Is it time, I don't have time to freshen up with women really.
[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:30.900]  Okay, so, but you know what, you said that earlier, you also said that you are, do you
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:32.020]  have a law degree?
[02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:33.020]  No.
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.580]  So what, you said you do legal work.
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:35.580]  So what legal work?
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:37.220]  Well, Owen, Owen, you've got a degree in psychology.
[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:40.460]  Does this guy not act like he's got Asperger's with a helping of laziness?
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:41.940]  Well, I'm not a doctor.
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:43.780]  I understand what you've got to do.
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:46.940]  But I don't, I mean, I don't, I don't know, it's a nature versus a nurture argument.
[02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:51.660]  Then it doesn't seem like it's the nurture, so maybe it's a vaccine or the food or something.
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:52.660]  I don't know.
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:56.660]  What if you had to, if you had to pick one, if you had to say Asperger's or no, what would
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:57.660]  you pick?
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:00.460]  Well, I think your Asperger spectrum undoubtedly is by all of it, but then you've got the
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:04.820]  overlay of the, of the environment that is conducive towards the zombiosis.
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:05.820]  What if I'm just a regular guy?
[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:07.980]  What if you're just a lazy bum?
[02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:12.700]  Maybe you are just a bum, a contrarian bum that will never get the perfect thing you
[02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:13.700]  really want.
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:14.700]  Owen, go ahead.
[02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:15.700]  Sorry.
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:17.380]  Well, I'm just trying, I'm just trying to figure out, is it a comfort thing?
[02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:20.980]  Like, if you really want me to answer that question, I mean, like, what, why do you want
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:21.980]  to live at home?
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:23.180]  Like, what is the deal with that?
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:24.660]  Why don't you want to get out?
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:26.180]  I don't want to live at home.
[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:33.500]  What I've, what I told other reporters is that when I, when I had my son, he was a baby
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:37.940]  and I had him three full days a week, two week full weekdays and one weekend day.
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:39.940]  And it was really hard for me to find full-time employment like that.
[02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:40.940]  Wait a second.
[02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:41.940]  Hold on a second.
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:42.940]  This is blowing my mind.
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:43.940]  You're a white male.
[02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:44.940]  You're an effing white male.
[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:50.700]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:52.500]  What?
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:56.620]  It's obviously an inside joke that you haven't heard yet, but apparently, you know, white
[02:11:56.620 --> 02:12:00.260]  man has the white man privilege, so you're telling me you can't get a job so that you
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:01.260]  can move out of the house.
[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:02.260]  That's what you're telling me.
[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:03.260]  I didn't say that.
[02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:07.260]  I said that it wasn't really, I didn't have a lot of opportunities with all those days
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:10.940]  that I was, you know, being a father to my son, which was important and necessary.
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:12.580]  But do you have visiting rights right now?
[02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:13.580]  No.
[02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:14.580]  So what are you so busy with?
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:15.580]  I'm still trying to figure this out.
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:16.580]  Trying to get to see him again.
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:18.980]  That's what I've been for a long time.
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:22.300]  So you're battling with the courts and with lawyers right now?
[02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:23.300]  Yes, the courts.
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:24.300]  Oh, yeah, lawyer.
[02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:25.300]  Yeah, courts and lawyers.
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:26.300]  You're exactly right.
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:27.300]  Okay.
[02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:29.140]  Don't you think it might be advantageous for you to maybe, like, get some money behind
[02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:31.700]  this effort and maybe hire a lawyer?
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:35.180]  It's not going to change the merit of my intentions.
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:37.300]  Yeah, but it might help you, don't you think?
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:39.260]  I mean, this is a court of law.
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:40.620]  How would that help?
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:43.020]  Just by saying the magic words?
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:46.980]  I mean, dude, if you don't know how the judicial system works, I mean, clearly you don't.
[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:50.540]  Well, let me tell you, my ex-wife took the kids and filed up for.
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:54.860]  I'd only have them four hours on the weekend and I went and got lawyers and went and had
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:57.500]  a big court battle and, you know, got my kids half the time.
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:59.180]  Have you ever been on your own, Michael?
[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:00.420]  Have you ever been out of the parents' house?
[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:01.420]  I have.
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:02.700]  And what was that like for you?
[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:03.700]  Did you not like it?
[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:04.700]  No, I loved it.
[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:05.700]  It was great.
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:08.260]  You know, you're very busy all the time.
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:10.300]  You got to work, you know.
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:20.340]  I think you should take up something like kickboxing or something athletic.
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:22.420]  Are you engaged in any athletic pursuits?
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:24.140]  I like to bicycle.
[02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:25.780]  Oh, it's you.
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:26.780]  Ride my bicycle.
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:27.780]  Another Bernie Sanders favorite.
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:28.780]  Is it?
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:29.780]  Mm-hmm.
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:31.340]  Is he around?
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:42.780]  How would you like, how would you like to be Bernie Sanders assistant?
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:44.940]  Probably wouldn't like to assist someone else.
[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:49.180]  Ah, I just figure because he wants to take care of everybody that's poor and then he's
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:50.180]  helped.
[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:51.180]  So I think he should give you a job.
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:54.980]  But you're not going to have any leftists actually offer anybody jobs.
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:14:01.020]  That's conservatives that do that.
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:04.340]  Are you breastfed?
[02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:05.900]  I don't remember.
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:09.980]  That's actually very important because the fatty acids in natural breast milk give you
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:13.820]  your brain a lot more power to develop than the formula.
[02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:17.780]  Yeah, well, I mean, the brain will actually weigh 10 to 15 percent less, have a lot less
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:19.500]  of a neuron density.
[02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:23.140]  So let me ask Michael, how old is your, how old is your child?
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:24.140]  Eight.
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:25.140]  Eight.
[02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:26.780]  So you had that child at age 22?
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:27.780]  That's right.
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:31.220]  And so for eight years you've been fighting for custody or I mean, how does this go?
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:36.260]  Well, when he was a baby, I really, I really wasn't feasible for me to work full time after
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:37.260]  he started going to school.
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:39.780]  It's like it's never feasible for you to work full time.
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:41.940]  You know, I don't think anybody would like to work full time.
[02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:45.580]  You know, everybody would like to just retire or live in someone's house.
[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:48.780]  But I mean, you know, me, I want to, I want to work 24 hours a day.
[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:51.740]  I was, um, I had lost my job prior to that.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:52.740]  I was fired.
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:54.340]  I was a little frustrated with employment.
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:15:00.140]  But after I had my son, after I was a father for a while, I found that I had the gift that
[02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:06.960]  public schools offer us, which is, you know, the time to work with our kids, uh, kept taking
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:08.460]  care of at school.
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:09.460]  And I found that I could.
[02:15:09.460 --> 02:15:12.340]  As you see the WikiLeaks where Hillary said, I hate my constituents, they're a bunch of
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:16.260]  basement dwellers and they're a bunch of idiot baristas, well, a lot of baristas, a lot of
[02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:20.740]  baristas that live really good lives, but, but, but that's who she thinks her, her people
[02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:21.740]  are.
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:23.820]  And they're all folks that can't get out of their parents' basement because the economy
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:27.460]  is so bad in their area and the family decides that live together, so they can have extra
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:28.460]  money.
[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:29.460]  And that's kind of a smart thing.
[02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:33.500]  If the family decides to live together, you know, in a post industrial economy, I don't
[02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:36.500]  put people down to live with their parents, if the family works together or a lot of folks
[02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:37.660]  take care of their parents.
[02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:43.380]  I'm putting down the fact that you, like so many other millennials and trendies, don't
[02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:49.340]  have any aspirations for life in the world, except politically running my life.
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:52.860]  You don't have the whole liberal control free contingent though, so you're a little bit
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:53.860]  different.
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:54.860]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:59.020]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:00.980]  Fire your stockbroker and hire yourself.
[02:16:00.980 --> 02:16:05.020]  I'm Scott Bauer and I've been a professional trader for over 25 years.
[02:16:05.020 --> 02:16:09.100]  I've traded for Goldman Sachs and was the first Amazon market maker at the Chicago

[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:17.460]  people how to trade the markets.

[02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:37.700]  government ever.
[02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:42.540]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by
[02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:43.540]  a shadow government.
[02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:46.660]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people

[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:25.100]  Start listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:37.900]  You found it at the tip of the spear, I'm Alex Jones, and Michael Ratondo, the 30-year-old
[02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:40.700]  who refused to move out of his parents' house, had taken to court.
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:43.420]  The judge said, yeah, you got to get out.
[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:46.340]  Liberal media, conservative media made fun of him and said, what a bum, what a horrible
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.340]  person.
[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:51.780]  I was talking to Owen Shroyer during the break, and I said, what is your prognosis?
[02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:52.780]  You're a smart guy.
[02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:55.580]  You've got some of the other folks in there, and they pretty much all come up with the
[02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:57.900]  same conclusion that I have in my heart.
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:20:58.900]  I think it's this.
[02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:00.900]  Owen, give us your take.
[02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:05.260]  Well, I think that you've just never had anybody really empower you.
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:09.980]  You've never felt that anyone has had faith in you or trust in you, so you've never felt
[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:14.100]  the inclination to make more of yourself because you don't feel like anyone's ever believed
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:15.100]  in you.
[02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:19.420]  And when I saw that moment when Alex handed you the check, but also talked about maybe
[02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:23.260]  hiring you, there was an emotion that I think came over you.
[02:21:23.260 --> 02:21:26.420]  And I saw it in your face that it felt like for the first time, somebody was willing to
[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:30.940]  invest in you, and that was empowering for you to have that feeling that somebody is
[02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:33.940]  willing to stick their neck out there for you and invest in you.
[02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:36.140]  And I think for a lot of people, that's all it takes sometimes.
[02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:40.500]  This is that little push of somebody having faith in you and investing in you that gets
[02:21:40.500 --> 02:21:41.500]  you going.
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:43.580]  And by the way, the globalists believe everybody's already done, so they're trying to dump people
[02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:46.260]  down to control them to then depopulate.
[02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:49.540]  And that's what this whole anti-man, anti-woman agenda is.
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:52.980]  They admit in the WikiLeaks and the government documents the whole gay agenda is about that.
[02:21:52.980 --> 02:21:54.380]  I'm not bashing gay people.
[02:21:54.380 --> 02:21:55.380]  That's always happened.
[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:56.380]  That's always been there.
[02:21:56.380 --> 02:21:59.700]  But the artificiality pushing it is about depopulation.
[02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:04.700]  And so people are going into these Asperger's type things that are artificial from the programming,
[02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:08.540]  from the television, from the internet, and we're hypocrites.
[02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:10.020]  We're on this thing too.
[02:22:10.020 --> 02:22:11.020]  That's how we're reaching people.
[02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:14.660]  But I'm telling you, I see this in more and more young people.
[02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:20.420]  I know you are 30, but I'm seeing this in a lot of males, especially, who don't thrive
[02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:21.580]  in the outside world.
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:27.300]  People don't have barbecues outside at night, like when I was a kid, people were still outside
[02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:28.300]  most of the time.
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:34.100]  Maybe we watch a Saturday night movie or cartoons on Saturday morning, or there was a big event
[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:35.300]  turned on the news.
[02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:36.300]  But we were outside.
[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:42.260]  We were doing things, baseball, football, fistfights, kissing the girls behind the bleachers, going
[02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:44.620]  fishing, all that stuff.
[02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:45.620]  That's all gone now.
[02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:47.980]  And I'm saying, you are very common.
[02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:48.980]  You are not this.
[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:50.660]  Look at the biggest bomb in the world.
[02:22:50.660 --> 02:22:53.100]  You are just one permutation of the sickness.
[02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:54.100]  Owen?
[02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:59.100]  Well, I'll just say this, and if there's anybody else that wants to talk to Michael here.
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:00.100]  I think you're right, Alex.
[02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:01.740]  I think this is a common issue.
[02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:05.460]  And it's different than the government just saying, oh, you know, here's a check or welfare
[02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:06.940]  or a hand up or everything.
[02:23:06.940 --> 02:23:08.180]  That doesn't really empower you.
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:09.340]  That doesn't really influence you.
[02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:14.620]  That makes you want to get more comfortable, whereas if a person invests in you, now you're
[02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:18.900]  answering to them, and there's an actual human experience there.
[02:23:18.900 --> 02:23:22.100]  There's a bonding experience there that can make a man a man.
[02:23:22.100 --> 02:23:24.180]  So I think that that's the big difference here.
[02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:26.900]  And I think that this is just something that a lot of people lack.
[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:27.900]  They don't have leadership.
[02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:31.260]  They don't, whether it's in a family or in school or whatever it is, they just don't
[02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:33.700]  have somebody that's willing to invest in them.
[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:35.300]  And I'll just say this in closing.
[02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:36.300]  You know, I don't know.
[02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:43.420]  I don't know what you think the best options are right now for you to get your kid back.
[02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:47.540]  But I would say your best option is to work your tail off and get a great job.
[02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:49.340]  And yeah, make some, make some money.
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.340]  Get your own home.
[02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:54.660]  And that, and then the judge for one episode, one more segment when saw man comes on with
[02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:58.300]  you when we're plugging your big veteran special is coming up today on the war room
[02:23:58.300 --> 02:24:03.420]  and saw man, former Navy SEAL Patriot, his buddy just got the congressional medal honor
[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:04.420]  yesterday.
[02:24:04.420 --> 02:24:05.420]  Pretty big deal.
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:08.140]  So we'll, we're going to be breaking all that down and headed into Memorial Day.
[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:09.140]  But a great point.
[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:13.460]  So when, and again, jump in any time, Michael, again, the man that's 30 years old, being
[02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:17.460]  evicted from his parents' house in court this week, if you just tuned in and let's bring
[02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:22.740]  in Daria or let's bring in Jake Lloyd or let's bring in any other folks that want to get
[02:24:22.740 --> 02:24:23.740]  on there.
[02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:24.740]  Well, I want to answer his question.
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:25.740]  Go ahead.
[02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:30.020]  What he said was, you know, that he alluded to the fact that he believed that I had never
[02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:31.420]  had someone who believed in me.
[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:32.420]  And that's not true.
[02:24:32.420 --> 02:24:33.780]  I've had grade school teachers who've believed in me.
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:37.180]  I think everyone has had that, but I don't think it happens enough.
[02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:44.620]  And I think that a lot of what you're speaking to with, with the things that you wish, you
[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:48.380]  know, things that you wish would change comes from the schools.
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:51.860]  Well, you need to not, here's the deal, you need to not procrastinate, you need to let
[02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:56.860]  yourself be in other organizations and not at the top and learn that if you just execute
[02:24:56.860 --> 02:24:59.140]  and innovate, you'll be moved to the top immediately.
[02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:00.140]  All right.
[02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:05.020]  But people are looking for people who will just do what they're told, understand the
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:07.340]  information and then move up in the hierarchy of things.
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:11.100]  And you'll find what you move up in the hierarchy of things that it's actually a big responsibility.
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:16.180]  But it does advance your mental clarity, understanding as you learn how to deal with more responsibility,
[02:25:16.180 --> 02:25:17.180]  more stress, you understand?
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:18.180]  Yeah.
[02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:21.100]  And that's what the whole hierarchy of needs in life is about.
[02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:25.020]  And it's about ascending to the level of where you actually want to then help others like
[02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:27.020]  your son, which you want to do.
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:29.500]  So you aspire to that is not a helping is my son.
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:34.020]  I know, but you have to sacrifice and not do things the way you want them every time
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:37.020]  to get in the position to get your son back.
[02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:39.020]  Maybe.
[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:41.540]  No.
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:43.660]  Without sacrifice, there's nothing, my friend.
[02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:47.060]  Let's bring Jake Lloyd in and Drew wants to get in whoever else.
[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:48.060]  Yeah.
[02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:51.500]  So I guess what I'm wondering is where is your motivation?
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:54.660]  Like, did you ever have any dreams when you're a kid?
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:56.660]  Did you have any motivation or anything?
[02:25:56.660 --> 02:25:59.260]  Because I guess it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:01.180]  I joined the army at 17.
[02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:02.180]  I got out.
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:03.180]  I'm working here now.
[02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:04.180]  I'm 21 years old.
[02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:07.180]  And I feel like I'm not motivated enough because I measure up.
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:11.300]  I measure myself against people in the past, like Teddy Roosevelt, people who are doing
[02:26:11.300 --> 02:26:12.660]  great things in the past.
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:13.660]  Yeah.
[02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:14.660]  And I'm doing what I'm doing now.
[02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:15.660]  It's good.
[02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:16.660]  But it's not that.
[02:26:16.660 --> 02:26:17.660]  So I don't, I guess I'm just curious.
[02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:18.660]  Where is your motivation in life?
[02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:21.860]  And if it's to get your son back, what are you doing to get him back?
[02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:24.460]  Because you say, oh, he's incredibly important to me.
[02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:28.380]  He's all that I, you know, the biggest thing in my life, but that doesn't seem to be true
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:31.900]  because you're not acting that out in your life.
[02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:38.380]  I've been going through a very arduous and costly and time-consuming legal process to
[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:43.340]  try and get him back based on the fact that I was entitled to get him back, not based
[02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:46.260]  on the fact that I need to have a job.
[02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:47.820]  You do need a job.
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:48.820]  You do need a job.
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:49.820]  People need, people need income.
[02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:50.820]  Yeah.
[02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:51.820]  You need a job.
[02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:56.700]  Unless you described on air in an off air that the court basically found you incompetent.
[02:26:56.700 --> 02:26:59.540]  That is a reasonable characterization of what happened yet.
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:02.060]  Because it is incompetent if you won't get out of your parents' house at 30.
[02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:06.100]  It is incompetent if you won't do the things it takes to get stuff done.
[02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:08.100]  I mean, that's not fair to the kid.
[02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:09.140]  That's not fair to your kid at all.
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:13.020]  If you're going to not have a job, if you're going to live at your parents' house, I mean,
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:17.020]  that's not raising him properly and you're trying to jump on you here, man, I'm trying
[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:19.020]  to help you.
[02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:20.700]  All right.
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:22.300]  Have you ever been in a physical fight?
[02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:23.300]  Yeah.
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:24.860]  I'm not saying that's a great thing.
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:26.860]  That's generally, a lot of folks...
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:28.340]  It happens to a lot of people.
[02:27:28.340 --> 02:27:30.740]  How old were you?
[02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:31.740]  Which time?
[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:33.260]  I'm just seeing if you've lived any.
[02:27:33.260 --> 02:27:34.740]  Have I lived any?
[02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:35.740]  Yes.
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:36.740]  Yeah.
[02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:37.740]  All right.
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:38.740]  Great points, Jake, Lloyd.
[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:39.740]  Let's bring in the next question.
[02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:40.740]  Who wants to get in here for next?
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:41.740]  Can y'all hear me?
[02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:42.740]  I'm on.
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:43.740]  I can hear you.
[02:27:43.740 --> 02:27:44.740]  Great.
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:45.740]  We're going to hold you over.
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:46.740]  Start your question.
[02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:53.100]  So, I'm naturally lazy as well.
[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:58.580]  But with that being said, I'm almost 30 now, done a lot of stuff with my life.
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:03.140]  So, what I'm really asking you is, what has, besides your kid, what has been your biggest
[02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:09.740]  achievement since you've been an adult?
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:13.900]  I have not considered anything like that.
[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:14.900]  My biggest achievement...
[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:15.900]  Lossed it.
[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:16.900]  What's that?
[02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:21.140]  You haven't considered anything in achievements since then?
[02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:22.140]  No.
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:25.500]  I'm trying to think of one thing that I would consider to be an achievement, and I'm having
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:27.300]  a hard time.
[02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:28.300]  That seems to be a problem.
[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:29.300]  Yeah, that's a bit.
[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:30.300]  Stay there, Drew.
[02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:31.900]  I'll tell you your achievement.
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:32.900]  What?
[02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:35.900]  You finally started to fight when they kicked your ass out of the nest, which is the beginning
[02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:38.900]  of how they're trying to help you, and now you're on it for us.
[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:40.900]  Because I'm a slacker?
[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:42.900]  Or was I a slacker?
[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:44.700]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:51.700]  We're going to transform you from slacker man to super hair man.

[02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:12.020]  asbestos exposure.
[02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:15.060]  How do you protect your rights and get the compensation you deserve?

[02:30:55.940 --> 02:31:02.260]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:08.660]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:15.900]  or videos or other material from InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:20.820]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:21.820]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:25.500]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste

[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:30.660]  You cannot beat that.
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:34.700]  For children and adults, we've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my
[02:31:34.700 --> 02:31:41.620]  dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA2533139, and
[02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:46.020]  your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:49.940]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are,
[02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:55.940]  and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:31:55.940 --> 02:32:01.500]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending
[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:03.620]  down over the U.K.
[02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:09.300]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get
[02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:11.460]  six months in prison.
[02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:15.020]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the U.K.
[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:20.020]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:25.660]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship, brainwash young people
[02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:30.460]  against InfoWars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear
[02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:31.860]  what we have to say.
[02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:34.860]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:40.500]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, or slash newsletter, and sign up for the free
[02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:45.380]  newsletter so we can be in contact with you, and so the censors can bully their way in
[02:32:45.380 --> 02:32:51.100]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society that is critical
[02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:52.100]  to this fight.
[02:32:52.100 --> 02:32:59.100]  We'll prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:51.100]  Alright, Craig Shroyer, I just crossed their names, Owen Shroyer and Sawman is also a
[02:33:51.100 --> 02:33:57.100]  here with us today, so there's so much to get to, so much to go over, there's going to
[02:33:57.100 --> 02:34:02.100]  be a veteran special today that they're going to have for three hours, Owen Shroyer and
[02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:03.740]  Craig Shroyer.
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:07.340]  That's like saying she shucks she-shells by the sea shore.
[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:11.860]  I'm having trouble saying it, both names are easy to say, but when you say them combined
[02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:18.860]  together it gets a little hard, so Owen Shroyer and Craig Sawyer, veterans call in special
[02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:22.940]  show ahead of Memorial Day this Monday, a voice for our veterans, what's happening in
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:27.100]  the VA, what they think of Trump, all the things that are happening, the good, the bad,
[02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:33.620]  and the ugly, that's at 3pm today in about an hour and a half from now.
[02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:40.380]  Please tell everybody about infowars.com, or slash show, please share the link for folks,
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:43.860]  and please tell people about the local radio and TV stations that you're tuning into.
[02:34:43.860 --> 02:34:48.660]  We'll be talking to Craig and Owen in the next segment about what's coming up in the
[02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:50.300]  war room today.
[02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:54.180]  Roger Stone's also supposed to pop in right now, but I may just do that in the first
[02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:57.780]  five minutes of the next hour, just to point out that he's now been told by the Mueller
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:02.860]  people, yeah, it's not Russiagate, we're looking at your finances to put your ass in prison,
[02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:07.860]  and you better, they've telegraphed, you better turn your back on the president.
[02:35:07.860 --> 02:35:12.580]  And Giuliani went on Fox and said, they know Roger's not going to do that, Roger told me
[02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:16.620]  last night and he said today on the news that he's not turning his back, because there's
[02:35:16.620 --> 02:35:21.820]  nothing to turn his back on, there's nothing been done, nothing illegal, nothing wrong,
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:22.820]  no nothing.
[02:35:22.820 --> 02:35:28.020]  And so Craig, talking to you, your buddy also just won the Congressional Medal of Honor
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:32.300]  yesterday from the same team that you were on, I guess it's nicknamed SLAB, you're going
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:35.700]  to be breaking that down as well, so tell us what's coming up.
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:41.820]  Well, yeah, Britt Slavinsky was on my sniper crew for years, and the SEAL teams, he's a
[02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:47.420]  great guy, and he got the Medal of Honor yesterday from the president, it was an ugly battle,
[02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:52.380]  and a lot of heartache there, and I know SLAB didn't even want the award, he's been
[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:59.180]  awarded heavily prior to that, and he's a warrior in every sense of the word, and he's
[02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:05.860]  reluctant recipient of that award due to the brothers left that we lost in that battle,
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:10.900]  but that's the nature of battle, it's imperfect, SLAB is a great warrior, but it's good to
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:16.660]  see him recognize, and all the guys at that level really deserve to be recognized for
[02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:22.020]  it, great warriors defending our homeland against the unthinkable, so God bless them
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:23.420]  all.
[02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:26.900]  I know on air, you'll really never talk about any of the operations you've been part of,
[02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:31.860]  obviously, because that's all classified, and are we even able to know the specifics
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:34.820]  of why you got the Congressional Medal of Honor?
[02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:42.660]  Yeah, they talked through the citation live on national television, the president actually
[02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:43.660]  read it.
[02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:46.780]  Well, I missed that yesterday because I was so busy with other things, so we're going
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:50.420]  to re-air that today coming up during the war, and we'll find that and air that, because
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:51.420]  that's important.
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:56.500]  Yeah, man, yeah, those guys deserve to be recognized, and SLAB deserves to be recognized
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:37:00.900]  for his contributions on the field of battle there, just amazing stuff.
[02:37:00.900 --> 02:37:05.340]  Now, let's juxtapose that, not in the mean way, I'm sure you heard of Michael Ratondo,
[02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:09.300]  the 30-year-old that wouldn't get out of his parents' house?
[02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:14.340]  Only briefly, I've been quite busy running our operations for the children, Alex, so
[02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:16.580]  I get glimpses of the news.
[02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:20.260]  And that's what we'll talk about next segment, boy, is Trump, and you guys and everybody
[02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:24.100]  really delivering, there are just massive pedophile roundups going on, but we can't
[02:37:24.100 --> 02:37:28.020]  get into it all, the numbers are out there, like eight, nine times the previous number
[02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:32.820]  under Obama, and the left's really panicking, and more and more of this is coming out, but
[02:37:32.820 --> 02:37:35.500]  that's definitely panicking the globalists right now.
[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:43.460]  Yeah, yeah, well, there's a massive struggle for power over the United States, and we see
[02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:49.500]  it getting more desperate on the left, on the globalist side, as Trump makes more progress
[02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:54.340]  and gets his footing as Commander-in-Chief of the United States and starts exposing
[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:59.620]  more of the truth, the globalists and the radical left are getting more and more desperate.
[02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:04.740]  So it's interesting, these are interesting times, highly contested, so we'll stand by
[02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:05.740]  and watch.
[02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:08.100]  We're breaking it down here in a few minutes, finishing up, and I'm going to do a special
[02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:13.100]  broadcast with you later, I'm really trying to find out why you and so many other millennials
[02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:20.420]  are so timid, afraid to leave the house, lazy, I'm not trying to be mean, but we've got
[02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:24.740]  Drew and so many other folks have questions for it, and you can respond back if you want.
[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:26.340]  I've got some mallets, you don't mind?
[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:27.340]  Sure.
[02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:28.340]  Can I interject?
[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:34.660]  I would just encourage him, look, if you love somebody, you want them empowered, man,
[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:40.500]  I teach my son everything that I can, and take on a little league football team, man,
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:42.220]  they train those boys hard, why?
[02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:46.940]  Because they want them to be prepared to win or to perform well during the game, and we
[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:49.100]  all want that for our kids, man.
[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:53.180]  And so sometimes love, if you really care about somebody, you want them empowered, and
[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:59.740]  growth is always difficult, it's sometimes painful, but it's beneficial.
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:05.700]  So I would encourage this guy, hey look, his life has been what it has been until now,
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:11.340]  but before him lies unlimited potential, and I would say push through the discomfort of
[02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:16.820]  growing into a more responsible man and going for his better self.
[02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:21.060]  Exactly, because I saw the media just put him down and calling names, and I'm trying
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:24.060]  to kick him in the butt to get him thinking, but if you look at how we have to pay for
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:29.340]  all the illegal aliens and all the anchor babies, and for people's sex changes, that's
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:34.180]  far more lazy and bad than him, so then how is he the worst guy in America, is basically
[02:39:34.180 --> 02:39:37.020]  what they said this week, and then they ignore all the rest of this stuff.
[02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:41.060]  He becomes a scapegoat, I'm not saying you're a victim, I'm just saying on a scale of laziness,
[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:43.700]  you're kind of in the middle, you're not the worst guy.
[02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:44.700]  It sounds reasonable.
[02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:48.860]  I wanted to answer a question I got earlier, where someone asked me what my greatest accomplishment
[02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:54.260]  was, and it's my belief that I've raised a child who is smarter than I was.
[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:55.260]  Besides your son?
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:56.260]  Well, besides that.
[02:39:56.260 --> 02:40:00.580]  Yeah, besides your son, what has been your greatest achievement since you turned 18?
[02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:01.980]  That's what I prepared, is the answer for that.
[02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:02.980]  You prepared it?
[02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:03.980]  Yeah.
[02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:06.900]  That's the problem, it took you that long through the break to think of one, though.
[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:09.060]  How am I supposed to come in before the break?
[02:40:09.060 --> 02:40:12.860]  Without that, would you say that your life has been fulfilling?
[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:15.260]  Yeah.
[02:40:15.260 --> 02:40:20.780]  In what way being as though you haven't, you can't even find out what you've achieved,
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:25.260]  you can't even answer what you've achieved, how do you feel fulfilled?
[02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:33.020]  I feel like I can accomplish what I seek to, or if I can't accomplish what I was attempting
[02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:36.340]  to, I've made accomplishments in order to get there.
[02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:40.180]  Well, listen, I'm not trying to put you down, thanks, Drew, let's bring Darion, let's make
[02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:43.780]  her get on here, because I know she said some comments, she didn't want to get on here,
[02:40:43.780 --> 02:40:44.780]  but she said she did earlier.
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:45.780]  Did Darion get over here?
[02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:48.300]  Because I'm not trying to be mean to you, you've got to get out of the comfort zone,
[02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:49.300]  like you said.
[02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:53.980]  And just do little things, just get a job.
[02:40:53.980 --> 02:40:55.980]  Well I just think Alex, you said something.
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:56.980]  That's not Darion.
[02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:59.380]  She refuses to go on.
[02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:03.700]  I think that Alex was right, though, Michael, your greatest accomplishment was this legal
[02:41:03.700 --> 02:41:06.380]  battle with your parents to live at home or not live at home.
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:08.580]  You finally fought for something.
[02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:11.980]  This is going to be the moment in your life that changes everything.
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:12.980]  I have a feeling for it.
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:14.300]  You have good energy, Michael.
[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:15.300]  Thank you.
[02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:16.500]  We're trying to be positive.
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:17.980]  Darion was going to get on here.
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:20.060]  I don't know where she is.
[02:41:20.060 --> 02:41:23.580]  Does anybody else, the minute and a half we have left, want to talk to him?
[02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:24.580]  Go ahead.
[02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:25.580]  Can I ask you a question?
[02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:26.580]  Do you want to ask?
[02:41:26.580 --> 02:41:27.580]  I want to question her, man.
[02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:28.580]  Can I ask you a question?
[02:41:28.580 --> 02:41:29.580]  Yeah, what's up?
[02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:32.380]  Or no, I forgot what this gentleman's name is over here.
[02:41:32.380 --> 02:41:33.380]  Drew?
[02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:34.380]  Drew.
[02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:35.380]  Drew, get Drew on here.
[02:41:35.380 --> 02:41:36.380]  No, this gentleman.
[02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:37.380]  Who's the guy?
[02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:38.380]  Sawman.
[02:41:38.380 --> 02:41:39.380]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:40.380]  Go ahead, buddy.
[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:43.380]  Is that on your birth certificate, Sawman?
[02:41:43.380 --> 02:41:44.380]  Craig Sawyer.
[02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:45.380]  Right, sir.
[02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:46.380]  He was a mall cop.
[02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:50.780]  Craig, feel free to just disregard my question because it's complicated.
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:51.780]  Do you have a scope?
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:54.980]  Do you have a theater scale where you can-
[02:41:54.980 --> 02:41:56.980]  We set a minute and a half, buddy, so be quick.
[02:41:56.980 --> 02:42:02.340]  Do you have a theater scale where you can share with us the scope of some of the things
[02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:07.820]  that these men who've been awarded the Medal of Honor, can you share with us what they've
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:08.820]  done?
[02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:15.580]  Well, that would take about 5,000 hours for this thing here or for that thing there.
[02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:17.700]  The word hero exists for guys like that.
[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:18.700]  I mean, that's what they do.
[02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:19.700]  They earn it.
[02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:24.820]  They disregard their own safety, and they run to save their buddies from the unthinkable.
[02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:27.780]  They fight through things that normal people would not.
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:31.820]  That's what the Medal of Honor is all about, and that's how we celebrate those who earn
[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:32.820]  it.
[02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:35.220]  Can't talk about anything specifically about what they were involved in.
[02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:39.380]  We're going to get to this one because this was declassified when he's hosting for three
[02:42:39.380 --> 02:42:40.380]  hours coming up.
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:42.540]  We're going to pull that up.
[02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:44.500]  The gentleman getting the Medal of Honor yesterday at the seal.
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:49.460]  Listen, we're going to be talking more once the show's over, so you've done a great job.
[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:52.340]  You can make $3,000 coming here as part of capitalism.
[02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:53.340]  See how that did for you?
[02:42:53.340 --> 02:42:54.340]  Are you happy so far with-
[02:42:54.340 --> 02:42:55.340]  Yes, you got out of the house.
[02:42:55.340 --> 02:42:56.340]  See what happened.
[02:42:56.340 --> 02:42:59.380]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[02:42:59.380 --> 02:43:04.740]  Between debt crisis, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply
[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:07.180]  of storable meals is crucial.

[02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:55.700]  with InfoWars life-selects storable foods.

[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:03.580]  it right.

[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:41.580]  America, it's wonderful, we're all living in America, America, America, we're back live
[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:42.580]  ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:42.580 --> 02:47:44.580]  We're getting Craig back on the skype drop.
[02:47:44.580 --> 02:47:49.620]  Hey Owen Schreuer, you're going to be hosting a three hour transmission with Craig, a veterans
[02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:50.620]  call in.
[02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:54.020]  Just for veterans to call in, obviously you'll be covering some of the news, but that's coming
[02:47:54.020 --> 02:47:55.940]  up in about an hour and 13 minutes.
[02:47:55.940 --> 02:48:02.860]  With the war room, you see the attack that InfoWars is under and I haven't even plugged
[02:48:02.860 --> 02:48:06.820]  maybe one minute, a minute and a half the last two hours plush.
[02:48:06.820 --> 02:48:11.180]  Most talks show host plug every segment, I should plug every segment, then I wouldn't
[02:48:11.180 --> 02:48:15.780]  ever sit up here and freak out about expanding in the face of the globalist, but people have
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:16.780]  to understand.
[02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:22.620]  There's something called Trumpnesia with a lot of people who think, since Trump's saying
[02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:26.060]  everything's okay, the total war is on right now.
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:30.660]  A lot of people get that, a lot of people don't, but you can tell who does get it.
[02:48:30.660 --> 02:48:35.420]  The left are in their maximum push and the more desperate they get, the more desperate
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:36.420]  they get.
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:39.220]  The more out of control they get, the more out of control they get.
[02:48:39.220 --> 02:48:45.500]  The more they lie, it doesn't work, they quadruple and quintuple and just leverage it into total
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:47.500]  cloud cuckoo land.
[02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:51.300]  And we are winning, but let me tell you, and I'm not complaining, I asked for this.
[02:48:51.300 --> 02:48:56.100]  I just don't want to personally have the pleasure of tearing us to pieces because they're certainly
[02:48:56.100 --> 02:49:00.540]  trying and as you can see all over the news, the good news is, I led the broadcast with
[02:49:00.540 --> 02:49:03.260]  this woman, get Craig back on separate from the veterans.
[02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:07.700]  That's important because he's helping with a lot of folks, lead the charts around the
[02:49:07.700 --> 02:49:09.700]  pedophile rings and all the rest of it.
[02:49:09.700 --> 02:49:14.700]  It's really happening and everything we were told about Weinstein is now coming out thanks
[02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:20.580]  to Schneiderman getting removed, he was protecting him and this is the real counter-strike.
[02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:27.300]  This is Trump's counter-strike as we told you was coming in November of 2016 and Drudge
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:31.380]  linking to our spirit cooking articles and exposing the pedophile rings and then them
[02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:35.820]  creating side diversions that were honey pots for us were not perfect, some of us fell into
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:36.820]  them.
[02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:42.460]  We were in negotiations with Pizzagate, but now the real counter-offensive is taking place.
[02:49:42.460 --> 02:49:43.460]  This is a big deal.
[02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:44.460]  Owen?
[02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:48.460]  Well, like you said, I mean, even the night of the election though, Alex, you had some
[02:49:48.460 --> 02:49:52.700]  reservations about celebrating because you said, I know that the left is going to push
[02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:53.700]  back.
[02:49:53.700 --> 02:49:56.900]  You know, we just had a major victory, but the globalists are not going to go away.
[02:49:56.900 --> 02:49:57.900]  You know, they've invested.
[02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:03.820]  Well, it's like you take a port in a war, but then 50 ships come pulling around the corner
[02:50:03.820 --> 02:50:04.820]  to retake it.
[02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:05.820]  I mean, we're in a war.
[02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:07.340]  We have not won the war yet.
[02:50:07.340 --> 02:50:10.980]  Yeah, we we won a Death Star level destruction event.
[02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:13.940]  But as we all know, just because you blow the Death Star up, that means the Empire is
[02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:14.940]  still laying out there.
[02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:17.260]  Well, the globalists have a survival instinct, too.
[02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:20.140]  And their ideology has a survival instinct.
[02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:23.500]  And that's the key here that I actually broke down with Doug Hagman yesterday on the war
[02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:30.140]  room is that the reason why they're engaged in such heinous activity, abusing the power
[02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:36.140]  of the FBI, the DIJ, the NSA, the CIA, the reason why they're so unabashed in their fake
[02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:41.340]  news and their lies, we're even still, I mean, Alex, this is like, even after James Clapper
[02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:46.460]  has admitted the FBI had spies, he said, he said, we spied on Trump, though I don't like
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:48.460]  to call it that close quote, the view.
[02:50:48.460 --> 02:50:50.100]  They're saying we're making it up.
[02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:51.100]  They still deny it.
[02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:53.180]  Adam Schiff on Twitter, Eric Swall on Twitter.
[02:50:53.180 --> 02:50:54.180]  There was no spying.
[02:50:54.180 --> 02:50:55.180]  It's fake news from the right.
[02:50:55.180 --> 02:50:58.580]  And it's like, wait a second, we just got that from James Clapper, even though we already
[02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:01.900]  knew that was going on, but it's all a survival instinct.
[02:51:01.900 --> 02:51:05.860]  They know that they're against the ropes, and they know that if Trump isn't defeated
[02:51:05.860 --> 02:51:08.420]  or removed from office, that they're done.
[02:51:08.420 --> 02:51:13.940]  Their stranglehold over the country, the communist, socialist, whatever you want to call it, that
[02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:18.140]  they try to bring this government down with, is in dire straits.
[02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:19.140]  Absolutely.
[02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:20.940]  And I wanted saw man on the last segment.
[02:51:20.940 --> 02:51:21.940]  They got him a little bit earlier.
[02:51:21.940 --> 02:51:26.060]  I want to get him back on, guys, and I want to get the Congressional Medal of Honor thing
[02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:29.220]  that was done on Fox yesterday, because we're going to air that before this show ends.
[02:51:29.220 --> 02:51:32.060]  I'm going to countermand or that's not the word.
[02:51:32.060 --> 02:51:35.140]  I'm going to commandeer some of the next hour.
[02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:37.700]  So I'm telegraphing that to everybody because that's about enough.
[02:51:37.700 --> 02:51:41.980]  If you want to play the full thing, it's about 20 minutes, the full entire presentation.
[02:51:41.980 --> 02:51:43.940]  So you carried it?
[02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:44.940]  I've got it.
[02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:46.420]  I've got it queued up to play on the war room.
[02:51:46.420 --> 02:51:47.420]  Okay.
[02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:50.380]  Well, I'm going to play just some of it here, then, when he gives it in the war, wherever,
[02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:51.860]  because Obama got rid of this.
[02:51:51.860 --> 02:51:55.500]  Well, and think about this, Alex, like you said, you didn't see this yesterday.
[02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:57.100]  It really didn't get much TV coverage.
[02:51:57.100 --> 02:51:59.020]  I mean, very little coverage in the Medal of Honor.
[02:51:59.020 --> 02:52:02.500]  I remember when Obama handed out an E-Award, it was a huge TV event.
[02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:04.100]  They had the whole camera crews there.
[02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:05.100]  Everybody made a big deal of it.
[02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:06.100]  But Trump hands out a Medal of Honor.
[02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:11.300]  It seems like nobody, even Bats and I, just like the MS-13 roundtable, nobody Bats and
[02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:16.140]  I, that was an incredibly powerful event, just like the Republicans in a 50-minute public
[02:52:16.140 --> 02:52:21.020]  presser announcing that it's time for a special counsel and the Clinton email investigation
[02:52:21.020 --> 02:52:22.620]  and the origins of the Trump resolution.
[02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:23.620]  I'll be back.
[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:26.620]  These things just get no coverage.
[02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:29.220]  These things get no coverage.
[02:52:29.220 --> 02:52:31.620]  And it's just incredible to think, why?
[02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:37.060]  Why wouldn't somebody cover an MS-13 roundtable where they come out with the news?
[02:52:37.060 --> 02:52:39.020]  And this is, I mean, this is huge, right?
[02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:42.620]  I mean, why wouldn't anybody be talking about gangs?
[02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:48.460]  We're talking about gangs that murder, rape, traffic and children, etc., sell drugs, all
[02:52:48.460 --> 02:52:59.860]  of it, violent gangs sneaking into this country using children, using children to get in.
[02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:02.700]  It's just like, people don't take what we say seriously.
[02:53:02.700 --> 02:53:06.860]  MS-13 knows how to get around the system.
[02:53:06.860 --> 02:53:08.900]  That's not just rhetoric.
[02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:14.180]  It's pretty simple to figure out, oh, okay, if I come in with a kid or two, they're gonna
[02:53:14.180 --> 02:53:15.680]  let me in.
[02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:18.340]  Wow, MS-13 has a brain, too.
[02:53:18.340 --> 02:53:23.020]  They bring in the kids with their gang members, and then what do you have unaccompanied children
[02:53:23.020 --> 02:53:25.140]  in the country that we have to take care of?
[02:53:25.140 --> 02:53:29.940]  And this is totally ignored by mainstream press, even though it should be top news.
[02:53:29.940 --> 02:53:31.660]  And let me expand on that.
[02:53:31.660 --> 02:53:36.900]  MS-13 is the most hated in Mexico because they're out of El Salvador.
[02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:38.380]  They're literally devil worshipers.
[02:53:38.380 --> 02:53:45.740]  They're the worst gang in, they set the precedent back 15 years ago or so to start killing kids.
[02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:50.180]  Everybody would kill kids in any Latin American gang because they had some basic chivalry.
[02:53:50.180 --> 02:53:54.740]  Now they're killing kids, something previously only Muslims would do on purpose.
[02:53:54.740 --> 02:53:57.020]  So I mean, these guys are worse than animals.
[02:53:57.020 --> 02:54:00.260]  Animals kill for food.
[02:54:00.260 --> 02:54:01.260]  Animals kill to survive.
[02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:05.600]  These people do it because it's a cult of who can be the nastiest, meanest, most disgusting
[02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:07.100]  person.
[02:54:07.100 --> 02:54:10.500]  And these are the guys that are running the Cody operations.
[02:54:10.500 --> 02:54:14.980]  These are the guys that are so ruthless, they're taking over the Mexican gangs, and the Mexican
[02:54:14.980 --> 02:54:18.500]  gangs are adopting their psychology.
[02:54:18.500 --> 02:54:24.820]  When we got 150 million Mexicans in Mexico, and you got about 20, 30 million legals here,
[02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:26.500]  you don't want them adopting this.
[02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:29.980]  I mean, this is like adopting Nazism or something.
[02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:35.900]  And the president simply says this, and they go, how dare you, you're saying Hispanics are
[02:54:35.900 --> 02:54:36.900]  animals.
[02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:40.540]  But let me just make a comment real quick on the animals thing, okay?
[02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:46.700]  So it's the entire left freaks out over Trump saying animals, wait a second, you claim we're
[02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:48.660]  animals through evolution.
[02:54:48.660 --> 02:54:53.460]  So they literally teach in science that we're animals, that's their science.
[02:54:53.460 --> 02:54:56.180]  They want their science that teaches we're animals.
[02:54:56.180 --> 02:54:59.020]  Of course, of course, although the babies aren't even humans, chop them out.
[02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:02.260]  But then Trump says animals, speaking of gang members, and they throw their hands in the
[02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:03.260]  air.
[02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:07.620]  They're chopping babies up, but now they're saying everyone has a spark of divinity.
[02:55:07.620 --> 02:55:08.980]  These are God's children.
[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:10.860]  They said, oh, well, Pelosi didn't mean them.
[02:55:10.860 --> 02:55:15.140]  Then a bunch of Democrats come out and they go, no, we mean MS-13, including Juan Williams.
[02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:19.420]  And let me add this, that's why I'm saying everybody points their fingers at Michael
[02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:21.700]  Rotondo.
[02:55:21.700 --> 02:55:25.460]  And they go, look, this guy's the biggest bum in the galaxy.
[02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:27.260]  And I think he's got some quirky issues.
[02:55:27.260 --> 02:55:29.100]  I don't think he's a bad guy.
[02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:30.940]  I think he's been shut in.
[02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:36.620]  He's nothing compared to making us pay for MS-13 to bring women in who have babies by
[02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:42.060]  design to give them an anchor in the United States to bring up to 10 more people in.
[02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:48.180]  We're paying for MS-13 women to have babies on record to pay for everything for them.
[02:55:48.180 --> 02:55:50.460]  That is BS.
[02:55:50.460 --> 02:55:53.140]  And this is what a welfare state does.
[02:55:53.140 --> 02:55:56.580]  And even though its intentions may be good, even though the intentions of whatever...
[02:55:56.580 --> 02:55:57.580]  But it's not at the top.
[02:55:57.580 --> 02:55:58.700]  You read LBJ.
[02:55:58.700 --> 02:55:59.700]  He said the blacks...
[02:55:59.700 --> 02:56:00.700]  But it never works.
[02:56:00.700 --> 02:56:01.700]  These are quotes.
[02:56:01.700 --> 02:56:03.380]  I only want to say the quotes because they'll edit and say I said it.
[02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:08.340]  He said blacks are getting uppity because they oppressed them so they created their
[02:56:08.340 --> 02:56:09.340]  own economies.
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:10.540]  And when some areas were getting wealthier than white...
[02:56:10.540 --> 02:56:12.020]  It's like Kanye West now, too.
[02:56:12.020 --> 02:56:13.020]  He's getting a little uppity.
[02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:14.860]  They need to send him back to the middle of the day.
[02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:15.860]  Exactly.
[02:56:15.860 --> 02:56:16.860]  Listen, folks, here's the bottom line.

[02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:11.460]  This is a near-lost leader, but with all the things going on in this world, it's so critical
[02:57:11.460 --> 02:57:12.460]  to be prepared.

[02:57:21.220 --> 02:57:27.140]  and help fund this operation as we prepare to launch the final main stage of 24 hours
[02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:32.780]  a day, reporters in every major region of the planet, attacking the globalists relentlessly
[02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:38.740]  on a 24-hour basis, upping our game in the face of the Soros, Clinton, EU, crime syndicate
[02:57:38.740 --> 02:57:39.740]  assault.
[02:57:39.740 --> 02:57:45.460]  Hour number four with Owen Schreuer, Alex Jones, and more, straight ahead.
[02:57:45.460 --> 02:57:50.700]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing PollenBlock.
[02:57:50.700 --> 02:57:56.020]  We have found an extraordinary, new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:57:56.020 --> 02:58:02.740]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.740 --> 02:58:08.580]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:58:08.580 --> 02:58:11.940]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.940 --> 02:58:16.580]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[02:58:16.580 --> 02:58:21.900]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[02:58:21.900 --> 02:58:22.900]  symptoms.
[02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:26.780]  If PollenBlock is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:26.780 --> 02:58:31.500]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:37.300]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.300 --> 02:58:39.980]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.980 --> 02:58:46.500]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our PollenBlock chewable tablets.
[02:58:46.500 --> 02:58:52.300]  InfoWarsLife and infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner
[02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:56.060]  Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[02:58:56.060 --> 02:59:00.620]  Winner Sun is a premium-quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[02:59:00.620 --> 02:59:05.540]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[02:59:05.540 --> 02:59:08.500]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[02:59:08.500 --> 02:59:11.100]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[02:59:11.100 --> 02:59:14.540]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[02:59:14.540 --> 02:59:18.780]  Winner Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[02:59:18.780 --> 02:59:23.060]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent
[02:59:23.060 --> 02:59:27.460]  laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[02:59:27.460 --> 02:59:32.460]  Read the facts at infowarslife.com about Winner Sun vitamin D3.
[02:59:32.460 --> 02:59:37.220]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and
[02:59:37.220 --> 02:59:40.300]  brain function, something the globalists are targeting.

[03:05:01.660 --> 03:05:02.780]  it right.

[03:05:19.180 --> 03:05:20.900]  probiotic strains.

[03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:32.620]  Roger Stone is not going to be on the war room today.
[03:06:32.620 --> 03:06:36.020]  He's getting some well-deserved rest with all the hundreds of interviews he's been
[03:06:36.020 --> 03:06:38.340]  doing and his wife has been in the hospital off and on.
[03:06:38.340 --> 03:06:39.340]  So pray for her.
[03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:45.700]  There's a veterans call-in show with Owen Schreuer and Craig Sawyer, the former dev group Navy
[03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:46.700]  Seal.
[03:06:46.700 --> 03:06:48.820]  His buddy just got the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[03:06:48.820 --> 03:06:49.820]  They're going to play some of that today.
[03:06:49.820 --> 03:06:54.620]  They're going to take veterans calls and active duty calls only to get their take on what's
[03:06:54.620 --> 03:06:56.740]  happening in the world and so much more.
[03:06:56.740 --> 03:07:03.180]  But I wanted to get Roger wrong because the ill and the Associated Press reported that
[03:07:03.180 --> 03:07:07.420]  Mueller now admits and they've talked to the people that, oh, because I guess they're getting
[03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:08.420]  the media ready for this.
[03:07:08.420 --> 03:07:12.460]  We're not getting into Russiagate or collusion with Stone and the Russians.
[03:07:12.460 --> 03:07:14.740]  We're just going to find something financial and put him in jail.
[03:07:14.740 --> 03:07:20.060]  And then you've got Giuliani saying, we're not worried, they're not going to flip him.
[03:07:20.060 --> 03:07:23.580]  And then Roger's saying, there's nothing to flip on.
[03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:26.220]  So again, Roger and I talked about this months ago.
[03:07:26.220 --> 03:07:27.220]  We talked about this weekend.
[03:07:27.220 --> 03:07:28.580]  We knew it was coming.
[03:07:28.580 --> 03:07:29.580]  Total vindication.
[03:07:29.580 --> 03:07:36.020]  They've got a magnifying glass aimed up every orifice here over every molecule of his body,
[03:07:36.020 --> 03:07:37.020]  as he said.
[03:07:37.020 --> 03:07:41.820]  And Owen didn't want to cut it at the time that Roger has, but I wanted to have Owen
[03:07:41.820 --> 03:07:46.420]  and Rod shotgun, too, because for any of his side comments or takes on this.
[03:07:46.420 --> 03:07:53.420]  But as the wheels come off of this, Roger, it looks like you're the last gasp hope they've
[03:07:53.420 --> 03:07:58.260]  got and are almost telegraphing to you in the media that you just need to roll over
[03:07:58.260 --> 03:07:59.900]  or something really bad is going to happen.
[03:07:59.900 --> 03:08:01.460]  So hang in there, buddy.
[03:08:01.460 --> 03:08:03.780]  This is like way beyond any movie I've ever seen.
[03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:06.420]  No, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:11.420]  Having come up completely empty handed in terms of any involvement in Russian collusion on
[03:08:11.420 --> 03:08:17.340]  my part, having come up empty handed on the claim that I was trafficking in allegedly
[03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:24.340]  hacked emails with WikiLeaks, they now clearly hope to conjure up some extraneous offense
[03:08:24.340 --> 03:08:29.820]  in an effort to not only silence me, but to punish me for my advocacy of the election
[03:08:29.820 --> 03:08:30.820]  of Donald Trump.
[03:08:30.820 --> 03:08:35.620]  I mean, it's really disconcerting to have a runaway federal prosecutor aggressively
[03:08:35.620 --> 03:08:42.140]  scrutinizing, picking and probing through every aspect of a personal and professional life,
[03:08:42.140 --> 03:08:50.140]  deploying platoons of federal agents to conduct this microscopic fine tooth review of my personal
[03:08:50.140 --> 03:08:55.220]  life, badgering at least eight of my current or former colleagues, asking questions about
[03:08:55.220 --> 03:09:00.500]  my private life, my business associations, my friendship and association with you with
[03:09:00.500 --> 03:09:06.740]  Info Wars, just all over the map, none of it having to do with Russian collusion or
[03:09:06.740 --> 03:09:15.100]  the 2016 election is clear that Mr. Mueller plans to target me, and of course MSNBC and
[03:09:15.100 --> 03:09:16.100]  CNN.
[03:09:16.100 --> 03:09:20.620]  They're just giddy with these reports that my criminal indictment is imminent, even though
[03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:25.500]  there is no proof of that, and they refuse to mention, oh, by the way, this has nothing
[03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:30.540]  to do with Russia or WikiLeaks or John Podesta's email and so on.
[03:09:30.540 --> 03:09:38.340]  It is really frightening, it's Big Brother writ large, it's the deep state gone amok.
[03:09:38.340 --> 03:09:42.580]  And they're obviously on their last legs, even mainstream media has to admit that Trump
[03:09:42.580 --> 03:09:47.580]  is winning, the economy's coming back, that they've been covering up, they've been lying,
[03:09:47.580 --> 03:09:50.620]  Congress is honing in on them.
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:53.020]  Is there any way they can pull a rabbit out of their hat?
[03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:57.220]  Because when I told you last weekend, I mean, I said it on air, Mueller especially, and
[03:09:57.220 --> 03:10:00.660]  I see your news article showing this, is when they've botched investigations, when they've
[03:10:00.660 --> 03:10:04.340]  been caught, when they're desperate, when they're covering up, they bring in Mueller,
[03:10:04.340 --> 03:10:09.300]  they set somebody up, they say they're to blame, and they kill them within one day of
[03:10:09.300 --> 03:10:13.860]  saying they're the person that did it, and I'm serious, you've already been shot in your
[03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:17.460]  backyard, people make jokes about it, oh, like what is this James Bond movie, yeah, you're
[03:10:17.460 --> 03:10:24.300]  at the center of the total fight for the country, in a Russiagate spy operation, they shoot
[03:10:24.300 --> 03:10:32.620]  you with a radioactive polonium dart, which again are gelatin, so they dissolve, it doesn't
[03:10:32.620 --> 03:10:36.900]  go all the way into your body because it goes in your shirt, you know, you said what your
[03:10:36.900 --> 03:10:40.420]  nephew was out there when this happened, bam, you're like, what is it, you're bleeding,
[03:10:40.420 --> 03:10:44.100]  and then you got tested, the feds asked you not to release it in the hospital, but I think
[03:10:44.100 --> 03:10:47.620]  you should, I know the feds came and threatened the hospital, you should release that, I know
[03:10:47.620 --> 03:10:53.540]  you got T-boned, and this is what they do, Mueller kills who he's going, I know your
[03:10:53.540 --> 03:10:57.100]  wife didn't like hearing that, and I don't want to say it's my fault she's been in the
[03:10:57.100 --> 03:11:00.580]  hospital, but you did say she got pretty freaked out when she heard the show, she knows I don't
[03:11:00.580 --> 03:11:05.140]  lie about stuff, but I think it's for your safety, we say that Mueller is a murderer,
[03:11:05.140 --> 03:11:09.300]  Mueller is a criminal, he covered up 9-11, they clearly from the evidence that my source
[03:11:09.300 --> 03:11:14.820]  is killed, the third Patsy and the anthrax case, they have a long history of this crap,
[03:11:14.820 --> 03:11:18.620]  and so I'm saying by exposing that, you were the one that said they were trying to kill
[03:11:18.620 --> 03:11:23.060]  you so they could then set you up a year ago, you know this yourself, so I'm only saying
[03:11:23.060 --> 03:11:24.740]  what you already know, Roger.
[03:11:24.740 --> 03:11:30.940]  Well Alex, first of all, I think we all recognize an unbridled federal prosecutor can literally
[03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:36.780]  indict a ham sandwich, but I have no interest in being Mr. Mueller's lunch, secondarily if
[03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:42.180]  anything does happen to me, I will be a martyr for the cause, and you can talk about it extensively
[03:11:42.180 --> 03:11:43.980]  here at InfoWars.
[03:11:43.980 --> 03:11:49.700]  I have no intention of rolling on this president, I have no negative information with which
[03:11:49.700 --> 03:11:56.580]  I could damage him, but if that's Mr. Mueller's goal, if it's not just silencing and banc
[03:11:56.580 --> 03:12:01.380]  me, silencing me, bankrupting me, destroying my family, maybe he thinks he can get me to
[03:12:01.380 --> 03:12:05.780]  flip on the president, that is not going to happen.
[03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:11.980]  So I'd rather fight, I will fight, I will mount a vigorous defense of any bogus charge
[03:12:11.980 --> 03:12:19.020]  they try to cook up in regards to my personal life or my business life or my political activities,
[03:12:19.020 --> 03:12:22.980]  but I've been targeted, there's no question, and this is going to cost me a fortune, which
[03:12:22.980 --> 03:12:29.060]  is why I ask up my friends and supporters, go to StoneDefenseFundit.com.
[03:12:29.060 --> 03:12:34.780]  Very soon we will be unveiling the InfoWars Legal Defense Fund because you're facing
[03:12:34.780 --> 03:12:40.860]  the same kind of BS lawsuits, harassment lawsuits that are being used to malign you,
[03:12:40.860 --> 03:12:45.540]  to smear you, to drive you into bankruptcy because they're expensive even though they're
[03:12:45.540 --> 03:12:50.940]  harassment oriented and frivolous, and we're just not going to stand for it, we are going
[03:12:50.940 --> 03:12:51.940]  to fight.
[03:12:51.940 --> 03:12:55.220]  Well, I've talked to the lawyers and the experts and they totally agree that these are all
[03:12:55.220 --> 03:12:59.740]  lawfare deals, but with enough of them, it can start to have the desired effect, that's
[03:12:59.740 --> 03:13:00.740]  what listeners understand.
[03:13:00.740 --> 03:13:04.300]  We're not just saying this, we're up against the Clinton Crime Network.
[03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:09.260]  People asked us to fight them, I fought them, I'm not complaining, I'm not bitching, but
[03:13:09.260 --> 03:13:14.340]  if you want your champions to continue on, they need to see millions and millions.
[03:13:14.340 --> 03:13:19.900]  Millions of dollars weren't what they used to be, okay, satellites, crew, people, legal,
[03:13:19.900 --> 03:13:24.140]  there's more than 12 active lawsuits against us right now.
[03:13:24.140 --> 03:13:29.900]  As fast as we knock them down, they put new ones in, but by the grace of God, wine seeds
[03:13:29.900 --> 03:13:36.100]  go into jail, he's part of the larger network of pedophiles we know through the Alita Express.
[03:13:36.100 --> 03:13:39.620]  This is going to bring them all down, it's why they're fighting for their lives because
[03:13:39.620 --> 03:13:41.580]  it's a death battle, Roger.
[03:13:41.580 --> 03:13:45.300]  So yes, we need to have a big focus fundraiser next week because I've learned, I just kind
[03:13:45.300 --> 03:13:47.000]  of ask here, ask there, it doesn't do anything.
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:51.980]  We'd have a big beat the drum, lay it out, expose it, extravaganza, so get your butt
[03:13:51.980 --> 03:13:55.020]  to Texas as soon as you can to launch this thing next Thursday.
[03:13:55.020 --> 03:13:59.100]  We're doing a 34 hour broadcast, if none of your wife's from the hospital, we'll do it
[03:13:59.100 --> 03:14:00.100]  remote, my friend.
[03:14:00.100 --> 03:14:02.100]  I'll destroy your comments.
[03:14:02.100 --> 03:14:07.180]  Well, and I think that if they saw the audience support us even more in the face of these
[03:14:07.180 --> 03:14:12.860]  lawsuits, they'd be less inclined to actually go with them because it's all measurements
[03:14:12.860 --> 03:14:13.860]  with them.
[03:14:13.860 --> 03:14:16.780]  It's all measuring how they can bring you down or getting your head or whatever.
[03:14:16.780 --> 03:14:19.980]  It's like Caputo, he was going to have to sell his house and as soon as he got the support,
[03:14:19.980 --> 03:14:20.980]  they kind of backed off.
[03:14:20.980 --> 03:14:21.980]  Exactly.
[03:14:21.980 --> 03:14:25.500]  So if they saw that all of a sudden in the face of these lawsuits that Info Wars just
[03:14:25.500 --> 03:14:32.340]  got massive amounts of purchases at InfoWarsStore.com, record purchases at InfoWarsStore.com as
[03:14:32.340 --> 03:14:35.220]  they continued about in these lawsuits, I think that that might back them off because
[03:14:35.220 --> 03:14:39.400]  now they're realizing that, uh-oh, we're actually making Info Wars bigger by attacking them
[03:14:39.400 --> 03:14:40.400]  like this.
[03:14:40.400 --> 03:14:41.400]  The Streisand effect is real.
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:42.400]  Exactly.
[03:14:42.400 --> 03:14:45.100]  Imagine if you had a chance to go back and be in the second American Revolution.
[03:14:45.100 --> 03:14:46.100]  This is it.
[03:14:46.100 --> 03:14:47.100]  We're delivering.
[03:14:47.100 --> 03:14:48.100]  It's happening.
[03:14:48.100 --> 03:14:49.100]  The enemy knows.
[03:14:49.100 --> 03:14:53.700]  And they're trying to destroy us, so InfoWarsStore.com, get Roger Stone's new book, their Stone's

[03:15:06.180 --> 03:15:08.340]  You'll be back next week as well.
[03:15:08.340 --> 03:15:10.180]  Thank you so much, Roger, and Godspeed.
[03:15:10.180 --> 03:15:13.980]  Well, people ask me how I feel, whether I'm concerned.
[03:15:13.980 --> 03:15:18.060]  I've seen this attack on you and smearing you on the Sandy Hook matter.
[03:15:18.060 --> 03:15:20.380]  That really, really aggravates me.
[03:15:20.380 --> 03:15:23.660]  We're in this together and we're not going to stop fighting.
[03:15:23.660 --> 03:15:25.380]  We will not be silenced.
[03:15:25.380 --> 03:15:29.020]  We will not be knee capped.
[03:15:29.020 --> 03:15:30.020]  We're ready to fight.
[03:15:30.020 --> 03:15:34.180]  But we can't do it without the help of the InfoWars audience.
[03:15:34.180 --> 03:15:36.340]  I mean, they're like the blood in our arteries.
[03:15:36.340 --> 03:15:40.020]  When they give, when they spread the word, they overpower the sensors, they financially
[03:15:40.020 --> 03:15:41.020]  defeat the enemy.
[03:15:41.020 --> 03:15:42.020]  We are our listeners.
[03:15:42.020 --> 03:15:43.020]  We are our supporters.
[03:15:43.020 --> 03:15:46.020]  So yes, take advantage of the record sales at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:15:46.020 --> 03:15:50.500]  All right, Owen, get ready because you're going to be hosting the Special Veterans War
[03:15:50.500 --> 03:15:52.660]  Room with Sawman coming up.
[03:15:52.660 --> 03:15:53.660]  But first, Joel Gilbert.

[03:16:00.020 --> 03:16:04.100]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow
[03:16:04.100 --> 03:16:05.100]  government ever.
[03:16:05.100 --> 03:16:10.780]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.780 --> 03:16:13.900]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people

[03:20:29.980 --> 03:20:33.580]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from the left coast.
[03:20:33.580 --> 03:20:39.660]  Don't forget to check out my new film in the Alex Jones Store, Art of the Insult, Trump
[03:20:39.660 --> 03:20:41.540]  the Art of the Insult.
[03:20:41.540 --> 03:20:43.820]  We're going to be taking calls later today.
[03:20:43.820 --> 03:20:45.060]  You might want to start dialing.
[03:20:45.060 --> 03:20:50.980]  It's going to be a very famous guest, Hollywood icon, writer and director Lionel Chetwin coming
[03:20:50.980 --> 03:20:52.100]  up in a few minutes.
[03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:57.180]  We're going to talk about Harvey Weinstein and the liberal bias in Hollywood, what it's
[03:20:57.180 --> 03:21:02.620]  all about from the iconic director who's been telling stories of freedom and the American
[03:21:02.620 --> 03:21:06.780]  way for many, many years right in the heart of liberal Hollywood.
[03:21:06.780 --> 03:21:16.940]  The phone number is going to be 1-877-789-2539.
[03:21:16.940 --> 03:21:22.460]  Before we bring up Lionel Chetwin, I want to talk about what is now known as Spy Gate.
[03:21:22.460 --> 03:21:27.940]  All this time, we find out after all this time that the Department of Justice, the FBI,
[03:21:27.940 --> 03:21:35.660]  CIA orchestrated an effort to steal the election for Obama's party, the radical Socialist Democrats,
[03:21:35.660 --> 03:21:40.740]  and keep Hillary in office so that Obama's fundamental transformation of America could
[03:21:40.740 --> 03:21:41.740]  be complete.
[03:21:41.740 --> 03:21:47.180]  Now, what people are not talking about is that Spy Gate is nothing new.
[03:21:47.180 --> 03:21:51.100]  People forget that Obama did it back in 2012.
[03:21:51.100 --> 03:21:55.340]  He stole the election using government agencies, using the IRS.
[03:21:55.340 --> 03:22:01.020]  Let's take a quick look at the video of Obama talking about IRS interference and let's see
[03:22:01.020 --> 03:22:02.260]  if we can see if he's lying.
[03:22:02.260 --> 03:22:04.500]  Let's take a look.
[03:22:04.500 --> 03:22:14.180]  If in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and
[03:22:14.180 --> 03:22:19.860]  were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that's outrageous.
[03:22:19.860 --> 03:22:22.500]  They have to be held fully accountable.
[03:22:22.500 --> 03:22:32.100]  You don't want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased and anything less than neutral
[03:22:32.100 --> 03:22:33.620]  in terms of how they operate.
[03:22:33.620 --> 03:22:38.460]  But I will not tolerate it and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened
[03:22:38.460 --> 03:22:39.460]  on this.
[03:22:39.460 --> 03:22:40.460]  Okay.
[03:22:40.460 --> 03:22:44.140]  So, gee, do you think maybe Obama is lying through his teeth and he knew about it?
[03:22:44.140 --> 03:22:52.140]  The IRS, head of the IRS visited the White House 500 times, Lois Lerner pleads the fifth.
[03:22:52.140 --> 03:22:57.220]  So this has been going on for years, and this is the way that Obama operated his police
[03:22:57.220 --> 03:22:58.380]  state.
[03:22:58.380 --> 03:23:03.220]  It wasn't that five guys at the FBI and my old high school friend Bruce Orr that I went
[03:23:03.220 --> 03:23:07.180]  to high school with, they didn't wake up and say, hey, let's commit a bunch of felonies
[03:23:07.180 --> 03:23:10.820]  and treason and we'll try to get Hillary elected.
[03:23:10.820 --> 03:23:13.440]  This was years of police state activity.
[03:23:13.440 --> 03:23:18.620]  It was a natural thing for Obama, fast and furious, spying on the Associated Press, spying
[03:23:18.620 --> 03:23:25.340]  on Fox News, James Rosen, John Brennan, the CIA, spying on the Senate committee, intelligence
[03:23:25.340 --> 03:23:26.580]  committee.
[03:23:26.580 --> 03:23:34.500]  So people remember that, look, after two years of Obama from 2008 to 2010, the public knew
[03:23:34.500 --> 03:23:35.700]  they'd been had.
[03:23:35.700 --> 03:23:38.180]  This guy was not who he says he was.
[03:23:38.180 --> 03:23:41.220]  His agenda was not what he said it would be.
[03:23:41.220 --> 03:23:43.500]  He was not going to cut the deficit in half.
[03:23:43.500 --> 03:23:47.580]  It was not the most transparent government in history.
[03:23:47.580 --> 03:23:54.380]  They could see he was pro-Russia, pro-Iranian, pro-Muslim extremist groups.
[03:23:54.380 --> 03:23:56.620]  So the Tea Party movement arose across the country.
[03:23:56.620 --> 03:24:00.300]  They swept the Democrats out of power in 2010.
[03:24:00.300 --> 03:24:04.660]  And they were poised to easily remove Obama in 2012 to get rid of him.
[03:24:04.660 --> 03:24:08.300]  The public knew he had lied about everything.
[03:24:08.300 --> 03:24:10.020]  So Obama used the police state.
[03:24:10.020 --> 03:24:13.800]  He used the IRS to crush the conservative Tea Party movement.
[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:18.300]  They couldn't organize for the 2012 election while the left was allowed to organize.
[03:24:18.300 --> 03:24:20.860]  And that's all we actually even know about.
[03:24:20.860 --> 03:24:24.500]  So by comparison, let me tell you what a police state is.
[03:24:24.500 --> 03:24:28.180]  I experienced it when I visited Russia in 1983.
[03:24:28.180 --> 03:24:30.020]  This was the height of the Cold War.
[03:24:30.020 --> 03:24:35.100]  Andropov was the former head of the KGB, was president of the Soviet Union.
[03:24:35.100 --> 03:24:36.500]  And I went on a tour of Russia.
[03:24:36.500 --> 03:24:39.980]  And I also visited families who were trying to leave Russia.
[03:24:39.980 --> 03:24:44.180]  And the first thing you notice when you get into Soviet communist Russia is it's like
[03:24:44.180 --> 03:24:45.180]  backwards world.
[03:24:45.180 --> 03:24:46.700]  There's no food.
[03:24:46.700 --> 03:24:48.460]  Even if you have money, there's nothing to buy.
[03:24:48.460 --> 03:24:50.420]  The stores are empty.
[03:24:50.420 --> 03:24:54.220]  There's only one model of a car with four different colors.
[03:24:54.220 --> 03:24:58.660]  And it's like a horror movie from 1984, you know, Orwell.
[03:24:58.660 --> 03:24:59.740]  And everything is opposite.
[03:24:59.740 --> 03:25:03.060]  The Russian media says everything the opposite of the truth.
[03:25:03.060 --> 03:25:04.060]  Communism is great.
[03:25:04.060 --> 03:25:06.060]  Free markets are bad.
[03:25:06.060 --> 03:25:08.060]  America is oppressive.
[03:25:08.060 --> 03:25:10.180]  Americans are starving to death.
[03:25:10.180 --> 03:25:14.740]  So the Russian media and the communist officials, all they did was lie.
[03:25:14.740 --> 03:25:20.300]  Now this kind of reminds you of the mainstream media today, Adam Schiff, Chuck Schumer.
[03:25:20.300 --> 03:25:22.780]  When they moved their lips, they're lying.
[03:25:22.780 --> 03:25:24.100]  Now what happened to me in Russia?
[03:25:24.100 --> 03:25:28.220]  When I arrived at the airport, I got held for 12 hours and questioned all night long
[03:25:28.220 --> 03:25:30.300]  because I was an American.
[03:25:30.300 --> 03:25:36.420]  I was followed around by, I don't know who, Militia as I walked around Moscow, Leningrad
[03:25:36.420 --> 03:25:38.220]  as I visited different families.
[03:25:38.220 --> 03:25:42.620]  When I took a taxi, two guys followed in a red car.
[03:25:42.620 --> 03:25:45.140]  And I was visiting someone who was arrested.
[03:25:45.140 --> 03:25:47.540]  Now this was the police state.
[03:25:47.540 --> 03:25:49.740]  Now what happened to me in 2012?
[03:25:49.740 --> 03:25:50.740]  Can you believe it's America?
[03:25:50.740 --> 03:25:56.900]  I flew into Washington DC for CPAC and I was told not to get off the plane by the co-pilot.
[03:25:56.900 --> 03:25:59.140]  Four police officers come and escort me off the plane.
[03:25:59.140 --> 03:26:03.300]  They asked me about my films that I've produced and I kind of just laughed and they eventually
[03:26:03.300 --> 03:26:04.740]  let me go.
[03:26:04.740 --> 03:26:11.500]  The next time I'm in DC, the Capitol Police follow me when I leave my hotel, the car and
[03:26:11.500 --> 03:26:14.540]  pull me over, check my ID and let me go.
[03:26:14.540 --> 03:26:19.860]  The IRS opens a five-year-old tax returns and denies all my business expenses.
[03:26:19.860 --> 03:26:23.940]  A leftist reporter working for George Soros hacks my bank account.
[03:26:23.940 --> 03:26:31.420]  So people that have been opposing Obama and revealing the truth, Dinesh D'Souza, others,
[03:26:31.420 --> 03:26:37.900]  we've experienced the police state, not too much different from my 1983 visit to the Soviet
[03:26:37.900 --> 03:26:38.900]  Union.
[03:26:38.900 --> 03:26:44.060]  Does anybody really believe that if Hillary had been elected, 10,000 votes in a couple
[03:26:44.060 --> 03:26:48.660]  of swing states, that there would ever be another free election?
[03:26:48.660 --> 03:26:51.660]  Now in a police state, if you go along with the program, you don't have a problem.
[03:26:51.660 --> 03:26:53.060]  No problem.
[03:26:53.060 --> 03:26:59.340]  But if you oppose socialism, if you say this isn't working out, the economy is crashing,
[03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:03.340]  all the inner cities are getting worse, if you point out their hypocrisy, the police
[03:27:03.340 --> 03:27:05.300]  state comes after you.
[03:27:05.300 --> 03:27:09.700]  So we're seeing the last vestiges of the police state.
[03:27:09.700 --> 03:27:16.860]  Obama did everything he could to stay in power in 2012, and he used the entire tools of state,
[03:27:16.860 --> 03:27:23.340]  FBI, DOJ, and they're still not finished with this special counsel.
[03:27:23.340 --> 03:27:27.380]  And their goal is to restore the Democrat police state, because Democrat and liberal
[03:27:27.380 --> 03:27:29.460]  policies don't work.
[03:27:29.460 --> 03:27:31.140]  Socialism does not work.
[03:27:31.140 --> 03:27:37.740]  The only way they can maintain power in history is to use force, whether it's the government
[03:27:37.740 --> 03:27:44.500]  agencies, the gulag, the actual police to haul you off of airplanes.
[03:27:44.500 --> 03:27:50.340]  And I don't know that anyone completely understands, and everyone should understand, how close the
[03:27:50.340 --> 03:27:55.220]  United States as a republic, as a constitutional government, came to coming to a permanent
[03:27:55.220 --> 03:27:56.220]  end.
[03:27:56.220 --> 03:28:01.780]  And that's why myself, Infowars Alex Jones, people like Jerome Corsi, of course, Roger
[03:28:01.780 --> 03:28:07.980]  Brown, so many others, we fought so hard to bring information to the public and show what
[03:28:07.980 --> 03:28:11.220]  the Obama police state was really all about.
[03:28:11.220 --> 03:28:13.020]  My film dreams my real father.
[03:28:13.020 --> 03:28:18.780]  I demonstrated that Obama's real father was a Soviet agent, and that Obama was radicalized
[03:28:18.780 --> 03:28:26.020]  into this Marxist worldview that held that Americans are deplorable, and they must be
[03:28:26.020 --> 03:28:30.300]  controlled and guided for socialism.
[03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:35.860]  Coming up, iconic Hollywood director and writer Lionel Chetwind is going to reveal what's
[03:28:35.860 --> 03:28:43.020]  really been going on in Hollywood and how the bias in Hollywood is affecting free speech.
[03:28:43.020 --> 03:28:53.420]  Coming up right after the break with Lionel Chetwind.
[03:28:53.420 --> 03:28:54.420]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:28:54.420 --> 03:28:56.700]  A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:28:56.700 --> 03:29:00.780]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other
[03:29:00.780 --> 03:29:04.820]  endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[03:29:04.820 --> 03:29:06.780]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[03:29:23.580 --> 03:29:27.620]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[03:29:27.620 --> 03:29:31.700]  keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare
[03:29:31.700 --> 03:29:34.340]  system has become a challenge.

[03:30:48.820 --> 03:30:49.820]  the word.
[03:30:49.820 --> 03:30:53.900]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:30:53.900 --> 03:30:56.660]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[03:30:56.660 --> 03:30:59.220]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[03:30:59.220 --> 03:31:02.860]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[03:31:02.860 --> 03:31:09.100]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:31:09.100 --> 03:31:15.100]  And as a longtime info wars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[03:31:15.100 --> 03:31:16.100]  Anthroplex.
[03:31:16.100 --> 03:31:18.380]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[03:31:18.380 --> 03:31:19.380]  Thank you.
[03:31:19.380 --> 03:31:23.420]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[03:31:23.420 --> 03:31:24.420]  toothpaste fans.
[03:31:24.420 --> 03:31:29.180]  The super blue is awesome, and thank you so much, Alex, for the info wars life products.
[03:31:29.180 --> 03:31:30.380]  They are quality.
[03:31:30.380 --> 03:31:35.060]  I can't wait to get some more, and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:31:35.060 --> 03:31:36.060]  Absolutely.
[03:31:36.060 --> 03:31:41.340]  And because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[03:31:41.340 --> 03:31:45.660]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in
[03:31:45.660 --> 03:31:54.380]  order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:31:54.380 --> 03:31:55.380]  I'm so excited.
[03:31:55.380 --> 03:32:00.820]  The new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to
[03:32:00.820 --> 03:32:05.500]  the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red bill.
[03:32:05.500 --> 03:32:10.980]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[03:32:10.980 --> 03:32:13.900]  boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:32:13.900 --> 03:32:20.260]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[03:32:20.260 --> 03:32:26.540]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[03:32:26.540 --> 03:32:30.180]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:32:30.180 --> 03:32:37.260]  One GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[03:32:37.260 --> 03:32:42.700]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[03:32:42.700 --> 03:32:44.380]  hormones in your glands.
[03:32:44.380 --> 03:32:47.180]  It is amazing.
[03:32:47.180 --> 03:32:57.060]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:32:57.060 --> 03:33:10.900]  Or listening to the Alex Jones show.

[03:33:27.460 --> 03:33:28.700]  coast.
[03:33:28.700 --> 03:33:32.500]  You know me from my recent film, of course, is Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:33:32.500 --> 03:33:37.700]  Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones store, support infowars, and get this great new film.
[03:33:37.700 --> 03:33:41.380]  I'm going to be taking some calls shortly for my guest.

[03:33:55.700 --> 03:34:02.300]  He's known for such films as Miracle on Ice, Hanoi Hilton, Ruby Ridge, Kissinger Nixon.
[03:34:02.300 --> 03:34:03.820]  So many more films.
[03:34:03.820 --> 03:34:08.100]  He was one of the founders of the Hollywood conservative group, Friends of Abe.
[03:34:08.100 --> 03:34:12.820]  Let's take a quick look at some movie clips to remind you of Lionel's films.
[03:34:12.820 --> 03:34:21.820]  There were 20 of them, they didn't know how they were going to do it, but they knew they
[03:34:21.820 --> 03:34:40.260]  wanted to win.
[03:34:40.260 --> 03:34:45.620]  Just a few of the films from Lionel Chatwin joining us now from the Hollywood Hills, Lionel,
[03:34:45.620 --> 03:34:46.620]  welcome to Infowars.
[03:34:46.620 --> 03:34:49.780]  I'm very happy to be here, thanks for having me, Joel.
[03:34:49.780 --> 03:34:56.740]  Okay, well, before we get into the Hollywood left liberal bias and everything going on
[03:34:56.740 --> 03:35:02.660]  in Hollywood, today Harvey Weinstein was finally brought into court.
[03:35:02.660 --> 03:35:05.700]  Can you give us some perspective of being in Hollywood all this time?
[03:35:05.700 --> 03:35:11.420]  Does the Me Too movement have it right or is there more to this scenario than people
[03:35:11.420 --> 03:35:12.420]  really understand?
[03:35:12.420 --> 03:35:17.300]  Well, you know, Hollywood, the entertainment business generally, has always been something
[03:35:17.300 --> 03:35:23.500]  of a twilight in terms of morality, in terms of the way people interact, is just in the
[03:35:23.500 --> 03:35:26.140]  nature of the beast.
[03:35:26.140 --> 03:35:33.380]  And clearly there is abuse, abuse of attitudes of people towards one another.
[03:35:33.380 --> 03:35:37.860]  But it has less to do with gender than what would be led to believe.
[03:35:37.860 --> 03:35:42.420]  When in the very beginning of my career, most of the people for whom I worked were men.
[03:35:42.420 --> 03:35:46.620]  Development executives and development was largely a male preserve.
[03:35:46.620 --> 03:35:51.340]  By the 1990s, it was almost universally women.
[03:35:51.340 --> 03:35:55.620]  And I mean, there are all kinds of stories at two levels.
[03:35:55.620 --> 03:36:02.380]  One are women in power who exploited that power to enhance their entertainment, however you
[03:36:02.380 --> 03:36:03.900]  would like to say that.
[03:36:03.900 --> 03:36:10.820]  And so the abusive behavior in Hollywood is not only a function of gender, it's really
[03:36:10.820 --> 03:36:12.300]  a function of power.
[03:36:12.300 --> 03:36:20.740]  And those who are in power will tend to exploit that power for their own pleasure, enjoyment
[03:36:20.740 --> 03:36:21.740]  or whatever.
[03:36:21.740 --> 03:36:30.220]  The other thing is, you'll hear this from people who have one person in particular had
[03:36:30.220 --> 03:36:32.900]  a hilarious story, they weren't hilarious actually.
[03:36:32.900 --> 03:36:37.580]  But during the casting sessions for programs, women, young women, particularly the shows
[03:36:37.580 --> 03:36:43.900]  that were headed or aimed at a younger audience, they'd come into audition and they'd do what's
[03:36:43.900 --> 03:36:45.460]  called the Sharon Stone.
[03:36:45.460 --> 03:36:54.860]  They'd plush, sending a clear message of availability should the right thing turn out.
[03:36:54.860 --> 03:36:56.740]  So the central abuse is real.
[03:36:56.740 --> 03:37:00.180]  It's dehumanizing, it's unpleasant.
[03:37:00.180 --> 03:37:05.740]  I know many men, including myself when I was younger, looked a little better and was in
[03:37:05.740 --> 03:37:10.220]  better shape, I suppose, who have experienced it on the other side.
[03:37:10.220 --> 03:37:13.220]  So it's endemic.
[03:37:13.220 --> 03:37:17.180]  I'm glad they're catching up to thugs like Harvey Weinstein because Harvey is a thug,
[03:37:17.180 --> 03:37:18.780]  was a thug and everyone knew he was a thug.
[03:37:18.780 --> 03:37:25.940]  The only person who ever stood up to him actually was Matt Pitt, who confronted him at an Emmy
[03:37:25.940 --> 03:37:31.660]  party and threatened to bust his jaw if he ever did a certain thing again.
[03:37:31.660 --> 03:37:36.980]  But he's the only one I know that ever really stood up, so I'm glad they're cleaning out
[03:37:36.980 --> 03:37:37.980]  the male thugs.
[03:37:37.980 --> 03:37:45.860]  I hope they'll extend it to all of the thugs, whatever their sexual orientation of choice
[03:37:45.860 --> 03:37:47.660]  is on a particular day.
[03:37:47.660 --> 03:37:56.940]  Okay, well, you're known as a filmmaker who's told these great American stories of freedom,
[03:37:56.940 --> 03:38:02.220]  trying to explain the stories of American heroism and courage and American values for
[03:38:02.220 --> 03:38:03.220]  many years.
[03:38:03.220 --> 03:38:08.700]  What have you been up against in Hollywood in the past, in your career, and has it gotten
[03:38:08.700 --> 03:38:09.700]  worse?
[03:38:09.700 --> 03:38:16.140]  Are these stories true that liberals on the left don't want to hear conservatives' points
[03:38:16.140 --> 03:38:19.420]  of view or conservative films, even if it would make them a ton of money?
[03:38:19.420 --> 03:38:20.420]  Can you give us the background?
[03:38:20.420 --> 03:38:25.420]  Yeah, I think there are various reasons why the liberal point of view was prevailed in
[03:38:25.420 --> 03:38:34.340]  spite of the fact it was really counterintuitive in terms of the economic interest in the studios.
[03:38:34.340 --> 03:38:42.580]  The problem today are the streaming services, Netflix and Amazon, Hulu and some of the newer
[03:38:42.580 --> 03:38:45.140]  channel stars and so on and so forth.
[03:38:45.140 --> 03:38:47.620]  They're concerned with their business, not ratings.
[03:38:47.620 --> 03:38:50.260]  Ratings no longer kind of generate in that world.
[03:38:50.260 --> 03:38:53.980]  It's what they call churn and churn is a number of people, the difference between the
[03:38:53.980 --> 03:38:57.380]  number of people who sign on in a month and the number of people that don't sign on and
[03:38:57.380 --> 03:39:00.740]  if you've got more people signing on than quitting, then you have a positive churn if
[03:39:00.740 --> 03:39:02.180]  more quit them.
[03:39:02.180 --> 03:39:08.980]  And so they feel the best way to improve their churn is to win awards.
[03:39:08.980 --> 03:39:15.780]  So the objective of much of the programming on Netflix showtime and all of these outlets
[03:39:15.780 --> 03:39:22.020]  is to win an Emmy or if they could get a qualifying release to win an Oscar or to be nominated
[03:39:22.020 --> 03:39:25.980]  or to get that kind of publicity during award season, they feel that will attract people.
[03:39:25.980 --> 03:39:32.060]  But of course, the only way you can get those awards is by catering to that very small audience.
[03:39:32.060 --> 03:39:39.860]  The Academy, when I've been in the Academy for a very long time, my first produced film,
[03:39:39.860 --> 03:39:42.860]  The Apprenticeship of Denny Kravitz, I got an Oscar nomination, so I've been a member
[03:39:42.860 --> 03:39:43.860]  ever since.
[03:39:43.860 --> 03:39:50.380]  But the Academy two years ago, after the Oscars So White campaign, the Board of Governors
[03:39:50.380 --> 03:39:54.220]  simply decided there was no debate, there was no vote, there was no notice because one
[03:39:54.220 --> 03:40:00.940]  day in the email comes a notice, we have decided that all people over a certain age can no
[03:40:00.940 --> 03:40:07.220]  longer vote, anyone who's not had a credit in 10 years or a significant role in 10 years
[03:40:07.220 --> 03:40:13.740]  is out of the organization in terms of voting, and we will create a new group of voting associate
[03:40:13.740 --> 03:40:14.740]  members.
[03:40:14.740 --> 03:40:21.260]  The first three were women, all three were hijabs, one had never made a film, as I recall,
[03:40:21.260 --> 03:40:24.500]  but said that she wanted to be a filmmaker and being a member of the Academy would no
[03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:25.500]  doubt help.
[03:40:25.500 --> 03:40:30.620]  I'm not sure about that, but you know, so it was done by Fiat.
[03:40:30.620 --> 03:40:39.820]  So the control of what is measured as success by the members of the industry very much drives
[03:40:39.820 --> 03:40:49.980]  the new end users, the new end users, and that's very left wing, and in that sense it's
[03:40:49.980 --> 03:40:50.980]  much worse.
[03:40:50.980 --> 03:41:00.140]  Now in the 80s, I was actually openly backlisted by HBO, the head of production there told
[03:41:00.140 --> 03:41:05.540]  me that I was on the lot at what was then Laura Moore, and so three Laura Moore producers
[03:41:05.540 --> 03:41:09.660]  independently went in and talked about having me do something, and they said, oh no, he's
[03:41:09.660 --> 03:41:16.380]  a conservative, and therefore he cannot write caring women or gay men, or gay women and
[03:41:16.380 --> 03:41:19.980]  caring women, it was one or the other, I'm not quite sure, and they're very open about
[03:41:19.980 --> 03:41:25.580]  it, that I was a conservative as far as they were concerned, that disqualified me from
[03:41:25.580 --> 03:41:29.660]  being employed by HBO.
[03:41:29.660 --> 03:41:33.620]  I confronted them on this, they became very concerned until I told them, don't worry,
[03:41:33.620 --> 03:41:38.420]  I'm not doing you, I'm a conservative, we don't have any tort lawyers, they failed to
[03:41:38.420 --> 03:41:45.340]  see the humor in that, but eventually of course they did hire me again, and I got some awards
[03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:50.860]  for them, so I guess they thought it was okay, but now there's no open black listing of that
[03:41:50.860 --> 03:41:58.820]  sort, but there is a very stiff white listing process that goes on, which is much more
[03:41:58.820 --> 03:42:04.660]  insidious, and much more dangerous, much more anti-democratic, no black list, it's a black
[03:42:04.660 --> 03:42:09.940]  list you can confront, you can do what I did, insist that they meet with me and just confront
[03:42:09.940 --> 03:42:16.100]  them and embarrass them, it was a lot of fun, one of my better days at the entertainment
[03:42:16.100 --> 03:42:21.420]  business, but you can't do that with a white list, you see, a white list is really a list
[03:42:21.420 --> 03:42:27.220]  of who's employable, as opposed to who's not employable, you know, no one could claim-
[03:42:27.220 --> 03:42:31.900]  we're going to come back in a couple minutes, we've got another segment, we'll take some
[03:42:31.900 --> 03:42:37.740]  phone calls with Lionel Chetwin, from the Hollywood Hills you can call in at 877-8789

[03:45:03.180 --> 03:45:04.700]  to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.700 --> 03:45:09.580]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[03:45:24.660 --> 03:45:29.300]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly

[03:45:53.860 --> 03:45:59.460]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending
[03:45:59.460 --> 03:46:01.540]  down over the UK.
[03:46:01.540 --> 03:46:07.220]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get
[03:46:07.220 --> 03:46:09.400]  six months in prison.
[03:46:09.400 --> 03:46:13.180]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[03:46:13.180 --> 03:46:17.940]  CNN and many others are calling for infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:46:17.940 --> 03:46:22.860]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young
[03:46:22.860 --> 03:46:28.380]  people against the infowars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually
[03:46:28.380 --> 03:46:29.820]  hear what we have to say.
[03:46:29.820 --> 03:46:32.740]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[03:46:32.740 --> 03:46:39.180]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com and sign up for the free newsletter so we
[03:46:39.180 --> 03:46:44.660]  can be in contact with you and so the censors can bully their way in and block us being
[03:46:44.660 --> 03:46:49.860]  able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society that is critical to this fight.
[03:46:49.860 --> 03:47:17.060]  He will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[03:47:17.060 --> 03:47:23.900]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Joel Gilbert here with you from Los Angeles.
[03:47:23.900 --> 03:47:31.700]  We're going to continue with my guest, iconic conservative and American storyteller, writer
[03:47:31.700 --> 03:47:34.140]  and film director Lionel Chetwind.
[03:47:34.140 --> 03:47:38.980]  You know him from such famous films as Miracle on Ice, Hanoi Hilton, Ruby Ridge, so many
[03:47:38.980 --> 03:47:39.980]  more.
[03:47:39.980 --> 03:47:41.980]  We're going to continue with Lionel.
[03:47:41.980 --> 03:47:47.220]  Lionel, what would happen today if a lighting director would show up at a Hollywood studio
[03:47:47.220 --> 03:47:56.740]  wearing a Trump Make America Great Again hat and why do they hate Donald Trump so much?
[03:47:56.740 --> 03:48:00.780]  Oh my.
[03:48:00.780 --> 03:48:01.780]  That's a complicated question.
[03:48:01.780 --> 03:48:06.220]  First of all, someone showed up at a MAGA hat, probably wouldn't get by security or,
[03:48:06.220 --> 03:48:14.980]  I mean, that would be, it would not, no, I can't answer the question because it's almost
[03:48:14.980 --> 03:48:18.460]  beyond my imagination that anyone would do anything like that, I mean, would just be
[03:48:18.460 --> 03:48:22.100]  so obviously in their face.
[03:48:22.100 --> 03:48:23.100]  Why do they hate Trump?
[03:48:23.100 --> 03:48:24.940]  They hate Trump for a lot of reasons.
[03:48:24.940 --> 03:48:30.980]  Number one, it's interesting that most of the sins of which they accuse him are their
[03:48:30.980 --> 03:48:33.860]  own sins.
[03:48:33.860 --> 03:48:37.940]  They say he's harsh on women, yeah, he's harsh on women.
[03:48:37.940 --> 03:48:40.420]  He speaks in a vulgar fashion.
[03:48:40.420 --> 03:48:45.860]  The most vulgar language I've ever heard is very frequently at pitch meetings or with
[03:48:45.860 --> 03:48:53.460]  executives, writers' tables, and there's no distinction between men and women when it
[03:48:53.460 --> 03:48:55.620]  comes to the use of the vulgar language.
[03:48:55.620 --> 03:49:00.300]  So I think they hate him because of his success, in spite of being everything they pretend
[03:49:00.300 --> 03:49:01.860]  not to be, but in fact are.
[03:49:01.860 --> 03:49:11.140]  It is very convoluted, but if you follow me, that's, I mean, you know, also he threatens,
[03:49:11.140 --> 03:49:12.140]  he's very threatening.
[03:49:12.140 --> 03:49:19.220]  They're part of an elite who exerts so much control over our daily lives in a subliminal
[03:49:19.220 --> 03:49:26.500]  way, in a very invidious way, in a way that George Orwell would have admired, and he's
[03:49:26.500 --> 03:49:28.700]  a disruptor.
[03:49:28.700 --> 03:49:33.060]  Not really a disruptor, and this is my argument with them, he's not really the disruptor.
[03:49:33.060 --> 03:49:38.340]  The disruption has been the incursion of the left into our daily life and what they call
[03:49:38.340 --> 03:49:41.740]  progressive, which was the old word for communist, and there's a better description for what
[03:49:41.740 --> 03:49:43.940]  most of them really are, whether they know it or not.
[03:49:43.940 --> 03:49:54.300]  I mean, the communist in the sense of an all-powerful state, and he is disrupting their disruption.
[03:49:54.300 --> 03:50:00.780]  And that's, you know, really disturbing because a career in a place like Hollywood is very
[03:50:00.780 --> 03:50:01.780]  fragile.
[03:50:01.780 --> 03:50:08.540]  I mean, look, if you could bring down Harvey Weinstein in half an hour, no one can imagine
[03:50:08.540 --> 03:50:14.740]  how powerfully he once was, that's just an example of the fragility of a success in Hollywood.
[03:50:14.740 --> 03:50:21.620]  And so a disruptor is terribly dangerous and threatening to each of them on an individual
[03:50:21.620 --> 03:50:25.540]  basis, and of course to the community as well.
[03:50:25.540 --> 03:50:27.380]  Can you tell the story?
[03:50:27.380 --> 03:50:33.380]  I know you had a recent experience with your entertainment attorney for many, many years,
[03:50:33.380 --> 03:50:39.340]  how they treated you, even though you were a client for forever.
[03:50:39.340 --> 03:50:44.100]  Yeah, well, my lawyer, interesting, was actually a conservative.
[03:50:44.100 --> 03:50:51.500]  My lawyer for over 35 years, I had really done him more favors than he had done me,
[03:50:51.500 --> 03:50:57.460]  because I was the only person actually openly supporting George W. Bush in both of his election
[03:50:57.460 --> 03:50:58.460]  campaigns.
[03:50:58.460 --> 03:51:05.500]  I was sort of his go-to guy in Hollywood, and I arranged for George W. Bush to attend
[03:51:05.500 --> 03:51:07.380]  a big gala in this guy's honor.
[03:51:07.380 --> 03:51:09.420]  I did very well by this guy.
[03:51:09.420 --> 03:51:16.500]  He got him appointed to, or brought to, Carlos' attention, his usefulness as a government,
[03:51:16.500 --> 03:51:22.820]  his ability to set up boards and so on, and I was summarily fired.
[03:51:22.820 --> 03:51:26.500]  After a discussion, we were having lunch in a small restaurant near their law office.
[03:51:26.500 --> 03:51:31.620]  They're very powerful attorneys, the most powerful in town.
[03:51:31.620 --> 03:51:36.780]  And I had defended, actually I was defending Cruz, later I defended Trump.
[03:51:36.780 --> 03:51:39.940]  And then they said, look, he took me in line, she said, I've got to let you go.
[03:51:39.940 --> 03:51:44.220]  He said, I love you, and it was like being dumped, it's not me, it's you, you know?
[03:51:44.220 --> 03:51:47.380]  I'd rather it's not you, it's me.
[03:51:47.380 --> 03:51:54.220]  But they had to let me go, he said, because the other clients and the partners were not
[03:51:54.220 --> 03:52:01.740]  comfortable having me in the family, for no other reason than I openly supported Trump.
[03:52:01.740 --> 03:52:07.220]  And the relationship of, the best thing was, then they sent me back my files, you know,
[03:52:07.220 --> 03:52:14.220]  11 boxes, and they, they then sent me the bill, they sent me the bill from the transport
[03:52:14.220 --> 03:52:15.220]  company.
[03:52:15.220 --> 03:52:19.140]  And I, I, I, I wrote it back in the mail, and then China, you know, the, they would
[03:52:19.140 --> 03:52:23.220]  send a bill to the families of the executed for the cost of the bulletin to kill their
[03:52:23.220 --> 03:52:24.220]  relative.
[03:52:24.220 --> 03:52:27.020]  I said, you fired me, you pay the bill, I've not heard from him since.
[03:52:27.020 --> 03:52:29.420]  Well, did they, did they buy you, did they buy you lunch at least?
[03:52:29.420 --> 03:52:30.420]  They pay for that lunch?
[03:52:30.420 --> 03:52:33.540]  Well, they did, but it was the worst lunch I've ever had, it was undercooked.
[03:52:33.540 --> 03:52:35.940]  I almost felt he talked to the chef.
[03:52:35.940 --> 03:52:41.460]  It was, it's an undercooked Alfredo, you know, running away.
[03:52:41.460 --> 03:52:45.220]  Let's take a call from Will in California wants to ask about the Hanoi Hilton.
[03:52:45.220 --> 03:52:48.820]  Let's go with Will in California, go ahead for Lionel Chetwin.
[03:52:48.820 --> 03:52:51.900]  Hello, Mr. Chetwin, how are you?
[03:52:51.900 --> 03:52:53.860]  I well, well, how are you?
[03:52:53.860 --> 03:52:54.860]  Great.
[03:52:54.860 --> 03:52:59.060]  I was fortunate enough to be a part of Hanoi Hilton.
[03:52:59.060 --> 03:53:04.500]  I was one of the POWs, and I just wanted to let you know that I learned so much on that
[03:53:04.500 --> 03:53:05.500]  set.
[03:53:05.500 --> 03:53:13.420]  And your, your military expertise that was around was top notch, and it's one of the
[03:53:13.420 --> 03:53:18.340]  most authentic films about the POWs of Hanoi.
[03:53:18.340 --> 03:53:26.860]  I wanted to ask one of the actors in the film, I believe Jeffrey Jones, am I correct, was
[03:53:26.860 --> 03:53:27.860]  that?
[03:53:27.860 --> 03:53:34.780]  Yes, yes, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, I'm sorry, and with Jeffrey Jones in the film, Jeffrey Jones,
[03:53:34.780 --> 03:53:40.580]  and I, I, I, I know that something happened with him and he was accused of pedophilia.
[03:53:40.580 --> 03:53:46.420]  Do you, do you know about the way it was rampant back then as opposed to now, the difference
[03:53:46.420 --> 03:53:54.300]  between if you knew anything was going on back then versus what you know now?
[03:53:54.300 --> 03:53:56.300]  Okay, thank you.
[03:53:56.300 --> 03:54:02.860]  Thank you for the call, Lionel, two, two things, do they handle sensitive cases any differently
[03:54:02.860 --> 03:54:08.980]  now and then, and my follow up question is, will, can you or someone else make a major
[03:54:08.980 --> 03:54:13.780]  film like Hanoi Hilton in the future, is it going to be too tough to get the execs to
[03:54:13.780 --> 03:54:15.780]  approve it?
[03:54:15.780 --> 03:54:24.260]  Well, I, I, no, I, I didn't know anything, I mean, Jeffrey was always very, you know,
[03:54:24.260 --> 03:54:30.420]  quiet, and he was a terrific guy, a wonderful actor for those who don't know, can't place
[03:54:30.420 --> 03:54:34.540]  immediately, he was the principal and Ferris Bueh was day off as well as playing a senior
[03:54:34.540 --> 03:54:36.540]  officer in Hanoi Hilton.
[03:54:36.540 --> 03:54:37.540]  Could you make the Hanoi Hilton?
[03:54:37.540 --> 03:54:38.540]  I mean, I knew nothing about it.
[03:54:38.540 --> 03:54:46.340]  I heard about it afterward and was very disappointed in him and in what became of it.
[03:54:46.340 --> 03:54:49.980]  Could you make a film like the Hanoi Hilton, do they treat it differently?
[03:54:49.980 --> 03:54:51.660]  No, I don't know.
[03:54:51.660 --> 03:54:55.180]  I really don't know.
[03:54:55.180 --> 03:55:00.260]  You know, they'll put up with drug addiction, you can detox, but they're, thus far as
[03:55:00.260 --> 03:55:05.900]  no acceptable detox procedure for that kind of behavior and whether there should be or
[03:55:05.900 --> 03:55:06.900]  not.
[03:55:06.900 --> 03:55:07.900]  I don't know what's under the discussion.
[03:55:07.900 --> 03:55:10.820]  Could you make the Hanoi Hilton today?
[03:55:10.820 --> 03:55:14.620]  If you hiked up the violence, I mean, it was unfortunately a fairly violent film because
[03:55:14.620 --> 03:55:16.020]  it was a violent experience.
[03:55:16.020 --> 03:55:21.220]  The conceit of Hanoi Hilton, and thank you for will for being part of it, was that it
[03:55:21.220 --> 03:55:24.460]  would be the experiences seen from the eyes of the POWs.
[03:55:24.460 --> 03:55:25.780]  I got a lot of notes.
[03:55:25.780 --> 03:55:32.460]  I had framed for notes from ABC saying the North Vietnamese are not sympathetic enough.
[03:55:32.460 --> 03:55:33.460]  I mean, you need balance.
[03:55:33.460 --> 03:55:37.180]  I said, well, it's for the POWs eyes.
[03:55:37.180 --> 03:55:39.500]  There wasn't much balance for them.
[03:55:39.500 --> 03:55:46.380]  I think if you just made it as just a violent film and stressed the violence more than we
[03:55:46.380 --> 03:55:52.540]  tried to stress the psychological strength of our POWs, you know, over 10,000 Americans
[03:55:52.540 --> 03:56:01.460]  were taken into captivity during the Vietnam War, 730 came home, 730 out of at least 10,000.
[03:56:01.460 --> 03:56:03.380]  So it was a pretty brutal experience.
[03:56:03.380 --> 03:56:08.620]  And I think if you turn it into that, but kind of made the Americans really nasty and
[03:56:08.620 --> 03:56:12.260]  kind of deserving of whatever they got, you might be able to do it that way.
[03:56:12.260 --> 03:56:13.940]  In fact, that was most of the credit.
[03:56:13.940 --> 03:56:20.620]  The liberal critics savaged the film Stanley Kaufman in the New Republic called it filth.
[03:56:20.620 --> 03:56:25.940]  He said authentic and therefore dangerous, at least acknowledge it was authentic.
[03:56:25.940 --> 03:56:32.700]  Their view was on the left that the Americans were evil murderers and the Vietnamese were,
[03:56:32.700 --> 03:56:33.700]  you know, put upon people.
[03:56:33.700 --> 03:56:35.380]  So if you did it with that point of view, you can make it.
[03:56:35.380 --> 03:56:36.380]  But not from the point of view.
[03:56:36.380 --> 03:56:37.380]  I made it.
[03:56:37.380 --> 03:56:38.380]  No, no.
[03:56:38.380 --> 03:56:39.380]  That wouldn't even talk to you.
[03:56:39.380 --> 03:56:43.860]  There's a lot of kind of lip service to the military here.
[03:56:43.860 --> 03:56:47.700]  But in those days, I used to go to meetings where my old Army field jacket with the patches
[03:56:47.700 --> 03:56:54.060]  still on it, just to intimidate people because they'd never seen a soldier, you know, even
[03:56:54.060 --> 03:56:56.500]  when it's limp as me.
[03:56:56.500 --> 03:56:57.500]  Yeah.
[03:56:57.500 --> 03:56:58.500]  Okay.
[03:56:58.500 --> 03:57:00.420]  One last question when I'm going to have to go real quick.
[03:57:00.420 --> 03:57:05.260]  How do you feel about the new Roseanne show coming back with some conservative messages?
[03:57:05.260 --> 03:57:08.140]  I guess she's got a cross-dressing grandchild.
[03:57:08.140 --> 03:57:10.820]  What are they trying to accomplish here real quick?
[03:57:10.820 --> 03:57:14.500]  I think they're just trying to broaden the audience and so they're paying some attention
[03:57:14.500 --> 03:57:17.540]  to the proclivities of Hollywood with, I think, some of that.
[03:57:17.540 --> 03:57:22.820]  Time will tell whether it drifts more to the left or whether it becomes more solid as a
[03:57:22.820 --> 03:57:25.140]  voice for the American working class.
[03:57:25.140 --> 03:57:27.540]  I hope it's the latter and not the former.
[03:57:27.540 --> 03:57:28.540]  Okay.
[03:57:28.540 --> 03:57:31.580]  Lionel Chatwin, thanks so much for all your comments.

[03:59:40.140 --> 03:59:51.980]  against us so we need your support.
