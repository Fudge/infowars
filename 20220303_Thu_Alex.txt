[00:00.000 --> 00:09.120]  It's Thursday, March 3rd. The year is 2022. This is the Alex Jones show. And now it is
[00:09.120 --> 00:15.100]  extremely clear exactly what's going on. The globalists have launched their great
[00:15.100 --> 00:18.900]  reset. They've used the COVID-19 hysteria and fear to roll out the
[00:18.900 --> 00:23.640]  beginnings of their worldwide social credit score. And now they need a pretext
[00:23.640 --> 00:28.680]  to sell the next level of absolute and total censorship and it's everywhere.
[00:28.680 --> 00:33.120]  They're not just taking RT off different cable and satellite systems around the
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.760]  world. They're now going out and targeting Russians that work and live
[00:37.760 --> 00:44.800]  abroad who are prominent in the arts like the major conductor of the Munich
[00:44.800 --> 00:51.360]  Orchestra and having a litmus test just like McCarthy did in the 1950s in the
[00:51.360 --> 00:57.560]  Red Scare that if they don't denounce Putin and if they don't basically get
[00:57.560 --> 01:00.680]  in line with the globalists that they will then lose their job. They will be
[01:00.680 --> 01:09.520]  fired. This is so incredibly dangerous. And just a few days ago, right when
[01:09.520 --> 01:15.800]  Biden signed all these sanctions on to Russia, he at the same time expanded and
[01:15.800 --> 01:21.800]  extended the order for no new oil drilling or gas drilling in almost all
[01:21.800 --> 01:26.440]  of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico. And of course he also signed another
[01:26.440 --> 01:31.640]  order. There's just so much continuing to ban the Keystone pipeline that is open
[01:31.640 --> 01:38.880]  and ready to operate and increase our oil refining and capacity upwards of 30%
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.960]  because the refineries are ready down in Houston and down in Shreveport and
[01:42.960 --> 01:48.360]  South Texas and Louisiana and other areas like Mississippi. But they're not
[01:48.360 --> 01:54.640]  getting the raw oil they need. Instead, that oil is being shipped by train to the
[01:54.640 --> 01:59.440]  West Coast of Canada and shipped to China, Japan and others. This is why
[01:59.440 --> 02:04.600]  America is falling apart. It's why our energy systems are down and on top of it
[02:04.600 --> 02:08.080]  we have Hillary Clinton running around calling for major central banks and
[02:08.080 --> 02:11.200]  governments to take over all the cryptocurrency markets because quote
[02:11.200 --> 02:16.200]  ooh the Russians might use it. It's the same argument hey ban all Americans
[02:16.200 --> 02:23.600]  guns because somebody might illegally use a gun so you have to have your gun
[02:23.600 --> 02:29.960]  taken. This is all a giant power grab the next phase of the great reset and I
[02:29.960 --> 02:33.200]  didn't just start saying that this week or last week or last month or last year.
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.760]  I've been explaining for years before they launched this operation 26 months
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.160]  ago that the next push would be war, would be crackdowns on any type of
[02:43.160 --> 02:49.520]  alternative currency and then the big cyber attack. So here's Pete Buttigieg
[02:49.520 --> 02:55.600]  heads up transportation saying oh we can't have short-term solutions to your
[02:55.600 --> 03:00.240]  oil prices more than doubling in the last year. No no we've got to have long-term
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.400]  solutions which means all the electric garbage that takes even more carbon than
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.240]  gasoline. Again the left never asked where does the power that they get for
[03:09.240 --> 03:12.560]  their cars actually come from and now the governments are mandating electric
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.000]  cars in many parts of the world. They're going up as much as a hundred percent in
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.200]  price. So here's Pete Buttigieg saying hey he's basically echoing what the head
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.320]  of the Department of Energy said oh we're in a transition right now you've
[03:24.320 --> 03:27.320]  just got to get used to it. Here's the clip and we'll be right back on the
[03:27.320 --> 03:32.000]  other side. Costs will go down for American families across the board. I
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.720]  hear you sir but those are long-term solutions for bigger issues and you know
[03:36.720 --> 03:40.360]  we live in a short-term world so I just want to stay on gas for another
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.600]  moment and and you're absolutely right the president doesn't set the price of
[03:44.600 --> 03:49.360]  gas but he can influence it and and while releasing some strategic reserves
[03:49.360 --> 03:53.480]  matters given how much has has been released it's really just a drop in the
[03:53.480 --> 03:58.080]  bucket. Are there things like and I realize it is controversial it has huge
[03:58.080 --> 04:02.960]  environmental impacts could the president possibly consider authorizing the
[04:02.960 --> 04:11.480]  Keystone pipeline working something out with Iran. I mean look the president has
[04:11.480 --> 04:15.880]  said that all options are on the table but we also need to make sure that we're
[04:15.880 --> 04:21.160]  not galloping after permanent solutions to immediate short-term problems where
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.720]  more strategic and tactical actions in the short term can make a difference like
[04:25.720 --> 04:29.520]  what you have with the strategic reserve which exists partly in order to
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.640]  respond to situations like this and of course the president's laid out policies
[04:33.640 --> 04:37.440]  that are going to help cushion the impacts of any volatility in energy
[04:37.440 --> 04:42.480]  markets for the future by building up more of a diversified and homegrown
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.800]  energy base for this country look we don't know what the next curveball is
[04:47.800 --> 04:53.080]  going to be affecting oil prices affecting the global energy markets from a
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.760]  pandemic to a war anything can happen any given day the president's been
[04:57.760 --> 05:06.000]  working to make sure. To life changing life empowering products are now back

[06:33.200 --> 06:41.200]  every form of tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson live from Austin
[06:41.200 --> 06:49.320]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is
[06:49.320 --> 06:56.120]  Thursday March 3rd 2022 I'm your host Alex Jones riding shotgun is Owen
[06:56.120 --> 07:01.960]  shroyer from the studios in Austin Texas it's important to pull back to the 35
[07:01.960 --> 07:07.840]  thousand foot view and realize that everything you're witnessing with the
[07:07.840 --> 07:13.320]  force roll out of the deadly vaccines to the war in Ukraine to hyperinflation
[07:13.320 --> 07:17.680]  around the planet to collapse in third world countries and giant refugee
[07:17.680 --> 07:22.520]  floods coming to the first world is all chronicles and all laid out by the
[07:22.520 --> 07:27.040]  Carnegie endowment by the Rockefeller endowment by the club of Rome and by
[07:27.040 --> 07:31.320]  their spokesperson organization their mouthpiece Klaus Schwab in the world
[07:31.320 --> 07:37.800]  economic forum that's how I always know what their options are and what they're
[07:37.800 --> 07:43.240]  going to do next is because I read what the actual controllers of the world
[07:43.240 --> 07:48.480]  talk about and say and going back more than 25 years ago I was reading books
[07:48.480 --> 07:51.120]  written by all these amazing individuals a lot of them members of
[07:51.120 --> 07:56.440]  Congress members of the House the Senate people like Barry Goldwater people
[07:56.440 --> 08:02.840]  like Ron Paul I mean just Gary Allen so many books that had documents and
[08:02.840 --> 08:08.800]  newspaper clippings and things in them in the 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s and
[08:08.800 --> 08:15.520]  90s with prominent people in Congress having hearings about this and the
[08:15.520 --> 08:19.920]  secretive British intelligence roundtable groups and the corporate
[08:19.920 --> 08:24.520]  espionage groups and how they had a plan to take over all the nation-states and
[08:24.520 --> 08:28.640]  devalue the currencies and bring in a digital currency and break up the family
[08:28.640 --> 08:35.600]  and promote homosexuality I mean all of this has been a blueprint a battle
[08:35.600 --> 08:40.960]  plan but we're not in the beta phase of the battle plan we're now in the
[08:40.960 --> 08:46.480]  operational phase of the battle plan and that's why I don't normally agree with
[08:46.480 --> 08:49.640]  a lot of the globalist analysts all the former top generals and the rest of them
[08:49.640 --> 08:54.840]  from the UK Europe and the US and Canada but now I do when they say that we are
[08:54.840 --> 09:01.200]  the closest to nuclear war the planet has ever been even worse than during the
[09:01.200 --> 09:09.040]  Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960s and the weapons are much more high-tech
[09:09.040 --> 09:15.800]  and much more dangerous today and that's why Putin moved into Ukraine was
[09:15.800 --> 09:18.720]  because Ukraine was talking about getting nuclear weapons from the West and
[09:18.720 --> 09:22.480]  the West have been moving nuclear weapons into the area I'm not defending
[09:22.480 --> 09:29.200]  what Putin did I don't want a war but I see what Kennedy did in the early 1960s
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.840]  during the Cuban Missile Crisis when Russia put intermediate range nukes in
[09:34.840 --> 09:39.560]  Cuba and we told them pull them out or we're gonna invade Cuba and they pulled
[09:39.560 --> 09:45.720]  them out or we would have evaded Cuba it's now been declassified that Kennedy
[09:45.720 --> 09:50.320]  had hundreds of thousands of troops ready the Marines all of it the Army the
[09:50.320 --> 09:55.520]  the amphibious landing craft was all being prepared on the east coast and in
[09:55.520 --> 10:02.840]  Florida to go into Cuba if the Russians didn't pull their missiles out so again
[10:02.840 --> 10:07.760]  that's the real world we're in and all of this is being used to bring in this
[10:07.760 --> 10:12.560]  digital police state to go after crypto and to go after countries that don't do
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.200]  with the IMF and World Bank say and and all of this is the exercise of power of
[10:16.200 --> 10:22.360]  globalism in the future with a casual society global social credit score where
[10:22.360 --> 10:26.240]  if you don't do exactly what they say when they say how they wanted if you
[10:26.240 --> 10:32.720]  don't socially behave precisely like they tell you to you are cut off from the
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.280]  lights turning on for being able to have a car being able to travel being able
[10:36.280 --> 10:39.320]  to get food being able to have a job and then they just say it will you have a
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.120]  right to live on the street and the whole social safety network that they've
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.720]  built up that encourages people to be homeless will then be removed and we're
[10:47.720 --> 10:53.120]  gonna see the real collapse of civilization that's what the globalists
[10:53.120 --> 10:55.640]  have done in the third world for in the last two years they caught off the food
[10:55.640 --> 11:00.680]  many areas under IMF and World Bank directives are still under lockdown in
[11:00.680 --> 11:06.760]  Latin America and in Africa and over 40 million have starved to death so when
[11:06.760 --> 11:10.280]  we're talking about the war crimes of Vladimir Putin and by any yardstick you
[11:10.280 --> 11:15.080]  could argue invading a sovereign country that hasn't attacked you is that we've
[11:15.080 --> 11:17.600]  got to understand the globalists have already launched their new type of war
[11:17.600 --> 11:22.320]  which is really a modern form of ancient war total siege with their global
[11:22.320 --> 11:28.760]  lockdowns and have rolled out a biological attack against the people of
[11:28.760 --> 11:31.840]  the world through the virus they created in Wuhan now on record to be man-made
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.840]  and confirmed and then through the vaccines that aren't vaccines that
[11:35.840 --> 11:39.640]  create the same deadly spike protein in the body it levels much higher than the
[11:39.640 --> 11:44.520]  natural infection and that's why when I saw the Russian news report that there
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.920]  were Western bio labs level 4 bio labs in Ukraine and that indeed Russia was
[11:49.920 --> 11:55.360]  bombing those I thought well that could be wartime propaganda all sides are
[11:55.360 --> 11:58.200]  putting out a lot of bull right now we've we've we've covered when both sides
[11:58.200 --> 12:03.080]  are lying we've also covered when different sides tell the truth but now
[12:03.080 --> 12:07.200]  it's coming out we've got articles and infowars.com indeed confirming very
[12:07.200 --> 12:11.920]  dangerous level 4 bio weapon labs in Ukraine that the West was funding and
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.120]  then you start realizing that it is the UN it is the globalists that we're
[12:17.120 --> 12:20.920]  running the Wuhan lab and the lab also in Chapel Hill North Carolina not just
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.280]  China and they are the ones that patented it and they are the ones that
[12:24.280 --> 12:28.960]  released it and so you have to then give people the benefit of the doubt when
[12:28.960 --> 12:32.200]  they say these type of labs were set up and we're actually threatening Russia
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.640]  because aren't these labs around the world matter where they are threatening
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.920]  all of humanity just Senator Rand Paul has said but then I add to that the way
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.120]  to shut down a bio weapon lab is not to bomb it that's how you could actually
[12:46.120 --> 12:49.480]  release the virus if Russia thought these labs were doing this they should
[12:49.480 --> 12:52.800]  have made a big deal about it they should have come out and called out the
[12:52.800 --> 12:57.800]  labs and called out what was happening around the world because again this is
[12:57.800 --> 13:02.240]  a global system of mad scientists who want total control over every aspect of
[13:02.240 --> 13:07.480]  life and they will use crises they will exacerbate crises they will create
[13:07.480 --> 13:11.720]  crises they will create false flags as a pretext for their control just
[13:11.720 --> 13:16.760]  remember a month ago the State Department CIA spokesman was up there
[13:16.760 --> 13:20.640]  saying we know Putin's gonna stage false flags in each of Ukraine we know he's
[13:20.640 --> 13:26.160]  got 200,000 troops is planning to invade and the reporter said that's Alex
[13:26.160 --> 13:30.880]  Jones territory but I was honest once the war started to come out and say well
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.800]  looks like finally the Pentagon and the State Department the CIA for once told
[13:35.800 --> 13:41.080]  the truth that indeed Putin was planning to invade it actually told the
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.320]  Chinese months before they would wait until the Olympics were over and
[13:45.320 --> 13:50.360]  several Russian politicians like Varanasi and others went on TV it turns
[13:50.360 --> 13:55.720]  out a month before the attack and said the attack would happen on February 22nd
[13:55.720 --> 14:01.120]  2022 which it did so this is just really really interesting and amazing
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.920]  information and people ask me how I know the future it's again not a crystal
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.120]  ball folks I'm not not so dumb as it's actually read and watch what the Chinese
[14:12.120 --> 14:15.720]  are saying what the Russians are saying what the Germans are saying what the US
[14:15.720 --> 14:21.000]  is saying I actually study all these facets and then ask well who would stand
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.080]  to gain from a false flag and if it is the pretext to invade Ukraine for every
[14:25.080 --> 14:29.160]  reason whether Putin was right or wrong it would be a false flag and then we saw
[14:29.160 --> 14:32.280]  a bunch of car bombings and truck bombings as the pretext for him to
[14:32.280 --> 14:36.600]  invade now did Putin do that or did the Ukrainians actually detonate a bunch of
[14:36.600 --> 14:42.240]  truck bombs and car bombs hoping that Russia would invade I don't think they
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.640]  have the motive for that but I do know now some of the mayors and people in the
[14:46.640 --> 14:49.760]  eastern area of Ukraine that were pro-Russia have now been kidnapped and
[14:49.760 --> 14:55.600]  assassinated and the Ukrainian government Zelensky is celebrating that so
[14:55.600 --> 15:01.160]  this is a very complex area very complex issues and I'm simply trying to get
[15:01.160 --> 15:05.400]  people to learn who the players are and what the history is so that we can make
[15:05.400 --> 15:08.840]  our own decisions and not just be bombarded with propaganda and not be
[15:08.840 --> 15:13.840]  able to decide for it so yes we are all in Alex Jones territory now you get an
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.080]  Alex Jones territory when you actually start studying the history the different
[15:17.080 --> 15:20.240]  layers of things the different power structures and when you realize you're
[15:20.240 --> 15:23.480]  an Alex Jones territory you realize you're in the territory with a ruthless
[15:23.480 --> 15:27.520]  global elite with advanced technologies that think they're God they're trying to
[15:27.520 --> 15:31.000]  bring in a world crisis the pretext for total domination and control of
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.840]  humanity forever that's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen on the road Owen
[15:35.840 --> 15:38.720]  Schreuer here back in studio we are going to be hearing from Alex again

[20:35.480 --> 20:40.120]  transmission but I just want to be completely clear with everybody in my
[20:40.120 --> 20:46.720]  view the world is the most danger it has ever been in modern history we are in
[20:46.720 --> 20:52.080]  the greatest danger posed by humans against humans that our world has ever
[20:52.080 --> 20:57.840]  seen and it's only going to intensify look at some of the headlines on drudge
[20:57.840 --> 21:03.520]  report putin I'm taking it all planning martial law flights to capture Europe's
[21:03.520 --> 21:06.840]  biggest nuclear power plant 9,000 soldiers killed
[21:06.840 --> 21:14.480]  criminal advisor cannot comprehend invasion exodus as refugees flood into
[21:14.480 --> 21:20.000]  Europe at least a million Kiev shrines memorials at risk now they first read
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.160]  the claim that putin targeted a holocaust shrine in Kiev and it wasn't
[21:24.160 --> 21:31.120]  true Kiev shines memorials at risk NATO pours weapons in mood darkens in
[21:31.120 --> 21:36.240]  Moscow india china abstain on you invoke condemn Venezuela slams sanctions as
[21:36.240 --> 21:41.160]  madness enormous scale of financial pain worry some of the west more week two
[21:41.160 --> 21:49.280]  first city falls Odessa braces Russian satellite attack goes on and on from
[21:49.280 --> 21:55.840]  there why did we have world war one why do we have world war two why do we have
[21:55.840 --> 22:00.600]  the cold war because there are different powerful blocks of governments and
[22:00.600 --> 22:06.560]  corporations that want full control of the planet but if we go back to the cold
[22:06.560 --> 22:11.760]  war even back to world war two of the Nazis it was the most powerful richest
[22:11.760 --> 22:17.440]  families in the United States and the UK that we're working with the most
[22:17.440 --> 22:21.520]  powerful families in the Austrian Hungarian Empire or what was left of it
[22:21.520 --> 22:28.560]  and even at the end of world war two all of the major company owners that
[22:28.560 --> 22:32.360]  produced the planes the tanks the flamethrowers that used the slave labor
[22:32.360 --> 22:37.720]  at the death camps they all just faded off into the background and kept all of
[22:37.720 --> 22:40.720]  their major ownership and then they founded the Bilderberg group in the
[22:40.720 --> 22:45.440]  early 1950s with British and US intelligence and that forms the new
[22:45.440 --> 22:52.920]  world order that we're under today so remember Putin's main job in the KGB and
[22:52.920 --> 23:01.000]  he rose the head of the section in East Germany was interfacing with Western
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.280]  intelligence and working with Western intelligence and I'm not saying that
[23:05.280 --> 23:11.560]  Putin is a double age for the globalist I'm explaining at that high level just
[23:11.560 --> 23:15.360]  like with world war one and world war two behind the scenes deals are being made
[23:15.360 --> 23:20.800]  and broken and then made again and broken again with these high-level dealers
[23:20.800 --> 23:27.680]  just like Stalin and Hitler made deals the first few years of world war two but
[23:27.680 --> 23:32.980]  again we know the globalists are creating a cascade of events with the
[23:32.980 --> 23:38.120]  COVID and the lockdowns and the wars and the cyber attacks and the collapse in
[23:38.120 --> 23:42.520]  terrible populations and the black lives matter racial division worldwide to
[23:42.520 --> 23:48.200]  destabilize the planet to bring in the one world government cashless society
[23:48.200 --> 23:51.160]  here's the most important thing I've said today and the whole point of the
[23:51.160 --> 23:55.120]  broadcast is this a the world's the greatest danger in its history of nuclear
[23:55.120 --> 23:59.640]  war nobody denies that hands down so people should know how serious this is
[23:59.640 --> 24:03.080]  and be involved and be informed I know this audience is and so I say God bless
[24:03.080 --> 24:10.120]  you I salute you number two buy the central bank of Russia having its
[24:10.120 --> 24:17.720]  holdings in other private central banks grabbed it is endangering the entire
[24:17.720 --> 24:25.680]  global banking reserve system and pushing US hegemony in dollars
[24:25.680 --> 24:32.160]  supremacy towards the edge of a cliff and is incrementally making countries
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.600]  hold less and less dollars in their reserves and making them buy less and
[24:35.600 --> 24:42.000]  less US and EU bonds if you go back a few decades ago 90 plus percent of the
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.680]  world bonds were being held in US currency now at 60 percent and that
[24:48.680 --> 24:53.680]  acceleration has mainly been in the last decade so you can pull these numbers up
[24:53.680 --> 24:57.960]  for yourself you can see this for yourself why are the policymakers doing
[24:57.960 --> 25:03.800]  things that push everybody into the arms of Russia China and India and we have
[25:03.800 --> 25:06.840]  memos that were leaked out of the Chinese where they said we'll act like
[25:06.840 --> 25:13.960]  we're neutral or lack like you know we don't want Russia to invade Ukraine but
[25:13.960 --> 25:17.480]  we're gonna secretly back it because they're gonna back us when going to
[25:17.480 --> 25:20.920]  Taiwan and so for some of the people out there that don't like being called
[25:20.920 --> 25:25.240]  Russian agents by the lefts are sick of it that will then manipulate your
[25:25.240 --> 25:29.480]  psychology to then go and think okay well Putin must be great when you've got
[25:29.480 --> 25:32.200]  to pull back and see the Chinese involvement all the rest of it and just
[25:32.200 --> 25:37.280]  how complex this is and then once you look at it from a Bilderberg group or
[25:37.280 --> 25:41.320]  Davos group level through their eyes then it all begins to make sense we need
[25:41.320 --> 25:45.760]  to bring to justice Fauci and Bill Gates and the people that launched this
[25:45.760 --> 25:49.080]  virus and lied to Congress about the virus that have been caught red-handed
[25:49.080 --> 25:52.960]  creating a virus we need to do what governor DeSantis is doing we'll play
[25:52.960 --> 25:57.440]  that clip coming up here at the start of the next segment and tell the kids take
[25:57.440 --> 26:01.480]  your damn mask off it's a symbol of mind control and brainwashing and
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.560]  slavery we need to be calling out the system or they're just gonna bring out
[26:06.560 --> 26:12.000]  a new virus that have more lockdowns with their global ID we have to get on the
[26:12.000 --> 26:19.000]  offense right now ladies and gentlemen and realize that you can have an enemy
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.360]  like Russia you can have an enemy like China you can have an enemy like the
[26:22.360 --> 26:26.920]  globalist in DC but at a certain level they're just puppets to the larger
[26:26.920 --> 26:32.280]  international financial system at which black rock sits at the very very top
[26:32.280 --> 26:37.560]  when you study what black rocks doing black rock is involved in all of the
[26:37.560 --> 26:41.960]  black lives matter the SJW the UN funding the open borders the chemicals in
[26:41.960 --> 26:45.960]  the water the transgenderism the devaluation of the currencies and the
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.800]  push of course for all these different wars while at the same time back in China
[26:50.800 --> 26:55.760]  a hundred percent against America so it feels good a primitive level to point
[26:55.760 --> 26:58.120]  our finger at the Russians and say they're the big enemy now and you know
[26:58.120 --> 27:02.400]  let everything be focused on them when Russia is a very small piece of this what
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.760]  they're doing in Ukraine is a very small piece of the larger operation where
[27:06.760 --> 27:13.240]  we're all being hit by biological weapons by the globalist they cooked up
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.520]  that virus they made it in the lab they released it that's now confirmed but
[27:17.520 --> 27:22.920]  that's being eclipsed that's being hidden by the new hysteria that is the
[27:22.920 --> 27:28.560]  situation in Ukraine so a full understanding of the public of the
[27:28.560 --> 27:33.600]  great reset mention collapse the world systems on its ashes build their world
[27:33.600 --> 27:37.520]  government of transhumanism and depopulation known as build back
[27:37.520 --> 27:40.960]  better which the crypt keeper talked about in the state of the union two
[27:40.960 --> 27:45.840]  nights ago build back America better when you hear that that means losing your
[27:45.840 --> 27:50.880]  rights massive crime defunding police having your guns taken having deadly
[27:50.880 --> 27:55.000]  shots forced on you and your family they know we were waking up they know we
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.440]  were getting involved they know we were getting informed and so the systems
[27:59.440 --> 28:03.000]  backed off on the COVID but only for a short period of time and Bill Gates has
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.920]  even said that we've got to continue to hammer and continue to expose them or
[28:07.920 --> 28:13.040]  all that we've gained will be for nothing and the new order will simply take
[28:13.040 --> 28:18.480]  back control as soon as we go back to sleep so again pray for peace pray for
[28:18.480 --> 28:21.680]  a global awakening and whatever you do support independent media because
[28:21.680 --> 28:24.840]  they're using this whole rush of situation at an unprecedented level to

[30:19.720 --> 30:23.840]  censorship and now across the world for the United States to Europe

[32:15.600 --> 32:21.600]  into a human depopulation great reset combine trying to collapse our society
[32:21.600 --> 32:26.800]  to build on its ashes there they're transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing

[33:26.480 --> 33:30.760]  ton to Owen shroyer I want to thank you all for tuning of the broadcast and we
[33:30.760 --> 33:34.640]  encourage you to remind you again to realize that if you don't spread the
[33:34.640 --> 33:37.160]  word and if you don't spread the articles and video nobody will and we're
[33:37.160 --> 33:41.080]  gonna lose control of the globalist and be an even deeper trouble but because of
[33:41.080 --> 33:44.320]  you taking action because of this audience being a little tip of the spear
[33:44.320 --> 33:48.640]  we have a very very good fighting chance and at the end God is gonna take us over
[33:48.640 --> 33:52.800]  to the next level we're gonna defeat the New World Order God is gonna take us
[33:52.800 --> 33:57.640]  over all these obstacles that the globalists have put in front of us I
[33:57.640 --> 34:01.960]  wanted to play one more clip here that hand the baton to Owen and that is what
[34:01.960 --> 34:06.440]  the other DeSantis in Florida just did where he walks up the podium and here
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.440]  are these high school students and they're all wearing masks in the cult and
[34:10.440 --> 34:14.440]  he just says take them off it's stupid it's dumb and then you see Biden at the
[34:14.440 --> 34:18.200]  state of the Union coming in not wearing his shaking all the hands but then
[34:18.200 --> 34:25.680]  getting on Air Force one wearing one it is absolute clownery like him on Ash
[34:25.680 --> 34:30.000]  Wednesday you know have an ashes on his head saying he's a Catholic when he is
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.880]  absolutely pro-abortion so it's virtues say going to everyone that's what it is
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.600]  and and you agree to the biomedical tyranny you agree to the fear you agree
[34:39.600 --> 34:44.040]  to the lie you agree to future lockdowns you agree to force inoculations you
[34:44.040 --> 34:49.160]  agree to this biomedical tyranny you agree that Fauci and everyone can be
[34:49.160 --> 34:51.960]  over you and control your life and control your space you agree to all the
[34:51.960 --> 34:56.760]  censorship that's happened the last two years you've agreed a big pharma and big
[34:56.760 --> 35:00.480]  tech in the media all working together to censor people when you wear the damn
[35:00.480 --> 35:05.240]  mask ladies and gentlemen when you cover your face you are truly in a cult and
[35:05.240 --> 35:08.320]  there's one other big piece of information I want to talk about them
[35:08.320 --> 35:15.480]  we'll go to the DeSantis clip and that of course is the surgeon general the same
[35:15.480 --> 35:19.480]  guy that got up on TV last year and said natural immunity doesn't exist well
[35:19.480 --> 35:24.880]  now he sent a letter to big tech saying I want to know how many people saw
[35:24.880 --> 35:28.720]  disinformation which again creates the idea that they can just say what
[35:28.720 --> 35:32.560]  disinformation is and I want to know how many people got hurt because they were
[35:32.560 --> 35:38.560]  told lies about COVID and about the vaccines and about alternative
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.680]  treatments because we need to make sure this doesn't happen again next time
[35:43.680 --> 35:49.120]  think about that statement they're weaponizing every agency remember when
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.120]  the CDC said it was going to nationalize all rents and take control of all
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.040]  renters properties basically the file the Supreme Court said no you can't do
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.840]  that well now we have the surgeon general as stupid as that deputy head of
[36:02.840 --> 36:06.080]  health and human services that's a man that thinks he's a woman and these
[36:06.080 --> 36:11.600]  little again Star Trek outfits or admiral outfits telling us that who he wants
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.240]  the big tech data where they spy on people to learn who's been naughty so
[36:16.240 --> 36:19.480]  that we could be censored and more controlled I guess the next time his
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.480]  handlers and bosses want to cook up a virus and release it so he can then
[36:23.480 --> 36:28.640]  suppress all the Avramectin and vitamin D and vitamin zinc news so so they can
[36:28.640 --> 36:32.440]  suppress the bidesadine news so you get a higher kill number a higher kill
[36:32.440 --> 36:37.120]  ratio when they intubate people I mean this is sick you have big pharma
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.120]  controlling the CDC the FDA controlling this monster that was put in there
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.360]  perched on top of us trying to keep us from actually even learning what they're
[36:46.360 --> 36:49.480]  up to and what they're doing and then having the nerve after all their lies
[36:49.480 --> 36:53.200]  and all their fraud and all their insider trading and all their criminal
[36:53.200 --> 36:58.040]  activity telling us that we're the bad guys and that big tech is going to be
[36:58.040 --> 37:03.280]  reporting back to the admiral about what we're up to so we're going to play a
[37:03.280 --> 37:08.800]  clip of the Santas here and that I was going to take over the broadcast but man
[37:08.800 --> 37:13.000]  it's just amazing to know that they intended to push these lockdowns
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.960]  longer they intended to push the mass longer they intended to keep us
[37:15.960 --> 37:19.840]  locked down forever just like Australia just like Germany and Austria and New
[37:19.840 --> 37:24.240]  Zealand but because of the massive pushback in places like the US and the
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.120]  UK they're having to turn it back same thing in Canada which just goes to show
[37:28.120 --> 37:32.520]  resistance is victory submission is death and in full wars is the very
[37:32.520 --> 37:36.840]  definition of victory and resistance because of all of you and we support
[37:36.840 --> 37:39.720]  life and we support liberty and we just want to thank the listeners everybody
[37:39.720 --> 37:43.560]  because we've come so far in courts in Europe and courts in New Zealand and
[37:43.560 --> 37:47.280]  courts all over are saying forced vaccines are illegal they violate the
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.600]  Nuremberg code the globalists know all this folks they tried to hide it in
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.080]  plain view they tried to gaslight us and sell tyranny but it hasn't worked and
[37:56.080 --> 38:01.520]  thank God we've got people like the Santas calling it out and just pointing
[38:01.520 --> 38:06.480]  out to people that you can take the damn face diaper off you don't have to live
[38:06.480 --> 38:10.080]  in the mind control you don't have to live in the brainwashing anymore and
[38:10.080 --> 38:13.160]  then after we play the DeSantis clip there's one more short clip that's got
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.240]  to go viral of Jimmy Dore explaining what's really happened as well and then
[38:17.240 --> 38:23.320]  I'll destroy your takes over info wars.com tomorrow's news today you do not
[38:23.320 --> 38:27.560]  have to wear those masks I mean please take honestly it's not doing anything
[38:27.560 --> 38:31.400]  and we got to stop with this focus theater so you want to wear it fine but
[38:31.400 --> 38:39.200]  this isn't this is ridiculous all right well it's good to be at USF
[38:39.200 --> 38:44.320]  remember what a conspiracy is a conspiracy is one person working with
[38:44.320 --> 38:49.120]  another person to do something I could I could think of lots of conspiracies
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.520]  that are surround COVID people in power working together to promote propaganda
[38:54.520 --> 38:58.800]  or a lie about something that's what I'm talking about for instance when I got
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.880]  injured by the vaccine I was put into a trial and one of the drugs they gave me
[39:02.880 --> 39:06.560]  in that trial was ivermectin and I said to the doctor I said hey isn't that
[39:06.560 --> 39:10.360]  horse poison and he said no that's propaganda and the reason why they're
[39:10.360 --> 39:14.440]  saying that is because if it turns out that ivermectin can treat COVID they
[39:14.440 --> 39:17.920]  wouldn't be able to get emergency use authorization for those vaccines and I
[39:17.920 --> 39:20.880]  said but so what why wouldn't they just want ivermectin couldn't they make
[39:20.880 --> 39:25.800]  money off ivermectin and he said no they can't because it's off patent now it's a
[39:25.800 --> 39:30.000]  generic and anybody could make it so when I found out that they were lying at
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.080]  the top of their lungs about ivermectin I started to look into other things and
[39:34.080 --> 39:38.400]  everywhere I looked it turned out they were lying they were lying about masks
[39:38.400 --> 39:42.280]  they were lying about herd immunity they were lying about mandates they were
[39:42.280 --> 39:47.840]  lying about ivermectin everything that I looked into they were lying of course if
[39:47.840 --> 39:52.040]  you say that people call you a Trump or a right-winger and a conspiracy theorist
[39:52.040 --> 39:55.240]  like this guy just did and I just want to let that guy know that a pothead
[39:55.240 --> 39:59.440]  comedian in his garage knows that there's a conspiracy around COVID you have
[39:59.440 --> 40:04.080]  to be a liar or someone who just had a stroke to not see that this is what's
[40:04.080 --> 40:09.040]  happening all right ladies and gentlemen oh and shroy are now here in the info
[40:09.040 --> 40:16.560]  wars world headquarters in austin texas taking over here the transmissions for
[40:16.560 --> 40:26.160]  the next five hours plus not to mention our fourth-hour host paul joseph watson
[40:26.160 --> 40:37.440]  now again I've got huge news desk today tons of video clips and really I think
[40:37.440 --> 40:44.480]  it's a time of revelation I don't mean that in a biblical sense I know that you
[40:44.480 --> 40:49.160]  know that you can say that as well but but I don't mean that in a biblical sense
[40:49.160 --> 40:57.200]  I mean it's why the trend alex jones was right is one of the top trends on the
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.080]  internet right now because all the things that info wars and alex jones has
[41:01.080 --> 41:07.720]  been talking about for decades is now being revealed even even some of the
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.240]  things that we've just been discussing in in the shorter term the last two or
[41:11.240 --> 41:18.920]  three years is all being revealed so let me just just tell you the waterfront
[41:18.920 --> 41:22.800]  here before the great guests come on today we've got dr. ben marbles coming
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.000]  up from my free doctor dot com we're gonna get his response to this to the
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.000]  Pfizer documents that just came out and then I'm gonna have in the next hour the
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.520]  one o'clock hour central dr. brian artist artist excuse me the doctor artist show
[41:38.520 --> 41:46.920]  will get his response to the side effects as well and then by the way I'll
[41:46.920 --> 41:49.720]  just mention it now since I'm doing it coming up on the war room will have
[41:49.720 --> 41:53.600]  jesse lee peterson will have alex stein will have jim hoffed so great guests
[41:53.600 --> 41:58.320]  coming up today on info wars live transmissions now here's what I'm gonna
[41:58.320 --> 42:01.440]  be getting to and the way I've just been doing this today just approaching it
[42:01.440 --> 42:06.240]  like a six-hour news show day so some of this I'll get to on the jones show some
[42:06.240 --> 42:11.680]  of this will wait we'll get to on the war room stack over here of just just all
[42:11.680 --> 42:19.520]  of the latest news since the Pfizer data dump and the response from the
[42:19.520 --> 42:30.120]  government the response from the media and then sadly it's just so bad when
[42:30.120 --> 42:34.200]  the athletes college athletes are dying and then I've got this huge stack I mean
[42:34.200 --> 42:37.520]  I've got so much of an update coming out of Ukraine I think that's what I'm gonna
[42:37.520 --> 42:45.440]  do when we come back cultural news political news and by the way we've
[42:45.440 --> 42:49.800]  got footage today folks look I've been saying it for years and Savage has
[42:49.800 --> 42:52.320]  written books liberalism is a mental disorder but folks that they're they're
[42:52.320 --> 42:56.760]  reaching a breaking point they're they're becoming psychotic now in their
[42:56.760 --> 43:13.160]  behavior I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.600]  son or getting x3 to try the products and see how amazing they are and I
[43:18.600 --> 43:24.080]  believe you will then get hooked on them by myself my family and the crew are so
[43:24.080 --> 43:28.480]  again both these products are back in stock both x3 and one or son they are
[43:28.480 --> 43:33.400]  50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price
[43:33.400 --> 43:38.880]  I would estimate in less than a month so this is your chance to get x3 and
[43:38.880 --> 43:42.240]  experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens this is your chance to have
[43:42.240 --> 43:46.520]  the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your muses as well they're
[43:46.520 --> 43:50.840]  amazing and they're an info or store.com and the reason this is a 360 win it it
[43:50.840 --> 43:55.800]  funds the operation I need funds to run the operation you need to be healthy we
[43:55.800 --> 44:01.480]  need to stay on air it's a match made in heaven the COVID-19 face diaper is a
[44:01.480 --> 44:08.720]  symbol of subservience a symbol of slavery a symbol of the change that the
[44:08.720 --> 44:12.920]  medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[44:12.920 --> 44:18.720]  in place it is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will
[44:18.720 --> 44:23.080]  never emerge it is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must
[44:23.080 --> 44:29.920]  cover a diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun it is the symbol of
[44:29.920 --> 44:37.640]  our complete and total absolute surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen we
[44:37.640 --> 44:43.040]  are crossing the Rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon us
[44:43.040 --> 44:46.640]  claus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips
[44:46.640 --> 44:51.480]  as part of the world ID and carbon taxes things only get worse from here if we
[44:51.480 --> 44:57.080]  submit they only get better if we resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance
[44:57.080 --> 45:07.080]  non-compliance
[45:07.080 --> 45:12.560]  people are asleep and program controlled I agree how do you make the sleeper
[45:12.560 --> 45:17.040]  awake in William hi Alice thanks for taking my call can I plug Alex real
[45:17.040 --> 45:23.200]  quick go ahead hey I'm in my 60s and I did the work of 25 30 year olds and I
[45:23.200 --> 45:26.360]  worked them into the ground and you wanted to why and I've tested this and
[45:26.360 --> 45:31.160]  I've taken your B12 and let me tell you when I don't take it I pay a price I
[45:31.160 --> 45:36.720]  really do I take that B12 and I'm electric man I can run 10 miles I I
[45:36.720 --> 45:40.960]  did some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends will
[45:40.960 --> 45:46.400]  test to the fact that yeah for a guy in his 60s you know pushing 70 I'm and I
[45:46.400 --> 45:52.280]  know I'm not just low in smoke here the B12 saves my life
[45:57.280 --> 46:04.360]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need that you want
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.280]  that you're gonna be happy with that's why you come back and buy products for
[46:08.280 --> 46:12.840]  me again it's a symbiotic relationship I promote liberty I promote freedom I
[46:12.840 --> 46:16.560]  fight the globalist and I'm able to do that because you buy products and then
[46:16.560 --> 46:20.440]  for short I come and listen all the products are great but when it comes to
[46:20.440 --> 46:24.840]  high quality storeable food in an inflationary system with major supply
[46:24.840 --> 46:30.680]  chain breakdowns this is an absolute 360 win a no-brainer and they've got high
[46:30.680 --> 46:34.040]  quality storeable food ready to ship to you right now the great folks at my
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.920]  page with supply exclusively prepare Alex comm discounted so again beat
[46:38.920 --> 46:43.160]  inflation be prepared fund the info or the only way you lose is not taking
[46:43.160 --> 46:48.840]  action at info or store calm prepare with Alex comm right now this is high
[46:48.840 --> 46:52.760]  quality storeable food this is how you beat inflation get yours today it's
[46:52.760 --> 46:56.200]  ready to ship but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up this
[46:56.200 --> 46:59.440]  inflation is exploding
[46:59.440 --> 47:08.920]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[47:15.760 --> 47:20.960]  ladies and gentlemen I have really about an hour and a half or two hours of
[47:20.960 --> 47:25.840]  Russia Ukraine coverage here I'm gonna try my best to get as much out in the
[47:25.840 --> 47:35.480]  next 15 minutes of this live transmission before Dr. Marbles joins me but at
[47:35.480 --> 47:38.760]  the end of this I'm probably gonna have to parse the segments together where I
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.960]  cover all of it to then put out in a larger segment on band.video because
[47:43.960 --> 47:46.520]  it's just gonna have to be kind of like okay we cover it and then we back off and
[47:46.520 --> 47:49.320]  then we cover it and so it's a little clunky for talk radio but we'll put it
[47:49.320 --> 47:54.360]  into a full video on band.video so that it it makes sense and it's a more
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.120]  fluid coverage so so let me just stop right there because that time is of the
[47:58.120 --> 48:10.800]  essence here where to begin now there are stories going around and and Russia has
[48:10.800 --> 48:16.200]  even made statements in regards to this I just needed to get triple confirmation
[48:16.200 --> 48:23.520]  before I covered it about US bio weapons labs in Ukraine now we know about the
[48:23.520 --> 48:28.520]  Ukrainian corruption we know about the Western influence where they use Ukraine
[48:28.520 --> 48:34.160]  as kind of just a political laundering grounds and money laundering grounds and
[48:34.160 --> 48:41.040]  we know that it was Obama and Biden and Soros that had an illegitimate
[48:41.040 --> 48:47.280]  overthrow of the Ukrainian government to install an anti-Russian government to
[48:47.280 --> 48:54.600]  provoke this now here's what the media doesn't tell you and let me just put it
[48:54.600 --> 49:01.200]  into this statement before I come back to it later after covering the biological
[49:01.200 --> 49:06.960]  lab information when you're only allowed to hear one side of the story
[49:06.960 --> 49:13.680]  something is up when you're only allowed or you only see one side of the story
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.040]  something is up that's what's going on in Ukraine you're only allowed to hear
[49:18.040 --> 49:21.520]  one side of the story and that's Ukraine the victims Ukraine the greatest
[49:21.520 --> 49:26.200]  Zelensky a hero anything coming out of there is gonna favor that narrative and
[49:26.200 --> 49:31.320]  you're only hearing from Zelensky across the American media spectrum now
[49:31.320 --> 49:34.400]  Putin gave a speech today did you hear that did you hear about that do you know
[49:34.400 --> 49:39.160]  about that you're gonna see that anywhere no you should be very suspicious of
[49:39.160 --> 49:46.680]  that why won't American media show you both sides of the story doesn't mean
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.480]  they have to support it but you think you'd want full spectrum information
[49:51.480 --> 50:01.280]  there and here's what here's what it equates to for years Russia whether
[50:01.280 --> 50:08.480]  it's at the UN or anywhere has been begging for a seat at the table begging
[50:08.480 --> 50:14.720]  for the world to listen to them about their concerns with NATO and about their
[50:14.720 --> 50:20.840]  concerns with Western influence on Ukrainian elections and with their
[50:20.840 --> 50:25.200]  concerns about the world and culture they just get no seat at the table
[50:25.200 --> 50:28.760]  nobody listens them they're told buzz off we're not listening you're the bad
[50:28.760 --> 50:36.080]  guys screw you well Russia's sick of that Russia wants a seat at the table
[50:36.080 --> 50:42.520]  Russia wants its concerns to be heard and and nobody listened now they are or
[50:42.520 --> 50:47.480]  wait are they so Russia desperately decides okay fine we'll invade Ukraine
[50:47.480 --> 50:55.280]  will you listen to me now can you hear me now but no nope still not allowed to
[50:55.280 --> 50:58.640]  hear from Russia still not allowed to hear what's going on banning all Russian
[50:58.640 --> 51:03.560]  media banning all Russian commentary banning President Putin from even
[51:03.560 --> 51:11.120]  getting a message out but let's wind it back why did the US Embassy official
[51:11.120 --> 51:17.080]  website just remove all evidence of Ukrainian bioweapons labs stories at
[51:17.080 --> 51:24.160]  info wars.com now we're working on trying to get Dr. Francis Boyle back on but
[51:24.160 --> 51:27.560]  he's very busy and he was unavailable today
[51:27.560 --> 51:32.680]  snopes says that oh it's not true there's no biological labs in Ukraine it's not
[51:32.680 --> 51:37.760]  going on well let me just read for you because Dr. Boyle was kind enough to give
[51:37.760 --> 51:42.840]  me a quote and he said I can quote him on this on the air now again this is
[51:42.840 --> 51:50.280]  this is Dr. Boyle who came on this transmission in February I think actually
[51:50.280 --> 51:54.440]  late January was the first time late January 2020 and then again February
[51:54.440 --> 51:59.880]  2020 saying it's a it's a Wuhan lab it's a biological lab leak it's the research
[51:59.880 --> 52:04.080]  they've been doing gain a function SARS COVID viruses all of that ended up
[52:04.080 --> 52:09.960]  coming true Dr. Francis Boyle and of course what did they say they ran the
[52:09.960 --> 52:13.200]  fact checks at the time saying that's not true that's not the case now it's been
[52:13.200 --> 52:18.320]  totally 100% vindicated so that's the track record of Dr. Francis Boyle it's
[52:18.320 --> 52:23.840]  about as good as you can get this is a quote from him the US bio warfare
[52:23.840 --> 52:28.080]  laboratories are extremely dangerous they must be secured and safely
[52:28.080 --> 52:32.160]  decontaminated and then rendered permanently disabled by professionals
[52:32.160 --> 52:38.680]  blowing them up is just too dangerous that would release bio warfare agents
[52:38.680 --> 52:48.880]  into the environment that could infect human beings so in other words the
[52:48.880 --> 52:55.800]  biological labs do exist in Ukraine and just like with the Wuhan lab there is
[52:55.800 --> 53:03.760]  Western interest and involvement in those labs and it was someone that called in
[53:03.760 --> 53:06.320]  yesterday I think it was on the war room saying hey are they gonna blow up
[53:06.320 --> 53:09.800]  those labs I've heard they blown up the labs and I said well I doubt Russia would
[53:09.800 --> 53:16.000]  blow up those labs but I'm sure Russia would have an interest a human interest
[53:16.000 --> 53:22.120]  in stopping whatever it is they're doing in those labs Russia was even afraid
[53:22.120 --> 53:28.280]  that they were making genetic genetically targeted or race specific
[53:28.280 --> 53:33.360]  bio weapons in that lab to target Russians which we already know they were
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.360]  doing in China that was already confirmed with Peter Dossick and Anthony
[53:38.360 --> 53:45.320]  Fauci involvement in the Wuhan lab and other labs in China making race specific
[53:45.320 --> 53:50.040]  bio weapons now look think about it like this though pretty much anything that
[53:50.040 --> 53:57.000]  you can conceive somebody else is probably already doing you understand
[53:57.000 --> 54:03.440]  that concept it's been something that's been proven time and time again to me
[54:03.440 --> 54:08.120]  throughout my life if I can conceive it in my head and it's a practically
[54:08.120 --> 54:13.280]  applicable thing then somebody else is probably already doing that so do you
[54:13.280 --> 54:18.080]  think they can make a race specific weapon a race specific bio weapon in the
[54:18.080 --> 54:21.920]  year 2022 do you think somebody maybe can do that you think about that they
[54:21.920 --> 54:28.080]  already are so anyway I've just got this stack of news here where it's oh the
[54:28.080 --> 54:31.840]  labs don't exist no there's no such thing and then and then there's the
[54:31.840 --> 54:36.360]  confirmation with official documents official websites and doctors saying no
[54:36.360 --> 54:44.560]  they're definitely there I mean it's ridiculous but it's the same practice
[54:44.560 --> 54:51.480]  it's the same operation that we saw in 2020 where they say there is no Wuhan lab
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.160]  there is no biological research it's not going on it didn't come from a lab it's
[54:56.160 --> 55:02.600]  a wet market it's a batwing yeah oh and and you're gonna get censored and you're
[55:02.600 --> 55:06.880]  gonna get fact-checked if you don't believe in that and then oops that was
[55:06.880 --> 55:15.600]  all wrong and it turns out it was the lab so that's an interesting angle that
[55:15.600 --> 55:21.480]  you're not gonna hear anywhere else and again after what happened see this is
[55:21.480 --> 55:26.160]  what's so frustrated we just we don't live on a real planet we live in the
[55:26.160 --> 55:31.000]  clown world now after what happened with the biological research lab in Wuhan
[55:31.000 --> 55:37.400]  China you think every country considering their drastic measures and emergency
[55:37.400 --> 55:41.120]  response to COVID-19 you think they'd want to shut stuff like this down you
[55:41.120 --> 55:43.800]  think there'd be a bigger initiative worldwide to say hey we don't want
[55:43.800 --> 55:49.000]  another COVID-19 pandemic so it just shows how the whole thing was fake that's
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.440]  really what it shows it shows the whole thing was fake the whole thing was
[55:52.440 --> 55:56.320]  theater they don't really care about COVID they don't really care about viruses
[55:56.320 --> 55:59.760]  they don't really care about stopping the next pandemic in fact I think they
[55:59.760 --> 56:09.720]  want it if you could stop COVID-19 from ever happening would you do it well
[56:09.720 --> 56:17.040]  guess what the origins of COVID-19 are now known as a biological research lab
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.960]  and there's dozens if not hundreds of these still operating doing similar
[56:22.960 --> 56:29.640]  things as the Wuhan lab any given day another virus could get out so
[56:29.640 --> 56:34.800]  maybe rush us thinking hmm having these things on our border with psychotic
[56:34.800 --> 56:40.440]  world criminals running them is probably not a good idea and we can't have to
[56:40.440 --> 56:44.800]  taunt we can't have diplomacy we're not invited at the table to discuss these
[56:44.800 --> 56:48.880]  things so the world can hear our concerns so I mean maybe they'll hear our
[56:48.880 --> 56:56.080]  bombs dropping on Ukraine good approach bad approach I don't know you can
[56:56.080 --> 57:02.800]  decide that's the approach they're taking but see the problem is the world
[57:02.800 --> 57:09.000]  still not listening and so the assault and the aggression from Russia in Ukraine
[57:09.000 --> 57:16.120]  continues but there's a story that I think really kind of puts this all into
[57:16.120 --> 57:25.640]  perspective and I'll have to get to this later today but the Germans seizing the
[57:25.640 --> 57:30.840]  Russian oligarchs yacht some say it's an 800 million 600 million whatever it's
[57:30.840 --> 57:34.960]  like one of the biggest yachts on the planet and and and so they're just
[57:34.960 --> 57:42.000]  stealing Russian's property now folks this is yet again another war of the rich
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.960]  over land and resources
[57:49.440 --> 57:54.240]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info worth

[59:20.360 --> 59:24.520]  health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain
[59:24.520 --> 59:29.080]  after surgery studies have shown as for vitamin C and zinc themselves you

[1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:04.640]  apartment the president was the vice president the last time russia invaded
[1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:08.920]  ukraine this is a pattern of horror from this present from president putin and
[1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:14.880]  from the cronies around him hold on a second guys let's let's just listen to
[1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:21.640]  that one more time did you notice the little slip-up of Jen sake folks Jen
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:27.520]  sake just gave you the whole story she's not a bright she's not a bright gal she
[1:00:27.520 --> 1:00:30.720]  wouldn't have taken this job for the most corrupt administration in u.s. history
[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:35.080]  if she were listen to this one more time and listen to the little slip-up she
[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:39.400]  says where she's admitting that biden is actually causing all this is her this is
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:42.000]  the press secretary admitting biden is causing what's happening in ukraine
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.120]  listening you know i was at the state department the president was the vice
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:50.920]  president the last time russia invaded ukraine this is a pattern of horror from
[1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:56.320]  this present from president putin and from the cronies around him yeah you're
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:02.920]  right this is a pattern of horror from this president biden like i said folks
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:07.240]  you can think putin is the worst guy on the planet if you want you can't ignore
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:14.200]  the facts every time democrats are in the white house they weaken ukraine and put
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:20.320]  them in a more compromised position with russia while also simultaneously
[1:01:20.320 --> 1:01:25.280]  flicking russia in the air giving him a wet willy poking the Russian bear like
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:31.080]  it's a game like all nuclear wars just a game to them haha let's mess with the
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:34.840]  nuclear power of russia that should be fun we'll just bully them they'll never
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:42.880]  do anything hmm really but what is what what is biden doing now folks this is
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:50.520]  again so so bill clinton denuclearizes ukraine and and and makes the lisbon
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:56.280]  agreement where ukraine has to give the nuclear weapons over to russia with the
[1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:59.960]  guarantee that oh america will protect you nato will protect you well i don't
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:05.400]  know how well that's working out for them right now then in the obama
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:11.200]  administration with biden as the vice president obama and soros were running
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:19.160]  proxy groups proxy wars funding terrorists and nazis in ukraine yes
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.720]  folks yes this is the truth i'm sick and damn tired of the media not telling you
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:29.160]  the full story the obama administration was funding proxy wars in eastern
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:38.920]  ukraine with george soros including neo nazi militias and what happened really
[1:02:38.920 --> 1:02:44.920]  they failed is what happened and putin took Crimea but see they installed a
[1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:49.800]  puppet president and they got an anti-russian government in to just make
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:54.360]  things worse and so the situation escalated then trump got in who tried to
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:03:00.600]  make deals kept the piece of the area and wasn't blackmailed or compromised or
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:04.840]  predictable so russia kind of just hit the pause button and said all right
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:08.360]  maybe we can have a talk with trump maybe he's fair he's criticizing nato
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:12.440]  maybe he'll give us a seat at the table and then trump did meet with putin and
[1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:15.800]  trump would have phone calls with putin and even though they tried to impeach it
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:19.000]  on it and call him a russian agent really the president can't talk to another
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.760]  world powers leader that doesn't make sense something sketchy about that but
[1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:28.760]  no it doesn't even stop there so now the biden administration is in office
[1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:33.560]  shuts down our pipelines cuts off our oil production
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:38.040]  gives control of the flow of oil in the west to russia
[1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:41.240]  it's the exact opposite thing you would do
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:45.400]  if you were trying to hurt putin or russia or keep them
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:49.160]  from escalating a conflict in ukraine and by the way
[1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:53.000]  you realize now that the u.s is funding both sides of this war again
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.840]  billions of dollars to ukraine to fight this war and billions of dollars of
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:01.800]  russia to fight this war it's a joke the u.s is funding
[1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:07.400]  both sides of the war in ukraine billions of dollars of russia every week
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:12.440]  for oil because biden shut ours down and then the backing that we're sending to
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:16.120]  ukraine as well so the u.s is funding both sides of this war it's sick
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:23.160]  it's sick but did you know biden pauses new oil and gas leases
[1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:27.800]  amid legal battle over cost of climate change do you know what day this was
[1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:34.120]  this was february 24th do you know what happened on the day that biden
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:37.720]  hurt the us's ability to produce energy and get energy
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:42.040]  do you know what happened that day russia went into ukraine on the exact
[1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:46.200]  same day if anyone is a russian agent
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:49.720]  if anyone is working for vladimir putin it is
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:57.800]  joe biden and the democrat party who are funding both sides of this war
[1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:03.880]  it's hard to believe that we're already into march
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:09.400]  2022 and in the month of february we had a very popular sale that was going
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:13.720]  of our flagship product x3 that has all three types
[1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:16.920]  of the amazing iodine your body needs for every
[1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:20.760]  electrochemical cellular activity in your body
[1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:23.640]  your immune system your stamina your libido
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:26.520]  so much and the majority of the population of the world
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:30.440]  is iodine deficient this is the very best iodine out there so
[1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:34.280]  we had on sale 50% off but we sold more than half of what we have
[1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:37.720]  or isn't going to come in for a long time so i took it back to
[1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:41.160]  full process i was just thinking you know what we need the funds in now to
[1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:43.800]  stay on air plus this is the right product everybody
[1:05:43.800 --> 1:05:47.400]  needs so incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence
[1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:50.680]  get x3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast
[1:05:50.680 --> 1:05:54.040]  i'm going to keep it at 50 off until it sells out
[1:05:54.040 --> 1:06:00.680]  get x3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50 off
[1:06:00.680 --> 1:06:04.840]  we now take you live to the central texas commenced ever
[1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:08.840]  and the heart of the resistance and now your host
[1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:13.560]  Owen Troyer all right we are switching topics now because both of these things
[1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:19.000]  are huge stories i mean you you can try to decide which one's bigger
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:22.680]  the situation in ukraine that's getting worse look i hope it's mostly theater i
[1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:25.960]  don't want to see a nuclear war i don't want to see world war three
[1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:30.520]  but we're following and tracking that but but we can't ignore the fact
[1:06:30.520 --> 1:06:33.400]  because look there's there's different numbers
[1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:36.360]  of casualties that they're saying is happening in
[1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:41.000]  ukraine i've heard anywhere from 500 to 1,000 to 20,000
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:47.960]  who knows folks who knows but even if it is 20,000
[1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:52.920]  the Pfizer vaccine all the covid vaccines have killed more
[1:06:52.920 --> 1:06:59.240]  than the casualties so far in ukraine and so we've got the latest
[1:06:59.240 --> 1:07:02.760]  fiza data which is just so overwhelming to me and that's why i wanted to get the
[1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:06.280]  doctors on today and so dr ben marbles joins me
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:10.200]  now uh ben marbles website is my free doctor
[1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:13.080]  dot com he's been on top of this since day one
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:16.200]  really i mean just totally vindicated with the latest news
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:20.520]  in the fizer data so so dr marbles thank you for joining me
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:27.400]  i'm looking at the fiza data dump which they claim is a three month survey
[1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:30.120]  and i can't even believe i'm reporting this it's like i don't even believe my
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:33.320]  own eyes i don't even believe my own reporting it's just i saw the document
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:37.880]  and according to the document the fizer vaccine had a three percent fatality
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:42.280]  rate and a ninety percent side effect rate
[1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:47.480]  i mean are my eyes lying to me when you saw this and you saw the side effects
[1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:50.440]  what are you thinking how do you interpret this data that fizer has
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:55.160]  finally released that they tried to hide for almost a whole 100 years
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:59.320]  yeah they they tried to have their lawyers not release the data for 75
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:03.160]  years and it just confirms what we've known for a long time now what we've
[1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:07.720]  been saying in that that these fake vaccine
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:11.160]  experimental gene editing poison is poison and
[1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:14.680]  people need to stop taking poison you know if you look at the numbers of that
[1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:17.880]  data i think it was around 45 000 people
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:22.440]  we're in that study and 42 000 reported
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:27.000]  adverse reactions the list of adverse reactions is many pages long
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:33.160]  other than instant death so there's just a mountain of evidence that proves
[1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:36.520]  that these fake vaccines are poison we need to ban the
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:39.080]  damn poison as soon as possible is the bottom line but
[1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:42.600]  you know the bad news is we're going to pass five billion doses of this poison
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:46.280]  delivered in a few weeks later this month we're at like
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:51.000]  4.9 billion right now so the problem is is we've had the greatest
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:55.560]  mass poisoning event in human history so because of that mass poisoning event
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:58.840]  which is ongoing we're going to see more people die
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:02.520]  in the year 2022 than any year in human history and that's why I call it the
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:07.640]  mass die off of 2022 so that you know the
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:10.360]  prospects of that are very scary certainly way more
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:15.400]  deaths from the fake vaccine poison than in Ukraine from the war
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:19.320]  so one has to wonder you know the world economic forum they're the puppet
[1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:23.320]  masters all of all this Putin is in the world economic forum
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:28.200]  is this all just a charade to distract from the mass die off of 2022 and that's
[1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:31.480]  what I think it is they're just trying to smoke screen all these deaths that are
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:34.520]  going to occur this year we're starting to see the insurance
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:38.200]  data is coming in you know all calls mortality is up like 40
[1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:41.640]  percent for the insurance you know when people die they file their insurance
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:44.920]  claim so the insurance companies are blowing the whistle on this
[1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:48.280]  and all the data that's coming out the you know it's just
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:52.040]  irrefutable the mountain of evidence so basically the only people who are
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:55.880]  who ignored at this point or the brainwashed covid cult
[1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:59.560]  members you know that they just keep lining up for the poison they'll just
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:03.720]  keep taking dose after dose it's you know the definition of insanity is
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:07.400]  doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result well by the
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:10.280]  time you're on your third or fourth booster you should
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:13.240]  realize that it doesn't work and that if you just want you know you want to keep
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:17.160]  taking poison then you're basically insane but you know that's the
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:20.600]  definition of it so I just encourage everybody please
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:24.680]  stop taking the poison it it clearly it does not stop infection
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:28.440]  I mean the latest data on the children's shot it only had 11
[1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:33.960]  percent efficacy so children it's all risk no reward
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:37.480]  and that you know to meet the legal definition if it doesn't prevent
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:42.120]  infection in at least 50 of people who get it is legally not a vaccine so
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:46.120]  all the proofs in these fake vaccines are not real vaccine
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:49.800]  they're gene editing technology a study just came out the other day that
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:54.520]  showed the vaccine goes into liver cells and converts the DNA there so it's
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:58.360]  gene editing poison which they of course denied all
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:02.120]  along they just it's just one great big lie after another
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:05.560]  and now all the evidence is coming out and we were proven right that
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:09.800]  this stuff is not safe and effective it's actually killing a lot of people
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:12.600]  and you know we need to ban it as soon as possible because
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:16.360]  everything's just going to keep getting worse until after we ban this poison
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:19.080]  because if you keep just poisoning everybody on the planet
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:24.440]  you know there's a quote it was a I erroneously attributed to the Nazi
[1:11:24.440 --> 1:11:26.840]  Klaus Schwab but it was by another man actually
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:30.360]  and their their target goal he researched world economic form their target
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:33.880]  goal population is one billion from the research this
[1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:38.200]  author did and so you know there's eight billion people on the planet
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:42.440]  that basically means they want to mass murder around seven billion people
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:46.040]  well they've already dosed about five billion people with this slow acting
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:49.400]  poison there's the list it's just a mile long of all these
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:53.720]  different conditions known to be caused by the Pfizer vaccine
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:57.000]  so the fact that this is still on the market
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.920]  is just proof of how corrupt all of our alphabet government agencies are
[1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:03.960]  FDA is totally corrupt CDC is totally corrupt
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:08.840]  you know so at some point the people have to stand up against this and
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:14.760]  you know refuse to take the poison and also stand up and speak out against it
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:18.040]  certainly the truckers are doing a good job with that
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:21.480]  but we have to do whatever it takes to get this poison banned now of course we
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:24.760]  want nonviolent protest we want everybody to remain
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:28.200]  peaceful but we have to get this poison ban that should be priority
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:31.880]  number one for everybody around the world way more important than war and
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:35.560]  anything else that's going on because we're we're witnessing the greatest
[1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:38.520]  mass poisoning in human history right now it's been going on since the
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:42.760]  start of this vaccine program you know in just a short 14 month
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:45.800]  the adverse events reported they're right around two million now and are
[1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:49.400]  over 30 000 deaths that's reported to bears which is just one database for
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:53.880]  one country and it's more than all the real
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:58.040]  vaccines combined you know tetanus vaccine
[1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:01.400]  diphtheria pertussis all the other vaccines that you combine to some total
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:04.600]  of all the adverse event from those over the past four
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:07.400]  decade the adverse events from these fake
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:11.080]  vaccines is higher than all the other real vaccines combined
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:15.400]  in just a short 14 months so that's just completely
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:19.000]  you know how much evidence do people need to pull the poison off the market
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.240]  how many people have to die from this poison
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:24.600]  before we can get it banned and pulled off the market that's what remains to be
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:27.640]  seen because we know it's poison it's very clear it's poison
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:31.080]  and uh people need to stop taking the poison uh
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:34.760]  you know yeah it's like if i was if i was
[1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:38.520]  an evil person or macky vellion i'd say okay you know what
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:42.680]  keep rolling out the poison shot we'll consider this a survival of the fittest
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:45.640]  type thing and uh yeah millions of people might
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:47.800]  die but you know what maybe it's a better thing we get those
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:51.560]  those low IQ people off the planet but no they're innocent they're being lied to
[1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:54.920]  they're being tricked so we can't take that stance
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:14:00.360]  i like the way you put that though this is one way for people to kind of really
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:04.440]  perceive what's happening here we are mass producing
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:10.600]  poison we are mass producing poison and injecting it into people's veins
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:14.520]  right into their bodies now there's a lot of this when i look at the
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:17.160]  the research and the data that's been released there's a lot of this that i
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:20.040]  just have trouble interpreting and that's why i wanted to get you on here
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:23.720]  today um first let's just start and we'll go
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:27.320]  to the break and we'll continue with this what is it i mean
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:31.880]  how do they have like 30 pages of adverse side effects has there ever been
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:36.120]  any medical product that has like a thousand side effects like
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:41.640]  everything in in in encyclopedia have you ever seen anything like that
[1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:46.040]  no sir never in before in history and medicine has this ever happened and
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:50.120]  you know the FDA's own standard is if if there's more than 50 if there's 50 deaths
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:52.120]  they're supposed to pull the drug off the market
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:55.080]  well they passed 50 deaths the first month this was out they should have
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:59.720]  pulled it off the market by february so clearly they're ignoring all the rules
[1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:05.080]  and why is that well it's because the pc commie covid cult members they run all
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:09.000]  the organizations and they're in collusion with the world economic forum
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.760]  to take down america to destroy america usher in their
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:15.960]  pandemic for the great reset in the one world government
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:19.640]  and they're basically actively committing mass genocide in the process
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:22.520]  they know what they're doing the leaders know what's going on now
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:27.720]  the you know the a lot of the people who just follow the leader may not be aware
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:30.840]  of the you know the level of evil that's going on here
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:34.200]  but we have to tell people and let people know what's really happening
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:37.960]  and that's how you know we we tell people the truth of what's really going on and
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:41.960]  and truth will set you free you know the truth comes out eventually and
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.000]  everybody knows everybody knows somebody with a vaccine injury a family
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:48.440]  member or friend uh by now oh everyone i know that took it i mean
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:51.960]  luckily none of them died everyone i know that took it either got sick
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:58.760]  or or had some weird reaction to it we'll be right back don't go anywhere
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:02.440]  it's hard to believe that we're already into march
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:07.960]  2022 and in the month of february we had a very popular sale that was going
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:12.280]  of our flagship product x3 that has all three types
[1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:15.560]  of the amazing iodine your body needs for every
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:19.320]  electrochemical cellular activity in your body

[1:16:22.280 --> 1:16:25.160]  so much and the majority of the population of the world
[1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:29.000]  is iodine deficient this is the very best iodine out there so
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:32.920]  we have on self 50 off but we sold more than half of what we have
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:37.160]  or isn't going to come in for a long time so i took it back to full process i was
[1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:40.760]  just thinking you know what we need the funds in now to stay on air
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:44.440]  plus this is the right product everybody needs so to incentivize
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:47.160]  folks out there that have been on the fence to get x3 and experience it
[1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:51.080]  yourself and support the broadcast i'm going to keep it at 50 off
[1:16:51.080 --> 1:16:56.440]  until it sells out get x3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50
[1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:59.160]  percent off

[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:20.840]  and listen all the products are great but when it comes to high quality

[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:30.920]  getting through the training and then every day now i'm taking
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:35.080]  dr jones sore list i have bad joints thanks mom

[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:01.480]  neh micah california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the wrong tree
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:06.200]  calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014
[1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:10.200]  legislation the u.s government gain of function deliberative process and
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:14.040]  research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:17.400]  involving influenza mers and stars viruses there's nothing about
[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:21.560]  stars like viruses and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:25.160]  it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way intersection there's the
[1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:29.160]  stop sign you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's also it
[1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:32.040]  doesn't pause all gain of function just selected
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:35.880]  gain of function but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and
[1:19:35.880 --> 1:19:40.040]  qualification research so you know rand and others you know maybe fouchy was
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:42.600]  right they don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of
[1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:45.640]  function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been
[1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:48.280]  arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic
[1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:52.120]  life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still
[1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:55.240]  a gain of function you're making something deadly that spreads more
[1:19:55.240 --> 1:19:59.960]  easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you
[1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:04.520]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[1:20:04.520 --> 1:20:08.520]  it's alex jones
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:22.600]  dr marble put it best we are mass producing
[1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:28.280]  poison i mean folks this is like this is unbelievable man it's like i
[1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:31.400]  like we play the mission impossible theme and the james bond themes and all
[1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:35.080]  these things but it's like really we're like in a james bond film
[1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:38.520]  and evil villains are producing poison in mass
[1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:42.760]  for human consumption and here's the here's here's this
[1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:45.320]  the other part about this as you were mentioning before we went to the break
[1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:49.000]  it's it's they're still promoting this dr marble
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.960]  they're still promoting it on television they're still promoting it in
[1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:54.520]  government they're still promoting it in the alphabet agencies
[1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:58.440]  they're even releasing new reports today saying
[1:20:58.440 --> 1:21:02.520]  from the cdc and the surgeon general saying
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:05.800]  we need to combat misinformation when it comes to vaccines
[1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:09.160]  but all the stuff they want to combat quote unquote
[1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:12.920]  has been accurate has has been proven to be true
[1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:17.080]  i mean how is it that they're all in on this so it's just it's just stunning
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:22.440]  but here's my problem is and i'm curious were you as overwhelmed as i was
[1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:26.200]  even as a doctor with the with a better understanding of this were you as
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:30.280]  overwhelmed as i was when you saw the faiza data
[1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:34.760]  and the thousands of deaths and the tens of thousands of adverse reactions
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:39.640]  in a small three month period and then 30 pages of different side effects
[1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:44.600]  i'm looking at this like how how can this even be real how is this even
[1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:48.600]  happening i know it's incredible it's
[1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:51.800]  unbelievable and that's the problem is that people that are brainwashed they
[1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:55.000]  don't want to believe this level of evil exists and uh
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:58.920]  it does it's very real and this just confirms what we knew but
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:02.280]  man the mountain evidence and the proof and that faiza document released this
[1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:07.240]  week is just uh just a ton of evidence it's irrefutable and only people who
[1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:10.520]  don't uh believe at this point that the fake vaccines are
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:13.240]  poisoned or the people that are brainwashed that are
[1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:17.800]  basically uh victims of the mass formation psychosis because of all the
[1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:21.640]  fear porn they're they can't see it and and uh
[1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:25.080]  they're just sheep that probably won't wake up you know you can't wake up
[1:22:25.080 --> 1:22:28.200]  everybody you can try to wake up but let me ask you this though what about the
[1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:32.120]  people that are waking up that took the vaccine and are now
[1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:36.280]  you know kind of scared that this thing was put in them
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:40.200]  uh i mean what what can you say to them what can you say to people
[1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:43.720]  who got one of these vaccines and is maybe scared because of this information
[1:22:43.720 --> 1:22:47.240]  is coming out i mean what is there good news for them is there a way they can
[1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:51.640]  kind of i don't know like detoxify from this
[1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:55.080]  there are uh treatments that can help and that's where you know we do we do
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:58.600]  want to give people the good news and so we've had some big news this week for
[1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:03.320]  myfreedoctor.com we've been two years you know i'll tell you our stats we're
[1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:06.440]  we're around 180 000 free doctor visits delivered
[1:23:06.440 --> 1:23:11.160]  we've had a total of six deaths so that's about one death every 30 000 patients
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:14.920]  uh but the the the six people that died they wouldn't even take the medicine
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:18.360]  but when people take it we've got a 99.99 percent survival
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:23.000]  rate but uh so the proof is is early treatment
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:27.320]  works but now we finally have licenses covering all 50 states so we can also
[1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:31.240]  now deliver free doctor visits for non-covid type problems like
[1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:34.920]  say a headache or an earache or a urinary tract infection or a yeast
[1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:37.800]  infection or one of the most common things that if it's
[1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:41.000]  appropriate for telemedicine we can now handle it all five states
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.920]  free doctor visit for example of medication refills simple things like
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:48.440]  that uh maybe uh men who have erectile dysfunction
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:52.040]  who are taking biogra or psilocyte or out they need a refill we can do that for
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:56.360]  free now we still ask for a donation but we now have the ability to treat non-
[1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:59.240]  covid type health problems that are appropriate for
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:02.360]  telemedicine and if it's something that we can't handle we can refer you to
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:05.800]  doctors that we actually trust because that's the big problem right now
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:09.960]  what we have is had we've had a cowardice uh pandemic across america among
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:13.640]  america's doctors 99 percent are just cowards uh
[1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:16.920]  Fauci doctors that refuse to treat patients when they get sick
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:19.880]  well we have the doctors on our team that will actually treat you when you get
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:22.680]  sick and so if if you have something that we
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:25.880]  can treat by telemedicine then we can deal with it but if we can't handle it
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:29.560]  we can refer you to the doctors that can that we trust doctors that we trust so
[1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:32.840]  we we're building a list of a referral network of
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:37.240]  doctors that you know that are against the poison that are in favor of early
[1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:40.280]  treatment so uh that's another reason why people should
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:45.000]  go ahead and go to myfreedoctor.com and uh with whatever your healthcare
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:48.200]  needs are and uh so basically we're creating a
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:51.560]  parallel system going forward you know two three years from now we want to be
[1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:54.680]  the gateway into healthcare that you get to talk to
[1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:57.960]  healthcare for free and get a free opinion get free
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:25:00.920]  prescriptions you can donate if you want you know and thank god you are
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:04.600]  because we need doctors we can trust because there has been so much lost
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:08.680]  faith in the medical industry and institutions and sadly in doctors but
[1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:11.320]  there are good doctors out there you're you're sourcing them out with your
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:13.720]  website but but let's get back to the side effects
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:17.080]  here because this is one that i'm i'm struggling to understand
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:19.960]  and and there were actually other studies that came out before the Pfizer data
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:23.640]  was released basically they're saying that again this is my layman
[1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:26.680]  interpretation of this so correct me or put me on the right track
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:30.520]  if i'm off here but it sounds to me where they did these
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:33.880]  these in in vitro studies of what it does to the liver
[1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:37.480]  so basically the vaccine the mRNA gets in there
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:41.240]  you have a spike protein machine in your body that's just constantly putting
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:45.240]  out the spike proteins it's rewriting your immune system
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:49.000]  and it's rewriting your dna and it basically
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.520]  now opening you up to any and every disease possible like you've been reset
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:56.520]  as a human and and anything could be possible or i guess maybe the
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:25:59.880]  synthetic dna or whatever they're putting into the vaccine
[1:25:59.880 --> 1:26:03.000]  let's say that that person that the original dna was
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:06.520]  inclined to get this cancer or that disease now the sudden you might be
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:09.640]  inclined to get that am i interpreting this data right what what did those
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:13.320]  studies represent no you're interpreting correctly
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:16.760]  you know the what people don't understand is the spike protein itself
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:20.360]  is the poison it's the self-spreading uh
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:24.040]  bioterror weapon so when you give the shot into your arm
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:28.840]  uh your body starts producing the spike protein throughout your entire body
[1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:31.960]  and that may be for the rest of your life we don't know yet we don't know
[1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:35.640]  maybe that's for six months maybe it's for 20 years we don't know and
[1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:39.320]  not only time we'll tell the answer that but the spike protein itself
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:43.320]  causes all the symptoms of covid and it causes you to have a positive
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:47.720]  covid test result so this is what we see i've heard thousands of cases of this
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:51.080]  oh i was totally healthy i went and got the fake vaccine
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:54.760]  two days later suddenly i'm sick with all the symptoms of covid
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:58.520]  have a positive covid test now here's where they lie with statistics if you
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:02.760]  then get admitted to the hospital and you die less than 14 days after that shot
[1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:05.560]  that's called a covid death and not a vaccine death
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:09.160]  so they're just lying in every way imaginable
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:13.640]  to deceive the people into taking this poison uh so nobody should take poison
[1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:17.800]  not old people young people pregnant people nobody should take it
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:21.160]  you know the reports are the pregnant women the the
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:24.840]  miscarriage rates in pregnant women are some reports are as high as 80 percent
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:27.960]  the miscarriages are going through the roof the cancers are going through the
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:32.040]  roof we're seeing vaccine induced aids basically where it impairs immunity
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:35.400]  long-term you know doc and i've probably told you this before but
[1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:40.840]  dr luke montaña he recently passed away um he was Nobel prize winner and he
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:45.880]  said that he believed 100 of people who even took just one shot of this poison
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:49.800]  would be dead in three years and i tend to agree with him based on everything i've
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:54.360]  read but i hope and pray that i'm wrong uh because many of my family members
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:57.480]  and friends have taken it you know against my recommendations but
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:01.320]  so hopefully we're wrong but certainly there are some treatments uh chlorine
[1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:05.000]  dioxide some people are suggesting that that's not one i personally try but i
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.320]  know some doctors like that one uh ivermectin is another one that
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:12.760]  a lot of patients have said has helped them after vaccine injury
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:16.040]  and there's several other medicines we can try so certainly anybody who has
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:19.480]  vaccine injury or side effect go to myfreedoctor.com we'll hook you up
[1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:23.080]  with one of our doctors and try to do the best we can to help you
[1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:27.000]  through this ultimately long term we have to get this poison banned we got to
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.360]  do whatever it takes to get it banned uh so you know the world economic forum
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:32.840]  leaders they're the orchestrators of all this uh
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:36.120]  ideally they all need to be arrested but how do you arrest them when they own
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:40.040]  all the court system and big pharma owns the
[1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:43.160]  media so they're not going to stab them in the back because they're all working
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:46.120]  together and and we're going to come back one more segment with dr marble here
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:50.520]  and i want to ask him because again folks if there's two deaths in a baby
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:54.600]  formula they pull that baby formula off the shelves i mean by that standard
[1:28:54.600 --> 1:28:59.240]  alone these vaccines should never be injected again
[1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:01.880]  two of our best selling products are back in stock
[1:29:01.880 --> 1:29:05.800]  then fullwarstore.com and they will sell out in the next three four months before
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:09.000]  i get more of the product in if i sell it at full price
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  but i want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:18.440]  or getting x3 to try the products and see how amazing they are and i believe
[1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:21.880]  you will then get hooked on them like myself my family
[1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:25.480]  and the crew are so again both these products are back in stock
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:31.400]  both x3 and winter sun they are 50 off for a limited time because they're going
[1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:35.960]  to sell out at this price i would estimate in less than a month
[1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:39.560]  so this is your chance to get x3 and experience the good halogens or some
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:43.320]  of the bad halogens this is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin d3

[1:29:55.960 --> 1:29:58.680]  it's a match made in heaven

[1:33:30.600 --> 1:33:38.040]  ben marble my free doctor dot com and finishing up here in the last
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:43.560]  segment we have with him again how is it i guess we know how it is it's all the
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:47.720]  corruption but i mean how is there not more of an outrage a baby formula this
[1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:51.560]  just happened this week a baby formula uh has two
[1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:55.080]  casualties because of a baby formula they pull it off the shelves they're not
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:33:57.480]  selling it anymore they'll probably be lawsuits
[1:33:57.480 --> 1:34:02.200]  but the vaccine the covid vaccine tens of thousands of deaths
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:05.800]  hundreds of thousands of adverse reactions we don't even know the long
[1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:09.080]  term numbers yet and they're still promoting it they're still telling you
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:13.160]  it's safe and effective and now the scariest thing to me
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:19.480]  which is the surgeon general and these other corrupt alphabet agencies
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:23.880]  are basically i i think that they're going to reach a point here doctor where
[1:34:23.880 --> 1:34:27.320]  anybody who says anything negative about the vaccine or talks about a wuhan lab
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:29.640]  or a doctor that does it they're going to pull your medical license they're
[1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:32.520]  going to censor you off the internet they may even come try to arrest you with
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:34.840]  this stuff i mean this is just out of control
[1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:40.760]  so i mean as a doctor seeing how they they refuse to pull this off the
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:43.320]  shelves despite the side effects and the deaths
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:46.760]  and then seeing this attacks of the cdc the fda
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:50.200]  the surgeon general saying you're not allowed to question the vaccine you're
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:54.680]  not allowed to question the authorities i mean how dangerous is this i mean this
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:58.120]  is i i'm just stunned that we're we're living through this is the most evil
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:01.480]  maybe even then definitely in my life this is probably the most evil thing
[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:05.400]  that i've ever witnessed i blame it on political
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:10.840]  crackness and this guy right here uh dr death and nazi fouchy uh political
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:13.480]  crackness is the most successful brainwashing
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:16.360]  tool of all time and that's what people need to realize
[1:35:16.360 --> 1:35:20.280]  you know when you know people used to think pc was just good manners but what
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:24.520]  we now find out is it's getting thousands if not millions of people killed
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:27.960]  uh because of political correctness so the problem is is we're living in
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:31.560]  occupied territory now we have a pc kami coveted cult member in the
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:35.400]  white house we all nine u.s supreme court members or
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:38.680]  our pc kami coveted cult members has proven by the fact that all nine took
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:41.800]  the poison allegedly whether they took the real or not is
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:45.400]  debatable and the majority of the members of congress have all taken the
[1:35:45.400 --> 1:35:50.520]  poison so basically we're living under uh pc kami coveted cult rule in america
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:53.320]  right now so we need to take our freedom back
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:57.160]  from these losers we need to round them all up and throw them in
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:35:59.880]  in prison now that's the problem how do you throw them in prison and have them
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:03.000]  arrested when all the all the courts and all are
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:05.960]  corrupt and in the back pocket of world economic form which is why
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:09.400]  what i do is i pray for god to hurry up and return it
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:13.960]  and and let god sort it out and let you know god take care of these people
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:17.480]  uh you know take them to an early graver whatever god decides is
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:22.520]  appropriate um i just pray for that to happen sooner rather than later because
[1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:27.800]  you know what we can do is is nonviolent peaceful protest but we can also pray
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:31.080]  uh that we see an end to this and the more people that pray for that then
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:35.400]  hopefully we you know god will intercede and and
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:38.520]  get this poison banned we need to do whatever it takes to get this poison
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:41.000]  banned and hold these evil doers accountable
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.720]  and they can't get away with this world economic form
[1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:47.160]  you know nazi claus raw bill gates the hell dr death fouchy
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:51.240]  dementia joe i've got a dementia joe doll too uh and you know i come up with
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:54.840]  these names because part of the way you break the broad brainwashing is
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:58.680]  you make fun of them and you mock them i mired in psychology
[1:36:58.680 --> 1:37:01.560]  and that's you can't break through brainwashing
[1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:05.720]  by being nice to people you break through brainwashing by ridiculing them
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:09.080]  making a joke out of their position you know if you're wearing a mask
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:12.680]  you see people wearing a mask make fun of them the masks do nothing they don't
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:16.600]  stop covid all they do is virtue signal the mask are the new swastika
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:20.840]  you know swastika didn't do anything but let other people know hey you are not
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:24.440]  then you remember the party well we're getting the same thing with the mask
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:27.720]  all they do is a virtue signal to tell people you're a compliant brainwash
[1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:31.000]  sheet that you're a member of the pc kami covid cult
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.440]  so take the stupid mask off they don't do anything there goes uh
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:37.640]  ron de sanis we have the i'm in florida we have the best governor in america
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:41.320]  here in florida and a good chance he's going to be a future president now
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:45.160]  what i would say about you know about trump specifically in the vaccine
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:49.320]  trump who's ultimately to blame for the for the fake vaccine poison
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:53.080]  president donald trump is to blame and if he won't come out in
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:56.920]  open league paul for the poison to be banned then his political career is over
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:37:59.960]  as far as i'm concerned i'm the biggest trump supporter you'll meet
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:03.960]  uh i mean i i run the president donald trump page on facebook i made that in
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:06.360]  2015 a year before he was elected president
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:10.520]  then a huge trump supporter but his by far his biggest mistake in his
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:14.040]  presidency was delivering this poison onto the masses
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:17.720]  into the world and uh if he won't come out against it
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:21.640]  then uh i'm not going to support him no i completely agree there needs to be a
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:24.440]  reconciliation thing here from trump
[1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:28.680]  and and i'm i'm i'm willing to say hey look you know people make mistakes and
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:31.800]  and sometimes they double and triple down on those mistakes but
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:34.920]  this point it's not a mistake at this point there's no excuse
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:38.280]  uh and and you know what we will forgive and forget and we can have a
[1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:41.720]  reconciliation period but it definitely needs to be addressed because i know
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:44.440]  that there's people where it stands right now they're just simply not going to
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:48.440]  vote for trump on this one issue alone and and and yourself and me who have
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:52.120]  been avid trump supporters i'll definitely be looking uh elsewhere as
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:55.640]  well if if he doesn't stop promoting this vaccine is safe and effective
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:59.560]  and pounding his chest like it was a victory for him
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:03.480]  correct absolutely because you know it's clearly poisonous in
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:06.760]  uh harming a lot of people killing a lot of people ruining a lot of people's
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:12.440]  lives and so he needs a own it accept responsibility for it apologize and
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:15.960]  america would forgive him if he doesn't do that
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:19.000]  i won't forgive him you know if you if you can't admit you were wrong and say
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.800]  you were wrong and and and and and apologize and and and call for the
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:26.440]  point you know he could call for the poison to be banned tomorrow and that
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:29.960]  would do a tremendous amount to get this poison banned because we all know it's
[1:39:29.960 --> 1:39:33.400]  poison all the doctors know it's poison anybody who's paying attention knows
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:37.240]  it's poison he has to know it's poison by now there's no way he can pretend he
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:40.360]  doesn't know it by now yeah let's how about that how about with now that we
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:44.280]  have the Pfizer data that they tried to keep secret for an entire century
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:47.560]  what about doctors that were maybe on the fence or maybe even promoting the
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:50.840]  vaccine i mean what about them are they not realizing
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:53.880]  what's going on are they still doubling down on the lies i mean how do you how
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:58.920]  do you how do you understand that i will say this
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:01.160]  you know i'm one of the only doctors you'll probably talk to this never
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:05.000]  recommended a single dose of the poison for a single patient that's because i
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.200]  was trained in my residency you should never recommend a new drug until it's
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:10.840]  been on the market for three years because that's when you find out it's
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:14.680]  actually dangerous or not and the fact that they put it out in nine months when
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:18.040]  prior to that the fastest the vaccine had been made was four years
[1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:21.800]  and you know fast science is always bad science so it was a pretty easy call for
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:25.160]  me to say no i sent out a message to all of our
[1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:28.440]  patients do not take this it's probably bad and unhealthy
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:31.480]  we'll reassess the data in six months and if it looks like i was wrong that i'll
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:34.520]  say go ahead and take it but six months later of course i wasn't
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:38.840]  wrong it's killing thousands of people so we just need to ban the poison but
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:42.040]  you know trump has to do something to speak out against this he's not he's
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:45.880]  trying to wiggle around it but there's no way to wiggle around this it
[1:40:45.880 --> 1:40:49.640]  clearly poisonous he needs the call for it to be banned immediately and people
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:53.320]  would really rally behind him if he would do that
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:57.720]  you know uh so i would say the same about ron de sanis he needs to come out
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:02.440]  against the poison as well um you know a lot of you know politicians are
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:05.400]  politicians and they don't want to ruffle feathers and make people angry
[1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:09.160]  but when when the poisoning is ongoing every day
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:13.400]  uh yeah great it's great to stop mandates and it's great to stop mask
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:17.160]  wearing but if you ban the mandate and people are still being poisoned you're
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:19.560]  not stopping the poisoning the mass genocide
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:23.640]  and it's so obvious now it is so obvious now i mean they had us completely
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:28.200]  panic shutting everything down over a virus that has a less than one percent
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:33.240]  chance of catching it or or it being fatal we now know with the data the
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:39.000]  vaccine has a higher fatality rate than the virus itself that is now a
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:44.120]  scientific fact according to the vaccine manufacturer's own data
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:47.640]  and it's ironic that trump himself was quoted multiple times as saying
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:50.840]  oh we can't the cure can't be worse than the disease
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:54.200]  well lo and behold the cure that trump gave us is far worse than disease
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:57.880]  so trump needs to apologize to america i would really appeal to him to do that
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:42:00.920]  i know i would forgive him and i think most people would forgive him i would be
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:04.280]  more than happy to meet with him in person and talk to him about this
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:08.360]  to try and convince them because i think it would do wonders to getting the
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:11.640]  poison banned sooner rather than later because that's
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:15.720]  it's not a question if it's a question to win if it's going to be banned it's
[1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:19.000]  inevitable that the poison will be banned it's just how many people have to die
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:22.120]  before it's banned is the question now i would like to
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:25.240]  say one other thing you know myfreedoctor.com we are a

[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:57.480]  thank you for your bravery and and just just let's hope we can win this
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:03.800]  has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:08.520]  then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die
[1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:12.600]  no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:19.480]  on populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship and now
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:22.200]  across the world from the united states to europe
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:27.800]  legislation is being introduced that if you amplify
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:34.520]  any quote pro-russian information you can be censored you can be arrested
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:38.760]  you can be imprisoned and of course now canada is under this legislation
[1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:43.560]  that if you have a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:46.920]  engage in hate speech online that you will be
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:50.920]  censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:53.560]  being carried out by the globalists around the world
[1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:57.720]  against humanity that makes them more important than ever
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:44:00.600]  the purpose of fear is to call us into action
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:04.280]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:07.640]  has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:11.400]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:14.600]  asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:18.360]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80 percent of the population
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:21.400]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind
[1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:25.560]  in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:28.520]  we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:32.440]  unsettling to see but there is only two things to do
[1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:35.560]  we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:38.840]  if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win
[1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:42.840]  but even when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience
[1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:46.120]  are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:49.960]  get up to a year's worth of storable foods water filtration
[1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:55.080]  survival gear seeds shortwave radios and life-saving knowledge
[1:44:55.080 --> 1:44:59.640]  at infoorstore.com so when i first started taking survival
[1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:03.960]  shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:06.680]  wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:10.200]  and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:14.200]  was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then
[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:16.920]  shortly thereafter you came out with that shield you had you know with a deep
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:19.800]  burdened source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it
[1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:25.160]  and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:29.320]  was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again
[1:45:29.320 --> 1:45:33.400]  and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:36.600]  religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:40.280]  absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it'll
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:43.640]  literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:47.480]  anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of
[1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:51.320]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:53.960]  our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you
[1:45:53.960 --> 1:45:57.320]  so much for your call and godspeed

[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:08.360]  also crash the dollar in a long run and bring in a new global
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:12.120]  digital currency and all of this russia garbage is smoke screening
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:15.880]  from the documents coming out that madonna and feiser knew

[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:53.160]  uh... just uh... a few hours ago
[1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:58.040]  jerry comrades i would like to say that the special military operation
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:03.320]  is unfolding according to schedule according to the plan
[1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:08.360]  all the goals set by us has been
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:12.760]  achieved the defense ministry is going to give a more detailed report about that
[1:51:12.760 --> 1:51:15.480]  mr shego please
[1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:19.880]  and i will never renounce from my statement that russian and ukrainian
[1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:24.040]  are the same people even though the people from ukraine
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:28.840]  were intimidated or brainwashed by the nazi propaganda
[1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:34.360]  and some of them even decided to follow the bandera ideals or other
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:39.560]  nazi collaborators who fought on the hitler's side during great patriotic
[1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:42.280]  war and the fact that we are fighting against new
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:46.120]  nazis is proved by how the hostilities are going
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:50.520]  nationally the new nazi the units that are
[1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:53.640]  using foreign mercenaries from the middle east
[1:51:53.640 --> 1:52:00.280]  also they use civilians as human shields hiding behind their backs
[1:52:00.280 --> 1:52:04.360]  and we have facts we have pictures of how they deploy
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:09.400]  heavy weapons in the residential areas of their cities
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:12.360]  mortar guns they put their tanks they put their
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:16.360]  cannons and they are taking foreign citizens hostage
[1:52:16.360 --> 1:52:21.720]  thousands of young people students who were starting in ukraine colleges so
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:26.280]  for more than one day they kept
[1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:30.760]  three more than three thousand indian citizens at the train station in harkiv
[1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:36.600]  and they continue keeping them there including 576 people in
[1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:40.360]  the city of sumi new nazis opened fire
[1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:44.040]  on chinese students who wanted to leave harkiv two of them
[1:52:44.040 --> 1:52:50.920]  were wounded once again hundreds of foreigners want to leave the
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:54.680]  hostility zone but they are not allowed to do that basically
[1:52:54.680 --> 1:52:58.840]  they are taking prisoners trying to delay
[1:52:58.840 --> 1:53:01.800]  their leave or they want to evacuate them via
[1:53:01.800 --> 1:53:05.240]  lvov to poland to travel across the entire
[1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:11.080]  area of hostilities thus risking their lives now in the ukrainian land our
[1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:15.800]  soldiers and officers are fighting for russia for a peaceful life for the
[1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:20.760]  people of donbass to denazify and demilitarize ukraine so that no
[1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:24.120]  anti-russia that has been created by the west next
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:29.080]  to our borders didn't threaten us with nuclear weapons as well as it was
[1:53:29.080 --> 1:53:34.280]  happening recently our people is proud of our armed forces
[1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:38.680]  we will always remember our fallen brothers
[1:53:38.680 --> 1:53:43.880]  comrades we will do everything to support their families their children to
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:48.440]  educate them to support their close one and loved ones
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:53.560]  so let's honor the memory of our soldiers who died during this special
[1:53:53.560 --> 1:53:57.960]  military service for the minute of silence
[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:02.520]  and to all those who are dying because of this
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:06.840]  you know we shouldn't be dealing with this on the planet anymore it's the
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:11.320]  21st century i i i really feel that um
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:14.920]  there's going to be a new age after this i think it's going to be a an age of
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:19.880]  peace but uh it's going to be uh
[1:54:19.880 --> 1:54:22.920]  a serious struggle to get to that point because here's the deal i don't think
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:25.640]  the russian troops want to be involved in this war
[1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:27.960]  i don't think the ukrainian people want to be involved in this war there's
[1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:30.760]  gaslighting going on there's encouraging and the violence going on
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:33.240]  there's a lack of understanding of the situation
[1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:37.000]  but that's why you see ukrainians and russians you know that are in military
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:41.400]  gear out in the streets just kind of talking laughing it up and
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:46.440]  this is this is a this is a war of the elites this is a war of the rich and
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:50.840]  powerful fought for by the poor over land and
[1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:55.800]  resources and putin is just making his
[1:54:55.800 --> 1:54:59.480]  case of why he's engaged in this and what's what's
[1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:03.560]  what's the what's the ukrainian or the western back defense is oh just putin's
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:07.320]  a madman he's bad we need to get putin
[1:55:08.200 --> 1:55:10.920]  well
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:15.240]  you can believe whether putin is being honest if the thing is on schedule if
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:18.760]  everything is going according to plan i mean one one side says russia's
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:21.080]  winning the other side says ukraine is winning
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:27.720]  really nobody's winning and and but you see when you start seeing
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:31.960]  russian oligarchs yachts getting seized in germany
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:35.000]  that should really tell you what's going on folks
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:41.080]  this is the this is the petty elites oh we're going to take your boat
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:44.920]  i mean how how how is that even legal
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:51.400]  so it's just and here's what it is too they all know about the corruption
[1:55:51.400 --> 1:55:54.840]  biden knows about russian corruption and oligarchs russian oligarchs know
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:58.920]  about biden's family corruption the clinton's all of it
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:02.680]  i mean they all know they're they're all on the rich rich elite
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:08.120]  political level they all know about all the corruption
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:11.240]  and and so that's why they're like oh we know this guy he's got his yacht in
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:16.600]  germany let's go seize that yacht let's send a message
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:19.640]  it's the rich elite that want to conquer the world
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:25.400]  fighting for land and resources and oil just as it seems to always be
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:30.120]  and the people of the planet that want nothing to do with its suffer
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:42.600]  and by the way that is a tactic that cia front proxy groups
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:48.200]  and western backed proxy groups engage in they do it in syria they do it in
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:52.520]  afghanistan they did they did in iraq and they just say oh it's
[1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:56.760]  it's it's it's moderate rebels and and we give them arms and we give them weapons
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:56:59.320]  and it's moderate rebels and then the next day it's isis
[1:56:59.320 --> 1:57:03.640]  go figure they're just playing the west off like a like a fool
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:07.240]  but no what they do is they take their weapons they hide them in school
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:10.040]  buildings they take their troops they hide them and
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:13.240]  station them in school buildings and then they say no you're not going to
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:16.040]  stop going to school here you're going to come to school here we're just going
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:20.280]  to basically going to hold you hostage and that's what they're doing
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:24.040]  and that's what putin was saying that's going on
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:26.520]  but you're not allowed to hear about that in the western media
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:29.880]  you're not allowed to hear about any of that
[1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:37.800]  but that's the truth so i mean i guess i guess russia could just let
[1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:41.960]  nato continue to expand and put a gun to russia's head and choke russia out of
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:46.760]  the world economy i guess that would be russia's other option
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:52.920]  alex jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars

[2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:07.160]  let me just put this one simply
[2:00:07.720 --> 2:00:11.560]  joe biden is a bigger threat to the united states
[2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:17.000]  than vladimir putin the world economic forum
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:20.600]  the great reset is a bigger threat to the united states
[2:00:20.600 --> 2:00:26.440]  than vladimir putin now corrupt western elites trying to start a
[2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:31.560]  nuclear war with russia could become an issue when
[2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:35.560]  then putin because a larger problem but that would simply be because of the
[2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:39.640]  be because of the actions of our elite
[2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:44.040]  picking a fight with vladimir putin that you don't want that i don't want
[2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:47.560]  but i guess they've brainwashed some america wanting a nuclear war with russia
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:50.920]  just like they brainwashed them into taking a deadly vaccine
[2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:54.600]  it's all the same group it's all the same propaganda
[2:00:54.600 --> 2:00:59.240]  but america is starting to see the light here and i got to be honest i'm
[2:00:59.240 --> 2:01:02.200]  glad that this is happening in a quicker cycle now
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:05.160]  where it really took about two years for people to kind of figure out and
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:08.680]  accept the truth about covid and the vaccines
[2:01:08.680 --> 2:01:12.440]  but they're even you saw some of the same people that understood the fake news
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:15.000]  during the trump years and everything falling for all the propaganda
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:18.520]  folks they're starting to back off take a breath and and realize wait a second
[2:01:18.520 --> 2:01:21.960]  we've been duped again here and so i believe we have the clip ready of
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:27.320]  sake today right guys folks you have to understand
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:30.840]  biden gave putin the leverage he needed to start this war
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:34.280]  every time the last three democrat administrations they've put ukraine in a
[2:01:34.280 --> 2:01:39.720]  more compromised position in regards to russia
[2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:45.320]  and that's the clinton's that's the obamas and and biden and now biden
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:49.000]  again and we are funding both sides of this
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:52.680]  war we're sending billions of dollars every day for russian oil because biden
[2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:57.320]  shut our oil down literally the day of
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:01.880]  putin's invasion biden pauses new oil and gas leases amid legal battle over
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:05.640]  cost of climate change i mean if anybody's a russian
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:09.160]  agent it's biden so the media is starting to figure this out
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:11.960]  gen sake is being forced to answer these questions
[2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:15.960]  and uh... boy she's nowhere near up to the task and but but here it was during
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:19.160]  the press conference today with gen sake
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:23.400]  you just said that you know less supply raises prices it's not in our strategic
[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:27.240]  interest to reduce the supply we also know you know the president
[2:02:27.240 --> 2:02:31.000]  as recently as yesterday talked about increasing domestic manufacturing to
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:35.080]  bring down prices on uh... inflated items like goods
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:38.760]  so why not apply the same logic to energy and
[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:44.040]  increase domestic production here well there are nine thousand approved oil
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:47.720]  leases that the oil companies are not tapping into currently so i would ask
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:51.640]  them that question is there nothing that the administration can do to get
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:56.040]  those providers back to pre-pandemic levels do you think the oil companies
[2:02:56.040 --> 2:02:59.160]  don't have enough money to drill on the places that have been praised oh there
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:02.920]  it is blame the oil companies i would i would point that question to them and
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:05.480]  we can talk about it more tomorrow when you learn more do you think that
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:10.520]  opening the keystone i mean that that is that is unbelievable
[2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:14.440]  i'm just fuming hey this is the presidential
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:18.920]  press secretary press conference you're supposed to answer these questions
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:25.080]  she's balking i i'm just play i'm just play the clip
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:28.200]  having more energy-friendly policies might do that
[2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:31.800]  the keystone pipeline has never been operational it would take years for that
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:34.200]  to have any impact it's a lot you know a number of
[2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:38.040]  members of congress have suggested that but that is a proposed solution that
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:41.640]  has no relationship or would have no impact on what the problem is we hear
[2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:45.400]  that is just a bull-faced lie during those years where it would
[2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:49.160]  you know take to bring down prices as you're saying we should just continue to
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:53.000]  buy rational oil well again jackie i think you're familiar with a number of
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  steps we've taken a historic release from the strategic petroleum reserve
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.880]  what we can do that again by the way they just released more of our reserve
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:03.160]  and what this is all that'll be great if we go to war president's view is our
[2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:07.720]  need to reduce our reliance on oil the europeans need to do that we need to
[2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:12.520]  do that if we do more to invest in clean energy oh my god we're doomed man of
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:15.160]  energy that's exactly what we can do to prevent this
[2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:18.040]  from happening in the future we welcome any republicans from joining us and
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:19.960]  pause it again i'm gonna have to come back to this
[2:04:19.960 --> 2:04:24.360]  imagine she says green energy is the is the solution
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:29.640]  but oil isn't when we have no proof that green energy will do a damn thing
[2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:33.160]  and we have all the proof that the oil will i mean folks that's what we see
[2:04:33.160 --> 2:04:36.360]  here's the media like oh like opening their eyes
[2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:39.880]  like oh like growing up like wait a second we're funding both sides of the
[2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:42.920]  war wait a second we're buying Russian oil wait a second you shut down our
[2:04:42.920 --> 2:04:45.560]  energy why aren't you turning it back on this doesn't make any sense
[2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:51.560]  and sake just sits up there and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies
[2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:54.600]  this is on we have the most corrupt administration in the history of this
[2:04:54.600 --> 2:04:57.480]  country it's not even close
[2:04:59.560 --> 2:05:03.240]  it's hard to believe that we're already into march
[2:05:03.240 --> 2:05:08.920]  2022 and in the month of february we had a very popular sale that was going of
[2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:14.520]  our flagship product x3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine
[2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:19.320]  your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your
[2:05:19.320 --> 2:05:23.000]  body your immune system your stamina your libido
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.880]  so much and the majority of the population of the world
[2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:29.800]  is iodine deficient this is the very best iodine outcome so
[2:05:29.800 --> 2:05:33.640]  we had on sale 50% off but we sold more than half of what we have
[2:05:33.640 --> 2:05:37.080]  or isn't going to come in for a long time so i took it back to
[2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:40.520]  full process i was just thinking you know what we need to funds in now to
[2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:43.800]  stay on air plus this is the right product everybody needs
[2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:47.480]  so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get x3 and
[2:05:47.480 --> 2:05:50.040]  experience it yourself and support the broadcast
[2:05:50.040 --> 2:05:53.400]  i'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out

[2:06:19.480 --> 2:06:23.400]  brian artist who is uh traveling right now but still
[2:06:23.400 --> 2:06:27.000]  doing us the honor of joining us on the air here on the alex joneshow because i
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:29.800]  just said look i i got to get all these doctors that pretty much predicted all
[2:06:29.800 --> 2:06:33.320]  the vaccine stuff back on the air to respond
[2:06:33.320 --> 2:06:37.160]  to the faiza data dump and and dr brian artist has been one of the most
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:40.680]  on point when it comes to all of this and so glad he can join us today from
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:43.240]  the airport so if you do hear some background noise folks just understand
[2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:45.400]  he's in the middle of traveling but still joining us today
[2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:51.720]  uh dr artist i got just like you i'm sure saw the faiza document released that
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:55.720]  they tried to cover up for a century thank god a judge made him release it
[2:06:55.720 --> 2:06:58.840]  and and i i don't have the medical background or understand medical
[2:06:58.840 --> 2:07:04.200]  literature as well as you do but even i looked at this and said wow this is
[2:07:04.200 --> 2:07:08.600]  this is really really bad even worse than we thought
[2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:13.560]  whether it's 30 pages of side effects or whether it's admitting that it rewrites
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:16.760]  your immune system basically rewrites your dna so
[2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:21.000]  dr artist uh your first response to the faiza data dump
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  when it comes to the covet vaccines and and just how do you translate all this
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:30.200]  information uh to to a layman like myself well oan
[2:07:30.200 --> 2:07:34.440]  now it's great to see you and i hope your audience is excited about life at the
[2:07:34.440 --> 2:07:37.480]  moment let's talk about this dump i thought the
[2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:40.920]  fda i thought the fda was completely
[2:07:40.920 --> 2:07:45.000]  uh showing its hand october 22nd 2020
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:48.440]  put out slides seen of the 25 page visitation
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:52.040]  and all the side effects expected to be reported to the government
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:57.560]  there was a list of 22 bullet points that represented about 110 diseases
[2:07:57.560 --> 2:08:01.880]  well now we released just this week there's over 30 pages
[2:08:01.880 --> 2:08:07.400]  of like font size three or four i couldn't believe the amount of
[2:08:07.400 --> 2:08:11.160]  published known side effects from the Pfizer shots i had no idea it would be
[2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:14.120]  that many we know it's going to be astronomical these are
[2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:17.400]  extremely dangerous we've been trying to warn people from the beginning
[2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:21.000]  now we know why it was they wanted to put this off for decades to release the
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:23.800]  evidence uh that they actually are now publishing
[2:08:23.800 --> 2:08:26.840]  and thank god that there was a judge that actually had them
[2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:30.280]  the fortitude to push this out to give us the informed consent we needed
[2:08:30.280 --> 2:08:33.640]  to make a decision around these shots it's very disturbing
[2:08:33.640 --> 2:08:37.320]  i mean i i just like to make analogies or sports analogies because i've
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:39.160]  a sports background i think people understand it
[2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:43.720]  i mean this would be like saying hey um give me a list of your favorite
[2:08:43.720 --> 2:08:47.560]  nfl football players and then you gave them a list of every football player
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:51.240]  that's ever played in the nfl it that's what i mean is there a
[2:08:51.240 --> 2:08:54.200]  disease that's not on the side effect list i mean i feel like it would be
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:58.600]  easier to list the diseases that aren't a side effect
[2:08:58.600 --> 2:09:02.200]  now i used to talk about this early on it's october of 2020
[2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:05.800]  that when they put one bullet point on their fda documentation
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:10.600]  where the shots came out that auto immune diseases was listed as a category
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:13.800]  i actually would tell people you know that one bullet point represents
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:17.960]  80 different diagnosable auto immune diseases i thought that was a lot
[2:09:17.960 --> 2:09:21.960]  but when you see 30 pages of i don't even count them
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:25.160]  it's a ridiculous amount of side effects nobody should be interesting
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:28.840]  these shots to go to anybody i do want to say this oh and on the show today
[2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:33.320]  did you see yesterday after this has been published by fizer
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:36.440]  did you see the panel that was put together by the white house just
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:39.720]  yesterday to talk about covid and what the new
[2:09:39.720 --> 2:09:43.880]  covid pandemic guidelines steps are going to be taking
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:48.200]  did you see this the covid response person for the white house
[2:09:48.200 --> 2:09:52.120]  actually said yesterday that they are now putting in place measures
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:56.120]  his name is zinz he says finally we're touching upon
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:10:00.680]  vaccinating quote vaccinated in the whole world saying that the u.s would not
[2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:04.120]  only be providing more vaccines to other countries but also
[2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:08.120]  vaccinators to that field and then fouchi went on to say
[2:10:08.120 --> 2:10:11.960]  that they are now developing a pro a pro-grow a procedure
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:17.640]  that will allow them to create new covid-19 vaccines for any future variants
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:25.000]  in less than a hundred days per vaccine uh this is extremely terrifying
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.880]  actually that they are recognizing and have published now
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:31.000]  fizer's documentation that there are hundreds if not
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:34.120]  thousands of side effects and diseases being caused by this
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:39.080]  these fizer mRNA technology shots and now just the few days later
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:41.800]  fouchi's going to come out and say we're now going to be improving and putting
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:45.640]  into in place measures that allow us to create new
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:50.280]  novel vaccines for all future variants in less than a hundred days
[2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:53.560]  this is the result of the fizer shots like you see on the screen
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:56.040]  that came from a result of creating vaccines
[2:10:56.040 --> 2:10:59.720]  over nine and 10 months with operation warp speed
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:02.440]  you can see the horrific side effects look at this
[2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:05.960]  it's insane what is occurring to young athletes around the world
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:09.480]  on football fields at record numbers people dying as you're seeing on the
[2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:11.960]  stage here and as you're seeing on the media
[2:11:11.960 --> 2:11:14.840]  and then you have anthony fouchi coming out and say we're going to actually
[2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:18.280]  speed it up we actually now have the ability to create vaccines for future
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:21.000]  variants that we don't even know are coming but they said they have produced
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.160]  a covid-19 variant playbook quote from yesterday
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:28.280]  they have a playbook of variants that they're actually projected to come out
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:31.320]  and now they're going to come up with shots every hundred days they can come
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:34.040]  out with a new shot so i would not be trusting any of these
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:36.920]  shots i would be extremely disturbed and when just when you think there might
[2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:40.760]  be this lull with the amachron variant supposedly
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:44.280]  you're not hearing as much of hospitalizations and deaths right now
[2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:48.200]  you would not expect at least i wouldn't to see anthony fouchi come out
[2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:52.360]  just yesterday saying we're now going to authorize and set up protocols and the
[2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:55.400]  ability to create new covid-19 novel shots
[2:11:55.400 --> 2:11:59.400]  within a hundred days of every variant this is very scary
[2:11:59.400 --> 2:12:03.560]  very unwarranted and then walinsky from the cdc i just want to touch on this
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:06.920]  if you didn't see this one of the measures they now said they're going to
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:12.120]  take they've now increased their water surveillance program for covid-19
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:18.760]  from 400 sites to over 647 and they say they're doing this to be
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:23.960]  able to alert the public that there is in the water as we shed sars
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:27.400]  covid-2 in communities they're actually pcr testing your
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:30.440]  wastewater in your cities and they say they're looking for sars
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:34.360]  covid-2 and when they find it they say the amount of sars
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:39.000]  covid-2 being shed in the feces as their pcr testing our wastewater in our
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:44.040]  cities they can then determine that within four to five days when
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:47.160]  they see elevations of sars covid-2 in our wastewater
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:50.440]  they can now predict there's going to be an outcome or outbreak in your
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:53.560]  community the only problem with that if you're
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:58.120]  shedding out the virus in your feces that's because it already went through
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:01.000]  the person's body and was shed these people are going to be getting sick
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:05.080]  after the fact i would be very leery of what the cdc is doing
[2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:08.680]  we already know the history of adding fluoride in water which we know is a
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:12.680]  we know is toxic and can cause cancer why in the world
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:16.840]  would we be okay knowing that they're adding additional surveillance sites
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:21.320]  around this country targeting 37 specific cities
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:25.480]  i would be looking into that and if you ever wonder if this is accurate info
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:30.440]  go to cdc.gov's covid data tracker on the left hand side you'll see a
[2:13:30.440 --> 2:13:33.720]  little tab that says water surveillance systems and then ask
[2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:36.920]  yourself why is the cdc testing our water why are they telling us that when
[2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:41.320]  they find high levels of sars covid-2 supposedly from a faulty pcr test
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:45.080]  sampling your poop water why would they be telling you they expect
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:48.440]  after finding it in your wastewater to be able to alert the public that there's
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:52.120]  a coming outbreak of sars covid-2 or some other
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:54.680]  variant i wouldn't trust it i don't trust any of it i don't
[2:13:54.680 --> 2:13:58.440]  trust the cdc the nih or the fda none of it and all of them on that panel
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:01.880]  together just showing more and more obvious their hand that they are not
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:04.840]  going to let this covid pandemic go and they're going to come up with ways
[2:14:04.840 --> 2:14:09.000]  to continue to push this narrative and try to put fear
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:12.760]  coercion and bullying just to get them to their agenda which is to mass
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:16.520]  vaccinate the whole world and the covid white house
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:20.280]  correspondent for covid relief just said last night
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:24.840]  their goal is to vaccinate the entire world and the united states
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:28.520]  is set in prime to vaccinate and create the vaccines
[2:14:28.520 --> 2:14:32.120]  and then supply the vaccinators to the whole world
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:35.960]  like they're going to send our people with new shots they're creating within
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:38.600]  a hundred days and injecting people around the world
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:41.560]  because the end game is to vaccinate them all and then your question has got
[2:14:41.560 --> 2:14:44.840]  to be what's the intent after two years or a year and a half now you know the
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:46.520]  vaccines aren't proven safe and effective
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:50.360]  look at Pfizer's document that just came out well and this is full spectrum so
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:53.080]  not only do they get to cling to the pandemic forever
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:56.120]  they get to push vaccines into your veins forever they get they get to have
[2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:01.160]  their cake and eat it too look i don't want to get too conspiratorial
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:05.320]  here but i mean folks this is like an alien takeover and this is just a joke
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:09.080]  this is so anti-human look i'm not some i don't talk about paranormal or
[2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:11.800]  aliens or anything like that i mean i you know i'll talk about like demonic
[2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:13.400]  possession every once in a while but seriously
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:17.240]  i mean we're reaching like they live under the skin
[2:15:17.240 --> 2:15:21.000]  levels like this is so anti-human how can anybody
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:27.240]  how can the vaccine according to their own data is more deadly than the virus
[2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:30.520]  how can we continue this unless the goal is to kill people
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:34.440]  i can't make sense of it any other way doctor artist
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:37.720]  no this is a mass genocide i don't know if you guys have been following or been
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:42.040]  making sure your audience is aware of dr ranier full makes grand jury
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:45.560]  that he's put together he's got a five-day series of experts that okay yeah
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:48.360]  this is big let's pause right there because we got to take a break let's
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:52.120]  come back with that grand jury folks i'm telling you look i'm not saying it's
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:55.000]  aliens or demons but how do you make sense of this how do you make sense of
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  this anti-human behavior has been noted by many a
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:05.720]  historian the first casualty of war is the truth then the next big casualty
[2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:10.520]  isn't even the people that die no that invariably follows
[2:16:10.520 --> 2:16:14.440]  but first there is the crackdown on populations
[2:16:14.440 --> 2:16:18.760]  basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:22.120]  and now across the world from the united states to europe
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:26.280]  legislations being introduced that if you
[2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:33.000]  amplify any quote pro russian information you can be censored
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:36.680]  you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now
[2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:40.200]  canada's under this legislation that if you have a
[2:16:40.200 --> 2:16:44.440]  fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:48.600]  in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested
[2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:51.880]  ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is being carried out by the
[2:16:51.880 --> 2:16:55.000]  globalists around the world against humanity that makes them
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:17:04.600]  fours dot com more important than ever
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:08.600]  great last caller i just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement

[2:17:57.320 --> 2:17:59.800]  with the world awakening i think what's important that we were right though
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:02.840]  to prevent them right now take advantage of this moment and i have all of an
[2:18:02.840 --> 2:18:06.040]  idea that something everybody can do with every listener can do i think it'd
[2:18:06.040 --> 2:18:09.400]  be powerful and effective for us to uh you know hang banners over
[2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:12.120]  highways imagine a champion artist in a layup
[2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:14.840]  man it says alex jones is right in the war stop
[2:18:14.840 --> 2:18:17.960]  farm where we stand with the truckers or rest out or whatever it's
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:20.440]  brother i'm so glad you called elaborate on this
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:23.720]  yes now is the time in your small town or your big city
[2:18:23.720 --> 2:18:27.000]  to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:31.480]  or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction
[2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:34.680]  what do you recommend people say on these banner hangs i have a few ideas
[2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:37.560]  first of all alpha just before you fall into a form
[2:18:37.560 --> 2:18:40.520]  rest out rest while swab the vaccine is poison there's
[2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:43.640]  kinds of things i say just keep it short keep it concise i don't agree
[2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:48.200]  arrest Fauci arrest bill gates the covet backs is poison beautiful yeah there's
[2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:51.000]  ways that we could all be involved if we could all be affected so
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.520]  that's what i'm calling about god bless you chris in Atlanta i really really
[2:18:54.520 --> 2:18:57.640]  appreciate you calling us today thank you so much
[2:18:57.640 --> 2:19:01.720]  the globalist social engineers always intended to push
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:07.400]  their covet biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations
[2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:12.360]  rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and
[2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:15.880]  banning and arresting anybody that speaks out
[2:19:15.880 --> 2:19:19.720]  against their lives but because of so many scientists and engineers and
[2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:23.880]  researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:28.120]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:32.200]  that it is a world government corporate takeover
[2:19:32.200 --> 2:19:35.560]  and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever
[2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:38.920]  the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:42.520]  on their takeover like canada with a doubt declared
[2:19:42.520 --> 2:19:45.960]  a civil emergency and martial law in ontario
[2:19:45.960 --> 2:19:49.000]  and other areas of the world are following suit like australia
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:52.760]  so pray for these folks big time this is a very serious situation
[2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:56.280]  and stay tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely bare
[2:19:56.280 --> 2:20:01.560]  amount leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:20:01.560 --> 2:20:15.000]  of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:20.280]  folks you got to understand i have an extremely
[2:20:20.280 --> 2:20:25.960]  highly respectable guest on with me now dr brian artists we have extremely
[2:20:25.960 --> 2:20:29.800]  just highly respected i mean world-renowned people that tune in
[2:20:29.800 --> 2:20:35.960]  every day and so i don't i don't mean to demean
[2:20:35.960 --> 2:20:42.120]  this broadcast i really don't i mean we we have a high level of respect here
[2:20:42.120 --> 2:20:46.520]  and with all the guests and everything and the crew so this is not an attempt
[2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:50.440]  to demean things here but i mean i i'm serious man like
[2:20:50.440 --> 2:20:54.760]  this is like an alien takeover i just don't know how else to make sense of
[2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:57.880]  this how can they we have all the science
[2:20:57.880 --> 2:21:01.400]  i mean it's undeniable how can they push for this vaccine
[2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:04.840]  that is more deadly than the virus it's not an argument that's that's the data
[2:21:04.840 --> 2:21:07.480]  that's the science i mean what is going on here
[2:21:07.480 --> 2:21:10.920]  well like again so i'm not trying to demean the audience i'm not trying to
[2:21:10.920 --> 2:21:13.800]  demean the trans transmissions here i'm not trying to demean everything that
[2:21:13.800 --> 2:21:17.720]  info wars has done over the years i don't talk about aliens i don't talk
[2:21:17.720 --> 2:21:20.440]  about paranormal that's not that's not our thing here
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:24.040]  i'm just at a loss at this point this is so ridiculous
[2:21:24.040 --> 2:21:28.920]  this is so overwhelming i mean you watch alien movies all day long in our
[2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:32.360]  our world now is like more insane and unbelievable than it
[2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:36.120]  so i'm not here to talk about paranormal or alien invasion i'm just
[2:21:36.120 --> 2:21:42.680]  saying this this is alien this is anti-human this is not natural
[2:21:42.680 --> 2:21:46.360]  something else is going on here folks and it just doesn't make sense
[2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:50.440]  so i i don't get it you don't get it i mean are these humans that just want us
[2:21:50.440 --> 2:21:53.080]  all dead are these are these humans that just hate life
[2:21:53.080 --> 2:21:55.800]  and hate humanity are they really just full blown
[2:21:55.800 --> 2:21:59.080]  eugenicists do they do they really believe that population control is the
[2:21:59.080 --> 2:22:02.280]  answer so they're just lying to you about everything and until we're all
[2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:05.160]  dead so again this is i'm not trying to demean
[2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:08.280]  anything that we've created here or the great guest i'm just
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:11.320]  i'm just overwhelmed by it all but let's get back into
[2:22:11.320 --> 2:22:15.880]  the grand jury that you brought up dr artist and the significance of this
[2:22:15.880 --> 2:22:19.160]  because look the push back against these deadly vaccines it has to start
[2:22:19.160 --> 2:22:22.200]  somewhere it has to get teeth it needs to get into the courts
[2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:27.640]  and uh this is this is one way to do so that's right so dr raneer fulmick out
[2:22:27.640 --> 2:22:31.080]  of germany's the lead attorney he's put together a group of a thousand
[2:22:31.080 --> 2:22:34.840]  international lawyers ten thousand international scientists medical
[2:22:34.840 --> 2:22:38.200]  professionals and this is his opening arguments for a
[2:22:38.200 --> 2:22:42.120]  five-day grand jury just completed putting together and he's going
[2:22:42.120 --> 2:22:45.000]  after a whole lot of people he brings it to light
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:48.600]  that the individuals like bill gates that you've already mentioned here shown on
[2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:53.160]  the show uh claus schwaub and others devos the the organization
[2:22:53.160 --> 2:22:56.840]  this is his opening statements to the grand jury let me just read this to you
[2:22:56.840 --> 2:22:59.240]  you talk about an alien takeover let me tell you what
[2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:04.120]  dr raneer fulmick's opening statements for day one of his five-day grand jury
[2:23:04.120 --> 2:23:07.560]  ladies and gentlemen this case is about a long planned agenda
[2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:11.240]  of a group of ultra rich and their financial mafia
[2:23:11.240 --> 2:23:16.760]  based in the city of london and on wall street to use a pseudo pandemic as a
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:20.840]  guide behind which while our attention is on the pandemic
[2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:24.120]  they want to complete their decades long efforts
[2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:28.920]  to gain full and complete control over all of us
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:33.560]  when you speak of an alien takeover this is what dr raneer fulmick has laid
[2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:36.840]  out perfectly with experts experts like dr uh
[2:23:36.840 --> 2:23:40.520]  david martin who was able to show this since 2002
[2:23:40.520 --> 2:23:45.160]  our federal government has actually applied for and owns the patents for
[2:23:45.160 --> 2:23:49.160]  every single one of these sars covet two viruses
[2:23:49.160 --> 2:23:53.960]  that they have been creating this entire pandemic as a plan it started out with
[2:23:53.960 --> 2:23:59.240]  the plan the world economic forum their agenda 201 that was days one and two
[2:23:59.240 --> 2:24:02.840]  day three of the grand jury got into medical malpractice
[2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:08.760]  the falsified and fraudulent PCR tests and the scientists and experts behind
[2:24:08.760 --> 2:24:12.920]  this technology that absolutely did testify and showed all the
[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:17.480]  documentation that PCR tests never have been able to identify
[2:24:17.480 --> 2:24:21.400]  isolate or diagnose viral infections of any kind
[2:24:21.400 --> 2:24:24.920]  i was asked on the day three to bring forward
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:28.520]  the beginning of the medical malpractice side of coven
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:31.800]  so what i did was actually go through the
[2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:36.760]  early trials on remdesivir that dr raneer fulmick had already deposed me for
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:40.520]  a year a so ago as he was collecting experts around the world
[2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:44.760]  but anthony fouchie of the nih when he put in this one and only drug to be the
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:47.480]  solution for covet 19 hospitalized americans
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:51.640]  absolutely knew and i showed all the documentations on day three of this
[2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:56.520]  grand jury that anthony fouchie was aware that remdesivir from a trial used
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:25:00.120]  against the ebola virus in africa was proven to be the least safe
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:03.240]  and the most deadly of the four experimental drugs
[2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:07.960]  which was absolutely the opposite of what he professed and put in writing to
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:11.720]  our federal government what he said to every hospital in our nation and every
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:14.520]  doctor it was never proven safe and effective it was the only
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:18.920]  drug proven to kill over 50 of everyone they gave that drug to in africa
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:23.320]  and yes this was another research study and i'm gonna say right now
[2:25:23.320 --> 2:25:28.600]  it was a eugenics experiment to actually mass murder more people in africa
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:31.960]  using four experimental drugs and then he took that drug it was gonna
[2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:35.480]  when he found out it was the most deadly in that trial he then made it the only
[2:25:35.480 --> 2:25:38.760]  drug in america to be used throughout every hospitalized
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:44.120]  patient in icu for the entire year of 2020 and to this day oan i brought this
[2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:47.320]  up in the grand jury and they didn't even know your audience probably doesn't
[2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:50.680]  know unless they watched it i said thank you for having me on as a
[2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:55.080]  expert witness inside of this third day of the grand jury did you know were
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:58.280]  near fulmy that remdesivir not only was known
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:02.280]  before anthony fouchie selected it in 2020 he not only knew it was deadly
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:06.360]  he knew it actually caused in 31 of all people they give that drug to for five
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:09.640]  to ten days he knew it caused acute kidney failure liver failure and heart
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:13.080]  failure that's what they published and knew from their studies
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:16.600]  and then i looked at him i said can you imagine two years later
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:22.760]  we're now into february the actual fda of the united states just authorized
[2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:29.240]  january 21st 2022 that the only authorized drug to be used in all
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:33.480]  newborns and pediatric age patients in america
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:39.720]  in hospitals or outside of hospitals who pcr test positive for coveted
[2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:43.240]  the only drug they're allowed to pump into the veins of these newborns and
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:47.880]  children in america is remdesivir and they were shocked
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:51.560]  they could not believe it when the judge asked me at the end of all of my
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:55.160]  testimony for an hour and a half he goes dr artist
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:26:59.080]  all of the information research and documents you provided
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:03.720]  are you convinced in your opinion and in your expert testimony
[2:27:03.720 --> 2:27:08.120]  is this a outright attempt to cause harm and death of innocent individuals
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:11.080]  around the world these coveted hospital protocols
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:17.720]  and i said your honor this is textbook eugenics and oh and i need to let you
[2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:21.080]  know right now one of the things that's made me even more angry since i
[2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:24.520]  did the grand jury presented all this info i can't believe they're targeting
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:28.680]  children across this entire nation babies with remdesivir
[2:27:28.680 --> 2:27:32.040]  there's no threat to them of dying from coveted why would you ever inject them
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:35.640]  with a drug known to be deadly and toxic to the human body
[2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:39.400]  and we gave all the documentation there but what is really upsetting me now
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:43.560]  when i say this is a eugenics program the cdc the fda and the nyh
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:47.000]  right now are all lying to the american public
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:52.280]  to different races including hispanics non whites which would be blacks african
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:54.520]  americans they are targeting these individuals
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:59.640]  they are actually pro putting propaganda together in medical journal
[2:27:59.640 --> 2:28:04.200]  trying to convince blacks and hispanics in this country
[2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:08.520]  that they are the most likely to end up in hospitals and to die from coveted
[2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:13.080]  that is not true they are also telling you that black males younger than 12
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:17.480]  are the children most likely to develop mis-c which is a
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:22.040]  side effect of the Pfizer shot listed on one of those 30 pages of side effects
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:25.240]  it was also known by the fda before the shots ever came out
[2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:29.480]  multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children multiple organs in the body
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:34.280]  becoming inflamed from the shots that has a complication of death in children
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:37.160]  and by the way because we're about to go to a break here so just just hold that
[2:28:37.160 --> 2:28:39.320]  thought because we got to go to this break by the way folks just so you
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:43.400]  understand uh i doctor artists has actually laid
[2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:47.160]  this out for me two times on the air on the joneshow once when i was
[2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:50.520]  guest hosting and on the war room runs he has all the receipts like he
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:54.120]  literally has all the documents all the data backing up everything that he's
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:56.840]  just told you

[2:31:51.080 --> 2:31:54.600]  get yours today it's ready to ship but i wouldn't wait because prices are about
[2:31:54.600 --> 2:31:58.360]  to go up because inflation is exploded
[2:31:58.360 --> 2:32:01.880]  it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can
[2:32:01.880 --> 2:32:05.800]  decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere
[2:32:05.800 --> 2:32:08.920]  but if you look at all the different studies reports about my nasa and other
[2:32:08.920 --> 2:32:12.200]  governments other agencies they all disagree on what's really
[2:32:12.200 --> 2:32:16.520]  happening with the climate the only constant the only great truth is
[2:32:16.520 --> 2:32:20.840]  change is the only constant so yes climate change
[2:32:20.840 --> 2:32:24.440]  is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the
[2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:27.560]  70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really
[2:32:27.560 --> 2:32:30.920]  happen the way they wanted to okay now it's just climate change
[2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:35.240]  but did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[2:32:35.240 --> 2:32:38.840]  when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy
[2:32:38.840 --> 2:32:43.400]  and bill gates and the UN they have weather control trees from 1979 and
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:47.240]  bill gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time
[2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:51.240]  in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring
[2:32:51.240 --> 2:32:55.000]  different particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man-made
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:57.960]  climate change is real
[2:32:57.960 --> 2:33:07.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:11.160 --> 2:33:14.040]  all right dr brian artist is with us he's about to have to board a plane so
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:17.640]  we've just got a couple more moments with him i want him to finish up on the
[2:33:17.640 --> 2:33:23.320]  grand jury and then uh what's next so what happens next
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:28.680]  dr artist all right so they wrapped up their five-day grand jury and now this
[2:33:28.680 --> 2:33:33.320]  is going to be a model that that every country around the world can use
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:36.440]  now knowing the expert witnesses the documentation to now hold all of these
[2:33:36.440 --> 2:33:39.320]  individuals accountable and we need to do it here also
[2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:42.600]  as a result of the things we've been able to do you've noticed owen and your
[2:33:42.600 --> 2:33:45.720]  audiences have noticed there's about 12 countries in europe in the last three
[2:33:45.720 --> 2:33:49.480]  weeks who have dropped all of their mandates i am signed on a lot of
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:53.640]  lawsuits targeting the uk parliament boris johnson
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:33:56.920]  mhra in the uk i mean there's tons of us out there trying to get
[2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:00.440]  traction to get this done unfortunately america is going to be the last
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:04.360]  to admit that they were wrong that they have actually put in regulations
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:08.040]  lockdowns mandates that were actually criminal we're going to be the last
[2:34:08.040 --> 2:34:10.680]  ones unfortunately i want i need everybody to know that it's not now the
[2:34:10.680 --> 2:34:13.880]  time to be docile we have to continue to
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:17.640]  stand up and say no to the any of these mandates
[2:34:17.640 --> 2:34:20.840]  and then number two i want everybody to know that uh we are going around the
[2:34:20.840 --> 2:34:23.400]  country meeting in state capital buildings we'll be doing it here in

[2:34:56.920 --> 2:35:00.920]  you all right thank you all right there goes dr brian artist
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:05.320]  all right i need to take a deep breath here because
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:09.960]  the engines are revving the heartbeat is up and uh quite frankly i'm just a
[2:35:09.960 --> 2:35:13.800]  little ticked off that there's a group of people that want to kill us all
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:17.560]  yeah
[2:35:18.840 --> 2:35:23.800]  certain ancient instincts
[2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:30.280]  starting to come to the fore
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:34.120]  but i'm just gonna stop right there and you know
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:37.800]  here's what it is now i was having a discussion with a friend of mine last
[2:35:37.800 --> 2:35:42.040]  night about this we're both about the same age
[2:35:42.040 --> 2:35:50.440]  and you know we have just had it so good in this country we don't even realize it
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:53.800]  and for all the things that we have to put up with and the bs and the government
[2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:57.160]  and everything and and yeah there's fair complaints and there's problems i mean
[2:35:57.160 --> 2:36:00.680]  but but we have had it so good in this country
[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:08.600]  that it's it's here's the analogy that that i made last night and i think
[2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:13.960]  makes sense we're like the dodo bird now on this planet
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:17.560]  we have not had a predator that threatens us
[2:36:17.560 --> 2:36:21.800]  and so we're just walking around like the dodo birds thinking nothing can
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:25.560]  touch us nothing can harm us we're the dominant species we're all good
[2:36:25.560 --> 2:36:28.440]  well you know what there's there's something else out there folks there's
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:36.360]  a predator there's a predator and if we don't identify
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:46.760]  and nullify the human predator that we're the prey to or the prey of
[2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:55.160]  it's going to be uh it's it's going to not be a good future for humanity
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:36:58.280]  and i and i just pray we can have a victory here and we can get humanity
[2:36:58.280 --> 2:37:03.080]  back on the right track but we we cannot turn into the dodo bird
[2:37:03.080 --> 2:37:06.920]  thinking that there are no predators against humanity out there folks they
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:10.280]  are everywhere whether you think it's like an alien
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:14.120]  invasion or a demonic possession or these are just humans that just
[2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:18.440]  want you dead for whatever reason it's on
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:25.000]  right now and it's funny because
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:28.680]  the whole reason we sparked this conversation is
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:32.360]  there were a couple of young punks running around the gym last night just
[2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:36.680]  just acting like absolute jackasses and we were just
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:40.280]  looking at each other like what is wrong with the youth like what what
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:45.720]  what is going on these how can people behave like this
[2:37:45.720 --> 2:37:48.760]  and it just led to the conversation it's like you know
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:55.240]  people just have no idea how good they got it they really have no idea
[2:37:55.240 --> 2:37:59.800]  and i was listening to uh it's like a pro men's health
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:04.360]  podcast the other day and the host was saying how
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:08.760]  we're probably at a point in time maybe never before seen
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:14.600]  in in maybe even human history and you can boil it down to america or maybe
[2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:18.920]  say worldwide but i mean what percentage of men
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:23.720]  what percentage of males right now
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:28.520]  are so ill prepared for this world and what comes next
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:31.800]  let's say for war what what percentage of males
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:35.480]  tomorrow if they had to defend their lives or their family or their house
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:39.640]  what percentage of males would be mentally and physically
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:43.480]  prepared to defend themselves defend their country defend their planet defend
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:50.280]  their family defend their home or go to war what percentage of males
[2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:55.080]  it's pretty bad and it's all by design
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:59.640]  so that a predator can come in and pray on us
[2:38:59.640 --> 2:39:04.360]  and suck our life force and conquer us
[2:39:04.360 --> 2:39:09.640]  and make us slaves in a new world system so whether you think it's humans
[2:39:09.640 --> 2:39:12.920]  doing this consciously for whatever reason or aliens or demonic possession
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:19.640]  folks it is on right now
[2:39:20.760 --> 2:39:24.360]  and that's what i'm saying is like
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:27.800]  it's like these couple these these like punk high schoolers are running around
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:33.640]  like trying to start crap at a gym and i mean i don't even bother but it's
[2:39:33.640 --> 2:39:38.120]  like listen dude you don't even know the planet you live on
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:40.360]  and
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:45.080]  you know like i'm dealing with a worldwide
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:49.080]  corporate mafia that's coming after me and my family
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:56.120]  so why don't you just grow up it's like this never know they'll never get it
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:40:00.840]  they've had such a life of leisure and laziness
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:05.800]  and lethargy and and and just being spoiled and everything and they just
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:10.280]  they just have no idea what life is really like on this planet
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:17.160]  but that's just a microcosm of really what the elite like Nancy Pelosi are like
[2:40:17.160 --> 2:40:20.600]  i mean you could say Nancy Pelosi is a blood-sucking demon
[2:40:20.600 --> 2:40:24.280]  you know but i mean she is so detached from reality
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:28.520]  she sits up there and rubs her hands together when the president is talking
[2:40:28.520 --> 2:40:33.960]  about smoke pits burning american soldiers to death
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:37.400]  and she's like up there grinning and rubbing her fists together like that's
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:40.840]  a good thing that makes her happy that gets her off
[2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:45.320]  she's gone folks Nancy Pelosi is gone she's not on this planet
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:49.560]  she's not on this plane of existence so again call it demonic possession call it
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:53.080]  alien call it whatever you want that's what
[2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:57.400]  we're dealing with and so they think oh we know we're all the rich
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:01.320]  we know we're all the rich corrupted russian oligarchs keep their money and
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:05.080]  keep their boats so we're gonna go steal it
[2:41:05.080 --> 2:41:08.600]  so so now what we're gonna have some we're gonna have some petty
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:13.000]  petty war of the world's elites with with with the poor people on this
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:18.120]  planet's blood drenching the dirt so that they can have control over this
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:22.120]  planet with the resources and the land
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:27.640]  and it's it's totally detached from reality demons like Nancy Pelosi and
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:33.240]  Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton running the whole show
[2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:40.440]  all right when we come back i'm gonna get more into the situation in

[2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:14.680]  global private corporations has put in place it is the symbol of the
[2:44:14.680 --> 2:44:18.360]  permanent emergency from which we will never emerge
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:21.320]  it is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad
[2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:25.320]  and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:31.000]  of the sun it is the symbol of our complete and total

[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:43.640]  upon us claus schwaub and the eunit admit they're
[2:44:43.640 --> 2:44:47.080]  coming out with implantable microchips as part of the world id and carbon
[2:44:47.080 --> 2:44:50.040]  taxes things only get worse from here if we
[2:44:50.040 --> 2:44:54.040]  submit they only get better if we resist and say no

[2:44:58.440 --> 2:45:02.520]  anything of lasting durability anything that's really satisfying and
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:07.080]  empowering and fulfilling it's going to be hard to attain
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:11.480]  and when it comes to information boy is that true today we see
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:15.400]  the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:19.560]  great recent combine trying to collapse our society to build on
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:23.480]  its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision
[2:45:23.480 --> 2:45:27.400]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:31.800]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing

[2:45:46.440 --> 2:45:50.520]  that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[2:45:50.520 --> 2:45:54.440]  and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up with the elix
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:58.040]  that's why we've got to share them now more than ever

[2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:38.440]  out of joy bayhar falling over face planting
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:46.840]  on the view today i don't celebrate that but you know what
[2:48:46.840 --> 2:48:52.200]  it is it is a metaphor
[2:48:52.200 --> 2:48:55.720]  the crew is not jumping up and down right now behind the glass i promise
[2:48:55.720 --> 2:49:00.680]  it's not happening um but you know what it is
[2:49:00.680 --> 2:49:04.680]  it's it's it's sad folks i don't take pleasure out of this it's sad but it's
[2:49:04.680 --> 2:49:09.160]  a it's a manifestation
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:13.240]  because this is god's creation that's the thing he he's in charge here
[2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:21.160]  not not joy bayhar not not joe biden not bill gates not claus schwa they wish
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:25.320]  they wish they had the power of god
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:30.280]  no this is this is god giving them a final warning and striking them down in a
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:35.400]  very passive subtle way like with all the people
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:38.360]  that take the vaccine and then go on television promoting it and then they
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:41.800]  fall over that's that's god just passively
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:49.240]  saying you're going to fall you're going to fail you're going down
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:54.280]  so i don't take pleasure out of that because i'm i'm stuck on this
[2:49:54.280 --> 2:49:59.160]  spaceship planet we call earth with them and and and that's going to blow back
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:01.560]  on me
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:06.120]  but when when you see joy bayhar face planting falling over
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:10.360]  walking on the set of the view today i'm sorry folks but that's just a sign from
[2:50:10.360 --> 2:50:13.400]  god you are falling you're done
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:19.320]  you will fail you will fall you will be struck down
[2:50:20.680 --> 2:50:25.240]  because god made this planet for us
[2:50:25.240 --> 2:50:29.240]  god made this experience this consciousness for us
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:36.440]  not for you not for you bloodsucking vampiric demonic
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:43.240]  genocidal eugenicists you demons
[2:50:43.240 --> 2:50:48.840]  but this isn't hey you know what i'm not i'm not the one in charge here
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:52.280]  i'm not the one that's going to be judging you i'm not the one
[2:50:52.280 --> 2:50:56.680]  that you're going to have to deal with i'm just i'm just praying to god i'm
[2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:02.280]  just i'm just looking for for god's wisdom and guidance
[2:51:02.280 --> 2:51:08.200]  humbling myself you are the fools
[2:51:08.200 --> 2:51:11.640]  you are the fools that thought you could control the fate of this planet
[2:51:11.640 --> 2:51:15.880]  you are the fools that rebuked the creator god
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:21.400]  and he's warning you he's warning you
[2:51:21.400 --> 2:51:27.880]  and quite frankly it folks look it's just going to be bad man
[2:51:27.880 --> 2:51:32.840]  we're going to go under judgment and whatever god is going to do to these
[2:51:32.840 --> 2:51:37.000]  damn demons we're going to have to deal with
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:40.120]  we're going to have to experience
[2:51:40.440 --> 2:51:44.840]  and i just hope we make it on the other side to
[2:51:45.800 --> 2:51:49.400]  at least get back to living on this planet and being humans
[2:51:49.400 --> 2:51:53.080]  in some way shape or form that we're meant to be because this is not it
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:56.760]  i mean folks i've got footage coming up we've got guests coming up later
[2:51:56.760 --> 2:51:59.560]  i've got footage coming up and they're coming through texas
[2:51:59.560 --> 2:52:04.360]  there's this group coming through texas they go have pro trans kid
[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:09.400]  human rights rallies and they walk out these five six seven year olds put them
[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:12.200]  in drag put them in makeup have them doing strip
[2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:17.960]  lap dances you don't think you're going to hell
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:20.840]  you don't think the creator of this universe
[2:52:20.840 --> 2:52:24.840]  is going to strike you down you don't think you're going to be
[2:52:24.840 --> 2:52:29.800]  banned from this existence ever again you think you're ever going to get access
[2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:33.400]  to all of this beauty and all of this potential
[2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:36.680]  you think you're going to ever get access to this again let alone at the
[2:52:36.680 --> 2:52:40.840]  next level no you're going to hell but see
[2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:44.760]  you're trying to create hell on this planet first so that we have to get
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:49.080]  tortured with you not going to happen
[2:52:49.080 --> 2:52:52.680]  so again i don't take pleasure out all these nurses and all these doctors that
[2:52:52.680 --> 2:52:57.080]  promote the vaccine and then fall over dead right there on tv
[2:52:57.080 --> 2:53:01.480]  i don't take pleasure enjoy bayhar not even be able to walk on the set she
[2:53:01.480 --> 2:53:04.680]  falls over and smashes her face into the ground
[2:53:04.680 --> 2:53:07.880]  that doesn't make me feel good because i know that's god
[2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:14.360]  warning you what's going to happen to you if you keep doing this
[2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:17.880]  and see that's the thing is like oh
[2:53:17.880 --> 2:53:23.320]  Putin Putin Putin Russia Russia Russia oh god really is Vladimir Putin trying to
[2:53:23.320 --> 2:53:28.280]  chop the genitals off of children no
[2:53:28.280 --> 2:53:32.680]  is Vladimir Putin promoting sexual perversion
[2:53:32.680 --> 2:53:36.840]  no is Vladimir Putin censoring my free speech
[2:53:36.840 --> 2:53:40.360]  no is Vladimir Putin making me suffocate under a face mask
[2:53:40.360 --> 2:53:43.240]  no is Vladimir Putin making me take a deadly
[2:53:43.240 --> 2:53:48.280]  vaccine that's got a a bigger fatality rate than the virus itself
[2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:52.680]  no is Vladimir Putin opening up my southern border for an invasion
[2:53:52.680 --> 2:53:56.840]  no is Vladimir Putin putting Americans
[2:53:56.840 --> 2:54:00.680]  that are political dissonance behind bars no
[2:54:00.680 --> 2:54:04.440]  so i'm sick and damn tired about hearing about how evil Putin is
[2:54:04.440 --> 2:54:10.680]  when i got just as bad leaders here that are actually probably 10 times worse
[2:54:10.680 --> 2:54:17.640]  how's that for a rant but i mean seriously you look at these
[2:54:17.640 --> 2:54:20.840]  occupiers of our government specifically in the democrat party
[2:54:20.840 --> 2:54:24.120]  i mean they just look like freaking aliens man
[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:29.560]  they look and act and talk like freaking demons
[2:54:29.560 --> 2:54:35.560]  oh i just thank god i'm not part of them oh my god oh please forgive us
[2:54:35.560 --> 2:54:42.680]  all right i ended up going on a rant here
[2:54:42.680 --> 2:54:48.920]  unintentionally paul joseph watson is going to be hosting the
[2:54:48.920 --> 2:54:55.000]  fourth hour today but i've got big guests coming up on the
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:59.160]  war room and i've still got all this news in front of me
[2:55:01.640 --> 2:55:04.440]  and it's like i said yesterday if you were tuned in the war room i'm not trying
[2:55:04.440 --> 2:55:08.040]  to be pessimistic here i'm not trying to put you in a bad mood
[2:55:08.040 --> 2:55:12.760]  we're going to win god is going to win freedom is going to win
[2:55:12.760 --> 2:55:16.600]  humanity is going to win 100 percent absolutely guaranteed
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:19.080]  it's just a matter of what we're going to have to go through to get to that point
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:24.840]  how bad it's going to be and that's why we're here on air
[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:30.280]  peacefully and politically trying to awaken hearts and minds
[2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:37.400]  as a buffer so that whenever whatever god's vengeance will be on these damn
[2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:41.160]  demons it's like at least a buffer where a lot of
[2:55:41.160 --> 2:55:43.960]  us are going to know what's going on and say okay we know what's going on let's
[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:47.160]  kind of we'll back off we know it's going to be tough we know it's going to be
[2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:50.840]  rough and tumble but this is this is god's will this is god reclaiming the
[2:55:50.840 --> 2:55:55.560]  planet from satan
[2:55:55.560 --> 2:56:03.320]  so uh that's what's going on here
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:06.520]  but uh i mean folks they just they just busted
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:10.600]  a massive child sex trafficking network
[2:56:10.600 --> 2:56:15.880]  in new zealand hundreds held after new zealand led investigation into images
[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:19.400]  of child abuse it's it's child rape it's child porn it's it's it's child
[2:56:19.400 --> 2:56:22.280]  kidnapping and they just caught hundreds of them
[2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:25.880]  and by the way just not getting seen anywhere
[2:56:25.880 --> 2:56:31.960]  that damn demon ardent in new zealand is still enforcing all the coveted stuff
[2:56:31.960 --> 2:56:37.480]  and forcing the vaccines there is huge protests going on in new zealand that
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:41.560]  are actually getting really violent where protesters are like lining up their
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:45.160]  cars to ram through police lines i mean it's getting
[2:56:45.160 --> 2:56:48.840]  serious and nobody's playing it anywhere and i understand why we were
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:53.000]  distracted by ukraine and we got our own problems to deal with
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:56.520]  i mean that's going on folks
[2:56:57.640 --> 2:57:03.880]  and there's a at least 70 mile convoy now it might be closer to 100 we don't
[2:57:03.880 --> 2:57:08.520]  have the latest numbers and um in fact am i guys do i have
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:13.480]  my guest on today who's who's who's joining us covering the uh

[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.400]  going on

[3:01:13.640 --> 3:01:17.400]  show up and and promote genital
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:21.320]  mutilization of children
[3:01:22.840 --> 3:01:28.600]  this is unseen uh this is unseen unheard of crap man
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:32.680]  i mean you you can talk about the fall of rome and and and you can talk about
[3:01:32.680 --> 3:01:35.720]  other
[3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:39.640]  civilizations throughout time in societies and they got decadent and they
[3:01:39.640 --> 3:01:44.360]  got perverted and they did all i mean but promoting
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:48.440]  promoting pedophilia and genital mutilization of children
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:52.440]  that's that's a new low for energy and who is it it's the left
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:55.880]  it's the liberals it's the democrats they want to chop your
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:02:02.760]  kids balls off you freaks but they just proudly do it and they go
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:07.400]  have these big events and so we've got really disturbing footage from that
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:10.600]  but uh we'll be airing all of that that's all gonna be coming up it's just
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:13.240]  folks it's unbelievable and by the way did you know in new york city
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:19.480]  yesterday they had a pro mask rally a pro mask rally
[3:02:19.480 --> 3:02:24.040]  these libs are never going to take their mask off it is the mark of the demon
[3:02:24.040 --> 3:02:28.200]  it is the mark that they have been conquered
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:35.880]  it is the mark of total submission it is the mark of total brainwashing
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:42.600]  and and really it breaks my heart
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:48.840]  because this was never supposed to be their destiny
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:52.360]  this was never supposed to be where they ended up
[3:02:52.360 --> 3:02:56.360]  but here they are
[3:02:56.840 --> 3:03:02.680]  see i have to i have to understand that maybe it's a benefit of the doubt type
[3:03:02.680 --> 3:03:07.240]  thing but you know if uh if a soldier goes to war
[3:03:07.240 --> 3:03:12.920]  and he gets his legs blown off by a grenade
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:16.840]  and he he comes home in a wheelchair he's got prosthetic legs or whatever
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:21.080]  you don't make fun of the soldier and say oh ha ha you can't walk you can't run
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:25.240]  look at you you're so weak no you understand that oh that guy
[3:03:25.240 --> 3:03:28.920]  fought in a war he got his legs blown off
[3:03:28.920 --> 3:03:33.720]  so it's kind of the same thing with these brainwashed
[3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:41.240]  zombified leftists it's like you you've been hit with a psychological weapon
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:44.920]  you've been hit with brainwashing propaganda and so
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:49.640]  it's like i wouldn't make fun of a guy who got his legs blown off in war
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:53.720]  do you make fun of these individuals who have had their minds blown apart
[3:03:53.720 --> 3:03:59.080]  blown to bits by the propaganda media
[3:03:59.560 --> 3:04:04.440]  because that's what it is i mean they've had their minds i mean they've had
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:08.200]  essentially a psychological lobotomy they've they've had a
[3:04:08.200 --> 3:04:12.760]  a brainwashing bomb put into their head and their brain has been blown
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:17.640]  to bits their their brain doesn't work they're gone
[3:04:17.640 --> 3:04:21.960]  promoting transects for kids i mean folks that's pedophilia
[3:04:21.960 --> 3:04:27.160]  stop stop pretending it's not promoting wearing a mask all day
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:30.120]  are you kidding me you don't even want to breathe air
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:34.840]  you don't even want to breathe air by the way joe biden told a massive
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:40.840]  whopper of a lie today giving a speech he said that five police officers died
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:45.240]  on january 6th not a single police officer died on january 6th
[3:04:45.240 --> 3:04:49.320]  but he's out there promoting the big lie because that's all these damn demons do
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:57.160]  pull joseph watson takes over i'll be back in an hour
[3:04:58.280 --> 3:05:01.960]  sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything
[3:05:01.960 --> 3:05:05.880]  that's going on both at home and the world at large
[3:05:05.880 --> 3:05:09.960]  if you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of

[3:05:33.480 --> 3:05:36.680]  dissolved into the formula before you even take it
[3:05:36.680 --> 3:05:40.680]  one of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower
[3:05:40.680 --> 3:05:44.760]  which was traditionally used by native americans like the cherries

[3:06:27.880 --> 3:06:34.200]  you are listening to paul joseph watson
[3:06:34.360 --> 3:06:37.960]  we're live on this thursday third of march edition
[3:06:37.960 --> 3:06:43.080]  of the summit news hour one week since the war in ukraine started
[3:06:43.080 --> 3:06:47.640]  but have you heard the news have you heard the rumors apparently sergi labrov the
[3:06:47.640 --> 3:06:53.080]  russian foreign minister is right now organizing agreeing to a ceasefire
[3:06:53.080 --> 3:06:59.240]  vladimir putin himself is about to sign the terms of the kremlin's surrender
[3:06:59.240 --> 3:07:03.080]  the tanks are turning back to moscow and kiev
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:10.040]  may just be saved why because Siberian cats have been banned from competing
[3:07:10.040 --> 3:07:14.440]  in international cat competitions
[3:07:14.440 --> 3:07:18.360]  oh my god i didn't think it could get any worse
[3:07:18.360 --> 3:07:24.280]  it always gets worse doesn't it headline international cat federation
[3:07:24.280 --> 3:07:28.840]  bans russian cats from all competitions
[3:07:28.840 --> 3:07:32.760]  yes the russian blue the peter ball the Siberian cat
[3:07:32.760 --> 3:07:39.320]  have all been righteously rightfully punished for being born in
[3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:46.120]  russia the pussy cats have faced punitive damages and rightly so i mean if
[3:07:46.120 --> 3:07:50.200]  they're not speaking out against putin then they're basically with putin right
[3:07:50.200 --> 3:07:54.920]  putler hitler putin putin bad russian cats bad
[3:07:54.920 --> 3:08:01.480]  the platform russian cats cancel Siberian cats it's been done
[3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:05.800]  all those uh ukrainian flags in your twitter bios have worked
[3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:11.560]  the cats have been cancelled this is not the bevel on b by the way this is a
[3:08:11.560 --> 3:08:15.880]  real story an international cat federation has banned
[3:08:15.880 --> 3:08:21.080]  all russian owned and bred cats from competing in international competitions
[3:08:21.080 --> 3:08:24.680]  in a move that's sure to stop putin's war machine
[3:08:24.680 --> 3:08:32.120]  the federation international feline vif issued a statement
[3:08:32.120 --> 3:08:36.360]  saying it quote cannot just witness these atrocities and do nothing the cats
[3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:38.840]  are gone
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:44.440]  the war crimes apparently being carried out against ukrainians
[3:08:44.440 --> 3:08:48.760]  that they finally got justice for that the cats are cancelled
[3:08:48.760 --> 3:08:54.680]  the federation has decided that quote no cat bred in russia may be imported and
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:58.840]  registered in any five pedigree book outside of russia
[3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:02.920]  no cat belonging to exhibitors living in russia may be entered at any five show
[3:09:02.920 --> 3:09:08.840]  outside russia the cats have been de-platformed and rightly so
[3:09:08.840 --> 3:09:15.480]  maybe putin's dogs are next this is not i remember stories i remember
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:20.920]  reading stories last week about i think it was dash on dogs in the united
[3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:24.120]  kingdom being kicked in the street during world war two
[3:09:24.120 --> 3:09:29.880]  that's where we're heading the ban will apply until at least the end of may
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:33.400]  and will punish popular breeds such as the russian blue peter bald and the
[3:09:33.400 --> 3:09:36.200]  Siberian cat which can cost up to four thousand dollars
[3:09:36.200 --> 3:09:39.800]  again if you own the same dogs that vladimir putin owns
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:43.800]  maybe your business deserves to be shut down as well
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:47.480]  the story attracts a condemnation from chinese users of weibo
[3:09:47.480 --> 3:09:51.720]  with one asserting animals should not have nationalities
[3:09:51.720 --> 3:09:54.840]  as any rational person will surely understand this is virtually guaranteed
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:09:59.000]  to send battle tanks scurrying back to Moscow
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:04.280]  and again this is the humorous end of the hysteria
[3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:07.880]  there's actually a lot more serious end to the point where
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:12.200]  we have congressman eric swalwell in america calling to expel all russian
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:16.360]  students from university but here in the uk we have a
[3:10:16.360 --> 3:10:22.360]  uk conservative mp tom tuggan hat calling for all russian
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:25.480]  citizens to be booted out of the uk
[3:10:25.480 --> 3:10:30.280]  deported all of them now when 15 out of 19
[3:10:30.280 --> 3:10:35.080]  Saudi arabian hijackers fly planes into the pentagon and the world trade center
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:39.560]  what happens to ordinary Saudi citizens nothing whatsoever as it shouldn't
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:43.240]  what happens when the government the military of Saudi Arabia
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:47.160]  indiscriminately bombs Yemen and kills hundreds of thousands of
[3:10:47.160 --> 3:10:51.800]  civilians with weapons provided to them by the united kingdom
[3:10:51.800 --> 3:10:56.200]  by the usa by nato powers what sanctions do ordinary
[3:10:56.200 --> 3:11:02.600]  Saudi citizens face none whatsoever and we don't even friggin talk about it
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:07.160]  yet what are they doing to russians this is a headline out of wanted in
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:11.000]  milan dot com italian university backtracks
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:16.120]  after canceling dos doyevsky course
[3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:20.280]  fedor dos doyevsky has become the unlikely source of a controversy at
[3:11:20.280 --> 3:11:23.160]  milan university over its decision to drop a
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:27.240]  course on the 19th century russian novelist yes
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:30.840]  some russian dude who wrote books 200 years ago

[3:11:48.680 --> 3:11:54.920]  punishment had been cancelled to avoid any controversy in a moment
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:11:58.040]  of high tension well now you've got controversy haven't you
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:02.760]  because you're acting like utter idiotic prats
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:06.920]  canceling a 200 year old russian novelist because
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:11.480]  radimir putin bad this is the level of the utter hysteria
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:15.080]  that we've devolved to in the space of one single
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:18.840]  week they're trying to cancel 200 300 year old
[3:12:18.840 --> 3:12:21.880]  russian authors
[3:12:22.760 --> 3:12:26.040]  russian conductor of the unic philharmonic orchestra
[3:12:26.040 --> 3:12:30.360]  fired after failing to submit to mayor's demand he denounced putin
[3:12:30.360 --> 3:12:35.000]  again he engaged in wrongthink by just not responding to this
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:39.880]  demand by the mayor of munich dita reeter
[3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:43.800]  who previously by the way demanded that the alliance arena in munich be lit up
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:48.120]  with lgbt rainbow colors during euro 2000
[3:12:48.120 --> 3:12:52.760]  because hungary dared to pass a law that protected children from
[3:12:52.760 --> 3:12:56.680]  transgender propaganda oh my god how dare they
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:13:00.680]  that failed this didn't he literally said to this
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:05.240]  music maestro this world famous russian born conductor
[3:13:05.240 --> 3:13:09.000]  of the munich philharmonic orchestra you must
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:13.880]  get out genuflect display total ideological subservience

[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:35.800]  and career has been canceled because he refused to bow
[3:13:35.800 --> 3:13:41.320]  to the ideological conformity cult doesn't even matter what you think about
[3:13:41.320 --> 3:13:45.240]  the invasion of ukraine what you think about vladimir putin
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:49.560]  political authorities in supposedly free western countries
[3:13:49.560 --> 3:13:53.800]  shouldn't have the power to demand ideological conformity
[3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:59.080]  from public figures before allowing them to keep their jobs
[3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:03.560]  that's tyranny something similar happened i remember in germany in the 1930s
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:07.480]  where a certain minority of people were told to conform were told to obey and
[3:14:07.480 --> 3:14:12.120]  weren't treated very well for not fitting in let's just put it that way
[3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:18.600]  music maestro valery gergiev was sacked fired three years before his contract
[3:14:18.600 --> 3:14:21.720]  was due to end because he refused to submit to dita's call for him to
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:26.520]  denounce putin's putlers brutal war of aggression
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:31.240]  they also canceled anna and netra beko a russian diva who is one of the opera's
[3:14:31.240 --> 3:14:34.760]  biggest international stars she's russian garen the bin
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:38.760]  because where the where where the where the group of caring and kindness and
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:42.440]  where against xenophobia and fascism but if you're russian
[3:14:42.440 --> 3:14:47.640]  get out writer had given gergiev until monday to respond to a
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:50.520]  demand that he expresses ideological conformity but it wasn't
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:53.880]  forthcoming so he didn't even come out and say
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:59.160]  no putin has reasons for invading ukraine or there's a different side to the
[3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:02.200]  story he didn't even come out and say that he didn't say
[3:15:02.200 --> 3:15:08.040]  anything he was given a deadline by this far leftist mayor
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:12.680]  to proffer himself to display his ideological subservience
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:16.280]  and he didn't and this is what the mayor said quote
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:19.640]  i would have expected him to reconsider and revise his very positive
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:24.200]  assessment of russia's leader he didn't so now not only is he lost his job with
[3:15:24.200 --> 3:15:28.200]  the munich philharmonica orchestra he's lost numerous other
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:33.160]  positions and basically his life has been ruined but there's backlash over
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:36.920]  munich orchestra conductor being fired for failure to denounce putin
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:41.400]  where thankfully some prominent people in german politics and german society
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:46.520]  are coming out and saying that this uh attitude test is completely arbitrary
[3:15:46.520 --> 3:15:50.600]  completely stupid and it's going to lead to more and more censorship and
[3:15:50.600 --> 3:15:54.680]  tyranny summit.news we'll be back down the way
[3:15:56.200 --> 3:15:59.480]  a riotous mob whether they were present that day
[3:15:59.480 --> 3:16:02.760]  or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our
[3:16:02.760 --> 3:16:06.520]  democracy insurrection we will follow the facts
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:12.760]  wherever they lead domestic terrorists the days of independent media are
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:16.520]  numbered the government has made it illegal to oppose them

[3:20:16.040 --> 3:20:23.400]  in the united kingdom it's paul joseph watson
[3:20:23.400 --> 3:20:29.480]  so russian cats have been cancelled just like a disabled russian athletes banned
[3:20:29.480 --> 3:20:33.080]  from the paralympics. Siberian cats have been banned from
[3:20:33.080 --> 3:20:39.480]  competing in international competitions because Putin bad 300 200 year old
[3:20:39.480 --> 3:20:44.600]  russian authors like Dostoevsky have been banned in terms of a
[3:20:44.600 --> 3:20:48.360]  university in milan banning a course on Dostoevsky
[3:20:48.360 --> 3:20:53.480]  they later had to reverse it but again it illustrates the utter hysteria
[3:20:53.480 --> 3:20:58.440]  but then the star conductor of the munich orchestra
[3:20:58.440 --> 3:21:03.640]  a guy called Valerie Gurgiev he has actually been cancelled this isn't a
[3:21:03.640 --> 3:21:06.440]  joke his life is basically over in Germany
[3:21:06.440 --> 3:21:10.840]  his career's finished because he's russian and he refuses to denounce
[3:21:10.840 --> 3:21:15.880]  Vladimir Putin after a demand a public demand
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:19.800]  by the mayor of munich that he come out and publicly
[3:21:19.800 --> 3:21:24.280]  denounce Putin again an ideological purity test
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:29.400]  to display his moral exhibitionism what was he gonna have what's gonna happen
[3:21:29.400 --> 3:21:32.840]  next is he gonna have people gonna have to come out and say that
[3:21:32.840 --> 3:21:37.560]  you know trans children should be encouraged that the age of consent should
[3:21:37.560 --> 3:21:40.120]  be lowered in Germany and things like that they have to
[3:21:40.120 --> 3:21:42.680]  gonna come out and proffer their complete
[3:21:42.680 --> 3:21:47.320]  genuflection and subservience to the lgbt movement
[3:21:47.320 --> 3:21:52.840]  what is next thankfully there's a slight backlash to this
[3:21:52.840 --> 3:21:56.120]  headline backlash over munich orchestra conductor being fired for failure to
[3:21:56.120 --> 3:21:59.560]  denounce Putin the former federal minister for family
[3:21:59.560 --> 3:22:03.080]  affairs Christina Schroeder tweeted that she thought quote such attitude
[3:22:03.080 --> 3:22:07.960]  tests were silly and counterproductive numerous people also pointed out that
[3:22:07.960 --> 3:22:12.280]  former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had close ties to Russia
[3:22:12.280 --> 3:22:16.200]  with screenwriter Thomas Hugell asking quote is it known whether Munich mayor
[3:22:16.200 --> 3:22:20.120]  writer has already initiated expulsion proceedings against his
[3:22:20.120 --> 3:22:25.960]  fellow party member Gerhard Schroeder and an AFD member of parliament Stephen
[3:22:25.960 --> 3:22:30.360]  Brander also asked a similar question by the way this
[3:22:30.360 --> 3:22:33.720]  russian conductor has also been banned from the vienna
[3:22:33.720 --> 3:22:38.680]  and Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra so his career is basically done
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:42.920]  simply because he's russian many more examples of that which i'm going to get
[3:22:42.920 --> 3:22:45.880]  to but we're going to go to this video first which i put out
[3:22:45.880 --> 3:22:50.920]  just a few hours ago about more examples of this utter hysteria
[3:22:50.920 --> 3:22:56.040]  that is seeing russians being cancelled and de-platformed ordinary russians
[3:22:56.040 --> 3:22:59.480]  not just the oligarchs not just the Putin sympathizers
[3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:03.400]  from all levels of society this is called russophobia
[3:23:03.400 --> 3:23:07.800]  here's the video rumors are swirling that russian troops are surrendering on
[3:23:07.800 --> 3:23:11.800]  mass the tanks are turning round as Putin's war machine is vanquished
[3:23:11.800 --> 3:23:15.480]  why because Milan University cancelled a course on Dostoyevsky
[3:23:15.480 --> 3:23:19.480]  they said they did it to quote avoid controversy utter
[3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:22.920]  mindless stupidity we all know that the real way to stop
[3:23:22.920 --> 3:23:26.520]  Putin's war machine is to prevent russian kids from playing FIFA
[3:23:26.520 --> 3:23:30.680]  or at least to digitally remove NPC computer code from EA sports games
[3:23:30.680 --> 3:23:35.640]  or to rename the Moscow Mule or to ban russian vodka entirely
[3:23:35.640 --> 3:23:38.760]  despite the fact that virtually all of it is made in western europe way
[3:23:38.760 --> 3:23:43.080]  just hearing that Lavrov has declared a ceasefire because some trendy hipster bar
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:46.280]  in east london started calling it a Kiev donkey
[3:23:46.280 --> 3:23:50.680]  now i've got it let's stop russians from being able to buy cheap itchy shy
[3:23:50.680 --> 3:23:54.040]  h&m clothes made by wage slaves in the far east
[3:23:54.040 --> 3:23:58.440]  that'll definitely halt the assault on Odessa but not as swiftly as demoralizing
[3:23:58.440 --> 3:24:01.880]  russian soldiers by informing them that this divvy middle-class
[3:24:01.880 --> 3:24:05.480]  couple in Cambridge painted their house blue and yellow no no no
[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:09.480]  the actual way to stop Putin is to fire the chief conductor of the Munich
[3:24:09.480 --> 3:24:13.160]  philharmonic orchestra because he engaged in wrong thing
[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:17.000]  because valery gergiev didn't respond to the mayor's demand that he kiss
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:20.200]  the ring of ideological conformity in time
[3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:25.400]  he was summarily cancelled and now our repugnantly idiotic culture secretary
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:29.160]  nadine doris the same woman who wants decried cancel
[3:24:29.160 --> 3:24:34.520]  culture is celebrating the removal of a cultural exhibit about the trans-cyberian
[3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:38.920]  railway by a british museum a secretary of culture who is helping to
[3:24:38.920 --> 3:24:43.000]  destroy culture fantastic f***ing bravo because
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:46.440]  preventing people from learning about the construction of a railway that was
[3:24:46.440 --> 3:24:50.600]  built over a hundred years ago is definitely going to stop this war
[3:24:50.600 --> 3:24:54.440]  morons what's next Tolstoy check off pushkin
[3:24:54.440 --> 3:24:58.200]  they're all russians why not burn the books all the books
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:01.800]  domain service namecheap banning russians from using their service and
[3:25:01.800 --> 3:25:05.080]  then bragging about it hillary clinton calling for all russians to
[3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:07.640]  have their cryptocurrency seized remember when
[3:25:07.640 --> 3:25:12.040]  Saudi hijackers carried out 9 11 and then how we imposed crippling economic
[3:25:12.040 --> 3:25:16.440]  constraints on ordinary Saudi citizens no mean either remember when
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:19.640]  Saudis were cut off from using apple pay and google pay
[3:25:19.640 --> 3:25:23.640]  after their country killed hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yemen
[3:25:23.640 --> 3:25:27.240]  no don't seem to recall that either oh no i forgot the righteous
[3:25:27.240 --> 3:25:30.360]  moral western countries are all arming Saudi Arabia
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:33.800]  and turning a blind eye to the horrors they're inflicting on Yemen
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:37.320]  we don't talk about that war so while congressman Eric Swalwell wants
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:40.840]  russian students expelled from the u.s entirely the
[3:25:40.840 --> 3:25:44.760]  Saudi students will continue to pour in whenever there's an Islamic terror attack
[3:25:44.760 --> 3:25:48.360]  the left's first reaction is to fret and wet the bed
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:51.720]  about Islamophobia not only are individual Muslims
[3:25:51.720 --> 3:25:55.320]  not punished for the actions of others which of course they shouldn't be
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:25:58.840]  but an entire apology a cottage industry kicks into
[3:25:58.840 --> 3:26:02.600]  shield any of those groups from any scrutiny whatsoever
[3:26:02.600 --> 3:26:06.440]  not with russians though despite the fact that the vast vast majority have
[3:26:06.440 --> 3:26:09.880]  absolutely nothing to do with Putin or this war
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:14.120]  wonder why that is let me know in the comment this isn't just stigmatization
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:19.160]  it's vile demonization on a scale not witnessed in generations russians are
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:22.760]  like the new anti-vaxxers most of the people on the receiving end of this
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:26.680]  vitriol aren't kremlin stooges they're not rich oligarchs
[3:26:26.680 --> 3:26:30.120]  they're just russians it's xenophobic immoral
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:37.160]  an utterly utterly pointless self-defeating and stupid
[3:26:37.160 --> 3:26:40.520]  again remember the outcry when trump tried to ban
[3:26:40.520 --> 3:26:45.320]  immigration from certain countries which weren't even the most populist muslim
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:51.560]  countries by the way absolute meltdown i have democratic congressman calling for
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:57.400]  russians to be expelled you have british MPs calling for all russians period
[3:26:57.400 --> 3:27:01.320]  to be kicked out of the country just because of the they were born on a
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:06.920]  piece of land called russia where's the cries of xenophobia now
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:11.400]  but as i mentioned there in the video people in the ukraine prominent ukraine
[3:27:11.400 --> 3:27:14.040]  activists are actually demanding that ea sports
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:19.560]  ban russian kids from playing fifa that's going to stop the tanks
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:23.080]  but they've banned russian teams from video games that's the headline out of
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:26.520]  summit news ea sports bans russian teams from video games
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:31.480]  they've banned computer code graphics of russian
[3:27:31.480 --> 3:27:37.160]  football players in fifa that will stop the war machine key has been saved
[3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:42.440]  forget the peace talks doesn't matter it's all over the war is over because
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:49.160]  ea sports has banned a computer code of a graphic of russian football players
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:54.440]  absolutely mental video game company ea sports has
[3:27:54.440 --> 3:27:58.440]  announced it will remove all russian teams from its games in solidarity with
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:28:02.200]  the ukrainian people yeah because i'm sure when my house
[3:28:02.200 --> 3:28:06.120]  is being shelled and i'm cowering in a bunker
[3:28:06.120 --> 3:28:10.120]  with my kids with the sound of explosions all around me
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:15.080]  the one thing that gives me comfort the one thing that gives me
[3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:19.560]  a sense of belonging a sense of safety in that hellish moment
[3:28:19.560 --> 3:28:23.320]  is the thought that ea sports has banned
[3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:27.720]  some computer code some graphics in a friggin video game
[3:28:27.720 --> 3:28:32.360]  that's going to give me a lot of comfort while the bombs are raining down
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:37.160]  that thought that russian that graphics of russian football players
[3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:43.960]  won't appear in fifa 22 well that just you might as well just end the war now
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:47.880]  no point in peace talks no point in ceasefire
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:28:52.600]  that has ended this war it's over something that news we'll be back
[3:28:52.600 --> 3:28:54.840]  as always
[3:28:55.480 --> 3:29:00.520]  has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:03.880]  is the truth then the next big casualty
[3:29:03.880 --> 3:29:08.680]  isn't even the people that died no that invariably follows
[3:29:08.680 --> 3:29:12.600]  but first there is the crackdown on populations
[3:29:12.600 --> 3:29:16.920]  basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[3:29:16.920 --> 3:29:20.280]  and now across the world from the united states to europe
[3:29:20.280 --> 3:29:24.440]  legislations being introduced that if you
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:31.160]  amplify any quote pro russian information you can be censored
[3:29:31.160 --> 3:29:34.840]  you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now
[3:29:34.840 --> 3:29:38.360]  canada's under this legislation that if you have a
[3:29:38.360 --> 3:29:42.600]  fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage
[3:29:42.600 --> 3:29:46.680]  in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested
[3:29:46.680 --> 3:29:49.960]  ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is being carried out by the
[3:29:49.960 --> 3:29:53.080]  globalists around the world against humanity that makes them
[3:29:53.080 --> 3:29:57.080]  fours dot com more important than ever the globalist social
[3:29:57.080 --> 3:30:02.760]  engineers always intended to push their coveted biomedical tyranny
[3:30:02.760 --> 3:30:06.600]  lockdowns until the populations rebelled
[3:30:06.600 --> 3:30:10.440]  they would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law
[3:30:10.440 --> 3:30:14.120]  and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out
[3:30:14.120 --> 3:30:18.040]  against their lives but because of so many scientists and engineers and
[3:30:18.040 --> 3:30:22.200]  researchers and others coming public and and whistleblowers
[3:30:22.200 --> 3:30:26.360]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[3:30:26.360 --> 3:30:30.520]  that it is a world government corporate takeover
[3:30:30.520 --> 3:30:33.800]  and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever
[3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:37.160]  the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up
[3:30:37.160 --> 3:30:40.760]  on their takeover like canada but they've now declared
[3:30:40.760 --> 3:30:44.200]  a civil emergency and martial law in ontario
[3:30:44.200 --> 3:30:47.320]  and other areas of the world are following suit like australia
[3:30:47.320 --> 3:30:51.480]  so pray for these folks big time this is a very serious situation and stay
[3:30:51.480 --> 3:30:55.480]  tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely bare-mouth

[3:32:57.880 --> 3:33:02.440]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[3:33:02.440 --> 3:33:18.360]  it's alex jones
[3:33:18.360 --> 3:33:34.280]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dark news
[3:33:37.720 --> 3:33:43.240]  so we joke about the um Siberian camps being cancelled we joke about the
[3:33:43.240 --> 3:33:46.840]  Dostoyevsky course being cancelled at milan university
[3:33:46.840 --> 3:33:50.840]  we don't joke about the conductor of the munich philharmonica having his life
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:33:55.400]  basically cancelled his career ruined over the fact that he's russian
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:34:00.280]  russians now in the metro subway by the way headline apple and google payment
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:04.680]  systems block russians causing chaos in moscow metro system
[3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:09.560]  this is what they want they want us all off the cash they want cashless society
[3:34:09.560 --> 3:34:15.320]  they want life to be lived and for us to engage in commerce purely via the qr
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:20.680]  code which i'm guilty of doing paying for stuff via a qr code
[3:34:20.680 --> 3:34:24.120]  you know that now when social media networks ban you by the way such as
[3:34:24.120 --> 3:34:27.640]  tiktok they don't just ban your account they ban
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:31.720]  your device you can no longer use that phone
[3:34:31.720 --> 3:34:35.000]  to start a new account when your old one gets banned
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:38.600]  when that system is completely normalized with the qr code
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:44.040]  your device gets banned your device is unable to scan the qr code
[3:34:44.040 --> 3:34:48.840]  the qr code is mandatory to purchase everything
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:52.360]  but your device has been banned because you posted a spicy tweet
[3:34:52.360 --> 3:34:58.440]  about i don't know aoc or whatever you've said a naughty word on facebook
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:03.720]  you get a seven day suspension no purchases for seven days
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:07.400]  you go really far and you say something like diversity is in the strength you
[3:35:07.400 --> 3:35:10.520]  get banned for good basically you're homeless you can't get a
[3:35:10.520 --> 3:35:14.040]  mortgage you can't get a job forget about it
[3:35:14.040 --> 3:35:18.200]  this is our collective social credit score future
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:22.440]  and ordinary russians traveling in the moscow metro
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:28.200]  not rich oligarchs not putin kremlin stewgers ordinary russians are now
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:32.200]  bearing the brunt of this collectivized tyranny this
[3:35:32.200 --> 3:35:35.000]  punishment russians are attempting to use apple
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:37.720]  pay and google pay found their access had been blocked
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:42.360]  causing chaos in the moscow metro system thankfully
[3:35:42.360 --> 3:35:48.280]  unlike in the west apple pay and google pay are relatively rare but it still
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:51.800]  caused massive cues people had to fumble around for cash
[3:35:51.800 --> 3:35:54.600]  because a certain percentage of people in russia
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:35:59.880]  do use those payment systems on their phone to access public transport
[3:35:59.880 --> 3:36:05.720]  and again this is because bank cards banks in russia have been completely
[3:36:05.720 --> 3:36:11.240]  de-platformed under this swift ban so now ordinary russians with ordinary
[3:36:11.240 --> 3:36:15.160]  current accounts hard-working working-class russians
[3:36:15.160 --> 3:36:18.920]  they live in what you could call a dictatorship they don't support it
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:22.760]  they just live in it they suffer under it they have to get along with their lives
[3:36:22.760 --> 3:36:26.680]  but no we're punishing them now because they have bank accounts with these
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:30.360]  russian banks that have been banned so now google pay
[3:36:30.360 --> 3:36:33.400]  samsung pay and apple pay said no we're severing
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:39.400]  all connection with any russian banks so now your ordinary hard-working
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:44.600]  individual in moscow struggles to get on a public transport
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:49.800]  this is where it's going but again didn't happen to saudi arabians did it
[3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:53.240]  their government has been bombarding yemen with nato
[3:36:53.240 --> 3:36:59.480]  us and uk weapons for years killing hundreds of thousands of civilians
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:03.400]  what impact did that have on saudi citizens non
[3:37:03.400 --> 3:37:07.560]  whatsoever and yet now we're seeing tweets from professors
[3:37:07.560 --> 3:37:11.240]  i saw mike cernovich was highlighting it on his twitter earlier
[3:37:11.240 --> 3:37:14.040]  where professors in the united states are saying
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:18.840]  it doesn't matter you have to openly denounce putin and basically become an
[3:37:18.840 --> 3:37:23.480]  activist for globo homo ukraine movement you have to change your
[3:37:23.480 --> 3:37:26.920]  twitter bio to put a ukraine flag in it if you don't do all that if you don't
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:29.560]  prostrate yourself if you don't ideologically
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:33.560]  ideologically conform you are putin's bitch
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:37.560]  you are on the side of the kremlin and they're saying those people should be
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:43.480]  deported should be putting gulags again as i said in the video russians are
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:47.560]  basically the new january 6 enemy combatants
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:51.800]  they're the new anti-vaxxers they're the new unvaccinated
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:56.680]  any excuse to discriminate against people on mass to engage in
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:00.040]  open xenophobia because they don't agree with this on
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:04.760]  certain political issues again this is this is the be kinder crowd
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:09.320]  in action once again saying that people should be expelled from countries
[3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:12.360]  saying that people should be stripped of their assets
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:17.160]  have their assets frozen as we saw with the truckers in canada
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:21.400]  simply because of their beliefs not just because of their beliefs because they
[3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:27.560]  refrain from expressing vehemently the belief that they demand you express
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:33.080]  you can't even remain silent anymore you have to submit and show that you're
[3:38:33.080 --> 3:38:36.600]  submitting otherwise you are subject to
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:40.840]  cancellation let's go to this other video now
[3:38:40.840 --> 3:38:45.080]  because i've got another massive example of it i put this out on youtube a couple
[3:38:45.080 --> 3:38:47.960]  of days ago but again i'm going to come back and give you another example of
[3:38:47.960 --> 3:38:51.400]  this the video is first casualty of war is truth
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:55.720]  going through just a few of the examples flagrant
[3:38:55.720 --> 3:38:59.480]  giant fabricated news stories and yet the
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:04.200]  esteemed fact checkers are strangely able first casualty of war
[3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:07.560]  is truth here's the clip first casualty of war
[3:39:07.560 --> 3:39:11.480]  is truth boy is that old adage proven correct in the past few days
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:16.120]  russia deploys mobile crematoriums to hide evidence of battlefield
[3:39:16.120 --> 3:39:21.000]  casualties stench of death chilling pics reveal russia's mobile crematoriums
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:24.440]  used to incinerate dead soldiers in high true scale of ukraine war
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:28.280]  turns out the pictures are from a 2013 youtube video posted by a russian
[3:39:28.280 --> 3:39:32.600]  incinerator construction company and they're incinerating a trash bag
[3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:36.200]  whoops ukrainian soldier on snake island tells russian officer to go
[3:39:36.200 --> 3:39:39.880]  expletive yourself before being killed russian warship go fuck yourself
[3:39:39.880 --> 3:39:43.400]  these guards on a ukrainian island refuse to surrender before being killed by
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:46.360]  Putin troops ukrainian soldiers told russian officer go fuck
[3:39:46.360 --> 3:39:51.000]  yourself before they died on island uh they weren't killed and here's a video
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:54.600]  of them peacefully surrendering ukraine island defenders who told russian navy
[3:39:54.600 --> 3:39:58.680]  go fuck yourself may still be alive whoops ukraine president fighting on the
[3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:03.160]  front lines 24th of february 2022 ukraine president inspecting
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:05.560]  border 9th of april 2021
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:10.920]  hmm whoops the ghost of Kiev has a name and he has absolutely owned the russian
[3:40:10.920 --> 3:40:14.760]  air force godspeed and more killed samuel who wants to tell him
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:20.200]  that's a meme featuring the comedian sam hide same guy who builds himself as a
[3:40:20.200 --> 3:40:24.360]  slayer of conspiracy theories posting more old images as if they're new
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:27.720]  whoops russian tanks running over innocent drivers
[3:40:27.720 --> 3:40:31.480]  since that the tank is ukrainian whoops you think the fact checkers would be in
[3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:34.120]  their element the past week should have been an absolute
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:37.320]  bonanza for them and yet they're strangely a wall
[3:40:37.320 --> 3:40:41.320]  yeah funny that isn't it almost like fact checkers are just a vanguard of
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:46.280]  biased partisan political interests surely not when the fog of war becomes a
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:49.480]  regional sandstorm you don't have to be a russian
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:53.560]  stooge or a conspiracy theorist to see the blindingly obvious
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:56.680]  why should we trust a legacy media in a political class
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:02.360]  that has lied about the circumstances behind every conflict in modern history
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:05.960]  almost certainly lied about the origin of the pandemic
[3:41:05.960 --> 3:41:10.120]  and has just spent the last two years dangerously misleading the public
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:14.360]  about lockdowns and silencing anyone who challenged their narrative
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:17.960]  i don't worry they may have done all that but when it comes to this you can
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:21.960]  trust them honest really i don't trust anyone i
[3:41:21.960 --> 3:41:24.840]  don't trust the russians and i don't trust them
[3:41:24.840 --> 3:41:28.280]  retaining a sense of nuance a shred of incredulity
[3:41:28.280 --> 3:41:32.520]  and an ounce of critical thinking doesn't make you a russian stooge or a
[3:41:32.520 --> 3:41:39.160]  kremlin asset it makes you a normal human being
[3:41:39.160 --> 3:41:42.680]  so again we have this narrative in the west
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:46.680]  where rt and all these other russian networks are literally being just shot
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:50.600]  off entirely the russian rt youtube channel is blocked
[3:41:50.600 --> 3:41:53.880]  for people in europe i don't know what it is in america but i can't even
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:58.920]  access it without vpn they wiped rt off british television
[3:41:58.920 --> 3:42:04.520]  and they're saying oh it's because we need independent impartial information
[3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:09.480]  and they engage in propaganda like the wet the nato powers on engaging in
[3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:13.800]  propaganda give me a break numerous examples
[3:42:13.800 --> 3:42:21.080]  in one week alone massive contrived fabricated fake news stories
[3:42:21.080 --> 3:42:25.160]  breathlessly hysterically amplified by the mainstream media
[3:42:25.160 --> 3:42:31.080]  all of which turned out to be complete bs and they're saying that rt
[3:42:31.080 --> 3:42:34.120]  needs to be shut off because they engage in propaganda
[3:42:34.120 --> 3:42:37.640]  so what are the consequences for you engaging in propaganda
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:44.040]  flagrantly with no corrections five six seven major fabricated stories in the
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:47.800]  space of one week alone what's going to happen to bvc
[3:42:47.800 --> 3:42:52.120]  cnn nothing absolutely nothing they can lie
[3:42:52.120 --> 3:42:56.600]  and say they're not engaging in propaganda incredible
[3:42:56.600 --> 3:43:00.280]  it's hard to believe that we're already into march
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:05.800]  2022 and in the month of february we had a very popular sale that was going
[3:43:05.800 --> 3:43:10.120]  of our flagship product x3 that has all three types
[3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:13.400]  of the amazing iodine your body needs for every
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:17.160]  electrochemical cellular activity in your body
[3:43:17.160 --> 3:43:20.680]  your immune system your stamina your libido so much
[3:43:20.680 --> 3:43:22.920]  and the majority of the population of the world
[3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:26.840]  is iodine deficient this is the very best iodine output so
[3:43:26.840 --> 3:43:30.680]  we had on sale 50 off but we sold more than half of what we have
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:34.120]  or isn't going to come in for a long time so i took it back to
[3:43:34.120 --> 3:43:37.560]  full process i was just thinking you know what we need to funds in now to
[3:43:37.560 --> 3:43:40.200]  stay on air plus this is a great product everybody
[3:43:40.200 --> 3:43:43.800]  needs so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence
[3:43:43.800 --> 3:43:47.080]  get x3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast
[3:43:47.080 --> 3:43:52.040]  i'm going to keep it at 50 off until it sells out get x3 right now exclusively
[3:43:52.040 --> 3:43:57.000]  at infowarstore.com for 50 off
[3:43:57.560 --> 3:44:07.000]  what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[3:44:07.000 --> 3:44:27.960]  no
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:37.620] 탊고같이 Audrey99 is theגֳֳֳֳֳ very
[3:44:37.620 --> 3:44:52.080]  dark
[3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:53.080]  That's infowarstore.com.
[3:44:53.080 --> 3:45:01.600]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock, infowarstore.com, and they will
[3:45:01.600 --> 3:45:05.320]  sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it
[3:45:05.320 --> 3:45:06.320]  at full price.
[3:45:06.320 --> 3:45:11.000]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son or getting
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are, and I believe you will then get
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:20.760]  hooked on them like myself and my family and the crew are.
[3:45:20.760 --> 3:45:26.440]  So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and one or son, they are 50%
[3:45:26.440 --> 3:45:31.960]  off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price I would estimate
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:33.440]  in less than a month.
[3:45:33.440 --> 3:45:37.840]  So, this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens or the bad halogens.
[3:45:37.840 --> 3:45:42.440]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your muses as
[3:45:42.440 --> 3:45:43.440]  well.
[3:45:43.440 --> 3:45:45.440]  They're amazing and they're at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:45.440 --> 3:45:49.680]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation.
[3:45:49.680 --> 3:45:51.240]  I need funds to run the operation.
[3:45:51.240 --> 3:45:52.240]  You need to be healthy.
[3:45:52.240 --> 3:45:53.240]  We need to stay on air.
[3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:54.240]  It's a match made in heaven.
[3:45:54.240 --> 3:45:55.240]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[3:45:55.240 --> 3:46:00.760]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[3:46:00.760 --> 3:46:06.120]  Now, if you read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gain of function
[3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:11.560]  deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:14.080]  involving influenza, MERS, and ZARS viruses.
[3:46:14.080 --> 3:46:18.080]  There's nothing about ZARS-like viruses and it's a research funding pause.
[3:46:18.080 --> 3:46:20.080]  It's not a stop.
[3:46:20.080 --> 3:46:21.080]  It's not a prohibition.
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:23.360]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign.
[3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:24.360]  You stop.
[3:46:24.360 --> 3:46:25.360]  You look both ways.
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:26.360]  And then you proceed.
[3:46:26.360 --> 3:46:30.480]  And so, it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function.
[3:46:30.480 --> 3:46:34.840]  But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research.
[3:46:34.840 --> 3:46:37.880]  So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[3:46:37.880 --> 3:46:40.640]  They don't quite know what they're talking about, calling it gain of function.
[3:46:40.640 --> 3:46:42.480]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:43.480]  That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:48.040]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[3:46:48.040 --> 3:46:51.280]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[3:46:51.280 --> 3:46:53.920]  You're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[3:46:53.920 --> 3:46:54.920]  Thank you, Mike.
[3:46:54.920 --> 3:46:57.440]  We love you.
[3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:08.600]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:08.600 --> 3:47:18.800]  We're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:18.800 --> 3:47:23.200]  So it's quite ironic that RT and Sputnik and all these other Russian networks have been
[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:24.920]  banned in the UK.
[3:47:24.920 --> 3:47:27.280]  They've literally wiped them off UK television.
[3:47:27.280 --> 3:47:32.560]  RT has been on UK television for about 15 years, 12, 15 years.
[3:47:32.560 --> 3:47:34.320]  It's completely wiped off.
[3:47:34.320 --> 3:47:38.240]  You can't even access their YouTube channel without a VPN.
[3:47:38.240 --> 3:47:42.880]  And going on their website, it's not even like it's vehement pro-Putin propaganda from
[3:47:42.880 --> 3:47:44.560]  what I've seen.
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:51.360]  On the flip side, however, you literally have about eight massive, fake, contrived fabricated
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:54.680]  news stories, the ghost of Kiev.
[3:47:54.680 --> 3:47:59.080]  The idea that the Ukrainian president was in his battle gear on the front lines.
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:03.080]  They used old pictures from a year ago.
[3:48:03.080 --> 3:48:08.560]  The mobile Russian incinerators used to hide evidence of war crimes.
[3:48:08.560 --> 3:48:12.680]  All absolute complete BS.
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:18.120]  And yet what the consequences for CNN, for Fox News, for BBC, who all reported those
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:25.640]  stories breathlessly, with no correction whatsoever, confirmed beyond doubt to be absolute fake
[3:48:25.640 --> 3:48:26.640]  news.
[3:48:26.640 --> 3:48:31.880]  This idea that Russian warship destroyed an island and massacred a bunch of Ukrainian
[3:48:31.880 --> 3:48:36.480]  soldiers, they all surrendered in this video of it.
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:38.440]  Who's engaging in propaganda?
[3:48:38.440 --> 3:48:41.080]  The answer is both sides.
[3:48:41.080 --> 3:48:44.800]  So when is the BBC going to get D platform from YouTube?
[3:48:44.800 --> 3:48:48.000]  When is CNN going to get D platform blocked on YouTube?
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:48:49.800]  Answer is never.
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:51.720]  Because you know, they're the good guys.
[3:48:51.720 --> 3:48:52.720]  They're the good guys.
[3:48:52.720 --> 3:48:56.560]  We have another example of that today.
[3:48:56.560 --> 3:49:03.120]  Babiyar Holocaust Memorial unscathed according to Israeli journalists, oh, but I was told
[3:49:03.120 --> 3:49:07.080]  it had been destroyed by the anti-Semitic Russian forces.
[3:49:07.080 --> 3:49:12.640]  I was told that Putin's claim that they were fighting Nazis was completely debunked by
[3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:16.440]  the fact that they just destroyed a Holocaust Memorial.
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:19.480]  Turns out it never frigging happened.
[3:49:19.480 --> 3:49:21.600]  Imagine my shock.
[3:49:21.600 --> 3:49:26.800]  The Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky, claimed that Russia had attacked the Babiyar
[3:49:26.800 --> 3:49:31.920]  Holocaust Memorial in Kiev in an attempt to, quote, erase our history.
[3:49:31.920 --> 3:49:35.920]  He literally said that they killed Jews twice.
[3:49:35.920 --> 3:49:36.920]  And but I don't know.
[3:49:36.920 --> 3:49:40.720]  It's only RT doing propaganda now where you can trust us.
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:46.040]  An Israeli journalist visited the site to discover that it was in fact, quote, unscathed.
[3:49:46.040 --> 3:49:50.320]  They went to the site, took a bunch of photographs, it turns out that the Russians had attacked
[3:49:50.320 --> 3:49:53.920]  a nearby television tower network.
[3:49:53.920 --> 3:49:56.080]  The bombs hadn't dropped on the memorial.
[3:49:56.080 --> 3:49:57.800]  It was completely untouched.
[3:49:57.800 --> 3:50:03.040]  Oh, but we need to ban RT because they engage in propaganda.
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:08.200]  Legacy media outlets breathlessly reported on Monday that the memorial had been deliberately
[3:50:08.200 --> 3:50:13.120]  attacked by an airstrike amplifying Zelensky's claim that the destruction was, quote, beyond
[3:50:13.120 --> 3:50:14.120]  humanity.
[3:50:14.120 --> 3:50:16.160]  Nothing happened there.
[3:50:16.160 --> 3:50:17.160]  No one was killed.
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:22.120]  It hasn't got a dent in it, quote.
[3:50:22.120 --> 3:50:23.640]  This is what he said.
[3:50:23.640 --> 3:50:28.240]  The Russians have orders to erase our history, our country and all of us Zelensky said, you
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:31.520]  killed Holocaust victims for the second time.
[3:50:31.520 --> 3:50:37.720]  Yeah, he actually said that the monument is completely untouched.
[3:50:37.720 --> 3:50:42.040]  And again, if there if Russia is trying to erase Ukrainian history, they could do it
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:43.720]  pretty easily.
[3:50:43.720 --> 3:50:49.080]  Why are they claiming that this is Russia erasing Ukrainian history when it didn't happen?
[3:50:49.080 --> 3:50:53.520]  I mean, you're not really building up much credibility for your own side when you're
[3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:57.000]  outright lying about attacks that never happened.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:00.520]  Why net Israeli journalists went and visited it?
[3:51:00.520 --> 3:51:05.040]  This is not an RT Sputnik journalist that went and visited it and said, no, it hasn't
[3:51:05.040 --> 3:51:06.040]  been attacked.
[3:51:06.040 --> 3:51:09.000]  This is a Jewish Israeli journalist.
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:16.440]  Quote, the memorial was not harmed, no bomb missile or artillery shell hit the site itself.
[3:51:16.440 --> 3:51:23.240]  Why net news reported the damage was caused to nearby Kiev's communications and television
[3:51:23.240 --> 3:51:32.080]  tower, 984 feet away from the new memorial, the kilometer 3280 feet from the old one.
[3:51:32.080 --> 3:51:39.480]  As Israeli journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, not RT, not Sputnik, visited the site on Wednesday
[3:51:39.480 --> 3:51:44.040]  to take photographs discovering the memorial was in fact unscathed.
[3:51:44.040 --> 3:51:50.200]  But then you go through the hysterical reporting from the media from two days ago, Zelensky
[3:51:50.200 --> 3:51:55.280]  condemns Russian missile attack on Holocaust Memorial beyond humanity, damn them, box
[3:51:55.280 --> 3:51:56.280]  news.
[3:51:56.280 --> 3:52:00.960]  USA Today, Russian airstrike hits well known Holocaust Memorial in Ukraine, killing at
[3:52:00.960 --> 3:52:08.720]  least five, didn't hit the Holocaust Memorial, not a den in it, lies, oh RT needs to be banned
[3:52:08.720 --> 3:52:19.480]  for propaganda, Kiev, CNN, Kiev hit with rockets targeting Holocaust Memorial, didn't happen.
[3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:26.680]  USA Today, again, Jake Tapper tweeted what better way for Putin to prove his ridiculous
[3:52:26.680 --> 3:52:31.600]  claims of denazification than by attacking a country with a popular elected Jewish president
[3:52:31.600 --> 3:52:38.160]  followed by bombing a Holocaust Memorial, didn't happen, no retraction from Jake Tapper.
[3:52:38.160 --> 3:52:42.920]  Lawrence Tribe, a Russian missile hit the Babiyar Holocaust Memorial site in Kiev today,
[3:52:42.920 --> 3:52:46.480]  no it friggin didn't, didn't happen.
[3:52:46.480 --> 3:52:53.720]  So again, they've been caught lying numerous times about these massive fabricated emotional
[3:52:53.720 --> 3:52:59.600]  fake news stories, what's the consequence, none whatsoever.
[3:52:59.600 --> 3:53:02.560]  Let's go to this final video now.
[3:53:02.560 --> 3:53:09.160]  Because the head of MI6, the head of the British spies, James Bond, responded to the Russian
[3:53:09.160 --> 3:53:15.520]  attack on Ukraine last week by coming out and saying that the main issue was to continue
[3:53:15.520 --> 3:53:17.840]  to defend LGBT rights.
[3:53:17.840 --> 3:53:18.840]  Here's the clip.
[3:53:18.840 --> 3:53:23.880]  While ballistic missiles rained down on Ukraine, while soldiers and tanks began to pour across
[3:53:23.880 --> 3:53:29.440]  the border, while Vladimir Putin's forces advanced on Kiev, what was the British Ministry
[3:53:29.440 --> 3:53:35.360]  of Defence doing, virtue signalling on Twitter about a gay coffee morning, no I'm not exaggerating,
[3:53:35.360 --> 3:53:37.520]  this is the tweet they later deleted.
[3:53:37.520 --> 3:53:43.160]  Today for LGBT History Month we hosted a coffee morning in main building which had a great
[3:53:43.160 --> 3:53:49.000]  turnout, in the afternoon we hosted a book club webinar, where we discussed our favourite
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:51.920]  LGBT plus books, that is your favourite book and why.
[3:53:51.920 --> 3:53:55.240]  Then the definitions of asexual and pansexual.
[3:53:55.240 --> 3:54:01.000]  Wow Kiev is saved, Putin's turned back the tanks, bear in mind, this is the Ministry
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:06.320]  of Defence, the headquarters of the British armed forces, but it gets worse, it always
[3:54:06.320 --> 3:54:07.320]  gets worse.
[3:54:07.320 --> 3:54:12.200]  The Times reports, British spies have been encouraged to consider their right privilege
[3:54:12.200 --> 3:54:18.160]  and avoid gendered terms such as manpower in a guide to improving diversity and inclusion
[3:54:18.160 --> 3:54:19.920]  in the security services.
[3:54:19.920 --> 3:54:26.440]  The leaked document also advises MI5 and MI6 officers not to use words such as strong
[3:54:26.440 --> 3:54:31.760]  and grip, because they can quote, reinforce dominant cultural patterns.
[3:54:31.760 --> 3:54:36.480]  The advice titled Mission Critical was thought to have been written by Sir Stephen Lovegrove,
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:41.480]  the National Security Advisor in October, and to have raised concern in other areas
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:42.480]  of government.
[3:54:42.480 --> 3:54:45.720]  Critics have argued that security officials should have been less focused on inclusion
[3:54:45.720 --> 3:54:48.320]  and more alert to events in Afghanistan and Ukraine.
[3:54:48.320 --> 3:54:53.320]  Oh really dear thing, there I was hoping the Kremlin would have abandoned their onslaught,
[3:54:53.320 --> 3:54:58.040]  terrified at the mere prospect of James Bond turning up and catching them in the act of
[3:54:58.040 --> 3:55:00.160]  using misogynistic rhetoric.
[3:55:00.160 --> 3:55:04.560]  Meanwhile, the British government responded to the bombardment of Ukraine, by lighting
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:08.040]  up Downing Street in yellow and baby blue.
[3:55:08.040 --> 3:55:12.800]  According to Ukrainian flags in a Twitter BIOS, this will definitely stop Putin's war
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:13.800]  machine.
[3:55:13.800 --> 3:55:14.800]  Have we settled on a hashtag yet?
[3:55:14.800 --> 3:55:16.840]  We're in big trouble.
[3:55:16.840 --> 3:55:20.400]  Big trouble.
[3:55:20.400 --> 3:55:26.720]  So following the head of MI6 as assertion that LGBT rights in Ukraine is probably the most
[3:55:26.720 --> 3:55:32.080]  important issue in this entire war, we have this headline, CBS highlights problem of transgender
[3:55:32.080 --> 3:55:33.800]  acceptance in Ukraine.
[3:55:33.800 --> 3:55:38.080]  CBS News responded to the Russian bombardment of Ukraine by highlighting little discussed
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:44.640]  but hugely important issue, how transgender acceptance isn't widespread in the country.
[3:55:44.640 --> 3:55:48.920]  Maybe it deserves to be bombed then if it's that bigoted.
[3:55:48.920 --> 3:55:52.600]  According to the reports, transgenders are fighting a war within a war.
[3:55:52.600 --> 3:55:58.360]  The report featured an interview with a transgender individual in which he, she, she said the
[3:55:58.360 --> 3:56:04.120]  threat of being bombed is compounded by Ukraine not being a very rainbow friendly place and
[3:56:04.120 --> 3:56:06.960]  isn't that the most important thing.
[3:56:06.960 --> 3:56:12.640]  Meanwhile, GB News reports UK couple paint their house in colours of Ukraine flag.
[3:56:12.640 --> 3:56:13.640]  That's it.
[3:56:13.640 --> 3:56:14.640]  Stick a fork in it.
[3:56:14.640 --> 3:56:15.640]  It's done.
[3:56:15.640 --> 3:56:16.640]  Putin surrendered.
[3:56:16.640 --> 3:56:23.360]  The tank's heading back to Moscow because this couple, this middle class ditzy couple
[3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:28.440]  in Cambridge, England wanted to show their support for friends in Ukraine and for the
[3:56:28.440 --> 3:56:32.000]  Ukrainian people in this crisis.
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:37.280]  Now they could have donated the money that they spend on painting their entire house
[3:56:37.280 --> 3:56:45.240]  blue and yellow to a Ukrainian charity to feed refugees and people under bombardment.
[3:56:45.240 --> 3:56:50.800]  But no, that wouldn't have been important enough for them to get their faces in a news
[3:56:50.800 --> 3:56:55.920]  story, would it, and to engage in moral exhibitionism.
[3:56:55.920 --> 3:57:02.120]  So instead, rend plattings and our husband, Michael, used two five-litre tubs of paint
[3:57:02.120 --> 3:57:08.240]  on yellow and one one blue, costing £76 in total, that's about $100, to decorate the
[3:57:08.240 --> 3:57:14.680]  house of their home in Cambridge on Sunday and they made sure everybody knew about it.
[3:57:14.680 --> 3:57:17.880]  Mr. Mrs. Plating said it was my husband's idea.
[3:57:17.880 --> 3:57:21.280]  He just assumed other people would have done it anyway, yeah.
[3:57:21.280 --> 3:57:25.240]  I'm sure everyone's rushing to paint their houses yellow and blue, that's really going
[3:57:25.240 --> 3:57:27.880]  to increase their value, isn't it?
[3:57:27.880 --> 3:57:32.120]  So they decided to do this, they could have given the money to a Ukrainian charity to
