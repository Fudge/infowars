[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:33.400]  we've got a lot of conflicting reports out of france nbc news and others reported that several
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.360]  suspects have been shot and shoot out turned out that wasn't true now they say one of the
[00:37.360 --> 00:42.960]  younger of the three is turn themselves in bloomberg and others are reporting with the
[00:42.960 --> 00:49.360]  video clips we have them coming up but we already knew that isis or al-qaeda by a new name they
[00:49.360 --> 00:56.960]  fly the same flags fall the same well hobbyist ideology a week before about five days before
[00:56.960 --> 01:06.320]  the attacks of yesterday called in their weekly video for attacks inside france and we have
[01:06.320 --> 01:15.680]  those jihadi videos coming up today here's the headline islamic state video threatened jihad
[01:15.680 --> 01:26.400]  on france that is from bloomberg third french police officer killed his terror suspects reportedly
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.320]  spotted a female police officer was shot turns out the police officer who begged for his life
[01:32.320 --> 01:36.960]  said don't shoot in english people keep asking why do you say in english because that's the
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.600]  international language he was guessing they might be foreigners so he said don't shoot don't shoot
[01:41.600 --> 01:48.720]  and they shot him in the head he was a muslim so that shows right there how there is a major
[01:48.720 --> 01:54.720]  rift in islam and i'm not here as an apologist for islam or here is an attacker of islam
[01:54.720 --> 02:00.240]  i'm just trying to state the facts here that that most muslims are not radicals that want to
[02:00.240 --> 02:06.640]  run and you know want to run around and kill everybody but they are bullied basically by
[02:06.640 --> 02:14.560]  the quote extremist and by saudi arabia and others that are trying to export radical brands of islam
[02:14.560 --> 02:19.840]  with state department help around the world to destabilize areas they want to take over
[02:19.840 --> 02:27.680]  radical islam is the type of shock force that they use speaking of that amad salam i'm really
[02:27.680 --> 02:37.440]  excited about this big interview who was the fbi informant and he was with the egyptian cia who
[02:37.440 --> 02:43.360]  infiltrated the mosque that was planning to blow up the world trade center and then the fbi basically
[02:43.360 --> 02:49.680]  had salam helped them build a real bomb despite his protest then gave him real detonators he tried
[02:49.680 --> 02:54.480]  to stop the bombing and was told to stand down he knew he was being set up so he recorded the fbi
[02:54.480 --> 03:00.480]  famously the tapes have been released shane go ahead he was given a big settlement in that as
[03:00.480 --> 03:05.920]  well by the federal government when when they try to demonize him and he had the evidence
[03:05.920 --> 03:13.120]  he is a listener of the broadcast and i'm excited that he's going to be coming on
[03:15.600 --> 03:20.800]  the broadcast he sent me this about six months ago to alex hoping that one day we can talk
[03:20.800 --> 03:27.360]  about salam he is going to be coming on the broadcast today inside false flag tear
[03:28.240 --> 03:34.400]  because it's still false flag if you go find a bunch of crazy jihadis and then open every door
[03:34.400 --> 03:41.440]  for them and cook them a bomb and give them detonators by the grace of god the two idiots
[03:41.440 --> 03:45.760]  they had parked the truck did not park it where they were told or could have taken out one of the
[03:45.760 --> 03:49.920]  main support columns and brought down one of the world trade center towers you know that happened
[03:49.920 --> 04:00.640]  again nine years later in 2001 september 11th this is a big interview with a mod salon the
[04:00.640 --> 04:08.640]  untold story of al qaeda the fbi and the cia in america this is the stuff hollywood movies

[04:28.480 --> 04:36.480]  smokescreened via the attacks in paris but the attacks in paris are important because they reveal
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.520]  that we now have cbs news bloomberg ap roiders singing and i've got all the clips here all the
[04:41.520 --> 04:48.640]  articles saying oh my gosh isis is so horrible they're behind the attack in paris isis is al qaeda
[04:50.000 --> 04:57.440]  and it was funded and and given new life by the west in the last four years in the middle east
[04:58.880 --> 05:03.600]  the government's department of homeland security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time the

[08:49.520 --> 09:00.240]  from the beginning to cause balkanization to cause neo segregation that the state then referees
[09:00.240 --> 09:08.560]  this is the fort foundation socialist cloward and piven great game divide and conquer
[09:10.400 --> 09:19.760]  balkanization program writ large and there's now music videos the suspect shooters in france
[09:20.560 --> 09:27.840]  are involved in glorifying bringing down french culture you got to love the french socialist
[09:27.840 --> 09:34.880]  socialist open up the borders bring in giant populations foreigner populations now about
[09:34.880 --> 09:40.000]  half of the french population and then they want to bring down what's left of france and
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.760]  don't worry it will collapse and the big banks will suck it dry and move on like they've done to
[09:45.760 --> 09:53.840]  countless other countries you have a synthetic globalist corporate plastic culture that will
[09:53.840 --> 10:02.160]  not allow anyone to have their own culture unless it is a dirt floored women being raped being put
[10:02.160 --> 10:08.800]  into sex slavery heads chopped off burning mosques burning churches burning synagogues radical
[10:08.800 --> 10:16.160]  saudi arabian wahabi is funded al qaeda jihadis then you'll have the state department for 50 years
[10:16.160 --> 10:21.600]  funding you as the washington post reported a decade ago you'll have the state department
[10:21.600 --> 10:26.960]  currently funding it you'll have tens of billions of dollars the last four and a half years given
[10:26.960 --> 10:34.000]  to al qaeda to start it up again in western iraq to then invade syria with turkey's aid
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.800]  and nato's aid to kill 300 000 plus people and to be called heroes by cnn
[10:40.800 --> 10:50.800]  and the system thinks that the public is so incredibly irrevocably stupid
[10:56.320 --> 11:02.400]  that they're on the news today going oh my gosh either ice is connected
[11:02.400 --> 11:12.240]  they may have gotten the training in jordan or in yemen or in western iraq or in syria
[11:13.280 --> 11:19.440]  and we know there's connections to them back to isis and isle islamic state
[11:21.120 --> 11:26.240]  do you remember ted cruise saying last year we're not the air force for al qaeda do you
[11:26.240 --> 11:32.000]  remember rand paul's talking do you remember us and congressman walter jones and former congressman
[11:32.000 --> 11:41.600]  ron paul warning everyone and predicting not dozens not hundreds but 300 400 500 times that
[11:41.600 --> 11:51.120]  you would have mass shootings at schools churches synagogues newspapers and media facilities
[11:51.120 --> 11:58.400]  and now it's happening i don't even need to go dredge up all the articles and all the videos
[11:58.400 --> 12:01.280]  and all the special reports like i'm not even going to do it
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.520]  anyone who's a regular listener knows we've done it to an obnoxious level
[12:11.120 --> 12:16.800]  and now it's happening we knew three four years ago and ben gazi took place that they
[12:16.800 --> 12:22.320]  were being given stinger missiles by the thousands impads surface to air missiles
[12:24.720 --> 12:33.840]  heat seeking missiles wine of sight missiles you name it low tech high tech high energy weapons
[12:33.840 --> 12:40.720]  we've had the whistleblowers on from a cia by name we've had the special forces kernels on
[12:40.720 --> 12:49.760]  one we've given you all the sources in an hour and 45 minutes a mod salon in the third hour
[12:49.760 --> 12:57.040]  joins us in the new york times in 1993 the government having to admit that they basically
[12:57.040 --> 13:01.840]  cooked the bomb trained the drivers gave them the detonators and a mod salon tried to stop it
[13:01.840 --> 13:06.640]  as an fbi informant and blew the whistle john o'neill the deputy director of the fbi at the time
[13:06.640 --> 13:15.200]  went public over it and resigned one week before 9 11 saying they're going to allow al qaeda to
[13:15.200 --> 13:21.200]  blow up the world trade center and that was in the sunday telegraph of england he gave that
[13:21.200 --> 13:30.400]  speech in england we've got a mod salon coming on the broadcast in the third hour today i've had
[13:30.400 --> 13:39.120]  former justice department officials on the broadcast who when they had the 7 7 bombings went
[13:39.120 --> 13:47.360]  on air and said the leader of the 7 7 bombers is the mi6 and then three months later it came out
[13:47.360 --> 13:55.200]  in the british news that indeed the leader was mi6 and was being protected and led the attack
[13:55.200 --> 14:07.840]  radical islam is real and it's being brought in and nurtured and funded and protected and it's
[14:07.840 --> 14:17.040]  being prepared to be given full control of africa the middle east central asia and the far east
[14:17.040 --> 14:29.840]  islam you can debate it all day long is being taken over by a alliance of the big megacorporations
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.320]  the big oil companies in opac the big insurance companies and radical islam
[14:39.040 --> 14:45.440]  and anyone who wants progress like asad or buham arkadhafi and i'm not seeing either one of them
[14:45.440 --> 14:50.960]  as an angel but compared to al qaeda they are angels compared to al qaeda they are lions
[14:53.600 --> 14:56.160]  it's like saying a bank robbers an angel compared to
[14:58.800 --> 15:08.800]  jeffrey dommer or a german soldier on the eastern front in 1943 as an angel compared to adolf hitler
[15:08.800 --> 15:20.080]  the point is it's a fact it's being protected all along in fact
[15:22.400 --> 15:27.760]  here it is out of the new york times in 2012
[15:30.400 --> 15:33.440]  i have two articles i'm going to show to tv viewers i'm going to give you the name of
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.800]  these of your radio listener and they're in public archives of the new york times dot com
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.400]  bomb informers tapes give rare glimpse of fbi's dealings
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.440]  and it goes through the fact that the fbi basically created the bomb the detonators
[15:53.440 --> 15:57.120]  and let it go forward and they got recorded by the informant who was trying to stop it
[15:57.120 --> 16:06.000]  amad salam is joining us tapes to pick proposal to thwart bomb used in trade center blast
[16:06.880 --> 16:13.360]  new york times 1993 october 28th and they go into amad salam trying to stop
[16:14.240 --> 16:17.840]  the bombing 43 year old former egyptian army officer
[16:20.640 --> 16:25.600]  who tried to stop it was told to stand down this guy is a living smoking gun
[16:25.600 --> 16:33.680]  we're going to have him today and then here's a newer article 2012 terrorist plots hatched
[16:33.680 --> 16:38.240]  by the fbi the united states has been narrowly saved from lethal terrorist plots in recent years
[16:38.240 --> 16:42.080]  or so it has seemed a would-be suicide bomber was intercepted on the way to the capital a
[16:42.080 --> 16:46.640]  scheme to bomb synagogues and shoot stinger missiles at military aircraft was developed by
[16:46.640 --> 16:51.600]  men in new borough new york and the fans of a lot of fly explosive laden model planes in the
[16:51.600 --> 16:57.920]  pentagon and the capital was hatched in massachusetts but all these dramas were facilitated by the fbi
[16:57.920 --> 17:03.600]  whose undercover agents and informers posed as terrorists offering dummy missiles fake c4 explosives
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.800]  and disarmed suicide vests rudimentary training suspects naively played their parts until they
[17:08.800 --> 17:16.240]  were arrested in the case of 77 though you had patsy's that believe they were part of a drill
[17:16.240 --> 17:22.800]  which we confirmed when broke here because we had a source inside the bus company and then
[17:22.800 --> 17:28.240]  later it was admitted that there were drills of the exact same targets being hit at the exact
[17:28.240 --> 17:36.320]  same time that day the two trains and the bus ready to play the clips of bbc news where they
[17:36.320 --> 17:45.120]  have the head of scotland yard saying it's incredible then the head advisor consultancy
[17:45.120 --> 17:50.160]  been the head oh it's incredible we were running drills with the exact same targets being hit
[17:50.160 --> 18:00.080]  at the exact same time hiding it in plain view and they took school teachers secular guys that
[18:00.080 --> 18:08.080]  went to topless bars who thought they were getting some extra money to drill to fight radical islam
[18:08.080 --> 18:18.400]  and they were led by mi6 double agent al-qaeda so they could put out the messages that it was real
[18:18.400 --> 18:24.880]  but some of them figured it out and ran and were gunned down probably by mi6 at canary wharf and
[18:24.880 --> 18:28.560]  that was in the news that day i then flew days after to london
[18:28.560 --> 18:41.040]  and covered the event live on the ground i made the film terror storm a history of government
[18:41.040 --> 18:44.640]  sponsored terror we show the soviets doing it
[18:48.880 --> 18:56.240]  we show the entire nazi system doing it the zars before the soviets the u.s government doing it
[18:56.240 --> 19:08.960]  it's the oldest trick in the book so when we come back hiding in plain view
[19:11.120 --> 19:18.160]  terrorist probably real jihadis trained are running around
[19:18.160 --> 19:26.800]  killing 12 people in the newspaper three cops now two yesterday one today
[19:29.200 --> 19:32.800]  and they're going to use us to take more of our basic freedoms and they are announcing

[19:39.280 --> 19:44.480]  but even mainstream news is now pointing out that the orders are coming from islamic state
[19:44.480 --> 19:49.840]  again the group funded by the west protected given a safe haven and it's in the news
[19:53.120 --> 19:57.040]  that it looks like these guys may have gotten training with is as well

[24:24.720 --> 24:29.840]  the highways while the border stays wide open are you ready to see more political correctness
[24:29.840 --> 24:35.760]  forced on our throats teaching us that our speeches what caused the shootings in paris
[24:36.880 --> 24:42.240]  not the fact that it was western funded terror groups that were allowed to flourish that did it
[24:42.240 --> 24:50.640]  there's a arabia debate that is erupting i'm looking at businessweek.com drudge report.com
[24:50.640 --> 24:57.360]  has the image of the eiffel tower with the crescent moon above it a very powerful image
[24:58.880 --> 25:02.480]  and political correctness keeps us from discussing the fact that
[25:02.480 --> 25:13.440]  it how would folks feel say in egypt or saudi arabia if say 100 million germans even though
[25:13.440 --> 25:22.080]  there aren't 100 million germans there's about 65 million germans moved into their countries
[25:22.880 --> 25:28.000]  it's more than 100 million muslims that have migrated in the last 50 years to europe and the
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.960]  united states and other western countries and then they have high birth rates the west has
[25:32.960 --> 25:39.040]  been taught don't have children it's bad to be christian it's bad to be white it's bad to be a
[25:39.040 --> 25:44.640]  father it's bad to be manly it's bad if you make any of the decisions in your household the woman
[25:44.640 --> 25:49.200]  makes all the decisions but if you want to sexually mutilate women and chop their heads off it's trendy
[25:51.120 --> 25:56.000]  there's that sick alliance of political correctness and the ford foundation just like there is with
[25:56.000 --> 26:02.240]  mecha and la raza to break up the west and conquer us and then to put the muslims and
[26:02.240 --> 26:07.760]  everybody else in a different barrios in a different slums in different segregated areas
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.240]  and that's in the news today admitting that france has turned into a segregated area

[26:32.080 --> 26:36.640]  the bodies haven't been buried and the killers are on the loose but that didn't prevent anti islam
[26:36.640 --> 26:43.760]  politicians across europe from seizing on yesterday's massacre in paris oh they seized on it the
[26:43.760 --> 26:49.280]  rhetoric varied and intensely across the european union in 28 countries each with its own religious
[26:49.280 --> 26:56.240]  and social phobias oh it's a phobia not to want to be shot in the head many gripped by an economic
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.840]  recession that makes convenient scapegoats of immigrants especially those with veils turbines
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.520]  and non-white skin i wish my daughter will be free tomorrow to go around without a veil without any
[27:07.520 --> 27:16.560]  fears matito salvini head of italy's anti immigration northern league said well how dare him

[28:29.520 --> 28:38.000]  this big backlash against it in conservative movements that then just gets crystallized and
[28:38.000 --> 28:46.080]  transmuted into support for taking everybody's liberties and living in a police state when the
[28:46.080 --> 28:54.080]  whole police state on record is shut up for returning veterans godowners conservatives

[33:36.320 --> 33:41.840]  he cannot defend yesterday i made this point and here it is in the news today
[33:41.840 --> 33:50.480]  a the hip hop gangster culture that's pushed by mtv is so toxic so destructive
[33:51.840 --> 33:59.120]  so weaponized by different western intelligence agencies on record those are big claims you
[33:59.120 --> 34:08.400]  can just go look it up that it has become the dominant new culture with the arab gangs
[34:08.400 --> 34:15.360]  all over europe i've seen it with my own eyeballs but following the news daily i see it perpetually
[34:16.160 --> 34:23.760]  a few years ago london burning other cities burning paris burning with the young jihadi's out
[34:26.160 --> 34:30.560]  they're there to make their bones to show what superstars they are
[34:30.560 --> 34:38.640]  and now it comes out that the reported terrorist two of the shooters
[34:40.240 --> 34:44.960]  put out a rap video in fact we have some of that footage for tv viewers we'll roll some of that
[34:45.600 --> 34:49.360]  in the background and this is just your average narcissistic
[34:51.360 --> 34:59.200]  mentally ill type person who really wants to be somebody who gets attracted to the
[34:59.200 --> 35:07.680]  narcissist based uh gangster rap which is basically like a cult brainwashing chant
[35:10.320 --> 35:15.600]  where they have these very simplistic beats over and over again about how great you are
[35:15.600 --> 35:22.800]  you're a god you're the best you're unstoppable you're incredible and when you have a culturalist
[35:23.360 --> 35:27.840]  mindless population i don't care if you're arab i don't care if you're a white christian a black
[35:27.840 --> 35:34.480]  christian to me whoever you are an atheist this stuff is designed to target young people designed
[35:34.480 --> 35:42.640]  to make them think they're gods and then when it doesn't deliver hip hop uh stardom when you
[35:42.640 --> 35:49.840]  don't become a mac g when you're living in a trash can because you're cool when you're being inducted
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.560]  into the prison system you get mad and and what i've noticed and i've talked about this last year
[35:54.560 --> 36:04.480]  and this year ad nauseam is that it's a mixture of al qaeda meets hip hop meets gangster thugism
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.560]  gotta love al qaeda guys with their shorts hanging down over their butts like their punks in prison
[36:10.560 --> 36:17.040]  advertise in their tail that's what that means and notice that fads been around 30 years it never
[36:17.040 --> 36:22.400]  goes away because you're being inducted into prison you dress in a punk uniform so the police
[36:22.400 --> 36:27.280]  are alerted to you as an enemy so you can be inducted directly into prison and then be gang raped
[36:27.280 --> 36:31.360]  as soon as you get there because i'll assure you the people that are going to be raping you
[36:31.360 --> 36:39.120]  don't wear their drawers down hanging behind the booty but see it's what a sick joke the social
[36:39.120 --> 36:46.720]  engineers put out they got a big fat fake rick ross up there a former prison guard who figured
[36:46.720 --> 36:51.760]  out he who was a prison guard over a bunch of black slaves figuring out he could be a real slave
[36:51.760 --> 37:00.800]  master by inducting the brothers right into the assembly line of slavery and then he steals the
[37:00.800 --> 37:10.080]  identity of a real gangster rick ross by the way war suits and ties and throw brand new Mercedes
[37:10.080 --> 37:15.760]  bins and didn't have his drawers hanging down over his butt regardless of what you think about him
[37:15.760 --> 37:24.720]  because real gangsters don't have their drawers hanging down over their butt you idiots so in
[37:24.720 --> 37:31.440]  the final equation this is a giant cultural warfare system with a bunch of radical jihadis
[37:31.440 --> 37:36.880]  with no future feeling like second-class citizens in France where the French are all snobs to each
[37:36.880 --> 37:43.840]  other imagine being an Arab there you're invited in by the left to be a new socialist voting block
[37:43.840 --> 37:52.960]  because they pay you racial lip service and now you want to be big stars so you go out and you
[37:52.960 --> 38:02.560]  shoot 10 people in a newspaper because you go online and you watch the CIA slash interpol slash
[38:02.560 --> 38:09.600]  nato slash turkish slash israeli slash behind the whole thing Saudi Arabia and they tell you time
[38:09.600 --> 38:19.360]  to carry out jihad in France my brothers you're not going to be any body as a rapper love froggy
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.400]  and i love watching these young wannabe rappers white black hispanic
[38:27.680 --> 38:33.040]  era but doesn't matter with that same fake confidence yeah i'm going somewhere yeah i'm
[38:33.040 --> 38:41.360]  going to be somebody yeah all a fake synthetic weapon developed inside DARPA to ruin you and
[38:41.360 --> 38:53.520]  your family and it's done a great job kids there's a lot of catchy beats in that music and if you
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.520]  want to listen to it because you like the beats that's great but parents that just turn your kids
[38:57.520 --> 39:02.800]  over to it and believe me it's hard to keep my kids away from it because it's designed to catch
[39:02.800 --> 39:11.680]  young minds unsophisticated minds it's a mesmerizing mind control to then suck you into a culture to be
[39:11.680 --> 39:19.600]  a failure and if you like what rap and hip hop in its establishment version has done to the black
[39:19.600 --> 39:25.520]  community don't worry it's doing it to every community right now as you watch the world sink
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.920]  like we have a thousand pound rock around our neck and a hundred feet of water we're going to the
[39:31.920 --> 39:42.720]  bottom fast and so of course a bunch of slimy rap was involved in this that's up on info wars.com
[39:42.720 --> 39:48.320]  it's from the gateway pundit now before we go to your phone calls let's go ahead and go to ices video
[39:49.200 --> 39:55.200]  cbs news i mean i have cns news reporting on what callers talked about yesterday we had a marine
[39:55.200 --> 40:01.360]  call in and go don't you remember two years ago the free syrian army being trained in jordan by the
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.960]  marines and he listed the unit in fact pull that back up for me well folks looked into it and sure
[40:06.960 --> 40:13.520]  enough looks like the group that trained these boys was trained by the marine corps from the halls of
[40:13.520 --> 40:21.600]  montezuma to the shores of tripoli you know about the marines first major engagement after we were
[40:21.600 --> 40:27.280]  a country under thomas jefferson the president they were called leathernecks as they wore leather
[40:27.280 --> 40:34.400]  jackets with light armor that would protect their necks somewhat from glancing uh swords
[40:35.200 --> 40:42.480]  and they went out and wouldn't pay the bounty to the jihadis of that day in the Mediterranean but
[40:42.480 --> 40:49.520]  also in the persian gulf and off the coast of africa on its east coast and they went in there and
[40:49.520 --> 40:55.040]  well you know what the marines did killed everybody engaged the pirates who were openly
[40:55.040 --> 41:02.320]  backed by the chic of morocco and all the rest of the crew of course nowadays thomas jefferson if he
[41:02.320 --> 41:07.120]  was trendy would just say here's our daughters have them that's the thing you're supposed to do
[41:07.680 --> 41:15.040]  because thomas jefferson would be mackin the g's and homing down yeah all right because hollywood
[41:15.040 --> 41:21.600]  said it was cool fox news you know is even doing that and fox tv is betting everything they've got on
[41:21.600 --> 41:28.960]  promoting uh this type of garbage that's not even black culture it's just synthetic weaponized crap
[41:29.680 --> 41:36.480]  excuse me i'm ranting let's go ahead and go to the cbs report from where the terrorists come from
[41:36.480 --> 41:42.720]  where they get their orders oh the army funded by our degenerate criminal government here it is
[41:42.720 --> 41:51.440]  in a video released by isis just days ago a french jihadi in syria issued a chilling order
[41:54.880 --> 42:01.840]  blow up france and tear it down to pieces he said do it with a stone or a knife or whatever you
[42:01.840 --> 42:10.880]  can get your hands on so there you go ladies and gentlemen and i want to be clear there is a lot of
[42:10.880 --> 42:18.880]  hip-hop and rap that i think has good messages but you notice all those rappers whether it's
[42:18.880 --> 42:23.440]  professor griff or carers one or the real rick ross or all these people will sit there and speak
[42:23.440 --> 42:29.600]  out against it saying it's government run to wreck communities that that's a fact and i've talked to
[42:29.600 --> 42:37.600]  not one not two but more than two top executives that were in record companies are in record companies
[42:37.600 --> 42:46.480]  at mtv major rock stars you name it that were in the room in the early 90s when they said rock and
[42:46.480 --> 42:52.640]  rolls out the cia doesn't think it's destabilizing things enough because they tried to hijack that
[42:52.640 --> 42:58.880]  that's been declassified it's like they had ugly art put out to confuse people that was declassified
[42:58.880 --> 43:04.240]  last year we already knew that they said we're going to put out the most sickening gangster
[43:04.240 --> 43:12.320]  rap you can imagine it's going to be king and it was force fed by some new redstone and viacom
[43:13.440 --> 43:19.280]  the tip of the spear so that's why i attack it because it is the weapon system just like rick
[43:19.280 --> 43:24.640]  ross talked about a few months ago when he was here in studio the real rick ross who's going
[43:24.640 --> 43:29.440]  to be back in town coming up in a few weeks the fake rick ross did respond and i never talked
[43:29.440 --> 43:36.160]  about this a month ago in a video and said that uh you know what i'm not responding when he was
[43:36.160 --> 43:43.520]  asked on tv show i'm not responding to the that rick ross why that guy was a snitch in prison
[43:44.160 --> 43:49.120]  well number one the real rick ross was not a snitch in prison had to stay in there 25 years
[43:50.320 --> 43:54.240]  number two he's been speaking out from prison against the drug war and apologizing
[43:54.240 --> 44:01.600]  and then talking about the cia and drug dealing but number three it was the fake rick ross that was
[44:01.600 --> 44:09.760]  a big fat jail guard at a federal prison over black people mainly it turns out who went and
[44:09.760 --> 44:18.480]  created this fake persona and then says he's this big drug dealer mac g roller and then steal somebody's
[44:18.480 --> 44:26.480]  identity and then has the nerve to then sit there and claim that person's a snitch when the fake
[44:26.480 --> 44:34.560]  rick ross is the judas goat you know what a judas goat is it's the ram the billy goat
[44:34.560 --> 44:40.480]  that leads the other billy goats or in the case the male sheep if it's sheep you're talking about
[44:41.040 --> 44:47.280]  not goats that leads them into the slaughterhouse and he goes out the other end safe and rick ross
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.440]  is the worst of the worst he's a george soros in my book selling out his own people
[44:57.520 --> 45:01.440]  but it doesn't matter people that are insecure have nothing had their culture destroyed
[45:02.080 --> 45:08.560]  that's all of us basically that's what they don't like us all to be see fake confidence is everything
[45:08.560 --> 45:17.200]  you'll see beautiful beautiful women with the biggest loser with no money no looks no success
[45:17.200 --> 45:28.080]  but they know how to act confident around women and the women if they're stupid and the average
[45:28.080 --> 45:34.800]  person stupid america now uninformed buy into it because they just keep believing it's gotta
[45:34.800 --> 45:43.920]  deliver as long as the person acts confident versus being confident a really confident person
[45:43.920 --> 45:49.440]  is not overconfident and pushy with people that aren't in their face a real confident person
[45:49.440 --> 45:54.880]  wants to build other people up wants to build a better world and only pulls the knife out when
[45:54.880 --> 46:02.400]  you need to and then you use it well i talk about a knife i mean that figuratively the average
[46:02.400 --> 46:12.400]  college freshman now reads at a seventh grade level that's from campus reform that's a mission

[56:00.480 --> 56:07.840]  checked dan thank you for calling today thank you alex um i live in kansas city missouri i'm actually
[56:07.840 --> 56:14.320]  from a small town in illinois and um when i came to kansas city i had culture shock i mean
[56:15.360 --> 56:21.760]  everybody's in long black garbs with covers upon their heads and i'm not a i'm not prejudiced
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.880]  everybody has their own beliefs no i know but if we were in you know egypt and suddenly there were uh
[56:26.880 --> 56:32.240]  you know uh girls in many skirts everywhere they would freak out there's a culture shock and we're
[56:32.240 --> 56:36.720]  not supposed to have that shock we're supposed to give up our culture spit on it and worship any
[56:36.720 --> 56:42.240]  other culture get with the program and abort a baby today go ahead sorry yeah you're right you're
[56:42.240 --> 56:48.400]  right alexa the thing is this this world is ruled by the devil himself and the people that do the
[56:48.400 --> 56:54.000]  acts that they do are controlled by him i'm really compelled to say this that we should pray for our
[56:54.000 --> 57:00.640]  leaders and and pray for all of them that they wake up but on the other side you're right we must
[57:00.640 --> 57:07.520]  resist this kind of behavior and get the word out there and i agree with you but instead of me
[57:07.520 --> 57:11.760]  interrupting you and changing the flow go back to what you're seeing because for those that don't know
[57:11.760 --> 57:16.880]  the borders are completely wide open to basically anybody from a third world country that wants to
[57:16.880 --> 57:23.040]  come here and they're flooding uh the midwest you name it uh with folks from the middle east
[57:23.040 --> 57:27.920]  what are you saying well see i'm i'm actually mexican and german so i kind of grew up in both
[57:27.920 --> 57:34.640]  heritage i'm born and raised in in wisconsin in milwaukee um what i'm what well i actually went to
[57:34.640 --> 57:40.240]  hispanic church for i've been i've been in a few of them but i found that i had to leave the hispanic
[57:40.240 --> 57:47.360]  church because nobody spoke english really so yeah yeah so for months my brain was just dead
[57:47.360 --> 57:52.400]  and nobody would try to try to converse with everybody was coming from Honduras and other
[57:52.400 --> 57:58.480]  places and uh beautiful people but the the calls and the things that they they're taught about you
[57:59.120 --> 58:06.320]  is that you're a bad guy and they're in church okay so uh it's um you know we're living in a
[58:06.320 --> 58:13.040]  blinded world but are you sure who are they being taught as bad you are oh of course one brother
[58:13.040 --> 58:17.680]  from church and i was saying you know give your oh yeah he doesn't know you get a few people he
[58:17.680 --> 58:23.280]  doesn't know what he's talking about and it's just they just don't understand some people will see
[58:23.280 --> 58:27.680]  some people won't see well brother just keeps spreading the word they'll understand the bigger
[58:27.680 --> 58:32.720]  picture that's what this is all about it's just they don't want to bring us all together in a
[58:32.720 --> 58:37.120]  melting pot they want to get us all together killing each other while the globalists rule over us

[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:27.280]  it looked like they were using 7.6239 uh or war saw uh ammo that's used in the collision to cough
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.120]  yeah there's actually a photo of a shell casing on the ground next to a police bicycle that got hit
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:39.280]  by a car the bicycle kind of crumbled and there's a like a chalked out circle around a shell casing
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:44.880]  on the ground um i can't get a big enough resolution picture of it i'm sure yeah i don't have that photo
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.920]  in front of me but you know it might be a police officer's casing as well does it look like a rifle
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:02:00.720]  casing i can't tell it doesn't look like a 7.62 uh rifle casing well you know the police were in
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:07.760]  a shootout with them so uh if it's not what the i believe the french police basically use something
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:15.840]  like a nine millimeter but i'd have to check um are you bringing the substances a point of investigation
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:21.920]  yeah well you know otherwise i'm just calling you know i i used to live in paris and now i
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:27.680]  live in beijing china and uh i was just talking to some of my my chinese and and french friends
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:35.280]  about this and i seem to have the outlier opinion here and um i have been called like a conspiracy
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.480]  theorist uh because i keep telling everybody you have to look at operation gladio before you you

[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:14.240]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.960]  the french government has decided to temporarily close their embassies and schools in several
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:40.480]  muslim countries after satirical weekly shawty ebdo published cartoons mocking the prophet
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.840]  muhammad is the white house concerned that those cartoons might further find the flames in the
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.840]  region well we are aware that a french magazine published cartoons bringing a figure resembling
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.080]  the prophet muhammad and obviously we have questions about the judgment of publishing
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.440]  something like this we know that these images will be images will be deeply offensive to many
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.240]  and have the potential to be inflammatory but we've spoken repeatedly about the importance
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.320]  of upholding the freedom of expression that is enshrined in our constitution in other words
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:17.600]  we don't question the right of something like this to be published we just question the judgment
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.040]  behind the decision to publish it and and i think that that's our view about the video that
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:31.840]  was produced in this country and and has caused so much offense in the muslim world world now
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.000]  it has to be said and i'll say it again that no matter how offensive
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.160]  something like this is it is not in any way justification for violence
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.880]  not in any way all right justification for violence that's carney back in 2012 when they
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:57.440]  were trying to blame unrest all over the world not on food prices going up that's the main
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:03.600]  indicator most sociologists believe it's well known in countries where you spend half your money or
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:10.480]  more a discretionary income on food when food prices go up unrest goes up that's what caused
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:15.840]  the destabilization the arab spring that we've seen the last five years you go back three years
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:24.800]  ago to 2012 it was just an excuse oh there's a magazine in paris oh somebody made a video making
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:32.240]  fun of the prophet muhammad let's go burn down and blow up some churches it's an excuse to carry
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:40.240]  out violence and the white house was basically condemning the cartoon then now obama as you know
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.520]  has come out and basically defended the publication condemned the parachutings carries talked about
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.600]  how they had courage so of all the other major talking heads that had been there criticizing
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:11:00.720]  free speech now if you go to info wars dot com here's some of the headlines paris shooting
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:07.040]  official story keeps changing by the second very important rundown and that video report by jacari
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:12.880]  jackson uh 15 cartoons from artist responding to paris shooting you've got to go look at these
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:20.640]  on president planet dot com and info wars dot com uh the first one shows uh a person in a t-shirt
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:29.680]  with the name charlie ebdo on it with the head cut off but rising like the phoenix a big tongue
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:36.320]  is sticking out of the neck uh where the head's been chopped off uh basically saying that the phoenix
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:44.400]  will rise again my favorite one is the image of three pencils three red pencils one on top says
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:53.280]  yesterday it's an unbroken pencil today a broken pencil tomorrow they sharpen the other end the
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:59.840]  broken part and so now you have two pencils actually you could sharpen the other broken side
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:07.440]  and have three pencils but it shows how you attack free press you attack liberty generally in almost
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:13.600]  every case it produces more resistance that's why they haven't killed me that's why they haven't
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.520]  completely set me up though they've tried a few times because they understand that it will only
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:26.000]  cause more people to focus on what i've covered here on air that's the power of the first amendment
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.120]  that's why the pin is mightier than the sword there's a bunch of other powerful
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:41.120]  cartoons as well defending free speech worldwide not just the first amendment here in this constitutional
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.240]  republic and regardless of what's behind this whether it's a false flag or not and i don't know
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.760]  whether it's totally staged they killed a couple pat season some unnamed group did this
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.920]  to get more defense contract spending or to invade yemen or whatever the case may be the west did
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.560]  fund isis known as al-qaeda for four and a half years they did give them the training in the weapons
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:13.920]  isis did call days before this attack for attacks in paris and so that's a false flag even if it was
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:24.720]  real the mother ship that launched this attack was built by the globalist on record and as i
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.920]  predicted shooting attacks in europe shooting attacks in the us airliners to be shot down now
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.960]  they're saying get ready for that to happen you can see the scripted only because the system
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:42.640]  thinks we're so stupid and won't remember that our own power structure helped reconstitute al-qaeda
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.760]  and when the military got upset two years ago and refused to invade syria with ground troops and
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:54.160]  air bombardment and and the military went public and said this is al-qaeda they changed the name
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:03.120]  to confuse the public and the military it has not worked so the good news is the military does
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.280]  know the players they do understand what's going on they are not compartmentalized they are not stupid
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:17.360]  and they're hopping mad let's go ahead and race through your phone calls uh matthew and then tom
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:25.200]  phyllis erin jone when you hear me hang up on somebody that's your chance to call in 800-2599-231
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.440]  and just give me your point i'm going to move the next person i want to go to a lot of people
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:35.200]  matthew in new jersey you're on the air thanks for calling hey alex thanks for taking my call
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.280]  first time caller my what i'm calling reference to is actually quite a few things you just touched
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:47.040]  on with the um old you know pointing through false flags you're saying i'm sure not yet
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:53.120]  um but the first the second call i think it was a victor you mentioned the uh the 762 millimeter
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.320]  now the whole thing i keep looking about at that video when i saw it and i saw it this morning too
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:04.240]  on youtube at jacari jackson where he's showing the reels going through you can see that the gunman
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.400]  as he went by it really really appears clearly that he lifted the rifle really quickly and shot
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.680]  the ground and you can see the ground hitting with the smoke coming up now to reference like a head
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.320]  shot i would have to say look at john f kennedy his own wife turned around sort of picking up his
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.040]  brains and his skull fragments as he was still rocking around we don't see that with this head
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:32.320]  shot shooting no i hear you but it depends where a bullet goes in i mean i've shot wild hogs deer
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:38.480]  elk you name it in the head and sometimes it goes clean through and it runs 100 yards other times
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.680]  it blows the whole side of the head off i mean i shot a hog one time and about 60 percent of its
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.680]  head blew off the entire side and part of the front all blew out no blood almost no blood
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:55.120]  everything just emptied out like unzipped its head i've shot a wild hog before and the bullet
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.680]  goes right through it and i use a hog example because they've got bigger skulls like humans
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:05.680]  uh it looks like he fires a couple times one time hits the ground the other hits him in the head but
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:12.000]  i mean look the government's been caught staging stuff so i don't blame people for questioning
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:19.040]  this and saying it may be fake i just don't see the evidence yet the minute we see it if it comes
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:27.040]  out we will go there but but again it's provocateur and that they set up isis to begin with and then
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:33.920]  turn them loose doesn't mean western governments run them completely it's the analogy of dumping
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:41.600]  100 black widows in your neighbor's bed you didn't order the black widows to bite them
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.280]  there's a good chance that the black widows are going to hide under the bed and some of them are
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.960]  going to come out in the night and you're going to roll over on one and it's going to bite you
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.720]  so they turn loose enough black widows you're going to have a problem anything else matthew
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:00.400]  well this the last reference we just said there i totally agree with you too and it's just how
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.280]  did this came out to you it's uh just early this month as was coming out coming out of iraqi
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.920]  iraqi officials who are claiming you know us you're still dropping supplies isis you're still
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:15.840]  that's in mainstream news that the iraqi president and others are saying oh you did another
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:22.960]  airdrops to al qaeda by accident right to isis i mean it's ridiculous thanks for calling
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.360]  yeah because our own military is getting mad about giving weapons to al qaeda they now tell
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:33.280]  them drop weapons in this grid and then it's turning out it's isis and al qaeda i mean it's
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:41.040]  sick folks it's sick then al qaeda attacks us then the government gets to grandstand and take our
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:45.920]  freedom it's a very simple equation tom in new mexico thanks for calling welcome
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:52.720]  alice this is uh let me just make a comment on the ballistics this is not what i call for i
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.560]  have some very other interesting anomalies uh i'd like to put from sure go ahead just as far
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:05.280]  just as far as the ballistics uh if you listen to the soundtrack there are three shots five shots
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:12.240]  from an obviously different caliber and then the coup d'etre and uh it's really hard to see but i'm
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:19.680]  they both look like a case however uh there are two different kinds of a case one's an ak-47 which
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:29.040]  shoots the uh seven six seven six uh nine by 40 by 39 and the soviets also have a smaller one
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:37.920]  comparable to the m4 it's even lighter than an m4 it's a five four five by 39 it's a hot little
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.880]  round but it's because i i was taken by the fact that when he made the shot there was absolutely
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:48.560]  no recoil i said oh there's something wrong there but if you uh if you're very fired uh
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:56.480]  make a 47 you can get a little bit of kick but you know in my experience it has a low kick if you
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.920]  just hold the gun hard i mean sure a lot of folks hold a gun light so there's going to be recoil
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.800]  if you just hold a gun hard and that's not a technical term but that's how i hold a gun
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:13.360]  but i don't know i mean i hand fire 50 calibers and don't think there's any kick compared to most
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.080]  guns but i hear what you're saying i mean what's your gut tell you about this whole thing i mean
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.280]  looking at it it looks like it's a couple wannabe jihadis trying to be famous who'd gotten some
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:34.560]  training but the system lies so much who knows what i called in for um the the ak-74 at five feet
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.800]  is going to punch a very tiny little hole and i agree with you there doesn't need to be a large pool
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:46.160]  of blood i i debt that i just want to make a comment this is what i call well stay there

[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:35.920]  in the third hour today he was the fbi informant the egyptian cia asset who exposed the false
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:42.160]  flag tried to stop it and was successful in recording and proving that the fbi basically
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:48.960]  allowed it to go forward he was able to tape them ordering him to basically let it go forward
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:53.760]  he knew it was a setup and tried to stop it and exposed it he will be joining us today he wrote
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:59.440]  the book undercover we'll go back over those new york times articles and more to understand how
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.600]  when i say something's an inside job in most cases it doesn't mean barack obama is sitting there
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:11.840]  like wiley coyote with the detonator plunger pushing down blowing something up it means they
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:19.360]  just wind up crazies open the door and allow them to attack but in some cases they like to have
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.880]  deniability they'll use private criminal murk groups who will then kill a patsy and frame them
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.240]  so there's layer after layer to separate it you want to understand how this works there's a lot
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:36.160]  of historical examples i've made films covering it but a great fiction movie is mark wallbergs
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:42.560]  which he was involved in making really respect them as a director the shooter you want to see
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:47.600]  how they do a false flag that it's incredibly accurate and what governments really run by
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:54.800]  these combine groups within government watch that movie i own no stock in it i gotta watch that movie
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.360]  again i got shook up i didn't see that in the theater i saw it the year after it came out on
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:05.360]  the treadmill watched it on dvd years ago and it's just so accurate i mean that is exactly
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:11.200]  the stuff they pull you want to know how it's done that's it so it's not corporations it's not
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:18.400]  government it's not it's networks within at key points that'll hire a murk group who'll then go
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:24.720]  out and recruit the patsies who are the idiots and then i mean if this is a false flag that's
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.760]  probably what it is and these guys were dead a long time ago but we'll never know that's the
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.800]  problem it's kind of like all the callers calling in obsessing after one caller called in about
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:43.040]  were those ak 7.6239 or i don't see a recoil and it's who knows folks we'll never know
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:50.000]  i know our government and others helped set up the jihadis that are now running wild
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.440]  in the middle east that's the big enchilada that's what's admitted we forced that out in the open
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:01.360]  so no matter where it comes from our governments are illegitimate and stand to gain from it
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.840]  at the expense of our liberty i'm sick of it excuse me i'm ranting tom in new mexico finish up sorry
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.280]  yeah i i didn't mean to be rude it's just i've been doing this for long no no you're not rude
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.880]  i was about to call her bringing something up and how it becomes a chain reaction obsessing over the
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.760]  caliber of the gun while the elephant in the room is our government openly created al qaeda go ahead
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.480]  well well i've been doing this a long time and and you you first have to establish what happened
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:34.960]  before you try to figure out who and why and uh i'm going to present you some facts and you can
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:41.520]  do it okay enough preface brother we're running out of time go ahead okay okay okay the uh the uh

[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:42.640]  interesting when you look at that address and get down the street view there are two uh uh uh
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:47.440]  police snushing now sitting out there obviously just hanging out which i thought was kind of

[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  making a speech there doesn't seem to be much you know a protocol you know to keep everybody
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  safe or quote safe you know like uh how they ran over everybody in boston and kept them in the homes
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.640]  you know going around putting everybody yeah that's the feds doing that giving the orders to
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.440]  militarize and roll out the police and lock down half the city and drag women out of their homes
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:25.200]  that look nothing like the suspects uh as just a raw exercise of power and then it didn't even
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:31.840]  catch the other patsy and the boston bombing was a patsy operation that's why he's pled not guilty
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.880]  and why they've had the fbi out executing witnesses in their homes that's a great point good to hear
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:42.000]  from you erin phyllis in georgia what i'm getting from the listeners is they don't buy the official
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:49.040]  story they think it's a false flag i cannot blame the listeners thinking that because so many false
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:58.160]  flags have been revealed the problem is isis itself is the big kahuna false flag you shut up
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:05.840]  200 000 they now admit that 200 000 western funded fighters a bunch of westerners go and join it
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:11.360]  it's given weapons by the west it's going to leak out and start attacking western countries
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:18.400]  it's clear they funded the same group to attack libya they took over there they held up signs saying
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:24.800]  demascus syria is next then they said bagdad is next the signs they're holding up now say
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:32.160]  paris and london and new yorker next and they've got idiot camp followers that watch listen i'm
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:38.560]  online i know real stuff when i see it there are real teenagers and young people that are ne'er
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:45.200]  due wells and aimless and have no future and want to be rock stars and the way to be a rock star
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:54.080]  it's being advertised is join a jihad it's a shaken bank they are trying to hype up in the culture
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:02.640]  young people using their access to the second amendment to cause a jihad in this country
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.520]  which will then be used to restrict the second amendment the good news is most american muslim
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:14.320]  youth are not biting because the tactics are known or out there so they go to plan b they try to get
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:22.400]  young muslims to be involved in drills then they set them up in the drill kill them have the real
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:28.400]  operation carried out and then blame it on a corpse and they'll do this with cops they'll do it with
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:33.280]  veterans let me explain something when they're done setting up the police state for muslims
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.240]  they're going to move on to veterans patriots that's always been the plan now that plan is revealed
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.240]  that's why this is so important we cannot allow the persecution of muslims because it's wrong
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:51.280]  to persecute people a b when they're done with them baby you better believe the patriots the
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:58.720]  number one enemy of the new world order they're coming for us and if they ever set me up and claim
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:04.880]  i want violence you know it's bull if i ever supposedly commit suicide they killed me
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:12.960]  i'm gonna be taken out of this world kicking and screaming i will have Darth Vader level
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:18.240]  procedures done to stay alive you understand i'm not gonna kill myself and i'm not gonna
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:25.440]  offensively go hurt anybody hypothetically i'll think this would happen but if some crazy cop
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.360]  and they've got state law saying i'm gonna defend myself pulled me over with my family got out and
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:34.800]  said i'm gonna kill you i would defend myself that's not gonna happen one chance out of a billion
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:43.520]  but that's it i'm not offensively doing jack squat just like lexington and concord they didn't
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:49.440]  pull the trigger first but the redcoats marched up and said turn your guns in and the and the captain
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.760]  it was the preacher he said uh forget his name we can look up his famous words recorded by the
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:59.040]  british as well he said men we're not looking for trouble we don't want a war do not shoot first
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.800]  as they were marching up screaming at him but if they aim to have a war it's going to start right
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:10.000]  here they pull the trigger it starts right here and that's where i'm at arm yourself get ready
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:17.840]  to defend yourself prepare but 90 of your energy should be trying to save things peacefully wake
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:27.040]  people up 90 of our energy should be on waking up the police the military waking up the legislatures
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.840]  waking up the judges waking up the media waking up people in government let me tell you something
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:39.120]  i can criticize the cia and the fbi all day but there's a paradox there i can criticize federal
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:44.000]  marshals and secret service and cops all day until you get out there in the real world let me give
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:52.400]  a little newsflash because i've experienced it in 20 years on air do you i was so naive
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.800]  that when the fbi would give me restricted documents and things back in the late 90s i
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:05.120]  thought it was a setup and that it wasn't real until years later it was declassified and i was
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:12.960]  given real documents by good people that's how naive i was i just thought all bad all bad all bad
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:19.520]  that's not how it works ladies and gentlemen even if somebody isn't bad i knew the system is bad so
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:24.960]  i counted them as bad that's how they want us to think the people in the government are more
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:32.400]  awake than we are who do you think william benney is one of the top code breakers in history on record
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:38.080]  the head of a major nsa division number four in the nsa he went public
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.680]  you need to understand compared to the public people in the government are more awake than the
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:51.280]  public it's easy to hate the government all day i'm not anti-government i'm anti tyranny in government
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.480]  and believe me people in government are the ones under a thumb they're the ones being persecuted
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.560]  they're the ones being surveilled and pushed around to not expose the tyranny they're the
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:06.080]  ones being witch hunted they're the ones ready to work with us to restore the republic that's
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:11.120]  why the globalists want to start a civil war with terror attacks to get a shooting war going
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:18.560]  before we peak fix things peacefully you understand that that's why they're busy trying to get
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:24.320]  malicious to blow stuff up all over the country criminal elements of the fbi batf and others but
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:31.920]  it's not working because you know what happens it gets leaked whenever the fbi is trying to do that
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:41.040]  or the batf and do you know who's leaking it the batf and the fbi we have achieved victory level
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:47.440]  saturation of the truth in the system you may have some go along get along people in these
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:53.360]  agencies but they most of them don't want to overtly overthrow the country and sell out their
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:42:01.040]  own children they now know what the new order means so that's why i go off on this jag about
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:07.600]  not being offensively violent that is exactly what the system wants but yeah they're marching down
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:13.440]  the street with the military doing gun confiscation of general public it's gonna start and i'm not
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:19.360]  looking for it i'm not asking for it but if there's gonna be a war you'll start there on that day
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.960]  and then i will be very sad because it'll be the police the military that take the brunt of this
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:31.040]  civil war that will look like the most violent civil war of history times two
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.000]  because people like george soros will sit it out in switzerland laughing at the dumb yanks
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.600]  and that's what he calls americans yanks a known nazi collaborator
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:51.120]  that has his agents crawling all over my operation right now
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.160]  think i've talked about this many times it really sticks in my craw
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:05.760]  that both my grandfather served this country in world war two and both almost died in the army
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:13.120]  air corps and they'd been dead a long time one of them 11 years one of them more than 20 years
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:20.160]  they were great good hard-working men and a nazi collaborator basically runs this country
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.080]  and gets awards from the adl and has his organizations all over the place trying to make
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.840]  stuff up and digging into what i'm up to and sending their people in and trying to mess with our
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:39.440]  operation he's just it's not right it's not right but this country so overrun with scum
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:49.200]  they're a bunch of filth i'm sick of it and i don't want to see a race war start i don't
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:53.200]  want to see a war on the police start because it's coming out of the new world order and it's meant
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.400]  to burn this country down but you know this country is so immoral on average is so evil
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:03.040]  i don't know if we have any hope sometimes but then there's so many good people as well it's a
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:08.400]  paradox and i've now gone off on a jag i'm gonna skip this network break but i gotta
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.760]  quit skipping immortal bankrupt the show i skipped so many now it's not even really a radio show
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.280]  folks it's just an emergency beacon where i'm here just trying to shake people out of their
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:28.720]  doldrums out of their trance this is so real and i'll come back to phyllis jone jeff geno v is that
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:36.560]  right geno vani a bunch of other people this is something we can do something about we can do
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.000]  something about gmo we can do something about vaccines we can do something about high fructose
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.360]  corn syrup we can do something about their attacks at least at that level we can take control of so
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:51.920]  much in our own daily lives let's go ahead and go to this special report from last night's nightly
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:58.080]  news with anthony gucciardi and others it's a very important report we've tweeted it out at
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:04.320]  real alex jones we posted it on facebook in fact we'll put it up on screen and i'll give you the uh
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:17.760]  the title of it poison makeover poison makeover and you can go to our facebook into our twitter
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:23.760]  and you can get the report it's named high fructose the secret killer of the masses
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.680]  and i think that's an important headline but it probably needs to be consumer alert high
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.720]  fructose corn syrup name changed and this is really a consumer alert here because we're winning
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:41.120]  this war so the enemy's pulling a fast one let's go to this report for years mega food manufacturers
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:46.080]  have told us to not look at the label or the ingredients of your product and that high fructose
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.960]  corn syrup is perfectly safe it's the same as sugar you shouldn't even care in fact if you're
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:57.200]  eating regular sugar from fruit then high fructose corn syrup is the same thing but unfortunately for
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:02.800]  them and fortunately for humanity due to some recent studies i'm about to reveal to you we have
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:06.720]  been looking and we have been concerned because we don't want to eat garbage and we don't want to
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:12.480]  feed our family mercury laden high fructose corn syrup and yes it does contain mercury as the
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:19.680]  washington post has shown specifically now the corporations have lost the battle to such a degree
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:26.000]  that they're giving up and renaming high fructose corn syrup so no longer are you even allowed to
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.080]  know just like gmo's from monsanto and other biotech industries if you're eating high fructose
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:37.760]  corn syrup they've gone now and according to the corn growers association they have literally
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:43.600]  changed high fructose corn syrup just to fructose and how do they possibly get away with that they
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:49.920]  just say well it's the same thing there's nothing wrong with that and this is actually a quote from
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:56.960]  the corn growers association they say that the term fructose is now being used to denote a product
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:03.920]  that was previously known as high fructose corn syrup 90 meaning it's 90 pure fructose compare
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:09.360]  this to what is now termed the regular high fructose corn syrup which contains either 42 or 55
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:14.480]  percent fructose and you'll easily know why general mills and others are so eager to keep you in the
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:19.840]  dark now specifically what we're saying here is that they're changing high fructose corn syrup
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:26.560]  to a less scary name just regular fructose sugar it's totally safe the washington post however
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:32.960]  and other mainstream news outlets disagree let's look specifically here when it was found that
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:38.000]  high fructose corn syrup not only is it unhealthy and there's a new study explaining exactly why
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.240]  and how it's actually killing you and harming your reproduction and shortening your life
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:48.240]  but specifically how it's contaminated with one of the most toxic if not the most toxic substances
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:54.400]  in the known world specifically here we can look at the washington post article from 2009 where it
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.000]  says almost half of tested samples of commercial high fructose corn syrup contained mercury which
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.080]  was also found in nearly a third of 55 popular brand name food and beverage products where high
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:11.440]  fructose corn syrup is the first or second highest labeled ingredient this is according to two new
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:16.880]  studies now specifically they went to the store shelves this wasn't some scam system this was
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.520]  an independent actual analysis and that's why we see real results we don't see these things when
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.240]  monsanto or major food corporations fund these studies to say that it's perfectly safe and
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:30.880]  you've seen the commercials on television on youtube when the ads play before the video
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.880]  where they're feeding their families the ice cream and the cookies and it says high fructose
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:40.640]  corn syrup is so safe it's the same as sugar well as it turns out they all actually contain
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:45.440]  these major brand names about a third of them and they only tested about 55 you can imagine about
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:50.080]  90 percent of them i would say actually contained some form of contamination maybe not mercury
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:56.080]  but they all contained mercury in levels that were actually harmful specifically here is a quote
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:01.760]  from one of the lead professors mercury is toxic in all its forms given how much high fructose
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.480]  corn syrup is consumed by children it could be a significant additional source of mercury
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.200]  never before considered we are calling for immediate changes by industry and the fda to
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:17.200]  help stop this avoidable mercury contamination of the food supply so specifically now children
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.280]  are munching down on this garbage which is bad for them anyway and contains high fructose
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:26.160]  corn syrup which is shortening their lives but they're also getting a major intake of mercury
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.800]  and they've never factored this in before and then they're saying well gee what's going on why are
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:35.920]  all these kids getting cancer why are all these kids having signs of you know heavy metal overload
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.800]  and mercury overload why are all these kids getting other sources that we are intaking and
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:45.760]  not counting all of the high fructose corn syrup and watching them have you know childhood diseases
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.320]  that we've never had in the past 50 years well it's pretty simple and a new study just came out
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:56.000]  actually while I was looking into all this I found from the University of Utah and this is a major
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.040]  groundbreaking study has been on the front page of many news outlets however it's interesting to
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:04.720]  see when the mainstream media won't actually talk about it because they're of course sponsored in
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.840]  many cases by the food manufacturers who have an ad right next to the article proclaiming how safe
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.560]  high fructose corn syrup is and how great their sugary sodas are so let's look at this article
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:21.120]  specifically fructose more toxic than table sugar in mice there it is plainly stated from the
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.880]  university out of Utah when University of Utah biologists fed mice sugar and doses proportional
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:32.240]  to what many people eat the fructose glucose mixture found in high fructose corn syrup was
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:39.440]  more toxic than sucrose or table sugar reducing both the reproduction and lifespan of female
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:45.600]  rodents there it is and they don't even mention that it contains mercury is it the mercury doing
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.320]  this is it the other contamination is it the genetically modified ingredients that go into
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:55.200]  the corn that makes high fructose corn syrup because remember a large portion of the corn
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:00.400]  supply in addition to soy and other crops are genetically modified so are we being hit by the
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:06.000]  mercury the GMOs or the very constituents that make up high fructose corn syrup let's continue
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.280]  reading this is the most robust study showing there is a difference between high fructose corn
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:17.520]  syrup and table sugar at human relevant doses coming from a biology professor Wayne Potts who
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:23.520]  is a senior author of the study now we've known this for quite some time and Princeton also said
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.800]  this back I believe in 2010 and they were ostracized from the medical community saying
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:33.040]  high fructose corn syrup is perfectly safe and that's what those campaigns came from because
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:36.800]  everyone hates high fructose corn syrup and you talk to anyone that cuts out of their diet they're
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.200]  instantly losing weight feeling better overall getting up in the morning and actually thinking
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:45.680]  what's happening oh wait I'm not dosing myself with GMOs mercury and other constituents that
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:50.800]  make up high fructose corn syrup the bottom line however is that we are achieving victory because
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:56.000]  in reality these corporations are being forced to run away from the truth they're being forced to
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.200]  run away from the reality that they're pumping garbage into their products they know that you
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:05.760]  know and you're not going to buy it anymore that's why they're rebranding it it's actually should be
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.800]  held as a victory these studies coming out is public information and public knowledge growing
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:16.000]  and the corporations they're running behind their darkness their shield and their cape of darkness
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.840]  running away from you because you're actually making a difference you are the activists when you
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:24.800]  don't buy this garbage so overall I would say this is a victory I would say spread the word
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:30.960]  share the information when this is up on info wars.com tomorrow in the very early morning
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:35.840]  and afternoon share this information because if you are unknowingly eating high fructose corn
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:40.560]  syrup or your friends and family or your kids are eating high fructose corn syrup under this new
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:46.400]  name fructose and you can share these articles as well to let people know then they have no idea
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.880]  that they're getting mercury GMOs and other garbage in their body on a daily basis that is making
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:55.840]  them sick fat and giving them cancer. I'm Anthony Gutiarty and it's essential to protect your health
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:01.200]  and it's great that we're defunding these worthless corporations that are just plugging us full of
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:07.200]  total garbage. I tell you what a team we've got with Darren McBreen and Anthony Gutiarty and
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:16.800]  Adon Salazar and Nico Acosta and Rob Dew and John Bown and Jakari Jackson and Leanne McAdoo and
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:20.800]  I just can't and David Knight the list just goes on and I'm leaving people out of there
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:27.440]  Marcos Morales, Josh Owens, Rob Jacobson, all the support crew everybody just everybody.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.440]  I need to have like a big group broadcast sometime in the big studio with all the crew
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:36.320]  that makes the info or possible but Gutiarty did that teleprompter free
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:43.040]  and basically no takes you know they stopped and started a few times for him to get his articles
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:48.960]  in his hand but he just went off the cuff with the research with the knowledge that's why it came
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:54.000]  off so much more credible than somebody reading off a teleprompter. Folks know when they look at
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.200]  the teleprompter and read to them that it's canned. There's no teleprompters around here.
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:03.440]  We have computer screens that will show what's on television so we can watch a clip or see an
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:09.840]  article but we're just telling you the facts and it makes me physically angry
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:20.240]  that I have to go through hell and high water and tell my children no no no no no no no all
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:26.960]  the time and be neurotic at restaurants and ask them what's in this drink what's in this this
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:33.440]  dessert if I'm going to give them dessert and I have to call the chef out and they go oh there's
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:39.440]  no additives and I go oh really let me see oh we're sorry so there is high fructose corn syrup
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:45.280]  in the pumpkin pie and I'm just like can I just have some pumpkin pie I just spend all this time
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:53.360]  of energy dodging this stuff it's garbage folks it'll kill you they grow it with toxic fertilizers
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.960]  that they have waivers to use in corn production that are full of griniard reagents lead mercury
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:05.760]  arsenic it levels way above swordfish way above blue tuna bluefin tuna
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:12.240]  you wonder why the kids are so you wonder people are 30 years old getting Alzheimer's now
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:17.520]  everywhere I go there's people with neurological disorders just just it's just a wreck
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.960]  look at people's kids I can always tell they're vaccinating them the kids look like they're
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.680]  brain dead look like little dead zombies I want to just warn them sometimes I do it I go hi how

[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:09.040]  high fructose corn syrup everything the Washington Post tested and there's just freaking hundreds of
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:15.440]  these studies hundreds of them everything had mercury and lead in high levels you might as well
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:20.320]  just put mercury drops in your kids food you give my fructose corn syrup and I have to go
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:23.680]  I mean I can't tell you how many birthday parties try to take my kids to and they got bluebell ice

[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:48.800]  disorder when they're 25 and then burying them when they're 40 I'm pissed excuse me I'm not usually
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:53.600]  talking like this but the reason I have trouble even coming on air these days is I'm done okay I'm
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:57:02.080]  right about all this we're right about it we're warning you we're not heroes it's common sense
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:10.800]  to warn everybody and to be upset about this and now fructose I guess just means plant sugar
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:15.200]  so now they're going to call it fructose when it's high fructose what you don't want is high
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:20.560]  fructose corn sugar is best I've researched and I've talked to the medical doctors you name it
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:27.120]  I got a guess coming up I'm gonna go to break and go to Phyllis and actually Jones been holding
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:33.280]  the longest and then Jeff and then then Phyllis and then and then Giovanni and everybody else

[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:55.280]  water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:00.080]  every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:05.040]  five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most americans spend 90
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:10.240]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.280]  smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:19.680]  conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're allergic
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:24.880]  to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing

[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:40.640]  you know europe and the middle east and all the training that's going on there that we're helping
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:47.920]  fund and our um and our allies are helping fund the isis and who now they link directly to the
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:53.840]  shooters but then none of the media will say oh we shouldn't have funded isis i mean again that's
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:57.920]  like putting mercury in the high fructose corn syrup at high levels and it's not even an issue it's
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:06.960]  just all over the top it is it is but but um my concern today and i've i've looked at these articles
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:14.160]  you know several times over the years is the terrorist training cells that are here in the
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:20.960]  united states oh they're here and yeah they are and i was wondering if your guest is coming up could
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:26.720]  you give us some insight into this i'm from georgia and matter of fact i mean i listened to you talk
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:36.320]  about your family from you know the alabo and and in your texas you know roots my georgia roots
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:45.920]  but i have a uh uncle well not an uncle but he's a an ancestor that fought in the war of 1812
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:51.440]  oh yeah against the british and he and there's a couple there's a county in georgia that's
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:03:01.600]  named after him and um his sword is in the state capitol but anyhow that's awesome my family is
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:09.360]  from georgia before the civil war we were here but anyhow um yeah the training camps you know
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:15.280]  there's there's like three and well actually four according to this website that i found oh listen
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.000]  listen i've got new york times articles about terror training camps all over the country where
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:25.200]  they quote our training jihadis to fight other jihadis these are government run they don't
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.000]  need to have secret training camps they've got these jihad training camps all over the us it's
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:38.880]  totally disgusting well well you know uh the the the cities that they lift you know for georgia

[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:27.040]  can dig up from old mainstream articles where some of those government training camps are where they
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.640]  have the blacked out buses going in and that's the kind of thing we need to cover by the way

[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:48.800]  back in 1993 right after the first world trade center attack
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:58.400]  i remember listening to local talk radio where a talk show host was discussing
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:11.280]  the fbi informant the former egyptian military colonel who had under cover for the fbi and
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:16.640]  infiltrated the first al-qaeda cell on american soil in new york city during the 93 world trade
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:21.920]  center bombing he also penetrated the headquarters of al-qaeda in america under the leadership of
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:28.000]  the blind chic omer abdel ramon and the underground terrorist cell who was planning to blow up the
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:34.240]  landmarks in new york city and became a government star witness in the day of the terror trial
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:41.680]  he is the author of undercover the untold story of al-qaeda the fbi and the cia in america
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:49.360]  imad salem dot org i've read the book it came in a few weeks ago extremely powerful
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:55.360]  information now folks we're going to recap today in the next 50-something minutes what happened
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:02.160]  in 93 he sent a lot of photos and clips for tv viewers for radio listeners you can go to info
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:09.120]  wars dot com forward slash show and find the free video feed or by tomorrow we'll have an archive
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:16.880]  of this on the front page of prison planet dot com and info wars dot com but this guy is a patriot
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:22.640]  for freedom and he worked in intelligence operations fought extremists in the middle east
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.840]  egypt one of our biggest allies as you know but trade set up turned over to radicals and the
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:33.760]  military came in and asked them it's a destabilization program that's going on well he came over here
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:40.960]  when egypt was one of our staunchest allies and helped infiltrate these groups and it even came
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:44.720]  out in the new york times i'm going to show tv viewers this radio listeners can look it up
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:53.440]  this is from october 28 93 tapes to pick proposal to thwart bomb used in trade center blast and
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:11:05.280]  mr salem he just to give you a boil down and he'll say it in his own words and in correct areas
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:09.840]  that i don't get exactly right but i made a film about this i've been covering this
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:13.520]  since right after it happened this is one of the reasons i heard a local talk show was talking
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:18.480]  about it went and bought the new york times back then you had to go to a newspaper shop to find them
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:26.000]  reddit couldn't believe the fbi would basically tell him to build the bomb give him real detonators
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.760]  and then tell him let it go forward and then he tried to stop it that was a game changer for me
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:37.280]  then we saw weiko and that cover up in oklahoma city which was clearly another false flag
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:43.040]  that's why i got on air took me two years to get on air i got on air in 95 so
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:50.480]  mr salem's story to show how a rock leaves big ripples in a pond is one of the things that triggered
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:56.720]  his courage is one of the things that triggered this broadcast being on air today and being the
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:02.960]  number one place in the world hands down exposing the fact of operation gladio other operations
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:10.160]  of provocateur terror and an attempt to radicalize liberal groups conservative groups islamic groups
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:17.280]  you name it to discredit them now that's my take on it amad salem can give it to you and his take
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:23.120]  but kernel we appreciate you coming on this is an amazing chance to talk to you your book is
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:28.320]  just amazing i got so much even more insight of course you tried to stop them they tried to
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:34.080]  then set you up i know you then recorded them and so we're able to get a settlement thank god you
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:39.440]  did that because you're one of the only people on the inside to ever get out alive who exposes a
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:45.600]  false flag so you've got the floor sir to recap 1993 and then i know you want to move forward and
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:51.920]  talk about isis about obama about al-qaeda in america you've got some incredible intel for us
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:57.600]  today so god bless you thank you for coming on thank you alex for having me i really appreciate
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:03.120]  the opportunity to give me the platform to talk about the experience i have been through
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:12.720]  since 1990 with the fbi when i started to do covert operation against the russian with the new
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:22.480]  york office for the russian squad at that time i was employed in manhattan in a hotel and i was
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:32.400]  a chief engineer slash head of security and i was approached by one of the fbi agents in the counter
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:44.800]  terrorism in the russian squad and she requested my cooperation and it was a blessing and a great
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:51.600]  deal of ownership for me to assist the fbi to infiltrate this group of russians and this
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:14:01.120]  operation lasted i would say six to eight months and after that uh nancy floyd the fbi agent who
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:08.960]  did recruit me to do that operation moved me to the i in s i did another operation covertly with
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:16.400]  the i in s it resulted into 72 arrests and then i moved into the terrorist squad and that's at
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:24.080]  the beginning of my involvement with the jttf which is the joint terrorist task force the new york
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:34.160]  office and there is few things i would like to correct it that so many news outlets reported
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:40.560]  that i went to the fbi i knocked the door i said i have information that's a false information um
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:47.520]  actually the fbi came to my office in the hotel at that time and requested my cooperation and i was
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:55.840]  completely honored to do with with no return or no payment or no nothing because i did my job
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:02.960]  as a new east citizen so you did it for honor and justice absolutely not a penny for the first
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:09.840]  six months and then another three months for the i in s and then i started with the terrorist squad
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:17.120]  at that time it was assassination in manhattan for a jewish robber his name is ma'ir kahana
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:24.960]  by uh an arab person and the fbi didn't have enough information about what's going on inside
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:34.320]  this group they asked me to go inside and i did and i became a member of elisayud nusair which
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:43.840]  is the assassin of ma'ir kahana the his uh a group of raising fundraising and collecting money to
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:50.560]  support his defense and he was being defended by um a jewish lawyer his name is william
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:56.640]  counselor he is no longer with us now he passed away however say nusair was acquitted in the
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:05.200]  first part but because of the information i provided uh i went to say nusair in prison in yaan and in
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:14.320]  atika and in rikers island and he told me that he did and do the assassination and he described it
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:21.120]  to me in details how he did it because i was one of the insider at that time and he thought that i
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:29.040]  am a fanatic as well and i uh i am going for the assassination of human beings which i don't
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:36.960]  no matter what the agreement or disagreement with somebody else he's a human being i have no rights
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:43.680]  to take his life but that was a fatwa from the blind shake shake omer abder rahman
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:52.080]  um it came a day during my infiltration to say it nusair's group i was approached by
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:59.280]  one of the joint terrorist task force special agent john anticev and he showed me a newspaper
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:04.480]  picture for the blind shake he said do you know this person i said yes this is sheikh omer abder
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:12.720]  rahman who assassinated my president anwar said that at that time i was still in the service in
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:19.600]  the egyptian military and i was present during the parade president said that was assassinated in
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:29.760]  and i said asian john told me that this man is in new jersey i said my god how did he came to
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:36.800]  new jersey he said well that's unknown at this time but uh what do you think i said i think he
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:45.520]  is a very dangerous man this man wherever he go people drop dead and he is on the terrorist list
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:52.960]  how did this man came into america lo and behold he said can you approach him i did approach the
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:18:03.120]  blind shake and i get very close to him um uh uh covently of course and then he asked me to go on
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:12.160]  a trip with him for fundraising into detroit at that time the fbi provided me with the van uh that
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:20.720]  van was electronically bought through a certain chopper they they have their way of recording
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:29.920]  the information but during our trip from new york to detroit the blind shake asked me i heard that
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:37.280]  you are retired from special ops in egypt i said yes sir okay do you are uh do you know how to shoot
[02:18:37.280 --> 02:18:43.520]  yes sir of course are you a sharpshooter i said yes he said okay if you wanted to repent from
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:51.680]  serving an infidel government then you need to assassinate president hosney mobar at that time
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:58.320]  mobarak was coming then next wednesday it was shocking for me to have a straight order from
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:05.920]  the blind shake uh uh because he got the web first from his followers that i'm collecting money for
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:12.320]  say it no sir i'm one of the close people that the no sir group and that's why he attempted to get me
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:20.480]  that order and of course all of that's being recorded on tapes i said okay i think that's a
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:27.920]  good idea i did not decline and i made a point to bring that to the attention of my handlers at
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:36.960]  that time which is special agent john anticep and uh uh detectively we napoli from the terrorist squad
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:45.360]  in the new york office we came back from detroit and uh the blind shake requested me to visit
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:52.960]  sayid no sir in attica i went to visit him in attica he gives me the order to build the bomb
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:58.720]  do you know how to build the bomb i said of course i'm it's special ops he said okay i would like
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:09.440]  you to build the bomb and kidnap uh henry kissinger and judge uh duffy who ruled against him in this
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:17.520]  case and if you can kidnap an FBI agent that would be great so you can bargain to release me i said
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:25.280]  okay shake that's a good idea and i went back i reported that to my handlers from this point on
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:31.840]  i start to ask sayid no sir in the next visit how am i going to build the bombs i don't have
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:38.880]  materials i don't know what to do and that's as per the instructions i was instructed by
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:48.640]  my handlers in the jttf not to dictate or not to suggest targets or not to suggest bombings
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:57.600]  but i always ask open in question and my opening questions how am i going to build the bomb i don't
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:04.720]  have material sayid no sir described to me where to go in kanali street what street what is the name
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:13.440]  of the store where to buy the fuse where to buy the explosives i said great i came back from ataka
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:20.880]  i went to kanali street i bought the fuse and i went to my handlers in the bureau at that time they
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:29.840]  said it is getting very serious we have to bring you up to the asaq the asaq and the fbi means
[02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:37.440]  assistant special agent in charge his name is karson then but and he is in charge of the counter
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:44.560]  terrorism in the new york office at the time i said sayid no sir requested from me to build the bomb
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:51.760]  told me where to get the materials here is the fuse i got it and now i need to know what to do
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:58.880]  he said i gotta put you on the box he said what do you mean box gotta put you on a paragraph well i
[02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:06.320]  have been working with you guys almost for a year now with the russian squad with the with the i in s
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:11.520]  with the new sphere assassination and now you're coming to tell me you want a paragraph me you
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:17.680]  have no trust he said no put me in the paragraph is not going to get a result mr karson he said
[02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:26.160]  why sell him i said because i know how to fool the machine he said i don't care put him on the box
[02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:34.160]  they got an examiner put me on the box and the conclusion came that unconclusive result
[02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:41.040]  so i went to mr dan bar i said i told you so he said i don't care put him on another examiner
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:48.480]  for another paragraph i went for the second paragraph came unconclusive he called washington
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:56.320]  headquarter for the fbi brought the head of the examiners from washington to keep to conduct the
[02:22:56.320 --> 02:23:06.000]  test by himself so it will not be uh unconclusive as usual the gentleman who came from the headquarter
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:13.040]  robbed me wrong and he conducted a test and i proved him that i can fool his machine and i'm
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:21.280]  being frank about it because i have nothing to hide yet he came that uh it is unconclusive
[02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:26.880]  but his feeling is that i am deceptive and that became a personal
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:36.160]  disagreement between me and the examiner he said the third exam in one week and it came
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:41.120]  unconclusive but once he go to washington i became deceptive i said i really sure and just
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:45.360]  to be clear polygraphs are now basically not admissible because all you've got to do is stay
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:50.480]  upset the entire time at every question and then it's just all over the map there's other ways to
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:56.240]  beat them they're only there to fool people into thinking that they know you're lying they do have
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:02.400]  some brain scans now that are more accurate but even those are fraudulent it's a quack machine
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:07.520]  so that they can basically demonize whoever they want but regardless your whole story has come out
[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:12.160]  in the washington post new york times what happened to you was recorded coming up you've
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:16.480]  been proven to be accurate and correct i think the polygraph thing is interesting but not that
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:22.720]  important in the final equation and we have amad Salem the former egyptian military colonel
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:28.480]  worked in intelligence you name it became a citizen moved to the u.s began working with
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:34.960]  the fbi infiltrating very dangerous russian type assassination groups then infiltrating
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:40.400]  uh radical islamic groups that were assassinating people if you just tuned in again the new york
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:46.080]  times tapes to pick proposal to thwart bomb use in trade center blast he's building up to win
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:52.480]  okay they've built the bomb they're they're real terrorist now let's bust them and the fbi
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:57.680]  basically lets it go forward uh continue telling the rest of the story then i want to move forward
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:04.080]  toward to the intel it's really important okay because i mean your take on isis obama the
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:11.360]  radicalization all the things that are happening please mr. Salem yes sir uh it came to the point
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:19.360]  that mr. karsten damberg start to like dislike me personally that there is three examiners come
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:26.160]  on conclusive he insists that i wear a wire i was working as an intelligence gathering
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:34.240]  uh asset as they described it and i never had intention to testify and become a star witness
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:40.720]  and all of the above but at that moment if i wear a wire as he requested i will be obligated
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:46.160]  i'll become a character witness and i'll be obligated to testify in an open court
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:53.440]  and at that time i have a family i have a wife i have two children i don't want to jeopardize
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:26:02.000]  their life by opening this closing my my covert work uh mr. damberg insists i said i'm willing to
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:08.080]  put the to wear the wire and bring you the information on that tape that mr. nussier asked
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:13.440]  me to build the bomb if that's what you're concerned about but i don't testify in court he said no
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:20.480]  then go home i said go home the people asking me to build the bomb you're killing me and i'm the only
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:28.960]  one who is giving you ears and eyes inside the cell you tell me go home he said yes go home i said
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:36.320]  okay and i told the three agents were standing at the door of mr. van bar asian john anisev
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:44.320]  asian liwin aptly you think liwin aptly and asian dancy floing i said okay i'm going home but if
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:53.440]  the bomb got built on they they built and went off don't come and knock on my door that was november
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:27:04.560]  1992 december came and i got bombarded by phone calls from the mask in queens by mahmoud abohalima
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:10.960]  and other members of the cell to come to continue building the bombs and i refused i said i'm scared
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:18.320]  of the fbi they are monitoring me and surveilling me and i pulled completely out of the cell and that's
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:25.120]  at the time when shekha umar reached out for afghanistan and i know how his communication
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:32.320]  to get around being traced he was going to usama billabin the effects machine in his
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:38.960]  bedroom in new jersey because i saw that myself and requested another bomb builder and that's when
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:45.840]  ramsey ahmad yusuf came to the country with ahmad abdah ramsey ahmad yusuf came to the country
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:54.720]  took over building the bomb and at that time i assumed that the fbi continuously monitoring
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:59.680]  these people because i give them their names i give they have their pictures they
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:06.800]  subpoenaed them they have their fingerprints they have the whole information but unfortunately
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:14.080]  they didn't follow up on them ramsey ahmad yusuf came built the bomb went off in 1993
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:20.320]  i was in my front room watching tv and then i hear that there is a bomb went off in the
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:26.080]  workplace center i called my wife and said honey they did it it's been built it's done
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:32.960]  and then as i expected they came to knock on my door come back because the bomb went off
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:42.320]  this is a crucial point it was not a black flag operation it's not a false operation
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:51.280]  it's a real crazy idiots fanatics who wanted to commit jihad under the leadership officer i want
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:57.760]  to be clear and not split hairs here colonel i consider a false flag when you know something's
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:05.040]  going on you've got a 50 billion dollar budget like the fbi and justice department have and then
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:11.600]  you don't go stop people if i know that my neighbor is going to kill his wife tomorrow he tells me
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:14.960]  i'm going to kill my wife when she gets home in the garage and says she committed suicide
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:20.000]  and then he kills her i'm aiding and abetting i'm now an accomplice because i didn't do anything
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.320]  so that's my point yes i know they're real crazy jihadis i understand that i know you tried to
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:31.520]  stop them my point is that's still a false flag in my view because you let them do it but we can
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:36.000]  come back and argue that point i didn't want to move forward to how you recorded them to protect
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:41.600]  yourself and the rest of it and then we're going to come back and get into your view on isis the

[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:25.440]  last one of the fbi was praised for its speed in cracking the case of the world trade center
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:31.680]  bombing and bringing four suspects to trial now there is some evidence that the fbi may have known
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:36.880]  of the plot in advance through an informant and might might even have stopped the bombing that
[02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:44.560]  kills six people correspondent jacklyn adams has the story fbi agents might have been able to prevent
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:50.400]  last february's deadly explosion at new york's world trade center they discussed secretly substituting
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:56.800]  harmless powder for the explosives but they didn't according to the fbi's own informant imad selam
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:03.200]  unbeknownst to the fbi at the time selam recorded many of his conversations with his handlers i'm
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:10.480]  holding 903 pages of draft transcripts ryan consular represents shake oma abdel rakman
[02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:15.200]  and several others charged with conspiring to blow up a series of new york city landmarks four
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:20.960]  months after the world trade center bombing that case has not yet gone to trial consular
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:27.840]  confirmed newspaper reports of the selam transcripts in one selam complains to an fbi agent since the
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:34.320]  bomb went off i feel terrible i feel bad i feel here is people who don't listen the agent replies
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:39.520]  hey i mean it wasn't like you didn't try and i didn't try you can't force people to do the right
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:44.880]  thing there is material in here to show gross governmental misconduct today attorneys for
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:51.840]  the defendants and let's stop right there center bombing case from october 28 to 1993 cbs news using
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:57.440]  that for archival free speech purposes to analyze historical events since then they have declassified
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:06.560]  and released the actual tapes uh that umad selam was able to record to protect himself and we have
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:12.080]  some of those clips if he'd like to go to those we have the clip of that very transcript you just
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:17.600]  heard but we got cut off by the break those are hard breaks absolutely it's not a classic pure
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:22.960]  false flag where you shoot somebody and then frame uh you know somebody else for it but in my view
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:29.360]  it's still letting it happen helping them get the bomb together and having you stand down uh and not
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:33.840]  letting you just you know do your job or them not doing their job and clearly knowing the bombing
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:38.320]  was coming i think that's aiding and abetting it and i don't have some dog in the fight to demonize
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:42.960]  the fbi that's a scary organization it's just that from the perspective i've got in oklahoma
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:50.240]  city and other events uh this is something they've done before your your take on that sir
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:58.000]  yes sir uh for you to understand what really happened you need to know how with that fbi
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:08.160]  the new york office used to work at that time they are two division humps and suits the humps is
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:15.200]  john ante seven nancy floyd and lee ween aptly and c fear the special agents this is the humps
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:22.720]  who sweat on the street who do their best to protect and clean up american streets the suit
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:29.680]  sitting in their offices as mr karsten dan bar used to sit in the office put his legs on the desk
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:38.400]  and talk from the tip of his nose i saw john and c fear and nancy floyd and all of these agents
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:46.080]  sweating begging mr dan barb to keep me in the cell and continue the investigation he said no
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:53.200]  send him home and when the bomb went off he sent the agents to bring me back to go back undercover
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:37:02.640]  so i wouldn't throw the blame on the fbi period that the listeners and you would like to understand
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:09.280]  because i was there i walk the walk and i talk the talk and i am not afraid of nobody if i am
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:17.280]  afraid i wouldn't go undercover with assassins and evil doers hiding behind the name of islam
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:27.680]  these people i mean the fbi with their fight between the management and of course today
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:33.680]  is a whole different story at that time in the nineties terrorism was something brand new and
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:39.840]  for them to hear that somebody that orders to build the bomb and go in manhattan and so on and
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:46.720]  it is crazy for them but i wouldn't throw the blame on the special agents that i understand
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:51.200]  you're saying it's the bureaucracy that's what the late john o'neill said did you ever talk to
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:56.880]  john o'neill because he gave a speech in england months before he died saying and he was of course
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:00.400]  the deputy director of the fbi the head of counterterrorism for those that don't know
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:05.600]  the government's going to let al qaeda attack us to take liberties a big change is coming
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:11.040]  he quits the fbi goes to work at the world trade center the week of nine eleven and then dies in
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:17.520]  it yes i mean this is bizarre so so let's put bookends on the 93 event and then give us your
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:23.200]  incredible info and expertise on what's happening in the middle east what barack obama really stands
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:30.880]  for isis all of it i'm i'm going to give you the floor sir this is one very important point i would
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:40.880]  like to explain it to your listeners why why president barack is saying not hitting hard on
[02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:50.720]  the terrorist and on isis and i know it sounds crazy but bear with me president barack was born
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:59.600]  after his older brother malik the father mr hasain named his son malik and that's one of god's names
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:09.200]  in islam the second son he named him burak what is burak me burak is the right prophet muhammad
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:18.240]  and we can see mr malik sitting with mr obama visiting him in the white house mr malik is in
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:26.000]  charge of the muslim brotherhood in africa there's a lot of finances going on through mr malik
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:33.680]  and we can see him in another picture holding the yamanian dagger on his waist and he is a big
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:42.240]  supporter to the muslim brotherhood and that explains that mr burak is saying is not hitting
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:49.760]  hard on the muslim brotherhood on the contrary he took them off the terrorist list for years and
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:55.760]  years the muslim brotherhood is on the terrorist list around the world in the europe world who
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:02.160]  knows them best but mr burak decided to take them off the terrorist list and start to be
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:08.960]  sponsoring them and put them in charge of egypt again is the egyptian population i am originally
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:17.200]  egyptian i have ears and eyes on the roads of egypt on a minute by minute and i know that every
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:23.600]  egyptian dislike the decision of putting the muslim brotherhood in charge of egypt but that's
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:31.200]  the way mr burak wanted to be it took one year and the entire population ripped the muslim brotherhood
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:38.720]  off that they're taking over the government in egypt and now they are in trial in jail guess what
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:45.920]  when mr burak slowed down in his support to the muslim brotherhood they threatened him and i have
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:54.480]  that frontage in ahram newspaper muslim brotherhood threatening obama they if he stopped supporting them
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:41:03.680]  they will release secret documents to put him in prison verbatim words our listeners and our media
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:10.640]  in america the mainstream media will not put that will not like to hear that they don't want to hear
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:17.520]  by the way colonel amad salam very famous um fbi informant infiltrator of assassin groups you name
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:22.320]  it successfully helping send him to prison infiltrating the world trade center bombing of 93
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:28.160]  have you just joined us i've interviewed doctors areum coursey i've interviewed colonel schaefer
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:34.640]  and i've got a bunch of other sources off record in congress in the senate everything he's saying
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:40.560]  i heard two years ago before it was even in the egyptian newspapers they have obama's family
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:46.160]  not just his brother but odinga and others they're the ones that did the uprisings in kenya tried
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:52.000]  to basically overthrow it this is incredible and they're siphoning tens of millions a month
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:56.400]  up to the muslim brotherhood in an attempted takeover and when i first learned about this i
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:02.560]  couldn't believe it that a us president bare minimum is being blackmailed by the muslim brotherhood
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:09.120]  to carry all this out uh i mean it's really happening i always thought that would be like
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:14.240]  his llamaphobia or something i i just couldn't believe it it was too big a conspiracy now it's
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:19.920]  admitted so break down i mean so what you're saying is the intel from egypt where you were
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:26.480]  a colonel in intelligence is that obama is being blackmailed or is he a willing accomplice of the
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:32.480]  radical jihadist uh first i would like to correct one thing i'm not a colonel in the intelligence
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:37.680]  it's an honor i would i wouldn't assume it i am not in the well i just i just read the new york
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:43.600]  times you were a colonel that worked in intelligence and other operations no i am not an intelligence
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:50.640]  officer i have so many friends since i served in the military they were serving me in a small
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:55.520]  units and they went to intelligence and we have friendly connections the new york times got that
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:00.640]  wrong what was your role as a colonel in the egyptian army i was in the arms ammunition
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:08.480]  division ah and i was in charge uh and i was in the special ops but i was not an an intelligence
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:13.680]  okay good the new york times got that wrong years ago i want to clear this point quickly mr
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:22.240]  burak obama's upbringing with a father who believed in fanaticism to the point that he named his first
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:30.480]  son malik on god's name and the second son burak which is the right of prophet muhammad and then
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:38.080]  he was growing up in this environment as a muslim and when he came to united states
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:45.200]  let us see he decided to be christian i'll go for that but what kind of church mr president went to
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:56.000]  mr white's a fanatic priest who is condemning america and going again is america mr burak's
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:02.160]  heart is a muslim i have no problem with that because i am a muslim myself but don't go to the
[02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:09.200]  fanatics take them over terrorist list start supporting them and then i have to pay the price
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:18.160]  as an american citizen we are paying the price for increasing the power of the muslim brotherhood
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:27.760]  the muslim brotherhood as i said comes from the roots of or they are the roots of ices
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:36.000]  if you go to the ices tree and i can see the ices tree it started from the bottom
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:44.960]  as the hasan el banna and then after him it came uh uh uh i'm an izawahri and then
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:52.000]  shei khamar abdel rahman and then it came a point when somebody by the name uh uh
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:58.960]  um muhammad abdel salam muhammad abdel salam is the first one who switched the muslim brotherhood
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:07.200]  from being an organization fighting the british occupation during the nasir era into a violent
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:14.400]  organization and they attempted to assassinate the malabdel nasir they attempted to assassinate uh
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:22.960]  um muhammad said that until the blind shake succeeded to do it and he was elected the prince
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:32.400]  of jihad on the global level and for a long time the blind shake after god helped me to put him in
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:41.600]  jail he was running his organization through lynn steward his attorney by making press releases
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:46.560]  to give orders to his followers in egypt i'll shift gears back to my statement though when i
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:51.040]  described your room course he rolled in daily their investigations saying basically you said
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:56.160]  getting back to people in obama's family financing the muslim brotherhood in egypt that horrible
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:01.120]  overthrow the burning of the churches the killing of the military the end of free speech all the
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:06.640]  tyranny that expanded in egypt do you agree with my statement that bare minimum obama is being
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:11.920]  blackmailed you said that was in the egyptian papers yes he is being blackmailed but he put
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:18.160]  himself in the opposition i understand so he was a willing accomplice and then now is being
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:24.800]  blackmailed now he's being blackmailed and that's why he stopped the the the the apache
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:31.920]  helicopters to go to egypt and alienated united states from the entire arab world egypt at the
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:39.360]  heart of the arab world and saudi arabia in a rage the dubai they all surround in egypt and now
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:47.280]  they are pulling out of united states and mr putin jumping in head down and start to send
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:54.560]  the egyptian people now eating caviar once a week by mr putin why he's doing that he's taking
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:47:03.200]  the opportunity that mr obama is no longer liked by the egyptian what do you think the grand strategy
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:08.560]  is to overthrow egypt that sounds completely insane but they they tried it lasted for one year
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:13.600]  until 20 million people hit the streets i mean why would obama want to put people in charge
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:19.840]  that we're crucifying christians in the streets for no reason why well he's not per se wanted to
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:27.600]  crucify christians but he is heartedly supporting the muslim brotherhood who will kill christians as
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:34.800]  you just mentioned and they continue to do that until the military took over egypt and now egypt
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:41.440]  is being alienated from united states the main goal the final goal is to have to american control
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:50.640]  islamic control over africa that's it that's yep that is africa the ball and that is what dr isam
[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:58.320]  el haddad was sent by mr khairat is shorter from egypt the united states to the white house have the
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:06.080]  instruction from the white house go back to egypt and start to go back to mr malik in africa
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:11.920]  to spread the muslim brotherhood wing over africa and then africa exactly but not but i mean not
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:16.880]  genuine aslam as you said this radical form with criminal elements of our government backing it
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:24.320]  as a secret army i i think that's clear getting into other perspectives on isis uh on uh obama
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:28.880]  and others being caught helping fund them is that blowback now when they go into iraq what's the
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:36.400]  inside intel as an egyptian uh kernel and then an fbi asset what's your expert take on what's
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:43.520]  happening currently and and what we saw in paris well as you know that the head of isis was one
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:50.480]  of our prisoners in guantanamo yes and then we release him and then we say oops there is so many
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:59.680]  opps has been going on after we release mr el baghdadi we say ops and then and today everybody
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:06.560]  works for his own best interest of course mr el baghdadi created his followers which is originally
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:14.560]  supported by the muslim brotherhood backed up by hamas in palestine hamas hamas is the military arm
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:22.240]  of the muslim brotherhood they are all connected it is one tree it started from egypt under one
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:28.160]  leadership and that is the prince of jihad the blind sheikh sheikh omer abdel rahman i'm going to
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:34.400]  tell you one thing i'm following sheikh omer abdel rahman very closely and sadly for the first time
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:43.440]  since 20 years ago he was taken out of prison put in a hospital to prepare for his what they call it
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:50.000]  transfer at the beginning the state department said oh we're going to release him and then the
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:56.800]  media went crazy you cannot release the guy has american blood on his hand oh well we will transfer
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:04.560]  him and then this is ridiculous he has just been executed i don't know about the capital
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:13.520]  uh punishment in in new york the guy should be in prison he is not in prison i will bet you
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:20.160]  something here we have two or a year and three quarter left to mr brock he will release the
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:28.160]  sheikh before he leave office to shut the muslim brotherhood forever and you can quote me on that

[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:34.720]  country would elect somebody who you don't even know really where they're from and then they've
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:41.520]  got all these brothers and people and cousins that are radicals who've been caught trying to
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:50.560]  basically overthrow Kenya before man this is this country is is in trouble and then they did overthrow
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:57.120]  egypt for a year and had a reign of terror and i used to hear all the right wingers talk about
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:03.360]  this and i just would roll my eyes because people call me a conspiracy theorist sometimes
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:08.000]  truth is so strange i can't even believe it everybody should get his book it is a page

[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:34.640]  happening and going on but you were saying off air one of my producers you can say this in your
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:41.600]  own words about um i mean did you say that obama and others are trying to radicalize islam what's
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:47.840]  your view on that and some of the wahabi is out of Saudi arabia what's the agenda there well i think
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:56.640]  i think that mr obama's heart is for the radical islam but of course he has to show the presidency
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:05.040]  for the american people completely but all of his behavior it just shows his support to the muslim
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:13.280]  brotherhood which is against the egyptian peoples and against their wishes today the united states
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:19.520]  of america have been alienated from egypt from Saudi arabia from dubai from the only country
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:28.000]  with united states at this time is Qatar and when we took the five Taliban leader and released them
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:36.720]  they are fanatics and radicals and you gotta imagine if these people today leaving ices from
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:43.280]  Qatar or not you cannot in the day of the internet to control what they will say and to who would
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:51.200]  they say i think mr obama i have no problem for him to be loving to islam i am a muslim myself
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:59.360]  but please mr brock please do not go for the fanatics and the radicals because it
[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:06.800]  bounced back to america america is being hated as a government not at the american people in the
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:12.560]  middle east because of what you have been doing oh yeah pakistan is mad at us for supporting radicals
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:17.760]  people act like the middle east loves radicals they hate them unfortunately that's the price
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:23.760]  the american people you and i will pay that we get alienated from the middle east and when we
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:31.360]  go ask them to help us to fight ices of course they say if you're coming to support a terrorist
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:37.680]  organization called the muslim brotherhood you coming now wanted the tales of the muslim brotherhood
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:44.720]  which is ices you want us to help you fight it sorry and they walk away and they went far from
[02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:52.800]  united states to get their weapons from russia and from china and then lo and behold russia will
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:59.520]  start to spread their wings on the middle east and we lose our leadership role around the world
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:09.040]  america i immigrated to the united states of america and it is the supreme power on the planet
[02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:17.200]  and we should maintain that increase the military power and increase our leadership around the planet
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:26.160]  not to shy from being american i am proud to be one it was my choice and i will maintain it

[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:44.960]  five minutes here left with you sir i want to give you the floor to talk about anything else you
[03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:51.120]  want to get into but briefly i wanted to ask you about the agenda we're seeing with this attack
[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:56.640]  on the cartoon i mean obviously it's obnoxious really hateful stuff but that place is connected
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:01.840]  different intelligence agencies it seems like there's an attempt to cause provocations and a
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:08.080]  clash of civilization uh to try to root the united states out of the middle east and that
[03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:14.320]  seems to be what obama is doing as well what do you think the grand strategy is here uh i don't
[03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:20.000]  know about the grand strategy i'm not preview to this intel but i will tell you something it makes
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:27.920]  me very suspicious to hear the assassins who commit the evil doers who commit this massacre
[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:35.600]  saying oh we are al-qaeda from yemen oh really if that is what you go to announce yourself in
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:42.880]  advance before you go kill 12 people that you are coming representing al-qaeda from yemen or that's
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:53.680]  just a road to go and probably probably i'm not so sure about that invade yemen i don't know i agree
[03:01:53.680 --> 03:01:58.160]  no clearly this this this whole thing's things to heaven i don't know the truth about it but it's it
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:03.680]  isn't adding up as more stuff comes in we've got an open mind here other points you'd like to make
[03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:10.080]  sure and tell us about your new book my new book is talking about my life i'm living under assumed
[03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:18.640]  identity for the last 25 years which it takes a big toll on my family and myself every once in a
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:24.960]  while we get assumed identity in you assumed identity you start from the scratch we move from
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:36.320]  state to state we moved 15 times it caused money it caused pain it caused suffering and i choose
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:45.840]  to do that because six people got killed in the first bombing in 1993 i am confident if mr
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:56.800]  uh uh uh uh the the fbi asak mr dan bar let me to continue the investigation i will be the one
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:03:03.440]  who continue to build the bomb under the eyes of the fbi as we did in the other five bombs in the
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:10.960]  day of terror trial i went back undercover and the people underground came and we built five bombs
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:18.240]  under the supervision of the fbi and the video surveillance and we substitute the real explosives
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:27.440]  with just harmful liquids and fertilizer and they arrested all of them 12 of them got arrested and
[03:03:28.320 --> 03:03:36.080]  that's why i wrote my first book to reveal the reality it really hurt me bad that mr dan bar
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:46.240]  sent me to go work covertly and then he released an article in the new york post or at least i think
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:52.160]  i don't have the proof yet i think he is the one who made that release because this is a covert
[03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:59.440]  operation in the jttf how the reporter in the new york post will know about it a month before we
[03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:05.840]  took the case down and i insist to continue because i don't want another three four thousand people to
[03:04:05.840 --> 03:04:17.360]  get killed but mr uh uh karson dan bar has to release to the new york post that we have undercover
[03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:24.800]  operation with a fanatic that was crazy and that will make other muslims afraid to step forward
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:29.760]  well i agree and now that isis is spreading all over the world i would expect they're going to be
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:34.880]  attacking or their copycats are all over the place and they can take american liberties
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:38.880]  i want to invite you back on to do a whole hour in a month or so sir to talk about
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:43.200]  life under an assumed identity i know you broke that today to come on and you know with your real
[03:04:43.200 --> 03:04:49.600]  name uh and do this so be safe out there i have a great weekend that's coming up and god bless
