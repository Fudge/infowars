[00:00.000 --> 00:20.520]  years ago I would play air raid sirens maybe once a month on air when I was
[00:20.520 --> 00:24.160]  talking about something really hardcore then about a year ago I tried to play an
[00:24.160 --> 00:28.800]  air raid sirens about once a week then about three months ago four months ago
[00:28.800 --> 00:31.840]  right before all this big virus hysteria started I began playing it
[00:31.840 --> 00:38.640]  every hour on the hour and as of late I've been airing it several times an hour
[00:38.640 --> 00:46.680]  and I said a few months ago this notes in my mind how much martial law were
[00:46.680 --> 00:51.240]  under well now that we're under martial law in the blue cities in blue
[00:51.240 --> 00:54.560]  states and they're openly using it to set the precedent of absolutely no
[00:54.560 --> 01:00.480]  freedoms with extreme enjoyment I'm now to just play air raid sirens all the
[01:00.480 --> 01:05.480]  time because that's what you hear either when you're under enemy missile
[01:05.480 --> 01:12.240]  bombardment or bomber bombardment or when you are meant to stay in your
[01:12.240 --> 01:18.400]  homes now all across the United States the reports are flooding in and the
[01:18.400 --> 01:22.360]  police departments are playing even more frightening sounding air raid sirens
[01:22.360 --> 01:28.200]  than the classic ones used in England in World War two and popularized in Godzilla
[01:28.200 --> 01:33.600]  movies after that here's an air raid siren from last night in America
[01:43.160 --> 01:50.200]  that's Crowley Louisiana we'll show you the newscast in a moment it is the air
[01:50.200 --> 01:54.040]  raid siren from the movie the purge of course just like the big red siren it's
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.960]  meant to terrorize you in New York this is all done by design but here's the LA
[01:58.960 --> 02:05.760]  mayor who sources told us on Saturday and I made some phone calls to a police
[02:05.760 --> 02:13.840]  officer I know in Los Angeles we got this from the department there in Orange
[02:13.840 --> 02:19.600]  County that within two weeks they're gonna say do not leave your home period
[02:19.600 --> 02:25.160]  for the grocery store even drug stores they plan to close those to create
[02:25.160 --> 02:29.320]  civil unrest once the National Guard is fully on the streets Trump's not doing
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.440]  this but the blue cities blue states are here is snitch culture being
[02:34.440 --> 02:38.800]  completely glorified where you henpeck your neighbors how do you know they're
[02:38.800 --> 02:41.000]  not going to take care of grandma how do you know they're not going to take care
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.600]  of their farm how do you know they don't work in an essential area this is
[02:44.600 --> 02:49.520]  creating the illusion see first it's just a two-week vacation oh it's all gonna
[02:49.520 --> 02:53.800]  come back to normal oh then it's a month and it's two months they want to set the
[02:53.800 --> 02:57.240]  precedent it's forever this is the shutdown of America this is the
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.640]  deindustrialization here is the evil globalist mayor of Los Angeles if you've
[03:02.640 --> 03:06.800]  observed recurring violations of the safer at home order please continue to
[03:06.800 --> 03:10.120]  let us know at coronavirus.lacity.org
[03:10.120 --> 03:15.640]  slash business violation you know the old expression about snitches well in
[03:15.640 --> 03:21.960]  this case snitches get rewards we want to thank you for turning folks in and
[03:21.960 --> 03:29.000]  making sure we are all safe this is not they live it's not a 1984 remake it's
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.600]  America in April 2020 China sets the precedent he rolls it out Hollywood
[03:35.600 --> 03:41.400]  pushes it the blue city say you must have total martial law then they have
[03:41.400 --> 03:46.360]  the martial law then the numbers are much lower of death because they hype
[03:46.360 --> 03:51.680]  the virus bigger than it was and their fake graphs cast themselves the heroes
[03:51.680 --> 03:59.040]  and permanently set stage so there you go Los Angeles is under authoritarian
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.480]  martial law there weren't any riots there weren't any problems they made that
[04:03.480 --> 04:06.840]  happen and now in LA now in New York the articles came out yesterday the
[04:06.840 --> 04:12.200]  statistics last month of the lockdown guess what happened crime has gone up
[04:12.200 --> 04:17.440]  30 plus percent in LA and over 50 percent of property crimes businesses being
[04:17.440 --> 04:23.840]  broken into in New York I've got those articles here crime explodes of course it
[04:23.840 --> 04:29.600]  does of course it does and many people won't get their checks for months and so
[04:29.600 --> 04:33.560]  you're going to see civil unrest and then they had stock markets going down down
[04:33.560 --> 04:39.200]  down this is economic war America is under attack they painted Trump into a
[04:39.200 --> 04:43.120]  corner that every death happens is it is his fault if he doesn't lock us in
[04:43.120 --> 04:51.320]  houses like Pharaoh kings in our tombs info wars.com news wars.com they're
[04:51.320 --> 04:54.720]  shutting all the free speech down right now as well so spread the links live
[04:54.720 --> 05:02.280]  show while you still can as bad as things are with now more than half the
[05:02.280 --> 05:06.960]  world population under martial law being directed by the UN there is a
[05:06.960 --> 05:11.720]  massive awakening happening to the tyranny of big pharma and the medical
[05:11.720 --> 05:16.480]  mafia and the forced inoculations of the UN admitting that vaccines are
[05:16.480 --> 05:21.080]  killing people and they've covered it up and everywhere I go I am just mobbed by
[05:21.080 --> 05:25.640]  folks on the street now even in leftist Austin who used to attack me just a few
[05:25.640 --> 05:31.400]  years ago saying you were right about 5G 5G is killing us I looked it up it's
[05:31.400 --> 05:36.520]  causing cancer it destroys immunity it says that it makes it easier for viruses
[05:36.520 --> 05:42.360]  to attack people are really starting to wake up and they know they're under
[05:42.360 --> 05:49.000]  attack at a spiritual and subconscious cellular level so now my friends educate
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  everyone you know they're ready to listen they're ready to learn they're
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.800]  ready to take action I'm Alex Jones and this is the info war
[06:05.320 --> 06:11.400]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming
[06:11.400 --> 06:24.160]  to you live from the front lines of the info the club of Rome the Council on
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.000]  Five Relations the Rockefeller Foundation the Carnegie Foundation the
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.920]  World Health Organization the United Nations and countless other
[06:32.920 --> 06:39.200]  organizations have publicly for 40 years or more really 50 years if you count the
[06:39.200 --> 06:46.440]  club of Rome back in the early 60s have openly said that they would bring in
[06:46.440 --> 06:52.440]  world government with a controlled release of a bio weapon or a naturally
[06:52.440 --> 06:56.360]  occurring plague that they would cross the nation state crush basic liberties
[06:56.360 --> 07:00.680]  crush new process with it but they just need to have a surveillance system in
[07:00.680 --> 07:06.920]  place using the internet they said that back in the 60s to track and control and
[07:06.920 --> 07:12.720]  trace your every movement the internet was invented publicly in 1963 it was
[07:12.720 --> 07:19.080]  actually developed in a DARPA secret program in 1958 that's all declassified
[07:19.080 --> 07:24.320]  now Eisenhower warns you of it and it is an internet of things to have
[07:24.320 --> 07:32.040]  surveillance and robots controlling everything you do and hurting everyone
[07:32.040 --> 07:38.160]  into compact dense cities my film in game documents this all and now all of
[07:38.160 --> 07:42.840]  the United States they have robots driving around they have this in Japan
[07:42.840 --> 07:48.120]  they have this in South Korea they have it in China saying stay indoors stay in
[07:48.120 --> 07:56.680]  doors like literal Daleks from dr. Who this is the revolution against
[07:56.680 --> 08:04.200]  humanity this is the globalist takeover and so yes the virus is man-made so
[08:04.200 --> 08:10.120]  they understand its trajectory yes it's a chimera engineered in US labs sold
[08:10.120 --> 08:19.160]  to China in 2015 now a medical doctor a microbiologist who also worked in
[08:19.160 --> 08:23.200]  secretive areas as a colonel in the Pentagon dealing with bio weapons has
[08:23.200 --> 08:30.400]  come out and said it's a chimera it's manufactured it either leaked or it was
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.040]  released on purpose well you heard that here nine weeks ago with dr. Boyle so
[08:35.040 --> 08:39.400]  the virus is serious but the way they've hyped it and the way they push it the
[08:39.400 --> 08:43.120]  way they've said we can't reopen till there's not one case well that's
[08:43.120 --> 08:47.640]  impossible and because this is a chimera it won't burn itself out quickly
[08:47.640 --> 08:50.960]  that's probably why they designed it many experts believe so that it keeps
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.160]  mutating through different mutagenic patterns that have already been tested
[08:55.160 --> 09:01.560]  in a laboratory and mathematically prepared this is not your grandpa's
[09:01.560 --> 09:06.760]  common cold so it is serious if you don't have zinc vitamin D vitamin C at
[09:06.760 --> 09:11.200]  high levels and even if you get that when you're super super old you have
[09:11.200 --> 09:18.760]  problems absorbing it to the cells and it's why you die so it is a threat but
[09:18.760 --> 09:22.440]  the everything behind it and what they're doing with it is the takeover so
[09:22.440 --> 09:25.120]  people say well wait a minute should I get prepared should I get ready you say
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.120]  it's gonna burn itself out looks like they're starting to happen but they say
[09:29.120 --> 09:33.040]  people are reinfected and it's coming back it'll be back next year because the
[09:33.040 --> 09:37.200]  martial law is never going away you're being eased into it then they'll release
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.160]  it for a while and say see you behaved yourself everything's okay so that each
[09:41.160 --> 09:46.360]  time they clamp it down even tighter you won't resist until finally they hit you
[09:46.360 --> 09:50.960]  with the decapitation and that's in the special little three-minute piece we
[09:50.960 --> 09:59.160]  put together two years ago titled this is why they banned Alex Jones and we lay
[09:59.160 --> 10:04.640]  it all out and predict it all including bio attack so it's here but let's let's
[10:04.640 --> 10:11.760]  let's bring the air raid sirens back in for the ambiance it gives us and now I
[10:11.760 --> 10:16.720]  air raid sirens are airing in Europe the United States everywhere Australia's
[10:16.720 --> 10:23.600]  airing these here why don't you hear from the Los Angeles mayor who set to
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.200]  announce you may not leave your home period they're gonna order grocery
[10:27.200 --> 10:34.400]  stores and even pharmacy shut that's their plan in about a week and a half to
[10:34.400 --> 10:37.520]  make Trump look bad when he's trying to reopen the economy well how is LA
[10:37.520 --> 10:40.600]  saying he came and leave your house the mayor's gonna say for at least a week or
[10:40.600 --> 10:46.400]  two you don't want you to leave your house to stop total spread get your
[10:46.400 --> 10:51.640]  groceries get your drugs you have two days that means he's talking illegal
[10:51.640 --> 10:54.920]  drugs but he's saying pharmacy drugs that's gonna cause civil unrest and
[10:54.920 --> 10:58.960]  panic they're trying to trigger a panic Bill Maher and other globalists called
[10:58.960 --> 11:02.200]  for to totally kill the economy right as Trump tries to start reopening in a
[11:02.200 --> 11:05.640]  week and a half two weeks now that's from the police what they've been told
[11:05.640 --> 11:09.200]  and they see right through it but what are they gonna do with the orders come
[11:09.200 --> 11:14.000]  down it's time to not enforce that's why they know police aren't enforcing this
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.640]  they do a few PR deals you know right and take us for folks at the beach or
[11:17.640 --> 11:20.320]  whatever who are by themselves walking their dog France is not doing the same
[11:20.320 --> 11:24.440]  thing but the average cops not following this they know it's BS so now
[11:24.440 --> 11:31.640]  they're telling citizens we're gonna pay you $200 per person you report and he
[11:31.640 --> 11:34.880]  goes on the press conference do you know when they went to school do you know
[11:34.880 --> 11:38.480]  they're working do you know if it's really a job they're going to give us
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.760]  the intel we want to prosecute them but they're letting rapist murderers
[11:42.760 --> 11:47.600]  criminals out and pass the law you give somebody hepatitis A, B or C or HIV and
[11:47.600 --> 11:52.600]  kill them and it's not even a misdemeanor pedophilia they have a
[11:52.600 --> 11:57.920]  bill of legalized pedophilia in California that's okay though huh but you
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.000]  leave your damn house to walk your dog you're going to jail here is the evil
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.040]  mayor if you've observed recurring violations of the safer at home order

[12:12.760 --> 12:17.680]  violation you know the old expression about snitches well in this case
[12:17.680 --> 12:23.960]  snitches get rewards we want to thank you for turning folks in and making sure
[12:23.960 --> 12:30.600]  we are all safe turning folks in making sure we're all safe how about we turn
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.440]  you in you bug-eyed demon now this is Louisiana we have similar bleeding
[12:36.440 --> 12:43.760]  alarms that sound like Star Trek alarms in France like and and they've got
[12:43.760 --> 12:50.400]  other things like fog horns in New York whoa a better life off-world so it's
[12:50.400 --> 12:55.920]  just like Blade Runner and the blimps floating by was whoa I mean you're not
[12:55.920 --> 13:00.600]  in a free country anymore and if they set the precedent for this it's over
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.720]  they admit that you know one thing though all the trying to convince you is
[13:04.720 --> 13:08.680]  over with now huh I told you it was coming it's all scripted it's all
[13:08.680 --> 13:14.320]  prepared unbelievable and of course real people are dying but they're showing
[13:14.320 --> 13:20.120]  footage of dummies and bloody dummies and footage of people in in in Italy
[13:20.120 --> 13:23.760]  when there's not enough respirators to create hysteria turns out almost got
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.520]  plenty turns out mainstream news is running fake videos of people saying
[13:28.520 --> 13:32.040]  they've seen the dead and it's all fake we're gonna get to that again the
[13:32.040 --> 13:36.480]  medial say jones says no one died it's not real no I said they're hyping it to
[13:36.480 --> 13:42.480]  create hysteria it's like you have a fire in the engine room of a ship you're
[13:42.480 --> 13:45.640]  putting it out it's put out there's still smoke and somebody runs around the
[13:45.640 --> 13:49.880]  ship going abandoned ship it's sinking it's sinking the boiler the boiler
[13:49.880 --> 13:53.520]  blue people are jumping off the ship hysterical that's the issue there is a
[13:53.520 --> 13:58.320]  fire but the ship's not going down unless we go crazy and abandon the damn
[13:58.320 --> 14:07.440]  thing so here's a Louisiana out last night with the Eric Zards
[14:17.520 --> 14:22.040]  unless you think I'm joking here's a newscast where the police are saying we
[14:22.040 --> 14:26.440]  won't you know how deadly the virus is so yes we're going around at night doing
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.840]  this and no one's even out it's all part of the state terrorizing everyone
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.480]  wanting to be God and you know we know it's about Louisiana it's a great state
[14:34.480 --> 14:38.880]  but it's under Napoleonic law it's one of the few states doesn't really have the
[14:38.880 --> 14:43.200]  same Constitution at the state level here it is
[14:43.200 --> 15:01.240]  that siren known by many from the movie the purge was not received well by some
[15:01.240 --> 15:05.960]  living in Crowley Chris Walty spoke to the chief on his decision to sound the
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.040]  siren as a part of the city's car let's stop there now let me go out to break
[15:11.040 --> 15:15.560]  with the World Health Organization saying we're gonna go in your houses to
[15:15.560 --> 15:19.480]  make sure you're okay so see we're gonna pass your threshold we're gonna
[15:19.480 --> 15:24.160]  violate the Magna Carta we're going to violate your freedom to make sure you're

[15:34.800 --> 15:39.080]  transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.640]  household at family level in some senses transmission has been taken off the
[15:43.640 --> 15:50.000]  streets and pushed back into family units oh now we need to go and look in
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them

[19:35.520 --> 19:38.920]  doctors they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then
[19:38.920 --> 19:42.280]  every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Groob and those commercials I said

[20:48.680 --> 20:54.120]  including for groceries including for medicine that's why the press corps keeps

[21:27.480 --> 21:30.160]  police don't have a problem the FAA doesn't have a problem with that it's
[21:30.160 --> 21:34.120]  just if you're fighting back against that they do this is the anti-covid 19
[21:34.120 --> 21:38.880]  volunteer drone task force please maintain a social distance at all times
[21:38.880 --> 21:43.400]  here in the homeland but the borders wide open and the homeless are exempt and
[21:43.400 --> 21:48.160]  the jihadis are exempt and the Chinese ship in dirty masks and testing kits
[21:48.160 --> 21:52.560]  giving it to us but that's okay don't worry about that now say tongue and GZ
[21:52.560 --> 21:56.600]  ping are our friends Donald Trump is bad this is CBS news covering it
[21:56.600 --> 22:25.320]  breathlessly thank you for your cooperation so it starts with oh if
[22:25.320 --> 22:29.600]  you see any in any unattended bags tell the airport and oh we're gonna search
[22:29.600 --> 22:33.760]  in check you but we let the jihadis into the country you can fly in of your
[22:33.760 --> 22:36.480]  jihadis from known terrorist countries with a terrorist background but we're
[22:36.480 --> 22:40.840]  gonna funnel your five-year-old and see once you put up with that well now
[22:40.840 --> 22:44.440]  you're gonna put up with it on the streets and everywhere and now that is
[22:44.440 --> 22:50.400]  like something out of a nightmare dystopian film or novel but here it
[22:50.400 --> 22:54.920]  is it's unfolding just like Walmart has these big towers saying six feet six
[22:54.920 --> 23:00.200]  feet and of course it's 20 feet 50 feet 100 feet it's all crap it's a power grab
[23:00.200 --> 23:06.960]  Bill and the gates cooked it all up with the UN Club of Rome CFR Rockefeller
[23:06.960 --> 23:11.000]  Foundation I've named all the white papers everybody goes and reads it when
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.200]  it says we will bring out an authoritarian world government and crush
[23:14.200 --> 23:17.480]  the family and individual liberty with this and now there's articles out in
[23:17.480 --> 23:21.880]  salon and the New York Times families it's terrible that families are allowed
[23:21.880 --> 23:25.960]  to stay together your families are hurtful and hurt children and what and
[23:25.960 --> 23:29.440]  and they're the problem and we've got to get in the houses the UN says it make
[23:29.440 --> 23:31.960]  sure the families aren't spreading it because just because you're in your house
[23:31.960 --> 23:36.400]  isn't safe enough we need armed men in all the houses and they catch all the
[23:36.400 --> 23:42.160]  public officials out doing whatever they want so you need to understand what's
[23:42.160 --> 23:48.440]  happening ladies and gentlemen let's go ahead and go to what's happening at
[23:48.440 --> 23:54.680]  Walmart please remember to wash your hands often stay home if you are sick
[23:54.680 --> 23:59.440]  and practice good social separation of at least six feet when possible
[23:59.440 --> 24:05.160]  loitering inside or outside of the store is strictly prohibited thank you for
[24:05.160 --> 24:11.720]  choosing Walmart now let's talk about how this happened they have continental
[24:11.720 --> 24:17.280]  government COG and the infregard program started by Bush Jr. it's still in
[24:17.280 --> 24:20.520]  effect where all these big mega corporations are seen as essential but
[24:20.520 --> 24:23.640]  they're really the essential essential in the future they will be the FEMA
[24:23.640 --> 24:27.720]  camps they will be the company store so you go back to the old science fiction
[24:27.720 --> 24:33.360]  book short story written under a pseudonym by Stephen King it's actually a
[24:33.360 --> 24:38.600]  good short story most of stuff's plagiarized and the running man is set
[24:38.600 --> 24:42.160]  in the future where
[24:42.160 --> 24:47.520]  well in that film October is bonus recruitment might report a family member
[24:47.520 --> 24:52.360]  and get double credits put on your little digital card but if you're caught

[25:00.760 --> 25:04.880]  clips and put it together with what's really happening in Los Angeles in the
[25:04.880 --> 25:11.080]  year 2020 running man is now happening in 2020 here it is if you've observed

[34:51.040 --> 34:56.680]  facing this is a very important basic PowerPoint presentation is what you could
[34:56.680 --> 35:03.800]  call it PowerPoint 2.0 so this tracks the group we're fighting and if you don't
[35:03.800 --> 35:07.440]  know who you're fighting how are you going to win a war so it just went live
[35:07.440 --> 35:12.320]  it's a band-aid video everything we do is trademark copyright-free reposted
[35:12.320 --> 35:18.560]  change the name just get it out however you can ladies and gentlemen little tip
[35:18.560 --> 35:22.240]  is you should reupload it with my name in it some people find stuff that way
[35:22.240 --> 35:27.560]  other versions don't put info wars or Alex Jones on it and then it makes it
[35:27.560 --> 35:32.080]  pass the sensors that's why I work with sites and things that don't have my
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.520]  name or voice on them a lot of big sites you know and visit routinely we're
[35:35.520 --> 35:40.720]  behind it because you're behind us we're in this together but this video is a
[35:40.720 --> 35:44.800]  major action alert you know this stuff you do your own research you tune into
[35:44.800 --> 35:52.280]  the show people don't know this and they need to know that the guy telling them
[35:52.280 --> 35:55.400]  he wants to take their rights to save them is the same guy saying he wants to
[35:55.400 --> 36:00.040]  get rid of those very people so where does Bill Gates come from why is he
[36:00.040 --> 36:05.040]  suddenly the president of the world why is he the most important man in the new
[36:05.040 --> 36:08.080]  world order why is he more important than even Donald Trump when it comes to
[36:08.080 --> 36:13.920]  global power structure why is he calling the shots well he's got hundreds of
[36:13.920 --> 36:20.400]  years of money and power behind him his mother was recruited to bring him in to
[36:20.400 --> 36:24.680]  be an IBM frontman here it is
[36:27.440 --> 36:33.720]  nearly 2,400 years ago in ancient Greece Plato discussed the importance of
[36:33.720 --> 36:39.360]  population control Aristotle advocated the use of abortion and
[36:39.360 --> 36:46.680]  infanticide in 1798 an essay on the principle of population was written by
[36:46.680 --> 36:54.000]  Thomas Malthus he outlined the idea of positive checks which are diseases wars
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.040]  disasters famines and genocides Malthus believed that these things should be
[37:00.040 --> 37:05.040]  utilized to increase the death rate and believed that human misery was an
[37:05.040 --> 37:12.200]  absolute necessary consequence in 1859 Charles Darwin published the origin of
[37:12.200 --> 37:17.840]  species in it Darwin only hinted at the implications of human populations but
[37:17.840 --> 37:24.240]  his cousin Sir Francis Galton became obsessed with the idea in 1883 Galton
[37:24.240 --> 37:29.560]  published inquiries into human faculty and its development wherein he wrote that
[37:29.560 --> 37:34.280]  his intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that
[37:34.280 --> 37:40.480]  of the cultivation of race or as we might call it with eugenics the term
[37:40.480 --> 37:47.560]  comes from the Greek word eugenics of noble birth in the early 20th century
[37:47.560 --> 37:52.520]  eugenics became an academic discipline in universities organizations were
[37:52.520 --> 37:58.240]  formed and funded to win public support the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the
[37:58.240 --> 38:03.280]  Cold Spring Harbor Institute rejected the idea that all humans are born equal
[38:03.280 --> 38:08.800]  and began selling the idea of cultivating a new master race of noble
[38:08.800 --> 38:14.440]  bloodlines planned parenthood was formed in America by racial eugenics
[38:14.440 --> 38:21.240]  advocate Margaret Sanger president of IBM Thomas J. Watson established a
[38:21.240 --> 38:26.640]  special subsidiary in Poland called Watson business machines to assist in
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.440]  the Nazi invasion of Poland this business continued throughout the war and
[38:31.440 --> 38:37.440]  IBM managed the entire operation from their headquarters in New York during
[38:37.440 --> 38:43.000]  the Nuremberg trials the Nazis quoted US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.160]  Holmes in their own defense they claim that their eugenics program was being
[38:48.160 --> 38:53.360]  run from the United States the Nazis were rightly admonished for war crimes
[38:53.360 --> 38:59.120]  but not Thomas Watson he went on to create the IBM World Trade Corporation
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.280]  and passed IBM onto his son his granddaughter ended up marrying
[39:04.280 --> 39:09.840]  Margaret Sanger's grandson Bill Gates his father worked on the board for
[39:09.840 --> 39:14.920]  Planned Parenthood and his mother worked on the corporate board for IBM who
[39:14.920 --> 39:21.400]  Bill partnered with to create Microsoft with no medical background Bill Gates
[39:21.400 --> 39:25.720]  then went on to become the world's foremost pusher of vaccines and
[39:25.720 --> 39:33.280]  population control do you think this is all coincidence the Bill and Melinda
[39:33.280 --> 39:42.040]  Gates Foundation funds the WHO the NIH the CDC and the UN and now he is saying
[39:42.040 --> 39:47.720]  that until we get mass vaccinations we might never be able to gather in groups
[39:47.720 --> 39:53.060]  and which activities like mass gatherings may be in a certain sense more
[39:53.060 --> 39:59.840]  optional and so until you're widely vaccinated those may not come back at
[39:59.840 --> 40:05.160]  all the president's coronavirus response team are all pushing the Bill Gates
[40:05.160 --> 40:10.080]  vaccination agenda Dr. Fauci is on the leadership council for the Bill and
[40:10.080 --> 40:16.240]  Melinda Gates Foundation in January of 2017 Anthony Fauci told a crowd at
[40:16.240 --> 40:21.040]  Georgetown University that there would be a surprise outbreak during the Trump
[40:21.040 --> 40:26.080]  presidency there is no question that there will be a challenge the coming
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.680]  administration in the arena of infectious diseases both chronic infectious
[40:30.680 --> 40:34.760]  diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease and we have certainly a large
[40:34.760 --> 40:40.720]  burden of that but also there will be a surprise outbreak Deborah Birx is a
[40:40.720 --> 40:44.960]  board member for the Global Fund to fight AIDS tuberculosis and malaria
[40:44.960 --> 40:49.000]  which was founded by the Gates Foundation and known for millions of
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.080]  dollars of fraudulent misuse of funds in October of 2019 Bill Gates sponsored
[40:55.080 --> 41:03.400]  event 201 a simulation that estimated 65 million people killed by coronavirus in
[41:03.400 --> 41:08.800]  November of 2019 the Peer Bright Institute funded by Bill Gates was
[41:08.800 --> 41:17.560]  granted European patent number EP 317 2319 b1 for a coronavirus vaccine that
[41:17.560 --> 41:23.400]  may be used to treat humans today dr. Fauci says the virus will keep coming
[41:23.400 --> 41:28.520]  back and he says the ultimate game changer will be a new vaccine in
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.000]  Australia the prime minister is telling people the shutdown will last months
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.760]  that it's the new normal and that the only way out of your homes is to accept
[41:38.760 --> 41:45.520]  the vaccine there is no proof that vaccines are the answer in fact the CDC
[41:45.520 --> 41:49.120]  admitted in federal court that it does not have studies to support the claim
[41:49.120 --> 41:56.760]  that vaccines do not cause autism a top UN scientist admitted that vaccines are
[41:56.760 --> 42:02.560]  killing people it is time to do some hard thinking will you allow your
[42:02.560 --> 42:08.760]  government to impose forced vaccinations for info wars.com this is
[42:08.760 --> 42:18.680]  Greg Reese ladies and gentlemen Trump came out instead of vaccine that's
[42:18.680 --> 42:21.360]  hurry too fast could hurt people's a lot of vaccines hurt people well that's
[42:21.360 --> 42:26.560]  that's true now you have to understand that what I showed you is at the tip of
[42:26.560 --> 42:32.200]  the iceberg I told Greg Reese I said go look all this up IBM funding the
[42:32.200 --> 42:35.320]  family eugenics it goes even way deeper than what we just put that six minute
[42:35.320 --> 42:42.280]  report you understand this is a fact this is a fact so they're not trying to
[42:42.280 --> 42:47.080]  make it stronger they're trying to make us dumber to phase us out and they think
[42:47.080 --> 42:50.760]  you're so stupid that it's all hidden in plain view I hope for you and your
[42:50.760 --> 42:56.040]  family and the whole race is good you promote that video to everybody you know
[42:56.040 --> 43:03.120]  right now some time during the month of March in the year 2020 the nations of
[43:03.120 --> 43:09.600]  the planet began to slip permanently into a form of martial law a
[43:09.600 --> 43:18.000]  technocracy a control grid enforced by a medical tyranny aided by robots and
[43:18.000 --> 43:25.520]  drones overseeing the human population everyone was suspect everyone could be a
[43:25.520 --> 43:30.560]  carrier it didn't matter if it was the common cold that had been weaponized it
[43:30.560 --> 43:34.880]  didn't matter it came out of the Wuhan level four by a weapons lab it didn't
[43:34.880 --> 43:41.240]  matter a Bill Gates fingerprints were all over it the crime was so big that
[43:41.240 --> 43:46.200]  no one dared challenge the power structure and thousands of years of
[43:46.200 --> 43:51.680]  hard-fought basic jurisprudence and human rights disappeared in the twinkle
[43:51.680 --> 43:58.720]  of an eye and humanity slipped beneath the waves of the long dark winter my
[43:58.720 --> 44:04.520]  mind for more than eight weeks has been fixed constantly scanning constantly
[44:04.520 --> 44:09.320]  computing to understand the strategic attack we're witnessing we know by the
[44:09.320 --> 44:13.880]  scripting and the choreography and the fact that the virus has been scanned
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.800]  that it's man-made an attack on our economy the globalist media is firmly
[44:18.800 --> 44:23.080]  behind this devastating the United States and driving from from power but
[44:23.080 --> 44:27.720]  now we know from scores of studies from China the UK the United States of
[44:27.720 --> 44:34.440]  Europe Brazil Japan that the virus reinfects and attacks different parts
[44:34.440 --> 44:38.720]  of the body that ladies and gentlemen is an engineered bio weapon just as the
[44:38.720 --> 44:42.440]  Indian scientists eight weeks ago conclusively proves their major
[44:42.440 --> 44:48.600]  university they have a name for it the Pentagon it's called a soft kill weapon
[44:48.600 --> 44:53.040]  it doesn't kill you usually the first time but the next time the third time
[44:53.040 --> 44:59.280]  the fourth it does and it weighs down your economy in the process you have to
[44:59.280 --> 45:04.480]  look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and
[45:04.480 --> 45:10.280]  mainstream establishment media news sites to find it I did extensive searches
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.720]  online with different search engines I I did a bunch of research looking at
[45:14.720 --> 45:19.760]  different TV archives and I couldn't find hardly anything except a couple local
[45:19.760 --> 45:26.120]  news stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc zinc zinc the
[45:26.120 --> 45:32.520]  element on the periodic table that is essential to life and that is the most
[45:32.520 --> 45:38.600]  anti-viral natural compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies by
[45:38.600 --> 45:44.160]  the most prestigious universities including big studies on the coronavirus
[45:44.160 --> 45:51.600]  family so do yourself a favor search engine zinc and anti-viral three words
[45:51.600 --> 45:58.120]  zinc anti-viral zinc anti-viral do yourself a favor zinc anti-viral
[45:58.120 --> 46:04.800]  bio PQQ research that look into it for yourself big brother and the globalist
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.840]  don't want you to coq 10 oh you probably want to spend some time researching
[46:08.840 --> 46:16.000]  coq 10 and then research DNA Force Plus and the types that we have in here the
[46:16.000 --> 46:22.520]  very best forms of the PQQ and coq 10 and then a whole bunch of other natural
[46:22.520 --> 46:28.560]  ingredients for mother nature that are known to supercharge it all this is our
[46:28.560 --> 46:33.920]  best-selling overall for me and I've told listeners the end of last year that
[46:33.920 --> 46:39.360]  we can't sell products any more because there's not enough markup in them to
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.440]  find our operations but because of what's happening going on in the world
[46:43.440 --> 46:50.040]  right now I really want everybody has used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of
[46:50.040 --> 46:55.400]  DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus yourself and your family DNA Force Plus
[46:55.400 --> 46:59.240]  now 50% off
[46:59.240 --> 47:05.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:05.640 --> 47:28.280]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[47:28.280 --> 47:37.320]  there are a lot of people want to play god you see for the globalists their world government's just the beginning they want it in
[47:37.320 --> 47:43.360]  place to carry out what they call in their own words a technocracy to usher in
[47:43.360 --> 47:50.160]  the post human world they are funded directly by the British royal family
[47:50.160 --> 47:57.860]  and the entire IBM Microsoft fortune that was pledged upon Watson's death carry
[47:57.860 --> 48:06.120]  out the operations of Adolf Hitler that's why the left funds fake Nazi grips
[48:06.120 --> 48:10.920]  that run around and say ridiculous things that's the simulation the real
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.880]  thing is the group that created the Nazis now the left has taught in their
[48:16.880 --> 48:20.400]  universities not science not knowledge because they want a controllable idiot
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.120]  mass under them now they've gotten rid and and and sabotaged our educational
[48:24.120 --> 48:29.120]  system last hundred years really full control the last 50 and they produced a
[48:29.120 --> 48:34.040]  group of people like just small and others that go out and stage attacks on
[48:34.040 --> 48:38.480]  themselves to create racial and cultural division so everyone's divided and hates
[48:38.480 --> 48:44.960]  each other and so that whites finally outmatched overrun surrounded will turn
[48:44.960 --> 48:49.080]  towards the extermination plan but again the globalists are targeting whites as
[48:49.080 --> 48:54.480]  well it's a post human plan you've got to trick all the groups that each group's
[48:54.480 --> 48:58.220]  fighting for its own survival while you're setting up the AI anti-human
[48:58.220 --> 49:03.960]  takeover grip but white academics are taught that they have to pose as liberals
[49:03.960 --> 49:10.040]  to control and domesticate minorities to carry out your extermination and again
[49:10.040 --> 49:13.640]  they try to teach my dad that because he was top of his class when he was in
[49:13.640 --> 49:19.960]  UT as a high schooler in plan two and he said no thank you didn't sound too
[49:19.960 --> 49:23.760]  Christian to him but most people you get told you're part of the master group
[49:23.760 --> 49:27.680]  you're gonna be amazing you're gonna be of course it was a Jewish professor the
[49:27.680 --> 49:31.280]  head of the botany program who was running that plan two at the time that
[49:31.280 --> 49:35.600]  told my dad oh the Nazis were trying to you know just get certain groups we want
[49:35.600 --> 49:40.520]  to get everybody and then only have the elite of each racial group left on earth
[49:40.520 --> 49:44.400]  kind of like the moon raker type plan that Ian Fleming wrote about so that's
[49:44.400 --> 49:48.320]  the liberal version of Hitler the truth is they're just want total power and
[49:48.320 --> 49:51.800]  total control and it's completely psychotic and so that's why you're like
[49:51.800 --> 49:55.240]  well how's it a bunch of you know people of different races Chinese Jews
[49:55.240 --> 50:00.480]  Germans Dutch you know Spanish at the top of this it's just elite groups that
[50:00.480 --> 50:05.600]  are psychotics eugenics means royal or noble blood and all these groups believe
[50:05.600 --> 50:09.560]  they're the elites and so they're just setting up this horribly evil anti-human
[50:09.560 --> 50:14.200]  system while diving us down on purpose to play God so this video came out two
[50:14.200 --> 50:17.920]  days ago was aired everywhere I even saw it I don't watch a lot of mainline TV but
[50:17.920 --> 50:22.440]  I even saw it flip through channels CBS aired it a bunch of others aired it and
[50:22.440 --> 50:27.800]  they could go look on her Twitter and Facebook and see that it was her line
[50:27.800 --> 50:32.320]  she hadn't been a nurse for over a year but she said she was there and saw
[50:32.320 --> 50:37.440]  everyone dying and it's so terrible because she wants the virtue signal she
[50:37.440 --> 50:42.320]  wants to play a victim and then get attention which again is like air it's
[50:42.320 --> 50:47.920]  just it's just made up it's a mirage and because remember Maxine Waters said
[50:47.920 --> 50:53.320]  Jesse Smollett did a great job doing what he did to expose racism didn't
[50:53.320 --> 50:59.560]  matter if it was all fake didn't matter almost created a race war didn't matter
[50:59.560 --> 51:07.560]  how stupid it was you're supposed to believe what happened so CBS apparently
[51:07.560 --> 51:12.280]  refuses to properly vet information before assuming it to millions of people
[51:12.280 --> 51:16.200]  in attempt to make Donald Trump look bad last week by the outlet use footage of
[51:16.200 --> 51:20.640]  the worst-hit hospital in Italy claimed it was a video from New York Hospital now
[51:20.640 --> 51:24.920]  CBS is promoting a video of a crying ICU nurse claiming her hospital is
[51:24.920 --> 51:27.960]  experiencing a mass shortage and the nurses are forced to work in poor
[51:27.960 --> 51:32.640]  conditions now over the 24 hours it came out it was not real here's the fake
[51:32.640 --> 51:36.880]  footage
[51:36.880 --> 51:55.440]  I went into work and I was assigned to a COVID patient on an ICU unit that has
[51:55.440 --> 51:59.840]  been converted to a designated COVID unit
[51:59.840 --> 52:05.840]  not the nurses are wearing masks not even surgical masks in the hallways when
[52:05.840 --> 52:12.360]  they're giving report to each other I had my own N95 mask my manager I
[52:12.360 --> 52:34.200]  understand
[52:34.200 --> 52:39.080]  she's attacking Trump on her Twitter all fake they got nasty now they got the
[52:39.080 --> 52:42.520]  ventilators and doctors are saying actually ventilators aren't helping this
[52:42.520 --> 52:45.800]  is damage to the lungs being able to absorb oxygen it's on the issue of
[52:45.800 --> 52:49.560]  there being air in the lungs this isn't pneumonia but doesn't matter because
[52:49.560 --> 52:53.400]  though oh there's a shortage of those there's not one for every person so and
[52:53.400 --> 52:56.720]  coming back next hour they now admit in all the graphs even in New York the
[52:56.720 --> 53:01.880]  the acceleration has slowed down even Pete but they're trying to suppress that
[53:01.880 --> 53:08.480]  so we're gonna show you that and take your calls at 877-789 Alex 877-789
[53:08.480 --> 53:13.960]  2539 first-time callers in the first round and then long-time callers if you
[53:13.960 --> 53:16.440]  want after we load up the phones we'll be able to at least get to that first
[53:16.440 --> 53:24.280]  bank of callers 877-789 Alex 877-789 2539 on this subject on the economy on the
[53:24.280 --> 53:33.040]  world on where it's all going but if you want to talk about solutions to all of
[53:33.040 --> 53:38.560]  this it's what Jason Jones did three weeks ago he went to get tested because
[53:38.560 --> 53:41.400]  he'd been in LA flew back to where he lives in Hawaii had a bad cough said
[53:41.400 --> 53:44.840]  well I better get tested to see if I'm gonna people sick he just sees it on the
[53:44.840 --> 53:49.600]  news in this that the place is full there's lines by his house he drives
[53:49.600 --> 53:53.840]  down no one's there he goes up they won't test him he sees people over three
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.360]  hours come over nine people they won't test them now people done this all over
[53:58.360 --> 54:02.960]  the country doesn't mean there isn't COVID-19 but it means that there are all
[54:02.960 --> 54:06.960]  these groups getting your DNA doing weird stuff getting we don't know what's
[54:06.960 --> 54:10.560]  going on but all these hospitals they say all over the country that are full
[54:10.560 --> 54:14.680]  I've seen videos in Kentucky as well where this just happened and they go
[54:14.680 --> 54:17.880]  there and no one's there but the news standing there saying there's lines
[54:17.880 --> 54:23.720]  respirators death it's terrible world and then people go there and there's no
[54:23.720 --> 54:29.840]  one there and now they've got footage in New York other big hospitals where and
[54:29.840 --> 54:33.800]  a smoking gun where when the news media shows up there'll be like 10 people show
[54:33.800 --> 54:38.720]  up in masks and hoods who act like they're in line and are clearly workers
[54:38.720 --> 54:43.560]  so we now know why this happened we have the numbers we're gonna show you next
[54:43.560 --> 54:46.080]  hour but we go ahead to show some of those graphs Robert Barnes was showing
[54:46.080 --> 54:50.760]  last night and then show just the video of Colmo's press conference yesterday
[54:50.760 --> 54:55.480]  was about one o'clock central they covered on the war room yesterday they
[54:55.480 --> 55:00.960]  show the graphs on hospitalization on the infection on death and it's all
[55:00.960 --> 55:07.080]  going down it's either going down or the growth has gone down massively yeah go
[55:07.080 --> 55:11.360]  to the next video look at that they show you the old charts they showed then they
[55:11.360 --> 55:15.880]  show the real charts first what they predicted then what they said was gonna
[55:15.880 --> 55:21.280]  come and then when it goes to purple and then what it really is the purple so
[55:21.280 --> 55:25.240]  right around April 1st it peaked and it's now going down and they're having to
[55:25.240 --> 55:32.000]  admit this but it gets it doesn't get picked up so here is a city councilman
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.600]  David James in Louisville Kentucky District 6 where they're lucky to have
[55:35.600 --> 55:40.600]  him out there with some of the other folks going up to these people that are
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.120]  supposedly tested for COVID and when they realize it's a scam this is what
[55:44.120 --> 55:48.200]  happens this is this is how you stop evil you go out you check it yourself and
[55:48.200 --> 55:56.680]  most the time it's gonna be a lie here it is everybody man we listen we've done
[55:56.680 --> 56:00.800]  everything we can to make sure that not only we're employing the people right
[56:00.800 --> 56:05.120]  here in Louisville okay I've done many interviews many different things right
[56:05.120 --> 56:08.120]  out here we're doing things the right way we don't have anything to hide I
[56:08.120 --> 56:12.760]  even qualified to do testing here yeah that's what I thought y'all ain't got no
[56:12.760 --> 56:17.600]  answers to you see these are the people that are trying to take your own DNA do
[56:17.600 --> 56:25.120]  not allow them to are y'all doing where you from where you from where you come
[56:25.120 --> 56:36.040]  man oh your mama's house I got you how's your mama doing hey how's your mom
[56:36.040 --> 56:44.400]  and doing is your mama doing all right what are y'all doing are you trying to

[56:50.960 --> 56:54.120]  need mayors like that around here that are actually out doing something folks
[56:54.120 --> 56:57.040]  and it's the big hospitals running scams it's the little groups it's private
[56:57.040 --> 57:02.000]  groups it's Bill Gates up at the top scam scam scam scam scam scam and by the
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.520]  way I had top scientists on this show three or four of them telling you
[57:05.520 --> 57:09.120]  there's never been a vaccine for the common cold because there's thousands
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.880]  of mutations said they were the flu none of it works it's all a fraud and every
[57:12.880 --> 57:17.760]  study shows it lowers your immunity to the next flu well you take this cold
[57:17.760 --> 57:21.480]  virus vaccine it's gonna lower your immunity regular cold and by the way
[57:21.480 --> 57:25.720]  that's the big news why is everyone getting reinfected turns out in most
[57:25.720 --> 57:29.880]  tests they've been testing and saying regular cold virus that most people
[57:29.880 --> 57:38.240]  already have their body is COVID-19 yes it's unbelievable but the panic's real
[57:38.240 --> 57:44.720]  and the economy plunging's real but we're still on there fighting it stay
[57:44.720 --> 57:51.520]  with us our number two straight ahead it's incontrovertible humanity is dying
[57:51.520 --> 57:59.160]  every metric every gauge we have shows that we're living shorter lives we are
[57:59.160 --> 58:07.360]  diseased our IQs are plunging and we're ugly we're falling apart big pharma and
[58:07.360 --> 58:12.320]  the entire lovelest operation is a kill grid and the studies are clear the
[58:12.320 --> 58:19.520]  average person is in a dreamlike state a near dreamlike daydream world program of
[58:19.520 --> 58:25.480]  the flicker rates of the televisions and all the screens we are in a trance and
[58:25.480 --> 58:30.800]  now they're turning up the power of the ambient electromagnetic radiation which
[58:30.800 --> 58:36.920]  again all the studies conclusively show cause massive cancer and destroy your
[58:36.920 --> 58:42.040]  immune system and push viruses across the cell membrane we are being murdered
[58:42.040 --> 58:49.040]  and I've got to tell you it's very a sophisticated and looks not human listen
[58:49.040 --> 58:54.480]  to me very carefully we have confirmed that California is set within days or
[58:54.480 --> 58:59.360]  weeks to announce a total stay at home order and we'll shut down grocery
[58:59.360 --> 59:04.760]  stores and yes even pharmacies ladies and gentlemen this is what they're
[59:04.760 --> 59:09.200]  announcing to create total panic to try to trigger a depression to blame on
[59:09.200 --> 59:14.320]  Trump then when Trump doesn't all suit they will blame every single death on
[59:14.320 --> 59:20.920]  president Trump this is a Psyop using a real deadly virus this is super dangerous
[59:20.920 --> 59:27.000]  and everyone needs to get supplies in now the food chain is getting low as

[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:48.440]  missed what they said all right yeah there's this whole thing online where
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:51.960]  people think that folks are talking to my ear tell me what to say difference is
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:55.240]  they occasionally maybe twice an hour tell me something or tell me a clips
[1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:59.200]  ready but a lot of times it's real low a lot of times I say what what what clip
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:02.400]  is that or what'd you say and then there's just no response back maybe
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:06.320]  somebody had a mic open or something no big deal but we will be taking your
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:13.720]  phone calls coming up throughout this hour and then we are joined in the
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:20.560]  fourth hour by a very very special guest as well that I'll tell you about
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:27.560]  coming up at the start of the next segment as well but the biggest thing
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:36.240]  we need to know right now from my perspective is that this is absolutely
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:42.320]  100% the globalist power grab and their answer to human resistance and the
[1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:45.680]  awakening happening and their attempt to vertically integrate the economy to
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:49.080]  bankrupt the grassroots economy to bring in medical tyranny to bring in forced
[1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:55.360]  inoculation to ban cash and to have us accept absolutely no due process this is
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:02:00.600]  their move this is their world government attack system and it's really
[1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:10.040]  being done out of desperation but they could grab victory from the jaws of
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:18.360]  defeat if we don't speak out and if we don't go out and investigate and if we
[1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:26.160]  don't go out and see things for ourselves but what you have witnessed
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:32.920]  unfolding with citizens going out and and showing the scams and showing that
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:36.240]  no one's at the COVID testing sites and that the hospitals aren't full if
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:42.640]  they're having to show hospitals in in Italy in places that were is them
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:47.240]  trying to create as much hysteria as possible and so because someone's
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:53.360]  wearing a white outfit and wearing mask and says they're doing COVID-19 testing
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:57.800]  on you with this government in these groups histories of secret testing
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:03:01.120]  including lethal testing there are criminal groups hiding within the
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:07.120]  national security apparatus they use that national security grid they use that
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:13.640]  system to be able to carry things out by having the secrecy and it's it's under
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:19.800]  those rocks that these evil things hide and so the answer is don't put your
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:23.600]  faith in Alex Jones don't put your faith in Donald Trump put your faith in God
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:29.480]  and all of us working together to have an open free society where you go out and
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:34.240]  when you see something you videotape it and you give your angle on it and you
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:37.160]  talk about what you're witnessing so when you see the news saying everyone's
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:41.640]  dying or it's totally full and there's huge lines here and stretchers
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:45.000]  everywhere and they're not showing you that or they show it to you and it's
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:53.840]  another country I saw Fox News a week after CBS again got caught running the
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:04:00.140]  footage of Italy I saw Fox running footage of dummies and saying it was
[1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:02.840]  people being worked on and obviously it's stock footage the point is they
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:06.400]  don't have that footage and they were saying this is footage of people
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:10.680]  overwhelmed this is footage of people dying and I saw Fox News running the
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:17.320]  Italy footage again so this is going on and if I got caught I would ever do
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:22.720]  that anyways doing what they've been caught doing why would you ever listen
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:29.880]  to them again yeah and there's Fox News reporting on CBS mistake and I saw them
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:37.400]  on Fox Business doing it themselves and it's just out of control ladies and
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:42.040]  gentlemen it's out of control and it's dangerous all right your phone calls

[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:48.880]  there are citizens all over the world now going out to hospitals that they see
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:52.400]  on the news saying are full and that there's lines around the block and dead
[1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:58.880]  bodies everywhere and there's nobody there we're not saying this virus doesn't
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:03.560]  kill people we're not saying folks aren't dying we're saying they are
[1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:08.040]  exaggerating and hyping it and now the mayor of Los Angeles has declared
[1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:12.280]  martial law and said don't leave your house for any reason period was set to
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:15.840]  declare free from the grocery store of medicine and they're telling citizens

[1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:22.640]  the police this will create civil unrest and breakdown that's their plan to
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:26.280]  bring down the economy when Trump tries to reopen it in about a week or so he's
[1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:29.200]  got the commission going within three weeks it'll be totally open if he has
[1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:35.200]  his way Austria is reopening this week if we don't have a depression the curve
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:38.920]  has now begun to go down no one's reporting on that we have the graph from
[1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:48.680]  the CDC and New York will show you at the bottom of the hour as well and we had
[1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:51.440]  Trump talking about rushing a vaccine to kill a bunch of people that's what
[1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:54.240]  medical scientists are saying and we've got more microbiologists that are
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:57.920]  prestigious including at the Pentagon coming out and saying it's man-made
[1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:03.440]  Chimera bio weapon must be investigated who gave it to China and why China had
[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:07.880]  it and that's a Army Colonel microbiologist coming out saying that
[1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:14.360]  and others who's involved in bio warfare research defensively it's economy it's
[1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:17.960]  man-made it's sliced up a bunch of different pieces that's why it's so
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:25.480]  nasty and reinfects and we've got another big report here that they're
[1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:32.800]  trying to understand why after being re in after having it and then getting well
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:37.240]  from it why people are reinfecting and testing positive again for the live
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:41.440]  viral spread why are so many people that have recovered from the coronavirus
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:46.440]  testing positive again well that's because it mutates ladies and gentlemen
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:51.680]  but it's always a cocktail of reasons that when they test for it we have a
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:56.680]  medical doctor in Austin told Santa Hernandez this last Friday we aired it
[1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:03.880]  that the test pick up regular coronaviruses so between 30 and 60% of the
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:12.600]  time it's inaccurate and then you get locked up for the common cold see how
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:16.560]  it's the perfect weapon because it creates this fear makes us all suspect
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:20.800]  but the states here with the force inoculations to save us that's all
[1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:25.080]  coming up bottom of the hour let's go to your phone calls right now Tim Wayne

[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:06.760]  appreciation for the tremendous fight you've been putting up at info wars and
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:12.640]  I've supported you in every possible way I'm a lawyer in New York City in New
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:17.800]  York State and I am just shocked and flabbergasted every day at the lack of
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:22.800]  challenges these orders by the state governors are completely and totally
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:28.120]  unconstitutional lawyers in every state of the union that have these locked down
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:33.520]  orders the stopping of cause from out of state major provisions of the bill of
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:39.000]  rights the first the second the fourth amendment no searches and seizures there
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:44.320]  is no constitutional authority in the United States anywhere according to the
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:47.800]  federal Constitution and anything to the contrary in the states would be
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:54.840]  invalid for a general medical martial law no such thing absolutely
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:58.840]  unconstitutional they have deprived people of their businesses their
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:03.760]  livelihood their freedom and everything else the only way anything of this type
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:09.840]  can be done is the prosecutors on the state must go to a court they must get
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:14.400]  a judge to sign a warrants with probable cause and the evidence that
[1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:19.280]  specifically named people have these diseases and are doing things to
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:23.520]  endanger other people and that cannot do what they're doing now well that's
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:29.840]  right it's an avalanche it's a collapse of our entire system this is a blitzkrieg
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:38.520]  war a revolution against everything back to the Magna Carta 1215 800 years of
[1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:43.680]  people fighting millions and millions dying for basic human liberty that was
[1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:48.840]  taken from the kings by the people is now being torched in front of our eyes
[1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:53.840]  absolutely but the courts are still functioning as far as I know particularly
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:57.400]  the federal courts and with the constitutional questions there should
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:01.400]  be teams in every state and I'd be willing to join such a team here there's
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:05.240]  been a total blackout the only one I've heard talk about it are the few lawyers

[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:58.560]  a statement worthy of a fascist dictator there is absolutely no authority under
[1:13:58.560 --> 1:14:02.280]  the Constitution the common law and some of the other things that have been
[1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:08.320]  cited because it's it's it's really common sense under all the laws that we
[1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:12.400]  have under the laws that people have fought and died for in various different
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:17.440]  well world wars it put to protect our country and to have the revolution where
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:21.200]  they were where they were going into peace we didn't have these rights then

[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:04.560]  the world population under martial law being directed by the UN there is a
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:09.320]  massive awakening happening to the tyranny of big pharma and the medical
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:14.080]  mafia and the force denoculations of the UN admitting that vaccines are
[1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:18.640]  killing people and they've covered it up and everywhere I go I am just mob my
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:23.240]  folks on the street now even in leftist Austin who used to attack me just a few
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:29.160]  years ago saying you were right about 5g 5g's killing us I looked it up it's
[1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:33.600]  causing cancer it destroys immunity it says that it makes it easier for
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:39.640]  viruses to attack people are really starting to wake up and they know they're
[1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:45.520]  under attack at a spiritual and subconscious cellular level so now my
[1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:50.080]  friends educate everyone you know they're ready to listen they're ready to
[1:19:50.080 --> 1:19:56.280]  learn they're ready to take action I'm Alex Jones and this is the info war
[1:19:56.280 --> 1:20:03.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:12.280 --> 1:20:18.080]  but the social engineers don't want is the public talking to each other
[1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:23.840]  interfacing and checking things out when you see the local news say we're live
[1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:30.000]  here and this is happening get in your car and go see if it's true and a lot
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:35.600]  of the times it's not they have created an army of lying
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:42.360]  frauds they printed an army of criminals who believe it's okay to live the
[1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:47.600]  greater good bringing down America and the Nazi Donald Trump meanwhile they
[1:20:47.600 --> 1:20:53.400]  actually worked for a famous Nazi collaborator George Soros and the son
[1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:58.240]  of the man that ran Planned Parenthood and took over the eugenics society for
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:06.800]  Margaret Sanger his mother sat on the board of IBM Bill Gates these aren't
[1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:13.640]  Nazis these are the creatures who created the Nazis and they've got a plan
[1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:23.040]  for you or you don't exist all right let's go to West in Iowa paramedic on
[1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:26.480]  the virus of the medical system what are you really seeing out there and what
[1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:29.400]  do you think of all the videos of the news saying this hospital's full and the
[1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:33.440]  person goes there sometimes that hour and there's almost no one there what is
[1:21:33.440 --> 1:21:38.480]  going on well I can tell you the community I work my second child with
[1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:43.520]  one of the hospitals we are seeing people but our we have preparations in
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:49.880]  place one of the larger cities that we do go to quite often transporting
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:54.920]  patients and I do work in you know it's a typical day they are seeing a high
[1:21:54.920 --> 1:21:59.560]  volume of patients but we're not seeing a lot of of the COVID cases from what I
[1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:04.280]  understand as of yet but they do have preparations in place and they're
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:09.200]  ready for it but the thing about this is this disease is going to decimate our
[1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:15.040]  healthcare workers our first responders as well as our military and if you think
[1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:19.080]  about it if you're going to go after a country or their infrastructure what do
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:22.400]  you want to do first you want to take down their first responders you want to
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:28.560]  take out their military and this is the perfect weapon to do it well I've got an
[1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:33.000]  article US Army Colonel coronavirus was leaked from Chinese lab goes on to say
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.600]  it may be on purpose may not but that it's a chimera well we already know all
[1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:41.280]  that but the fact is now that's becoming an established fact that the people are
[1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:45.600]  understanding and now they're calling for investigations not just of China but
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:48.680]  who transferred this to them now none of these guys want to get into a
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:52.000]  trouble themselves it takes courage to do this but they're pointing towards the
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:56.720]  scientist article and others from 2015 where a gain of function chimera
[1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:04.400]  multiple virus species cut together artificial lab made was shipped to China
[1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:10.600]  it came from China but first it came from Obama in a US bio weapons lab this
[1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:15.960]  is a massive and you start exposing who's behind this the big foundations who
[1:23:15.960 --> 1:23:19.740]  are behind it they'll stop their takeover real fast but again the people
[1:23:19.740 --> 1:23:23.200]  getting the power from this low and behold again are the ones with their
[1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:26.640]  fingerprints all over at West
[1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:34.640]  zinc is one of the essential components for cardiac function the body your
[1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:38.640]  heart runs off the electrolyte to power the electrical conduction system that
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.600]  makes it be if you take too much electrolyte out of even just to help
[1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:47.320]  this drug does you're depleting these electrolytes in the heart and you're
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:50.920]  causing another problem to fix one problem especially if you're not giving
[1:23:50.920 --> 1:23:55.160]  people enough zinc and enough electrolytes to back it up so I think
[1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:59.080]  what we're seeing a lot of this and a lot of these that are actually caused by
[1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:02.120]  the medication that they're using trying to treat it because they're
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:08.240]  depleting them with their electrolytes try to treat this disease because like
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:12.360]  I said zinc helps the immune system and if your zinc depleted this drug pulls
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:18.600]  zinc out of cells anyway and including from the areas that the cardiac area
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:21.800]  so I'd really loved you're saying some amazing things but are you using a
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:28.520]  wireless Bluetooth system or what's going on there call me back when you get a
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:32.240]  better phone I appreciate it absolutely that's what the literature says that and
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:34.920]  some of the smartest folks will be the paramedics of the nurses because they
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:38.240]  do the real treatment on the ground in the emergency they learn how bodies
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:41.520]  operate they're they're really the ones you know doing a lot of the surgeries
[1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:45.360]  and things especially the nurses and they'll tell you the number one thing
[1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:51.680]  killing 35 year old marathon runners 18 year old basketball players and they'll
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:55.000]  fall over dead and it's still have a heart attack they go what's the syndrome
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:00.120]  where this young man is having a heart attack at 18 or this young woman's
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:04.880]  having a heart attack at 35 when you run out of the electrolytes like gasoline
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:11.200]  and engine it stops this is not rocket science and so many people are dying from
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:16.960]  lack of vitamins and minerals that's why everyone should take the real red pill
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:23.080]  or real red pill plus every day a strong multivitamin multimineral all of it's
[1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:29.440]  there with the preglonone that boosted all adult formula for children and
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:32.720]  adults we have a vitamin mineral fusion with the zinc everything but you need
[1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:35.760]  all of these and they don't want you to know that because they want the worst
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:40.600]  possible effect but I've been asking what is the side effects of hydroxychloroquine
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:46.680]  well if it's manipulating zinc in the body to pull it out and have it be in
[1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:50.240]  the basically the fluids of the body so that it's stopping the virus now it's
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.560]  not in the cells or whatever it can cause a problem so you need plenty of zinc
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:58.080]  in the body and you see when the news saying don't listen to talk show host
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:02.360]  the president has been so cowed by this that he'll be in the press conferences
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:07.840]  he'll go down I'm not being a doctor here I'm just saying that they're saying
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:13.520]  hydroxychloroquine helps and zinc and vitamin C and vitamin D3 and I mean
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:18.320]  it's like you shut up and then this woman gets up and goes you know you mean
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:24.680]  to China that you'll be me until China and he goes oh do you work for China she
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:31.320]  goes no no me not why China and we'll play that clip coming up and it turns out
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:38.040]  she works for a state-run government-controlled Phoenix television and
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:43.920]  it's not Phoenix in the great state of Arizona folks it's a chai-com run deal
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:52.520]  but the level of line oh I know where for China government no and again I'm
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:57.040]  politically incorrect on purpose folks I make fun of rednecks I make fun of
[1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:00.720]  everybody remember remember John Belushi famously being the samurai chopping of
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:06.240]  everything since when can't we do that no I'm gonna exercise my speech or lose
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:11.000]  it and what's not funny is communist China selling political distance organs
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:16.400]  have been three million Uighurs in forced labor camps and death camps but the
[1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:20.880]  left doesn't care about that they just don't want you to make fun of anybody's
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:24.960]  accent or make fun of the Chinese government like one of the poo the
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:28.840]  Chinese people think Xi Jinping talks that way the poo and I guess if you hear
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:33.160]  him talking kind of talk like we got pulled well they get executed if they
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:38.320]  do that so see I don't want to live in a country that's like that okay I got to
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:42.880]  two three calls so far that's not good when we come back I said I'd hit all
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:47.600]  that news I will hit the news and then I'm gonna go to your calls as fast as I
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.040]  can please do not forget ladies and gentlemen this broadcast is those are
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:56.040]  supported everything we sell we were selling before this crisis the media's
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:28:00.280]  like Jones is selling toothpaste with silver in it because of the crisis I
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:05.040]  know that's five years it's been out super blue is the precursor of super
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:08.400]  silver super silver is the tooth whitening toothpaste if you're talking
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:13.000]  about tea tree oil iodine and the same nano silver for something being
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:17.760]  antibacterial antiviral those all three are factually those on record is it a
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:21.400]  panacea for this virus no but what it's for it's for your teeth to make your
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:25.600]  guns healthier my dad's a dentist an oral surgeon he designed it with American
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:31.080]  biotech labs that's what it is but the media misrepresents what I sell things
[1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:35.200]  for and what I'm promoting things for it's insane but you're absolutely right
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.280]  I am brushing my teeth with the high-quality super blue that hasn't
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:42.880]  sold out yet the super silver has sold out this has the same amount of
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:47.120]  everything and more in it that the whitening doesn't it just doesn't have
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:51.960]  the above sea coral calcium for reminalization that's that's what this
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:56.000]  toothpaste doesn't have it has two things the others doesn't get healthy

[1:30:57.280 --> 1:31:05.160]  all of the hype is designed to destroy one thing confidence it's confidence in
[1:31:05.160 --> 1:31:09.840]  an economy confidence in a culture confidence in the direction the
[1:31:09.840 --> 1:31:14.680]  civilization and the people are going that causes people to work hard and

[1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:22.800]  entire culture and all these multinational governments in the UN the
[1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:30.160]  WHO and the Chai comms in Hollywood have been having orgasmic delight over how
[1:31:30.160 --> 1:31:36.480]  pliantly everyone has gotten into a state of fear yes the virus is real it's
[1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:40.920]  gonna be maybe double what the flu is normally and it's a bio weapon but a
[1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:45.880]  bio weapon the globalist in the trajectory of but it's real target is
[1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:50.720]  confidence in the economy and that's why recognizing that it's an attempt to

[1:33:06.720 --> 1:33:27.320]  welcome back to the info war on alex jones your host so the media jumped on
[1:33:27.320 --> 1:33:31.600]  trompe oh he was mean to that poor lady he said what do you work in China you
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:36.400]  work for the Chinese government she's oh no not stupid American and then of
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:40.800]  course enjoy your fentanyl haha enjoy your depression and it turns out she
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:45.640]  works directly for a group not just owned by the Chinese government and the
[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:52.720]  central bank of China but partly owned by the military of China so remember one
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:58.520]  American news has been banned from the White House press corps because a left
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:03.320]  this press private group controls it Trump made sure we got press passes every
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:06.920]  time we get there they would ban us because they're in control of the
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:11.560]  association from needs to change that so one American news is banned but the
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:15.680]  Chinese military is not and here they are with a striking distance of the
[1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:20.800]  president here it is years of five hundred billion dollars four hundred
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:25.480]  billion dollars we had the biggest trade deficits in the history of the world
[1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:32.960]  with China now China is going to spend a lot has agreed to spend 250 billion many
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:36.800]  billions of dollars in our country much of it going to farmers and
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:41.360]  manufacturers so I'll let you know I mean I I hope they're gonna honor the deal
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:47.280]  we'll find out are you cooperating with China who you working for China are you
[1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:53.000]  with a newspaper who you with Hong Kong Phoenix TV who was that China is it
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:57.280]  owned by China is it owned by the state no it's not it's a private loan the
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.240]  company okay good okay look I'll let you know I'll give you a good answer to that
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:05.680]  in a few months I wanted to see what they do because it's time for them to
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:14.240]  help us okay and hopefully they do and if they don't that's okay too but we
[1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:20.920]  signed a deal it was signed in with great good will and spirit and it's time
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:25.560]  that our farmers benefited our manufacturers benefited and we'll see
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:34.440]  whether or not that deal is on we send you weaponized violence you know I care you mean I
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:42.520]  sent fentanyl to get you if I don't get you I get your children I'm American
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:50.200]  sorry now let me get to some really good news but I was just getting a luscious
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:54.840]  cup of like American coffee literally during the break and I'm watching Fox
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:36:00.240]  and just yesterday they weren't reporting this but now they are reporting that all
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:04.000]  over the country and Robert Barnes cover this last night on the 7 to 9 special
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:09.320]  transmission American countdown that he does that's commercial light we have the
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:12.560]  local breaks for local radio and TV stations but we skip all ours so there's
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:15.840]  less than seven minutes of ads an hour and he was just showing hundreds of
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:20.840]  graphs and documents all over the country where not just the rise and speed is
[1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:25.560]  slowing but in many areas it's crested on April 1st strangely enough and it's
[1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:29.840]  going down so I'll show that Fox news clip in a moment on the stock market the
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:33.840]  economy on hopes that it's cresting which I think it is doesn't mean it might
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:36.880]  not reinfect or have some other spikes let's think about social distancing all
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:43.160]  this you just change the trajectory and it just you know but regardless let's go
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:47.440]  ahead now and go to Cuomo and then it goes into another clip from his press
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.040]  conference yesterday where they show that hospitalizations are down deaths are
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:56.480]  down rates of infections are down not just in the increase but overall and
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:00.080]  then they show a little purple graph of where we really are versus where they
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:03.880]  projected we would be if they didn't do this the other graph is where they thought
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:07.000]  they'd be but it turns out it's way lower they thought because they were
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:15.760]  hyping it up let's go to it total number of hospitalizations are down the ICU
[1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:20.680]  admissions are down and the daily intubations are down those are all good
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:26.960]  signs and again would suggest a possible flattening of the curve the
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:31.800]  number of discharge this down but that reflects the overall reduction in the
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:38.800]  numbers those were some of the earliest modeling from many organizations that it
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:43.840]  would be at the end of April around 110,000 beds just for COVID patients
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:49.440]  that's in New York other models to that we were tracking one being lower at about
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:57.400]  55,000 COVID beds but again peaking at the end of April we follow now that we
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:04.160]  have a pretty robust data set to go by for the last several weeks the bottom
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:08.920]  line there the purple line is sort of where we are tracking today which
[1:38:08.920 --> 1:38:14.760]  suggests it's a little lower and the question was what could you do to lower
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:20.720]  those initial projections from 110,000 and from 55,000 so a lot of the back it
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:25.200]  up 10 seconds why in the hell would you say a little lower that looked up both
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:28.040]  the graphs they had we're gonna show you some of the other graphs in a moment
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:32.040]  from the government the big high one is if you didn't totally do everything they
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:36.200]  said and jump out of the window if they ordered you to and then the next one
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:40.720]  was if you do what we say here's where it'll be and now I'm like oh this is what
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:45.680]  we actually have with real numbers and it's a little lower that's like saying my
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:51.640]  pinky is a little bit smaller than my leg no my pinky is a lot smaller than my
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:39:00.200]  leg it's like saying the number three is a lot lower than number 100 it's like
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:07.440]  saying ice is a little colder than fire but they want as much fear as possible
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:10.560]  that's why they did all this and they knew damn well the graph wasn't gonna be
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:15.760]  that high this is a nasty souped-up cold virus it'll probably kill more than the
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:18.960]  flu does every year now they got vaccines now they want to crush the
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:22.720]  economy that's the big issue people should be concerned the globalists aren't
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:27.400]  gonna stop here and most experts agree they keep the economy closed maybe three
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:31.760]  more weeks we're gonna come back for a decade I mean we're getting hammered to
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:37.680]  hell and now the CDC's numbers are out from the country and other sub areas and
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:40.640]  it's showing the same thing but California's just getting wrapped up
[1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:45.480]  saying you ain't leaving your house for medicine or to go to the store okay
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:49.960]  because they want to see how much you'll grovel and how much you'll tattle on
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:55.400]  your neighbors yeah look at some of these graphs right on April 1st starts
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:40:01.320]  going down and these are graphs put up with the government got hundreds of
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:06.280]  these damn things so that's where they told you it would be if you didn't do
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:10.920]  anything the the dotted line if you groveled give all your rights and then
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:17.880]  that's where it really is in the real world so your TV viewers are seeing all
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:20.380]  this your radio listeners will post this later from the live show
[1:40:20.380 --> 1:40:25.000]  dimplewars.com we have Barnes's show last night and other reports we did on
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:31.200]  I went for his war room showing that headline Cuomo says COVID-19 peaked
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:38.680]  April 1st now it may go back up but I mean stop markets up 600 points as we
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:42.840]  speak right now let's finish up with what the feller was saying and then we'll
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:49.160]  go to the Fox News Club go ahead but what could you do to lower those initial
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:55.480]  projections from 110,000 and from 55,000 so a lot of the activity was we saw
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:41:00.480]  where the statisticians and the folks looking at these types of models said
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:05.720]  it was going so what activities and actions could you take to aggressively
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:10.120]  lower that overall number and the answer really was and what the government has
[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:14.520]  been doing was aggressively enforce and enact social distancing to lower the
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:19.120]  overall number and this number and the current data suggests that that is
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:24.600]  exactly what's happening and it's not settled yet because we are going day by
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:30.040]  day and the numbers as the governor says has changed a lot over the time based
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:37.440]  on what numbers come in but this could suggest that we are indeed potentially
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:43.400]  at the apex or beginning to be at the apex at this moment like the governor
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:48.280]  said there's been a range of models seven days 14 days 21 days 30 days it
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:53.600]  looks like we're at towards the earlier side of that time frame based on the
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:56.840]  current projections and modeling that we've been looking at popular
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:00.680]  governments are already reopening like Austria ones that aren't popular is
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:03.480]  saying we're never reopening your way of life is over
[1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:07.280]  tattle on your neighbors but the illegal aliens will run around all these
[1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:10.080]  articles about illegal aliens are heroes and they're the ones that brave it all
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:13.680]  and farm workers are caught between coronavirus fears and feeding the nation
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:18.200]  we are very worried farm workers most of them become essential during pandemic
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:21.560]  you know just just again nothing is the poor farm workers but it's just all this
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:24.960]  crap the globalists don't care about your health they want power they want force
[1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:29.440]  inoculation they want tyranny all right I'm going fast when we come back to these

[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:55.720]  keep fighting Alex you're gladiator
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:05.640]  listen there's a show from PBS called it's okay to be smart so everyone who's
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:12.360]  been smart and has been put down for it and persecuted it's okay to finally be
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:17.320]  smart that's right there's not two sexes and and families are bad and the right
[1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:20.840]  thing to do is to sterilize your son so he doesn't become an evil warmonger I
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:23.320]  mean a lot of feminists are saying we should have the government passed laws
[1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:27.120]  that mail embryos that count but what's better and more reformed and more
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:30.760]  humanitarian is just to convince them when they're five years old and their
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:34.720]  testicles chopped off and again global warming is real we gotta pay Lord Roth
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:38.160]  child all of our money and the pandemics all really gotta be locked up in our
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:42.400]  houses we gotta use the language the universities say we're not a culture
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:47.640]  anything no no we're not we're good people we're good people that went to
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:52.560]  these corporate systems that didn't brainwash us no no they enlightened us
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:58.080]  how to censor and how to rule and out of control some time during the month of
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:05.720]  March in the year 2020 the nations of the planet began to slip permanently into
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:13.080]  a form of martial law a technocracy a control grid enforced by a medical
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:21.080]  tyranny aided by robots and drones overseeing the human population
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:26.880]  everyone was suspect everyone could be a carrier it didn't matter if it was the
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:31.280]  common cold that have been weaponized it didn't matter it came out of the Wuhan
[1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:35.920]  level four by a weapons lab it didn't matter a Bill Gates fingerprints were
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:42.640]  all over it the crime was so big that no one dared challenge the power structure
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:48.800]  and thousands of years of hard-fought basic jurisprudence and human rights
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:54.520]  disappeared in the twinkle of an eye and humanity slipped beneath the waves of the
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:47:03.880]  long dark winter you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:31.960]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones Thomas Jefferson said
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:35.120]  that all right let's get to at least five calls this segment I want to hear all
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:40.960]  these callers let's go ahead and talk to John in New Jersey says he works for
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:47.240]  Pfizer lay it on his brother if people let government decide which foods they
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:52.200]  eat and medicines they take their bodies will soon be in a sorry state as their
[1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:57.680]  souls of those who live under charity Thomas Jefferson those who will for
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:02.880]  ignorant act as the soldiers on which to prop up tyrannical giants seeking to
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:08.040]  destroy liberty don't deserve the rights and privileges she provides to them now
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:12.520]  Alex God bless you I know you've got a brother I got interrupt you we didn't
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:16.320]  pre-plan that I didn't know you were going to quote Thomas Jefferson when I
[1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:20.480]  just quoted Thomas Jefferson that was amazing that's serendipity synchronicity
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:25.680]  brother that's the Holy Spirit and man I'm feeling it right now I don't know
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:29.320]  about you but listen I've got a lot of things to say and not a lot of time
[1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:34.280]  let's go ahead I would love nothing more to sit down for a few hours and and
[1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:41.320]  talk with you over a cigar and a glass of whiskey but I'm a 25 year old I work
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:55.080]  please don't tempt me oh here we go don't get me going so we're in this
[1:48:55.080 --> 1:49:00.680]  situation for a number of reasons so liberty is a delicate area force of
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:05.800]  government liberty brings freedom and it brings abundance and and people need to
[1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:10.320]  know that and flushing it down the toilet brings North Korea exactly and it
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:15.400]  brings complacency and with it apathy now apathy is always going to bring
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:20.280]  dependency and then dependency brings bondage and that is where we are at and
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:23.800]  here's another thing we have forgotten the command of chance command
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:28.920]  the command change which we as humanity need to follow God created man man
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:33.520]  created the Constitution Constitution created government government is God
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:36.760]  you're a slave and that's where our system is different so they want to make
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:40.320]  the state God you're absolutely right what's what's your take on the virus and
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.760]  vaccines with everything you're saying is you're dead over the target on about
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:50.240]  90% of things you say Alex and I listen to you every day I buy your products and
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:53.720]  man I would love to work for you guys I'm sick and tired of working at
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:58.040]  pharmaceuticals I just graduated from school and I'm just like I'm fed up with
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:01.680]  with what I'm seeing but what's your what's your inside of you take on it
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:08.120]  here's what's going on is we get briefed now now from watching the event 201 I
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:12.200]  watched all the videos I analyzed them all the only representative at the event
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:16.440]  201 was Johnson and Johnson who is being who's the lackey right now in the
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:20.080]  media being pushed for the leader for the vaccine Johnson and Johnson now
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:23.880]  five years in on this as well because we just got briefed we have lectures and
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:29.360]  our research teams get briefed we are being given the the the upper level
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:32.840]  research is coming in funded by the Bill and Gates Bill and Linda Gates
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:36.480]  Foundation is going to be implemented at Pfizer and then our clinical teams are
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:40.480]  going to be testing the vaccine in the coming month so we aren't even the
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:44.840]  vaccine isn't even being developed at five it's being developed externally it's
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:47.720]  being given to the back to the pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer
[1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:51.480]  Johnson and Johnson is already on the ball because Johnson and Johnson they've
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:55.560]  been chosen to carry out this one and be the leaders in it more will be coming
[1:50:55.560 --> 1:50:59.760]  so that's what you need to understand you know you know you know what's going
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:03.560]  on but did you see the report that said that just went up where Bill Gates is
[1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:07.480]  running the whole show yes it's a brilliant report out and you're right
[1:51:07.480 --> 1:51:12.400]  over the target I know this is a no we're not just accusing Gates of
[1:51:12.400 --> 1:51:18.080]  something he's not doing he runs it all Bill Gates is in charge of that there's
[1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:21.200]  many people in charge of many components of this but he's the head on
[1:51:21.200 --> 1:51:26.000]  he's the head honcho of the vaccine part he's not the head honcho the whole
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:29.360]  thing I just agree with you on that if that's what you believe well no but I
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:32.600]  mean the whole thing is eugenics base but we absolutely he's heading up a
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:37.120]  vaccine I'm just saying the level he is he's the he's the head science officer
[1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:39.840]  of the New World Order obviously the Rockschilds and folks are the head
[1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:46.520]  honchos but yeah yeah you're right over the target but I said of this
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:50.520]  operation of everything you're seeing he is the general the field Marshall
[1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:54.560]  running it now here I got a warning a couple warnings I want to I want to
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:58.240]  bring to your attention now the caller the first caller you took the
[1:51:58.240 --> 1:52:02.200]  attorney brilliant man you should definitely get him on he he brought up

[1:52:06.760 --> 1:52:11.240]  which you put on he wants to infringe on our fourth amendment right and he knows
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:14.480]  they can't do it the New World Order knows that we have the so they want to
[1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:18.080]  trick us through bullying and to do it we're starting the podcast show and we're
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:21.520]  starting the weekend shows where we call back select callers to be honest

[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:42.360]  minutes seven minutes because he was making really good points we have amazing
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:48.920]  callers I want to get everybody here let's go to Jordan in New Orleans go
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:59.400]  ahead Jordan hey Alex go ahead welcome hey I want to say that I'm here in around
[1:52:59.400 --> 1:53:07.920]  New Orleans we've got mayor the toy control the first female mayor and you
[1:53:07.920 --> 1:53:10.920]  know they never had the sewage and waterboard working properly the pumps
[1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:16.560]  working properly in New Orleans and now she's blaming Trump because he didn't
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:23.480]  act quickly enough to enforce the shutdown orders to stop Mardi Gras
[1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:30.200]  and it's it's ridiculous well you but here's the trap Democrats wanted to
[1:53:30.200 --> 1:53:33.520]  incubate it they're ordered not to make a big deal about it they try to get the
[1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:37.440]  chai comms in to spread it because it is real is killing some people Trump
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:40.960]  actually tries to block the flights they try to block it and then when it
[1:53:40.960 --> 1:53:43.640]  spreads they blame them but that's kind of a trap then saying they didn't do
[1:53:43.640 --> 1:53:47.840]  enough people are always gonna die of the flu and stuff and a flu viruses we
[1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:52.400]  cannot end up cold viruses we cannot shut down because of this or they'll
[1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:56.240]  launch real bio attacks on us and we'll be done I mean this thing is weak
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:53:59.760]  compared to the stuff they've got and I'm not saying it's not a problem for
[1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:03.960]  first responders or others but you're absolutely right about how the Democrats
[1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:08.000]  Pelosi all of them said don't have a lockdown when Trump was trying to have
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:11.240]  limited restrictions that would have stopped it they wanted it to get worse
[1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:16.160]  so they'd have the massive restrictions yeah it's the same it's the same thing
[1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:20.480]  as Nancy Pelosi going hug somebody whatever you know here let's keep
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:25.000]  New Orleans open we can't control the city we have you know streets that you

[1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:52.640]  ahead hey Alex been a long time Lester since 2009 brother thank you sir there
[1:54:52.640 --> 1:54:56.640]  is a video on YouTube that was shot 10 miles from my house in Pensacola past
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:01.560]  where some boaters pulled up on the beach and if you want to see what tenure
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:05.800]  looks like and just how close we are to a hot war watch that video the second
[1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:08.480]  thing was I want to see it tell me the name of the video we'll pull it up right
[1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:14.120]  now coronavirus just following orders coronavirus just following orders click
[1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:20.240]  this week for the search on YouTube on YouTube sir yes sir and we got a few
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:24.920]  minutes tell us what happens well it's only three minutes long if they the game
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:28.040]  warden pulls up on the beach and they start harassing people because their
[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:32.840]  feet are on the sand and not in the water and it's just pure tyranny the
[1:55:32.840 --> 1:55:35.920]  second thing I wanted to ask you was your opinion on do you think this
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:41.720]  coronavirus is going to cause any more birth defects than we already have that's
[1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:46.680]  a really smart question here's the thing about a man-made weapon it's a
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:52.040]  chimera it's at least four viruses and it does reinfect and it does attack the
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:56.640]  testicles of course and Bill Gates his fingerprints are all over he wants his
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:01.240]  fertility so absolutely if something attacks the testicles and does a bunch
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:04.720]  of damage to the production of sperm you're damn right it's going to cause
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:07.720]  birth defects and that's that's that just goes without saying I think you're
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:13.040]  right yeah I wanted your opinion on that well everything they do I mean the
[1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:16.600]  Gardasil shot in the trials was sterilizing and reducing fertility in
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:20.200]  women so of course I mean of course they try to make it mandatory these are
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:24.520]  evil monsters brother where do you see this headed the next 30 days Alice
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:32.440]  because it if it does go hot and the president I love goes against us what
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:36.240]  I mean what what's gonna happen here well that's right they want to use it's
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:40.640]  not Trump notice he tried to tap it down do reasonable restrictions up front then
[1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:44.000]  they want him California is gonna totally keep locking down and then say
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:47.320]  that it's Trump's fault when when when he tries to open the country and the
[1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:50.840]  bureaucrats and the companies and the states and the blue cities are just
[1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:54.160]  gonna refuse to reopen for months and months and they're gonna get rid of
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:59.960]  dr. Fauci or whatever his name is that is the most well plant planted person you
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:03.320]  know I mean doesn't he see what this guy see how that works though as they
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:06.880]  snuck him in on him now Trump knows he's bad was about to fire him so Fauci
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:10.400]  stopped the open backstabbing and that now Trump fires him it looks like oh
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:14.120]  Trump got rid of the scientists but yeah little sneaky Fauci said Trump will be
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:17.360]  faced with a bio attack search snickering and laughing and licking his
[1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:24.280]  little goblin lips he is a he is a creature one grant he got was 100
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:28.360]  million four bill on the gates he's it he's involved in everything you're
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:31.400]  absolutely right great points kidding and I'm gonna ask listeners again it's a

[1:58:52.920 --> 1:58:57.600]  is not destroyed it is simply transferred into another form well we're
[1:58:57.600 --> 1:59:01.040]  seeing that happen right now the globalists are openly trying to hype of
[1:59:01.040 --> 1:59:04.600]  the coronavirus trying to kill our economy and trying to have martial law
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:08.880]  shut down around the country and trying to stampede Trump into implementing it
[1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:13.400]  so they can blame the imploding economy on him but Trump has seen through it and
[1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:17.640]  so he's let them implement the draconian controls and is saying do you really want
[1:59:17.640 --> 1:59:21.480]  a depression for something that's killed far less than the flu ladies and
[1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:25.800]  gentlemen now is the fight of our lives and the good news is their attack on
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:29.840]  humanity and on independent media has caused a lot of people to start thinking
[1:59:29.840 --> 1:59:34.880]  for themselves and so the traffic to info wars.com and bandot video is triple
[1:59:34.880 --> 1:59:39.520]  our previous records right now so you're doing a great job spreading the word
[1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:43.480]  and people are tuning in to find out the truth like never before because of you
[1:59:43.480 --> 1:59:46.600]  the modern Paul Revere's
[1:59:46.600 --> 2:00:06.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:06.400 --> 2:00:10.240]  well real air raid sirens being played around the country major mayors are
[2:00:10.240 --> 2:00:14.120]  saying arrest anyone that leaves their homes they'll pay neighbors to sitch on
[2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:18.880]  you print the illusion that runner martial law were not Jim Hoffs been
[2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:23.640]  vindicated so far as the curve begins to break way lower than what they said
[2:00:23.640 --> 2:00:27.160]  he'll be joining us for a few segments will continue on with your calls but
[2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:32.680]  right now we're going to calls let's talk to who's been holding the longest
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:41.040]  here hmm let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Georgia Chris what is the next
[2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:46.640]  phase after this pandemic Alex Jones what's up man this is Chris I've been
[2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:50.960]  listening to you for over 10 years so thanks for taking my call I wanted to
[2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:55.720]  first of all I wanted to say I've been on your product since 09 and man they're
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:00:59.880]  a game changer because not only do they provide benefits for you but they also
[2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:03.200]  change your mindset to hey I want to live healthier I want to eat healthier I
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:07.000]  want to take care of myself better and it's been a life changer for me so thank
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:11.280]  you for all your products thank you brother yes sir hey now so that's my
[2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:14.720]  question is I know you're always forward-thinking what is the next phase
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:17.960]  because I think to me this seems like just a test because like you said it's
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:21.720]  not near as powerful as some of the things they have in some of these uh
[2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:29.080]  biosafety level for labs what what is the next level because every time they
[2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:32.280]  get done what they got done with their impeachment now this comes in it's been
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:35.320]  since Trump's been the president I think he's been so successful devastating
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:38.960]  the economy and Americans on average have been so pliant and Americans that
[2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:42.360]  aren't pliant haven't been vocal enough that the chikoms the deep state will now
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:47.040]  launch a more dangerous a more deadly bio attack because they found the weak
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:51.440]  spot they took the big guns out with this now they've got bio weapons experts
[2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:55.240]  army colonels coming out saying clearly the chikoms probably launched this we
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:59.560]  know it's man-made they definitely leaked it they're certainly using it and the
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:03.560]  media is certainly hyping it so you're seeing that America is literally under
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:07.160]  attacks I would say they'll keep doing more of this the Russian gate the
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:12.560]  Ukraine gate the race war garbage the Trump's a rapist of BS didn't work and
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:18.200]  so they'll keep targeting the economy and they'll have election fraud that's
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:22.960]  why Kentucky governor said they're gonna let folks vote without IDs and that's
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:25.440]  happening Democrats are doing this all over the country so I think that's what's
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:30.000]  coming next to Chris yeah yeah and I see that I see that you know immediately
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:33.680]  once it starts coming out they said oh let's have the election by mail they're
[2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:36.840]  going I think there's there's some definite election fraud in the way
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:41.760]  this helps every agenda they want my friend awesome man thanks for taking my
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:45.240]  call press you are awesome for calling God bless you you're the reason we're
[2:02:45.240 --> 2:02:51.000]  here so understand you know that you're the folks that run the show here all
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.280]  right let's talk to Christine in California got about two minutes with her
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:58.440]  before Jim Hoff what do you think's happening Christina from California
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:03.720]  well hi I've been a long-term with their off and on of yours I agree with most
[2:03:03.720 --> 2:03:09.960]  of your stuff the constitutionality of what's going on is kind of mixed in the
[2:03:09.960 --> 2:03:14.280]  section that says that habeas corpus shall not be suspended accepting case of
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:19.800]  war insurrection because the public safety is at issue the public safety is
[2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:23.760]  right there entrenched in the Constitution as an issue now the
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:27.720]  health department is not enforcing criminal law but civil and health codes
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:32.280]  therefore it's been determined a long time ago they don't need a warrant though
[2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:37.280]  in many cases they may need to give prior notice of inspection so what is
[2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:42.120]  going on here is not inherently unconstitutional but public safety is
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:46.520]  an issue and when you overdo it and endanger the public safety they're
[2:03:46.520 --> 2:03:50.520]  overdoing it that could be the very issue that does make this lockdown
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:54.160]  well yeah we have a total depression millions will starve to death and will
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:58.600]  be a war yeah yeah exactly I mean they're stalling the economy is the
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:03.120]  guaranteed biggest health disaster you'll ever see the second thing is I have a
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:09.080]  question for you you mentioned the years ago you knew all these people attended
[2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:15.840]  parties rituals etc did you ever hear of an altar being in use that was a slab
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:22.880]  stone on the ground not elevated ankle high to a man's ankle about you know
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:28.400]  real thick real heavy has to be lifted by four guys usually has grooves on it I
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:31.600]  guess to catch the black Christina if you'll hold because Hofstra got a few
[2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:34.760]  segments with us and I'll come back to you I wasn't in a bunch of rituals I
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:38.480]  knew rich people that were the occult growing up in Dallas then I snuck into
[2:04:38.480 --> 2:04:41.960]  Bohemian Grove I knew some Hollywood folks but I want to be clear I'm not
[2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:46.560]  been running around you know engaged in rituals I mean I did I did have sex with
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:50.400]  Satanist sex operatives I mean I've had I've had sex with Satanist trying to
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:55.640]  recruit but I'm not dead in Satanism we're right back listen to me very
[2:04:55.640 --> 2:05:00.600]  carefully we have confirmed that California is set within days or weeks
[2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:05.920]  to announce a total stay at home order and we'll shut down grocery stores and
[2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:11.280]  yes even pharmacies ladies and gentlemen this is what they're announcing to
[2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:16.360]  create total panic to try to trigger a depression to blame on Trump then when
[2:05:16.360 --> 2:05:21.480]  Trump doesn't fall astute they will blame every single death on President
[2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:27.000]  Trump this is a Psyop using a real deadly virus this is super dangerous and
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:33.280]  everyone needs to get supplies in now the food chain is getting low as well
[2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:38.840]  and you need to get the supplements just to be safe at info or store.com and
[2:05:38.840 --> 2:05:42.400]  stock up because who knows the future it will even be able to operate we're
[2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:45.680]  ready to ship to you though the day after you get your order in it you see a
[2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:49.440]  very very quick info wars is an essential operation is still open you
[2:05:49.440 --> 2:06:17.360]  can also order storeable food again but take action now at infowarsstore.com
[2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:35.360]  we're all in this together yeah right and then of course we have air raid
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:40.160]  sirens with the police driving around with them Jim hoff joins us after he
[2:06:40.160 --> 2:06:43.400]  leaves in about 20 30 minutes we're gonna go back to your calls and Paul
[2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:47.440]  Watson is loaded forbearance always posting the fourth hour today they've
[2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:50.640]  got the war room three six then we'll rear an hour of my show and then Robert
[2:06:50.640 --> 2:06:55.320]  Barnes will begin with American Countdown and that is from seven to nine
[2:06:55.320 --> 2:06:58.720]  live and they take your calls no special guest I'm totally a big guest
[2:06:58.720 --> 2:07:04.640]  tonight Jim hoff to gateway punnet.com and he has been chronicling this very
[2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:07.840]  accurately I'm not gonna rear it because of time constraints but we played it
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:12.560]  twice today we can show the graphs of Cuomo yesterday saying essentially it
[2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:16.600]  looks like they've gone over the top not just crested in hospitalizations deaths
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:19.920]  and the rest of it looks like it started about April 1st making this the April
[2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:24.040]  fools thing they're gonna claim victory that lockdown made this happen there may
[2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:29.040]  be new infections but Jim hoff has been saying this was overhyped from the
[2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:32.560]  beginning you know I think it's always safe to be safe but clearly the
[2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:36.880]  Democrats want this to be bad to shut the economy down they admit that they're
[2:07:36.880 --> 2:07:40.680]  set to try to keep California shut for months and months and months they're
[2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:45.240]  announcing to try to hold the country hostage so Jim hoff has been very
[2:07:45.240 --> 2:07:48.360]  prescient in this with his sources around the world so I wanted to give him
[2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:51.840]  the floor the next two segments to see what he thinks is coming next Jim thanks
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:57.360]  for joining us a great be with you Alex good to be back well where do you want
[2:07:57.360 --> 2:08:00.080]  to start I mean you're being vindicated right now I mean I hope that it
[2:08:00.080 --> 2:08:03.000]  continues to go down they're just saying that they did this because they shut
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:06.040]  things down but it's way lower than what they said it would be if we had a
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:11.360]  lockdown right you know what's amazing Alex is they've gone from one to two
[2:08:11.360 --> 2:08:17.040]  million projected deaths that was about nine days ago and then they went to
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:23.760]  100,000 to 200,000 projected US deaths that was about eight days ago and then
[2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:27.920]  over the weekend these these are the same people they're using their model for
[2:08:27.920 --> 2:08:32.920]  to shut down our economy over the weekend then on Sunday night after their
[2:08:32.920 --> 2:08:40.120]  other projections blew up on them they they projected now that it's 80,000 US
[2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:46.320]  deaths from this coronavirus so they continue to keep you know switching
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:51.760]  these projections and going lower and lower and lower and in fact I looked at
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:57.440]  the numbers today and if you look at the what they projected even since they
[2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:01.840]  since they altered their numbers on Sunday they're already off by another
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:08.280]  20% they've overhyped it by another 20% since Sunday so they're gonna have to
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:13.680]  lower this again if we don't see these trend lines starting to change it's
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:18.560]  it's really amazing and and Alex I don't know if you shared this on your show or
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:24.080]  not but last week when they switched their numbers from two million projected
[2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:30.720]  deaths down to 200,000 you know a factor of 10 when they did that that Dr. Berks
[2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:36.120]  went in front of the nation and said it's wonderful all you guys did it you
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:40.000]  stayed at home you're doing social distancing and that's what brought us
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:46.400]  this you know tenfold reduction in our projections Alex they have no science
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:51.400]  behind that they have nothing that they can show us that prove that that's what
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:55.040]  brought these numbers well this is scripting like right out of Hollywood
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:10:01.320]  where they script themselves and cast themselves as the heroes oh absolutely so
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:05.520]  it doesn't matter what happens they're still gonna be the heroes and it's just
[2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:10.200]  you know so as you've been reporting as we've been reporting a gateway pundit
[2:10:10.200 --> 2:10:15.320]  we've already seen 10 million people without jobs that number is growing by
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:21.040]  the week and these people are as you said you know what is their end game
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:25.480]  here when is this going to when are they gonna open up the economy again Dr.
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:29.600]  Fauci said last week that they're gonna wait till they have no deaths and no new
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:34.920]  cases and that's somewhere in what 2059 or something so it's insane what's
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:39.120]  going on I'm really glad that you're there to report on this you've got a
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:42.760]  lot of breaking stuff at gateway pundit.com I mean I'm actually envious
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:47.840]  over at M4's how much you break looking at it and all your sources I know you're
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:50.680]  close to the White House we've got some folks close as well Trump's not this is
[2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:54.120]  really blown and an attack on the economy for the beginning he tried to
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.480]  everybody to settle down but he knew the hysteria was so bad if he didn't go
[2:10:57.480 --> 2:11:00.960]  along with some of it they'd blame him for every death I think he's balanced
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:04.320]  this quite well but what's the feeling from your sources in the White House of
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:08.560]  what the president thinks and when he wants to try to reopen the economy well
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:12.160]  I can tell you one thing about the White House Alex as you know we used to
[2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:16.000]  have a reporter who was inside that White House and we're getting a lot of
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:22.360]  news lately that you know there was a reporter in there yesterday who works
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:27.760]  for this Phoenix channel that's owned by the Communist Chinese when we had a
[2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:32.080]  reporter in there he was treated like crap we see these reporters every day
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:38.120]  attacked this president and and yet they treat people like you like Gateway
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:45.000]  pundit like OAN as you know heretics OAN out who the president loves is because
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:50.520]  the president is surrounded by deep state trash all over the room and that's
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:54.040]  just how they treated our reporter when he was in there Lucian Wintrich a couple
[2:11:54.040 --> 2:11:58.440]  years ago they even physically attacked him you know this didn't get a lot of
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:02.400]  play but that was you know this is how they treat people in fact when I was in
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:07.320]  the White House press room and I was there with Lucian one time the
[2:12:07.320 --> 2:12:11.320]  Canadians were there Justin Trudeau was in town he was doing a presser with
[2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:16.000]  Donald Trump and the Canadian reporters said to Lucian and I they said hey you
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.800]  guys aren't you guys aren't from from here are you you're different than the
[2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:23.800]  rest they said because you guys are nice the rest of these reporters are just
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:30.160]  jerks I mean just really mean nasty people so that's what we have questioning
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:34.760]  this president every day trying to you know set him up trying to just one
[2:12:34.760 --> 2:12:40.120]  constant attack after another really just awful people in that room and I
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:43.800]  don't think you can overstate that when I've been around the Democrats in DC
[2:12:43.800 --> 2:12:47.720]  lining up to go to committee room they are literally the most villainous rat-
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:51.640]  like scumbags Oliver Darcy the personification and then they run around
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:55.600]  policing everyone a mere complaint by them and your band are thrown out of
[2:12:55.600 --> 2:12:59.680]  things just I don't like how he looked at me oh your royalness and then just
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:04.080]  throw you out right well we see that all the time how people get attacked just
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:07.880]  for being conservative and how the left is trying to ruin their careers and
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:12.880]  ruin their you know if they have a job somewhere they try to attack their
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:17.920]  their people who hire them it's you know this is who the left is of course Alex
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:22.320]  nobody's been more persecuted than you but um you know these these people are
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:25.680]  something else I was in a hearing a year and a half ago I know we're getting
[2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:31.040]  off topic but I was in a hearing with a Jared Nadler and a couple
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:34.520]  other of these Democrats and I swear to God Alex it felt like Satan walked in
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:39.480]  the room when that guy came in I felt this dark presence walked in the room
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:43.160]  oh you're not kidding the first time I felt that was around Hillary and then
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:47.080]  Janet Reno she looked at me and I'm not a person that's easily scared I had a
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:52.640]  chill go up me and it was it was you I probably felt the evil yeah well that's
[2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:56.880]  how I that's how it was for me absolutely so that's who that's who we're
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:00.680]  dealing with and you know this and I know this and not it's it's so we just
[2:14:00.680 --> 2:14:05.320]  got to do what we can to you know push forward and we're gonna go to break a
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:09.680]  segment coming up how do you think it's going for the deep state in the media
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:13.640]  hyping and I think yet again it's failing when I'm seeing at the grassroots
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:18.560]  and people are ready to reopen oh absolutely I think I think they are I'm
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:23.360]  in St. Louis Missouri that certainly we haven't seen the I think we had 18
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:27.560]  deaths in the whole state of Missouri right now people are wanting to go back
[2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:33.160]  to work but you know it's it's kind of frightening to Alex and it's a lot of
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:37.560]  these people just immediately just fell in line when they started doing all these
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:41.960]  restrictions on their freedoms and that's very concerning you know there's a
[2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:47.720]  we put up a story this morning again we put in Howard Hartford they had Hartford
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:51.800]  Connecticut they have a news station there promoting this app so that you can
[2:14:51.800 --> 2:14:57.160]  snitch on your neighbors if you see them breaking their social distancing so it's
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:01.760]  it's really just you know pure Marxism did you see where the mayor of LA said
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:06.680]  it's good to be a snitch report on your neighbors will give you money it sounds
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:09.640]  like something straight out of the Soviet Union something I used to read
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:14.320]  about as a kid and it's happening here within a month it's just shocking well
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:17.840]  I'll say this we've had a coming out of the left in the last five years they are
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:22.800]  just down-and-dirty authoritarians and and then I want to ask we come back why
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:25.240]  are they doing it why do they think it's gonna work maybe they're just
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:28.240]  conditioning us what do you think Trump should do what do you think could happen
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:33.360]  the election 209 days out will they cancel it all together how long will this

[2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:30.240]  like a bunch of hype and they keep lowering the projections doesn't mean
[2:20:30.240 --> 2:20:33.360]  we're not saying that there aren't dangerous viruses in the world but the
[2:20:33.360 --> 2:20:36.600]  idea you have a vaccine for the common cold they've never done it because it
[2:20:36.600 --> 2:20:41.160]  mutates too much same thing with the flu and so the fact that the media and the
[2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:44.920]  system are gonna do this it shows if this doesn't get rid of Trump because I
[2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:49.040]  don't think this is gonna work either what comes next what do they do next
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:54.480]  jim with all these Democrats you know nurses saying oh everybody's dying turns
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:57.720]  out it's fake I mean they don't ever seem to back down they just get crazier
[2:20:57.720 --> 2:21:03.200]  and crazier where does all this hysteria go yeah I dread to think what
[2:21:03.200 --> 2:21:08.440]  could come next Alex you know I do pray and I'm sure I'm one of your many
[2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:12.280]  listeners who prays for this president every day and for his safety because
[2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:16.760]  they've done so much to him to try to take this man down but they just
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:22.040]  haven't been able to do it this this wild virus that we're fighting now that
[2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:28.280]  doesn't seem to target any of the children any of the teens even people in
[2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:33.760]  their 20s and 30s are there they're not being hit by this I must tell you Alex
[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:38.960]  the story in a st. Louis news a couple well about a week ago was this 31 year
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:42.800]  old girl lost her life to this coronavirus of course that was big news
[2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:46.080]  and it was news all over the country well they finally put pictures of this
[2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:50.440]  girl out she was probably about 350 pounds so we're seeing that this is not
[2:21:50.440 --> 2:21:57.360]  attacking actually the healthy you know under 30 under 40 crowd it really weird
[2:21:57.360 --> 2:22:01.560]  virus usually they attack a lot of children die in the flu every year you
[2:22:01.560 --> 2:22:06.120]  know so it's it's a strange things that are happening but the media is doing
[2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:12.520]  everything they can to push this narrative that you know this is gonna
[2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:17.200]  wipe out the the whole country or it's gonna be like a Spanish flu where one
[2:22:17.200 --> 2:22:22.120]  in a hundred Americans were killed and we're just not seeing those numbers well
[2:22:22.120 --> 2:22:25.440]  we had a paramedic call in and he said look if you don't have a proper level
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:29.360]  of zinc you take hydroxychloroquine it can get your levels off and I'm on a
[2:22:29.360 --> 2:22:32.400]  doctor I'm telling the folks that that's what people got to be careful period a
[2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:35.560]  lot of these people that are young dying it turns out they had weird treatments
[2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:38.600]  like you said they already had cancer they already had heart problems it's
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:41.960]  it's incredible Jim I could ask a million questions and I've got them what
[2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:44.680]  else is front and center at Gateway Punnett's radar what else you want to
[2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:49.680]  talk about we know daily right now we're kind of updating the numbers and
[2:22:49.680 --> 2:22:53.520]  following that they're saying that the peak is gonna come you know by the 19
[2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:57.640]  and Alex you you put this up earlier we may have already hit the peak in
[2:22:57.640 --> 2:23:01.320]  America we're not really sure where it is right now but we do know that the
[2:23:01.320 --> 2:23:05.440]  numbers since they adjusted them on Sunday they're already 20% off and
[2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:09.600]  they're lower than the numbers that they brought way down that were you know
[2:23:09.600 --> 2:23:15.920]  listed on Sunday so not really sure where this goes I do know though that you
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:22.200]  know God help this president he's you know walking on a tight rope trying to
[2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:26.400]  balance the health of the you know the people in this country with the economy
[2:23:26.400 --> 2:23:30.720]  it's really an impossible task but I think if anybody can do it it will be
[2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:35.640]  Donald Trump well I've got to say having over a hundred crew members with the
[2:23:35.640 --> 2:23:39.440]  media operation we haven't been 46 and having four kids and experiencing things
[2:23:39.440 --> 2:23:45.760]  I see the insecure or or ignorant thing that young people say but also folks
[2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:48.840]  have never really run anything oh he should do this he should do that sir
[2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:53.120]  wave a wand do this wave a wand do that and then I know as a manager what
[2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:57.000]  Trump's going through but at a level 10,000 times harder that you see how
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:02.840]  nuanced and genius level he really is to be able to work so hard to continually
[2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:07.080]  be on the ball and to handle this I mean we just thank God we've got Trump and
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:11.560]  not so you imagine Joe Biden during this oh my gosh you wouldn't even know what
[2:24:11.560 --> 2:24:15.280]  the hell's going on you know it's it's really scary and the fact that he's
[2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:19.480]  trying to attack Trump now I think it's I think it's really amazing that I even
[2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:24.040]  saw this yesterday the Democrats want to start some sort of an investigation on
[2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:27.720]  Trump for all the mistakes he's made which have been zero oh yeah that was my
[2:24:27.720 --> 2:24:30.880]  next question they're the ones that bring it in they're the one set open the
[2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:34.600]  borders they're the ones that said let the Chinese fly in and now they're
[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:39.680]  starting a 9-11 commission with sorry go ahead yeah yeah they're the ones who
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:45.760]  have a lot of the plastic bags they're the ones who I you know have people
[2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:49.760]  living on the street and they think that that's okay so all these different
[2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:54.240]  Democrat plans are falling apart and yet now they want to blame Donald Trump I
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:57.960]  didn't notice yesterday though that one of these Democrats said yeah we want to
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:03.200]  start after you know after January and February and March right because that's
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:07.960]  because Donald Trump you know banned the flights from China at the end of
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:12.320]  January something no world leader would do Donald Trump was the first to do it
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:16.640]  that's what they even say exactly to tailor the investigation to after they
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:21.200]  said leave everything open and federal judges tried to keep Trump tied right
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:24.720]  right another thing that happened yesterday Alex for your listeners and
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:31.160]  viewers that Trump was asked about this you know so they tried to you know
[2:25:31.160 --> 2:25:36.040]  ambush him like they always do they asked him about this inspector general in
[2:25:36.040 --> 2:25:39.920]  the health and human services he didn't know who they were talking about it
[2:25:39.920 --> 2:25:44.160]  first so he asked a few questions he does this live Alex in front of the
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:49.760]  nation this man is so brilliant that he was able to ask the questions and by the
[2:25:49.760 --> 2:25:54.880]  end of that you know segment he was able to say yeah well this is a Obama hold
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:26:00.400]  over a deep-state hack there you have it and he does that live on national TV
[2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:04.520]  it's really remarkable what he's able to do I don't know if anybody would have
[2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:10.760]  you know the the intellect and the balls to do something like that live while
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:16.800]  they're being quite you can see him his brains resting like a like a super car
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:20.720]  engine and then as soon as he gets attacked you see the eyes open up the
[2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:25.640]  brain speeds up and he's got the answer it's incredible yeah he's a he's an
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:30.200]  incredible president and he's the only one who we would want to charge at this
[2:26:30.200 --> 2:26:35.240]  time because he's just done a remarkable job I've heard people say that even with
[2:26:35.240 --> 2:26:39.760]  this this plan they put forward to help businesses some business owners are
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:43.560]  already saying it was easy to fill out they had everything there all the
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:47.600]  questions that I would have they were already answered and they felt like they
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:51.320]  had an easy time applying for this business loan that's coming out right
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:57.080]  now so I you know even in that respect Trump hasn't covered and I like the fact
[2:26:57.080 --> 2:26:59.880]  that it's not just a big corporate bailout it's direct money and then it's
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:03.840]  forgiven us alone direct you're gonna helicopter money to restart the economy
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:06.360]  you got to do it directly to the people if you're gonna go down that road
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:12.800]  absolutely yeah it's a great plan and it's something you had to do and so you
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:16.080]  know what about the official conservative argument that well you know
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:20.160]  this is going down the road to inflation they're putting us in a depression by
[2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:24.520]  design this is kick-starting things to stop a depression I understand that you
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:28.840]  can fiscally poke holes in it but the world's inflating their currencies this
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:33.600]  is a global system so now we have to be in charge on top when the other
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:38.240]  countries go down so that we have the world currency and not them oh that's
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:41.920]  brilliant Alex yeah I didn't think of that but that that makes a lot of sense
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:47.480]  and Trump if anyone can bring us out of this you know this this crisis we're in
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:52.960]  it's Donald Trump and again like he said putting money in the hands of his
[2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:56.520]  small business owners was a brilliant move because that's where most of jobs
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:02.040]  come from in America amazing gateway pundit calm breaking articles how many

[2:32:50.080 --> 2:32:55.320]  it's very a sophisticated and looks not human
[2:32:56.680 --> 2:33:02.080]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:02.080 --> 2:33:15.640]  I got off the riverboat in New Orleans in the spring of 82 I walked into a
[2:33:15.640 --> 2:33:25.440]  gambling house as gamblers often do I had myself a drink and I joined in a
[2:33:25.440 --> 2:33:34.280]  poker game the dealer was a woman so I asked her for her name she smiled at me
[2:33:34.280 --> 2:33:40.080]  so pretty but a hush fell over the place as a big man crossed the table stood up
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:51.600]  and slapped my face oh a knife oh a knife a long glitter and steel if my gun
[2:33:51.600 --> 2:33:58.160]  don't take your evil life you can bet my oh a knife will we went live with the
[2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:02.720]  video two hours ago at Band-Aid video and I'm really pleased to see it as

[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:17.280]  conservatively just on am stations according to the ratings what if the
[2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:22.080]  million people that listen throughout this hour went to Band-Aid video and
[2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:27.840]  sent that video to everyone they knew and said this is the group behind the
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:32.920]  coronavirus and the coming poisoned vaccine
[2:34:34.160 --> 2:34:39.480]  they're fighting around the clock to shut us down they've run espionage

[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:52.320]  in the government that have countered it and proud of corporations they've not
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:55.480]  been able to do it but it's been one hell of a fight because we're over the
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:35:00.080]  target but what is the name of the video we'll put it back on screen for folks

[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:30.280]  researched the occult and globalist quite a bit I did sneak into Bohemian
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:34.720]  Grove and when I was growing up I did keep running into a lot of real dark
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:38.960]  occultic stuff in Dallas it's more New Agey here in Austin but there's some of
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:43.200]  that going on here as well and I did you know a few times go out with really rich
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:47.760]  beautiful older girls it turned out were trying to recruit me into
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:53.480]  Luciferianism basically and so I did brush into some of that but I was never
[2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:58.120]  willingly a participant and I did twice get taken to really serious stuff and I
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:02.040]  left one time had to well I'm gonna get into it just doesn't sound like
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:05.320]  reality it's just too too incredible like everything we do here but I have
[2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:10.120]  beat people's asses I'll just leave it at that so let's just go to you you're
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:13.960]  asking about a low-level altar there's all sorts of occult and a lot of witch
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:20.920]  craft a lot of kind of entry door wick of stuff has low stone tables that they do
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:24.760]  rituals on I have seen those in documentaries and like on history
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:28.600]  channel and things but I've never I've never you know actually infiltrated any
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:31.960]  group or anything and saw that type of thing well what's your what's your
[2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:37.800]  question getting it up I'm interested okay 20 years ago a little more than
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:42.840]  that I'm betting but been with this guy for 20 years okay and over the years I
[2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:47.760]  tried at various times to extract enough information that I could bag him and his
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:53.560]  friends but it really wasn't possible but I decided to just while leaving that
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:57.480]  leaving the personal relationship out here's the thing he was part of the
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:40:02.360]  element that was actually present for human sacrifices and the first I got
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:06.920]  wind of this was a friend's grandson who had been killed apparently the security
[2:40:06.920 --> 2:40:12.520]  leak and okay he was in San Mateo County in San Francisco which is I mean in
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:19.520]  California which has a reputation as the most corrupt county in the state there's
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:24.840]  this devil worship from end of end of the state right but I mean this one here's
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:29.160]  the thing this was one of the few counties that did not have the sheriff's
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:33.000]  office be the same as the coroner's office which is a pretty common thing
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:37.120]  across across the country and should be illegal because when you have the corner
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:42.320]  as a sheriff of the sheriff's up to something then you know have you seen
[2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:46.320]  the movie race with the devil I think so they move it's excellent like based in
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:49.480]  Texas Hill Country and they see a sacrifice and then the police are
[2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:54.520]  chasing them super super good movie and I mean a lot of these towns are actually
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:58.640]  been taken over by Satanist Ted Gunnerson told me that 25 years ago last
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:03.440]  year it was released FBI files on the FBI website of indeed some of the
[2:41:03.440 --> 2:41:08.040]  investigations Gunnerson was involved where Satanist got partial control of
[2:41:08.040 --> 2:41:14.080]  small towns yes and for example in holster, California what I noticed that
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:17.760]  I did a lot of researching would recognize some lingo the web page for the
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:22.480]  city it would have you know normal statements but like something of
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:27.440]  something else the ovens of O.F. was spelled O.V. and the something rather
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:34.400]  the V was spelled instead of T.H.E. was spelled T.H.E. which is Genesis P
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:40.660]  orages temple of psychic use Satanist operation yeah all sorts exactly and the
[2:41:40.660 --> 2:41:43.720]  French Revolution they were into changing language and letters and doing
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:48.120]  things in reverse and what it is just organized crime using Satanism as an
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:52.440]  operating system just like MS-13 to get you know become an inner memory about a
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:55.960]  torture of the young innocent person to death for Satan and that's exactly what
[2:41:55.960 --> 2:41:59.040]  goes on all right well God bless you ma'am I appreciate your call now I got to
[2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:03.560]  get to everybody now we'll go to break and I'm gonna go just go to everybody I've
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:06.520]  got to get to you for Watson comes up because he's got a lot to cover and I
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:09.840]  know he wants the full-time on air we love having Watson always very very

[2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:38.680]  they don't want you to have people will tune into it and then tell them spread
[2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:41.960]  the word and it's a chain reaction we've been doing it successfully and they
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:45.960]  are so pissed but if I'm gonna risk my life and do this I want to do it for the
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:48.880]  maximum effect and I know you do as well so join the fight if you haven't

[2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:20.560]  there and the globalist had worked around the clock to take him off air but
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:24.920]  something's happening. The public has been spreading the word that the Forbidden

[2:45:57.720 --> 2:46:04.080]  say oh Alex Jones is so smart oh he's so great I can hear less about that. I want
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:08.560]  you to understand that back in mid-January during the whole fake
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:13.840]  impeachment fiasco the rest of it I was pointing out that the biggest you would
[2:46:13.840 --> 2:46:18.480]  be the next move the next attack the globalists were going to launch they knew they didn't have
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:22.280]  the votes back down and I said would be an attack on the economy because
[2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:27.800]  criminals loved to brag and they were telegraphing the entire thing and now
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:31.440]  here we are ladies and gentlemen our economy shut down for over a month
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:36.400]  certain depression if it continues for more than a month and a half or so maybe
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:41.680]  even shorter and Americans have failed the test they have gotten into the fear
[2:46:41.680 --> 2:46:47.320]  they've enjoyed not going into work it's been a new drama and the globalists
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:51.000]  are saying hell let's destroy their way of life forever let's kill their
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:55.720]  confidence and give them a depression people better wake up now
[2:46:55.720 --> 2:47:12.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:47:12.720 --> 2:47:23.280]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:29.480]  we already played this clip but it's on infowars.com this is the UN and then
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:32.080]  Tucker Carlson asked how will Americans respond to health authorities remove
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:36.640]  family members from their homes oh you've got COVID-19 oh you've got the
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:42.280]  antibody oh you're this is just total tyranny government's lack of exit
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:46.520]  strategy sparse concern Trump's health advisory Dr. Fauci says there we may
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:50.560]  never go back to normal that's a quote well Bill Gates is running that remember
[2:47:50.560 --> 2:47:54.320]  that big article on infowars.com social distancing man arrested for playing

[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:31.240]  years great product yeah we all know that Bill Gates the Rockefellers all the
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:39.120]  elite was behind creating and our own CDC Fauci he's a fell out he's deep state
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:45.960]  he's bought I'd say he's actually like you know like one of David Rockefeller's
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:55.040]  fingers oh hell yeah and and we all know that this if Trump does not win because
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:49:02.360]  most Americans will vote for Trump if they happen to cheat and say that Joe
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:09.880]  Biden wins the presidency do you know what we will have a civil war that's
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:13.640]  right and they plan to say again that'll be the next fall they're beta testing
[2:49:13.640 --> 2:49:17.240]  saying oh they'll stay in your homes when they kill Trump or removing this is all
[2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:21.160]  about training you for martial law well you know they've sent three missiles in
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:25.520]  the past eight months to try to kill him you know there's just been incredible
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:28.560]  stuff happening Tina thank you so much for holding let's go ahead and take
[2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:32.800]  another call here let's talk to Tim and Texas go ahead
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:37.760]  hey yeah Alex you're a great caller before taking so much time I'm just
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:41.320]  trying to speed through mine real quick about to get on with your great work my
[2:49:41.320 --> 2:49:46.160]  first point I got down to all info wars on people who put orders in would hit
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:50.760]  that $10 donate button and then when you get down to the shipping paper the
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:54.160]  shipping we can push info wars over the top to keep them doing their great work
[2:49:54.160 --> 2:49:57.200]  doing that I challenge everybody I gotta say we were gonna have trouble staying on
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:49:59.760]  air this year but everybody's come through and we're able to actually stay
[2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:02.880]  on air and you know in the face of all these enemies and I don't want to tempt
[2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:10.080]  fate but the Supreme Court of Texas of five of the fake lawsuits in Texas before
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:14.960]  we ever went to the trial before we go to the kangaroo stuff in Austin four of
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:18.680]  the cases have been taken up on the merits which usually means they overturn
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:26.880]  so these these these Soros Bloomberg you know funded deals of thanks to God
[2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:31.920]  was taking a lot of money to get to that point to it's starting to come unglued
[2:50:31.920 --> 2:50:36.680]  but go ahead the other thing is when you get when I get my orders in you get
[2:50:36.680 --> 2:50:40.240]  those little those little thumb-sized stickers I leave a trail of those everywhere I go on
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:44.440]  the gas pumps on the door when I go in the gas station the elevator button you
[2:50:44.440 --> 2:50:48.640]  know ATM machines the checkout machines they're everywhere I've been you know
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:51.560]  that's another thing everybody can do with those little stickers that you send
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:55.920]  in the little free stickers my next point is just from me to replace that
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:51:00.840]  farce farce policy with someone like Dr. Shiva we need to focus on nutrition and
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:04.240]  natural healing like that it makes a big difference since I learned about
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:07.840]  nutrition I I kid you not I haven't had a cold or food I haven't suffered any of
[2:51:07.840 --> 2:51:13.840]  that since 2003 that's a long pretty good long duration it's all about
[2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:19.800]  nutrition okay then my last point this is I called I guess a warning to the
[2:51:19.800 --> 2:51:26.280]  global south there we the people were activating we're not only activating but
[2:51:26.280 --> 2:51:31.520]  what I can feel is a spiritual awakening you know what I feel it too and and
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:34.560]  because for every action there's an opposite equal reaction so when evil
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:38.480]  comes in instead of groveling in fear go God I need your help I love you I love
[2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:42.720]  others I want to be strong help me be strong and see God's about free will
[2:51:42.720 --> 2:51:46.160]  as you have to you have to open yourself up and it's literally an
[2:51:46.160 --> 2:51:50.680]  energetic system and it makes me feel absolutely the same I'm very strong but
[2:51:50.680 --> 2:51:53.720]  also very very humble to feel God's presence me just let's just feel God's
[2:51:53.720 --> 2:51:57.840]  presence just feel it no left-makes jokes but this is powerful and I just
[2:51:57.840 --> 2:52:04.280]  can't handle it oh my god it's amazing thank you God oh it's just
[2:52:04.280 --> 2:52:11.160]  incredible God bless you brother I appreciate you yeah I don't know how
[2:52:11.160 --> 2:52:15.040]  as I get older I just get stronger and stronger I can just man I can just sit
[2:52:15.040 --> 2:52:19.040]  there totally zone in and just like then I just start seeing everything but I'll
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:22.160]  be honest I can't handle it I know a people run towards evil because they
[2:52:22.160 --> 2:52:27.640]  just can't handle how real it is we plugged in to the big guys presence it's
[2:52:27.640 --> 2:52:38.160]  like wow let's go ahead and take some calls here Nathan in Utah you're on the

[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:45.000]  I mean just overpacked with trucks just sitting hardly moving all the roads I
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:50.640]  drive I see very little trucks you know well if anybody needs a mail out it's
[2:53:50.640 --> 2:53:55.760]  the truck drivers that's essential boy you talk about essential and the railways
[2:53:55.760 --> 2:54:00.320]  can't do it we're not built for that and we keep close much longer we're gonna
[2:54:00.320 --> 2:54:04.280]  be in a great depression folks oh I know I've been trying to tell everyone that
[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:11.360]  and personally I am ready for Trump to use his powers to use the military and
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:16.280]  I'm pretty sure that most of America and would support Trump to go after all
[2:54:16.280 --> 2:54:22.200]  these shy com Tommy traders in our government and globalist and just let's
[2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:26.400]  round them up absolutely Nathan got a jump they're trying to put it in a
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:29.320]  martial law to get rid of him so they've already brought us there he has to use
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:32.240]  it to get us out of it and that's where we are we're in martial law now my
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:36.200]  friends and the left's gonna keep the city shut watch when Trump tries to open
[2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:40.240]  them that we're being held hostage Ryan in New York thanks for holding you're
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:44.780]  on the air hey how's it going Alex good go ahead sir all right first time
[2:54:44.780 --> 2:54:48.160]  caller here I've been listening to you since back in about October and you know
[2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:51.440]  love your products all that stuff's great keeping my prayers always thank you
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:55.600]  for doing the show so I was listening to you guys over the last week and I heard
[2:54:55.600 --> 2:54:59.600]  something about the corona cases are actually being inflated by the common
[2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:03.880]  cold oh that's absolutely I've got the articles right here most the tests are
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:07.840]  false that it's actually for regular corona and a lot of folks are you know
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:10.480]  sick and old and already are dying of the cold because they're already run down
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:14.640]  they call it dying of old age and that's absolutely true sir right it's
[2:55:14.640 --> 2:55:19.880]  ever from the COVID-19 now you see all these cities that are going around with
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:23.640]  the with smog is lessening and the pollution is lessening do you think
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:27.320]  maybe the weather change could also be affecting people getting people sick
[2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:31.840]  because the weather is changing so drastically and that's a good point I
[2:55:31.840 --> 2:55:35.240]  go out my allergies aren't as bad and most of that is the particular from all
[2:55:35.240 --> 2:55:39.360]  the cars like I went out to a ranch far away from cars last week for a day and
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:43.360]  I was out there in the middle of pollen it wasn't burning my eyes and stuff it's
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:48.000]  it's it's the particular and it is true that you know air pollution it is a big
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:51.040]  cause of death some estimates are like seven million people die a year from
[2:55:51.040 --> 2:55:57.400]  air pollution that exacerbates it and so definitely very interesting point you
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:02.440]  know I know you were saying the 5g also has some effect on the body as well look
[2:56:02.440 --> 2:56:06.520]  up all electromagnetic stuff lowers your immunity and they're like oh 5g
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:09.560]  smartphones can cause cancer big wireless doesn't when you know that's wired
[2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:14.800]  magazine two years ago with big studies but now British 5g towers are being set
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:17.880]  on fire because of coronavirus conspiracy theories it goes on to say oh
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:25.160]  cell towers don't hurt you CB CNBC it's good for you BS BS these things hurt us
[2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:29.840]  and they're assaulting us with these damn things and 5g is way worse than
[2:56:29.840 --> 2:56:33.080]  the other types it's on record and what do you expect people to do just sit
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:37.400]  there and take it we're not taking it anymore globalist and you push much
[2:56:37.400 --> 2:56:42.080]  further you know where your heads are gonna be sorry good I love I love it I
[2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:45.360]  love the energy brother I really do and I love how you speak about God to that
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:49.640]  energy that he gives you it's amazing and you really it's not energy to roll
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:54.160]  over they got a feel for themselves and they can't you can't describe it to
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:56:57.480]  anybody you really can't you know it's amazing we're all going through a lot
[2:56:57.480 --> 2:57:00.600]  of drastic changes say people are waking up we got the weather's changing
[2:57:00.600 --> 2:57:04.440]  drastically around people they're seeing the world in a different way we got 5g
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:10.240]  rolling out it's a lot of changes man 5g spies on you it fries you it's banned
[2:57:10.240 --> 2:57:13.320]  in countries like Israel that invented it now they're trying to lift the band
[2:57:13.320 --> 2:57:18.680]  and Switzerland's banning it the rich people don't want it around them it's
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:25.000]  bad for you my listen my wife and I when we were in DC are like why are we
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:28.560]  dizzy why are we dizzy and I looked it up that's what 5g does we were right by
[2:57:28.560 --> 2:57:33.480]  a damn 5g tower on top the hotel we were in on the top floor it was like five
[2:57:33.480 --> 2:57:37.880]  feet through the roof on top of us and I wouldn't looked it up that's what it
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:46.120]  does like why are we sick a 5g tower we knew early on the COVID-19 was an
[2:57:46.120 --> 2:57:49.760]  engineered bio weapon but again people say oh then it must be the most deadly
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:54.840]  thing ever no it does clearly kill people but if you're gonna release a bio
[2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:59.000]  weapon for fear and to bankrupt an economy and cause panic and to run
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:02.840]  folks off the edge of a cliff and a giant artificial stampede you want to
[2:58:02.840 --> 2:58:06.120]  know the real trajectory kill a bunch of old people kill people that are
[2:58:06.120 --> 2:58:10.080]  deficient kill people that are already sick get rid of folks the global stone
[2:58:10.080 --> 2:58:14.880]  even want anyways but scare everybody else you want to control in to
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:19.160]  submission and that's what's going on so people get confused by the paradox of
[2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:22.520]  you say it's a real virus you say it's serious but you say don't panic and
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:26.160]  don't shut the economy down exactly because if you do that they're gonna
[2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:30.720]  keep releasing bio weapons over and over again because it works so well on the
[2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:35.520]  public most people are starting to wake up but we have to understand that
[2:58:35.520 --> 2:58:38.600]  pressures being put on Trump to basically keep the economy shut for
[2:58:38.600 --> 2:58:42.360]  other six months to a year we'll be in a depression long before then we've got to
[2:58:42.360 --> 2:58:48.120]  go back to work it's been sold out for more than four months but our best
[2:58:48.120 --> 2:58:54.680]  selling vitamin D3 and vitamin K formula is back in stock winner son in the
[2:58:54.680 --> 2:58:58.000]  fall in the winter as you know your body when you're not getting sunlight on
[2:58:58.000 --> 2:59:04.240]  the skin does not produce vitamin D3 so it's important to ingest it but a lot
[2:59:04.240 --> 2:59:08.760]  of people do not absorb it well in the gut so you take this formula under the
[2:59:08.760 --> 2:59:13.520]  tongue it tastes sweet naturally let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute
[2:59:13.520 --> 2:59:19.680]  and then you swallow the rest and it's just amazing it's back in stock and yes

[3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:11.120]  full war transmission I'm your host alex jones all Joseph Watson takes over in T
[3:00:11.120 --> 3:00:18.800]  minus six minutes. It's a good song right here hard to turn this off but let's get
[3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:28.920]  to your calls. Wayno from Arizona you're on the air welcome. Thanks for taking my
[3:00:28.920 --> 3:00:35.440]  call alex actually I want to get to the point of 5G about two years ago I
[3:00:35.440 --> 3:00:41.440]  started hearing these frequencies in my head and I started playing with them and
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:45.640]  started going higher and higher and higher and higher and after a while they
[3:00:45.640 --> 3:00:51.760]  started something started attacking me then as I was driving down the street
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:56.600]  anywhere I drove during the day the street lights would come on and at
[3:00:56.600 --> 3:01:01.600]  nighttime the lights got so bright I have to wear my sunglasses at night now
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:08.320]  I've recorded two years of video of this happening with the lights. By the way
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:12.720]  people have done this in the UK I had the engineer on who works for MI6 and he
[3:01:12.720 --> 3:01:15.760]  showed what they're doing when they drive through they go oh it turns on when
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:19.080]  it sees your car but it's way way brighter than it should be and then
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:23.240]  there's a bunch of RF blasting the cars at night when you're out there and it
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:28.240]  turns out that they're g5 towers I've actually seen those videos and I've
[3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:34.240]  actually have them I'm editing them now but I've also this is actually as well
[3:01:34.240 --> 3:01:38.680]  as a plea out there for maybe some attorneys to bring a lawsuit against 5G
[3:01:38.680 --> 3:01:45.520]  not only do they do that with the lights but as I'm sitting here talking with you
[3:01:45.520 --> 3:01:50.080]  they're actually taking the air for my for my breath I can't breathe.
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:53.200]  Well here's the problem sir it's hard to distinguish I'm not saying
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:57.120]  or mentally ill this from schizophrenia but here's what we know the CIA
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:02:00.720]  admits they have cell towers they tested in the late 90s to control people's
[3:02:00.720 --> 3:02:06.760]  emotions that Japan 20 years ago had soft drink machines that would non-audibly
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:12.120]  fire a sound wave into your head where you hear it but nobody else does so they
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:15.800]  definitely have all these technologies it's insane it's out of control and we
[3:02:15.800 --> 3:02:19.200]  know that these wavelengths do affect human behavior God bless you all right
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:23.640]  let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Texas here on the air go ahead
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:35.520]  Welcome. I was just going to say me and my girlfriend we're looking forward to seeing you at Skankfest
[3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:38.880]  and real quick I know you've got a lot of callers to get to there's a lot of
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:41.880]  confusion whether this came from the globalist or this came from China I
[3:02:41.880 --> 3:02:44.920]  don't see why it can't be both though these are the same people that have the
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:48.600]  Apple keys held in China so what's what's to stop the globalists from working
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:52.920]  with China to release the coronavirus. Oh yeah the globalists run China I totally agree
[3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:56.320]  with China being behind this just means the globalists find it. Hey Skankfest
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:03:01.300]  isn't that something that Sam Tripoli goes to? He was going to go to but it's
[3:03:01.300 --> 3:03:05.040]  Lewis J. Gomez, Tim Dillon, a whole bunch of awesome comedians and it's a great
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:08.560]  political. Did somebody say I was going to that? People say I'm going to things I've
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:12.320]  never heard of. Yeah there was a rumor that you were going to be a special guest
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:15.960]  I wasn't sure if it was true or not. Okay well people yeah I just want to be
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:19.520]  clear that if I'm coming to something I'll tell you I'm coming all right.
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:23.480]  That's a great point about Apple and all that move over to China. Trump fights it
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:26.760]  now big tech goes along with China and our lockdown and what do you think's
[3:03:26.760 --> 3:03:31.800]  going to happen when they don't turn the economy back on when Trump does and the
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:35.360]  corporations in California and other liberal areas just keep us hijacked I
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:38.480]  mean this is going to be a big problem. Well not only that but if you look who's
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:42.840]  directly benefiting from all this we're having privacy issues with Zoom through
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:46.760]  the Chinese company. My company uses Zoom for our meetings so now that
[3:03:46.760 --> 3:03:51.000]  everybody's home we're using the Chinese software because we're giving art. Oh yeah
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:53.960]  that's why the government has said don't have home assistance in your house
[3:03:53.960 --> 3:03:58.200]  turn it all off or don't have it and the military bandit years ago oh
[3:03:58.200 --> 3:04:02.880]  Jones is crazy he says they're listening it's in the damn patents. God bless you
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:06.720]  Chris I'm out of time. Greg and Justin I'm sorry to get to you. We took 26
[3:04:06.720 --> 3:04:10.960]  calls that's what I was asking 25, 26 calls. I appreciate the callers we're

[3:04:50.040 --> 3:04:58.200]  absorption. Some time during the month of March in the year 2020 the nations of
[3:04:58.200 --> 3:05:04.640]  the planet began to slip permanently into a form of martial law a
[3:05:04.640 --> 3:05:13.000]  technocracy a control grid enforced by a medical tyranny aided by robots and
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:20.560]  drones overseeing the human population everyone was suspect everyone could be a
[3:05:20.560 --> 3:05:25.600]  carrier it didn't matter if it was the common cold that have been weaponized it
[3:05:25.600 --> 3:05:29.920]  didn't matter it came out of the Wu Han level four by a weapons lab it didn't
[3:05:29.920 --> 3:05:36.600]  matter a bill Gates's fingerprints were all over it the crime was so big that no
[3:05:36.600 --> 3:05:42.040]  one dared challenge the power structure and thousands of years of hard-fought
[3:05:42.040 --> 3:05:47.440]  basic jurisprudence and human rights disappeared in the twinkle of an eye and
[3:05:47.440 --> 3:05:53.880]  humanity slipped beneath the waves of the long dark winter
[3:05:53.880 --> 3:06:03.080]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson
[3:06:05.240 --> 3:06:11.680]  well it is 8 p.m. on this Tuesday the 7th of April and I was just listening out
[3:06:11.680 --> 3:06:15.480]  the window because our Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in hospital in
[3:06:15.480 --> 3:06:20.320]  intensive care with symptoms of coronavirus which he hasn't been able
[3:06:20.320 --> 3:06:26.600]  to shake off for over a week now in the United Kingdom we've had this event
[3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:33.080]  this clapathon this religious worship of a state institution the NHS every week
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:38.120]  at 8 p.m. on Thursday evening people lean out of their windows they come out
[3:06:38.120 --> 3:06:43.000]  their front doors they dare to were tempted to violate the lockdown measures
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:48.160]  they bang their pots and pans they applaud they even had bagpipes last week
[3:06:48.160 --> 3:06:53.880]  they had fireworks the second time in worship of the state institution which
[3:06:53.880 --> 3:06:58.120]  is a religious institution basically now in the UK and if you don't worship it
[3:06:58.120 --> 3:07:04.400]  you will be punished all hail the NHS so every week people have been leaning out
[3:07:04.400 --> 3:07:09.560]  the window going on their balconies applauding the NHS somebody suggested
[3:07:09.560 --> 3:07:13.760]  applauding Boris Johnson the leader of the country because he's in very dire
[3:07:13.760 --> 3:07:20.120]  strates in intensive care right now nothing absolutely nothing I was
[3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:25.440]  checking for a good couple of minutes didn't hear one person down the entire
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:29.680]  street on both sides applauding absolutely nothing so much for the
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:35.280]  tolerant left people tried to arrange it but you know he's not a religious
[3:07:35.280 --> 3:07:39.520]  institution like the NHS so I guess nobody cares about him he's the leader
[3:07:39.520 --> 3:07:43.840]  of the country in this moment of supposed peril but nobody can even be
[3:07:43.840 --> 3:07:47.440]  bothered to lean out of their window or sit on their balconies and
[3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:50.520]  balconies and applaud him for more than two minutes of course many of the same
[3:07:50.520 --> 3:07:56.440]  people who were on their balconies on Thursday applauding the NHS these
[3:07:56.440 --> 3:08:00.920]  frontline workers putting their own lives at risk of being infected with
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:06.760]  coronavirus were two days later having barbecue parties with all their friends
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:11.880]  on that same balcony in the sunshine infecting each other with coronavirus
[3:08:11.880 --> 3:08:16.440]  but you know at least they got the selfie that they could put on Instagram to
[3:08:16.440 --> 3:08:21.320]  prove what good people they are on the Sunday afterwards they were all out in
[3:08:21.320 --> 3:08:25.600]  the park sunbathing in large groups of people but again at least they can claim
[3:08:25.600 --> 3:08:30.560]  that they're good people because they applauded the NHS for two minutes and I'm
[3:08:30.560 --> 3:08:35.640]  sure they'll do so again nobody applauded for Boris Johnson in intensive
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:39.520]  care right now what a shame that wasn't predictable at all was it and then in
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:44.400]  fact there's an article here up on summit news clapping for NHS reminds
[3:08:44.400 --> 3:08:49.160]  author of communist despotism and this is Theodore Dalrymple a British
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:54.400]  author who says the country's weekly activity of clapping in support of the
[3:08:54.400 --> 3:08:59.040]  NHS reminds him of how party members were forced to enthusiastically applaud
[3:08:59.040 --> 3:09:04.800]  communist despots or face being labeled dissidents now of course nobody's
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:10.000]  comparing this to the consequences of people who refuse to clap for Stalin
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:15.240]  back 1890 years ago we're not saying that but there are similarities between
[3:09:15.240 --> 3:09:21.480]  the two as he notes in this article it reminds me a little in its tendency to
[3:09:21.480 --> 3:09:26.320]  get longer and louder and almost more hysterical of the applause after a
[3:09:26.320 --> 3:09:31.040]  speech by Nicolao Ceausescu or other communist despots in which everyone in
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:36.440]  the audience had to show himself as enthusiastic as the most enthusiastic
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:41.880]  applauder to continue applauding as long as someone else was applauding to not
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:46.480]  be the first one to show a sign of disloyalty and descend from the official
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:52.960]  line and in fact it's a well-known trait amongst communist dictators both Kim
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:58.320]  Jong-un Kim Jong-il and of course Stalin himself as well as Ceausescu many
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:03.960]  such cases of where for example in North Korea the applause would go on for so
[3:10:03.960 --> 3:10:08.800]  long that people would literally be collapsing we're talking about members
[3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:12.440]  of the government communist party Stalinist party members would literally
[3:10:12.440 --> 3:10:18.440]  be collapsing and fainting because they were clapping for so long and didn't want
[3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:24.600]  to be seen as the first person to stop clapping so echoes of that in this NHS
[3:10:24.600 --> 3:10:28.000]  thing we're not saying it's exactly the same obviously that would be stupid but
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:35.080]  he's right when he says that it doesn't start enthusiastic and taper off it gets
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:40.400]  louder and louder and louder as each person tries to outdo the other with
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:45.640]  this emotionally kitsch fake enthusiasm and this is something now that's
[3:10:45.640 --> 3:10:51.520]  happening every single week in the UK again many of these people a couple of
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:55.920]  days later we're all out violating the same quarantine provisions that are
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:11:01.240]  supposed to be in place to save the lives of NHS workers but as long as they
[3:11:01.240 --> 3:11:04.920]  got the Instagram selfie I guess that's all that mattered for most of them and
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:12.480]  again it's this lazy superficial gesture which in fact helps nobody it's got
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:15.640]  more attention than the hundreds of thousands people are actually volunteered
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:18.840]  for the NHS and again many of those people who volunteered are not gonna
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:22.920]  follow through on it but they're gonna tweet they're gonna tweet that they
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:28.520]  volunteered and get the dopamine and prove how much of a quote good person
[3:11:28.520 --> 3:11:35.160]  they are to all their friends now because Dalrymple also notes in his article in
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:38.720]  relation to the point I was making earlier about the NHS being a religious
[3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:44.040]  institution now in the UK how during the Middle Ages during the plague in the
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:49.600]  1600s in Europe when the cause of the epidemic was unknown people went out in
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:54.320]  the streets and self-flagellated with themselves tortured themselves made
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:59.160]  themselves bleed because they thought it was a sacrifice to God that would
[3:11:59.160 --> 3:12:05.120]  provide some relief from the plague some comes against some kind of sacrifice
[3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:10.040]  penance that would make it stop he says during the Middle Ages when the cause of
[3:12:10.040 --> 3:12:14.000]  epidemics was unknown other than the justified wrath of God there were long
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:18.440]  processions of self-flagellating penitent through the streets no doubt thought
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:21.320]  that the blood they drew from themselves in the pain that they suffered would
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:27.960]  abate the epidemic by causing God to relent and of course you've had top
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:31.200]  mullers come out in Iran and other countries in the Middle East and say
[3:12:31.200 --> 3:12:35.760]  that coronavirus is the wrath of Allah we need to repent we've had clerics in
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:40.720]  the West saying we need to pray and now we have people leaning out of their
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:45.200]  balconies and trying to outdo each other in terms of enthusiasm to worship the
[3:12:45.200 --> 3:12:51.080]  state institution known as the NHS and that is their form of self-flagellation
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:56.120]  that is their form of sacrifice because the NHS has become a kind of religious
[3:12:56.120 --> 3:13:02.600]  institution so deep down subconsciously they probably think that that may make
[3:13:02.600 --> 3:13:07.520]  this whole coronavirus thing relent and get better and that that is their form
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:16.000]  of sacrifice meanwhile BBC reports coronavirus YouTube Titans rules after
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:22.120]  David Ike 5g interview so apparently David Ike was doing a live stream with
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:27.200]  a broadcast called London real yesterday about 20 minutes after this live
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:32.760]  stream ended during which he talked about his claim that 5g towers were
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:38.600]  linked to coronavirus that stream was deleted by YouTube and since then
[3:13:38.600 --> 3:13:42.040]  YouTube come out have come out and said that they're banning all conspiracy
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:47.720]  theory videos falsely linking coronavirus symptoms to 5g networks now
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:52.080]  of course what this will do amongst conspiracy theorists who believe that
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:56.200]  there's a link between 5g networks and coronavirus will make them believe that
[3:13:56.200 --> 3:14:00.480]  conspiracy even more I'm gonna get more into this on the other side but we also
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:06.800]  have WhatsApp of course owned by Facebook Titans limits on message
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:11.360]  forwarding to counter coronavirus misinformation so now they're limiting
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:16.000]  the amount of people that you can forward a message from WhatsApp which is a
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:20.720]  private messenger app they're limiting the amount of people you can send it to
[3:14:20.720 --> 3:14:26.240]  to 5 and this is the beginning I predict that within probably a year or two
[3:14:26.240 --> 3:14:31.400]  they will literally start banning you from using private messenger services
[3:14:31.400 --> 3:14:36.080]  entirely because of the content of what you're sending across they claim that
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:40.400]  they can't see the content because WhatsApp is supposed to be encrypted
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:44.800]  owned by Facebook I'm sure you can trust them so they're just saying for the
[3:14:44.800 --> 3:14:50.800]  moment they're gonna detect how much how many times a message has been sent and
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:54.560]  then limit it based on that number and you can trust them that they're not
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:58.160]  reading the content of your messages this is Facebook and that's trustworthy
[3:14:58.160 --> 3:15:02.520]  cooperation in the world a year or two down the line they're just gonna ban
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:06.680]  people from using private messenger apps completely based on what they're
[3:15:06.680 --> 3:15:11.240]  saying in those apps so it will literally get to the point as to where it
[3:15:11.240 --> 3:15:13.840]  would be similar as you having a conversation on the phone with your
[3:15:13.840 --> 3:15:18.120]  family the phone company terminates your contract because they don't like what
[3:15:18.120 --> 3:15:23.200]  you're talking about this is the danger and it's coming to these private
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:27.200]  messenger apps by the way I don't normally by them you're doing your
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:29.520]  live show you're doing an incredible job I'm sitting around at lunch we're not
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:32.920]  gonna cut the video on me I'm the one that cannot be mentioned Voldemort here
[3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:36.920]  they actually said remember last year when they double banned us on Facebook
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:40.040]  and said you cannot say Paul Joseph Watson's name in a positive way or the
[3:15:40.040 --> 3:15:44.680]  other evil one so Paul Joseph the evil one now I can say your name they
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:48.520]  actually said that they're now gonna control what's on WhatsApp and they're
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:53.280]  now banning Alex Jones and Jordan Peterson videos from it fellow Patriots my

[3:20:17.280 --> 3:20:21.760]  so youtube has come out today and said well any content that disputes the
[3:20:21.760 --> 3:20:28.040]  existence for transmission of COVID-19 as described by the WHO and local health
[3:20:28.040 --> 3:20:34.360]  authorities is in violation of YouTube policies and David Ike who over the past
[3:20:34.360 --> 3:20:40.040]  I want to say two months has given numerous viral interviews to this
[3:20:40.040 --> 3:20:44.680]  London real network on YouTube I think at one point they said is one yesterday
[3:20:44.680 --> 3:20:50.880]  was the second most watched live stream on YouTube across the whole planet that
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:56.000]  day talking about 5g network linked to coronavirus which by the way I don't
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:01.760]  believe in at all Iran has no 5g network yet Iran has a massive problem with
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:06.640]  coronavirus there are no 5g towers in Iran I don't believe the conspiracy
[3:21:06.640 --> 3:21:10.720]  theory do I believe people should have the right to express their beliefs and
[3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:14.120]  talk about them on the internet without being censored by giant corporations who
[3:21:14.120 --> 3:21:19.520]  have a monopoly on information yes I think that that is more sanctified in
[3:21:19.520 --> 3:21:25.920]  terms of a right of expression than the threat the danger of a few idiots going
[3:21:25.920 --> 3:21:30.160]  out and trying to burn down 5g towers yes I believe that freedom of expression
[3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:35.360]  is more important than a few idiots trying to burn down 5g towers not that
[3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:40.840]  anyone should do that we're not telling anyone to do that but if you introduce
[3:21:40.840 --> 3:21:46.920]  the premise that content which disputes the transmission or the existence or
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:51.920]  transmission of COVID-19 as described by the WHO local health authorities and so
[3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:56.080]  that's in violation of YouTube policies you have to ask the question does that
[3:21:56.080 --> 3:22:02.400]  include the WHO itself because the WHO for about two months at the start of this
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:08.480]  coronavirus outbreak as it was occurring in Wuhan China amplified Chinese
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:15.720]  propaganda which we now know was certain to be fake news on January 14th the
[3:22:15.720 --> 3:22:20.200]  World Health Organization on their official Twitter account said there was
[3:22:20.200 --> 3:22:26.880]  no human-to-human transmission of coronavirus at all and they directly
[3:22:26.880 --> 3:22:31.040]  amplified Chinese fake news propaganda in making that claim of course now we
[3:22:31.040 --> 3:22:34.640]  know that there was human-to-human transmission at least a month before
[3:22:34.640 --> 3:22:40.320]  that if not in fact in November never mind December of course you had the
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:44.160]  World Health Organization saying that countries should not lock down their
[3:22:44.160 --> 3:22:48.600]  borders no border control measures at all should be implemented and that
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:54.840]  preventing the stigmatization of Chinese people was more important than
[3:22:54.840 --> 3:22:59.360]  national sovereign countries imposing border control something that
[3:22:59.360 --> 3:23:05.400]  inevitably led to more people dying from COVID-19 you had the mainstream media
[3:23:05.400 --> 3:23:10.200]  amplifying this rhetoric the two months solid they were the ones saying it's
[3:23:10.200 --> 3:23:14.800]  just the flu bro and I've flashed up that graphic which somebody compiled many
[3:23:14.800 --> 3:23:18.840]  many times we had the likes of the Washington Post the New York Times
[3:23:18.840 --> 3:23:25.320]  Vox media matters who now accused Fox News of putting out fake news about the
[3:23:25.320 --> 3:23:30.800]  coronavirus all of those media institutions in January and even up
[3:23:30.800 --> 3:23:37.600]  until early to mid-February were saying it's just the flu bro people say oh did
[3:23:37.600 --> 3:23:41.920]  they just they literally say it's just the flu bro no that's a meme they said
[3:23:41.920 --> 3:23:47.400]  the flu was a much bigger deal here are the headlines buzzfeed don't worry
[3:23:47.400 --> 3:23:52.520]  about the coronavirus worry about the flu they see another one from NPR
[3:23:52.520 --> 3:23:58.240]  amid coronavirus scare US counts thousands of flu deaths the New York the
[3:23:58.240 --> 3:24:04.560]  Washington Post sorry said flu is a much bigger threat those headlines were in
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:10.920]  January and into February that was fake news that was harmful disinformation as
[3:24:10.920 --> 3:24:14.880]  the Washington Post as buzzfeed sorry don't worry about the coronavirus worry
[3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:20.160]  about the flu that was disinformation that was fake news Chinese propaganda it
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:24.520]  was being put out by these massive mainstream media institutions the two
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:29.400]  months solid not only on their own websites but on YouTube because they
[3:24:29.400 --> 3:24:33.240]  all have channels on YouTube which are artificially inflated and boosted by
[3:24:33.240 --> 3:24:40.360]  YouTube whereas everyone else's channel gets sidelined and relegated so are they
[3:24:40.360 --> 3:24:46.080]  gonna get punished for their harmful fake news disinformation that they pushed
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:51.920]  for two months solid they're gonna get their video was deleted in fact I'm
[3:24:51.920 --> 3:24:55.560]  probably gonna go look later I'm gonna go through BuzzFeed's channel I'm gonna
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:24:59.640]  go through the Washington Post try and find if they had any specific videos
[3:24:59.640 --> 3:25:05.120]  which mirrored their headlines which we're saying coronavirus is not as bad
[3:25:05.120 --> 3:25:08.960]  as the flu which is basically you can take that to mean it's just the flu
[3:25:08.960 --> 3:25:15.040]  bro that was harmful misinformation that led to people dying because we weren't
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:19.560]  able to prepare for this quick enough in the Western world because they were
[3:25:19.560 --> 3:25:24.920]  amplifying Chinese fake news propaganda first of all saying there was no
[3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:29.720]  human-to-human transmission and second all of all saying that this was not a
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:35.920]  deadly pandemic when now we know the proper figures out of China are probably
[3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:42.080]  40,000 dead if not higher they report officially 3,000 and something dead now
[3:25:42.080 --> 3:25:47.240]  we know from US intelligence reports and the urns that were that had to be
[3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:52.880]  produced to keep all these the ashes of dead people at least 40,000 if not more
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:59.160]  in China mainstream media is culpable for amplifying all that fake news nothing
[3:25:59.160 --> 3:26:04.880]  will happen to them absolutely nothing BBC YouTube Titans rules after David
[3:26:04.880 --> 3:26:10.560]  Ike 5g interview YouTube has banned all conspiracy theory videos falsely linking
[3:26:10.560 --> 3:26:14.880]  coronavirus symptoms to 5g networks fast forward six months when this is all
[3:26:14.880 --> 3:26:19.960]  over YouTube has banned all conspiracy theory videos claiming that global
[3:26:19.960 --> 3:26:24.520]  warming isn't man-made you see it's a very easy step from that to that isn't
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:31.120]  it it's a very very short hop from claiming 5g link to coronavirus is a
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:34.960]  conspiracy theory which I would agree with to claiming that anybody who
[3:26:34.960 --> 3:26:40.000]  questions the man-made origin of climate change is also engaging in the same
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:45.720]  dangerous conspiracy theory and then all those videos get banned all those
[3:26:45.720 --> 3:26:49.360]  people who question that get banned and then maybe it'll move on to something
[3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:53.280]  even more obvious the Google-owned service will now delete videos violating
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:57.520]  the policy it had previously limited itself to reducing the frequency if
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:02.800]  recommended in its up next section so they already relegated them below a wall
[3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:06.680]  of mainstream media videos as they do with every video now which is not
[3:27:06.680 --> 3:27:12.160]  produced by Washington Post or New York Times or CNN or Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy
[3:27:12.160 --> 3:27:16.640]  Fallon or anyone like that and now they're just gonna remove the videos
[3:27:16.640 --> 3:27:21.880]  entirely it went very quickly didn't it from combating hate speech to simply
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:28.280]  removing videos because you disagree with the content what SAP as well has
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:32.960]  announced that it will ban basically the mass forwarding of messages because too
[3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:37.000]  many people were forwarding messages about 5g towers being linked to
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:41.320]  coronavirus which goes back to the original point and I tweet about this
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:46.520]  the fact that this conspiracy theory raged throughout the UK for the past two
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:50.040]  weeks and it did even my parents if my parents are telling me about this
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:55.640]  chances are it's embedded itself pretty deep into normie society which it did
[3:27:55.640 --> 3:28:00.600]  over the past two weeks so it was able to spread this conspiracy theory in a
[3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:04.800]  viral fashion throughout the entire population of the UK to a great extent
[3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:11.120]  proving once again that Facebook and Twitter and YouTube's war on fake news
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:16.640]  was never about combating quote harmful conspiracy theories it was about
[3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:22.200]  censoring right-wing political opinions because whatever they did if they if you
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:25.240]  take that as a good faith argument and that they actually took steps to
[3:28:25.240 --> 3:28:29.600]  eliminate conspiracy theories from their platforms how did this conspiracy
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:34.840]  theory spread throughout the entire country well maybe not so much anymore
[3:28:34.840 --> 3:28:40.840]  because they banned all mention of it on YouTube so we it remains to be seen how
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:46.000]  forcefully they will enact that policy and we'll give you an update that on that
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:49.000]  as soon as it happens coming up money is about the coronavirus breaking news at

[3:29:49.760 --> 3:29:57.960]  Amazon books my mind for more than eight weeks has been fixed constantly
[3:29:57.960 --> 3:30:02.800]  scanning constantly computing to understand the strategic attack we're
[3:30:02.800 --> 3:30:07.640]  witnessing we know by the scripting and the choreography and the fact that the
[3:30:07.640 --> 3:30:12.040]  virus has been scanned that it's man-made and attack on our economy the
[3:30:12.040 --> 3:30:16.040]  globalist media is firmly behind this devastating the United States and
[3:30:16.040 --> 3:30:21.360]  driving from from power but now we know from scores of studies from China the
[3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:28.640]  UK the United States Europe Brazil Japan that the virus reinfects and attacks
[3:30:28.640 --> 3:30:33.000]  different parts of the body that ladies and gentlemen is an engineered bio weapon
[3:30:33.000 --> 3:30:37.080]  just as the Indian scientists eight weeks ago conclusively proved their
[3:30:37.080 --> 3:30:42.800]  major university they have a name for it at the Pentagon it's called a soft kill
[3:30:42.800 --> 3:30:47.680]  weapon it doesn't kill you usually the first time but the next time the third
[3:30:47.680 --> 3:30:52.840]  time of the fourth it does and it weighs down your economy in the process when it

[3:32:55.200 --> 3:33:00.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:33:00.640 --> 3:33:15.400]  live from London England it's Paul Joseph Watson with summit.news
[3:33:15.400 --> 3:33:21.560]  now some countries in Europe specifically Austria as well as the Czech Republic and
[3:33:21.560 --> 3:33:26.680]  others have started to relax these lockdown measures from this week if not
[3:33:26.680 --> 3:33:31.800]  next week Austria is saying that it will begin to open schools again and then
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:36.760]  restaurants bars etc will follow after that that's not gonna happen in the UK
[3:33:36.760 --> 3:33:40.720]  anytime soon probably not until the end of May from what it looks like and not in
[3:33:40.720 --> 3:33:47.680]  America as well with New York suffering was it over 700 deaths today alone when
[3:33:47.680 --> 3:33:51.680]  will these lockdowns end this is what Tucker Carlson was asking in his monologue
[3:33:51.680 --> 3:33:56.080]  last night because he made the point that people are now according to some
[3:33:56.080 --> 3:34:01.480]  studies being reinfected with coronavirus after having supposedly
[3:34:01.480 --> 3:34:05.160]  beaten it in the first place if these lockdowns have to be staggered
[3:34:05.160 --> 3:34:09.760]  continually throughout the rest of the year and maybe the year after that what
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:14.280]  is that gonna do to an already battered economy these are the questions we need
[3:34:14.280 --> 3:34:19.080]  to be asking we also need to be asking the question about another World Health
[3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:23.760]  Organization official and what he said during a March 30 press conference when
[3:34:23.760 --> 3:34:29.200]  he suggested that people could be forcibly taken from their homes as we
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:32.880]  saw in Wuhan China took a calls and asked last night we're gonna roll the
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:36.800]  video right now how would Americans react to their own family members being
[3:34:36.800 --> 3:34:41.680]  forcibly removed from their homes here's the clip so if you've been sick you know
[3:34:41.680 --> 3:34:45.320]  that intensive care is not something that doctors recommend lightly Boris
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:50.040]  Johnson is clearly in danger tonight and that's a bad sign Johnson is in his
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:55.000]  mid 50s and hail enough to lead a country this can happen to him a lot of
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:34:59.040]  us should be worried and we are worried worried enough to endure things that
[3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:03.480]  just a month ago would have seemed preposterous last week Dr. Michael Ryan
[3:35:03.480 --> 3:35:06.840]  he's a leader at the World Health Organization announced that in response
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:10.800]  to the spread of this virus authorities may have to enter people's homes and
[3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:16.960]  remove family members presumably by force in most parts of the world due to
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:20.520]  lockdown most of the transmission that's actually happening in many
[3:35:20.520 --> 3:35:25.360]  countries now is happening in the household at family level in some
[3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:29.760]  senses transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family
[3:35:29.760 --> 3:35:36.040]  units now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:44.240]  be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner just so
[3:35:44.240 --> 3:35:48.560]  you know we're coming to your house seizing your children and quote isolating
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:53.000]  them in a safe and dignified manner whatever that means now that's not
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:57.080]  something under normal circumstances officially officials casually drop
[3:35:57.080 --> 3:36:01.080]  during briefings it's the kind of statement that might trigger violence
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:04.600]  people don't respond well when you threaten to take their kids but Ryan
[3:36:04.600 --> 3:36:08.280]  said it like it was no big deal and that's how the media treated it his
[3:36:08.280 --> 3:36:12.080]  threat didn't make headlines in any of the major newspapers in this country
[3:36:12.080 --> 3:36:16.760]  that's the kind of moment we're in so how long will this moment last well on
[3:36:16.760 --> 3:36:20.800]  Friday Eric Garcetti the mayor of Los Angeles predicted that the first in a
[3:36:20.800 --> 3:36:27.320]  series of lockdowns will go on until June one of the things that just concerns
[3:36:27.320 --> 3:36:31.120]  me it's not one of those immediate concerns but is you know this draws out
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:34.440]  through the summer and then then the cold weather comes around and then
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:38.000]  there's another wave of it how do you as a leader how do you think about this
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:41.200]  early on when people said is this just gonna be a few days or couple weeks I
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:44.600]  said no I think it's at least two months and I said if we're successful in
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:48.920]  this we can expect a second spike in the late fall or early winter that's how
[3:36:48.920 --> 3:36:53.920]  viruses work we better steal ourselves for a second and maybe even third round
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:58.000]  of this but we also need to be nimble enough to know we're not gonna flip a
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:04.400]  switch one day and turn the economy back on a quote second and maybe even
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:09.480]  third round of lockdowns that's a long time former Obama official Jason
[3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:12.880]  Furman who's now an economist at Harvard predicts the disruption may be even more
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:16.800]  severe than that quote we should certainly be prepared for a meaningful
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:20.560]  level of deliberate suspension of economic activity for the rest of the
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:24.760]  year will it be nice to know that there's a good reason for all of this of
[3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:29.120]  course everyone wants there to be a good reason sincerely yet the arguments for a
[3:37:29.120 --> 3:37:33.600]  prolonged national lockdown are starting to sound strained in a much discussed
[3:37:33.600 --> 3:37:36.600]  article on medium recently two academics from Pittsburgh argued that
[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:40.800]  lifting the lockdown at all even many months from now would be negligent
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:45.400]  quote as long as a large majority the population remains uninfected lifting
[3:37:45.400 --> 3:37:49.040]  containment measures will lead to an epidemic almost as large as what happened
[3:37:49.040 --> 3:37:53.680]  without having mitigations in place at all well that sounds plausible when you
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:37:58.720]  read it in fact it sounds like science but is it science a large majority the
[3:37:58.720 --> 3:38:04.680]  population remains uninfected they say but is that true we don't know it's true
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:08.880]  as it say nobody can say what percentage of the American population is infected
[3:38:08.880 --> 3:38:12.480]  or has been infected there haven't been large-scale randomized tests conducted
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:15.480]  here we don't even know when the disease first arrived in the United States
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:19.360]  there's informed speculation that this train of coronavirus has been here since
[3:38:19.360 --> 3:38:23.280]  late November or December authorities traced the first confirmed case to
[3:38:23.280 --> 3:38:27.880]  January 15th in Washington state an unnamed 35 year old Chinese immigrant
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:32.040]  landed the United States after visiting his family in Wuhan and wound up in a
[3:38:32.040 --> 3:38:36.200]  hospital outside Seattle apparently he recovered that depending on how you
[3:38:36.200 --> 3:38:40.880]  count the virus has been circulating among us for up to four months now for
[3:38:40.880 --> 3:38:43.680]  most of that time there was no systematic attempt to quarantine the
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:47.760]  population how many Americans were infected over that period again we
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:51.640]  don't even have a ballpark number for that but the number could be enormous
[3:38:51.640 --> 3:38:55.360]  because the virus turns out to be much easier to transmit than we thought it
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:39:00.000]  was on Friday you may have noticed the CDC issued new guidance on mask use the
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:04.600]  government now recommends wearing quote cloth face coverings in public why
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:08.000]  they make that change because researchers are learning more about how
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:11.960]  this virus moves from person to person scientists now believe the coronavirus
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:16.440]  can be transmitted by someone who shows no symptoms merely by speaking
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:19.920]  remember when they told you that hand washing was the key to staying safe
[3:39:19.920 --> 3:39:23.360]  that recommendation was based on the belief the virus lived mostly on
[3:39:23.360 --> 3:39:27.640]  surfaces and that's not the case we're still not exactly sure how the virus is
[3:39:27.640 --> 3:39:31.560]  spread but among some populations and this is interesting to know it appears
[3:39:31.560 --> 3:39:36.520]  to be astonishingly widespread an article in the Italian media last
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:40.160]  Thursday for example described a blood drive in a village in a Lumberty that's
[3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:44.440]  in the northern part the most infected part of the country of the 60 people who
[3:39:44.440 --> 3:39:48.880]  showed up to give blood 40 tested positive for coronavirus none had shown
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:52.760]  symptoms of it none knew they had it keep in mind that Lumberty has been
[3:39:52.760 --> 3:39:56.560]  strictly locked down by government order since March 9th that's almost a month
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:40:02.120]  ago yet about 70% of this group got it anyway a report from Hong Kong in
[3:40:02.120 --> 3:40:05.320]  February suggested that a woman diagnosed with the coronavirus may have
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:09.840]  infected others 10 floors away in the same apartment building even though she
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:13.240]  never came into contact with any of them health officials concluded the virus
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:16.960]  likely traveled through plumbing pipes to different apartments and it wasn't a
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:22.720]  wild guess in 2003 an outbreak of SARS spread the same way so it's starting to
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:26.240]  look like the coronavirus is more transmissible than we expected or were
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:31.480]  told the good news is it also seems far less lethal overall people are still
[3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:35.520]  dying in large numbers not all of them are sick or old and that's terrifying
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:39.600]  to watch but as the data trickle in there's evidence that many infected
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:44.800]  people are not sick Iceland has tested a larger percentage of its population than
[3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:48.920]  any country in the world they've tested about 5% of all citizens the United
[3:40:48.920 --> 3:40:54.320]  States by comparison has tested 0.3% so far about half those who've tested
[3:40:54.320 --> 3:40:59.600]  positive in Iceland have been completely asymptomatic so given all of this what is
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:03.720]  a wise response to this pandemic historically health officials have
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:08.160]  used quarantines to contain infectious diseases until now a quarantine
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:11.800]  consisted of separating the sick from the general population and then doing
[3:41:11.800 --> 3:41:15.280]  everything possible to protect the especially vulnerable in this case that
[3:41:15.280 --> 3:41:18.560]  would include the elderly and the immunosuppressed among other groups we've
[3:41:18.560 --> 3:41:22.240]  a pretty good idea that targeted quarantines work they've been used for
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:26.680]  centuries around the world but that's not what we did instead the United States
[3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:31.240]  in many other countries instituted mass quarantines in which government shut
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:35.760]  down entire nations for long periods that's never happened before now mass
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:39.360]  quarantine makes sense if you're fairly certain it will prevent mass infection
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:42.920]  but are we certain of that
[3:41:42.920 --> 3:41:47.280]  let's take a course and asking when the lockdowns will end they're gonna end in
[3:41:47.280 --> 3:41:52.000]  Austria it looks like earlier than any other country in the Western world and
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:57.160]  that's mainly because they close their border with Italy on March the 11th
[3:41:57.160 --> 3:42:02.600]  before any other countries imposed major border controls at least in Europe you
[3:42:02.600 --> 3:42:05.080]  look at Singapore you look at Russia they did similar things in their
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:08.920]  coronavirus death level levels in comparison to other countries in the
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:14.720]  region are low RT reports WHO blew it Trump accuses global health watchdog of
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:20.560]  being China centric despite largely US funded he's saying there needs to be an
[3:42:20.560 --> 3:42:26.560]  investigation of the WHO I agree with that the director general of the WHO who
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:30.520]  as in the next segment we're gonna get into was formerly a member of a violent
[3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:35.400]  communist revolutionary party wonder why he's now a water carrier for China some
[3:42:35.400 --> 3:42:40.000]  kind of connection there he needs to resign there's a massive petition out
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:44.120]  for him to resign he's got hundreds of thousands of signatures he lied he
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:47.840]  amplified Chinese propaganda it was harmful it led to a lot of people dying
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:42:52.240]  we'll talk about it on the other side summit dot news don't go away listen to
[3:42:52.240 --> 3:42:57.600]  me very carefully we have confirmed that California is set within days or
[3:42:57.600 --> 3:43:02.840]  weeks to announce a total stay at home order and we'll shut down grocery stores
[3:43:02.840 --> 3:43:07.840]  and yes even pharmacies ladies and gentlemen this is what they're
[3:43:07.840 --> 3:43:12.320]  announcing to create total panic to try to trigger a depression to blame on
[3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:16.520]  Trump then when Trump doesn't fall astute they will blame every single
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:23.200]  death on President Trump this is a Psyop using a real deadly virus this is
[3:43:23.200 --> 3:43:29.160]  super dangerous and everyone needs to get supplies in now the food chain is

[3:48:55.800 --> 3:49:02.080]  Daily Mail reports WHO director faces calls to resign for allowing China to
[3:49:02.080 --> 3:49:07.800]  cover up the true impact of coronavirus this is Ted Ross and Hannam who's facing
[3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:11.880]  growing calls to step down from US politicians for trusting the communist
[3:49:11.880 --> 3:49:15.160]  regime's official reporting about the extent of the spread of the disease
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:20.600]  Republican senator Martha McSally that Ted Ross should resign over the Chinese
[3:49:20.600 --> 3:49:27.240]  cover-up of course last week we had the deputy prime minister of Japan saying
[3:49:27.240 --> 3:49:32.120]  that the WHO should be renamed the Chinese Health Organization because of
[3:49:32.120 --> 3:49:36.600]  course at every point they praised China's response despite the fact that
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:41.360]  China China's response was to cover up the outbreak of coronavirus it was to
[3:49:41.360 --> 3:49:47.960]  cover up the origin of coronavirus which now you have top PhDs and former army
[3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:53.280]  colonels as we'll get on to saying that yes it likely emerged from the lab which
[3:49:53.280 --> 3:49:58.600]  was situated just a few hundred yards from the wet market or the Wuhan meat
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:03.680]  market which by the way the bat that they zeroed in on which they blamed for the
[3:50:03.680 --> 3:50:09.920]  outbreak of this new coronavirus that specific breed of bat was not sold at the
[3:50:09.920 --> 3:50:17.280]  Wuhan wet market it was not sold there it was located in that lab nearby just a
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:24.240]  coincidence though the WHO director let's call him Ted Ross because his other
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:30.080]  two names are virtually impossible to pronounce Ted Ross has a very interesting
[3:50:30.080 --> 3:50:33.800]  past of course he's been the point man the front man the figurehead of this
[3:50:33.800 --> 3:50:39.200]  coronavirus response the past three months consistently amplifying Chinese
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:43.560]  propaganda and praising China's response despite the fact that China's
[3:50:43.560 --> 3:50:47.680]  responsible for the outbreak of it for the cover-up of it for lying about the
[3:50:47.680 --> 3:50:51.480]  number of bed for lying in saying there was no human to human transmission back
[3:50:51.480 --> 3:50:57.880]  on January 14th and at every step of the way the WHO amplified that harmful fake
[3:50:57.880 --> 3:51:02.120]  news propaganda misinformation no action was taken against them by Twitter
[3:51:02.120 --> 3:51:08.320]  Facebook or YouTube of course and Ted Ross here has been very complimentary
[3:51:08.320 --> 3:51:14.160]  towards the communist Chinese and now we know why John Martin wrote up an
[3:51:14.160 --> 3:51:18.720]  excellent article called the crimes of Ted Ross adhanom I think I was posted
[3:51:18.720 --> 3:51:22.800]  over at his website it's at roughestimate.org it's linked in this
[3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:29.240]  summit news article where he points out that Mr. Ted Ross back in the day was a
[3:51:29.240 --> 3:51:35.080]  member of the T Gray People's Liberation Front TPLF a violent communist
[3:51:35.080 --> 3:51:40.360]  revolutionary party which was listed as a terrorist organization by the US
[3:51:40.360 --> 3:51:45.880]  government in the 1990s now this guy apparently was the third most important
[3:51:45.880 --> 3:51:51.080]  member of this revolutionary communist group and that later he got the job as
[3:51:51.080 --> 3:51:57.640]  the head of the WHO Martin writes how the TPLF engaged in systematic
[3:51:57.640 --> 3:52:03.680]  discrimination and human rights abuses by get this refusing emergency health
[3:52:03.680 --> 3:52:09.400]  care to the Amara ethnic group because they supported the opposition party in
[3:52:09.400 --> 3:52:14.600]  Ethiopia the opposition that had been brutally crushed by this revolutionary
[3:52:14.600 --> 3:52:20.240]  communist group of which Mr. Ted Ross was number three in command the ministry
[3:52:20.240 --> 3:52:27.240]  of health that oversaw these abuses where they denied medical treatment to an
[3:52:27.240 --> 3:52:32.680]  ethnic group really ethnic cleansing basically the ministry of health that
[3:52:32.680 --> 3:52:38.920]  oversaw this was at the time led by you guessed it Mr. Ted Ross birth rates were
[3:52:38.920 --> 3:52:42.280]  recorded to be significantly lower in this region where they denied the
[3:52:42.280 --> 3:52:47.320]  treatment and two million Amara people disappeared from the subsequent
[3:52:47.320 --> 3:52:53.120]  population census this is all in Ethiopia in the 2000s when this guy was
[3:52:53.120 --> 3:52:57.680]  number three in this violent revolutionary communist party now we hasten to
[3:52:57.680 --> 3:53:02.600]  say he's denied the allegations he's also denied the allegations that he was
[3:53:02.600 --> 3:53:07.680]  involved in another cover-up and took a call and spoke about this last week which
[3:53:07.680 --> 3:53:12.440]  centered around claims he had downplayed cholera epidemics in Ethiopia in 2006
[3:53:12.440 --> 3:53:19.600]  2009 and 2011 by passing them off as a Q watery diarrhea which is a symptom of
[3:53:19.600 --> 3:53:24.720]  cholera now Martin writes international organizations were pressured not to call
[3:53:24.720 --> 3:53:30.440]  it cholera despite the UN testing the infected and finding cholera and were
[3:53:30.440 --> 3:53:34.280]  pressured by government employees not to reveal the number of infected another
[3:53:34.280 --> 3:53:39.680]  stunning victory for the health minister so this guy even if you don't believe
[3:53:39.680 --> 3:53:43.800]  these claims are fully true there's a lot of evidence to suggest they are has
[3:53:43.800 --> 3:53:50.720]  been implicated in cover-ups of health emergencies in Ethiopia multiple times
[3:53:50.720 --> 3:53:55.640]  has been accused of being involved in withdrawing medical treatment for
[3:53:55.640 --> 3:54:01.040]  entire ethnic groups leading to deaths is that the kind of guy who you would
[3:54:01.040 --> 3:54:07.160]  want anywhere near the head of a global health organization like the WHO just
[3:54:07.160 --> 3:54:13.360]  the tame alone of the accusations but of course China is very friendly with
[3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:18.480]  Ethiopia and they're very friendly with this particular revolutionary communist
[3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:23.160]  group and that's what helped him get the job according to John Martin as he
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:29.320]  explains in this article after Ted Ross was appointed for a minister of
[3:54:29.320 --> 3:54:33.240]  Ethiopia in 2012 dissidents and journalists across the country was
[3:54:33.240 --> 3:54:37.480]  subjected to brutal government crackdowns leading some to flee to exile in
[3:54:37.480 --> 3:54:43.680]  nearby Yemen and according to Martin Ted Ross was personally responsible for
[3:54:43.680 --> 3:54:48.600]  negotiating the extradition of these dissidents back to Ethiopia some of whom
[3:54:48.600 --> 3:54:55.440]  were subsequently imprisoned and tortured now what does that remind you of the
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:55:00.760]  imprisonment and torture of dissidents or in the case of China we go Muslims
[3:55:00.760 --> 3:55:05.880]  same thing was taking place in Ethiopia while this guy who is now the head of the
[3:55:05.880 --> 3:55:10.880]  WHO was apparently arranging the extradition of these dissidents who
[3:55:10.880 --> 3:55:14.880]  later went on to be tortured and the article goes through a ton of other
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:19.520]  news this is the guy amplifying Chinese fake news propaganda that was
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:23.400]  harmful and led to people dying for the past two months he should be
[3:55:23.400 --> 3:55:28.440]  investigated World Health Organization needs to be investigated he needs to
[3:55:28.440 --> 3:55:36.520]  resign meanwhile CNN suggests wearing a face mask mask in public is you guessed
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:41.000]  it racist CNN has published a lengthy article suggesting that wearing face
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:45.280]  masks to guard against the coronavirus is racist due to African Americans not
[3:55:45.280 --> 3:55:49.080]  being able to wear them over fears they will be treated like criminals so
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:54.400]  basically they're saying because the site of black people wearing masks
[3:55:54.400 --> 3:55:58.480]  reminds people of criminals that they're going to be treating black people
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:02.760]  wearing masks to protect themselves against coronavirus as criminals and
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:09.600]  that this will lead to discrimination and in fact CNN in this article they
[3:56:09.600 --> 3:56:15.000]  quote a guy called a professor called Trevor Logan economic economics
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:18.880]  professor at Ohio State University who said he's not going to be following the
[3:56:18.880 --> 3:56:22.680]  guidance to wear a face mask because he says quote we have a lot of examples of
[3:56:22.680 --> 3:56:27.320]  the presumed criminality of black men in general that's according to mr. Logan
[3:56:27.320 --> 3:56:32.800]  which sounds pretty racist to me this is the supposition that because you see a
[3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:37.120]  black person wearing a mask you expect them to be about to commit a crime
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:43.000]  that's very racist ignoring FBI crime statistics so for CNN to even publish
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:47.600]  that to even plan that suggestion in people's minds is incredibly hateful
[3:56:47.600 --> 3:56:52.840]  and bigoted meanwhile OANN barred from White House press briefings but Chinese
[3:56:52.840 --> 3:56:58.560]  propaganda outlet allowed in of course a couple of weeks ago OANN which is an
[3:56:58.560 --> 3:57:04.000]  American owned media corporation vaguely pro-trump the only one that is
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:07.760]  apart from Fox News banned from the White House press room because they dared
[3:57:07.760 --> 3:57:12.880]  to ask a question of Trump that was not antagonistic we can't have that they
[3:57:12.880 --> 3:57:19.600]  were banned but the Chinese propaganda news network Hong Kong Phoenix TV which
[3:57:19.600 --> 3:57:23.920]  is I document in this article is basically a state media Communist Party
[3:57:23.920 --> 3:57:28.520]  propaganda mouthpiece and this woman reporting for them yesterday they're
[3:57:28.520 --> 3:57:33.360]  allowed in the White House OANN an American media company owned by an
[3:57:33.360 --> 3:57:37.760]  American family they're now barred from the White House because God forbid they
[3:57:37.760 --> 3:58:04.520]  were vaguely pro-trump I'll go away warrants coming up we'll be back
