[00:00.000 --> 00:11.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.240 --> 00:18.800]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.800 --> 00:32.040]  Texas Alex Jones I have a declaration to make on this Monday the second day of
[00:32.040 --> 00:40.480]  November 2009 this radio broadcast my news websites the films I make we're all
[00:40.480 --> 00:47.360]  taking it to a new level because the fight for Western civilization the fight
[00:47.360 --> 00:52.040]  for liberty and freedom is intensifying the global government is openly
[00:52.040 --> 00:59.000]  spreading its wings over this planet bringing in bondage and tyranny and
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  control it is true evil and oppression that we face the likes of which this
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.440]  planet has never seen and this planet has witnessed a lot of corruption and
[01:10.440 --> 01:17.200]  murder and evil but the realization has really hit me between the eyes as of late
[01:17.200 --> 01:27.600]  that we are facing a scientifically focused hyper aggressive hyper competitive
[01:27.600 --> 01:33.640]  aberrant group of individuals the priest of power as they call themselves and
[01:33.640 --> 01:38.400]  that they are not going to give humanity any quarter and their operations
[01:38.400 --> 01:43.800]  against humanity are intensifying on every front and almost every TV show I
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.360]  see every film I see almost the entire culture is now controlled by these
[01:48.360 --> 01:54.600]  people and it just blows my mind we have a huge very important broadcast today
[01:54.600 --> 01:56.920]  and I'm going to break down all the news and information we're going to be
[01:56.920 --> 02:04.040]  covering after the first break but I talk a lot about when I'm on the treadmill
[02:04.040 --> 02:07.040]  in the morning because when I'm on the treadmill for 45 minutes to an hour
[02:07.040 --> 02:13.720]  jogging I watch the news or I watch television shows or I watch movies kind
[02:13.720 --> 02:19.360]  of a mix of all three and I learn so much more watching television in movies
[02:19.360 --> 02:23.640]  and I even do reading government documents in the news because the news is
[02:23.640 --> 02:28.600]  tailored to that select group that are even focused and it's full of spin and
[02:28.600 --> 02:33.600]  lies and propaganda but where the real bombardment of evils going on is in
[02:33.600 --> 02:41.840]  sports and in movies and in dramas and sitcoms I watched an hour this morning
[02:41.840 --> 02:50.560]  of Transformers revenge of the fallen and the message was torture is good
[02:50.560 --> 02:58.760]  conspiracy theorists are bad the military is good nanotech and drones are
[02:58.760 --> 03:05.160]  a regular part of life the national security dictatorship is good and the
[03:05.160 --> 03:12.000]  program dumbed down the language it assaulted the family it was all pure
[03:12.000 --> 03:22.920]  brainwashing and an attempt to sell evil as good the heroin the the the the
[03:22.920 --> 03:29.240]  brunette bombshell tortures a little robot who's evil but has a sweet child
[03:29.240 --> 03:36.440]  like demeanor big eyes and the message was he even kind of liked being tortured
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.840]  it was cute and funny as she burned his eyes out with a blowtorch and that was
[03:41.840 --> 03:45.800]  written so that when you see fellow humans being killed and tortured you'll
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.240]  think it's cute and funny just like 24 and all these other shows but just to
[03:49.240 --> 03:56.560]  that was just one message that torture is good and that dead babies are good
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.160]  there's multiple scenes where they're trying to grow new decepticons and the
[04:01.160 --> 04:06.480]  babies die and it's kind of funny as they come dying crawling out of their
[04:06.480 --> 04:12.080]  wombs just everything is eugenics and death and it really hits me just how
[04:12.080 --> 04:22.360]  black our enemy is just how right out of the pit of hell and then I had the
[04:22.360 --> 04:26.080]  realization of just how important this radio show is and everything I do is
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.800]  and I want everybody to understand I've grown up now I've still got bad habits
[04:30.800 --> 04:34.600]  I've got a break and this will be a transformation to take some time but I
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.240]  am born again hard as they say and I'm going to the next level with your help
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.920]  we're all going to the next level but you're gonna see a lot of changes on this
[04:43.920 --> 04:48.000]  radio broadcast you're gonna see more of what's been good and powerful about it
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.920]  and less of what hasn't been I'm gonna be a lot more serious and a lot more
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.160]  focused and I'm not going to be lazy I'm gonna really break down on my

[09:39.520 --> 09:48.160]  be free in other parts of the planet as the long shadows of tyranny descend upon
[09:48.160 --> 09:53.400]  our republic that we have listeners in every town and city and county of the
[09:53.400 --> 09:59.720]  United States and we have listeners across the world several months ago we
[09:59.720 --> 10:04.360]  began to get calls from parents saying their children had been injected all
[10:04.360 --> 10:08.160]  over the country they would name the names of the schools the schools would
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.320]  say your elementary school student is lying they would go down to the school
[10:12.320 --> 10:16.800]  and find other parents in some of the cases already in the nurses office with
[10:16.800 --> 10:20.920]  their children saying that they were injected with a regular seasonal flu
[10:20.920 --> 10:27.880]  vaccine or forcibly in the last month given the nasal H1N1 live virus
[10:27.880 --> 10:34.920]  vaccine since then in the last week and a half we've seen mainstream media
[10:34.920 --> 10:41.200]  reporting it in California Oregon Texas Kentucky New York over the weekend and
[10:41.200 --> 10:50.080]  now today we've gone from a handful of confirmed press reports to scores scores
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.080]  I know I put it off more than 10 this morning we have a lot of them linked up
[10:54.080 --> 11:00.000]  on info wars.com and prison planet.com they're following the same talking
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.120]  points at all of these public schools which confirms this is being done by
[11:06.120 --> 11:13.560]  design and this is even more criminal and more organized and concerted this is
[11:13.560 --> 11:19.000]  racketeering medical tyranny racketeering medical oppression racketeering
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.280]  this is even worse than I thought they would be at this stage every indicator
[11:25.280 --> 11:31.680]  I've got ladies and gentlemen is the government is completely bankrupt
[11:31.680 --> 11:37.080]  morally is completely corrupt and is becoming more arrogant and more
[11:37.080 --> 11:44.040]  aggressive every single day and that's what's been hitting me intellectually as
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.120]  I coldly sit here and analyze all this information I spend hours and hours
[11:48.120 --> 11:53.000]  every day and then I get up on air and I'm like where do I start this is just
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.600]  it makes my head spin now we're only finding out about the cases across the
[11:58.600 --> 12:04.040]  United States where children go to the hospital this is not psychosomatic it's
[12:04.040 --> 12:09.040]  not placebo they're given the nasal they're given the seasonal they're
[12:09.040 --> 12:13.760]  given the H1N1 injectable and they get sick they pass out they have
[12:13.760 --> 12:31.600]  convulsions they have seizures now the media covers this up and spends it in
[12:31.600 --> 12:39.920]  most cases so if we've seen conservatively I haven't done a tally but I
[12:39.920 --> 12:46.880]  know if it's 10 articles or more I've seen today probably 20 articles 20 new
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.120]  stories we played quite a few of the local news clips here on air you can be
[12:52.120 --> 12:57.480]  assured it is thousands of times that and we've have all these phone calls
[12:57.480 --> 13:10.880]  previously previously on air where it's happening to parents so what I need you
[13:10.880 --> 13:21.920]  as parents to do is to email me now again the problem is we don't have a lot
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.440]  of staff so the problem is we have to wade through all the spam I'm not
[13:26.440 --> 13:33.800]  complaining but we need you to email Aaron at info wars.com we need you to
[13:33.800 --> 13:41.520]  email show tips at info wars.com you need to name the school where it is if
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.560]  you want your name that's how you beat tyranny's coming out in the light but if
[13:45.560 --> 13:49.920]  you don't want to don't have to put it and what happened at the school and how
[13:49.920 --> 13:56.720]  they injected your child because this has been going on for more than two
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.040]  months and and it was confirmed I mean I've gotten all these phone calls where
[14:02.040 --> 14:06.000]  parents have listed the school and and and where it happened but but I need
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.680]  really a public affidavit from you can send it to writers and info wars.com
[14:10.680 --> 14:16.280]  and we'll either put it into articles we write as a composite or we'll post your
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.920]  statements because this is a concerted effort and and and and now all these
[14:21.920 --> 14:26.720]  phone calls we've gotten on and off air and all the emails are confirmed and we
[14:26.720 --> 14:30.840]  need to see criminal charges against these schools you see the federal
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.400]  government is ordering them to do this through FEMA and through the county and
[14:34.400 --> 14:36.480]  city health departments that are controlled by the federal government
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.600]  and if they're able to set the precedent to line your children up and inject them
[14:41.600 --> 14:48.960]  even when you've been to the school and told them not to if we allow this to
[14:48.960 --> 14:52.720]  stand a precedent is set and and that's what the establishment does they
[14:52.720 --> 14:56.560]  squeeze us and take two or three steps forward we push them back a foot and a
[14:56.560 --> 15:01.920]  half but still they've gained ground on us they take five steps we push them
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.360]  back three they take ten steps we push them back seven they're still moving in
[15:06.360 --> 15:12.360]  on us and there's so many facets to this I mean what type of illegitimate
[15:12.360 --> 15:17.000]  criminal government injects the children and doesn't care if it's illegal and
[15:17.000 --> 15:25.560]  then the talking point is out there of just say it was an accident and all the
[15:25.560 --> 15:30.000]  cases I've read about over the years in mainstream media and the news usually
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.720]  spins it like it was a good thing where nurses and doctors take your baby away
[15:33.720 --> 15:37.680]  to wash it when it's a newborn and you've said no don't inject my child and
[15:37.680 --> 15:42.080]  they still inject your child all these vaccines or how we've confirmed and
[15:42.080 --> 15:46.040]  people have won in court where they give your toddler its third round of shots
[15:46.040 --> 15:51.600]  they have a convulsion there's blood on the brain from the brain swelling the
[15:51.600 --> 15:55.360]  doctors know that but to protect themselves from liability when you come
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.640]  in and your child gets an x-ray or a CAT scan they see as your child and arrest
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.880]  you and indict you for slamming your child's head in the wall when these
[16:03.880 --> 16:11.280]  bastards know they brain damaged your child so the lucky parents are the
[16:11.280 --> 16:15.920]  ones where the child collapses in the school or collapses at the clinic or at
[16:15.920 --> 16:19.840]  the hospital because then the bastards have to admit what they've done to you
[16:19.840 --> 16:25.440]  and the FDA admits it's doing this to people but then separately you have the
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.080]  federal government the big drug makers the New York Times and others doing
[16:29.080 --> 16:32.720]  different school programs and college programs where they hand out to the
[16:32.720 --> 16:38.520]  children and their parents these fact sheets telling them there is no mercury
[16:38.520 --> 16:41.920]  it can't cause neurological disorders it can't sterilize you it can't cause
[16:41.920 --> 16:47.760]  cancer it can't cause any neurological issues or autoimmune disorders when the
[16:47.760 --> 16:54.120]  inserts of the stinking vaccine say it we need to have this head home and get
[16:54.120 --> 17:01.040]  angry and not just accept the criminal activities of this government and this
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.720]  is a global operation this is happening in England I was driving in this morning
[17:04.720 --> 17:10.400]  listening to local radio and I heard Fox News report oh people don't trust the
[17:10.400 --> 17:15.000]  government saying the flu shots are safe so the government has appointed an
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.520]  independent group who will meet in secret and who will then come out and
[17:18.520 --> 17:21.640]  explain to the public that they didn't get sick from the flu shots they just
[17:21.640 --> 17:27.200]  think they did remember Reuters a month ago wrote that big article the owner of
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.400]  Reuters is tied in with the Bilderberg group and with the vaccine makers we've
[17:30.400 --> 17:40.360]  posted articles about that saying oh yes millions are gonna die but millions
[17:40.360 --> 17:45.560]  normally die of convulsions and heart attacks and autoimmune disorders and so
[17:45.560 --> 17:48.600]  just because you take the shot and die or get sick doesn't mean it was that so
[17:48.600 --> 17:53.880]  they're preemptively saying oh this you know you weren't hurt by your shot before
[17:53.880 --> 17:57.480]  a doctor even sees you and telling the doctors for your liability you better
[17:57.480 --> 18:03.680]  say this but it's backfired that's why more than half the doctors in the US and
[18:03.680 --> 18:09.160]  in England and in Canada the press is reporting won't give the shot doctors
[18:09.160 --> 18:12.760]  aren't stupid they know that the inserts say it can do this and then they get
[18:12.760 --> 18:16.520]  letters saying we'll tell people it can't the doctors go wait this is a
[18:16.520 --> 18:21.520]  criminal conspiracy you're telling me get my story straight I mean ladies and
[18:21.520 --> 18:24.600]  gentlemen if the government's doing all this what else are they doing well the
[18:24.600 --> 18:30.680]  answer is the sky's the limit on every issue every front these people are
[18:30.680 --> 18:37.440]  completely and totally out of control government appoints task force to handle
[18:37.440 --> 18:42.280]  h1n1 vaccine propaganda Paul Watson's written an article the US government is
[18:42.280 --> 18:46.200]  appointed what the media is ludicrously building as an independent group of

[36:17.960 --> 36:21.680]  more into evil you'll suddenly get fulfilled you were unfulfilled because
[36:21.680 --> 36:26.600]  you aren't following your true destiny to be informed and enlightened and to
[36:26.600 --> 36:32.400]  stand in the breach against corruption I am so alive I can hardly stand it I'm
[36:32.400 --> 36:37.960]  so fulfilled and I see these other zombie like unhappy people who've been
[36:37.960 --> 36:46.280]  given petty power and in good looks or who are obsessed with petty issues
[36:46.280 --> 36:51.760]  completely empty and I just wish you'd awaken and be filled with goodness
[36:51.760 --> 36:55.760]  because the moment you took the blinders off your eyes you begin to see what was
[36:55.760 --> 37:00.320]  around you let me tell you I've drilled deeply into this new world order I have
[37:00.320 --> 37:04.960]  studied their secrets I've studied their systems and it is an art form that we
[37:04.960 --> 37:12.960]  face and I wish you could see what I see I wish you knew what I knew because you
[37:12.960 --> 37:17.080]  wouldn't wait 10 seconds and screaming bloody murder and warning everyone you
[37:17.080 --> 37:21.000]  know and running up and down the streets pulling your hair out to get your
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.960]  fellow humans to awaken but you've been slowly marinated in the evil slowly
[37:26.960 --> 37:33.160]  marinated in the eugenics slowly marinated in the psych warfare to where
[37:33.160 --> 37:37.680]  now legions of crimes and criminal operations that were beta tested in the
[37:37.680 --> 37:42.000]  past you thought the beta test of all this different forms of corruption and
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.440]  dehumanization was bad it was all just a test the real operation started in the
[37:48.440 --> 37:55.600]  last six months and it's only gonna intensify the war is on and you didn't
[37:55.600 --> 37:59.320]  know there was a war on for your mind you didn't know this was the real deal
[37:59.320 --> 38:06.280]  it is and a lot of us don't have a chance surviving psychologically
[38:06.280 --> 38:10.600]  spiritually financially mentally even when we're fully aware of what's going
[38:10.600 --> 38:15.280]  on those of you that think your denial is cute and wear it like a cloak of
[38:15.280 --> 38:21.840]  invulnerability the truth is you got your butt sticking up above the weeds and
[38:21.840 --> 38:27.480]  you're the prime target just because you tell yourself this isn't real or isn't
[38:27.480 --> 38:35.200]  true doesn't make it all go away do you understand me I want everybody to count
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.280]  the cost I want everybody to realize because in the last few days I've read
[38:40.280 --> 38:45.160]  this framework convention on climate change and I lazily at a subconscious
[38:45.160 --> 38:49.200]  level don't even want to do the hour broadcast covering it it's painful just
[38:49.200 --> 38:53.880]  to read it much less analyze it break it down for people it's so horrible it's
[38:53.880 --> 39:04.240]  so insulting it's so big it's so corrupt it's certified tyranny it'd be like
[39:04.240 --> 39:08.520]  hearing a knock at the door at 1 a.m. and opening it up and there's a zombie
[39:08.520 --> 39:12.720]  with green slime coming out its eyes and blood dripping from its mouth and you
[39:12.720 --> 39:17.240]  don't even get scared you just open the door and invite it on in this thing for
[39:17.240 --> 39:25.120]  anyone that has a seventh-grade education on history is absolute murder it is
[39:25.120 --> 39:33.520]  absolute pit of hell evil sophisticated genius wicked multifaceted
[39:33.520 --> 39:39.720]  unbelief I mean if you fully charge up to fight it and fully integrate and stand
[39:39.720 --> 39:46.160]  up against this thing it's hard to be but you sit there giggling and smiling and
[39:46.160 --> 39:50.600]  laughing totally mesmerized by the deaf culture you're going to be completely
[39:50.600 --> 39:56.480]  devoured you think you're safe in bracing this thing the only chance we've
[39:56.480 --> 40:02.440]  got to dig in and fight this 110% and that's going to become more evident to
[40:02.440 --> 40:07.480]  you in the years to come as they break the back of this nation as they gun
[40:07.480 --> 40:12.040]  people down in public on television to sell you that it's okay as they turn
[40:12.040 --> 40:16.080]  criminal police loose on the population and run the final good officers out of
[40:16.080 --> 40:21.440]  the forces you just get ready because it's going to make what Alexander
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.040]  Schultz and Nietzsche and witnessed look tame in comparison alright I said I'm
[40:25.040 --> 40:29.560]  going to your whistleblower calls right now Andy Alex Mike Chris Roger and
[40:29.560 --> 40:35.960]  others whistleblowers on the flu Andy and Georgia you're on the air oh hi Alex
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.560]  I was just listening to you and I'm listening about the H1N1 and it is
[40:41.560 --> 40:47.040]  really a corrupt situation going on right now and they said in the news
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.920]  that more people have died since the vaccination has been going on then the
[40:51.920 --> 40:57.640]  swine flu itself I heard that on the news and it's actually I just think it's a
[40:57.640 --> 41:05.120]  very corrupt situation and my my uncle had gotten the vaccination and he is
[41:05.120 --> 41:10.760]  he's he got the swine flu and it's very it's very very corrupt he gets a nasal
[41:10.760 --> 41:16.360]  because the insert admits it gives a large portion of people the flu and then
[41:16.360 --> 41:20.960]  allows them to see how genius that is and how openly evil who would be so bold
[41:20.960 --> 41:25.560]  as to put out a live virus vaccine that breeds in the nasal passage that
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.920]  sneezed all over everyone these idiots think they're getting protection they
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.320]  get people sick around them get themselves sick in many cases and then the
[41:34.320 --> 41:39.880]  actual pandemic starts and then they inject people with a really bad shot
[41:39.880 --> 41:45.480]  yeah it's it's frankly to me it's retarded and you go to hear from you
[41:45.480 --> 41:53.000]  let's talk to Alex in Texas Alex you're on the air hello yes hi Alex I'm an
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.760]  RN for deceit and health care system here in Austin Texas I was recently
[41:56.760 --> 42:02.360]  threatened with firing from my job for not getting the flu shot providing that
[42:02.360 --> 42:07.440]  if you refuse to wear a mask if you refuse to get the flu shot you have to
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.080]  wear a mask if you're caught without the mask on while you're working you can be
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.440]  fought well why not just a yellow star see they're setting the precedent that
[42:16.440 --> 42:21.040]  that you're bad you're evil you have it when a month ago they reported the CDC
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.200]  37% of the public's infected with it there's thousands of viruses every year
[42:26.200 --> 42:30.640]  that we all get that don't hurt us and this is totally made up well I got even
[42:30.640 --> 42:35.480]  more interesting because my clinical manager is a male nurse like myself and
[42:35.480 --> 42:39.240]  we got into a big argument in front of everybody in front of the chief operating
[42:39.240 --> 42:44.960]  officer and I lectured him about squalene bimerosal aluminum even they
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.880]  they're using I think parts of cornea now from dead aborted babies and I said
[42:49.880 --> 42:54.960]  this is a Catholic hospital why are we allowing this and his response was you
[42:54.960 --> 42:59.000]  should listen to what the CDC says and what the Pope says the Pope says that
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.240]  even though it has aborted parts in the vaccine we still have to take it as
[43:04.240 --> 43:09.120]  healthcare providers and then he went on to say if I catch you without the mask
[43:09.120 --> 43:12.840]  you're fired I'm also going to report you to the board of nursing examiners for
[43:12.840 --> 43:20.800]  not being safe not exposing safety to the general public so in addition to
[43:20.800 --> 43:24.760]  being fired he was threatening to remove my license as well and he said that in
[43:24.760 --> 43:29.200]  front of everybody and then they set the precedent to force you to do it and
[43:29.200 --> 43:33.480]  then next they can make you take any number of vaccines so what are you going
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.920]  to do well I followed dr. Blair brought dr. Russell Blaylock I think you had him
[43:37.920 --> 43:43.480]  on your show yes yes I followed his 15 steps and I actually for the flu shot I
[43:43.480 --> 43:48.560]  did very very good I didn't have any problems however a lot of the nurses who
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.680]  and a lot of them were quite angry about it because none of they they were
[43:52.680 --> 43:57.000]  wondering why are we forced to do this I've always refused and I've never had
[43:57.000 --> 44:03.060]  any problems but I calculated 50 to 75 percent of the nurses who took the
[44:03.060 --> 44:08.080]  regular seasonal flu shot for this year 50 to 75 percent of my didn't get an
[44:08.080 --> 44:13.520]  exact figure called in sick and they all said it was the flu shot so the flu
[44:13.520 --> 44:20.080]  shot if anything caused a loss of man hours as opposed to preventing a loss of
[44:20.080 --> 44:24.340]  man hours so well it was a useless stupid argument that's eaten the
[44:24.340 --> 44:28.920]  seat medical what's happening is they're testing forced inoculation they're
[44:28.920 --> 44:36.160]  trying to set the precedent and any mandated you in shot whether it's
[44:36.160 --> 44:45.880]  smallpox polio hepatitis tetanus the UN has been caught adding sterilants to it
[44:45.880 --> 44:51.280]  in mainstream news in the mid 1990s they got caught this year with live polio
[44:51.280 --> 44:56.040]  giving people polio in the vaccine CBS News Associated Press for anybody that
[44:56.040 --> 45:02.040]  wants to look that up and they are setting up a medical tyranny under the
[45:02.040 --> 45:05.480]  executive orders they can force the public to take it but they're trying to
[45:05.480 --> 45:10.720]  force medical workers to do it first so this year or next year or two years from
[45:10.720 --> 45:15.240]  now they can have the quarantines and lockdowns and use that as the cover for
[45:15.240 --> 45:20.440]  martial law it's the perfect cover because it makes everyone a suspect many
[45:20.440 --> 45:23.640]  states including Texas of past laws where you've got to wear bracelets during
[45:23.640 --> 45:29.920]  emergencies that's now on record this is completely diabolical being run by the
[45:29.920 --> 45:35.760]  United Nations I know that the doctors and military and government officials
[45:35.760 --> 45:39.960]  in Germany are given a special shot that's now in Time Magazine by the way
[45:39.960 --> 45:47.040]  for those in denial there is no doubt that something special is in that flu
[45:47.040 --> 45:54.360]  shot that H1N1 and God help us but you're saying well I mean isn't this a
[45:54.360 --> 45:59.400]  wake-up call for the nurses if over half of them got sick we see another thing
[45:59.400 --> 46:03.960]  yes it is but another problem like in New York New York Bravo to the nurses of
[46:03.960 --> 46:08.680]  New York for standing up like that but they have a union and I sort of think
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.760]  the reason I mean Texas is a right to work state I sort of think the reason
[46:12.760 --> 46:16.080]  they were bullying us like that was because we don't have a union I mean
[46:16.080 --> 46:20.880]  that's my own gut feeling I've never worked well but I've been that's my own
[46:20.880 --> 46:25.160]  gut feeling I guess now now a lot of the hospitals are trying to force seasonal
[46:25.160 --> 46:29.280]  and H1N1 are they trying to force both on you no they're having problems with
[46:29.280 --> 46:35.160]  the H1N1 and and I think that's that's gonna be another hurdle for at least
[46:35.160 --> 46:38.600]  for seat and healthcare system here in Austin's gonna probably have to go
[46:38.600 --> 46:45.400]  through because originally Seaton's position was they didn't want the H1N1
[46:45.400 --> 46:51.440]  because they were fearful of lawsuits and the chief executive for the Seaton
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.880]  system here in Austin stated that and then about three or maybe I think it's
[46:55.880 --> 47:00.880]  like a one a month later he did a 180 degree turn and said everyone must take
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.280]  the H1N1 and I'm thinking either the government for threatened them with
[47:05.280 --> 47:09.360]  removal of funds or someone threatened them because originally you rolled up
[47:09.360 --> 47:13.840]  your sleeve to keep your job your livelihood this is slavery they said
[47:13.840 --> 47:17.480]  you let us do this medical procedure on you or you lose your job and you roll
[47:17.480 --> 47:20.720]  the sleeve up and you took and your license that's what I was told you
[47:20.720 --> 47:23.560]  would you lose your job and I'll recommend you to the board of nursing
[47:23.560 --> 47:27.880]  examiner here in Austin to have your license removed land of the free home
[47:27.880 --> 47:30.600]  of the brave see they're setting the precedent they could never do this
[47:30.600 --> 47:34.720]  before and this is all color of law with Obama up on TV saying you don't have to
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.360]  do it God bless you and I appreciate your call Alex that's just a horrible
[47:38.360 --> 47:43.240]  story but it's going on I mean they're injecting public school children notice
[47:43.240 --> 47:47.400]  it's all elementary because that they're injecting most people's elementary
[47:47.400 --> 47:50.880]  students we've confirmed that's going on and it's the few that collapse and have
[47:50.880 --> 47:54.280]  convulsions and the parents say what happened and they say well we gave them
[47:54.280 --> 47:58.960]  a shot well I told you not to give them a shot well we did it's an accident
[47:58.960 --> 48:05.680]  oops here's the headline public school nurses give swine flu vaccine to kids
[48:05.680 --> 48:09.800]  without parents okay since child the hospital another headline another city
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.080]  student gets flu vaccine by mistake Department of Education officials
[48:14.080 --> 48:23.240]  statement and I've got headline after headline after headline saying the same
[48:23.240 --> 48:29.120]  thing here from New York Daily News Associated Press you name it that's the
[48:29.120 --> 48:35.640]  system we live in and notice before they tried this force in
[48:35.640 --> 48:39.880]  population with a smallpox with 14 million first responders firemen police
[48:39.880 --> 48:47.200]  medical workers county workers federal workers in 2000 and two 2003 and the LA
[48:47.200 --> 48:52.240]  Times reported only 4,000 took it and over a hundred died mainly from heart
[48:52.240 --> 48:57.400]  attacks it caused an autoimmune response in the heart and then remember Tommy
[48:57.400 --> 49:00.400]  Thompson wouldn't take it and that was it it got suspended this time they don't
[49:00.400 --> 49:03.680]  care see and that's the issue they don't care if you don't want to amnesty
[49:03.680 --> 49:06.440]  they're gonna pass it they don't care if you don't want to hate crimes bill
[49:06.440 --> 49:09.760]  federalization they're past it they don't care if you don't want the Copenhagen
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.640]  world government treaty that says world government they're gonna do it they
[49:13.640 --> 49:17.280]  don't care if you don't want Obama to expand the wars he's gonna do it they
[49:17.280 --> 49:20.240]  don't care if you don't want the NSA violating the fourth amendment taken over
[49:20.240 --> 49:25.200]  the internet and openly saying they may shut it down they're gonna do it they
[49:25.200 --> 49:30.760]  don't care anymore they've been told do it and the systems told the police and
[49:30.760 --> 49:35.600]  the doctors and all the enforcers you do it or you're fired you understand they
[49:35.600 --> 49:41.040]  are testing you they are testing you for real martial law and the martial law is
[49:41.040 --> 49:45.400]  going to be medical probably not this year maybe not even next year but this is
[49:45.400 --> 49:50.840]  all a test and it's not going well for them but it is going well people are
[49:50.840 --> 49:55.400]  resisting at record levels but they don't care they're forcing it through and
[49:55.400 --> 49:59.480]  down and if they are able to do this it's an even bigger victory for them that
[49:59.480 --> 50:06.000]  they got resistance and they're still forcing it I'm telling you every one
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.960]  of you listening if we don't have a revolution of understanding and
[50:08.960 --> 50:12.920]  awakening in this country you're going to be boarded up in your homes in the
[50:12.920 --> 50:18.320]  next few years and not allowed out unless you take the shot and then they're
[50:18.320 --> 50:22.120]  setting the precedent where people die and get hurt from it and still no one
[50:22.120 --> 50:25.880]  gets in trouble and it continues see they have to inject you with something
[50:25.880 --> 50:30.920]  that openly hurts you and they go well that's the price well you know we have
[50:30.920 --> 50:37.280]  to do it see it's all psychological warfare that's why they have hundreds
[50:37.280 --> 50:41.080]  of editorials and articles every week admitting world government and admitting
[50:41.080 --> 50:44.680]  everything you do is going to be tracked and traced and controlled and saying oh
[50:44.680 --> 50:48.040]  isn't it good your children are spying on you for the environment in all these
[50:48.040 --> 50:52.640]  publications they're telling you that evil's good on every TV show I see
[50:52.640 --> 50:59.400]  torture is now good they're turning us into them our entire atmosphere
[50:59.400 --> 51:02.720]  psychologically changing do you have trouble getting through the day do you

[52:15.120 --> 52:20.240]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[52:20.240 --> 52:25.600]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for

[54:18.920 --> 54:26.360]  me yeah it's Mike not Matt sorry just go ahead sir yes I'm calling from Canada
[54:26.360 --> 54:33.240]  we've like everywhere else we've had the warning and the fear mongering since
[54:33.240 --> 54:39.280]  summer I've been a listener in a prison planet TV member for a long time and I
[54:39.280 --> 54:45.080]  was giving out your information to a lot of people I work in the oil patch all
[54:45.080 --> 54:54.280]  over the world so I've been able to reach a lot of people and I've been
[54:54.280 --> 54:59.800]  it's showing the flu inserts even before you decided to put it out on the air
[54:59.800 --> 55:06.200]  because I've listened to you for a long time listening to Dr. Horowitz only one
[55:06.200 --> 55:11.600]  person where I work actually stood in line to get the flu shot that we've had
[55:11.600 --> 55:16.720]  highway backups it's been crazy they've been announcing that in Alberta where I
[55:16.720 --> 55:20.720]  live they have three million people they've had they've been saying since
[55:20.720 --> 55:25.920]  summer they have two million doses ready to go and they only did it for a week
[55:25.920 --> 55:31.400]  and all of a sudden they shut all the clinics down because there was traffic
[55:31.400 --> 55:37.480]  gridlock and everything else going on here and as far as I can find out
[55:37.480 --> 55:44.560]  nobody has actually been hurt from taking the shot and I'm just wondering
[55:44.560 --> 55:52.120]  what your take is on that out well number one that's the whole point rarely
[55:52.120 --> 55:55.760]  does the vaccine and it's all over the news people are going to the hospital
[55:55.760 --> 56:00.880]  from it headline public school nurses give swine flu vaccines to kids without
[56:00.880 --> 56:07.400]  parents okay since child the hospital people are collapsing and so you said
[56:07.400 --> 56:13.280]  that only one person you knew lined up and got it it is the aggregate effect
[56:13.280 --> 56:17.960]  you don't drink one glass of fluoride water and then it brain damages you it
[56:17.960 --> 56:23.120]  precipitates out in the bones we've had the top EPA scientist on who wants it
[56:23.120 --> 56:27.840]  removed people in the government know this stuff's bad and so it builds up
[56:27.840 --> 56:32.320]  that's why most autistic children you talk to talk to their parents it's at
[56:32.320 --> 56:37.800]  18 months the third round of shots the toddlers running around laughing talking
[56:37.800 --> 56:41.680]  they get the third round they have convulsions or don't get out of bed for
[56:41.680 --> 56:46.600]  three days and then their brain damaged and sitting in the corner for the rest
[56:46.600 --> 56:52.840]  of their life so that's how this works it's it's it's incremental and I can
[56:52.840 --> 57:01.000]  pull up London Telegraph 21 people die in bird flu trial in Poland alone out of
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.680]  a hundred that were given quote an experimental shot I mean the wreckage
[57:04.680 --> 57:09.640]  from this but yes most people that take it aren't going to immediately get sick
[57:09.640 --> 57:13.320]  though you heard the nurse earlier saying more than 50% of the nurses that
[57:13.320 --> 57:17.640]  were forced to take it at Seton here locally got sick and they should go to
[57:17.640 --> 57:21.600]  the newspaper and they should make a big deal out of it then they're superiors
[57:21.600 --> 57:28.320]  the authorities the officials our gods will back up and we'll back off I
[57:28.320 --> 57:32.640]  appreciate your call Mike let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Ohio Chris go
[57:32.640 --> 57:38.000]  ahead hey brother God bless you I used to work in a doctor's office in Columbus
[57:38.000 --> 57:43.560]  Ohio back in March late March the Columbus Medical Association and Mary
[57:43.560 --> 57:48.520]  Joe Kilroy our state representative up here came down and said that there would
[57:48.520 --> 57:53.560]  be a pandemic within the next few years and this was like three or four weeks
[57:53.560 --> 57:59.280]  before the swine flu outbreak so they offered all the Columbus area doctors
[57:59.280 --> 58:04.480]  offices the opportunity to be a pandemic response center and these offices would
[58:04.480 --> 58:09.120]  get lots of federal funding basically in the midst of all this outbreak they
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.960]  kept in you know incentivizing all the stuff that you know all these offices
[58:13.960 --> 58:19.160]  would get and everything so and our office manager Jenny said that she
[58:19.160 --> 58:24.000]  received a huge stack of papers the emphasize that they were expecting a
[58:24.000 --> 58:28.920]  pandemic I saw all this paperwork kind of freaky and it happened probably I'd
[58:28.920 --> 58:34.680]  say three weeks prior to the actual outbreak in America yeah stay there we
[58:34.680 --> 58:38.680]  confirmed this as well back in January they were already getting everybody
[58:38.680 --> 58:45.040]  ready America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a
[58:45.040 --> 58:52.000]  decade we are the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[58:52.000 --> 58:55.960]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[58:55.960 --> 58:59.760]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[58:59.760 --> 59:03.680]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[59:03.680 --> 59:08.080]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[59:08.080 --> 59:12.520]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[59:12.520 --> 59:17.280]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.280 --> 59:21.080]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[59:21.080 --> 59:24.680]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:24.680 --> 59:29.080]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.080 --> 59:32.200]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[59:32.200 --> 59:35.880]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[59:35.880 --> 59:40.680]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[59:40.680 --> 59:45.680]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[59:45.680 --> 59:51.200]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:52.520 --> 1:00:00.320]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:11.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:19.480]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:26.600]  Alex Jones now into our number two continuing with flu whistleblowers
[1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:31.600]  will be taking your calls when Bill Sardy health journalist joins us to give
[1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:36.680]  us his take on the flu the hype the adverse reactions but Chris just brought
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:41.320]  up a key point and we need these people to write articles to go public and a
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:47.000]  doctor's office he worked in the health manager there weeks and weeks before the
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:52.200]  fear even started in April in March and this is what we confirmed back in
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:56.120]  January and February remember I did all those radio shows we wrote articles
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:02.400]  we've reposted them saying something big with the flu is coming up they're
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:05.320]  getting ready for mass graves they're telling local cities get ready for
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:10.560]  martial law we had emergency managers on the state of New York got all their
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:16.160]  cemeteries ready how would they know this deadly flu which isn't deadly like
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:19.320]  they say for most people it's weak it can kill you but weak compared to the
[1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:23.840]  seasonal how did they know it was gonna be so big months and months and months
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:27.080]  before it even popped up in Mexico and then that was a non-event but they
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:31.320]  hyped it and created fear and all the mask and then the UN came in and put us
[1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:34.720]  under level six and we got those documents in late April months two
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:40.080]  months before that was made public so yes we know the feds were going around
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:44.600]  federalizing everything and whether the flu was dangerous or not or whether
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:48.000]  they forcibly inoculate people or not which they are doing the public school
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.880]  children just a huge issue we just calmly report it we almost do their dirty
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:56.400]  work for them when I just calmly oh yeah they're forcibly injecting people and
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:59.840]  see we just get conditioned and nobody goes to jail nobody gets in trouble for
[1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:04.320]  committing these crimes and then we hear caller after caller before this was
[1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:08.960]  even in the news that they were forcibly injecting kids now it's confirmed who
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:12.080]  could believe it before it was so shocking but when it's admitted oh no
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:18.800]  big deal that yes they were telling the medical facilities get ready it's gonna
[1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:24.400]  be huge even before April because something this big that staged has to be
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:30.560]  geared up beforehand it's like 44,000 US troops 18,000 British troops masked in
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:36.240]  Tajikistan Uzbekistan Pakistan and other areas around Afghanistan before 9 11
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:40.640]  and then two weeks after 9 11 all the military forces start attacking they
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:43.360]  were already masked and ready and it turned out Bush signed the order to
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:49.120]  attack September 10th that's how you know this stuff the stage ladies and
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:54.160]  gentlemen finish up what you were going to say Chris I thought the the most odd
[1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:58.320]  aspect of this whole thing was how they were going to be put on this payroll as
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:03.120]  soon as it's all broke out and basically they were incorporating all these
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:09.760]  positions offices into places like the central Ohio trauma system all these
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:13.760]  outside federally funded programs and this was much more than just the flu it
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:18.720]  had more to do with um it had to do with hurricanes tornadoes flu
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:22.880]  outages and it says other possibilities it's been the actual document says or
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:26.080]  other possibilities kind of hinting at you know
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:30.320]  martial law we may need you to actually work in a conjunction
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:34.480]  with our um you know uh with our jackboots dogs on the streets you know
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:38.080]  we're sorry it's the same thing with the clergy response teams four years ago we
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:42.160]  got the secret documents almost five two years later it became mainstream news
[1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:47.760]  they said forced inoculation lockdowns fema camps gun confiscation they're
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:52.000]  getting the doctors and infrastructure personnel ready for
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:56.400]  martial law that is confirmed sir yeah and it's a it's a total you're right
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:59.680]  it's a total incorporation they're trying to get everybody on the same page
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:02.800]  and they're trying to get everybody to think that if you know i'm getting paid
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:06.640]  for this um who really cares what's happening to the average person on the
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:09.200]  street you know and i think that's one of the most uh
[1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:12.640]  i guess despicable despicable aspects about this whole thing is we're trying
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:16.560]  to get everybody just exactly how did the globalist take over iraq
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:20.080]  payoffs they paid off most the republican guard
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:26.560]  in the six months before the 2003 invasion it's all staged sir
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:30.640]  right that's right i was actually a uh a marine for a couple years and
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:33.920]  that's kind of how i actually got turned on to your show was you mentioned that
[1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:37.280]  we uh i worked at a prison prison outfit and
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:41.200]  you mentioned that um uh we were out actually
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:45.840]  taking some of the tainies and giving them to uh to other countries and
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:49.600]  um other than your show i'd never heard anybody mention that
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:52.800]  and you really you really open my eyes and it really disturbed me and at the
[1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:57.360]  same time it it opened my eye and i finally woke up and so that's why
[1:04:57.360 --> 1:05:01.520]  and now it's all admitted god bless you sir now they have heard that millionaire
[1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:04.560]  entrepreneur businessman your congressional candidate and

[1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:32.320]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:34.800]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:38.640]  tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:42.080]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:45.520]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:03.120]  hey folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about oxy silver the world's
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:07.040]  most advanced silver hydrosol that dr horowitz says can make risky
[1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:09.520]  vaccines and antibiotics avoidable you've heard dr lennard
[1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:12.080]  horowitz and others urds vaccination avoidance
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:16.880]  instead use vitamin cd and oxy silver along with zeolife for broad spectrum
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:20.320]  detoxification using nasa science oxy silver is nano
[1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:25.280]  silver covalently bonded to water oxy silver safely electrocutes pathogens
[1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:29.520]  oxygenates for faster healing then delivers a 528 hertz frequency
[1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:32.640]  homeopathic like energy the dr horowitz proves is

[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:13.040]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:16.560]  we are live ladies and gentlemen simulcasting the syndicated radio
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:24.080]  transmission at prisonplanet.tv and living color
[1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:28.240]  it is the second day of november 2009 on this monday edition
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:32.080]  coming up in the final hour today we're now into hour number two
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:36.080]  coming up in the fourth hour we've gone over some of the subsections but i
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:39.520]  thought i'd go over the entire 200 plus page
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:43.440]  framework convention on climate change which openly announces world
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:46.400]  government no more national sovereignty the united
[1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:49.840]  states cannot get out of it an unelected private rockefeller
[1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:54.720]  foundation board will run every sovereign nation on earth their
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:09:00.240]  their stated goal is to end the industrial society
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:06.960]  this is neo feudalism that is coming up today next hour i'm going to get into
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:09.840]  what's happening with the economy is the dollar plunges
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:14.720]  oil and copper and gold explode and rally but bill
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:18.800]  sardy is our guest and i'm really honored to have him on with us i want to
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:22.320]  get into the fact that months ago we had listeners calling in saying
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:26.480]  elementary students their children were being forcibly inoculated
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:30.560]  and they would go to the school and say why did you do this they would lie and
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:33.440]  say they didn't and they'd say you're the only one saying this and other
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:38.080]  parents would show up saying my child said you injected him i told you not to
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:43.040]  now it's broken all over the united states texas kentucky
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:46.800]  california new york massachusetts that they're forcibly
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:50.000]  injecting and the talking point this is all staged
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  is oops we screwed up and we're only finding out about the kids that didn't
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.320]  go into the hospital here is new york daily news
[1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:01.520]  public school nurses give swine flu vaccine to kids without parents okay
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:05.280]  since children to hospital we're only finding out when they have convulsions
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:07.840]  or collapse you heard a nurse earlier from
[1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:11.840]  satan saying half or more of the nurses got sick when they were told they'd be
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:18.640]  fired if they didn't take it new york nurses rebelled and stopped that
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:22.800]  now i want to tell you about bill sardy
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:26.000]  he writes for lou rockwell dot com a lot of other big publications
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.280]  he's a medical researcher author in the areas of health and nutrition
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:32.960]  he's authored numerous books including the new truth about vitamins and minerals
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:36.560]  the red wine pill vitamin c report more
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:43.040]  and he is a journalist of medical subjects he is a medical journalist and
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:46.720]  we're honored to have him with us and throughout this hour
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:50.720]  we're going to be taking your phone calls only on flu whistleblowers
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:53.760]  people who've been forced to take it people whose children were forced to
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:58.880]  take it people who have neighbors children who were forced to take it
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.040]  what freaks me out is everything we hear here months before
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:06.640]  then becomes mainstream news later and what does it say
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:10.480]  about the lawlessness of government and the whole medical tyranny
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:14.240]  and the federalized health departments that they're forcibly injecting people
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:17.280]  all over the country bill i want to ask you about that first and get into all
[1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:20.400]  these detailed articles you've been writing
[1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:24.000]  about this entire behemoth fraud and hoax
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.600]  that's made the in the last two weeks the vaccine makers an additional seven
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:31.360]  billion good to have you here with us thank you alex have you had your flu
[1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:36.400]  shot yet alex no i haven't built if you haven't you can join most
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:39.680]  the members of congress some pediatricians in south
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:44.080]  florida say it's unsafe some colorado hospitals that say
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:47.280]  back away don't send that flu miss thing here
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:51.280]  that you the nasally instilled vaccine you'll start a pandemic right here in
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:54.880]  our own hospital these are admissions from health care workers
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:11:58.720]  themselves you can see the pushback nurses and
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:03.840]  doctors just pushing this away so if this is still on your mind
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:08.000]  university at Purdue researchers saying over the weekend
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.200]  it's worthless to vaccinate now your children especially of no benefit
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:17.120]  because it takes three to four weeks to develop enough antibodies
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:20.960]  for proper immunity by then the flu season is
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:25.200]  over this thing is peaking early and you will get no benefit if
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:30.480]  everybody mass vaccinate right now with the available doses they claim
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:34.480]  that's the 22.4 million everybody today
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:38.240]  you'll only reduce the infections by six percent
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:42.160]  meaningless reduction in mortality and so on so
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:45.440]  it's just so you know they know how to plot these
[1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:50.400]  and predict and they know what's going on it's useless and the news media
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:54.240]  by the way ignoring that study showing too late now
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:58.240]  you're just too late to make any benefit and by the way
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:02.240]  the cdc still recommending everybody get a seasonal flu shot
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:06.240]  when there's no seasonal flu in circulation all we have
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:11.120]  is the pandemic h1n1 you can go to the cdc website
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:18.160]  and see it yourself 99% in circulation is the flu the pandemic strain
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:21.680]  it's useless to get the seasonal flu shot so all you get
[1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:25.600]  is a little bit of the disease itself and did i say that
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:30.480]  yes i did the flu shot is a little bit of the disease what do you think they're
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:35.440]  giving you how do you provoke antibodies now especially the flu myth
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:39.200]  that's the that's the nasally and still liquid one so the kids
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:42.320]  avoid the needles but you notice that one became available
[1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:45.920]  first you want to start a pandemic give that one first
[1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:50.640]  because about two percent of the people you come in contact with if you had that
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:54.480]  nasally and still one you're going to give it to those people
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:57.600]  now you know they're doing this at schools because
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:01.120]  well wait a minute the teachers are going to get it and and then the pregnant
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:05.040]  teachers are going to get it and then the babies are going to get it
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:08.960]  and you don't see hospitals saying if you have gotten the flu myth
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:12.800]  in the last few days do not enter here you don't see that so
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:16.560]  you know this is the kind of danger this is how to start
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:23.920]  the flu myth is the live virus itself so just so you understand yes you may not
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:27.280]  like needles but that's what it is and that's how they're
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:31.120]  started i even wonder if this delay is to try to get the
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:35.920]  pandemic going because it's it's it's fizzling out and
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:40.240]  and they really need this thing to get going and they need more deaths as you
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:43.840]  know they they claim 36 000 deaths a year
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:47.360]  and you everybody can see it now what does it say there
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:50.880]  a thousand deaths in eight months that's way under
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:56.000]  36 000 in a year so everybody take a look at their own figures
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.480]  we have a very mild flu epidemic on our hand that doesn't mean that people
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:04.560]  don't get pretty sick they can but i don't know i want to
[1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:08.720]  i want to go over with you all the different facets in the research and
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:12.400]  everything you're saying you have links to the cdc in your articles
[1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:16.080]  this is all admitted fact but i want to pull back first and look at the big
[1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:19.360]  picture here do you agree with me that this is
[1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:22.720]  nothing but a federalization of local police
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:27.760]  and local medical facilities and the federal government itself taking
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:31.680]  orders from the united nations the un bragging this is great for global
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:35.440]  governance we declared the level six global pandemic
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:39.840]  on a regional basis not off of actual illnesses or deaths
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:42.800]  and what do you think the bigger picture here is now
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:47.360]  with schools all over the country forcibly injecting children even against
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:50.480]  parents wishes and then spinning it with the same
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:54.480]  talking point that it was just a mistake uh
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:58.160]  this is the perfect martial law cover not this year
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:01.840]  but in the you're gonna you're gonna get hospital administrators and others call
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:05.360]  up say well you know we're not it we don't do any of that
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:10.560]  well you know who's accepting the nine billion dollars here i mean
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:14.720]  they've got payoffs to all of these places if they will push
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:18.480]  the flu shots and they're going to miss out on the money now you know everybody
[1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:21.520]  search for money including hospitals and clinics and so
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:25.200]  this is the story they aren't distributing this year
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:28.720]  this flu shot in pharmacies and places like that
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:31.600]  they're going right to the schools they're going right to the workplace
[1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:35.200]  where they can coerce you as a healthcare worker
[1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:39.600]  as somebody who works in a grocery store wherever to get that flu shot
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:42.480]  and their economic incentives to do this so
[1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:46.560]  where someone might say this this is not
[1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:51.920]  not uh you know federally controlled well try again it's all funded by the
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:55.520]  federal government they're giving it away and people are still rejecting it
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:00.320]  past years consumers had to pay now now they're saying you get the flu shot for
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:05.200]  free now bill bill that's my that's my question to
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:10.080]  you analyzing this i want your perspective
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:13.760]  is this just not the perfect federalization vehicle
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:18.400]  is this not just a beta test for the future a way to clamp down on society
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:23.840]  during a financial meltdown or for other reasons even better than terrorism
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:27.600]  uh a biological pathogen is the perfect way
[1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:31.200]  to be able to fully federalize things and take total control
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:34.800]  over society and all the evidence that i'm seeing shows
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:38.640]  that this is a beta test for total federalization
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:42.400]  of the world because we see it now on a world scale
[1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:46.400]  with this flu and of course the the flu
[1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:51.360]  because it mutates because it's seasonal and so on now we have perpetual
[1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:55.840]  treatment to handle a perpetual flu pandemic they invent this thing late
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:17:58.800]  in the season by the way if all of you bought into the idea
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:03.040]  this thing came from a pig you can see the graphics provided by the center for
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:08.080]  disease control showing it came from swine they could not find any swine
[1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:13.360]  herds with this version of the flu until recently what does that tell you
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:19.280]  we gave it to the pigs come on wake up it's an engineered virus we can't find
[1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:24.320]  any other origin of this now they claim patient number one was a little boy
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:29.200]  in a village in mexico but a lot of people got sick but he was the only boy
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:32.800]  with that particular strain if that's what they claim
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:37.200]  the kids getting sick from other things in that village then they claim there
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:40.800]  were two children in here in los angeles that
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:44.240]  had it first but again we can't track this down
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:48.560]  as to how it re assorted you'd have to send this pig back and forth on an
[1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:52.320]  airplane to asia so it wouldn't make any sense well they said that
[1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:55.360]  therefore because it takes a lot of mutations a lot of time
[1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:59.440]  it had to be circulating in the population and we just missed it
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:03.920]  all of those over a thousand flu monitoring centers the world health
[1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:07.280]  organization has around the globe missed this thing
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:11.120]  come on we this isn't true and bill happen
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:16.640]  expanding on that is engineered from what i can see till we rule that out
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:19.760]  that's what it is well bill you're not the only one saying
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:25.760]  this i've seen bbc headlines that top scientists say it was made in a lab
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:29.360]  alex you know and i know we're just trying to educate the public
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:35.200]  when societies when when poly politicians get trouble with an economy
[1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:41.440]  they develop distractions usually it's a war in this case it's a war on the flu
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:45.680]  and because of that they can gain control of the economy
[1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:49.440]  what is the first thing you would do and your family would do if they heard
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:52.800]  quarantine was coming you'd go you'd run to the store for the
[1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:55.520]  food the water and the bank to get the money
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:20:00.640]  now they know that and they close down the bank stay there stay there

[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:40.320]  divert us we know mexico was on the edge of rebellion
[1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:43.440]  then they hype up a few deaths down there and lock everything down
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:47.920]  it's the perfect thing to make everybody the potential enemy
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:51.520]  and only the government are the good guys so but it sounds from what you're
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:54.720]  saying what the evidence shows that this is blowing up in their face that

[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.080]  in the falcon island so be aware of this

[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:32.320]  that society is in trouble losing control of their population
[1:25:32.320 --> 1:25:37.840]  are going to create distraction reasons false reasons to close the bank
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:41.360]  and to create a crisis to take advantage of it didn't the
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:45.040]  the uh... the president main man there uh... say he was gonna
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:49.840]  don't let a good crisis pass by so you know we need to be aware of manipulation
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:53.040]  by government and for all of you who are good americans
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:56.880]  who are loyal to the flag and everything remember our
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:00.640]  our country started with skepticism about government
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:03.840]  and so you know we need a healthy skepticism
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:07.120]  sure we're loyal sure we're good americans and we believe
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:11.360]  in that constitution that limited federal government and intrusion
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:15.520]  into our homes into our finances and so many things that are now
[1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:20.800]  of course just passed aside under the idea of a phony crisis so
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:25.440]  i want you to all see that and understand what we're trying to teach you
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:28.800]  you know in the past people have said well you know there's a crisis there's a
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:34.160]  crisis so buy gold or whatever it's this is for real this time you can
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:38.480]  see it from the government's own uh... you know
[1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:42.960]  massaging of the news media which is their front man for this whole thing
[1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:47.920]  and by the way they're losing grip we see a repudiation of government and what
[1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:50.400]  did they come out and say they're going to shut down the alex
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:52.880]  joneshow that's basically what they said
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:57.200]  because the general accounting office comes up with some phony scheme
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:00.240]  that all americans are going to be so sick they're going to run home and they're
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:03.600]  going to jump on the internet because they're not at work and then they're
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:07.680]  going to massively take up all this bandwidth and shut down the internet
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:11.040]  so that they they're going to government is going to have to shut down the
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:14.400]  internet in part to keep that from occurring they
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:17.680]  wouldn't be shutting down the alex joneshow would they
[1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:21.200]  they know that these alternative news sources
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:24.960]  are are getting people to back away from the blue shots
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:27.840]  and they're trying to find any way possible
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:33.280]  to shut off this information you can see from abc to nbc
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:37.440]  to cbs to whatever news source cnn fox news
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:41.680]  they're all following the party line the centers for disease control issues the
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:45.520]  press releases and this is what the public hears
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:49.840]  there is no good reason to have the seasonal flu shot did you hear that
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:54.320]  from any of the news sources that you rely upon you should have heard it
[1:27:54.320 --> 1:27:58.480]  and your young children now at risk for side effects only
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:02.000]  first do no harm as the rule in modern medicine
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:05.360]  so thank you alex jones for having me on so i can say this
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:10.720]  if i am right look at my articles you'll see
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:14.640]  that the u.s government hid the largest
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:19.120]  flu epidemic it was a mortal flu epidemic in 1993
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:23.680]  it set back the life expectancy of americans for the first time
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:27.920]  since 1918 the year of the spanish flu it had a dramatic
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:32.960]  decline in our life expectancy which went unexplained no other news reporter
[1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:38.000]  catches on to this i go digging into it look at morbidity mortality weekly
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:41.680]  reports the government's own data showing there was a late
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:47.120]  flu season in 1993 it struck older adults in nursing homes
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:51.760]  killed thousands of them and what was it it was the first year
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:54.800]  that medicare paid for flu shots in nursing homes
[1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:58.400]  that's what triggered it it was a it was a mortal
[1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:02.640]  deadly flu vaccine because it would have set back the flu vaccination
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:06.800]  program they hid the whole thing and not one reporter in the united
[1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:10.640]  states it reports on this you can go to the
[1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:14.880]  centers for disease control look up mortality rates the life expectancy in
[1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:18.880]  the united states you'll see it went down dramatically in 1993
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:23.200]  it was the flu shot that caused it and by the way
[1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:28.160]  tracking all the way back to 1918 now is dr caron m starko
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:33.440]  allowing us to see what really caused all those deaths in 1918 it was treatment
[1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:37.040]  related as she's showing that bear the big drug
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:40.560]  company was marketing aspirin that year the a m a
[1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:45.600]  promoted aspirin for treatment of the flu the people were overdosing on aspirin

[1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:46.880]  that's how diabolical these corporate controllers are
[1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:50.000]  bill sardy premier investigative journals with
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:53.600]  with lu rockwell.com or go back to him in just a moment
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:59.600]  i wanted to let you know that fall the republic my new film is out
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:03.360]  and this is the documentary that is the most up-to-date
[1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:05.760]  that puts all the big pieces of the puzzle together
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:08.880]  that shows you from their own statements their own documents
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:13.360]  how the financial elite are buying up the world through fraud
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:16.480]  how they're bankrupting the planet to openly bring in world government and
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:19.680]  the carbon tax what the carbon tax is going to mean to you
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:23.920]  what the global treaties are going to mean the global government
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:28.560]  this film my other films are great but this is a whole new level
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:32.800]  this is a exponential growth curve in quality and material
[1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:37.120]  fall of the republic volume one it's got barack obama's mug on the front
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:42.960]  because he's the closer with the slick harvard read off the teleprompter
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:48.480]  a pitch and he's there to pacify the public and to take the whole anti
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:51.520]  george bush revolution that was that was legitimate
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:54.960]  and energize the globalist operation by people
[1:34:54.960 --> 1:34:58.480]  thinking they're fighting the establishment when they support obama
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:04.800]  when he is the establishment follow the republic available at info wars.com
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:08.080]  on the online video bookstore check out some of the discounts there we have
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:11.200]  follow the republic and other films for half price
[1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:15.920]  we also have all the t-shirts the point is we've gotten the word out about the
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:18.400]  flu and the establishment starting to panic and
[1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:22.480]  they're losing they're still hurting a lot of people though
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:27.840]  but we're ahead in this game you can do the same thing with fall the
[1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:32.720]  republic on dvd ladies and gentlemen order it make copies have viewing parties
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:35.920]  give it to your local police chief your sheriff your pastor
[1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:41.120]  now is the time you can also watch it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:49.200]  or call toll free 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 you can also
[1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:54.080]  write to me it's 1995 p.o. box 19549 austin texas 787
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:59.440]  60 now going back to bill bill i want to get to some whistleblowers
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:02.480]  maybe i'll twist your arms even more into the next hour because at times running
[1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:05.360]  out and i know you have so much knowledge and so many important reports
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:09.520]  you've broken but briefly because then i have
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:12.640]  a question tell us about some of your best-selling books and
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:16.240]  materials where people can learn about this for themselves
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:20.160]  we do have a lot of articles at lou rockwell dot com there's a whole series
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:23.360]  there and we're trying to do this day by day because
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:28.160]  of the zigzag information from the federal government and you see
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:32.160]  one day it's going to be oh it's going to take two shots to develop the immunity
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:37.040]  this year oh it only takes one you see how did we get that change they
[1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:40.960]  admitted that all prior years we didn't develop enough
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:44.960]  immunity because we needed two shots one to prime our immune system one
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:48.560]  want to get it going so you know they're changing
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:53.120]  the the ideas here that they're giving us from one minute to the other what
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:56.400]  oh is a mock vaccine that we're getting this year that means they
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:36:59.920]  they they approve the way that they make it
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:03.760]  and then they were just going to insert the vaccine you get it two weeks later
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:07.200]  well wait a minute now now now they're not so fast in their production this was
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:11.920]  supposed to be real-time production almost well you know what i think it is
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:16.000]  the mock vaccine i think it is real time but i think they're reluctant to
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.440]  produce a vaccine that nobody wants so they don't want to go in the hole on
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:23.760]  this thing any further by the way where is the declaration from the centers for
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:26.320]  disease control they're canceling the purchase orders
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:30.000]  because of lack of public demand they don't want to eat it you see
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:34.560]  nine billion dollars promised to the drug companies over this thing
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:38.560]  we have to push back if you can understand where we're going here
[1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:44.320]  is that every possible infectious disease you would have to have a vaccine for
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:48.640]  you're going to have 60 70 80 vaccine this is insane they're giving
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:52.240]  little kids right on the first day of life
[1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:57.120]  in the hospital hepatitis shot they can't even develop antibodies at that age
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:01.680]  so you you're getting nothing but disease and it's going into children
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:04.880]  we know the autism rate one and ninety one children
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:08.880]  it's unbelievable from one and twenty five thousand from one and twenty five
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:12.960]  thousand bill let me let me throw out a few bullet points at you
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:17.760]  you just dropped that giant bombshell you've written detailed articles
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:22.320]  about how the big flu pandemics that we've had 93 one of the biggest
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:26.320]  followed the mass inoculations of the elderly
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:31.280]  we know vaccines were associated in 76 at the military basis with the troops
[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:35.040]  breaking out with it we have ap and Reuters and cbs
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:38.720]  admitting in asia and latin america and the middle east and
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:42.880]  in africa the un is giving people live polio
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.720]  vaccines that are maiming them and killing them and then they just admit it
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:50.800]  nobody gets in trouble now they're giving people a nasal
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:55.200]  flu vaccine that they admit is spreading it how obvious is that
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:00.160]  to prime the pump now they're forcibly injecting school
[1:39:00.160 --> 1:39:04.720]  children everywhere the evidence is they are doing this on purpose
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:09.200]  i mean this is more bold than i even thought who the hell are these people
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:12.800]  what's the end game comment on those points bill with your expert
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.560]  if you want to listen all the skeptics now if you want to listen to this
[1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:20.400]  you know vaccines one of the best things that's ever happened to us
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:25.760]  remember now this is 1798 technology cowpox technology edward
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:30.160]  Jenner was the doctor we cannot continue to give
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:35.440]  ourselves 60 70 80 different vaccines in our lifetime for every
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:38.880]  possible infectious disease and where they're leading us to
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:42.240]  the end game let me tell you where that ends up
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:45.440]  you're going to have vaccine resistance you're going to have
[1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:51.600]  antiviral like tamaflu and relenza resistance you're going to then have
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:53.840]  antibiotic resistance we already have that
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:39:56.960]  as they try to treat these super infections in your lung
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:00.480]  and they're leading us to a dead end street where no treatments work
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:05.280]  so please push back from this agenda and by the way
[1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:10.400]  researchers at both the male clinic and in japan saying if we went ahead
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:15.120]  and in inoculated 70 to 80 percent of our population we would put so much
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:20.960]  genetic pressure on these flu viruses that we might induce the very
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:25.760]  mutated virus that would then no one would have a mutated to
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:29.600]  and we would have a massive massive destruction
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:33.520]  of human life across the globe so believe me
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:37.840]  if they're not listening to the scientists as they say
[1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:42.560]  come back do not go there they're putting up red flags the scientists
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:45.760]  themselves and you see a totally different story
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:48.880]  from centers this product disease control please
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:51.840]  and you know your children are going to get no benefit
[1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:56.160]  and possible now i've tried to point this out i have a little e-book we offered
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:59.440]  it free at lou rockwell dot com the hidden epidemic
[1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:03.760]  young children do not have a blood brain barrier till the age of two
[1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:07.280]  there is no barrier to keep germs from getting out they rely
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:11.280]  on immune factors from their mother's milk and other ways of doing this by the
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:14.320]  way vitamin c vitamin d and fish oil should be
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:18.640]  in your children's regimen from day one if you're giving formula you put the
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:22.480]  vitamin cd and fish oil in there and that'll
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:25.920]  mimic the immune system that mother let me stop you that's a whole
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:29.760]  another issue they know that formula in the major studies
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:33.680]  results in smaller brains and and and weak immune systems
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:37.920]  do they put fish oil do they put vitamin c in there when the baby needs those
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:42.800]  fats and and needs that vitamin c hell no but they don't have the others
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:47.280]  alex what we're telling everybody and alerting everybody to
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:52.480]  is the massive death in 1918 thanks to karen m starco
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:58.080]  md allowing us to see it was the overuse of aspirin and what does aspirin do we
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:01.680]  went digging further it depletes the body of vitamin c
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:05.200]  what happens when you're depleted of vitamin c you'll have
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:08.480]  hemorrhaging and filling of your lungs you have
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:14.480]  edema they call it you know pulmonary edema that's what you died of in 1918
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:18.480]  that the flu virus dramatically depletes the vitamin c levels
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:22.320]  in the lungs in particular a doctor can do a blood test
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:26.640]  see if your blood level is normal he's only going to test your blood plasma
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:31.280]  it's the blood the lymphocytes the white blood cells that are depleted of
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:36.480]  well bill vitamin c bill i'm no doctor to die you're going to die
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:41.200]  all of the high risk groups for dying for mortality from the flu are vitamin c
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:46.240]  deficient the pregnant the smokers the diabetics the asthmatics all of them
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:50.080]  every group now we're trying to get a letter published
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:53.760]  in one of the major journals starting discussion about maybe
[1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:57.760]  the lack of vitamin c you see once they get you in the hospital
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:02.320]  they're starting to give you the steroids to reduce inflammation that
[1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:06.000]  depletes you of vitamin c they can give you the tetracycline
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:09.360]  family antibiotics that depletes you of vitamin c they then give you the
[1:43:09.360 --> 1:43:12.000]  diuretics because your body is filling up with fluid
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:15.760]  again it depletes you of vitamin c and they're leading you this is why i've
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:18.320]  said for a long time there's no reason why
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:21.280]  anyone should die of the flu in an intensive care unit
[1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:25.040]  they're intentionally or unwittingly you know
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:30.000]  leading you to scurvy when you die of scurvy this is what you die of
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.560]  the thing that tipped it off is is that there's cerebral edema in the brain
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:39.840]  that is a normal part of the flu this in 1918
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:44.080]  was a vitamin c deficiency induced by the treatment and the overuse of aspirin
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:48.400]  other way on the labels of every aspirin bottle is the proof of what i say it
[1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:52.400]  says not take this if you have the flu so it'll
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:56.640]  lead to mortality in children so it's the vitamin c
[1:43:56.640 --> 1:44:00.560]  deficiency is the last link i'm making by doing a little
[1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:04.640]  medical investigation on my own please everyone should be on vitamin c
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:07.600]  you'll say well it doesn't prevent colds in the flu no but it prevents
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:13.360]  mortality from those so please your young children should be on vitamin c
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:17.760]  but bill get this here here's the big issue
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:23.920]  i've read the histories of the surgeons 300 years ago in british ships
[1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:26.560]  and that's why the british were called limies
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:30.000]  and that was what finally let the british empire take over the seas
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.880]  was they have the secret for oh as you know i'm sure
[1:44:32.880 --> 1:44:36.720]  a hundred years that these little limes that they could keep for
[1:44:36.720 --> 1:44:41.280]  six months or more on the ship and that wouldn't go bad
[1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:44.400]  when their soldiers met other navies who'd been out for a year
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:48.000]  all their teeth were falling out they were dying
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:52.560]  old cuts were opening back up the the british scientist
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:58.080]  knew about citrus they didn't understand it was vitamin c and
[1:44:58.080 --> 1:45:01.840]  that's why the british were called limies because everywhere the british army
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:05.520]  and navy went they had limes now by world war one
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:09.840]  they were eating horrible rations no fruit they've had no vitamin c they're
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:14.640]  told take aspirin that further depletes it and now a weak virus can kill
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:17.680]  people in mass but people back home out on the farm
[1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:21.280]  eating citrus it goes back as you know to the black plague people out in the
[1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:25.360]  countryside eating garlic eating citrus they weren't dying people in the
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:30.400]  cities cramped were medical science knows this
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:35.360]  so i'm asking you why don't they tell people sunshine vitamin a vitamin d
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:39.600]  vitamin c if linus pauling won the nobel prize for this
[1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:44.640]  why aren't they telling people the secret
[1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:49.520]  you know we had a little study that we extrapolated data from and it showed
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:53.280]  that if we just took a fortified our foods or got a massive
[1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:58.000]  the dietary supplement regimen going in the united states so we got
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:01.760]  sufficient levels of vitamin d now that's the sunshine vitamin
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:04.720]  it can even be deficient if you're in south florida
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:08.480]  a lot of people cover up from the sun they're phobic about skin cancer so
[1:46:08.480 --> 1:46:12.240]  it doesn't matter what part of the year and that means our immune system is
[1:46:12.240 --> 1:46:15.440]  down by the way if the president of the united states should
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:21.120]  get a flu shot he's in real high risk group because he's a dark skin man
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:24.960]  with a very low vitamin d level characteristic in dark skin individuals
[1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:28.000]  and then he's a smoker depleting vitamin c so
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:32.080]  he's at great risk and we're trying to tell if you're in an at risk group you
[1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:35.200]  do not get the vaccine they're trying to tell you to get it if you're in a high
[1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:39.520]  risk group no you do not get it and what they did is a study
[1:46:39.520 --> 1:46:42.880]  where they took the animals and the animals little
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:46.480]  little rodents mice were were pregnant then they
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:49.200]  gave them inoculated and with the flu and it showed
[1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:53.680]  that it caused in the little fetuses in in the little mice
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:58.560]  that it caused a brain disturbance with a genetic pattern that was similar to
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:02.880]  autism so therefore the conclusion was protect against the flu no no
[1:47:02.880 --> 1:47:07.680]  protect against the flu vaccine it is they're they're telling us how
[1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:12.160]  autism gets started it's the vaccine bill i gotta stop you again
[1:47:12.160 --> 1:47:16.720]  that's what's so insane is up until a year ago they said don't give pregnant
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:20.960]  women flu shots because they knew now they invert the studies
[1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:24.400]  and do it what has changed why are they getting
[1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:28.320]  more diabolical as people wake up to the fact of the study
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:32.800]  yes alex they're starting a study among pregnant women if you can imagine
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:36.480]  this now these will be healthy pregnant women and you know
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:39.920]  they'll do a study it'll be over within about seven months too late
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:44.160]  sorry they haven't done any studies to prove safety of this vaccine you may
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:48.080]  hear otherwise from your own doctor there are no studies to prove safety in
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:51.440]  the at-risk groups the smokers the asthmatics the
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:54.720]  diabetics so these are the people we need to protect the rest of you can
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:58.080]  have the flu shot you'll get sick maybe but
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:02.240]  you won't die what we're concerned about is the at-risk groups and by the way as
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:06.080]  i say all of them deficient vitamin but that's what i'm saying
[1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:10.480]  why are they this time pushing it i have the inserts
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:15.520]  i can go read fda.gov it it it says it could hurt you if you're pregnant it
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:18.080]  says if you're diabetic it says if you have asthma
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:21.920]  but that's who they're pushing it on i mean are they trying to get caught
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:26.320]  what is the point it is really diabolical it is
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:30.240]  certainly misdirection it is certainly irresponsible
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:34.560]  uh you cannot claim it's ignorant they have smart scientists there
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:38.080]  we have published literature that i cite i do not
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.680]  i do not ring the bell of fear over you know unless i have the science to
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:46.560]  back it up you'll see all the references of my article
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:50.320]  the point is we're using the government's own data to show you they're not
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:53.200]  even consistent with their own recommendation
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:58.160]  that there is no way any flu vaccine is safe they have make a new one every
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:01.680]  year we have no idea and so they you know they
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:04.320]  claimed they were going to make a mock vaccine
[1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:08.000]  they then said well you know we didn't get it fast enough
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:13.920]  uh there are certainly problems here when a government tells you hurry up
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:17.920]  hurry up get it and then it isn't there listen folks if these
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:20.480]  people had to protect us from world war three
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:23.920]  we should have fired them a long time ago they can't even handle a flu epidemic
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:29.680]  let me ask you this why are the schools injecting children
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:33.760]  even when the parents say no and i'm seeing the same talking point
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:39.680]  bill where they say oops accident yeah there got this thing going in the
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:42.880]  schools and of course you've got a third of
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:45.760]  the public that's just the rest of you tune out
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:49.760]  the third of you aren't convinced tune in because we're just trying to get to
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:54.320]  you folks we are not ringing uh you know crying wolf here we're not we're
[1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:58.320]  using government data you want to check all the references please do
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:02.720]  i know so many of you will buy in and say well but my doctor said
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:05.760]  listen we're trying to rattle your cage a little bit about
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:09.280]  what you accept is the truth trying to get you to see
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:14.560]  the references from the government itself that's the important part here
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:20.640]  we're being misled and why there are a lot of questions as to why
[1:50:20.640 --> 1:50:25.280]  this government that we have you know the obvious escapes us alex that
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:29.040]  we'll go run off we're a broke government we'll go run off and
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:32.880]  capture the oil and the money from another country like iraq oh
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:36.160]  hey there's another one next door let's go over there they got a lot of oil and
[1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:40.080]  money too you know people don't see the obvious
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:45.680]  so you know we don't catch on what's going on health care reform is about
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:49.760]  what it's about we already have 85 percent of
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:54.000]  seizing control of another industry they can tax
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.280]  85 percent of people already covered by insurance it's about the illegal
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:00.320]  immigrants who don't have it stay there bill bill sorry
[1:51:00.320 --> 1:51:03.680]  amazing and folks jones did you know that the global elite are now
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:06.960]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:10.560]  Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become
[1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:13.920]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:17.040]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:19.600]  happen again so our friends at solutions from
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:23.280]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:26.800]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:30.400]  an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:34.000]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:38.160]  way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:43.520]  so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com

[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:25.600]  incredible reporting at lourockwell.com we link to it up at info wars.com
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:30.800]  and prisonplanet.com and I just burn with a desire to warn people
[1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:35.520]  knowing these flu shots hurt people knowing they're not telling folks that
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:39.680]  vitamins are what they need it's just so amazing and I know
[1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:45.280]  Bill burns with that same desire to warn people but I think in the final
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:48.480]  equation this has blown up in their face has it
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:53.440]  not Bill I mean this has been a big defeat for him
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:59.440]  for all of you who wonder what I do I am 64 years old I have a five-year-old boy
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:04.240]  here at home and he got bronchial pneumonia the exact thing you get with a
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:09.200]  cough he had this thing what did I do vitamin D it
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:13.680]  quells the fever vitamin C quells calms it down
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:17.200]  a little bit of elderberry extract you keep giving at the child
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:20.880]  can be fine and function well you don't want to send him to school
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:24.800]  and it'll be shortened the duration of this whole thing about three days
[1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:29.680]  now listen you just need to rely on it and use it and become confident of it
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:33.280]  and you'll think well wait a minute you know this could be mortal may we better
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:38.240]  run to the doctor and all they have is the vaccine which isn't available
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:42.160]  so they could give you a tamiflu and relenza
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:46.640]  which works in an artificial way to keep the virus from escaping
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:49.840]  from inside the cells viruses need your host cell to work
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:53.200]  it's inside your cells inside the genetic machinery
[1:55:53.200 --> 1:55:58.320]  and make the copies of itself the the tamiflu keeps the copies from escaping
[1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:02.400]  but your cells are polluted with these little virions these viral particles
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:05.040]  and now you're going to have side effects that's why we've had kids
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:10.160]  to die and so on in japan and elsewhere do not give your kids the tamiflu
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:15.600]  and you know use these natural things to get there and believe me they're very
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:19.840]  powerful you're not hearing about them from your doctor you're going to have
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:24.240]  to find alternative sources vitamin d council and elsewhere
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:27.680]  will help you with this unbiased bill that's another issue
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:31.360]  the news is reporting they're giving people the seasonal shot
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:36.720]  when they have the flu as if that is the treatment
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:40.960]  it it is not a treatment and you know the flu
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:45.600]  vaccine it is something that you try to prime a population with
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:48.800]  and then they won't get the infection what happens is
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:52.560]  it's about how effective in your mind you're listening today how effective is
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:57.360]  the flu shot about 30 to 50 effective and certainly
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:00.320]  isn't effective in any young children under the age of two
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:04.640]  very ineffective maybe 20 maybe two out of ten
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:08.720]  if you're an older adult because you've got a used up immune system when you're
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:11.680]  old you haven't got a developed immune system when you're very young
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:16.080]  it won't work that's why they have to prime this thing with two shots
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:20.000]  it's maybe 30 to 50 effective at best if it
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:25.520]  the strain of the flu is matching the the flu vaccine in that year now
[1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:28.960]  they've gone a whole years even two consecutive years
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:33.840]  where it's a trivalent vaccine there's three strains of the flu two type a and
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:37.360]  one of the type b and then they guess what's going to come next year
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:41.920]  they've gone whole seasons where they cried wolf and told you to take the shot
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:45.280]  when there was no way it could benefit you because what was in the shot didn't
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:48.560]  match the strain in circulation are we to
[1:57:48.560 --> 1:57:53.120]  believe them every year like this this is you know we're just using
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:56.480]  their own information it's become a business
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:01.040]  it's become a bigger business this year with nine billion dollars of booty from
[1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:04.880]  the federal government for all of them i mean you saw china start to go in
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:08.640]  production all of these countries as this became a big
[1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:14.160]  world market and the public better get sick on time guess what we did
[1:58:14.160 --> 1:58:17.840]  we're going to come back in 70 seconds with the third hour
[1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:21.840]  and we're going to go to roger matt tim robert john and others
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:24.880]  callers say they're whistleblowers people tried to inoculate them or they
[1:58:24.880 --> 1:58:28.560]  forcibly injected their kids we'll be talking to these callers on the other

[1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:53.760]  hey folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about oxy silver the world's
[1:58:53.760 --> 1:58:58.240]  most advanced silver hydrosol that dr horowitz says can make risky vaccines
[1:58:58.240 --> 1:59:00.160]  and antibiotics avoidable you've heard dr lennard
[1:59:00.160 --> 1:59:04.640]  horowitz and others urds vaccination avoidance instead use vitamin cd and
[1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:08.880]  oxy silver along with zeolife for broad spectrum detoxification using
[1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:13.280]  nasa science oxy silver is nano silver covalently bonded to water
[1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:17.520]  oxy silver safely electrocutes pathogens oxygenates for faster healing
[1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:21.280]  then delivers a 528 hertz frequency homeopathic like
[1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:24.880]  energy the dr horowitz proves his fundamental to life in recovering

[2:00:05.040 --> 2:00:11.440]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers

[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:24.640]  austin texas alex jones bell sardi is our guest for another 20
[2:00:24.640 --> 2:00:27.200]  minutes we're taking your phone calls right now
[2:00:27.200 --> 2:00:30.800]  roger in missouri you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:37.120]  yeah hi alex uh i think uh they've ratcheted up this uh swine flu shots in
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:41.360]  the last uh two three weeks it's it's they're really pushing it but i'm
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:46.720]  glad you have the investigator on there because in 1972 when i was in the
[2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:50.720]  marine corps um we was either forced we was
[2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:55.040]  forcibly tricked i guess you'd say into getting a flu shot it was on
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:59.440]  wednesday before thanksgiving and it was a payday and back then you got paid with
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:03.440]  checks still and we had to go get the shot before
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:08.000]  we uh could get our paycheck and after we got the shot we was told we got a flu
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:11.520]  shot now everybody that i know not everybody in the
[2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:15.840]  marine corps got this but everybody that i know that got the flu shot in
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:19.600]  72 the same time i did have the same things wrong with them
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:26.400]  some is to our higher degree uh bad knees arthritis uh heart problems
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:32.400]  um you know gets sick real easy catch catch anything that
[2:01:32.400 --> 2:01:37.520]  it comes around but um let me bring this up to to bill and then we'll get a
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:42.160]  comment back from you roger dr blalock 10 pinning all these others they they
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:47.120]  show all these different studies where in studies with rodents
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:52.240]  that the vaccines cause an autoimmune response a swelling on all the joints
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:56.320]  in the organs in the brain that it actually burns out your immune system
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:00.160]  by jacking it up and also is clearly linked
[2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:04.960]  conclusively to arthritis have you seen that information
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:08.800]  it's the cytokine storm we you know we're worried about it
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:13.600]  again because that's what the you have a cytokine storm the cytokines are
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:17.920]  inflammatory factors and then the body makes a response
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:21.520]  and in the lungs if this occurs you you fill up with fluid and
[2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:25.600]  drown in your own lung fluid that's what happened in 1918
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:30.320]  but you can be left with more chronic autoimmune responses like this as the
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:35.120]  body is now switched on against yourself and of course we're very concerned
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:39.040]  by the way if you think mercury is out of this vaccine remember the fda
[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:42.480]  promised two or three years ago that we're going to take the thimerosal the
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:46.800]  mercury out let's back in there again well now you can opt and get the one
[2:02:46.800 --> 2:02:50.000]  that's mercury free oh oh wait a minute aluminum
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:53.600]  my print the mercury still in there it's just a lot less
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:57.040]  it's mercury folks i'll tell you what for all of you folks
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:00.640]  that are really just nervous and you want to get your kids vaccinated
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:03.760]  i want you to get some lead and i want you to back in
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:07.840]  inoculate your kids with lead would you do that you wouldn't do it
[2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:12.000]  mercury is far more dangerous than lead let's go back real fast to roger roger
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  other comments yes uh after that uh after i got out of the
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.840]  marine corps i was tracked so many things has come together in the last few
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:23.680]  years through the census bureau no matter where i
[2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:30.240]  moved to early i lived in st louis missouri in uh in 1979 and i was told
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:34.160]  that i was picked to uh be a census taker to get
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:39.040]  information from me every year uh in 1980 i moved to austin
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:42.480]  texas i lived out in lake travis and the same
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:46.880]  census taker come and talked to me and it was all about
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:50.320]  my health it was yeah let me stop you this is incredible
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:53.760]  in 1968 and this is one of thousands of examples
[2:03:53.760 --> 2:03:57.040]  they released a biological weapon in the new york subway
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:02.240]  and then they had doctors waiting military doctors posing as local doctors
[2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:06.000]  and then it they reported they tracked them for life
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:12.240]  that i had rick one of rick perry's uh operatives come to one of our events and
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:17.840]  he admitted that they gave people shots at fort sam houston and they all died
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:22.720]  uh bill your take on what this gentleman just said
[2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:27.120]  when we say that vaccines have a history of saving so many lives
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:32.560]  we must look back at what happened what was going on in 1918 we didn't have
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:35.760]  antibiotics yet we didn't even have vitamin c pills yet
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:39.200]  what we had is we were starting to clean up our food our water
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:42.640]  we had the pure food drug act many years later
[2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:46.400]  public hygiene was responsible for the improvements in health
[2:04:46.400 --> 2:04:51.680]  not stay there gotta break roger i want to give you a final comment when we
[2:04:51.680 --> 2:04:56.480]  come back but i mean the same census taker comes from Missouri to texas
[2:04:56.480 --> 2:05:00.240]  they were clearly tracking you to see what the shot had done
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:03.600]  have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power
[2:05:03.600 --> 2:05:07.280]  if so this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:11.120]  solar power generators are now available from solutions from science in toms
[2:05:11.120 --> 2:05:13.840]  in illinois these emergency backup systems provide
[2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:17.840]  lifesaving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a
[2:05:17.840 --> 2:05:22.400]  solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free
[2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:26.080]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home
[2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:30.880]  run some bumps shortwave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:34.320]  whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts

[2:08:50.880 --> 2:08:54.800]  foreign unelected boards in control of every facet of our lives

[2:08:58.240 --> 2:09:01.280]  finishing quickly in missouri for people who just joined us
[2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:04.960]  everybody you knew in that group of marines that were given this flu shot
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:08.480]  got arthritis and all these other health problems and then they would have
[2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:13.040]  strange census takers the same person as you moved around the country would show
[2:09:13.040 --> 2:09:17.360]  back up and wanted to know about how you were doing medically i've seen in
[2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:20.640]  other documents where they've done chemical biological
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:26.160]  radiological test on the military and they do track you that way and they do
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:28.560]  those exact same things finish up
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:32.960]  forgot to mention that uh... they was 350 marines got that shot including our
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:36.000]  colonel and we was all definitely ill
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:39.440]  or and we was off work for thanksgiving proddy
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:42.960]  you know thanksgiving proddy after saturday and sunday and monday
[2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:47.360]  when we usually had about 15 guys on sick call we had like a hundred
[2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:50.560]  what do you think of this what do you think
[2:09:50.560 --> 2:09:55.040]  oh you know with the census you know the the census coming around
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:09:59.360]  trying to spot your your homes and everything it all come together to me
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:02.320]  uh... the second time the same census tech
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:06.480]  taker uh... come to see me i slam the door in her face and like to scare my
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:11.120]  wife to death because i mean she was dressed different
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:15.200]  and had some different kind of makeup on and everything but you could tell it
[2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:19.920]  was the same lady and uh... but two weeks ago
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:24.560]  i had a uh... uh... surgery in uh... the v a hospital
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:29.760]  in st louis and i think that they have certain people on staff that really
[2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:35.360]  really push these flu shots i had one nurse really give me a hard time
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:39.760]  because i've not had one since 1972 one was enough for me
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:44.640]  but uh... i was hooked up to an ivy and they had me so upset
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:47.440]  that i wouldn't let them put anything in my ivy until they showed me the
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:52.240]  vile and i read it what they was well we need to start behaving like you're
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:56.480]  doing god bless you thank you know bill that is the
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:00.720]  the silver lining in the storm cloud is they've hurt so many people
[2:11:00.720 --> 2:11:04.960]  that the public isn't buying anything they say or do
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:10.320]  we need to see what's happening on our maps of the united states and if you
[2:11:10.320 --> 2:11:13.600]  draw some maps right from the centers for disease control
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:16.960]  where is the hooping cost in the united states where is
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:20.560]  the hepatitis where is the tuberculosis in the lung
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:23.760]  it's all on the southern border our poor immigrants
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:27.680]  bringing it unwittingly to this country unscreened
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:32.240]  the public health authorities allowing it to go on and what's their
[2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:36.640]  answer what's the cure why of course vaccines
[2:11:36.640 --> 2:11:42.080]  you see they're letting it happen as that it can build the vaccine trade
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:46.000]  we need to see through this this is if we need public
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:49.760]  prevention protection we don't need more disease for more
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:53.440]  vaccines that's their current policy by the way
[2:11:53.440 --> 2:11:58.560]  ever strike you funny that japan will not allow our meat into their country
[2:11:58.560 --> 2:12:03.200]  we have unclean food we have ecoli and the beef killed two people according to
[2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:06.720]  today's headlines we have in the chicken salmonella
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:10.800]  and campylobacter in the milk we have perituberculosis
[2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:14.640]  i mean we have contaminated food it is only because
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:18.480]  of the tremendous buy-off of american politicians by
[2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:22.720]  american business that this is allowed the centers for disease control u.s
[2:12:22.720 --> 2:12:26.800]  department of agriculture saying they know they have a problem they've got
[2:12:26.800 --> 2:12:31.680]  water runoff from the animal farms with this bacteria getting into them the
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:34.640]  vegetables and fruit and then we we blame the little
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:38.080]  strawberries and things like that that's nonsense
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:44.080]  so we've got to stop this this is insane we're just causing more disease for
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:47.360]  more vaccine this is not the way to have a
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:50.000]  public health policy all right event disease
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:53.760]  i agree with you let's talk to matt in ohio matt you're on the air
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:57.200]  hi up your guest bill can help us out here
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:01.520]  my wife and i have a 10-month-old child and we've been concerned about the
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:04.880]  just the regular shots and so we went into discuss these
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:09.120]  whether uh on the second round so he has not had his those third those full
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:12.320]  rounds and we discussed well you know can we prolong those
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:15.680]  shots would that you know would that help and i'd love to have the answer from
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:19.120]  your guests on that but the final part of this story is it
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:24.080]  you know she starts going to she starts talking down to us and basically saying
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:27.600]  all these medical terms and you know you should listen to the cdc
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:32.880]  and and all that and then you know we kind of let it go for a second then
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:35.920]  finally she brings up well you need to have your son
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:38.960]  vaccinated for the flu and the in one nation one
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:42.160]  and we told her well you know no we don't want to do that
[2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:46.560]  and long story short she um she said we should get another physician
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:50.480]  another pediatrician 30 to 40 percent of the pediatrician saying
[2:13:50.480 --> 2:13:54.160]  they will not see their patients any longer if they don't submit their
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:56.880]  children to the vaccine and that's good they don't need your
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:00.560]  business you can find plenty just google in your area
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:05.360]  uh but it's patient abandonment they're not allowed to do this by law and this
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:08.880]  is this is terrible of course but you don't want to go to them to begin with
[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:12.320]  go there are a lot of physician there you can find a lot of physicians that
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:16.000]  won't push it on you go ahead the more we talk alex the more people want to go
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:19.760]  back to the doctor's math what they heard on the alex jones so is that true
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:24.160]  from the doctor the doctor is the purveyor he's the person who's
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:28.640]  selling the vaccine do not go there they've circled the wagons to protect
[2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:33.040]  the vaccine industry it's what drives people to the pediatrician's office
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:36.640]  without the vaccine income they haven't got any income
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:41.680]  so understand how all this works they know this you cannot rely
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:45.520]  on people like this if you were selling car batteries would you trust the guy
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:49.280]  who told you you need a new battery come on let's get real don't be
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:53.840]  don't be so naive it's important that you see through this
[2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:57.440]  if you can just feel confident it's some alternatives
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:00.720]  give your children a vitamin d now i have a little boy
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:05.200]  five years old you know with a temperature of one on one eight
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:09.280]  going up to a hundred and two six but that scares you until you give the
[2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:12.880]  vitamin d in 15 minutes later this child's at 98
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:17.360]  eight temperature so you need to see that in your own hand
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:22.240]  to see the let me expand on this one big thing that wakes parents up most
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:25.760]  doctors and nurses will lie and say no there's no
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:29.840]  mercury and then make them give you the insert and say it says mercury right
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:33.200]  there that'll shut them up but but bill
[2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:36.720]  how do they get so many doctors and nurses to lie
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:40.560]  why do they think lying is good it's their jobs
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.240]  you know this is their their income this is
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:49.040]  they have to circle the wagons on this and they've been asked to do that by
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:53.600]  you know the leaders in the pediatric area and so on because if the vaccine
[2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:57.120]  thing falls then they feel there'll be so much disease and they create some
[2:15:57.120 --> 2:16:00.960]  pretty good data on that but they don't see any alternative and they don't see
[2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:04.560]  where they're driving humanity yeah let's take another
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:10.320]  call tim in new york they're on the air go ahead tim
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:15.280]  here's my story this is a total case of eugenics in the works right now my
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:20.240]  fiance was uh taken august 4th 2008 real quick on
[2:16:20.240 --> 2:16:24.880]  her a mental health arrest by her family and uh basically they threw her into a
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:29.280]  psych ward for four months um and a side note she's suffering from a
[2:16:29.280 --> 2:16:32.720]  hypothyroidism which hasn't been treated to this day
[2:16:32.720 --> 2:16:35.840]  um they've given her a risper all miss initially
[2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:40.720]  to create like a brain fog um when she uh finally got out
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:44.560]  released from the psych ward she was supposed to be released back into the
[2:16:44.560 --> 2:16:47.600]  community and hopefully to you know live her life again
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:51.520]  instead the court appointed guardian went against the court order
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:56.800]  and they threw her into a nursing home and she's not allowed uh phone she's not
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:17:00.080]  allowed visitors she's not allowed flowers she's not allowed mail
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:03.440]  she has a radio frequency bracelet on her leg
[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:06.960]  she uh wants to get out of there nobody will help
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:11.520]  okay but sir we're doing flu today well they're trying to shoot her up with
[2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:16.080]  these vaccines repeatedly right now and they keep doing it keep coming into
[2:17:16.080 --> 2:17:19.040]  her room and trying to offer her these uh
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:23.200]  these flu shots and these tetanus shots yeah listen i exactly
[2:17:23.200 --> 2:17:27.280]  it is a medical tyranny and the and the and the medical
[2:17:27.280 --> 2:17:31.280]  tyranny wants to set the precedent to do whatever they want to us when they
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:34.240]  want look at all these articles where they're injecting people's kids
[2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:38.000]  even when they say no i mean there needs to be criminal charges doesn't their
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:41.280]  bill that's a serious crime to do this to these children
[2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:44.800]  isn't it interesting how nature is cooperating with the flu
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:51.120]  vaccine agenda i mean used to have a flu pandemic about every 30 years 1958
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:55.440]  and 19 uh you know it went uh 77 and then
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:58.640]  so on you see those dates there that they give you
[2:17:58.640 --> 2:18:04.160]  those dates all of a sudden got speeded up because 2001 to 2003 we had the h5
[2:18:04.160 --> 2:18:08.400]  n1 which killed 6 out of 10 people but unfortunately it wasn't very
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:11.520]  transmissible it didn't meet their agenda all of a
[2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:16.480]  sudden very shortly we have the h1 n1 pandemic strain
[2:18:16.480 --> 2:18:20.560]  nature is cooperating or is it or are they manipulating
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:25.840]  nature you need to ask flu viruses don't mutate like this they fizzle out by the
[2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:29.760]  way if you see a real flu pandemic that keeps going
[2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:34.240]  there's something else wrong that's why we're calling into question the 1918
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:37.760]  uh pandemic yeah that's what the medical doctors explain
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:42.400]  if you get a bad mutation it quickly replicates into something harmless very
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:45.200]  very quickly that's correct so when you see
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:48.720]  massive loss of death something else is going on
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:52.560]  like the aspirin use the vitamin c deficiency in 1918
[2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:55.920]  they can do this again and by the way you'll say well you know if a lot of
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:00.400]  people die of the flu they'll tell us they didn't in 1993 and
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:04.480]  thousands died of the shots would they do it again
[2:19:04.480 --> 2:19:09.120]  well you ask yourself if you're going to put your children on the line here by
[2:19:09.120 --> 2:19:12.160]  the way talk about putting yourself on the line
[2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:15.760]  my wife's worried about me going public like this
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:19.200]  i i know alex jones's wife must be worried
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:24.560]  listen we are out here risking ourselves i hope you people that are listening
[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:29.040]  and heed this what we're saying we've got nothing to gain out of this but look
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:33.200]  like fools if we're wrong we are begging you to back away from
[2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:36.400]  this vaccine agenda in our country for the good of your

[2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:21.120]  cracking down on us and then in the next hour
[2:24:21.120 --> 2:24:24.480]  the framework convention on climate change you've heard it's got world
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:27.760]  government in it well we're going to break it down
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:31.120]  section by section this is going to be key information
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:37.120]  coming up bill finishing up the points that you were making there
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:41.680]  the canadian government came out and admitted that the regular seasonal
[2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:45.680]  flu shot doubled your chances of getting h1n1
[2:24:45.680 --> 2:24:52.560]  the drug insert for the nasal flu vaccine admitted it can spread the flu
[2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:55.600]  so you said we're going out on a limb here that's the only thing you've said
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:58.560]  today i don't really agree with i mean we're out on the limb having the
[2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:03.120]  mainstream media attack us and say we're enemies and demonizes but
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:06.480]  i mean i've had countless medical doctors on you you linked to the research
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:10.080]  you cover it as a great health journalist
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:14.320]  well we're not out on a limb we're out of our turtle shell to tell people
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:18.800]  because we know what the truth is now i'm
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:23.360]  saying you know they could come back and send their tax man over here
[2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:27.280]  go through all my tax files or whatever other ways they come back and get you
[2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:31.040]  you know they they we found out they have the zip codes of all the
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:35.440]  the areas where there are vaccine objectors so they have that all
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:39.040]  mapped out where are the people that object to the vaccines they probably
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:43.760]  know them by name too so you know we're concerned about government
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:47.680]  you know attacking the people they know that we're making an impact out here
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:51.680]  now they want to shut down those the shows on the
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:54.960]  internet that are making an impact the general accounting
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:59.440]  office comes out with this phony report saying that too many people at home
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:03.280]  that are sick on the internet might overuse the bandwidth
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:06.160]  so therefore they have to shut parts of it down they know
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:12.640]  what this is having an impact by the way pigs get the flu and it's very mild
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:15.200]  and goes away in a few days and do you know why
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:18.800]  because pigs make their own vitamin C we don't we're humans
[2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:22.800]  we don't make our own vitamin C neither do guinea pigs and so on so
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:27.040]  you know you see the power but rats do but rats do and that was the old cure
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:30.400]  for sailors 500 years ago if you had scurvy
[2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:34.720]  eat rat guts well you know the vitamin C is very powerful
[2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:39.040]  for stopping the mortality now don't confuse it you'll still get the flu
[2:26:39.040 --> 2:26:42.320]  but you're probably not gonna succumb to this and by the way
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:45.840]  we have children my little boy goes into preschool
[2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:49.600]  and you know a bunch of the kids are sick and so on
[2:26:49.600 --> 2:26:54.320]  but we've noticed in that preschool there are only two children in that class
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:59.360]  that are very verbal my child and one other little girl and all the rest
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:03.680]  you can't get them to talk very much which two are the only ones that aren't
[2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:07.760]  vaccinated no vaccines my kid and that little girl
[2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:11.600]  when you are getting these vaccines it gives a little bit of disease
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:15.280]  these kids it's affecting their brain and their verbal skills that's where you
[2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:18.400]  can see it in the I agree listen most of the
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:22.240]  public are like retarded zombies now I've had all these medical doctors on
[2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:24.880]  that say every time you get shots your brain swells
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:28.880]  these are brain damaged children and their parents are brain damaged
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:31.520]  and that's why they can't even understand us right now bill
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:36.800]  they're brain damaged we've got fear riding patrol over us we've got to calm
[2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:39.600]  the fears down you know we should be more fearful of our
[2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:43.760]  government not not this flu be more fearful of the vaccine
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:47.120]  by the way this whole thing you know was here late
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:52.240]  starting in March through the year the flu season went south
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:56.880]  below the equator that's their flu season did it kill masses
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:28:02.240]  no so it was mild there what is all the hysteria over the government's
[2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:07.040]  beating this drum and saying you need the vaccine and they don't even have it
[2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:11.200]  and they're irresponsible for not making sure that your immune system is up to
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:15.120]  par with the proper vitamins nutrition minerals and so on
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:18.800]  so you and you even if you had the flu shot most likely won't work because
[2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:22.880]  your your nutrition is poor in most cases so
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:27.120]  if you all of this information documented and available to you as I've
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:30.000]  written it so and by the way stay away from the
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.600]  flu mist it is the disease it's the live
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:37.440]  virus now and there's no doubt they consciously put that out first
[2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:42.880]  to seed the public to use the human incubators to spread it
[2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:47.680]  there is no such thing as really live virus that needs your host cells to work
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:51.920]  but if you have good immunity then you know you'll have a bill it says on the
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:56.400]  side of the nasal it says live virus well when they say with the vaccine
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:00.480]  works a certain percentage it means largely it prevents
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:05.840]  what they call serological flu that is vaccine count the amount
[2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:09.040]  it they can no i understand i understand they have the irradiated or
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:13.120]  attenuated but i'm saying the nasal it says on the box live yeah
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:17.440]  when they say it's effective whether it's nasal or or the injected one they
[2:29:17.440 --> 2:29:21.680]  say well it's 30 to 50 effective most of that is
[2:29:21.680 --> 2:29:26.000]  if they're doing a blood test to find out if the virus is in your blood as far
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:31.920]  as ability to reduce symptoms very poor very hard bill sardy thank you so much

[2:31:21.200 --> 2:31:24.800]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:31:24.800 --> 2:31:28.800]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:16.160]  and congressman louis gohmert and congressman verne
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:19.120]  bucanon and countless others are coming out
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:23.680]  talking about world government and saying we don't want world government
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:27.040]  and then it's an authoritarian world government and then i see the mainstream
[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.440]  media make fun of them and call them conspiracy theorist
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:38.000]  when all they're doing is quoting the editorial out of the new york times
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:41.920]  written by the secretary general of the united nations
[2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:48.560]  calling for global government a deal must include an equitable global
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:55.520]  governance structure i mean these guys
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:37:00.800]  these guys openly write the treaties that openly say a private group has
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:05.840]  dictatorial unelected power over everything we do in our lives
[2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:09.760]  and then finally some congressmen start speaking out against it
[2:37:09.760 --> 2:37:14.480]  and the media says it doesn't exist see that's a stalling tactic they know it
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:17.440]  exist they know goldman sacks engineered the
[2:37:17.440 --> 2:37:20.560]  whole scam goldman sacks is the brain trust
[2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:24.480]  they're the private group that manages the federal reserve

[2:53:19.440 --> 2:53:23.120]  and americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:26.560]  prepare now ready reserve foods is the manufacturer

[2:54:10.720 --> 2:54:15.520]  well here's the deal the decisions been publicly made to start killing the
[2:54:15.520 --> 2:54:18.480]  dollar so the private central banks can just create
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:22.720]  unlimited currencies themselves bank to bank
[2:54:22.720 --> 2:54:27.040]  there will be no recovery there will be no jobs
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:30.480]  that is their open plan is to wreck our economy
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:36.320]  the global carbon framework is meant to expand that
[2:54:36.320 --> 2:54:40.160]  but she will get to be a cop who'll get to have the petty power to beat
[2:54:40.160 --> 2:54:42.720]  citizens to death that's the only jobs that are going to be
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:46.160]  expanded as bureaucrats and bloodsuckers and parasites
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:50.720]  so enjoy that here in the soviet america
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:54.080]  and the public's a bunch of animals too so the police will actually be needed
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:56.640]  too so that's the genius of this system
[2:54:56.640 --> 2:55:02.240]  turning everybody pure evil teaching everybody torture and murder is good
[2:55:02.880 --> 2:55:07.360]  don't worry everybody gets judged in this system everybody gets to get hurt
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:11.040]  all you servants of evil you're going to get to
[2:55:11.040 --> 2:55:16.320]  get to bathe in the cess you you you try to force us to live in
[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:20.480]  here's bloomberg today dollar falls as manufacturing grows
[2:55:20.480 --> 2:55:24.960]  oil copper gold rally i wanted to bring ted anerson up briefly to tell you
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:28.160]  about today's golden silver offer he still got
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:31.840]  gold way below what it's selling for even though it's way up
[2:55:31.840 --> 2:55:35.440]  and it's the only same thing to do is to buy golden silver and this is a great
[2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:39.200]  place to do it i've not seen deals better
[2:55:39.200 --> 2:55:44.000]  you can check it out for yourself but people probably rather have a 401k
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.480]  they're just going to take from you so go ahead and do that hell drink some
[2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:50.720]  fluoride while you're at it uh ted tell folks about the offers you've got today
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:53.920]  yeah sure will and i'll just add in if you want to kill the new world order real
[2:55:53.920 --> 2:55:56.800]  fast get away from their fiat currency and go to gold
[2:55:56.800 --> 2:55:59.440]  that's the machine that finances what they're doing
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:05.200]  but right now i have the frank at 236 british sovereigns are 291 i
[2:56:05.200 --> 2:56:10.240]  presently have the ten dollar liberty at 818 50 and the lakota coin at 22
[2:56:10.240 --> 2:56:14.320]  dollars and 30 cents sorry about the walking liberties they're sold
[2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:18.720]  um all i can say alex is i had a little tiny opportunity here to get into gold
[2:56:18.720 --> 2:56:22.480]  in the 1020 range i was able to back off a
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:25.520]  little bit on those british sovereigns and frank's because of it
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:29.760]  but uh the market is definitely strong and gold and silver the dollars falling
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:33.280]  just like you said uh today gold up i mean it's up almost
[2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:37.280]  12 dollars it spent as high as 1064 today
[2:56:37.280 --> 2:56:40.800]  one of these times it's going to break through that 1060 level
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:43.760]  and then next thing you know you're going to be looking at 1090
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:47.840]  and we're going to be looking back at 1060 and thinking what a great buy that
[2:56:47.840 --> 2:56:51.360]  is i wish i could get back to 900 and someone else
[2:56:51.360 --> 2:56:55.920]  could you imagine that a year ago i'd be thinking 900 and some is too much
[2:56:55.920 --> 2:56:59.040]  you know that this is what's going on the dollars falling in value
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:02.800]  we're losing purchasing power and of course we were right about all of that
[2:57:02.800 --> 2:57:05.520]  no one will listen they love their world government
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:09.040]  i mean i just hope people will call and get the gold and silver that's a fabulous
[2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:13.120]  deal so you're saying gold you bought at the 1020 level even
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:16.160]  though it's up at 1060 right now or close to it
[2:57:16.160 --> 2:57:19.840]  you're saying that's going to be sold out soon yeah sure it is of course because
[2:57:19.840 --> 2:57:24.240]  i only have so many resources i only can buy so much when the prices go down
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:27.600]  and and i wish people were smart enough to do the same but people have a tendency
[2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:30.160]  to turn away from gold no they want fluoride
[2:57:30.160 --> 2:57:33.040]  uh one eight hundred but there are a lot of smart people out there that will take
[2:57:33.040 --> 2:57:40.640]  action one 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 the brokers are there they'll
[2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:44.000]  be there till midnight ten yeah we'll be here till midnight we'll honor these
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:54.640]  transactions so 800 686 2237 golds at $1057 and 40 cents an ounce
[2:57:54.640 --> 2:58:00.000]  again 800 686 2237 10 i hope people take advantage of this
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:04.400]  and at least get into silver and gold because when the general public finally
[2:58:04.400 --> 2:58:07.520]  figures out they're killing the dollar you're not going to be able to find
[2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:09.440]  gold and silver even if you got the money
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:12.960]  well the reason why the federal reserve system is so powerful is because they
[2:58:12.960 --> 2:58:17.440]  have the ability to print money get to gold it takes that away from them
[2:58:17.440 --> 2:58:21.040]  well they also have a a nation of self-satisfied idiots
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:23.920]  they think they're in control of everything and love being conned and
[2:58:23.920 --> 2:58:27.520]  screwed more and more i realize the religion in america is
[2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:32.000]  worshiping slavery worshiping weakness worshiping being conned
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:34.960]  and defrauded people would have listened to us six
[2:58:34.960 --> 2:58:37.600]  years ago they'd have made almost four times their money back
[2:58:37.600 --> 2:58:50.560]  800 686 2237 you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[2:58:51.840 --> 2:58:55.840]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[2:58:55.840 --> 2:58:59.040]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[2:58:59.040 --> 2:59:03.040]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[2:59:03.040 --> 2:59:06.240]  americans at home i've turned the members influence
[2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:10.640]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:14.880]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay
[2:59:14.880 --> 2:59:17.520]  attention for the republic identifies the
[2:59:17.520 --> 2:59:20.960]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[2:59:20.960 --> 2:59:25.120]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[2:59:25.120 --> 2:59:27.920]  government tim geithner bernanke their arsonists
[2:59:27.920 --> 2:59:31.200]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[2:59:31.200 --> 2:59:34.000]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:37.520]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:31.360]  this is the hitlerian crap we're facing
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:39.120]  the globalist look at the brain damage mindless public and they see
[3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:42.080]  animals that they're going to be able to have their way with
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:45.200]  and i see a lot of damaged people but i know we can resurrect something out of
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:48.640]  this and there's enough thinkers still left who aren't on the bad guys team
[3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:51.440]  to beat these people
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:55.360]  but the crimes that have been committed against this species
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:02:11.840]  make my very fabric boil
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:15.520]  i'm going to cover the global treaty
[3:02:16.160 --> 3:02:19.040]  and we come back
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:28.000]  and then towards the end of the show i want to illustrate
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:32.960]  how they take your dreams away and how they've turned many people into empty
[3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:40.480]  husk how they literally steal your humanity away from you

[3:03:32.640 --> 3:03:36.640]  once you get sold on a little bit of denial you can't admit you're wrong
[3:03:36.640 --> 3:03:39.920]  you're invested in the system you're invested in the lies so you keep going

[3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:04.640]  operate and to trade carbon credits al gore is one of the chief
[3:11:04.640 --> 3:11:11.040]  owners of one of the five companies he's invested in three of the other four
[3:11:11.040 --> 3:11:16.160]  the gi in headed by anthony bug levin the current director of the rockerfiller

[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:28.400]  world change the global impact investing network
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:32.320]  this is one of the chief sponsors and coordinators of the un treaty that's
[3:11:32.320 --> 3:11:38.240]  coming up but let's go to the treaty itself
[3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:43.680]  first i just want to add though that rather than debate these real issues
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:47.280]  and let the american people debate whether or not they want an
[3:11:47.280 --> 3:11:51.440]  unelected unaccountable private corporate board ruling all
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:58.080]  carbon activity on the planet
[3:11:58.080 --> 3:12:01.440]  rather than have a real debate about this the media out of one side of their
[3:12:01.440 --> 3:12:06.240]  mouth says that none of this exist and there's no
[3:12:06.240 --> 3:12:09.920]  world government and that there's no plan for a carbon tax
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:12.720]  while they've already passed the legislation
[3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:18.000]  that is designed to tie into the copenhagen treaty
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:21.520]  and while they're openly announcing according to even the la times
[3:12:21.520 --> 3:12:26.080]  there will be a tax on all food there will be taxes on
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:28.880]  your dog because they have a big carbon footprint
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:32.160]  there will be taxes on all fossil fuels all plastics
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:37.120]  all industries and unelected private boards and government boards will do
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:40.080]  home inspections they want to shut down the coal
[3:12:40.080 --> 3:12:44.240]  plants that will more than double fuel costs the oil companies have written
[3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:47.840]  the plan the media always behaves as if
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:52.960]  they're against it they brag in the un documents they brag
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:55.040]  in the club of rome documents we've sourced here
[3:12:55.040 --> 3:12:58.400]  that this is meant to shut down industrial capacity so they can have an
[3:12:58.400 --> 3:13:02.640]  organized eugenics society to bankrupt everyone so
[3:13:02.640 --> 3:13:08.960]  everyone goes on government welfare and by everyone the vast majority
[3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:13.360]  this is the planned economy now we have two stacks here one is the government
[3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:16.080]  stack this is just where they mentioned global
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:19.040]  government and government
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:25.120]  this other stack is the tax stack of the divided up treaty
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:31.360]  i'm now going to go over this treaty here on air
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:36.560]  as much of the 200 pages as we have time to do
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:42.480]  framework convention on climate change from the government section let's look
[3:13:42.480 --> 3:13:45.360]  at page five
[3:13:46.640 --> 3:13:52.480]  and six pp2 acknowledge the findings of the fourth assessment report
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:56.960]  on intergovernmental panel on climate change ipc
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:14:01.920]  c you go read that global government global tax global regulatory systems
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:06.560]  run by private board p3 pp3 acknowledge the importance
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:10.240]  and role of Kyoto protocol and the need to broaden the legal
[3:14:10.240 --> 3:14:15.360]  commitments under the convention so it's ratified Kyoto through this
[3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:20.960]  current atmospheric concentrations are principally the result of historic
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:25.200]  emissions of greenhouse gases the largest share of which
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:30.000]  has originated or originated from develop countries and parties that means
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:33.360]  the u.s and europe they have to make the cuts not china not
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:37.360]  india not mexico that will further transfer all our industry there that's
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:41.600]  left as if detroit's collapse and california's
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:44.560]  collapse isn't enough
[3:14:45.280 --> 3:14:48.960]  even if you believe carbon dioxide that plants breathe as a deadly chemical
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:52.480]  weapon as they listed in the treaty as a toxic waste
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:55.520]  by moving it all to the third world they have no
[3:14:55.520 --> 3:14:58.960]  emission standards it will boost overhaul greenhouse gas emission
[3:14:58.960 --> 3:15:02.320]  they don't care about that they know it's actually good
[3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:05.280]  they want the tax
[3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:08.800]  they're also posing it in these documents as if this is going to help the
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:11.600]  third world as if they're they're taking from the
[3:15:11.600 --> 3:15:14.160]  rich giving to the poor now it's the private banks they're going to get all
[3:15:14.160 --> 3:15:18.880]  this money let's go to page 17 18 and 19
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:26.320]  17 18 and 19
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:31.440]  38 the scheme for a new institutional agreement under convention
[3:15:31.440 --> 3:15:34.320]  will be based on three basic pillars government
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:37.440]  facilitative mechanism that's how they force it
[3:15:37.440 --> 3:15:41.520]  and financial mechanism and the basic organization of which will include
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:47.280]  following the tax that's the funding mechanism financial mechanism the
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:50.800]  government will be ruled by the c o p with the support of the new
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:55.440]  subsidiary body of adaptation and of an executive board
[3:15:55.440 --> 3:15:58.400]  responsible for the management of the new funds
[3:15:58.400 --> 3:16:03.520]  and the related facilitated process in bodies this is unelected
[3:16:03.520 --> 3:16:08.320]  the current convention secretariat will operate as such as appropriate
[3:16:08.320 --> 3:16:12.960]  so just dictatorial power capability to do whatever they want
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:17.200]  the convention's financial mechanism will include a multinational climate
[3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:23.040]  change fund including five windows then it goes through all the different
[3:16:23.040 --> 3:16:29.520]  taxes let's go to page 22
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:37.600]  and here the countries agree the carbon dioxide is a poison
[3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:42.240]  agree that the taxes must be implemented agreed there must be a monetary
[3:16:42.240 --> 3:16:46.000]  census of all carbon activity and a regulatory system and we read the
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:50.400]  climate bill that's passed the house 35 agencies giving unlimited power
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:53.280]  to do whatever they want
[3:16:58.640 --> 3:17:02.720]  let's go to 142 and again i'm i'm just hitting
[3:17:02.720 --> 3:17:07.760]  a few of the points ladies and gentlemen this thing is incredible
[3:17:07.760 --> 3:17:16.880]  let's look at the tax sections here
[3:17:17.040 --> 3:17:29.280]  of this let's go to 164 let's go to 142 142 the ebftm will be supported by
[3:17:29.280 --> 3:17:33.280]  five technical panels research and development that's their hired
[3:17:33.280 --> 3:17:37.120]  scientists that make up all the lies for them capacity building transfer of
[3:17:37.120 --> 3:17:40.720]  technologies for mitigation redd plus and market
[3:17:40.720 --> 3:17:43.280]  mechanisms the technical panel shall comprise government
[3:17:43.280 --> 3:17:47.360]  representatives elected by the ceo p the private

[3:17:56.400 --> 3:18:01.840]  to be open to input from other experts that they select
[3:18:01.840 --> 3:18:10.960]  let's go to 164 here's 160 the annex one continues the country shall
[3:18:10.960 --> 3:18:14.160]  institute initiatives at the national level notably tax
[3:18:14.160 --> 3:18:18.640]  exemption and subsidies for the owner of patented technology with a view to
[3:18:18.640 --> 3:18:21.600]  promoting transfer and diffusion of the environmentally
[3:18:21.600 --> 3:18:24.960]  sound technologies to developing countries see they choose
[3:18:24.960 --> 3:18:30.720]  what gets to be developed and what gets tax incentives
[3:18:30.720 --> 3:18:35.440]  and we're just skimming the surface here of this nightmare
[3:18:35.440 --> 3:18:40.640]  here's 164 the executive body on technology shall comprise government
[3:18:40.640 --> 3:18:44.080]  representatives elected by the ceo p with balanced regional
[3:18:44.080 --> 3:18:47.040]  representation who are experts in matters related to technology development

[3:18:54.800 --> 3:18:58.480]  by the ceo p a multinational climate technology fund
[3:18:58.480 --> 3:19:01.520]  that's the big bank shall be established it will provide technology
[3:19:01.520 --> 3:19:05.520]  related financial requirements see you don't get the loans
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:09.040]  backed up by taxpayer money and the carbon tax unless you submit to them
[3:19:09.040 --> 3:19:13.200]  as determined by the executive body under ceo p
[3:19:13.200 --> 3:19:17.040]  there's a headline exxon ceo advocates emissions tax
[3:19:17.040 --> 3:19:20.480]  see their oil companies are behind this just like the insurance companies
[3:19:20.480 --> 3:19:24.000]  wrote the health care takeover bill

[3:22:17.360 --> 3:22:21.360]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[3:22:21.360 --> 3:22:26.640]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:22:26.640 --> 3:22:30.560]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:34.240]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty

[3:22:41.280 --> 3:22:45.120]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[3:22:45.120 --> 3:22:48.640]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[3:24:03.360 --> 3:24:10.240]  but it is the awareness itself that will drive the change and one of the ways it
[3:24:10.240 --> 3:24:15.360]  will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements
[3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:19.520]  but the many business leaders who have been present here
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:24.480]  are among those taking leadership in other ways
[3:24:24.480 --> 3:24:28.880]  we talked for example about uh... we heard it this morning about the efficiency
[3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:37.360]  and jerry made that point very well
[3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:43.680]  i'm going to do a part two on this tomorrow as well because
[3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:48.240]  this document also says the country's agree carbon dioxide is deadly
[3:24:48.240 --> 3:24:51.520]  the country's agree that any climate change is bad
[3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:54.560]  and that you're not supposed to have climate change on the earth when the
[3:24:54.560 --> 3:24:57.600]  climate is changing on all the planets and moons
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:01.920]  of the solar system continually it is a religion
[3:25:01.920 --> 3:25:04.800]  and they're and they're teaching the children in fact i sent you guys a
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:08.640]  cartoon did you see that cartoon i sent you
[3:25:08.640 --> 3:25:13.440]  uh... where they are teaching the australian kids that puppies drowned
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:19.520]  because of carbon dioxide
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:23.280]  and that all of this is bad
[3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:28.880]  we're going to play that later coming up
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:32.480]  but i mean i just randomly opened this to page 35
[3:25:32.480 --> 3:25:35.280]  part a it says recognizing that climate change
[3:25:35.280 --> 3:25:39.120]  is an additional burden to development when this whole thing is about
[3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:44.880]  deindustrialization and development as the u n states in its own documents
[3:25:44.880 --> 3:25:49.440]  it says applying climatic information in sectoral planning
[3:25:49.440 --> 3:25:53.840]  as well as in cross sectoral planning such as integrated water resources
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:25:56.400]  management and then you read what that means it means the
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:26:00.880]  international body will determine how much water can be used in your
[3:26:00.880 --> 3:26:07.920]  country or nation i mean this is a power grab over everything
[3:26:07.920 --> 3:26:11.200]  the technical panel shall comprise government representatives elected by
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:15.840]  the ceo p so this private u n group it will decide
[3:26:15.840 --> 3:26:19.120]  who gets to be chosen
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:26.320]  and right now i'm going over the stack that uh...
[3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:33.200]  covers tax and i'm continuing here on page
[3:26:33.200 --> 3:26:38.960]  170 let's go to 171 transfer of technologies for mitigation and
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:42.480]  market mechanisms see they will decide what can be in the market
[3:26:42.480 --> 3:26:46.480]  technical panels comprise government representatives elected by ceo p
[3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:50.480]  but all the real meat is in these documents how it's going to control
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:53.520]  everything how private banks and promote joint
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:58.240]  ventures to accelerate development see only select corporate groups
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:02.000]  will be able to get the business because it's given to them by the u n
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:05.680]  panel and then they will control the big banks will control
[3:27:05.680 --> 3:27:08.560]  what infrastructure can be put in and what infrastructure
[3:27:08.560 --> 3:27:12.000]  can't be put in and the most important facet is
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:15.520]  all of the signatories have to vote unanimously
[3:27:15.520 --> 3:27:20.000]  to let any one party out of it or to amend it
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:24.560]  it'll never happen so it gives total dictatorial power
[3:27:24.560 --> 3:27:28.320]  to this private body
[3:27:28.320 --> 3:27:32.320]  listen to this this is from page 35
[3:27:32.320 --> 3:27:35.760]  part 5 improved emergency response capabilities including
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:39.920]  governance structures that encourage effective use of coordination of local
[3:27:39.920 --> 3:27:44.000]  national and international resources
[3:27:44.560 --> 3:27:47.440]  down here at the bottom
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:52.720]  so this is the type
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:57.600]  of nightmare that we're talking about and that we're discussing right here at
[3:27:57.600 --> 3:28:01.440]  the bottom if you want to show people on tv
[3:28:01.440 --> 3:28:06.080]  and it's all written in this dry language
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:11.920]  improved knowledge of socioeconomic aspects of climate change and promote
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:16.000]  the integration of socioeconomic information into impact and vulnerability
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:19.760]  assessments so see it's just into every law every local rule
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:22.880]  it makes it a religion
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:31.520]  over and over and over again
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:38.800]  it details this entire program let's just go over the tax sections
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:41.680]  page 35
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:45.120]  of the framework convention on climate change and this
[3:28:45.120 --> 3:28:49.440]  is what the congress has already passed in the house draconian rules
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:54.560]  that match up with this and it states the nation states
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:29:00.160]  have to pass accompanying laws to line up with it
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:04.560]  so let's look at page 35
[3:29:07.280 --> 3:29:12.080]  provide incentives to adaptation see they tax you if you don't do this and
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:16.320]  they tax you even if you do legislative changes removal of barriers
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:20.080]  that means borders and local state and federal laws
[3:29:20.080 --> 3:29:24.720]  provide incentives to adaptation through
[3:29:24.720 --> 3:29:28.080]  legislative changes removal of barriers involving women
[3:29:28.080 --> 3:29:31.280]  as active participants means get sex is divided
[3:29:31.280 --> 3:29:35.600]  and other supportive approaches minimize incentives that encourage
[3:29:35.600 --> 3:29:38.960]  malaptation that means if you don't do it they tax you
[3:29:38.960 --> 3:29:42.560]  reduce pervasive incentives that encourage
[3:29:42.560 --> 3:29:46.480]  unsustainable land use harassing your property taxing you if you
[3:29:46.480 --> 3:29:50.000]  don't follow their orders and reducing negative economic incentives
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:55.280]  tax breaks we're on the march the empire's on the run
[3:29:55.280 --> 3:30:00.720]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:00.720 --> 3:30:03.760]  the illusion created by the power elite is a lie
[3:30:03.760 --> 3:30:07.360]  that covers even the food they want you to eat will you continue to be their

[3:33:04.640 --> 3:33:08.480]  there was once a land where the weather was very very strange
[3:33:08.480 --> 3:33:12.640]  there were awful heat waves in some parts and in others terrible storms and
[3:33:12.640 --> 3:33:17.440]  floods scientists said it was being caused by too
[3:33:17.440 --> 3:33:20.240]  much co2 which went up into the sky when the
[3:33:20.240 --> 3:33:24.960]  grown-ups used energy they said the co2 was getting dangerous
[3:33:24.960 --> 3:33:28.320]  its effects were happening faster than they had thought
[3:33:28.320 --> 3:33:31.280]  some places could even disappear under the sea
[3:33:31.280 --> 3:33:33.760]  and it was the children of the land who'd have to live with the horrible
[3:33:33.760 --> 3:33:37.040]  consequences the grown-ups realized they had to do
[3:33:37.040 --> 3:33:40.880]  something they discovered that over 40 percent of
[3:33:40.880 --> 3:33:44.000]  the co2 was coming from ordinary everyday things like
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:49.120]  keeping houses warm and driving cars which meant if they made less co2
[3:33:49.120 --> 3:33:52.480]  maybe they could save the land for the children
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:57.840]  is there a happy ending it's up to us how the story ends
[3:33:57.840 --> 3:34:06.480]  see what you can do search online for act on co2
[3:34:06.480 --> 3:34:09.440]  that's the type of brainwashing going on everywhere
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:13.280]  puppy dogs grounding teaching children if it gets hot
[3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:17.120]  if it gets cold if there's any seasonal change
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:20.960]  that's abnormal but don't worry the global government's going to save you
[3:34:20.960 --> 3:34:25.920]  the bad grown-ups they create 40 percent of the co2
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:32.080]  the un's own cooked books and the big panel on climate
[3:34:32.080 --> 3:34:35.600]  change they put out two years ago most the scientists have gone public saying
[3:34:35.600 --> 3:34:39.600]  it's a fraud that we're even involved says that three percent
[3:34:39.600 --> 3:34:45.040]  of the increase in co2 is man-made ladies and gentlemen plants breathe it
[3:34:45.040 --> 3:34:50.800]  humans exhale it the the evil climate monster
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:34:54.880]  that they show in the children's book that they put on television
[3:34:54.880 --> 3:34:58.240]  talking to the public like we're children they have to show a big
[3:34:58.240 --> 3:35:01.280]  carbon monster up in the sky about to kill everybody
[3:35:01.280 --> 3:35:05.840]  they don't tell you it's humans exhaling it
[3:35:05.840 --> 3:35:10.240]  i mean it it it's such a giant fraud it's it's just
[3:35:10.240 --> 3:35:15.520]  so massive and right here on page 35 of the treaty
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:18.480]  it says provide incentives that means taxes
[3:35:18.480 --> 3:35:24.080]  to adaptation through legislative changes in the
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:28.560]  nations removal of barriers getting rid of sovereignty
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:33.280]  involving women as active participants making it a woman against the men thing
[3:35:33.280 --> 3:35:37.520]  and other supportive approaches minimize incentives that encourage
[3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:40.960]  malaptation means tax you if you don't do what they say
[3:35:40.960 --> 3:35:47.280]  reduce perverse incentives perverse that encourage unsustainable land use and
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:52.640]  reduce negative economic incentives tax breaks it
[3:35:52.640 --> 3:35:58.640]  says tax breaks for vulnerable activities
[3:35:58.640 --> 3:36:02.480]  so it's and and so they're announcing sheep cows your dog
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:06.560]  everything to be tax bureaucrats in your life a national ID card
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:10.320]  that registers what you buy and sell and putting you on

[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:04.320]  and then on australian tv they have this cartoon
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:09.200]  where it shows how the children need to commit suicide

[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:55.040]  that means loans to them at 30 interest with our money

[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:03.440]  developed countries parties and other developed parties include
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:08.480]  in the annex and then it goes in all the taxes taxes on carbon intensive

[3:41:12.960 --> 3:41:16.160]  only first world nations have to make that tax payment
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:24.400]  zoom in on this this is page 43 now only
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:27.840]  first world nations have to pay that that particular carbon tax
[3:41:27.840 --> 3:41:31.360]  all industry that hasn't left will go to the third world
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:35.360]  where they don't have those restrictions which will deindustrialize us
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:39.680]  further which is stated in fact will you get airing in here
[3:41:39.680 --> 3:41:44.000]  he was reading morris strong and david rocker filler quotes on friday show where
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:47.120]  they said in the 70s we're going to destroy our
[3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:50.640]  industry with a carbon tax to bring in total control
[3:41:50.640 --> 3:41:54.160]  certain nations will only be able to do certain things so everyone will be
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:41:57.680]  dependent on the globalist they will sit above the nation states
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:02.720]  so no nation state is self-sufficient so they control it
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:06.000]  come on in here erin erin i meant to get that article you wrote that had the
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:07.920]  footnotes and the links on the collapse of
[3:42:07.920 --> 3:42:10.800]  detroit where you had all the globalist quotes about how they were going to use
[3:42:10.800 --> 3:42:12.960]  fake environmentalism to wreck the economy
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:16.800]  the morris strong quotes the richard in haas quotes the
[3:42:16.800 --> 3:42:20.480]  will you print that run in here with them good job thank you the problem is
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:25.600]  we got too much evidence here taxes on carbon intensive products and
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:29.200]  services shares of proceeds of the clean development
[3:42:29.200 --> 3:42:34.800]  mechanism between members of the group
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:41.840]  it says you have to hire even locally risk management officials to come in and
[3:42:41.840 --> 3:42:45.520]  do an environmental assessment before you engage in any business
[3:42:45.520 --> 3:42:49.920]  activities that's on page 44 i mean my god ladies and gentlemen
[3:42:49.920 --> 3:42:56.000]  just to read this and to know it's coming up in 35 days
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:43:00.400]  it's going to page 64 here i mean this is just
[3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:08.320]  incredible page 64 progressive reduction
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:12.480]  or phasing out of market imperfection see this global regulator will do this
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:16.640]  they will decide financial incentives tax and duty
[3:43:16.640 --> 3:43:20.560]  exemptions and subsidies in all greenhouse gas emitting sectors that
[3:43:20.560 --> 3:43:23.840]  run counter to the objective of the convention
[3:43:23.840 --> 3:43:27.600]  and application of market instruments that's plain english
[3:43:27.600 --> 3:43:31.680]  if you don't do what they say they slap bigger and bigger taxes
[3:43:31.680 --> 3:43:37.120]  and they selectively decide just like the 14 000 plus pages of nafta and gat
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:40.800]  which was not free and open trade it was good old boys select
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:47.040]  deals page 83 this is just the tax sections
[3:43:47.040 --> 3:43:54.160]  page 83 i mean go read this become informed cap and trade schemes and
[3:43:54.160 --> 3:43:58.240]  carbon taxes and the use of new and existing flexible carbon
[3:43:58.240 --> 3:44:01.360]  markets meaning do whatever the hell they want when you're flexible it means
[3:44:01.360 --> 3:44:07.680]  that they're exempt including project and program based cdm
[3:44:07.680 --> 3:44:12.800]  cap and trade schemes and carbon taxes and it says this unelected ungroup
[3:44:12.800 --> 3:44:17.360]  it does whatever it wants in your country can't get out of it
[3:44:17.360 --> 3:44:20.720]  and they advertise this in the third world like ooh the rich americans you're
[3:44:20.720 --> 3:44:23.520]  going to get their money the same banks that have raped the third world are
[3:44:23.520 --> 3:44:26.080]  telling them this
[3:44:27.760 --> 3:44:39.280]  okay let's go to 134 on the tax section 134 page 134 of this treaty taxes on
[3:44:39.280 --> 3:44:43.920]  carbon intensive products and services and x1 parties
[3:44:43.920 --> 3:44:49.360]  and x1 parties are over 35 first world nations
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:55.120]  emission listen and then a list on dozens of pages i mean ladies and
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:44:58.160]  gentlemen i could do nothing but read this for
[3:44:58.160 --> 3:45:01.920]  the next month alternative one emissions from international
[3:45:01.920 --> 3:45:05.680]  aviation and maritime transport for journeys between developed countries
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:08.800]  may be auctioned through emission allowances on an international
[3:45:08.800 --> 3:45:13.840]  regulation scheme that's on page 134 and they state and this has been in the
[3:45:13.840 --> 3:45:18.160]  news that air travel must be rationed only
[3:45:18.160 --> 3:45:21.520]  england's about to pass laws so is the where you have to get government
[3:45:21.520 --> 3:45:24.080]  approval to travel in fact people won't believe me
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:26.800]  just random i'm showing people how fast they can look this up
[3:45:26.800 --> 3:45:30.960]  randomly google us or start page dot com whatever search engine
[3:45:30.960 --> 3:45:38.240]  search engine the term only essential travel to be allowed
[3:45:38.240 --> 3:45:43.840]  under greenhouse gas rules or air traffic must be curtailed under greenhouse gas
[3:45:43.840 --> 3:45:48.080]  emissions it's all in here and it says they have unlimited power in here
[3:45:48.080 --> 3:45:51.040]  see everything's dictatorial now and this is all
[3:45:51.040 --> 3:45:55.040]  mirrored in fact it's even worse this is just the general framework
[3:45:55.040 --> 3:45:58.400]  with what the nations are passing the house has passed
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:03.200]  the conforming legislation to this treaty they passed it three months ago
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:08.960]  before this treaty was even public this treaty has only been public for a month
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:13.920]  and they wouldn't let the public it's all covered in fall the republic
[3:46:13.920 --> 3:46:18.000]  they wouldn't let the public or the congress see it till they voted on it
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:23.680]  we have the clips from congress where this happened i mean
[3:46:23.680 --> 3:46:29.840]  these people are lawless scum taxes on carbon intensive products and
[3:46:29.840 --> 3:46:33.920]  services okay let's go to the next one here that's
[3:46:33.920 --> 3:46:38.560]  page 134 let's go to 160 this is just the taxes
[3:46:38.560 --> 3:46:44.400]  160 the annex one country shall institute incentives at the national level
[3:46:44.400 --> 3:46:50.080]  notably tax exemption and subsidies for the owner of the patented technology
[3:46:50.080 --> 3:46:53.600]  with a view to promoting transfer and diffusion of the environmentally sound
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:46:56.880]  technologies to the developed country so this means
[3:46:56.880 --> 3:47:01.120]  if you're a globalist and your company patents something it gets a tax exemption
[3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:06.080]  when nobody else does a totally controlled unfair market
[3:47:06.080 --> 3:47:08.400]  it's not enough for the bankers to be able to print all the money they want
[3:47:08.400 --> 3:47:11.120]  to buy off the planet they're the ones that wrote all this managing
[3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:15.120]  business travel emissions epa climate leaders partners meeting
[3:47:15.120 --> 3:47:18.880]  chicago there's one document click news though it was all over the news last
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:22.400]  week that you're gonna have to get a certification
[3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:26.240]  that you're that it's essential travel
[3:47:29.040 --> 3:47:33.440]  just type in air travel must be curtailed to cut greenhouse emissions
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:41.520]  that'll bring it up london guardian okay let's go to
[3:47:41.520 --> 3:47:45.040]  see what we do is we do our research right here on air we show everyone what
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:49.680]  i've already seen we show you this is not our opinion
[3:47:52.320 --> 3:47:56.880]  yeah you got to cut the first part off we just i just want
[3:47:56.880 --> 3:48:05.280]  yeah no it won't be travel london guardian it'll be uh the exact search term
[3:48:05.280 --> 3:48:14.320]  is air travel must be curtailed for environment or greenhouse gas
[3:48:14.320 --> 3:48:17.920]  okay continuing here they will decide where you fly what you do
[3:48:17.920 --> 3:48:23.520]  let's look at 173 173
[3:48:23.520 --> 3:48:29.760]  specific sources including parts of regular fiscal
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:33.040]  budget for research and development fiscal revenue
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:36.400]  from taxation on carbon transaction and or
[3:48:36.400 --> 3:48:40.960]  auction of emission permits in carbon market
[3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:45.840]  who owns the carbon market al gore as well as fiscal revenue from energy on
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:50.640]  environmental taxation in developed countries they
[3:48:50.640 --> 3:48:54.080]  will take your money the private banks will take your money
[3:48:54.080 --> 3:48:58.080]  and then loan it out they will take your tax money paid to their private group
[3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:01.280]  all parties shall ensure that interest payments made through the renewable
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:05.760]  energy and energy efficiency bond mechanism will be tax-free
[3:49:05.760 --> 3:49:09.440]  within their domestic jurisdiction
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:14.560]  the issuance of bonds the issuance of renewable energy and energy efficiency
[3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:18.640]  loans see the new green economy if you're one of the
[3:49:18.640 --> 3:49:22.000]  traders of these bonds it's tax-free so that'll
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:25.360]  that's unfair to other investments so see it forces everyone
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:36.560]  into this and a select few are going to make trillions of dollars
[3:49:36.560 --> 3:49:40.000]  so that's just some of what we're dealing with and that's not even the
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:43.120]  government section here's the glossary we wrote up for the
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:48.400]  taxes page 35 43 64 83 134 160 173
[3:49:48.400 --> 3:49:52.480]  175 that's just where the word that's just where they use the word taxes
[3:49:52.480 --> 3:49:58.640]  here's the government page 56 89 13 14 15 17 18 19 22 26 27
[3:49:58.640 --> 3:50:05.280]  41 42 and right through to 179 and it goes on look at this having
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:09.760]  children brings high carbon impact your children are bad
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:13.600]  google this tax people for having more than one child
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:18.720]  folks la times last week tax you for having a dog
[3:50:18.720 --> 3:50:22.960]  inspect your home shut down everything you're doing

[3:53:04.480 --> 3:53:08.480]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[3:53:08.480 --> 3:53:12.240]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:53:12.240 --> 3:53:15.840]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[3:53:15.840 --> 3:53:20.080]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:53:20.080 --> 3:53:23.760]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[3:53:23.760 --> 3:53:28.160]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[3:53:28.160 --> 3:53:32.080]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[3:53:32.080 --> 3:53:35.680]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[3:53:35.680 --> 3:53:39.600]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[3:53:39.600 --> 3:53:43.360]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[3:53:43.360 --> 3:53:47.120]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[3:53:47.120 --> 3:53:51.280]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[3:53:51.280 --> 3:53:55.280]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun
[3:53:55.280 --> 3:54:12.880]  so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[3:54:12.880 --> 3:54:15.920]  now you've just seen all this evidence and it's
[3:54:15.920 --> 3:54:19.360]  literally a drop in the bucket
[3:54:19.360 --> 3:54:26.640]  the united nations 1996 biological diversity assessment
[3:54:26.640 --> 3:54:32.640]  states they want an 80 force reduction in the population
[3:54:32.640 --> 3:54:37.520]  these people are diabolical but when congressman ron paul or congressman
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:44.880]  gohmert or congressman verne bucannon comes out and speaks out against this
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:51.360]  the media says it doesn't exist and they're insane and cnn gives them
[3:54:51.360 --> 3:54:56.400]  lunatic awards and and cnn every week now is playing clips of my show
[3:54:56.400 --> 3:55:00.720]  saying listen to this lunatic why because i can read the copenhagen
[3:55:00.720 --> 3:55:05.200]  treaty because i'm not watching the world series because i care about my kids is
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:09.280]  that why i'm bad you bastards selling out your fellow man
[3:55:09.280 --> 3:55:15.440]  you're not just not journalists you're a bunch of lion corporate whores
[3:55:15.440 --> 3:55:18.640]  and you'll attack people that'll tell me look here's the linen guardian
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:24.480]  we must agree to curtail air travel now if the copenhagen summit is to succeed
[3:55:24.480 --> 3:55:28.160]  i saw another headline where they're talking about canceling the world cup
[3:55:28.160 --> 3:55:32.480]  in johannesburg south africa and not allowing anyone to go there
[3:55:32.480 --> 3:55:37.280]  folks they don't care about making money they print the stinkin stuff
[3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:43.120]  they're going to train you to do this this is the most hardcore bondage
[3:55:43.120 --> 3:55:47.120]  that the world has ever seen and they admit
[3:55:47.120 --> 3:55:54.480]  its global government in their own framework and then lord mocton who are
[3:55:54.480 --> 3:55:57.680]  working on getting on the show
[3:56:00.960 --> 3:56:04.480]  he comes out and gives speeches and reads the subsections where it says global
[3:56:04.480 --> 3:56:08.160]  government and the media goes look at the crazy man and the media has the
[3:56:08.160 --> 3:56:12.240]  headline in the guardian lord mocton too extreme even for glenn beck
[3:56:12.240 --> 3:56:18.560]  because glenn beck had him on tv and then had bolton on former us ambassador to
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:21.680]  the un to say it wasn't true oh he's a republican
[3:56:21.680 --> 3:56:25.600]  it must not be true see glenn beck always does that he acts friendly
[3:56:25.600 --> 3:56:29.760]  and slits your throat right at the last minute oh there's no global government
[3:56:29.760 --> 3:56:35.040]  oh there's no there's no fema camps
[3:56:35.040 --> 3:56:38.160]  people love it they go well glenn beck says there's no global government so
[3:56:38.160 --> 3:56:41.440]  there mustn't be i mean i could show you al gore saying it
[3:56:41.440 --> 3:56:46.080]  in all their pro articles they admit it all but then when you say you don't want
[3:56:46.080 --> 3:56:48.400]  it they play this mind game with you and say it
[3:56:48.400 --> 3:56:51.200]  doesn't exist
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:56:56.800]  well campaign for liberties tell them the truth pull up that other article you
[3:56:56.800 --> 3:57:00.160]  had where they said
[3:57:00.160 --> 3:57:04.320]  you know where ron paul broke it down air travel you'll have to get permission
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:08.080]  but you already do you might be a terrorist no judge no jury no record
[3:57:08.080 --> 3:57:10.800]  no reason you just can't fly now they're saying no
[3:57:10.800 --> 3:57:16.080]  fly no buy a gun that's the name of the bill no fly no buy
[3:57:16.080 --> 3:57:19.200]  they're going for broke they've committed so many crimes
[3:57:19.200 --> 3:57:24.560]  why not commit a million more this is the real deal we have to call
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:28.000]  congress call the white house call talk radio
[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:31.040]  call all these shows letters to the editor
