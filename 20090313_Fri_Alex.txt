[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.840 --> 00:20.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.600 --> 00:28.960]  boy I tell you things are crazy around here Chuck Morris told me he'd come on the show anytime
[00:28.960 --> 00:38.240]  that he'd been listening for many years first time I had him on late last year and I just
[00:38.240 --> 00:44.280]  hadn't talked to call him or email him since he was on with us and then I got blindsided
[00:44.280 --> 00:49.000]  with this big announcement that he might run for the president of Texas and that both parties
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.640]  are controlled by elite groups and the IRS is a fraud and when I heard Beck Glenn Beck
[00:55.640 --> 01:00.320]  was involved that's just one of the hosts that's involved you know I don't have a very
[01:00.320 --> 01:03.760]  high view of Beck because he said Ron Paul supporters need to have the army used against
[01:03.760 --> 01:08.520]  him and her terrorist and now he's backed off of that but he mixes a lot of propaganda
[01:08.520 --> 01:11.880]  and what he does so I was at the end of the show and somebody brought that up and I confirmed
[01:11.880 --> 01:16.360]  that Chuck Norris had said these things was having this big simulcast today at five o'clock
[01:16.360 --> 01:24.760]  eastern I should have headed to the bottom of it so I went in and emailed Chuck and I left
[01:24.760 --> 01:31.040]  at about six boom he emailed right back we missed the email saying yeah I'd love to come
[01:31.040 --> 01:36.600]  on tomorrow at one o'clock is good for me is that good for you and so we just emailed
[01:36.600 --> 01:42.680]  him back this is the one day that the producer got here late in the month he's worked here
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.800]  that's how Murphy's law works he just walked in and so I hope they get the email confirming
[01:47.800 --> 01:53.920]  in time to have him on for the big announcement as he said there's some big announcement is
[01:53.920 --> 02:01.960]  it running for president is it calling for secession who knows I got in here early this
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.400]  morning for me and I need to just start getting in the producer email myself I'm not bashing
[02:06.400 --> 02:13.320]  anybody it's just this is the Murphy's law it drives me crazy because well here's the
[02:13.320 --> 02:17.640]  headline I may run for the president of Texas and since then last time I did more research
[02:17.640 --> 02:21.560]  on what he's been saying and it looks good I mean there's a global elite they're manipulating
[02:21.560 --> 02:28.280]  the banks people need to get into gold he says he should have the IRS is a fraud Obama's
[02:28.280 --> 02:35.840]  a socialist taking over both parties are controlled there's a new world order basically so it looks
[02:35.840 --> 02:41.240]  like we've done our work waking Chuck Norris up I remember 10 years ago having police officers
[02:41.240 --> 02:49.280]  in Houston Dallas and Austin the Chuck's got a couple places one in Central Texas one
[02:49.280 --> 02:56.040]  in South Texas and a house up in Dallas you know tell me about it and then we got some
[02:56.040 --> 03:03.440]  contacts from Chuck Norris himself and confirmed and I know he's been a big Republican supporter
[03:03.440 --> 03:06.520]  because on the surface obviously looks better than the Democrats are openly socialist at
[03:06.520 --> 03:12.480]  least that's what they push they're really banker bag men so we'll see if Chuck Norris
[03:12.480 --> 03:18.000]  is going to be on the show today I mean they said yes we'll come on yes is this time good
[03:18.000 --> 03:26.480]  but they're so busy who knows with two hours notice if that will happen because obviously
[03:26.480 --> 03:30.520]  I can have him on next week I can have him on this Sunday but I want him on ahead of
[03:30.520 --> 03:40.280]  this simulcast today because he's talking about very very exciting very very dynamic
[03:40.280 --> 03:46.760]  and extremely interesting things right now and I want to ask him about what he means
[03:46.760 --> 03:59.080]  by right wing cell groups around the country and so we'll be discussing that a lot more
[03:59.080 --> 04:05.560]  with him today my gut is he's going to be on the show so he definitely have been on
[04:05.560 --> 04:09.720]  if we'd have gotten that email last night but I guess I just need to stay here continually
[04:09.720 --> 04:17.280]  police trained nationwide that informed Americans are domestic terrorists that's the headline
[04:17.280 --> 04:26.560]  in a story up on prisonplanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson Kurt Nemo and Alex Jones and
[04:26.560 --> 04:33.360]  Rob do also contributed to this report and when we come back I'm going to go through
[04:33.360 --> 04:39.120]  this because it's not just about the stories in Ron Paul and libertarian supporters and
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.000]  Bob our supporters are terrorists that want to kill police it's also the denial because
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.320]  I got a lot of emails and web post and I'm still getting I'm saying this is all fake
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.760]  we've given you the names of the state police we talked to them they confirmed this is real
[04:54.760 --> 04:59.360]  I mean the police at the state we call the state police office in Missouri stay with

[09:57.160 --> 10:00.840]  it's not real just like i'm a liar there's no new world order and i'm a liar there's
[10:00.840 --> 10:05.680]  no bill derberg group and i'm a liar there's no cfr and i'm a liar and lindsay williams
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.160]  is a liar he didn't really say oil prices you know seven months ago we're going to drop

[10:30.080 --> 10:33.600]  much as i could even though it's good for the show it's more buzz goings people learn
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.600]  about delivery issues it's that what he's talking about is rebellion against the new
[10:37.600 --> 10:45.280]  world order so i am very very excited hi rob we are set for one p.m. central center time
[10:45.280 --> 10:55.440]  thanks so much chuck norris well that's nice
[10:55.440 --> 10:57.440]  what a gentleman okay
[10:57.440 --> 11:00.280]  back to what i was covering
[11:00.280 --> 11:04.160]  i can't handle it sometimes that
[11:04.160 --> 11:08.920]  people say we exaggerate when nine times out of ten it's the other way around
[11:08.920 --> 11:10.280]  yeah about
[11:10.280 --> 11:13.880]  ten percent of the time we end up overestimating what's happening with
[11:13.880 --> 11:17.320]  something but most of the time i'm probably more than ninety percent it's far worse than
[11:17.320 --> 11:20.320]  we say
[11:20.320 --> 11:24.360]  and hindsight if you listen to the show for years and see my films made one of my films
[11:24.360 --> 11:27.560]  made twelve years ago
[11:27.560 --> 11:31.640]  well i i i i keep saying i'm on there thirteen years wait a minute if i put up my first film
[11:31.640 --> 11:35.440]  in early ninety seven
[11:35.440 --> 11:42.000]  i have been making films for twelve years i've been on air fourteen years
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.400]  since nineteen ninety five that is just amazing
[11:45.400 --> 11:48.920]  the issue here is is it isn't about alex jones people saying i'm a liar people saying we
[11:48.920 --> 11:54.720]  make stuff up or saying we exaggerate it's that i am sick of them lying when they never
[11:54.720 --> 11:55.840]  have proof
[11:55.840 --> 11:57.520]  that i'm a liar
[11:57.520 --> 12:01.960]  out there trying to neutralize people from waking up and finding out the reality of
[12:01.960 --> 12:06.040]  what's really going on in this country
[12:06.040 --> 12:10.000]  but i got news for you out there uh... people aren't listening to your bull anymore and
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.980]  they know we told the truth
[12:11.980 --> 12:16.080]  and everybody's talking about revolution rebellion of the new world order
[12:16.080 --> 12:19.880]  and it's about time i just hope it's peaceful
[12:19.880 --> 12:26.600]  so here is the new article by paul watson curtain on alex jones up on
[12:26.600 --> 12:30.840]  present planet dot com right now police trained nationwide
[12:30.840 --> 12:34.960]  that informed americans are domestic terrorist
[12:34.960 --> 12:38.640]  a secret report distributed by the missouri information analysis center of the
[12:38.640 --> 12:39.880]  state
[12:39.880 --> 12:44.040]  i would add that list ron paul supporters libertarians people who display bumper
[12:44.040 --> 12:48.280]  stickers people who on gold or even people who fly u.s. flag
[12:48.280 --> 12:51.560]  and equates them with radical race hate groups and terrorist
[12:51.560 --> 12:52.600]  and this
[12:52.600 --> 12:55.480]  is merely the latest example in an alarming trend
[12:55.480 --> 12:59.800]  which confirms that law enforcement across the country is being trained
[12:59.800 --> 13:01.440]  that american citizens
[13:01.440 --> 13:04.880]  are a dangerous enemy oh it says we're gonna kill them every page
[13:04.880 --> 13:08.640]  a copy of the m i a c report was sent to us by an anonymous missouri police officer
[13:08.640 --> 13:11.520]  oh by the way i was busy dealing with the check north stuff the state police
[13:11.520 --> 13:13.760]  officer one of them wants to come on
[13:13.760 --> 13:15.480]  execute that immediately
[13:15.480 --> 13:19.300]  well we didn't just believe this when we had his card
[13:19.300 --> 13:21.000]  we called up
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.720]  from a separate phone so they couldn't connect it to him and
[13:23.720 --> 13:27.320]  as if he was there and know he was out on patrol
[13:27.320 --> 13:30.320]  so that's how we also operate but it matter we call the state police
[13:30.320 --> 13:33.760]  themselves and they've admitted this is their document but
[13:33.760 --> 13:36.680]  regardless
[13:36.680 --> 13:39.160]  regardless
[13:39.160 --> 13:40.440]  we're going
[13:40.440 --> 13:43.320]  to have him on in fact pull the trigger on that anytime he wants except for
[13:43.320 --> 13:49.440]  during the check north's interview
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.800]  now let me give you the names of the state police commanders over this
[13:53.800 --> 13:57.800]  operation who are the spokesman so you can call them on the telephone
[13:57.800 --> 14:00.320]  and the phone numbers posted on the site
[14:00.320 --> 14:04.000]  and you can confirm that it is the missouri state police that the denial
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.080]  needs to end now
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.280]  a copy of the m i c report was sent to us by an anonymous missouri police
[14:12.280 --> 14:15.440]  officer well it wasn't anonymous to us for you to change that
[14:15.440 --> 14:17.080]  not anonymous
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.200]  we're just protecting his identity as a source
[14:20.200 --> 14:22.600]  it was sent to us by two
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.120]  a copy of the m i a c report was sent to us by an anonymous missouri police
[14:26.120 --> 14:29.520]  officer paul please this is a good article i know you just just change it
[14:29.520 --> 14:31.040]  updated
[14:31.040 --> 14:34.600]  a copy of the m i a c report was sent to us by an anonymous missouri officer
[14:34.600 --> 14:37.400]  who was concerned by its content
[14:37.400 --> 14:39.880]  well yeah he said in his note
[14:39.880 --> 14:43.840]  that i guess he he's a terrorist now basically because he sports ron paul
[14:43.840 --> 14:46.840]  perhaps due to the outlandish and shocking nature of the document some
[14:46.840 --> 14:49.720]  people are still having difficulty believing it's real unfortunately have
[14:49.720 --> 14:51.480]  confirmed that it's one hundred percent
[14:51.480 --> 14:52.240]  genuine
[14:52.240 --> 14:54.040]  it's bona fide
[14:54.040 --> 14:57.080]  we spoke with captain hall wouldn't give us his first name at the missouri
[14:57.080 --> 14:58.920]  state highway patrol
[14:58.920 --> 15:02.960]  who told us that the m i a c strategic report is a part
[15:02.960 --> 15:05.680]  of a normal
[15:05.680 --> 15:07.840]  operations for officers
[15:07.840 --> 15:12.320]  to receive these periodic reports for safety purposes and to track
[15:12.320 --> 15:17.440]  friends or changes that was written down by a reporter and producer
[15:17.440 --> 15:18.560]  rob doing the phone with it
[15:18.560 --> 15:21.800]  all added the report was for the purposes of training their officers
[15:21.800 --> 15:23.680]  we also spoke with lieutenant
[15:23.680 --> 15:25.200]  john holts
[15:25.200 --> 15:28.280]  who along with captain hold declined to appear on the alice jones show to talk
[15:28.280 --> 15:29.360]  about the document
[15:29.360 --> 15:31.720]  view the document below
[15:31.720 --> 15:34.600]  uh... paul i i just want to update it that it was not anonymous this officer
[15:34.600 --> 15:38.720]  had a lot of courage one of the other officers was anonymous
[15:38.720 --> 15:39.680]  well he said
[15:39.680 --> 15:42.640]  keep my anonymity the other guy didn't but we are
[15:42.640 --> 15:45.560]  and now we talk to him he doesn't keep his anonymity that was an easy guess
[15:45.560 --> 15:48.240]  and add that in and and i want you to add
[15:48.240 --> 15:51.760]  a link right there to the website of the state police

[35:54.680 --> 35:59.080]  and the people are thirsty for the truth all over the nation all over the world
[35:59.080 --> 36:02.680]  we are living the true second american revolution a worldwide
[36:02.680 --> 36:09.080]  revolution against tyranny and i know that my forebears my forefathers
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.200]  are proud of what i'm doing looking down from heaven
[36:12.200 --> 36:16.440]  i know my ancestors would be proud of me not that i'm perfect
[36:16.440 --> 36:20.920]  and that's why in my life you know i try to live an upright life i don't try to
[36:20.920 --> 36:23.800]  be worldly i even feel guilty when i go out and
[36:23.800 --> 36:26.760]  once a month i need a big old steak or something
[36:26.760 --> 36:32.280]  but i'm not working but i do the best job i possibly can and i appreciate my
[36:32.280 --> 36:35.080]  crew doing that as well and all of you out there that are spreading the word
[36:35.080 --> 36:39.000]  because we are making major headway against the new world order
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.920]  more and more and it's just so exciting and believing we can win
[36:42.920 --> 36:47.400]  knowing we can win is infectious and the police in the military the
[36:47.400 --> 36:50.680]  establishment has reached when they teach them the founding fathers are bad
[36:50.680 --> 36:53.880]  and gun owners are bad and the gun control is good
[36:53.880 --> 36:56.840]  and that you know people that ron paul stickers want to kill you
[36:56.840 --> 37:02.200]  i mean literally saying this the police aren't stupid at least most of them
[37:02.200 --> 37:04.520]  aren't you know they're drawn from the general public so there are a lot of
[37:04.520 --> 37:07.720]  dumb ones just like there are everywhere you can go to a
[37:07.720 --> 37:11.320]  find dumb doctors dumb lawyers whatever they try to hire thugs they're on petty
[37:11.320 --> 37:14.440]  power trips but and some guys are on thugs when they're
[37:14.440 --> 37:18.440]  young and they grow out of it the point is is most of them are just so scared to
[37:18.440 --> 37:21.400]  death of the citizens and that somebody's going to shoot them or kill them
[37:21.400 --> 37:24.760]  when statistically it's not that big of a threat to all the i mean getting run over
[37:24.760 --> 37:27.320]  in their squad car getting hit by cars a real threat
[37:27.320 --> 37:30.760]  10-15 times depending on the year statistics in that way
[37:30.760 --> 37:36.040]  but i don't know just so much is going on and i know we can win this thing
[37:36.040 --> 37:39.720]  okay i said i was going to cover a key piece of the new world order
[37:39.720 --> 37:42.680]  and i'm going to do that briefly right now and then go to your phone calls
[37:42.680 --> 37:47.640]  charles free bird nate john andrew and others
[37:47.640 --> 37:56.440]  1-800-259-9231 okay you know i didn't have all this figured out
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.200]  15 years ago 16 years ago when i was a political activist 14 years ago when i
[38:00.200 --> 38:02.760]  got on air i still don't have it all figured out
[38:02.760 --> 38:07.720]  but i learned more and more every single day
[38:07.720 --> 38:12.680]  and a lot of this is just pure research and i would go read on the united
[38:12.680 --> 38:18.760]  nations website before i had to go to the library
[38:18.760 --> 38:25.480]  but by the late 90s i would go to the un website
[38:25.480 --> 38:27.960]  and i would read what think tanks were saying i go pull up the original
[38:27.960 --> 38:31.800]  document and they after well let me go to the root of
[38:31.800 --> 38:36.360]  this hitler was horrible hitler was bad
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.560]  but if you study the deep history that's even in mainstream
[38:39.560 --> 38:44.280]  Pulitzer prize winning books and i've listed a lot of those about world war
[38:44.280 --> 38:48.680]  2 written by germans written by french written by british written by us
[38:48.680 --> 38:51.880]  it is a documented fact of congressional hearings about this
[38:51.880 --> 38:55.160]  like there are hundreds of new york times and watching post articles
[38:55.160 --> 38:58.840]  in the 30s 40s and 50s on this and trials as well but
[38:58.840 --> 39:02.280]  we cover some of that in martial law rise the police state
[39:02.280 --> 39:06.120]  it's been about an hour on it actually a three-hour film
[39:06.120 --> 39:13.880]  that the bush family the harramans the jp morgens and others on record
[39:13.880 --> 39:18.120]  loved hitler i mean right even before he got elected he they loved him
[39:18.120 --> 39:21.800]  and the reason they loved him was the millner group the most powerful group
[39:21.800 --> 39:25.400]  out of the bank of england that runs our fellow reserve
[39:25.400 --> 39:29.800]  they are you look they're smart i mean these people are geniuses it's why
[39:29.800 --> 39:33.240]  they're in control but they're evil they're evil geniuses
[39:33.240 --> 39:36.680]  what are we doing today pinky the same thing we do every day
[39:36.680 --> 39:39.560]  conquer the world
[39:40.200 --> 39:43.640]  you know everybody wants to rule the world the song goes well no actually
[39:43.640 --> 39:47.720]  every powerful control freak does and so good people stand out and evil takes
[39:47.720 --> 39:51.400]  over and that's the problem in history
[39:51.400 --> 39:54.360]  and so the millner group wrote these are public documents i've read among
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.000]  coast to coast am i've posted them at info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.800]  they said in the like 19 19 19 20 the end of world war one they said
[40:05.800 --> 40:09.800]  we're gonna put incredible sanctions on germany bankrupt their old empire
[40:09.800 --> 40:13.000]  even though it was the british royalties cousins and the and the russian royalty
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.960]  with their cousins they said we're gonna go overthrow russia
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.600]  they've just done that they're stuff from 1910 1914 1918 but there's a bunch of
[40:20.600 --> 40:24.040]  documents you can go read them they're public the minutes of the millner group
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.480]  lord millner roundtable group you know there's a cfr here in the u.s but
[40:29.480 --> 40:34.040]  this was the upper echelon of that and
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.560]  we will then go and pick out of all these desperate groups over there
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.800]  well they said number one is we squeeze and crush them
[40:43.800 --> 40:47.160]  we're going to run the fake communist revolution in russia
[40:47.160 --> 40:51.080]  so the people think it's going to work as paradise will kill the royal cousins
[40:51.080 --> 40:55.480]  there takeover so we can run all that but then that'll be a big
[40:55.480 --> 40:59.240]  threat with the engine of russia so in the great game as they call it
[40:59.240 --> 41:02.120]  of balkanization divide and conquer will then play
[41:02.120 --> 41:08.600]  a fascist or right wing movement off against russia using the old empire
[41:08.600 --> 41:12.440]  because if we don't the socialist and communist will take over germany
[41:12.440 --> 41:16.120]  and our own revolution will get too big for us and we don't want
[41:16.120 --> 41:19.320]  all of europe western europe falling we just want eastern europe to have an
[41:19.320 --> 41:22.360]  extermination program
[41:22.440 --> 41:28.760]  and so they created hitler the highest levels of british intelligence in
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.480]  control of german intelligence this is on record
[41:31.480 --> 41:39.080]  went and got the young army corporal as early as 1920 by the mid 1920s they
[41:39.080 --> 41:44.840]  met in the leader of the nazi party the royalty of germany put in the crown
[41:44.840 --> 41:50.600]  prince publicly financing the crown publicly financing the prince who
[41:50.600 --> 41:54.360]  later became king for a short time from england traveled and financed hitler
[41:54.360 --> 41:57.240]  from the mid 20s
[41:58.280 --> 42:01.160]  heller was given hundreds of millions of dollars in gold
[42:01.160 --> 42:04.920]  weapons systems uh you know even some smaller
[42:04.920 --> 42:09.240]  artillery aircraft to fly around germany
[42:09.240 --> 42:15.800]  he was run into power in 1933 and the whole time the millner group
[42:15.800 --> 42:20.760]  set him up told him to invade poland told him to invade czechoslovakia told
[42:20.760 --> 42:23.160]  him to invade and said this is going to be a
[42:23.160 --> 42:26.920]  greater world germania the king was publicly a nazi at the time he had to
[42:26.920 --> 42:29.880]  advocate it wasn't over marrying that woman
[42:29.880 --> 42:33.240]  this is all public record public record hundreds of mainstream books you know
[42:33.240 --> 42:36.600]  encyclopedia you name it you know the king
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.520]  hiling hitler with hitler and all the rest of it
[42:41.160 --> 42:45.480]  they had the netherlands go pro-nazi being led by prince burnhard
[42:45.480 --> 42:50.520]  married to queen betricks hitler was invited to invade at
[42:50.520 --> 42:56.120]  dunkirk the british all evacuated that's why uh they stood the military down
[42:56.120 --> 42:59.880]  and everyone noticed that it came out later that herman gearing said bomb
[42:59.880 --> 43:02.920]  out past the ships don't really bomb them just make it look like we're
[43:02.920 --> 43:06.600]  bombing them that came out remember that
[43:06.600 --> 43:10.440]  the evacuation at dunkirk they only used the
[43:10.440 --> 43:13.640]  lufafa to attack them
[43:14.040 --> 43:18.280]  and that was all staged this is all the this is all public what you're hearing
[43:18.280 --> 43:21.720]  i've literally read 50 60 70 80 i don't know more than that books on nazi
[43:21.720 --> 43:25.000]  germany in the war i mean the big encyclopedia ones
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.400]  so
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.280]  this is how they work this is how they operate this leads us up to today
[43:32.280 --> 43:36.520]  and then hitler they turn against hitler he flips out he starts saying my god
[43:36.520 --> 43:40.280]  they promised me this i wasn't going to technically we're supposed to link up
[43:40.280 --> 43:43.720]  after i've taken europe and then knock out stalin
[43:43.720 --> 43:46.520]  and then we were going to carry out eugenics and exterminate the majority
[43:46.520 --> 43:50.840]  of the non-white population that was the hitler plan if you didn't know
[43:50.840 --> 43:53.640]  how they were going to put fluoride in the water to first pacify people use
[43:53.640 --> 43:56.920]  them as slave labor buy off their leaders how the how the ops were going
[43:56.920 --> 44:00.280]  to work everywhere there was a sick deal with the roth
[44:00.280 --> 44:03.240]  child's you know funding him as well that
[44:03.240 --> 44:06.520]  he would only let jews escape this is main line books are being written by
[44:06.520 --> 44:10.200]  your jewish publications about this uh... that they would only let jews go
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.160]  to palestine that's why they wouldn't let them go to new york or wouldn't let
[44:13.160 --> 44:15.960]  them go to london and they had to pay a million dollars to the zionist to get
[44:15.960 --> 44:20.200]  out so they'd loot them oh yeah
[44:20.200 --> 44:23.080]  paul hartman's out there with his mouth hanging open it's main line i could show
[44:23.080 --> 44:25.320]  your eye have i not always shown you everything i say
[44:25.320 --> 44:28.600]  i could show you right now hartman there's like major university
[44:28.600 --> 44:31.080]  publications coming out with right now everybody's flipping out this is old
[44:31.080 --> 44:34.600]  news so all of
[44:34.600 --> 44:38.360]  all of that went on hitler blows everything up attacks
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.440]  invades the french stand down over eighty to ninety percent of their
[44:42.440 --> 44:45.240]  military stands down the entire leadership were
[44:45.240 --> 44:49.400]  vc french nazis that's why hitler just patrolled came and visited
[44:49.400 --> 44:53.560]  most german forces left to the allies built up left france the vc fascist
[44:53.560 --> 44:56.840]  french ran france those were done in secret
[44:56.840 --> 45:00.280]  deals that had been hooked up also with their former royalty there they were
[45:00.280 --> 45:02.440]  going to talk about bringing back the french royalty
[45:02.440 --> 45:05.080]  that's what the vc wanted and that was supposed to happen in the greater
[45:05.080 --> 45:10.440]  germania and the main global capitals were going to be london
[45:10.440 --> 45:15.480]  paris and berlin with these giant capitals that you could fit like i
[45:15.480 --> 45:22.280]  forget 35 us capital domes in just giant cities they were going to build
[45:22.280 --> 45:25.800]  monorail all this crazy stuff they were going to the stars they were going to
[45:25.800 --> 45:28.600]  build huge space stations hitler you can see
[45:28.600 --> 45:31.480]  film footage again with all these models of space stations and
[45:31.480 --> 45:35.160]  verner von braun running around an albert sphere
[45:35.160 --> 45:40.680]  right oh it's just incredible so i mean they had this big utopian moon raker
[45:40.680 --> 45:44.760]  world they were going to build after i mean i would be exterminated because
[45:44.760 --> 45:50.360]  i've got native american in me only pure nordic germanics will be alive on the
[45:50.360 --> 45:53.720]  planet and then rothschild threw in they made
[45:53.720 --> 45:56.520]  a deal where certain jews are going to be allowed to live i mean that's just a
[45:56.520 --> 45:58.840]  plan
[46:00.520 --> 46:05.640]  so all of this was set up
[46:05.800 --> 46:08.920]  and then hitler starts panicking going you've betrayed me you said we were going
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.000]  to do a deal they fly
[46:13.400 --> 46:16.840]  sometimes i have this this moment who was deputy fur
[46:16.840 --> 46:21.480]  rudolf hess rudolf hess is a fighter pilot from world war one hero
[46:21.480 --> 46:24.760]  he jumps in a fighter bomber flies into london
[46:24.760 --> 46:29.400]  parachutes out over the duke's house lands at the royal
[46:29.400 --> 46:32.280]  one of the royal palaces where the royals are actually yet at that time
[46:32.280 --> 46:35.000]  they were still they were on the radio british tellots come here have a
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.800]  meeting with us they grab him and he's there with all these
[46:37.800 --> 46:41.640]  luciferian ambulance this is mainstream history
[46:41.640 --> 46:44.680]  and he's there going you know you betrayed us what's happening they grab
[46:44.680 --> 46:48.040]  him put him in the tower till he died many years later
[46:48.040 --> 46:52.280]  they moved to london in the tower of london
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.320]  and then hitler says well it doesn't matter if they betrayed us and that's
[46:55.320 --> 46:58.920]  in his speeches on record doesn't matter if they set us up we can't let the
[46:58.920 --> 47:06.920]  communists win launch operation babarosa sneak attack on the russians
[47:06.920 --> 47:11.080]  and so he turns towards the russians and launches that and and and only uses
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.360]  about 10 percent of his force to defend against the invasion of the allies
[47:14.360 --> 47:18.920]  at dunkirk and normandy and the rest of it and he sends in the german forces
[47:18.920 --> 47:22.520]  10 million german troops died in that 20 million russians
[47:22.520 --> 47:25.480]  the most hardcore fighter you can imagine it dwarfs anything
[47:25.480 --> 47:33.880]  ever seen before or seen since just mass carnage and death
[47:33.880 --> 47:37.160]  and so all of that unfolds
[47:38.440 --> 47:42.680]  and they come into europe the globalist banks
[47:42.680 --> 47:45.960]  seize france seize germany they set up nato the
[47:45.960 --> 47:50.040]  they tried to kill de galle in the 60s we tried to throw out nato
[47:50.040 --> 47:52.600]  they wouldn't let the french have their own military de galle had to go out and
[47:52.600 --> 47:56.040]  say it's a takeover i'm not allowing this it was actually people had to be
[47:56.040 --> 47:59.400]  physically thrown out the the british and us forces out of
[47:59.400 --> 48:01.640]  france or the globalists still be there they don't give up a country they've
[48:01.640 --> 48:05.560]  occupied the oecd took over japan took over germany took over all those
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.800]  countries organization of equal economic cooperative
[48:09.800 --> 48:13.720]  development you know it as the marshal plan well that was the private
[48:13.720 --> 48:17.320]  corporation they set up so i'm driving into the
[48:17.320 --> 48:19.560]  office at nine o'clock this morning i'm listening to bbc
[48:19.560 --> 48:24.440]  they've got an oecd on xm an oecd individual
[48:24.440 --> 48:29.320]  from the un on admitting that the big global master banks
[48:29.320 --> 48:33.560]  they're saying this is good are now going to take the money the two trillion
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.560]  out of the swiss bank alone of the low level people
[48:37.560 --> 48:40.760]  there's tens of trillions in there you notice the accounts they've been
[48:40.760 --> 48:45.000]  grabbing on a ubs or like people had a million five million ten million
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.880]  they're just robbing the new vorice right now luxenberg has fallen
[48:49.880 --> 48:53.320]  they're going after the caimans but selectively
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.640]  because the remember the big banks that have these are actually running
[48:57.640 --> 49:00.680]  the regulators so they're just selectively going after
[49:00.680 --> 49:05.560]  ostry is announcing they're gonna turn over anybody the government says
[49:05.560 --> 49:07.880]  going to your calls in a moment i want to just finish up with this
[49:07.880 --> 49:11.880]  swiss bank secrecy pressured as lichtenstein
[49:11.880 --> 49:17.160]  eases bank secrecy rules bloomberg see so now you have this global government
[49:17.160 --> 49:21.000]  where you'll all have cashless you know cards that you buy and sell with in

[49:24.040 --> 49:27.480]  they're now proposing to this is going to be graduated
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.080]  and it's just total world government where you have a cashless id card got a
[49:31.080 --> 49:36.440]  thumb printer face scan to identify and and and as the code key to use it
[49:36.440 --> 49:39.800]  to stop identity theft that's there you know what they claim and this will be
[49:39.800 --> 49:41.880]  total control everything controlled by the bankers
[49:41.880 --> 49:45.880]  this is it total final world domination and that's how slick they are
[49:45.880 --> 49:49.960]  they produced hitler like a movie script like a film
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.160]  went out and went through all the hundreds of little disparate groups and
[49:53.160 --> 49:57.080]  built him up created him set him up had the king come meet with him we're going
[49:57.080 --> 50:00.600]  to do this we need you to do it you have the courage set him up
[50:00.600 --> 50:05.800]  set it all up had the bushes try to take over here and set up martial law
[50:05.800 --> 50:10.040]  but the marines uh the spindly butler they hired the top marine
[50:10.040 --> 50:14.360]  uh brigadier general refuse boy the whistle so
[50:14.360 --> 50:18.200]  very complex things that happened here but
[50:18.200 --> 50:21.800]  they're making another move right now
[50:23.960 --> 50:28.840]  switzerland where banks manage 27 percent of the world's offshore wealth
[50:28.840 --> 50:34.760]  may come under increased pressure to water down bank secrecy at lichtenstein
[50:34.760 --> 50:38.680]  and other countries agree to help in the fight against tax dodgers
[50:38.680 --> 50:41.560]  and whatever the feds want they just get they just dial right into your account
[50:41.560 --> 50:44.360]  lichtenstein said the day will comply with the standards of transparency
[50:44.360 --> 50:47.480]  and information exchange shut by the organization of economic cooperation
[50:47.480 --> 50:50.360]  and development that's your real global government right there
[50:50.360 --> 50:54.200]  and seek agreements with other nations to shed its status

[51:28.920 --> 51:31.160]  which we are currently being prepared to accept

[1:00:39.640 --> 1:00:44.920]  cleared on the day but uh the bomb i think if we can send us to the state supreme court
[1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:49.720]  justice and all the rest of the justice get this out and then when we face them we know
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:53.800]  that they know you understand we've got to shame them and we should have contempt for
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:59.400]  these judges not wanting to hear the cases and i'm telling you people own yourself with newspaper
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:04.840]  clippings of articles these tapes wake your neighbors up because you're gonna need them
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:09.640]  this is the only thing you've got to fight with i mean it explains everything here
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:14.600]  mr jones explains it all you don't have to do nothing but give it out now i know y'all might
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:19.160]  think well oh charlie likes jones he gives out tapes but this is a thing you fight with now
[1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:23.240]  it's just the only thing you've got to fight with right now and if you don't fight with this now
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:27.960]  when the time comes you're gonna be by yourself you're gonna be out there by yourself but if
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:31.720]  people know the truth they'll understand what you're doing i hear you my friend good to hear
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:35.240]  from you charles free bird in georgia free bird you're on the air
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:42.120]  alex yes sir god bless you alex and the work you're doing
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:48.360]  we'll go ahead sir thank you well i'm calling from elena georgia i'm and the main reason i'm
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:55.400]  calling is to um i've already got your obama uh film on order i've got my burner ready i'm ready
[1:01:55.400 --> 1:02:02.200]  to go but the biggest reason i'm calling is about georgia senate resolution 327 i'm trying to get
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:08.840]  the word out to all georgians that reaffirms the ninth and tenth amendment um i've been
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:13.640]  following up on the uh the sovereignty movement and right now there are 33 states that are in
[1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:18.520]  motion with us and if georgians can hear me you need to you need to let your senators know about
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:25.800]  this so we can move on with us absolutely and uh it was narrowly defeated in new hampshire but the
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:30.360]  point is the idea is introduced we've done our duty the people understand the states created the
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:35.720]  feds and many states have passed or are passing remember 14 states previously did it in the 90s
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:41.160]  they just need to enforce it well i'm really excited about this because this is the brand
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:45.080]  of georgia was one of the group that had the old resolution and now they're reaffirming the new
[1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:50.200]  resolution which i think is a statement that the people are energized here and they're they're
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:55.960]  looking for real change not fake change and we may not pass it this time the point is we are
[1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.200]  awakening people we are fighting it's like the first time you try to bench press 300 pounds you
[1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:07.480]  can't do it but over time you get to where you can that's right well that's that's all i'm really
[1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:14.440]  gonna say um i do like the jury read song i'm on fire at my old transient take care buddy
[1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:21.240]  let's talk to nate and main nate you're on the air hello alex good to talk to you to talk to you
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:26.600]  nate um i just wanted to talk about that uh that that new old order letter that you were covering
[1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:33.240]  earlier it sounds a lot like uh read out a project megiddo doesn't it that's right out put out by
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:39.160]  janet renaud to demonize the patriot movement where they say if you talk about the new world order
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:46.840]  or a un takeover or a second coming of christ and then she went on 60 minutes she said if you went
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:51.080]  on if you want 60 minutes instead of you're a christian that believes that jesus is coming back
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:58.440]  you are a dangerous cult member a terrorist al qaeda yep unbelievable absolutely unbelievable
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:05.000]  and uh that your new film the obama deception i got i just gotta say that is that is great for
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:10.680]  both sides people in and outside of this movement because i noticed for people inside this movement
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:16.440]  like me it gives you a lot of good ammo to just go out with the knowledge of look who's look who's
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:23.960]  behind this guy don't look at obama look at who who controls obama yeah it's waking up a lot of
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:28.440]  obama noids right now but other ones won't refuse to watch it and just say racist racist
[1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:32.760]  there's nothing to do with obama's race you know we don't get into the whole kenya thing
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:35.800]  any of that i'm not saying that's not important the point is we don't cover that we cover
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:39.240]  the fact that he's live everything he said he'd do and he's a globalist he's bringing in world

[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:58.040]  for the obama deception be free so i went and bought it um you know it's a great movie um i'm
[1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:04.440]  trying to figure out how i can get people outside our movement to sit down and actually watch this
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:09.960]  and you know i'll just say hey you like obama wow yeah check out some of the people that are in
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:14.920]  this administration and and tell them hey this film exposes bush which it does and just get
[1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:22.120]  them to watch it yeah of course that's the easy one of the screen crucified bush um another thing
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:27.800]  with this uh missouri state police uh watching out for you know people that believe in rompall
[1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:34.120]  uh you think it has anything to do with the fact that the campaign for liberty uh regional conference
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:40.200]  is march 27th through march 29th in st louis missouri at the millennium hotel absolutely but
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:45.080]  you know my dad just popped by the office and he's a professional and the feds are out brainwashing
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:50.280]  and the state police are brainwashing everybody he said at continual uh you know every year denise
[1:09:50.280 --> 1:09:55.240]  have to go back for more training through the state uh and they're all there telling him look out for
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:10:00.280]  gangs he just came in the office during the break to tell me this he said uh and what are gangs
[1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:07.000]  they're sororities and fraternities any group that is secret uh and so they're just saying the entire
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.040]  american people basically are terrorists and so my dad just dropped by to give me that piece of intel
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:18.200]  that's just happened to him in his continual education uh last week so it is just full tilt
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:23.400]  brainwashing basically having a garden talking to your neighbors it's all terrorism just red white
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:28.120]  and blue terrorism any freedom is terrorism second amendment's terrorism george washington's a
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:32.520]  terrorist ron paul's a terrorist alex jones is a terrorist anybody that doesn't want socialism's a
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:36.040]  terrorist anybody that doesn't want to attack other countries as a terrorist anybody who has
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:40.280]  political thoughts as a terrorist and that's what the communists and the nazis and uh poll pot
[1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:46.920]  did that in the cambodia they just killed anybody that wore glasses anybody that had uh fillings
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:51.160]  meant you know that they had enough money that they were educated had to die and i mean it's just
[1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:55.800]  not going to work here they're trying to just have a total shutdown a chilling of free speech so
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:59.720]  everybody's afraid and doesn't talk to their neighbors because through the nsa and everything
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:04.120]  they have computers listening for keywords they know the majority of the american people are now
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:09.320]  talking about the new world order so they're telling police this is evil anybody that talks
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:13.000]  about it is bad and the cops are going what do you mean it's all over the news we're having a
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.400]  world government you mean you're not allowed to talk about it they go that's right it does exist
[1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:20.920]  but it's bad to talk about about it and you're a terrorist that wants to kill cops if you do
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:27.000]  so i mean it's just the most base mindless guilt by association chilling effect demonization
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:32.360]  and it's not going to work i forgot one more thing for you um i live in new jersey and i've been
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:37.800]  pretty much called my congressman letter lance every day telling him that he will be a one-term
[1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:46.280]  congressman if he does not support hr-1207 um you know i think that's very important i understand
[1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:53.560]  our legal systems flawed but this is at least gives us some leeway and gives uh dr paul a chance to
[1:11:53.560 --> 1:12:01.000]  get the truth out um to get rid of the federal reserve but i don't have access to dr paul i
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:08.200]  know you do i know you talk to him very often i listen all the time get this guy to run for president
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:14.120]  with that as consent i mean just tell him out the door just be like look you know we'll have
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:19.080]  enough backing this time three years from now four years from now he will have enough back i think i
[1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:24.120]  think ron paul's probably gonna run for president again man we need him man we need him desperately
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:28.520]  and you know i hear you but we don't want to wait on him we don't he'll tell you don't wait on him
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:33.240]  the state level local level just get the word out so people know who robbed him who the bankers are
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:38.440]  and how it happened i appreciate your call now we're going to go to uh matt and charles and
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:43.400]  brad and ian and others from england and canada and washington and texas and everywhere else
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:46.520]  but i want to go ahead and bring bob Chapman up he'll do this for the rest of the hour until
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:52.840]  chuck norris joins us i think for 20 minutes coming up and to nail that down uh with special
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:59.480]  announcements i've got some interesting questions for him as well but um going to bob Chapman
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:05.400]  bob good to have you here with us the international forecaster dot com well thank you very much and
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:10.680]  here i am again on friday out of the gates i'm sure you've seen it uh what do you think of the
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:16.440]  state police federally written document uh that basically says that anybody that supports the
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:24.440]  second amendment buys gold believes in north american union flies an american flag uh you name it is a
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:32.840]  terrorist it's incomprehensible uh but it's what to be it is what to be expected from the people
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:39.800]  who control our federal government at least and uh it's it's going to go go on and it's going to
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:45.400]  continue to go on and it's going to get worse i think i don't think i know it's backfiring
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:49.880]  though with the police because they've been educated like the general public and they know
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:54.840]  all this is real and then they're being told that the libertarian party ron paul bob bar
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:58.440]  anybody with a bumper sticker they're terrorist i mean that's not going to work
[1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:04.840]  no i think you're right about that and it's a loss in credibility uh by the people who
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:09.800]  are shoving this down their throats and quite frankly it's good for us it's but they're not
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:15.960]  going to give up you know again they've got the police in the middle and anybody who works
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:21.640]  for the government job or under a government contract uh in the bank or brokerage house
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:26.840]  an insurance company they got them all up against the wall they're trying to squeeze them and it is
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:31.400]  not going to work up people will go so far and they'll say no we're not going to do that we're
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:37.240]  not going to do that anymore and they're pushing the police you might say first so to speak
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:40.920]  and i don't think the police are going to rebelling just going to say hey look this is
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:48.040]  ridiculous i'm not going to do that that's wrong absolutely have you had a chance to
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:55.400]  read the state police document yet no i have not well we even called the state police got the names
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:15:01.080]  of the officers uh got them to admit that it's a real document it mirrors many others we've seen
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:07.640]  lieutenant john uh hoates h o t z wouldn't give us his first name the other guy uh was captain
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:15.400]  hull just captain hull uh with the Missouri office of miac and people are still trying to
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:20.840]  deny it's even real even though we put out their names and phone numbers you can call them
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:27.640]  what do you think about that level of denial bob
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:34.680]  i think they're frightened again i think they're frightened more than anything else about their
[1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:40.840]  job again they're in a vice and the federal government's trying to shove something that's
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:47.000]  ridiculous down their throats to be laid upon the public and they like their jobs that they
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:52.840]  pay uh devoted to their careers most of them and some of them are very very fine people
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:59.720]  and uh and they're frightened i don't think they know what to do it's a great intellectual
[1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:05.320]  challenge and you know if they step out and say good goodness gracious we can't do this
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:09.960]  uh the federal government's going to come down on them like a ton of bricks so
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:13.720]  they try to stay in the shadows trying to stay out of harm's way
[1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:21.160]  hey yeah i had one state police officer send me a letter saying that just because he talked
[1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:28.600]  about ron paul and the constitution during the campaign homeland security came in and interviewed
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:34.680]  him to basically ask if he was a terrorist well that's what they can expect from the federal
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:41.640]  government and the people who control it and uh push is going to come to shove i think uh the
[1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:46.680]  sovereign state movement could bring that to a head it's probably one of the most powerful
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:54.440]  things that's happened in years and uh if enough states get behind this thing uh then i think
[1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:59.080]  washington is going to have serious problems well take matt agasker the government was clearly
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:04.120]  oppressing the population so the public rebelled and the government was going through with the
[1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:08.920]  military killing pockets of citizens and then overnight in the last two days the military
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:13.480]  turned against the government and is now marching with the people to overthrow that island nation's
[1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:18.600]  leadership which has been very stable the last few decades so you know they're very just like
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:24.280]  romania which elchescu they're very very worried about their own enforcers waking up and we have
[1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:29.560]  a bunch of bernard made off criminals running the banks openly looting us of nine point seven
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:35.000]  trillion openly collapsing the economy by design the police are figuring that out and the system
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:40.600]  is trying to brainwash them against liberty because criminals run the federal government so
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:45.560]  of course the criminals are going to tell their enforcers that the good people that are trying
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:54.360]  to bring the criminals to justice are bad well i think the um the cover-up on made off uh is
[1:17:55.800 --> 1:18:02.280]  so obvious now they allow him to stay in his apartment and then he uh admits to
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:08.520]  uh uh certain crimes i guess 11 charges and now he's going to go off to prison he'll be sentenced
[1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:14.120]  here shortly and my guess is after he's in there a year or two uh they'll find a reason to let him
[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:22.280]  go uh for for some sort of thing but the most important thing is he and the court and the
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:27.560]  government and wall street are covering up for hundreds of other people who are involved
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:34.440]  and where did all the money go well they're saying one man ran a 50 to 100 billion dollar
[1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:40.280]  Ponzi scheme and they don't know where the money is yeah one guy around sure yeah impossible
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.160]  i'm at you know i was in the brokerage business in wall street for 28 years and that doesn't
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:51.240]  happen and everybody knows what goes on believe me that's a very close business and just like

[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:17.080]  new world order that bankrupts the third world countries all the planet and sucks the cash in
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:28.760]  they're now running around luxenberg switzerland austria and many other countries just terrorizing
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:33.160]  them saying we will selectively tell you who's swiss bank accounts that turn over to us and it's
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:36.840]  all the smaller million five million ten million because we've seen them seize fifty something
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:42.920]  thousand accounts from ubs one of the biggest swiss banks now that sounds big but all the
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:49.640]  big monies left alone more selective enforcement by these guys by these made-offs that run everything
[1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:57.400]  bob Chapman your take on all this well i um i think it's an effort to in time
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:05.320]  whittle down the bank secrecy in all of the countries that have it and uh they uh what they
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:12.840]  also do and i have seen them do first hand in places like uberina the bahamas and caiman's
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:18.520]  they will go to the elected personnel in that country and they will tell them
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:25.560]  and in terms that they understand that uh if you don't do what we want you to do
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:33.320]  we cut off all your communications uh all of your internet uh all your postal facilities
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:39.960]  coming into the country uh your access to banking in the united states which is of course a key point
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:46.520]  and we'll make sure that you don't get any more tourists and uh and we'll pay you x amount of
[1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:51.240]  dollars for doing this and that's exactly what happened in the bahamas because i live there
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:57.480]  and i know i know all the players and i know how it happened and and so that's what they do and
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:06.040]  they they've done that to andorra and lichtenstein in austria and switzerland and lichtenstein uh
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:13.960]  and and and so they want to put them out of business they want people to be able they want to be able
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:22.440]  to access the uh the uh assets of every person in the world and the reason why is that they think
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:31.800]  it belongs to them this is the so sociopathic mindset mindset and they will continue to pursue
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:39.400]  that until we win or uh they get destroyed and uh if you put all these other things together that
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:43.800]  are going on that we just discussed about uh the police and everybody being terrorists
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:49.480]  it isn't going to work and you've said that yourself and i believe that i think we're going
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:57.480]  to win and when big uh it might be very painful uh it'll be very interesting to see what switzerland
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:04.120]  does next now what the u.s. government has been doing secretly and this will come out later uh is
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:12.200]  that the treasury has been selling treasury paper bonds bills notes to the federal reserve the federal
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:18.520]  reserve makes money out of thin air and pays the treasury immediately monetizing the money
[1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:24.520]  making it inflationary as the u.s. government puts it into the market for or into the economy
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:31.720]  at the same time the fed takes the bonds and either lends them out or sells them into the
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:37.880]  market monetizing them which is very inflationary now what the swiss have done in the last couple
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:45.400]  of days has started to do the same thing that the u.s. government has been doing and i think
[1:27:45.400 --> 1:27:51.160]  that all of the nations are going to do that in fact what the swiss did is they went in and they
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:59.800]  bought corporate bonds out of the market and that's highly unusual and the swiss are trying to keep
[1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:07.480]  their currency on an evil even level so to speak with the euro so that they won't have a competitive
[1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:12.760]  disadvantage if the euro continues to go lower because the swiss frank was not going lower
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:19.560]  it's one of the stronger currencies in the world and so they were trying to keep it at that level
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:30.280]  and in the last couple of days the swiss frank has gone down in value a bit and but i think that
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:35.960]  will be rectified because the swiss still have plenty of gold and if they want to use it they
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:43.240]  can't back their currency if they choose to do that again and so this is the kind of ball
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:49.960]  that the united states has been playing for years i mean we just didn't know it you know back in the
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:57.160]  1920s and 30s and 40s the communications weren't there and even through the 50 60s and 70s only
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:04.360]  a handful of us knew what was going on and today lots of people do and that's because of you alex
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:09.960]  and other shows like this that are going all over the world and telling people the truth and people
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:16.840]  are acting on this stuff everywhere believe me governments all over the world are having problems
[1:29:16.840 --> 1:29:21.560]  because of the information that we're putting out a lot of globalist governments are falling
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:25.960]  right now as people figure out that everything's the global government is a bunch of banks they
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:31.400]  want to bring in a world cashless society so they can control everything interest rates taxes nobody
[1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:36.200]  can run face scanning to travel anywhere this is their program this is their plan let's talk more

[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:38.040]  calls here they'll be all over the map but that's fine bob your big boy can talk about all subjects
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:43.880]  very informed um you know you predicted a few weeks ago a month or so ago the goal would run back up
[1:36:43.880 --> 1:36:47.880]  to a thousand you should probably drop a little again but then start racing back up and i believe
[1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:53.640]  from memory you said that then you think it's basically to the moon from there uh and you also
[1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:56.920]  said you thought there'd be several more bounces in the stock market it would finally go down to
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:02.120]  about four thousand it's gone down to the six thousands now up to seven thousand again uh
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:09.960]  revise extend your remarks any other comments on that bob Chapman well we just uh in the stock
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:20.680]  market and the dow gone from a shade under uh 6600 uh back up to the 7100 area and that's not
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:26.920]  unusual uh markets don't go straight down or straight up for that matter and so they kind
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:36.440]  of bob and weave through and the market today uh is trying to test 7264 and uh it's about uh
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:43.720]  uh oh probably 70 or 80 points away from that now it'll probably reach it today and today or next
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:49.880]  week and i believe it'll fail to go higher at this time uh there's just too many negative
[1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:57.240]  things out there on a fundamental basis and i think it will go back down and test that 6600
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:38:02.920]  area approximately and that's normal as well and you know you have a lot of professionals
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:09.960]  trading in the market and they trade all day every day and and uh they make markets move
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:16.120]  government makes market markets move as well and uh i think i think that the government has lost
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:24.680]  control of the stock market their their influence on uh making uh any uh intermediate term uh impact
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:32.440]  um they can come in if the market's going down and hold it up for a while uh perhaps a day or two
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:38.280]  but that's about it and so we're headed back down to 1066 i think before the end of the year
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:45.480]  we'll be down to 5500 maybe even 5000 uh we could conceivably be lower because uh
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:53.640]  the scandals and the uh the lies and the condition of the economy and unemployment just
[1:38:53.640 --> 1:38:58.760]  continue to deteriorate and they're not going to get any better and uh we hear people from
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:06.680]  banking institutions and wall street saying well if everybody does it what they're supposed to do
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:12.200]  uh jay me diamond and jp morgan uh chase things to think that things will be okay by the end of
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:17.720]  the year and this is the same guy who told us just a little over a year ago that all our problems
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:22.120]  would be over by june and of course he was wrong and they're all wrong and they know they're going
[1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:28.920]  to be wrong but they got a lie and that's part of this game and so the market is going lower
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:34.520]  bob will be seven you're in the market except for golden silver shares get out if you've got a
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:40.920]  new reason cash values of a policy the value of your of your holdings are going to go down
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:47.160]  if you're in pension funds uh the value of your pension fund is going to drop and there's no two
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:53.080]  ways about it and there's no good no way to get around it the 787 million dollar federalization
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:58.680]  package known as stimulus package uh some are saying a lot of mainline economists are saying
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:02.920]  that they think it'll do a boost for six months a year but then things will just continue to plunge
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:06.440]  and that's only for the markets will it make them go up a little bit but then in the real economy
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:11.000]  things are still shutting down at an even accelerated pace and all the numbers on housing
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:17.240]  starts and and and retail and homes that are upside down show that uh do you agree that this
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:22.040]  may boost things for a while or from what you're saying you're saying it won't well on the short
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:28.280]  term no because they laid most of the money into next year uh being politicians that they are and
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:36.280]  in office they want to get reelected so the thrust of what's going to happen in the economy
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:42.520]  from the stimulus package will be felt next year so we can assume that there's a good chance
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:49.080]  that the Dow could sell down to say five thousand this year it's possible maybe even four thousand
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:53.720]  and and i've said before i think if we stop at four thousand we're going to be lucky
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:41:00.600]  uh we could have somewhat of a minor renaissance next year that might last for six months and
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:06.760]  and let's say that the dow was at four thousand it might rally back up to fifty five hundred or six
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:09.640]  thousand because that's what walls day there that's what wall street likes like to run it up and down
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:15.160]  up and down to consolidate wealth well and they all want to make money that's all that's all we
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:22.520]  think about let me uh change would go ahead and of course with gold uh this is the fourth time
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:30.680]  it's tested nine hundred again it's selling around nine thirty today uh the same tremendous shortage of
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:37.560]  gold and silver coins and bullion exist worldwide uh it seems that the awful lot of people are out
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:41.960]  there buying what they can get their hands on uh the u.s. mint says again that they don't have
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:46.760]  blanks to make the gold coins and that they're never uh probably never again going to make
[1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:53.720]  uh the smaller denomination coins of a tenth or a quarter or half an ounce and uh and so the
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:59.240]  shortages are still there yet but the gold seems to be languishing between nine hundred and a
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:04.600]  thousand that's not going to last forever well that was my up at your only insurance policy that
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:11.640]  was my next point is that having the new vorice uh swiss bank accounts and other secret accounts
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:16.680]  robbed worldwide it's become very retail where the elite only did this in the past but now people
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:20.360]  that aren't even making a million bucks a year or five hundred thousand dollars a year have been
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:25.160]  putting a lot of money even after taxes just because they didn't trust our banks overseas now
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:29.480]  it's being rated i've even seen reports that that is going to put more pressure on these people to
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:34.840]  go into the true safe haven physically held gold and silver so it looks like having two trillion
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:40.920]  as the bbc is reported being now diverted quickly out of switzerland alone i would imagine that's
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:49.400]  going to drop up gold without question because the the best currency in the world is a swiss franc
[1:42:49.400 --> 1:42:54.600]  and if people are going to be pulling money out of the swiss franc or out of swiss banks
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:43:01.000]  which is legitimately there that's going to create a problem that there's no place else for them to
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  go except for gold and you've been seeing this for 10 months in the physical part of the market
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:13.560]  and it's going to continue and of course this business with the us not printing coins or
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:21.720]  minting coins uh is boulder dash uh look they don't want gold in the public's hands this is this is
[1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:29.560]  what that's all about because gold is real money and for those called they're terrorist enemies
[1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:37.640]  who are buying these coins and bars worldwide of the very people the worst possible people
[1:43:37.640 --> 1:43:41.640]  who could have this in their hands as far as the alumnus are concerned
[1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:48.920]  well i heartily agree with you on on that bob chairman i want to take a few calls before we
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:56.840]  do that this is just in i said back on what was the mass shootings tuesday uh in alabama
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:03.080]  and in germany i said guaranteed because it's 99 of the cases we said that we're not just saying
[1:44:03.080 --> 1:44:08.280]  that they're on psychotropic drugs and in special psychiatric care normally at military bases are
[1:44:08.280 --> 1:44:12.040]  tied into the government turns out the guy in alabama was tied into some military program was
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:17.320]  in a quote police training program and was in some type of psychiatric care now it's been
[1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:22.760]  confirmed by the associated press psychiatric drug use of german shooter confirmed and it says
[1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:32.280]  uh crest schumer withdrawn from depression treatment and this is from the ap associated
[1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:38.920]  press police investigator seek freed mauler states on the record that the shooter underwent
[1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:44.040]  severe treatment sessions for depression in the psychiatric clinic and was prescribed a session
[1:44:44.040 --> 1:44:48.840]  of outpatient therapy which he never began thus the shooter was in psychotropic medications
[1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:54.120]  and then quit using them which causes the total psycho behavior you gotta go off this over several
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:59.000]  months folks according to the doctors the create this created a classic antidepressant withdrawal
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:03.880]  crisis which is exactly what leads to extreme acts of violence against the cell for others
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:12.440]  so uh we were right about that again bob chairman you sure were unfortunately and this is going to
[1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:19.000]  continue and that's the way they set these things up and uh and screen gun control gun control
[1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:26.280]  and uh you see the stuff that's coming down the pike and uh and what they want to enact and uh
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:33.560]  we're gonna have to fight them every uh step of the way uh especially uh oh and oh i forgot i'm
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:39.480]  sorry go ahead no no go ahead no no i just forget all these times i just forget all these top stories

[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:15.400]  and now they're announcing because of mexico collapsing they've got to restrict our guns

[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:20.280]  i mean it's so simple and the establishment knows this
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:25.400]  my head is just spinning here let's talk to laura in montana you're on the air with bob
[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:32.120]  shabbin international forecaster dot com thanks for having me on i'm a first-time caller i uh
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:37.800]  have a question actually two questions i hope you can answer bob i'm coming about the mark to
[1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:45.560]  market rule as i understand it is essentially marking assets or even derivatives on the book
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:52.840]  to the current market value and i heard it came into being last year i'm wondering if that's true
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:48:00.520]  uh and i'm just thinking are they wanting this gone so that if their book value is higher even
[1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:08.600]  though it's phony it means the stocks will go up well your synopsis and your facts are all correct
[1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:17.560]  and mark to market has been used for a couple hundred years uh in in the stock market and
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:27.000]  in corporations and uh about a year and a half ago um the treasury department and the sec told
[1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:38.120]  companies to uh a value at a reasonable price illiquid investments because if there was no market
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:46.680]  the companies had to guess at what they were worth and that has led to a false financial
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:54.360]  impression of what the assets are really worth if you've got a collateralized debt obligation bond
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:49:03.880]  which is full of mortgages and it was sold as triple a and it really now is like triple b minus
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:11.480]  and though the the mortgages which might be parts of thousands of mortgages within that bond
[1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:19.640]  a really worth 15 cents in the dollar what's happening is the owners of those bonds corporations
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:28.440]  pension funds whatever they're marking them to a guess at the market which might be 80 or 75 or
[1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:37.480]  65 70 percent when in fact they're worth much less now the treasury department uh the united
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:44.360]  states government the sec doesn't want them to discontinue doing that they don't want it marked
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:51.560]  to the real value in the market because that would be 15 cents maybe and so what we have here
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:59.560]  is phony bookkeeping the whole thing is insanity it's i always call it mickey mouse bookkeeping
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:08.840]  and that's what they're trying to do subdivision american public to make them think that many
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:14.520]  companies that hold this toxic waste are really more than what worth more than what they are
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:20.280]  and that everything's going to be okay and yes it would tend to make their stocks go higher
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:27.880]  well okay i don't okay i don't understand them if if the mark to market rule is is it marking
[1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:36.840]  uh a security or a derivative to the uh real value of what the market is is giving it right now
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:42.840]  and they want to keep that rule or they want to get rid of that rule you know and also they want
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:48.360]  to get rid of the rule because the rule exists and the government's things go around them

[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:42.920]  uh hi alex how you doing good ian um right um there was one thing relating to the finance
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:48.680]  of these issues i'd love to hear what is um his opinion is regarding um hymer kybler
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:53.800]  uh when he was uh the whistleblower out of lechgenstein
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:55:01.640]  well that's an interesting situation it had never happened before and i really don't know
[1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:09.000]  the details but i do know that a deal was made with um the german authorities will call them
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:13.720]  that's right uh with this individual and he was paid a substantial amount of money
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:20.440]  to turn over accounts that were being and the british and the french yes
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:24.120]  to other to to the authorities
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:31.720]  yeah that's right i was i was wondering if you had any more insights into the specifics
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:37.320]  about the you know the uh the issues which are directly related to that
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:47.160]  uh no i do not um if i lived in europe perhaps i would but i don't um and uh we we got very little
[1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:54.440]  information uh outside on that only what i could read in publications like the frankfurt algomine
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:56:01.240]  and attributation if and um and well there's people did a major piece on it did you not see
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:09.720]  that one yeah i did i did see that yes so i mean uh clearly that you know it's being outed about the
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:16.920]  the way in which the uh the different monies are being hidden um in order to satisfy different
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:22.680]  organizations who do i mean it it's all about secrecy isn't it they have to maintain the swiss
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:28.840]  even the swiss wouldn't maintain that kind of level of secrecy and so they have to go into lechgenstein
[1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:36.840]  in order to achieve that uh at the end of the day required you know alex pointed out something
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:43.320]  earlier in the program and that was a selective release of information and i think that's what
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:49.480]  you got in listenstein and i think that's what the us is looking for in switzerland now that's
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:53.880]  what they've said they're gonna do they're gonna leave the big boys alone that's right and so the
[1:56:53.880 --> 1:57:00.120]  the lower level uh will be unaffected and so that means the politicians and the big hitters
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:05.400]  will still be able to hide their money but that's the point about what kiba did because he took
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:11.000]  the information and he had all the information about that the big hitters and he exposed it for
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:16.360]  for what it was and also not only that but the methodologies being applied by the ruling class
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:24.360]  the the royalty and that the royalty we utilizing the uh you know the absolute power that they had
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:31.640]  in order to secure secrecy around these accounts and and it's interesting that that part of the
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:37.640]  information never saw the light of day at least i never saw it well it has come out i mean that
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:47.400]  was part of the disfigure uh you mean it listed the bigwigs they're yeah they uh they announced
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:55.240]  a number of people um specifically um large investors one of them was a big austrian
[1:57:55.240 --> 1:57:59.800]  politician too right that's right that they exposed an awful lot of individuals but they
[1:57:59.800 --> 1:58:04.040]  also exposed the organizations but of course the organizations hide the individuals too
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:10.360]  but they did expose a number of individuals um uh especially in the uk weirdly enough
[1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:15.880]  interesting we're out of time i appreciate your call from the uk and bob chatman always great

[2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:46.440]  come back on until i heard this big announcement that he's going to be making a big announcement
[2:00:46.440 --> 2:00:51.880]  today in a national simulcast on the radio and on the web and i wanted to get him on about that
[2:00:51.880 --> 2:00:57.560]  and a host of issues talk of him being running for president of texas or president of the us and
[2:00:57.560 --> 2:01:04.440]  headlines all over the world news here you know here's one out of the british press where they're
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:09.480]  talking about you know chuck norris says that there are secret right wing cells around the
[2:01:09.480 --> 2:01:14.680]  country who aren't going to go along with obama socialism so very very interesting chuck norris
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:19.960]  thank you for coming on oh you bet alex i don't know about that i don't remember writing anything
[2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:26.840]  about right wing sales in america but here's the examiner chuck norris claims thousands of right
[2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:31.320]  wing cells groups exist and will rebel against us government so that's what they got i guess from
[2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:36.040]  your world that daily story what did you really say oh no no the thing is you know that basically
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:40.360]  what i've told you last year is that you know we just got to get our country back on the right
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:45.560]  track again and and you know basically what i'm saying was about today you know what's glenn
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:52.040]  back who was uh putting this that we surround them concept together and uh you know and nothing
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:57.160]  about right wing sales you know i mean that we're not terrorist you know for crying out loud but uh
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:01.800]  the thing is is that i you know like i said last year alex is that uh we have just got
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:07.400]  to get our country going back like our founding fathers had the vision for us as america you
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:15.160]  know and and staying with our traditional values yeah i think they spun it from uh your quote here
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:19.480]  where you said how much more will americans take women will enough be enough and when that time
[2:02:19.480 --> 2:02:25.720]  comes will our leaders finally listen or will history need to have a second american revolution
[2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:29.640]  will we the people have the authority according to the americans declaration of independence
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:35.320]  which states so i i don't know how they spun it into that i i think they spun it because you said
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:40.440]  we're going to have folks all over the country on this friday uh the 13th i'm lucky for the elite
[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:46.920]  so tell us what's coming up today oh today glenn back he started the uh you know a thing called
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:53.960]  do we surround them which uh means uh the nine principles that we know that uh we america should
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:58.520]  live by america is good i believe in god and he is the center of my life i must always be more
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:03.480]  honest uh me a much more honest person than i was yesterday you know things of that sort there and
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:10.040]  then the 12 values of honesty reverence hope drift so forth and so on and uh so really what glenn
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:15.080]  back is trying is trying to say today is that the people have got to go back to the values that we
[2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:20.840]  had for many many years and we're drifting off of that and uh and i totally agree with him
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:25.800]  you know the thing is i just don't believe government should plan provide for and rule our
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:31.960]  lives like rewards of the state you know uh taxation is what drove us uh our founders away
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:38.040]  from out of england to come to uh america in the first place is because they're being overtaxed
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:44.040]  in england and now we're going right back to the same concept that happened hundreds of years ago
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:50.360]  back in uh back in england and and uh you know the thing is alex we've got to get off this train
[2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:54.920]  you know we've got to get off this train here we're being taxed to death in this country and
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:59.560]  i think everyone all your listeners will agree with me you know with the income taxes the employment
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:05.000]  taxes capital gains estate corporate property social security you know this is not a liberal
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:09.960]  is an issue or a conservative issue it's an american issue because everyone is suffering
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:14.840]  whether you're uh liberal or you're a conservative everyone is suffering in our country today
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:21.320]  and we have to figure out a solution to overcome to me you know it you know the thing is alex
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:26.200]  it's not bothering me you know i'm basically halfway retired you know i i've made i've been
[2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:32.280]  very blessed to have made the money that i've made to be able to live a comfortable life
[2:04:32.280 --> 2:04:38.440]  but i'm concerned about the young people in america who are are looking to the future and
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:43.240]  and the thing is the future looks very bleak right now and we've got to figure out a solution
[2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:48.040]  you know to this bleakness and i think that that's why i really believe in a fair tax alex
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:52.120]  i think i talked to you about it last uh last year sure let's talk more about that in your new
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:57.960]  book black belt patriotism we get back with glenn back stay with tonight on glenn back he's doing

[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:38.920]  and thousands of groups around the country will be meeting in solidarity over their concerns for
[2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:44.680]  our nation uh is the quote here from our guests and i have a host of questions i wanted to ask
[2:08:44.680 --> 2:08:50.440]  him but last time he was on we didn't get into his nationwide group kickstart.com and we didn't
[2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:54.600]  spend a lot of time on black belt patriotism either so uh chuck norris please get into that
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:58.760]  first for us this is important information and i read the book and i just agree with everything in
[2:08:58.760 --> 2:09:05.320]  it well first of all you talk about kickstart kickstart's a program where i teach the martial arts
[2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:11.400]  in the inner city middle schools i started this uh 16 years ago with the support of former president
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:16.840]  bush and uh the thing is being a martial art teacher 15 years before i got into the film world
[2:09:16.840 --> 2:09:22.360]  i i taught thousands of young kids and i've helped i was able to help them overcome a lot of
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:28.600]  insecurities that they had whether it's emotional uh physical or uh psychological insecurities
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:33.800]  and i thought well this is great but what about the millions of young kids in america whose families
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:38.360]  don't have the money to bring them to a commercial school like my school how could we reach these
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:43.800]  youngsters and that was and that's why i why i started kickstart is to implement it into the
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:50.120]  public schools as part of their pe program and so that's what i've done i've got 43 schools in the
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:56.440]  state of texas middle schools uh and there were 150 kids in each school so we have about 6,000 kids
[2:09:56.440 --> 2:10:03.240]  in the program 60,000 kids have graduated from this program alex many of them going on to college
[2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:07.080]  and becoming successful on their own right and they would tell you if they were talking to you
[2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:12.280]  right now alex they would say if it wasn't for this kickstart program they would either probably
[2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:18.120]  be in prison or dead today so the thing is is that that's what my mission in life is is to
[2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:23.640]  reach as many young people and help get them on the right right track of life as i possibly can
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:30.040]  and and so kickstart is the means of building strong moral character in our youth through the
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:35.400]  martial arts because isn't most of martial arts i mean it's a mental thing and it's about control
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:39.880]  and and being honorable isn't it and this teaches them something they don't get from tv yeah the
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:45.000]  thing is it turned my life around i was pretty much an at-risk child you know growing up with
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:50.040]  you know with just a mom and and all the insecurities that i had because i didn't have a
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:55.400]  male role model to help me again get on the right path of life so i grew up very insecure
[2:10:55.400 --> 2:11:00.760]  and very shy and and very non-athletic all people kind of laugh at that but it's true
[2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:05.000]  and the martial arts really turned my whole life around it it gave me that inner strength
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:10.280]  that i needed and that and an opposite strength to be able to pursue the goals that i've accomplished
[2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:15.480]  today truthfully uh if it hadn't been for the martial arts uh i don't know where i would be
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:20.440]  today because uh i wouldn't gotten that strength to overcome the obstacles that i had to face
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:25.960]  throughout my life and you condense a lot of what you've learned throughout life health
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:29.720]  patriotism bill of rights constitution you know i published a book called the scent in the tyranny
[2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:34.920]  in 2002 and i ended it with the bill of rights and constitution and and and i just love seeing
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:39.800]  that that's how your book ended uh because i mean i guess you know our brains think alike that's
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:44.120]  what people need to get back to or i tell you that's true alex you know the thing is that's why
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:51.080]  i put it in there a lot of people don't know what's in the the constitution or the uh the bill of
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:56.760]  rights or the declaration of independence and and they really need to show up on what is going on
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:12:01.720]  and i like to get back to this uh fair tax cost just for a moment because what most people don't
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:06.520]  realize is that we have over three million manufacturing jobs being outsourced to other
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:11.080]  countries and why are they being outsourced because the taxes are draining them and they
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:16.200]  can't make it go make a goal of it here in america with the taxation system we have
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:21.800]  and there's over 17 trillion dollars being hidden in offshore accounts by the super
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:27.400]  rich probably more now because of what's going on but the thing is that we had a fair tax alex
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:33.240]  we get all that money could come back into our economy and give our economy a huge boost what
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:38.120]  type of uh production jobs could come back what type of fair tax do you like uh check my assumption
[2:12:38.120 --> 2:12:42.440]  tax you know i i believe a you know if you can afford to buy something you buy it if you can't
[2:12:42.440 --> 2:12:48.600]  afford it you wait till you have the money sales tax a sales tax uh consumption tax yeah yeah i
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:54.120]  would be for that sir but i saw you in documents a decade ago the problem is what they're going to
[2:12:54.120 --> 2:12:57.640]  do is and i do support one they're not going to really get rid of the income tax they're going
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:02.360]  to try to call it your social security tax and claim it's only 10 and jack it up and try to
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:07.000]  run them all at the same time i i mean i do agree that that's a constitutional tax and the income
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:12.920]  taxes is is a not constitutional can you speak to the income tax a half a million pages nobody
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:20.120]  can follow it should that be abolished 66298 pages alex i mean who in the world knows what's in
[2:13:20.120 --> 2:13:25.960]  that trolley wrangle doesn't know you know and i mean now uh tom geithner i mean look at all look
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:32.040]  at the people that are in government today who are basically tax evaders they think uh the government
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:38.200]  says they made mistakes but if we do it we're tax evaders you know we go to jail but the thing is
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:44.600]  is that uh you know uh the irs well it was only became constitutional in 1913 a lot of people
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:52.120]  don't realize this that the irs was unconstitutional until 1913 when the government uh when the
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:58.760]  congress made a uh an amendment constitutional amendment the 16th amendment to make it constitutional
[2:13:58.760 --> 2:14:04.040]  and uh and we've been going downhill ever since that time well yeah the private fellow reserve
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:08.040]  controls that i'm sure you've noticed you write your tax checks to the private fellow reserve
[2:14:08.040 --> 2:14:12.760]  that's never been audited ron paul's introduced a bill to audit the federal reserve do you agree
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:18.600]  with that oh absolutely absolutely you know there's a you know the iris is a gestapo you know
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:24.520]  you're guilty until proven innocent that's only people one where you're guilty until proven innocent
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:29.720]  rather than innocent until proven guilty and that and that's not fair that's not that's not right
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:35.720]  here in our country and we're we're we're we're a country of freedom and we and we need to do that
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:43.320]  and uh i just i'm so upset that's why i'm such a supporter of glenn beck i really could consider
[2:14:43.320 --> 2:14:49.640]  him like you like i really consider you a crusader and i consider uh glenn beckett crusader of what
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:55.240]  we need to do because the whole thing is we're going to lose our constitution well patrick henry
[2:14:55.240 --> 2:14:59.000]  said the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it's an
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.400]  instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and i believe
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:08.360]  that's what's happening to us today yeah it's been to buy down uh buy down the out of control
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:13.000]  behavior of dominant men um i've got a list of just quick questions here that i want to make
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:17.800]  sure i get out while we have check notice uh live with us on this friday the 13th i'm lucky for the
[2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:23.400]  elite lucky for us and let me just say i like a lot of things glenn beck has to say and the
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:27.880]  things he does some of his foreign policy i i don't agree with him and you know he early on
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:34.440]  really kind of criticized ron paul now he's embraced him so i hope that that continues uh i mean ron
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:38.680]  paul is such a champion of liberty well you know that you have it i have a saying i don't know if
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:43.320]  i told you anyway uh you know all these chug north facts that are floating around for three years
[2:15:43.320 --> 2:15:50.120]  anyway one one of them is that america's not a democracy it's a it's a chuck petership and i
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:55.960]  said now that was true if that was true i would go to washington to congress i lined up all the
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:16:01.800]  members of congress and i'd have ron paul who i believe is the most honest member of congress
[2:16:01.800 --> 2:16:08.120]  and i'd say ron point out the honest and the dishonest politicians and as we're walking down
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:14.680]  the row uh ron would say well he's honest he's honest uh he's he's dishonest and i walk up to him
[2:16:14.680 --> 2:16:19.800]  and i'd say you're fired and if he didn't move immediately i took him unconscious and dragged
[2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:24.840]  him over to the pile so what i wouldn't do that to is the women nancy polosi i'd walk up and say
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:31.640]  nancy you're fired but you have all the time all the time in the world to leave uh chuck norris
[2:16:31.640 --> 2:16:36.680]  is amazing to have you on air with us i want to get into what's coming up today with this nationwide
[2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:40.520]  simulcast i've seen reports of a big announcement are you gonna announce you're gonna try to
[2:16:40.520 --> 2:16:45.400]  run for governor of texas uh in 2010 or are you gonna announce you're gonna run for president
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:50.120]  i did a little tongue-in-cheek article you know when i wrote about uh if things don't improve in
[2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:55.400]  our country then maybe texas should succeed from the union now it's tongue-in-cheek you know and
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:17:00.680]  i said now if we succeed from the union i will run for the president of texas well you know not
[2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:06.680]  talking about not talking about secession uh but but the states created the first 13 and we have the
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:11.720]  right to revolt article 10 in the new hampshire and texas you know treated in because we are a
[2:17:11.720 --> 2:17:17.800]  republic texas is the republic so exactly we created the federal government the states did
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:22.440]  and the media spun this is secession these 30 plus states are moving to redeclare ninth and
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:26.520]  tenth amendment with all these unfunded mandates and federal control what do you say to that
[2:17:26.520 --> 2:17:32.440]  oh i don't know you know i'm not really i i i'm not up on that alec so i i can't really give
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:36.920]  a an honest but i mean states declaring their sovereignty not succeeding just saying we're
[2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:41.240]  not going to let the federal government boss us around oh is that well i well i hope they do that
[2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:45.800]  the thing is that's what the states have got to do they've got to get their good get controlled back
[2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:50.600]  of the their people of that particular state and and if that's what they're saying i'm totally in
[2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:56.920]  support of all that we got we got to pull the power away from government and uh you know because
[2:17:56.920 --> 2:18:01.800]  the thing is you know it john adams our second president stated that our constitution was made
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:07.320]  only for a religious and moral people and i really believe that alec and it's wholly inadequate for
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:12.520]  the government of any other and the thing is that we don't just maintain our faith and our moral
[2:18:12.520 --> 2:18:19.000]  values you know and then the the the constitution is going to wind up dissolving now right in front
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:22.440]  of our eyes chuck i don't blame you about knowing about the state sovereignty movement because it
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:26.440]  just started a few weeks ago but you're very influential when it comes to conservatives
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:31.960]  and libertarians and freedom lovers so uh check into that because it's it's it's really building
[2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:37.800]  um some of the other questions i have for you specifically what are you going to be covering
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:42.840]  on this national simulcast tonight uh well at you know it's uh at four o'clock you know is there
[2:18:42.840 --> 2:18:46.680]  raining in austin yes it is raining in austin yeah well it's raining here at the ranch too
[2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:52.600]  right but the thing is uh you know i i just encourage all your listeners to tune in to alex
[2:18:52.600 --> 2:18:59.160]  to glenn beck today uh at four o'clock uh central time and and and glenn will really
[2:18:59.160 --> 2:19:03.640]  fill them in he can do it a lot better than i can on what he what course of action that he
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:08.920]  believes we should take in our country and uh i believe that people really uh should listen to
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:15.560]  glenn today to find out exactly what uh what he feels and how millions of us in america
[2:19:15.560 --> 2:19:21.960]  who are gathering together today to support uh the values that uh glenn is going to emphasize
[2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:26.840]  on today well i agree with the ten pledges up there and you know the ideas there maybe we
[2:19:26.840 --> 2:19:32.520]  should go over some of those um well you know the good yeah because the thing is you know
[2:19:32.520 --> 2:19:37.640]  like uh like glenn says that you know uh the government works for me i do not answer to them
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:43.000]  they answer to me all i see that's exactly right you know i i truly believe that too
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:48.440]  the government works for us you know in fact i had a i wrote an article saying that you know
[2:19:48.440 --> 2:19:54.600]  president obama you work for me we don't work for you but uh the thing is it's true though
[2:19:54.600 --> 2:19:59.800]  i mean seriously uh the government should be thinking about the best interest of the citizens
[2:19:59.800 --> 2:20:05.400]  of america we the people rather than thinking of the best interest for them and there's so much
[2:20:05.400 --> 2:20:13.480]  corruption going on in congress i would i would love to see an audit of every member of congress
[2:20:14.120 --> 2:20:18.760]  well because the only ones that we've audited so far are the ones that have come forward like
[2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:23.960]  you know like geithner and dash on it and every every one of them have been been picked for a
[2:20:23.960 --> 2:20:28.840]  position in government have come up dirty well chuck norris that was my next question
[2:20:28.840 --> 2:20:34.680]  perfect timing there uh obama appointing on leave of her fbi raid at their office and arrest
[2:20:34.680 --> 2:20:38.600]  most of them in like 90 percent it's more than that of people he tries to appoint
[2:20:38.600 --> 2:20:44.040]  don't pay taxes are tied in with payoffs are tied in with corruption exactly and i've never seen
[2:20:44.040 --> 2:20:49.720]  so i mean this is chicago big machine uh stuff i mean this is getting this is getting scary and
[2:20:49.720 --> 2:20:54.440]  then you see this scary we see these reports because the thing is you know they have become
[2:20:54.440 --> 2:20:59.640]  so blatant and you know that they they're not afraid you know it's like this one uh kid go
[2:20:59.640 --> 2:21:04.520]  went up to uh to uh charles wrangle you know i don't know you saw that or not but anyway yes
[2:21:04.520 --> 2:21:09.960]  some young man was videotaping him talking to wrangle and said uh what i missed uh congressman
[2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:15.000]  wrangle why are we paying for your catalogue eight hundred dollars a month for your catalogue
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:20.600]  why don't you pay for it for yourself and he said it's none of your gd business yeah why does
[2:21:20.600 --> 2:21:26.840]  nancy polosi but he says none of your gd business you know very arrogant well dancy polosi very
[2:21:26.840 --> 2:21:32.040]  arrogant alex and uh because they don't think we we the people can do anything about what

[2:21:37.800 --> 2:21:44.120]  we can do well chuck norris i know you're a very focused centered uh gentlemanly person but laying
[2:21:44.120 --> 2:21:47.960]  it out reading your article in world net daily and others and listening to you on other radio
[2:21:47.960 --> 2:21:52.520]  shows and things you've said you're talking about will the american people stand up or will there be
[2:21:52.520 --> 2:21:59.080]  a revolution uh if this is an information revolution that's happening but i have the government
[2:21:59.080 --> 2:22:04.360]  documents i have the secret state police reports that the feds give them where they say bob bar
[2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:09.480]  ron paul chuck baldwin libertarians people with these stickers are dangerous they're bad they want
[2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:15.720]  to kill them who said that uh this is what the feds uh this just went out this month so clearly
[2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:20.280]  it's coming from the obama people uh it's up on info wars dot com i've talked to the state police
[2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:24.760]  they admit this was given to them by the feds issue to their state police officers saying people
[2:22:24.760 --> 2:22:29.800]  that own gold are bad it's up on screen right now it's the uh and it's called the modern militia
[2:22:29.800 --> 2:22:36.440]  movement but then it it demonizes mainline the libertarians and everybody and says watch out
[2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:40.920]  for them they're dangerous i mean it seems like people in the federal government right now realize
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:46.440]  the threat to them is people that are talking like you uh chuck morris yeah i know well the other
[2:22:46.440 --> 2:22:52.520]  thing is the libertarians i'm i'm you know i uh a lot of my friends are libertarians and and i've
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:58.040]  even considered at the times you know because you know the republicans are getting so far uh out
[2:22:58.040 --> 2:23:03.240]  there too i mean 40 of the republicans voted for the stupid stimulus package you know and
[2:23:03.240 --> 2:23:08.520]  that really frustrated me you know that uh they realized but the thing is there's the corruption
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:12.440]  there's the greed right there alex and well that was my next question this is perfect you
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:16.920]  keep bringing up the same point i was about to get to joe i mean look look i i cut my teeth as a
[2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:21.320]  conservative i'm pro-second amendment i'm i'm i'm a you know constitutionalist paleo conservative
[2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:26.920]  the real deal bush triple the size of government with the democrats obama is set to quadruple it
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:31.640]  in the first four years and saying to cut the budget and have insulting people lies and you
[2:23:31.640 --> 2:23:36.600]  talk about this not being left or right i mean how do we get the corruption out of both parties
[2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:44.120]  uh voting you know thing is that that's what we have to figure out that's what we as the people
[2:23:44.120 --> 2:23:50.600]  have to figure out and we have to put the fire on them saying look if you don't vote the way that we
[2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:57.960]  feel you should vote as the people then you're going to be out and you know we wind up impeaching
[2:23:57.960 --> 2:24:03.080]  you know we don't wait for them to tell their thing of we wind up impeaching uh every member
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:08.280]  of congress who is not uh uh they're working for the people and just working for themselves we
[2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:13.560]  want we wind up impeaching them well if there's a if there's a legal way we can do that out of
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:18.280]  there is there is a legal way of doing that i think that's what we should do is uh make them
[2:24:18.280 --> 2:24:22.520]  realize that we're going to impeach them if they don't start uh thinking of the best interest of
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:26.520]  the people that they represent chuck you can't see this because you're not watching prison
[2:24:26.520 --> 2:24:32.280]  planet dot tv right now but for viewers i have the uh federally written report a secret report
[2:24:32.280 --> 2:24:35.960]  and law enforcement sensitive for the state of missouri and we have these from all over the country
[2:24:36.840 --> 2:24:41.880]  and it says constitutional party campaign for liberty ron paul bob bar these members are usually
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:46.920]  supporters of and it goes on demonizing they have a picture of the don't tread on me flag they said
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:51.400]  if somebody's wearing a shirt or has a bumper sticker they're dangerous but that's what glimb
[2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:57.000]  back's using for the very symbol of what you guys are launching this is what our founding fathers did
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:04.120]  our founding fathers aren't bad no no not at all i i i i really respect ron paul i admire him i
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:11.480]  admire his dedication and i admire his uh staunchness on the constitution you know that it's a solid
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:18.840]  up for a formula and that we cannot deviate from and so that's why i'm a big supporter of ron paul
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:25.960]  and and we just got to uh you know it's so frustrating i you know i i just i don't know
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:31.000]  the thing is i don't know what to do personally all i can do is write articles about it and
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:36.120]  uh and state how i feel about it and and it's up to the people the people are the ones going to
[2:25:36.120 --> 2:25:42.520]  make the difference not not chuck norris not alex jones it's going to be the the people as a whole
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:47.640]  that's going to make the difference in our country i can do is say to them here's the way you know
[2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:52.680]  issue we believe it should go and either they accepted or they don't accept it and in the
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:57.480]  direction of our country will depend on that we we've we've got some dark times coming if we
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:02.120]  don't start making some changes well exactly our times in our country well in closing chuck norris
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:06.120]  that's what's happening and you recognize it everybody's waking up on the left and right
[2:26:06.120 --> 2:26:11.000]  tyranny is here i'm sure you've heard they want to use 20 000 regular army troops to patrol america
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:15.800]  they're putting army liaisons in every major department obama setting up youth brigades a
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:20.840]  million person group and they've now launched it uh that will go door to door canvassing for him
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:27.240]  with federal funding uh i mean if it comes down to gun confiscation which they're now proposing
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:31.880]  because of what's happening with the collapse of mexico they're blaming on america i mean i
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:36.040]  you know do we just say no to gun confiscation do we turn them in and go to the fema camps
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:41.720]  well i don't think it's not getting my gun you know uh you know the thing is is that uh i don't
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:47.400]  think they want to come to texas and try that no i agree so they come to texas and try to confiscate
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:52.120]  our guns they're uh they're gonna be in a in a world of hurt well the declaration of independence
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:56.840]  says it's our right in duty and government becomes destructive of our form of government
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:27:01.240]  to to remove it so that's what i'm saying the government the criminal elements of it are gearing
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:04.680]  up to and nobody's been a bigger supporter of the military police than you and the police are upset
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:08.360]  they're telling me they don't like what's happening like you said the troops don't like what's
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:13.320]  happening i think obama and the globalists seem to back off oh you know they will they will
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:18.760]  you know uh you know because you know when it gets right down to the grassroots they're cowards
[2:27:18.760 --> 2:27:23.080]  and uh and they're not going to do anything that was going to turn the people against them
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:28.440]  and so uh the thing is that uh we did we the people got to stay strong we got to stand up
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:35.240]  stay strong and say this is the way we uh want you to uh uh regulate our our country and if you
[2:27:35.240 --> 2:27:40.120]  don't do it we will get you out of office we'll impeach you or whatever it takes for us to get
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:45.800]  you out of office and you're going to start to uh representing us as a people or you are you're not
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:49.960]  going to be around you're going to be unemployed chug norris what irritates me with this government

[2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:03.160]  then plus their uh pension and welfare and benefits all that they get a hundred percent for the rest
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:08.120]  of life it's it's totally unfair and they want more more more and they want more and they still

[2:34:11.560 --> 2:34:16.600]  that they have committed crimes not just made off and others do you support state investigations if
[2:34:16.600 --> 2:34:20.760]  the feds won't do it to go after these corrupt brokerage and bank heads that are doing all this
[2:34:20.760 --> 2:34:25.160]  criminal activity and shipping the money overseas i think this has been life in prison i think every
[2:34:25.160 --> 2:34:31.000]  one of them is a criminal and they should all face prison time for the the horrible mess they've
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:37.080]  put our country into and uh and for them to get received these payout benefits is just is just
[2:34:37.080 --> 2:34:44.520]  horrible and uh i really do i i i really believe that they should all go to prison made off all
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:49.640]  the way down to all of them and stanford especially too you know but he's from texas so he should
[2:34:49.640 --> 2:34:55.400]  definitely go to prison but uh no they should all be incarcerated and uh and for what they have
[2:34:55.400 --> 2:34:59.160]  done to our country all right chuck norris we appreciate you will be listening in two and a

[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:49.880]  just you know he's being careful how he puts it out and he's saying we're not you're not taking
[2:35:49.880 --> 2:35:53.800]  our guns we're not getting rid of the borders he supports the state sovereignty movement you just
[2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:57.960]  heard that i've got a gut folks and i believe chuck norris i know chuck norris is a good guy
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:03.160]  and he's very humble he's he's becoming educated you gotta talk to him behind the scenes
[2:36:04.760 --> 2:36:09.960]  that said um the the establishment knows there's a massive movement against the new world or
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:14.120]  in tyranny that's why beck's talking about it now and what they're doing is they're mimicking the ron
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:18.840]  paul move to get volunteers and i think it may be another faction of the globalist is kind of
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:23.880]  scared of the of the faction with obama this is some counter balancing here on the cia admits
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:27.960]  they've been on beck's show they like what about the bob effect and you know bob bair and the cia
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:33.320]  guys robert bair goes hell let it come i don't want this to get violent and and neither does
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:40.840]  chuck norris either does jack mclean but um this is a very sophisticated thing but it's good to
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:47.880]  keep channels open with chuck norris it's it's good that you know we be engaging here uh and
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:53.320]  and tracking this because we are the tip of the spear you know info wars dot com is ranked i think
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:57.880]  20 000 times bigger than glenn beck dot com prison planet dot com's i think five thousand times
[2:36:57.880 --> 2:37:02.600]  bigger than glenn beck so they kind of have the zombie mainline tv viewers we have all the activists
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:06.760]  and two million listeners an hour beck's tv show us two and a half million viewers it's kind of a
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:13.560]  paper tiger you see the most unreported thing is how big this little operation is and we're only
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:18.280]  one thing so we're going to be talking to a true fighter of the new world order coming up but i but
[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:22.920]  i do i do appreciate chuck norris and he's saying some really good things and you know he's trying to
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:26.840]  work in the system going with republicans and going with mainline stuff but he's getting a lot
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:31.320]  more radical right now and this is mainlining all the info we put out so they're going to find beck
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:35.720]  they're going to find norris they're going to come right to us ladies and gentlemen just like
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:40.680]  you know zeitgeist they put me in it without asking sent millions people to us other people
[2:37:40.680 --> 2:37:46.200]  attack us sends them right to us i mean so we're attacked it sends people to us when people are
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:50.680]  having to mimic us and i'm not saying norris is doing that because he's always been anti you know
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:55.800]  globalist beck is clearly doing that i mean i know i have the you know the gut of the the intel the
[2:37:55.800 --> 2:38:00.200]  facts i know it i'm not an idiot um you know he reached right off uh but the fact that they're
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:05.720]  having to capitulate and now act like us shows we're winning we're going to go to uh jack mclean
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:09.160]  will hold it a little bit in the next hours and i'm getting them on late here uh in about four or
[2:38:09.160 --> 2:38:13.880]  five minutes after this uh video clip where i reach out to the obama supporters and shadow
[2:38:13.880 --> 2:38:18.040]  the left-right paradigm stay with us at prison planet dot tv simulcast with gc and radio network
[2:38:18.040 --> 2:38:21.800]  and the info wars radio network don't forget jason bermus coming up tonight night and midnight stay with
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:40.600]  us the obama deception is about who the real barack obama is not the right wing version or the
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:46.520]  left wing version we cut through all that we show who's financing the lies he is told and what his
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:57.080]  real agenda is the obama deception will be the first major documentary put out after his election
[2:38:57.080 --> 2:39:03.080]  that is critical all the right wing guys are still making films about is he really from kenya or is
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:08.760]  he a communist we're not touching any of those red herrings whether they're true or not we don't know
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:14.280]  we can't prove it we do know he lied about keeping troops in iraq and afghanistan we do know he lied
[2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:19.160]  about warrantless wiretapping we do know he lied about shutting down camps we do know that he lied
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:24.120]  about getting rid of nafta and gatton is now expanding it and so this film is about obama
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:29.720]  being a puppet who he works for and then we get past the puppet to the real agenda of his controllers
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:38.120]  barack obama is controlled by offshore banks this film details how they bankrupt the world economy
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:43.480]  how they control the currencies of the planet and how the bankers want to destroy the economy so they
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:48.680]  can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar that's why the obama deception is so important
[2:39:48.680 --> 2:39:53.480]  because it gives you the master plan it gives you the big overarching agenda so you understand how
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:58.120]  the world really works and where this planet's going and it gives you the viewer the choice
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:03.720]  to be conned to be a sucker by the republicans the rush limbaugh is on the right and by the controlled
[2:40:03.720 --> 2:40:09.480]  left the obamas or whether you want to finally break the spell break the paradigm and realize
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:14.120]  they're all bought and paid for and the real enemy are these private banks running these giant ponzi
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:27.480]  schemes when the public finds out they've had their entire futures robbed when they find out that
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:33.320]  a total tyranny has been brought into place they are going to get so angry the elite has to bring
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:37.240]  in the police state they have to put regular army troops on the streets they have to have
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:42.920]  female camps they have to get rid of pavius corpus and have secret arrest because the public is
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:47.640]  going to be an open revolt and the government admits they're gearing up to use the military against
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:55.720]  the american people six months before obama was elected when he was still an underdog we had figured
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:41:00.440]  out that he was the heir apparent that he was the anointed one that he was the special person
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:05.400]  of the elite was going to put in power to sell the public on their agenda then i saw how the media
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:10.600]  was getting behind him in such a unified way and i knew the media likes to pose as liberal
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:13.720]  or conservative but really they're owned by the bomb makers they're owned by the military industrial
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:19.000]  complex the big banks so they had to come in with a madison avenue fraud they had to put
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:24.280]  a black face on the new world order as krs one and webshirt harpley and many others have said
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:29.640]  they had to give people a stake in it with just the surface packaging of oh look he's black
[2:41:29.640 --> 2:41:36.440]  things have changed you know everything's okay stand down this is an attempt to suppress revolution
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:42.440]  this is an attempt to suppress a massive renaissance taking place worldwide for the globalist tyranny
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:47.480]  and so that's why we've made the obama deception and that's why we're asking listeners and viewers
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:50.840]  to get the film to make copies of it to get it out to everyone they know
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:57.160]  up and one thing i want to make clear i respect
[2:41:57.160 --> 2:42:04.760]  ronk obama supporters their fervent support of him wasn't so much about obama it was about
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:11.960]  a repudiation of george bush clearly stealing two elections clearly attacking the constitution
[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:17.400]  and bill of rights from one end of the other and lying about wmds and all these wars and the
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:21.720]  million plus dead iraqis the american people don't like all this being done in their name
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:26.360]  so they were desperate for somebody who promised to change it but as soon as he got in he flip
[2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:31.720]  flopped on all of it but he didn't just stop there he then accelerated the whole program
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:41.000]  this film is reaching out to people that are supporting barack obama and it's saying please
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:45.880]  just take the time out to watch this film take the time out write down notes research the claims
[2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:51.160]  we make we're saying that no matter who's in office this agenda continues and until we address the
[2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:56.920]  power behind the throne until we address these roundtables these private banking consortiums
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:01.080]  these corporate systems that have taken over our governments just like they take over another
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:05.080]  corporation the hostile takeover until we address that nothing's going to get better
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:14.680]  the elite saw revolution brewing in the united states and all over the world against globalism
[2:43:14.680 --> 2:43:21.160]  and the globalist agenda we can actually use the hype of obama we can actually use
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:27.400]  his betrayal to once and for all wake up the people and shatter the false left-right paradigm
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:37.000]  forever you know i get passionate when i talk about the documentaries the films i make because i
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:41.960]  know the elites corrupt i know they're evil i know they've lied i know they assassinate leaders
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:46.440]  i know they're doing all these horrible things that they're totally ruthless and i just want
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:50.680]  the people to look at the information that i've discovered the information that's open
[2:43:50.680 --> 2:43:57.560]  and public for all to see and i just burn with desire for people to stop being suckered and con
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:03.800]  because if we do have a new renaissance if a large portion of the population does realize
[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:08.680]  that they've been scammed and lied to we can turn this around and so many good things can be done
[2:44:08.680 --> 2:44:18.440]  the obama deception comes to the info war march 15th at 6 p.m when i finished my sunday radio
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:26.440]  show 6 p.m it will be released at prisonplanet.tv in super high res for folks to download and

[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:42.360]  and so i want to encourage everybody out there get involved right now get the film in your hands
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:48.600]  get it out to everybody you know prisonplanet.tv and info wars.com this is america's last chance
[2:44:50.680 --> 2:44:55.240]  this film can and will change the minds of people that are under obama's spell
[2:44:58.040 --> 2:45:04.120]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are back live here and we decided to launch it a few days early
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:08.920]  because we literally had the fbi calling up the office asking where our office was and asking
[2:45:08.920 --> 2:45:12.280]  where our server locations were and then not telling us why they were asking so i said
[2:45:12.280 --> 2:45:19.400]  sypina my lawyer uh so we went ahead and launched it um wednesday night at about 7 p.m central
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:25.320]  jad mclambs me with us a little bit in the next hour and he called in earlier this week and i had
[2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:29.080]  to move on to a guest and we weren't able to talk to him much but i wanted as a most highly decorated
[2:45:29.080 --> 2:45:33.320]  police officer cop of the year twice phoenix arizona found out about the new world order
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:38.040]  stopped breaking the law stopped violating the constitution and they fired him he's been out
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:43.240]  there for almost 30 years with police and military against the new world order aid in that newsletter
[2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:48.360]  and he's one of the people's shoulders that i stand on many of us stand on today and i wanted to
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:53.240]  specifically get him to talk about a host of issues and i mean just to sum it up who do you
[2:45:53.240 --> 2:45:57.080]  expect chuck norris to go through when he goes ahead and comes out and says we need revolution
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:01.720]  the new world orders here arrest the bankers it'll be somebody like beck who understands where the
[2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:07.480]  flow is going so he's flip-flop like benedict arnold that's what he is i mean unless he apologizes
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:11.080]  and admit and for saying ron paul people should be arrested in the military should be used against
[2:46:11.080 --> 2:46:15.480]  him now he's our best friend because they understand we're the majority they tried all their secret
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:19.800]  demonization all their secret police reports saying the founding fathers were bad the new
[2:46:19.800 --> 2:46:24.040]  order didn't exist now they've been discredited and that's what's happening uh but i really in
[2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:29.080]  my heart and from analyzing it coldly believe chuck norris is good in all of this uh what's
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:37.240]  your take on all this jack mclean well brother alex uh i think uh i'm in trouble bob Chapman
[2:46:37.240 --> 2:46:44.840]  and chuck norris before me how do i deal with that but yeah i think chuck norris is a good guy
[2:46:44.840 --> 2:46:51.800]  he's good hearted i think he's a christian man and i think he means well uh he needs more
[2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:58.360]  education as you said but he's open to it praise god he's open to it and he's learning
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:09.080]  very quickly and so i think he's a great guy what about beck well i'm really not not too uh
[2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:17.000]  uh sure about beck if fox news hired him then he's got to be part of the new world order
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:22.920]  there's no question about it brother uh because fox news doesn't have anybody on there that's not
[2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:29.080]  part of supporting the new world order so that troubles me quite a bit when he went from uh
[2:47:29.720 --> 2:47:36.600]  with a cnn communist news network or one of the others uh over to fox news now and they
[2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:41.480]  won't hire anybody that doesn't go along with the program for the new world by the way just
[2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:46.040]  last week fox put out a tv program we played part of it here saying yes we implant political
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:51.880]  messages in the tv shows global warming gun control so they have this little fox news
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:56.200]  thing that acts conservative to co-op conservatives and libertarians and the enemies of the new
[2:47:56.200 --> 2:48:01.000]  world but everything else is this propaganda and fox news is filled with propaganda i agree with
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:05.480]  you but the fact that beck is having to flip over like a chameleon and go from a little pink
[2:48:05.480 --> 2:48:11.080]  new world order lizard to a you know patriot uh i don't know what to say here well i think you're
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:18.360]  right brother we should be very very suspect of him like i say fox news is controlled by the
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:25.320]  neocon trotsky it's just like the republican party and democratic party are and fox news
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:31.640]  is a part of that paradigm and they wouldn't have hired glenn beck unless he was part of it too so
[2:48:31.640 --> 2:48:36.840]  no kidding okay i want to hear you i want to shift gears now have you had a chance i know
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:40.200]  you've seen scores these over the years i've seen the same letterhead for every state
[2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:46.680]  the federal threat fusion centers put out this latest state police report the most demonizing
[2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:51.080]  of patriots ever ron paul supporters are terrorist bumper stickers are terrorist gold owners are
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:55.480]  terrorist bob bar supporters are terrorist libertarians are terrorist those that believe in
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:49:00.040]  north american union are terrorist yes there's fema camps but they're for your own good yes
[2:49:00.040 --> 2:49:04.280]  they're gonna put trips on the streets but it's for your own good uh so so they went from saying
[2:49:04.280 --> 2:49:08.120]  we were liars about that they're now saying it's all happening and that we're all very dangerous
[2:49:08.120 --> 2:49:18.040]  your analysis of that well i i was there in the phoenix police department uh oh 20 years ago
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:26.120]  when that flyer came out from the fbi listing all these people as you know a patriot uh those
[2:49:26.120 --> 2:49:32.120]  that mentioned the constitution too many times are domestic terrorists patriots are terrorist
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:41.000]  uh christians are terrorists they had a word for them that uh lesbian uh attorney general janet
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:48.120]  reno cult members but reno yeah the ones that believe in a uh coming uh
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:55.080]  destruction of the world are and that's what she would call the i don't have that thing here in
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:50:00.520]  front of me so i don't know she she she said it on 60 minutes she said on christians that's christian
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:06.520]  she said on 60 minutes that all second coming of christ christians are dangerous cult members
[2:50:06.520 --> 2:50:13.800]  that's the quote that's right and uh that's in that brochure for police eyes only it was handed
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:20.520]  out in phoenix to the uh sheriff's department and to the phoenix police department was for
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:25.880]  our eyes only we weren't supposed to let the public know about it but they listed christians and
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:32.120]  constitutionalists and anybody that's standing up to the federal government as domestic terrorists
[2:50:32.840 --> 2:50:39.400]  and that's 20 years ago brother so i'm sure that they continue that list and i'm not surprised at all
[2:50:40.760 --> 2:50:44.840]  you know they put america freedom to fascism in there next to the turner diaries
[2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:49.720]  and basically say it's white supremacist a jewish guy who made a thing about the federal reserve
[2:50:49.720 --> 2:50:55.880]  yeah right i mean you know i mean it's just it you know it it's just unbelievable stay there our
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:51:03.960]  guest is officer jack mclean will be right back millions of americans are beginning to realize
[2:51:03.960 --> 2:51:08.920]  the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the us in the world and for the first time
[2:51:08.920 --> 2:51:13.400]  in their lives they are feeling the need for preparedness ready reserve foods has been in

[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:34.200]  this new group of uh lawmen and soldiers that have formed a group called oath keepers
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:40.600]  and they have a list of eight things that they say orders we will not obey
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:48.680]  today and their website is uh getting so many hits it's incredible in just two weeks that
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:56.840]  they've been alive but we find in law enforcement the military more soldiers more police are out
[2:56:57.480 --> 2:57:03.320]  and and they see what's going on in america especially the military over there they say
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:08.120]  they're supposed to be over there saving iraq yet they've killed a million three hundred thousand
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:16.600]  in a genocidal program over there and um and and yet they see their nation falling apart
[2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:25.000]  and they they are listening and and studying and looking and they are finding out it's all on purpose
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:32.280]  so praise god the enemy uh the antichrist uh synagogue of satan that's running all of this
[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:38.440]  in america today is totally in control of our military and the white house and the senate the
[2:57:38.440 --> 2:57:47.240]  congress and the supreme court are turning more people to patriotism than ever before true patriotism

[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:30.120]  ovation mainline conservatives don't want the war either it's this illusion just like there's it's an
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:34.520]  illusion that hispanics won open borders when upwards of 80 and gallup polls won him shot

[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:29.080]  southwest film festival here in austin texas tonight at the ritz it will be sold out downtown
[3:08:29.080 --> 3:08:34.440]  austin for south by southwest and i have to say i've got the filmmakers in here next week when
[3:08:34.440 --> 3:08:38.280]  they when they contacted me a year ago wanted to follow me around at bill berg in new york and
[3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:43.960]  here in austin i just said no i don't want to do it because every other national tv thing i've
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:49.160]  ever done has been a hit piece the discovery channel famous director who made paradise lost in
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:57.640]  some kind of monster and brother's keeper said it was a positive piece he made it with a full budget
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:09:02.280]  of 3.4 million dollars with a five-part episode with myself and three of the major episodes
[3:09:03.720 --> 3:09:07.160]  and they told him you got to basically change this and demonize these people and we're not
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:11.480]  going to let you put it out and he said but i have a director's cut and they said no and so it never
[3:09:11.480 --> 3:09:20.600]  aired i mean 3.4 million shelved because it was real i don't know how this i fc is going to allow
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:26.280]  this to air i don't know how but i guess because it's independent film channel and they're supposedly
[3:09:26.280 --> 3:09:32.840]  radical it can but it shows jack mclean was positive it's about 60 me 20 30 jack and then a
[3:09:32.840 --> 3:09:40.280]  few other people and it's i mean it's just it's about 90 our side i mean i've never in fact it's
[3:09:40.280 --> 3:09:44.840]  not even fair it leans towards us but it leans towards the truth i've never seen anything like
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:50.920]  it but the channel's doing a feature on myself it starts airing next week in the build up to it
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:55.320]  and they're doing an hour long special that's going to air and then another south by southwest
[3:09:55.320 --> 3:10:00.440]  special and then i'm going to be interviewed with them on what is going to be a lot of pbs
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:05.320]  stations around the country and i mean this isn't fake either i get around these people
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:08.760]  that are regional pbs directors like yes we know all about the private banks the new order and they
[3:10:08.760 --> 3:10:12.600]  control obama and yes we know all about this and we know all about that what we gotta do
[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:17.800]  see the rebellion is here folks see their mind control works by
[3:10:19.800 --> 3:10:24.520]  by making the general public think patriotism's evil and saying a new order is crazy and or it's
[3:10:24.520 --> 3:10:31.240]  racist it's codeword for this and that when it's not it's the reality and so it is exploding right
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:36.600]  now and we'll see if this thing is coming up in what april 15 when the big special airs and they
[3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:45.080]  got these other specials mainly on myself airing up to it i fc produced waking life you know that
[3:10:45.080 --> 3:10:49.400]  they pay for the film rick link letter made for a theatrical release and then on tv that airs all
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:55.720]  the time and it later was sold hbo so they're a fans at i fc i'm told to head honcho's a fan so
[3:10:55.720 --> 3:11:02.040]  that's why that's happening pbs in denver is give i i said they could just have it i'm not usually
[3:11:02.040 --> 3:11:07.320]  you know they say 70 bucks and you get a you know pledging for local pbs in denver and you get
[3:11:07.320 --> 3:11:11.480]  in the person that's you know and they're buying the film i just said take it have the film uh
[3:11:11.480 --> 3:11:17.240]  they're doing that right now in denver at a at a public tv station and with the phone banks of
[3:11:17.240 --> 3:11:21.160]  the people and and they're they're taking a risk folks i mean they're doing it it's on air now
[3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:27.800]  see the police the military the people that work at tv stations they're just they all know when
[3:11:27.800 --> 3:11:32.120]  fox news all the time sets me up and higher ups cancel it like oh we're all big fans we know about
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:35.720]  the new order here oh yeah we're sick of working here we all know about it i talked to folks at
[3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:41.480]  clear channel all the place they all know i talked to executives they know they don't like it folks
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:46.680]  because even the mid-level elites are figuring out this is going to ruin their future too this new
[3:11:46.680 --> 3:11:50.840]  world order isn't a pretty thing jack mclean i want to go back through those 10 points from
[3:11:51.560 --> 3:11:57.560]  oath dash keepers blogspot.com and and and as you read each one i want to then make comments
[3:11:57.560 --> 3:12:00.760]  and you make comments and then go to calls people you'll be with us for the rest of the hour now
[3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:05.560]  and we'll go to jim brad darrell bob and ronnie but specifically what i just said right there this
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:12.600]  is how revolutions are won is through the mind that's right absolutely that's why they're trying
[3:12:12.600 --> 3:12:21.880]  to control our minds and doing a pretty good job of it sadly on tv and in the newspapers and all
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:25.560]  jack what did you think because you'd you'd you'd had see think the production company interview
[3:12:25.560 --> 3:12:28.680]  you know i said i have seen you so i don't know about that and i mentioned she think you remember
[3:12:28.680 --> 3:12:34.280]  i'm coming out an interview on you they actually delivered they're actually on our side unbelievable
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:41.560]  i i kind of chastised them when they came in and told them how many uh film crews we have coming
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:48.280]  out that say they're on our side and then they twisted and make us the devil themselves and so
[3:12:48.280 --> 3:12:53.400]  they said that that wasn't what they were all about and so we had to wait to see what their
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:59.080]  product was first and if you say it's good then that's good i'm really surprised unless unless
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:07.880]  i fc that owns it but but uh see the production company has final cut but i fc could still
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:12.520]  say they weren't gonna air but but it that's not happening yeah and and and you know they would
[3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:16.760]  have me miked up with bill deberg i was running around to the hotel they could hear me 100 yards

[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:26.520]  truthful these guys act like they're our friends but i but they may not be i i'm like i think they
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:31.320]  i think they're actually gonna be good but i said and then i come back the hotel and they go no

[3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:26.120]  dash keepers dot blogspot.com police and military organization okay our 10 points let's go through
[3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:29.880]  them and comment about how you know everything they're saying is backed up that what they're
[3:16:29.880 --> 3:16:34.920]  saying is being planned oh it's absolutely being planned they're right on target all of
[3:16:34.920 --> 3:16:39.320]  these things are going to be orders they're going to be given and they're saying no we're not going
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:45.160]  to enforce them it says here number one we will not obey and well in any order disarm the american
[3:16:45.160 --> 3:16:51.480]  people and they say here right after at the attempt to disarm the people on april 19th
[3:16:52.440 --> 3:16:59.480]  1775 was the spark of open conflict in the american revolution that vile attempt was an
[3:16:59.480 --> 3:17:05.560]  act of war and the american people fought back in justified righteous self-defense of their
[3:17:05.560 --> 3:17:11.640]  natural rights any such order today would also be an act of war against the american people and
[3:17:11.640 --> 3:17:17.800]  thus an act of treason we will not make war on our own people and we will not commit treason by
[3:17:17.800 --> 3:17:25.000]  obeying any such treasonous order nor will we assist or support any such attempt to disarm the
[3:17:25.000 --> 3:17:30.760]  people by any government entity state or federal let me stop you there i want to go back through
[3:17:30.760 --> 3:17:35.080]  the 10 points and we can read more of that but yeah it's a spell they've tried to hire thugs
[3:17:35.080 --> 3:17:38.760]  they've tried to demonize the people they've tried to make the cops scared of the public
[3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:43.640]  instead of not with the people as guardians and protectors in a very honorable sacred position
[3:17:43.640 --> 3:17:48.600]  and i am seeing with police and military it's like the spell is breaking it's like they're what
[3:17:48.600 --> 3:17:54.600]  what i didn't know mike it's like a spell isn't it it is a spell and it's their training because
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:17:59.000]  when i was on the phoenix police department the sixth largest city in the united states we had
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:08.040]  2600 men and women underarms and we were taken in for in-service training repeatedly and they were
[3:18:08.040 --> 3:18:15.880]  massaging our brains and brainwashing us about all these things and uh and i realized it because
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:21.640]  i was 32 when i went into law enforcement with these 20 and 21 year olds and you'd already
[3:18:21.640 --> 3:18:26.360]  been in the you know over in the vietnam area so you were already in the vietnam war
[3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:31.640]  yeah and so i was uh and i'd been in business too after i got out of the vietnam war in
[3:18:31.640 --> 3:18:38.040]  washington dc in los angeles and did very very well and so i had a lot of background
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:43.720]  that these young 20 and 21 year old kids didn't have some of them were still living home with
[3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:49.640]  their mom and dad at 20 and 21 years of age and they would come in and brainwash us every day
[3:18:49.640 --> 3:18:55.240]  with with statements like you can't trust the american people out there to ever come to your
[3:18:55.240 --> 3:19:00.360]  aid if you ever need help you can only trust fellow officers while meanwhile the media while
[3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:06.360]  mean while meanwhile the media was demonizing telling americans it's not right to defend yourself
[3:19:06.360 --> 3:19:12.680]  don't help cops stand down they'll handle it uh-huh so so see brainwashing the public not to
[3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:16.440]  you know defend themselves or help the police and to stand down and then tell them the cops the
[3:19:16.440 --> 3:19:22.440]  public won't help you go ahead that's right that's right and so when we were in the police academy
[3:19:22.440 --> 3:19:29.080]  i was 32 years of age brave god and the other 20 21 year olds were in there and every day
[3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:35.400]  somebody would come in a captain or a major or somebody and give us a statement that would
[3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:41.720]  separate us psychologically separate us from the people and i knew that that was absolutely
[3:19:41.720 --> 3:19:47.080]  wrong and i didn't understand at that time brother why they were doing it but later on i discovered
[3:19:47.080 --> 3:19:51.320]  why all right let's continue with that and go through the 10 points and then phone calls
[3:19:51.320 --> 3:19:56.680]  quickly when we come back when i go back through those points from oath-keepers.blogspot.com

[3:25:24.200 --> 3:25:28.600]  but when you study them they believe in good and evil and they serve the god of this world
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:35.560]  and i think jack we should thank the creator of the universe right now here on air because
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:40.760]  is we're being given a chance to see what true evil is we're being given a chance through
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:44.200]  myself yourself and millions of others who've spoken out to others they're being given their
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:50.360]  chance to go against evil when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord lives
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:54.440]  up a standard against it they're being given their chance aren't they jack one life to live
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:26:00.520]  people need to choose don't they they surely do have to choose remember in the bible god said i'd
[3:26:00.520 --> 3:26:06.840]  rather you be hot or cold and not lukewarm and most of our christians across the nation go to
[3:26:06.840 --> 3:26:13.800]  church every uh week and warm a pew with their dairy air thinking that's what god meant by
[3:26:13.800 --> 3:26:20.680]  occupying the land until my return they occupy a pew sunday morning and it's sad but i think
[3:26:20.680 --> 3:26:26.440]  most of the christians today except for the ones that are waking up by the hundreds of thousands
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:31.800]  today are the lukewarm christians that he said he would spew out of his mouth he would rather
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:38.120]  you be against him a hundred percent or for him a hundred percent but not lukewarm and so
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:44.200]  we've got to follow psalms 94 16 in the bible where he said rise up for me against the evildoers
[3:26:44.200 --> 3:26:49.800]  and stand up for me against the workers of iniquity and that's what we haven't been doing but are
[3:26:49.800 --> 3:26:57.640]  beginning to do now alex thanks to you and and others out there that are sounding the alarm
[3:26:57.640 --> 3:27:03.240]  you are the watchman on the wall that are blowing this the trumpet and sounding the alarm as the
[3:27:03.240 --> 3:27:09.640]  enemy just doesn't approach the enemy's here now and got his boot on our throat right now our neck
[3:27:10.200 --> 3:27:17.560]  and so praise god for alex jones and uh the outreach you have brother and uh i'm just so
[3:27:17.560 --> 3:27:25.240]  pleased to be on with you and uh tell you that we have a nation of sheep which always results in a
[3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:33.400]  government of wolves and this uh this oath keepers is not a nation of sheep they're they're not sheep
[3:27:33.400 --> 3:27:39.800]  they're standing up as god told us to do against the evildoers and taking a stand and it's very
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:45.560]  unhealthy in the military to do that pat tilman did it made the mistake of telling him over there
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:51.880]  in afghanistan that he was going to he had discovered that we were only there protecting the opium
[3:27:51.880 --> 3:28:01.800]  field the crops that we planted 30 percent as much or 30 percent more now um and uh it's actually
[3:28:01.800 --> 3:28:06.520]  10 times now jack what you think it's actually 10 times now but yeah at the time yeah i was
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:13.400]  listening to bbc radio last week on my exam and then cbc radio and they had top government people
[3:28:13.400 --> 3:28:18.040]  from all these governments including ours admitting that oh our troops guard the poppy fields but
[3:28:18.040 --> 3:28:23.320]  both reports it's a talking point said well we have to to make the afghans like us but now there's
[3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:28.840]  i mean our it's admitted they guard the the drugs yes and pat tilman said he was going to come back
[3:28:28.840 --> 3:28:35.000]  and tell and going to take over the anti-war movement and three days later he was shot three
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:41.880]  times in the forehead perfect shot and killed and so you don't want to do that over there you don't
[3:28:41.880 --> 3:28:47.800]  want to stand up and say i know every day you tell us to shoot these little girls and little boys
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:53.800]  in the head with our guns in iraq but i'm not going to do it anymore and then you get suicided
[3:28:53.800 --> 3:28:58.760]  a few days later that's what we've heard from seven soldiers that have come back from iraq oh
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:03.240]  they've had that's why the suicides are eight seven to eight times any previous war because
[3:29:03.240 --> 3:29:07.640]  they're killing people yes because they're suiciding them they're taking them out just
[3:29:07.640 --> 3:29:11.960]  like that little girl from prescott arizona the little mormon girl that went in the army
[3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:16.360]  and became an interpreter and she went over and interpreted at these
[3:29:17.640 --> 3:29:25.560]  torture camps and she got in two days she was so stressed out from watching the torture of these
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:32.840]  people people having pliers put on their gonads and squeezed and she said i'm not doing this anymore
[3:29:32.840 --> 3:29:39.080]  and i'm i'm not going to do it and so two days later she shot herself in the head with her army
[3:29:39.080 --> 3:29:45.960]  rifle they say but we know it was uh suicided by the military for her say no stay there stay there

[3:46:56.600 --> 3:47:01.480]  they look at africa where some countries 45 percent you know die of age that's put in the
[3:47:01.480 --> 3:47:06.440]  vaccines they've been caught so in third world nations in some cities in india they sterilize
[3:47:06.440 --> 3:47:09.960]  more than half the women the government just came and grabbed them to get imf and world bank money
[3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:18.040]  it isn't my opinion it's state apartment memorandum 200 1973 declassified 1992 dr Henry Kissinger cia
[3:47:18.040 --> 3:47:25.240]  directive main u.s policy it is the 1996 and others united nations biological diversity
[3:47:25.240 --> 3:47:30.200]  assessment saying they want to get a world government in and then with soft kill weapons
[3:47:30.200 --> 3:47:34.520]  with one child policies get rid of us it's to be phased in people say well there's you know
[3:47:34.520 --> 3:47:38.920]  six and a half billion people where's the population reduction black men at tiskegee go killing our
[3:47:38.920 --> 3:47:45.000]  troops in chemical biological testing you know cancer going from one in 33 to now one in your

[3:47:55.080 --> 3:48:00.920]  their cashless society tracker car when you buy and sell RFID face scan track then once everything's
[3:48:00.920 --> 3:48:06.120]  locked down then they're going to hit us with the mass extermination you understand i do but i'm
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:11.320]  left asking myself the question you know who's who's left to control and then and art the mass is
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:17.240]  needed to you know by the elite no no that's why that's why all the top futures and all the top
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:22.840]  globalist and it's in my film in game we show their quotes you know wired magazine why the
[3:48:22.840 --> 3:48:27.560]  future doesn't need us the elite you know bill joy owner of sun microsystem was giving a few
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:33.960]  examples or hundreds in in 99 goes to an elite conference of 200 it company owners the guys
[3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:38.440]  a multi-millionaire on sun some microsystems and the leader they're saying we don't need
[3:48:38.440 --> 3:48:43.080]  manufacturers or people anymore we're making a decision whether everyone will just be killed
[3:48:44.280 --> 3:48:48.440]  or you know how many people we're going to keep i mean so this is openly discussed everywhere
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:54.600]  jack mclean you want to explain it that's right brother it is true and uh just recently our
[3:48:54.600 --> 3:49:01.960]  military intel people gave us a report here that uh china is talking about coming in now
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:07.640]  with biological weapons and dropping them on the american people to take over america
[3:49:07.640 --> 3:49:14.360]  and killing all the people in america and believe me that they are controlled by the new world order
[3:49:14.360 --> 3:49:22.040]  china is and we know that and so um but anyway they're thinking of biologicals to take us out
[3:49:22.040 --> 3:49:28.680]  america is hated by the international criminal elite because we are so in love with freedom
[3:49:28.680 --> 3:49:35.480]  and we've had such freedom that they can't stand us we were not like the austrians or the english

[3:50:07.640 --> 3:50:12.680]  just a ploy i think the chinese are under the control of the international criminal elite
[3:50:13.320 --> 3:50:18.760]  and they're going to do exactly what they're told to do to america and this is just ploys that they
[3:50:18.760 --> 3:50:24.680]  do to make it look like we're fighting each other and that we're having contentious uh
[3:50:24.680 --> 3:50:29.960]  situations with that's like that uh the surveillance plane where they didn't follow

[3:54:58.920 --> 3:55:06.760]  howdy hello sir hey um mr mclam i would like you to talk to the uh other police officers out there
[3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:12.280]  that are listening and give them some advice on the following and that is when they are faced with
[3:55:12.280 --> 3:55:19.400]  the situation that is uh they're asked to enforce an unconstitutional act what is a method they can
[3:55:19.400 --> 3:55:24.680]  follow such as on my job usually i will go to my immediate supervisor for satisfaction out of
[3:55:24.680 --> 3:55:30.760]  courtesy but if i had an issue that i feel is very important i can very well go over his head to my
[3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:39.160]  director um so that is one thing i would like to talk about just uh and uh as far as i want to
[3:55:39.160 --> 3:55:43.880]  recommend everybody in the audience i'm sure everybody knows two people i just got my mother
[3:55:43.880 --> 3:55:48.920]  and my sister on board everybody probably knows at least two people that listen to alex already
[3:55:48.920 --> 3:55:54.520]  and that they can become members of prison planet and then we can triple this thing uh alex great
[3:55:54.520 --> 3:55:59.240]  job uh you know i'm looking for uh some more money bombs and maybe even a money bomb for
[3:55:59.240 --> 3:56:04.760]  ramos copy on and the farm or down in texas that's being sued and he has to pay like a seventy
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:11.480]  something dollar fine um appreciate it man much love thank you so much uh jack briefly yeah the
[3:56:11.480 --> 3:56:15.320]  officers out there there's no doubt the globalists are wicked and setting up a new old order they
[3:56:15.320 --> 3:56:19.480]  admit it now all your intelligence reports for years said we were crazy it wasn't real now it's
[3:56:19.480 --> 3:56:25.320]  all admitted i mean they got to get off the fence don't they that's right they have to take a side
[3:56:25.320 --> 3:56:31.160]  they have to choose a side in the side that the international on will enslave their own
[3:56:31.160 --> 3:56:37.400]  children and their own families so there's no other choice to make than the side of the people
[3:56:37.400 --> 3:56:44.520]  in the constitution but i want to tell the man that's called in that officers have great leeway
[3:56:45.320 --> 3:56:51.640]  when they're on the streets and they're in doing their duties every day they can make their own
[3:56:51.640 --> 3:57:00.280]  decisions of what they want to do i remember when we would pull over patriots and a guy would call
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:06.760]  in for backups and we'd come and he'd have a gun on the front seat and it was perfectly legal
[3:57:06.760 --> 3:57:11.720]  and phoenix for him to have a gun on the front seat but the officers were trained that patriots
[3:57:11.720 --> 3:57:17.640]  are bad so they said we're gonna tell we're gonna tell a lie we're gonna say that his coat was over
[3:57:17.640 --> 3:57:23.640]  the gun and doing for a felony because he's a patriot and i said that no way you're not gonna
[3:57:23.640 --> 3:57:29.400]  do that if you do i'm gonna tell on you and i'm not taking the i'll take the witness stand against
[3:57:29.400 --> 3:57:34.120]  you when you get on the witness stand and lie against him and tell him it wasn't true and so
[3:57:34.120 --> 3:57:39.560]  they didn't do it and that's what we need officers to stand up and say but then they but then they
[3:57:39.560 --> 3:57:44.440]  came after you criminal act but then they came after you i'm sorry to darrell bob and ronnie we're
