[00:00.000 --> 00:27.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcast in the middle of the night, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.280 --> 00:31.760]  Alright, I have a tendency to start the broadcast and then give you a whole line-up of what's
[00:31.760 --> 00:38.200]  coming up and then miss the top story of the day, the top exclusive of the day.
[00:38.200 --> 00:47.440]  I have a lot of sources, obviously, high up in the Trump movement, the Trump campaign,
[00:47.440 --> 00:52.080]  the White House, despite all the attempts by the globalists to block that.
[00:52.080 --> 00:59.480]  And as everyone knows, Trump has been sidelining Kelly more and more and getting back to being
[00:59.480 --> 01:03.560]  the old Trump, but we've seen even more success, accelerated.
[01:03.560 --> 01:06.680]  And so some of those avenues, let's just say, have opened up.
[01:06.680 --> 01:09.320]  And the only reason I mention that is it's not a secret.
[01:09.320 --> 01:12.120]  The globalists surveil my phones, they know what's going on.
[01:12.120 --> 01:17.560]  The deep states out there, we're removing the face sucker, we're removing the parasite
[01:17.560 --> 01:20.360]  right now, but the surgery is going well.
[01:20.360 --> 01:23.000]  There is a lot of bleeding in the patient.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.840]  The patient was in critical condition on death's doorstep.
[01:26.840 --> 01:30.000]  Now we're just in critical condition, but I think we're starting to trend towards making
[01:30.000 --> 01:31.000]  it.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.640]  We're none of the woods yet.
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.840]  So you can actually pull up clips of this, and I forgot to tell the crew to pull up clips
[01:39.840 --> 01:43.680]  of a Trump during debates telling Jeb, you better watch it for what you and your brother
[01:43.680 --> 01:45.640]  did on 9-11.
[01:45.640 --> 01:49.200]  And then Jeb dropped out the next day.
[01:49.200 --> 01:54.400]  And then I was on the inside baseball with the whole thing with Ted Cruz and his dad who
[01:54.400 --> 01:57.840]  absolutely was in the CIA from all evidence.
[01:57.840 --> 01:59.360]  And there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:59.360 --> 02:01.240]  The whole CIA isn't bad.
[02:01.240 --> 02:06.760]  He just so happened to be jacked into the whole same situation with the Kennedy assassination,
[02:06.760 --> 02:10.680]  but that had Cubans all over it.
[02:10.680 --> 02:13.040]  But that's a whole other subject, Rafael Cruz.
[02:13.040 --> 02:16.000]  You saw what Cruz did right after that came out.
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.360]  He dropped out and stopped trying to steal the election.
[02:22.360 --> 02:28.040]  Trump is preparing to release the 9-11 information on the Bushes, the Clintons, Mueller's aside
[02:28.040 --> 02:29.600]  or Derv.
[02:29.600 --> 02:32.160]  And I gave Paul the information last night.
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.880]  I got the info at about 10 o'clock at night.
[02:37.880 --> 02:41.480]  And then Paul got it out this morning, and his article's important and it's got it all
[02:41.480 --> 02:45.200]  in there, but Paul's always a little reserved.
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.080]  I may have to change his headline or I may write another article myself just because
[02:49.080 --> 02:52.160]  this is much, much bigger.
[02:52.160 --> 02:55.480]  And what I was told was, you know, we know they covered up.
[02:55.480 --> 02:57.080]  We know they stood down.
[02:57.080 --> 02:58.840]  We know Mueller ran the cover up.
[02:58.840 --> 03:01.040]  That's even been in mainstream news before.
[03:01.040 --> 03:04.880]  And it ties into the corrupt elements that were in Saudi Arabia at the time, the whole
[03:04.880 --> 03:05.880]  deep state.
[03:05.880 --> 03:12.480]  And if they want to try to remove America's recovery, we're going to play the ace of spades.
[03:12.480 --> 03:16.440]  Notice I've not been pushing 9-11 trick the last year and a half.
[03:16.440 --> 03:17.440]  And that's just in the ether.
[03:17.440 --> 03:20.160]  I know how to coordinate all this because I want to make America come back.
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.600]  I don't want to demoralize this, a criminal element, stage that with the globalist to
[03:24.600 --> 03:27.520]  not take out the radical Islam, but to actually go put it in power.
[03:27.520 --> 03:30.600]  And we now know all that and it's come out 28 pages.
[03:30.600 --> 03:34.240]  But I've backed off of it because I was exposing the folks that did it.
[03:34.240 --> 03:38.640]  As we begin to heal the country, then I start backing off because that's enough pain.
[03:38.640 --> 03:43.280]  We've already gone through having our legs broken.
[03:43.280 --> 03:52.720]  But now, if we have to, ace of spades, bam, bam, bam.
[03:52.720 --> 03:56.280]  And Trump is ready to play it on you.
[03:56.280 --> 04:00.200]  So you go ahead and play your games, globalists, sorrows all over you.
[04:00.200 --> 04:02.920]  You're all going down.
[04:02.920 --> 04:03.920]  This is the broadcast.
[04:03.920 --> 04:04.920]  This is where we do it.
[04:04.920 --> 04:05.920]  We're launching it.
[04:05.920 --> 04:06.920]  We're warming up the salvo.
[04:06.920 --> 04:07.920]  No one else will do.
[04:07.920 --> 04:10.360]  The barbed wire is the shock force.
[04:10.360 --> 04:12.920]  So coming up, Roger Stone had a little talk with him last night.
[04:12.920 --> 04:15.960]  Turns out the little birdies told him as well.
[04:15.960 --> 04:18.840]  And so this is what's happening.
[04:18.840 --> 04:21.040]  So get ready.
[04:21.040 --> 04:25.920]  Anything happens to Trump, all of it, the names, who did it, the stand downs, the generals.
[04:25.920 --> 04:28.800]  Just like Pachennik says, he's been in the meetings with the generals that admitted they
[04:28.800 --> 04:32.080]  were part of it and didn't like being part of it.
[04:32.080 --> 04:38.080]  So can we come back in with Motorhead Ace of Spades?
[04:38.080 --> 04:44.080]  The ace of spades, the ace of spades, the ace of spades, the ace of spades.
[04:44.080 --> 04:45.720]  Boom, boom, boom.
[04:45.720 --> 04:47.080]  We will crush you.
[04:47.080 --> 04:48.080]  We will win.
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.280]  America will come back.
[04:50.280 --> 04:55.080]  And now the Death Star is clear to fire.
[04:55.080 --> 05:00.520]  Yes, victory.
[05:00.520 --> 05:04.320]  Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.840]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania States, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[05:08.840 --> 05:14.280]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.280 --> 05:19.680]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.680 --> 05:21.200]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.200 --> 05:27.720]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[05:27.720 --> 05:31.720]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.720 --> 05:33.120]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.440]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[05:38.440 --> 05:44.520]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.520 --> 05:50.120]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[05:50.120 --> 05:55.480]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.480 --> 06:02.480]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:25.480 --> 06:41.480]  Life is coming back, humanity is coming back, nationalism is coming back, humanity is awakening.
[06:41.480 --> 06:50.160]  The Ace of Spades, ladies and gentlemen, July 4th, 2018 will be the demarcation line of
[06:50.160 --> 06:55.200]  the launch of the new Renaissance and the true New American Century, and the beginning
[06:55.200 --> 06:56.880]  of the end of the globalist.
[06:56.880 --> 07:03.160]  As humanity prepares to face the next level of challenges, we are surpassing the globalists
[07:03.160 --> 07:07.480]  at this point at every level, but they are in their death rows, they are striking back
[07:07.480 --> 07:12.480]  with everything they've got.
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.720]  We have incredible news coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[07:16.720 --> 07:25.040]  NBC's Chuck Todd admits President Trump winning Democrats reeling.
[07:25.040 --> 07:26.040]  Isn't that amazing?
[07:26.040 --> 07:32.000]  Progressive scramble to block potential Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett because she
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.680]  is a committed Christian.
[07:36.680 --> 07:43.200]  Man who threatened to murder Rand Paul's children to gut them and smear their intestines everywhere
[07:43.200 --> 07:45.560]  is an Obama-supporting Berkeley resident.
[07:45.560 --> 07:56.240]  Of course he is, and now he's facing 10 years in prison with his ironic glasses.
[07:56.240 --> 08:03.040]  We've got so much to break down here, we've got Brian Rosses leaving ABC News after botched
[08:03.040 --> 08:06.720]  Michael Flynn report, you know where he lied and said, Flynn admits he's a Russian agent
[08:06.720 --> 08:10.480]  and it's all coming out, and he told Mueller that Trump is a Russian agent.
[08:10.480 --> 08:15.760]  No hoax, you know, Joy Behar, just got the news, yay, Trump's a Russian agent, total
[08:15.760 --> 08:19.160]  proof, ah, Tom Arnold, oh, his lawyer admits they're Russian agents, I'm going to have
[08:19.160 --> 08:23.640]  them on, total lie, hoaxing, hoaxing, hoaxing by the hoaxers.
[08:23.640 --> 08:27.560]  Bono warns that the existence of the UN, EU and NATO, that means world government are
[08:27.560 --> 08:32.920]  threatened, that's AP.
[08:32.920 --> 08:38.560]  We got all these Republicans and Trump officials being harassed everywhere, Scott Pruitt becomes
[08:38.560 --> 08:43.200]  the latest official to be harassed ahead of the EPA at a restaurant.
[08:43.200 --> 08:47.000]  It's all coming, oh and there's a secret Roe v. Wade film, filming right now with a
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.200]  lot of top stars, shooting in New Orleans, I haven't heard anything about that.
[08:52.200 --> 09:00.880]  So we're going to be getting into all of those corollary issues, but let me, ladies and gentlemen,
[09:00.880 --> 09:07.280]  let me give you the biggest news concerning the fight with the deep state that I have
[09:07.280 --> 09:11.360]  covered in a long, long time.
[09:11.360 --> 09:21.320]  I've got a lot of good contacts inside Trump world at the highest levels and now that Kelly
[09:21.320 --> 09:26.720]  is receding towards being put out to pasture, those contacts have been heating up and have
[09:26.720 --> 09:28.920]  been particularly revealing.
[09:28.920 --> 09:38.000]  So let me give you bombshell, first look information with myself and Roger Stone right
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.240]  now, it's on infowars.com, it's on newswars.com, I've tweeted it out as well, it's a Paul
[09:45.240 --> 09:53.640]  Joseph Watson story, I relayed the information directly to him, Trump to go after Mueller
[09:53.640 --> 09:59.880]  for 9-11 Saudi cover-up, now you'll remember in January of this year, here is the Lee
[09:59.880 --> 10:05.120]  Ann McAdoo report on that, next year's news today, or the news of six months from now
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.040]  today, Mueller's 9-11 cover-up connection, there's Lee Ann McAdoo's report on that,
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.800]  it's been in local Florida papers and other places that Mueller ordered the cover-up and
[10:15.800 --> 10:21.240]  the Congress knew, FBI found direct ties between the 9-11 hijackers in Saudis living in Florida,
[10:21.240 --> 10:25.160]  kept it dark, that's all the stuff we covered, how they got bin Laden out of the country,
[10:25.160 --> 10:31.040]  how they protected him, and who gave the orders in the Justice Department to do that, this
[10:31.040 --> 10:39.160]  goes to the Clintons, the Bushes, the Mueller's, the Comey's, the entire deep state, okay,
[10:39.160 --> 10:45.280]  so that is all about to come out, and so when you see some of the families of 9-11 victims
[10:45.280 --> 10:49.920]  on Tucker Carlson saying Mueller ordered that we couldn't have our lawsuit, he shut it down,
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.360]  he had the FBI not release the information, that is just the doorway to this, and so what
[10:55.360 --> 10:59.960]  I'm relaying to you is Trump, regardless of what the deep state does, is going to bring
[10:59.960 --> 11:04.040]  everything out, but he had to first get some Supreme Court justice in, turn the economy
[11:04.040 --> 11:10.560]  around, show everybody he was real, and now he's preparing to not drain the swamp, but
[11:10.560 --> 11:16.400]  basically napalm it, carpet bomb it, I mean I don't know what you want to call this, but
[11:16.400 --> 11:22.480]  I have been told that this is the gateway to the traction, that's how Trump does it,
[11:22.480 --> 11:28.120]  he enters it at one unrefutable, irrefutable point, that they covered up what happened
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.720]  on 9-11, that they blocked the lawsuits, that Mueller was the guy that quarterbacked all
[11:31.720 --> 11:38.120]  that, and then he quarterbacked the entire cover-up, brought in two days after 9-11,
[11:38.120 --> 11:42.480]  and that it goes into Saudi Arabia, it goes into the Bushes, it goes into the Clintons,
[11:42.480 --> 11:47.320]  who set it up beforehand, it goes into Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda, and Trump has them dead
[11:47.320 --> 11:50.560]  to rights, he has all the documents, he has all the admissions, and he's letting them
[11:50.560 --> 11:56.320]  know, I have the ace of spades, so just like Trump back, and we'll pull the clip up, during
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.880]  one of the debates, told you had Bush, yeah your brother did a terrible job on 9-11 standing
[12:00.880 --> 12:05.720]  down, the next day he dropped out, so we're going to play that clip coming up, the media
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.120]  criticized Trump, Trump famously called into CNN a week after 9-11 and said, boy those
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.120]  buildings sure fell strange, like there was bombs in them, you wanted everything on record
[12:14.120 --> 12:21.920]  that he knew, so deep state working with radical criminal Islam, involved in 9-11, the stand
[12:21.920 --> 12:28.200]  down all of it, the CIA building, building 7 getting blown up, Trump is preparing, and
[12:28.200 --> 12:36.280]  wants you to know, and wants us to know, and I am the individual that is supposed to say
[12:36.280 --> 12:41.560]  the super hard dangerous things up front, I'm very honored, I've asked for that position,
[12:41.560 --> 12:45.560]  it's very honorable position, very dangerous position, but yeah there's the video, Donald
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.840]  Trump 9-11 bombs exploded in the WTC towers, boom, so Trump's very smart laying his breadcrumbs
[12:50.840 --> 12:56.920]  to the point where he could turn around and go after him, he knows everything about this,
[12:56.920 --> 13:03.160]  so I bring you now for this segment the next Roger Stone, Roger I don't think we can hype
[13:03.160 --> 13:08.920]  this enough, how big this is, and how huge this is, I called you last night at 1030 after
[13:08.920 --> 13:13.440]  I got off the phone and then received the information, you said that you were getting
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.840]  concurrent info, and this is just the beginning of Trump's big rollout, his ace of spades,
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.200]  I mean would you call this, the economy's his real ace of spades, and telling the truth
[13:22.200 --> 13:26.200]  to his ace of spades, but when it comes to devastating with each state, this torpedo,
[13:26.200 --> 13:34.800]  this black arrow, into the heart of smog, I mean this is what needs to be done for justice,
[13:34.800 --> 13:39.400]  but it's also must strike complete fear into the deep state.
[13:39.400 --> 13:45.600]  Well I think the president has now only fully become aware of the extent of Robert Mueller's
[13:45.600 --> 13:54.240]  disastrous record as FBI director, it is indisputable that he systematically ignored multiple reports
[13:54.240 --> 14:01.360]  about a Sarah Sota Florida flight school where five of nine Saudi hijackers were training
[14:01.360 --> 14:08.000]  for the assault on America on 9-11, there were multiple complaints from neighbors about
[14:08.000 --> 14:15.320]  strange activities among these men who according to flight instructor showed an amazing interest
[14:15.320 --> 14:24.080]  in how to fly and take off, but no interest in how to land, this was reported to Jeb Bush's
[14:24.080 --> 14:30.320]  Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the same thing as the state police in say Louisiana
[14:30.320 --> 14:36.720]  or the Texas Rangers there in Texas, who complained repeatedly to the FBI, sent reports
[14:36.720 --> 14:43.040]  to the FBI, which Robert Mueller systematically ignored.
[14:43.040 --> 14:51.000]  So his role as being complicit in the cover-up of 9-11 is demonstrable, the president himself
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.600]  is going to ultimately make the case, but it's the tip of the iceberg in terms of this
[14:57.600 --> 15:05.520]  quote-unquote public servant who Lindsey Graham describes as beyond reproach, three, the first
[15:05.520 --> 15:11.720]  three suspects he arrested in the anthrax matter were the wrong men, the fourth man he
[15:11.720 --> 15:19.400]  ultimately arrested, died mysteriously in custody, there is no question that he let
[15:19.400 --> 15:29.360]  three innocent men rot in a Boston jail in order to cover up FBI mafia informant sources
[15:29.360 --> 15:37.800]  in the whitey bulger matter, he had Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile on the FBI
[15:37.800 --> 15:47.720]  hook as an informant, which explains why Epstein was always able to escape more serious charges
[15:47.720 --> 15:49.720]  such as child trafficking.
[15:49.720 --> 15:55.840]  That's right, Robert Mueller is confirmed to be the main handler of the main child trafficking,
[15:55.840 --> 15:59.840]  you heard it here first, we'll be back.
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.840]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[16:04.840 --> 16:09.600]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood
[16:09.600 --> 16:14.520]  sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[16:14.520 --> 16:19.240]  that can alert you that something is wrong, hear how heart and body extract is making
[16:19.240 --> 16:24.600]  a difference in thousands of people's lives across America, my blood pressure has normalized,
[16:24.600 --> 16:29.160]  my diabetes has totally improved, everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look

[17:28.840 --> 17:31.000]  You have been lied to.
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.760]  My name is Kevin Ship, I'm a former decorated CIA officer, finally someone has come out
[17:36.760 --> 17:40.480]  and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[17:40.480 --> 17:45.480]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a
[17:45.480 --> 17:46.480]  shadow government.
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.280]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[17:49.280 --> 17:50.280]  are.
[17:50.280 --> 17:53.280]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church, to get
[17:53.280 --> 18:00.360]  them right now at killingunclesambook.com, killingunclesambook.com.
[18:00.360 --> 18:05.600]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing Pollen Block.
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.800]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.800 --> 18:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.840]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.840 --> 18:31.760]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.800]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.800 --> 18:37.800]  symptoms.
[18:37.800 --> 18:41.600]  Pollen Block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.600 --> 18:46.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.200]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.200 --> 18:54.880]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.880 --> 19:00.400]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[19:00.400 --> 19:04.760]  Pollen Wars Life is launching its newest product, we're really, really proud of it.
[19:04.760 --> 19:12.560]  It's a best-source, prebiotic fiber and it's got the very best concentrated fibers from
[19:12.560 --> 19:17.680]  berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your
[19:17.680 --> 19:20.200]  body and for regularity and so much more.
[19:20.200 --> 19:25.520]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live, active culture, floral life, as well
[19:25.520 --> 19:29.760]  as Myco ZX that targets the yeast, the mold and the funguses and the gut.
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.520]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these
[19:34.520 --> 19:35.520]  other products.

[19:38.960 --> 19:41.000]  quality products at the same time.

[19:43.680 --> 19:49.560]  Bodies sold out in a month, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we can come up with.
[19:49.560 --> 19:51.600]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[19:51.600 --> 19:54.960]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[19:54.960 --> 19:57.480]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[19:57.480 --> 20:03.040]  Get yours today in ForwardsLive.com.
[20:03.040 --> 20:13.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:13.520 --> 20:27.320]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.320 --> 20:36.120]  And here's President Trump two plus years ago, telling Jeb Bush, you better watch it
[20:36.120 --> 20:39.520]  buddy, after what you did standing down in Florida and after what your brother did in
[20:39.520 --> 20:41.040]  D.C.
[20:41.040 --> 20:44.760]  And now Trump is preparing to start releasing the fact that the deep state was complicit
[20:44.760 --> 20:48.240]  working with radical Islam to carry out 9-11.
[20:48.240 --> 20:49.920]  Here's the president.
[20:49.920 --> 20:55.560]  Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, all right?
[20:55.560 --> 21:00.960]  Now you can take it any way you want and it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the beginning
[21:00.960 --> 21:05.240]  of his announcement when he announced the president, took him five days, he went back.
[21:05.240 --> 21:06.240]  It was a mistake.
[21:06.240 --> 21:07.320]  It was a mistake.
[21:07.320 --> 21:12.840]  Took him five days before his people told him what to say and he ultimately said it was
[21:12.840 --> 21:13.840]  a mistake.
[21:13.840 --> 21:19.720]  The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, we don't even have it, Iran is taking
[21:19.720 --> 21:23.600]  over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[21:23.600 --> 21:24.600]  Obviously it was a mistake.
[21:24.600 --> 21:29.560]  So, George Bush made a mistake, we can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty.
[21:29.560 --> 21:31.520]  We should have never been in Iraq.
[21:31.520 --> 21:33.640]  We have destabilized the Middle East.
[21:33.640 --> 21:36.800]  But so you still think he should be in peace?
[21:36.800 --> 21:37.800]  I think it's my turn.
[21:37.800 --> 21:40.040]  You do whatever you want, you call it whatever you want.
[21:40.040 --> 21:41.640]  I want to tell you, they lied.
[21:41.640 --> 21:42.640]  Okay.
[21:42.640 --> 21:46.040]  They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none, and they knew there were
[21:46.040 --> 21:47.040]  none.
[21:47.040 --> 21:49.040]  There were no weapons of mass destruction.
[21:49.040 --> 21:51.040]  Okay, all right.
[21:51.040 --> 21:57.160]  And there's another clip too with him saying you screwed up on 9-11, you stood down in
[21:57.160 --> 22:01.200]  Florida, your brother stood down, you guys did a terrible job.
[22:01.200 --> 22:02.600]  We're going to get that clip for you as well.
[22:02.600 --> 22:06.400]  We've also got the clip coming out in the next segment where he talks about bombs in
[22:06.400 --> 22:07.400]  the buildings.
[22:07.400 --> 22:09.440]  So, again, this is really, really serious.
[22:09.440 --> 22:16.800]  The point is, Tucker Carlson has on some of the families where Mueller, on record, basically
[22:16.800 --> 22:22.320]  killed the investigation, didn't let them have the info to suit.
[22:22.320 --> 22:27.560]  And if you expand on that, we have the article on Infowars.com, Trump to go after Mueller
[22:27.560 --> 22:33.680]  for 9-11's Saudi cover-up, president about to drop the hammer on former FBI director
[22:33.680 --> 22:37.680]  for burying Saudi involvement in the attacks, as Roger Stone just mentioned.
[22:37.680 --> 22:40.200]  But this is coffin nails.
[22:40.200 --> 22:44.480]  This is kryptonite to the deep state, Roger, and again, the specific thing that I want
[22:44.480 --> 22:50.260]  to relay to everyone is, the exclusive here is, this is only the beginning of what Trump
[22:50.260 --> 22:52.480]  is going to start releasing.
[22:52.480 --> 22:56.120]  And he's the president, he has the right to declassify anything he wants, and he's letting
[22:56.120 --> 23:02.280]  them know, let's just say folks are letting them know that that's going on.
[23:02.280 --> 23:03.960]  So what does that signify?
[23:03.960 --> 23:08.720]  What do you make of this development that this is starting and that folks want the deep
[23:08.720 --> 23:10.200]  state to know we're coming for them?
[23:10.200 --> 23:17.400]  Well, I think the president is building the backfire necessary to terminate the partisan
[23:17.400 --> 23:20.840]  inquisition being led by Robert Mueller.
[23:20.840 --> 23:27.240]  I mean, that story in yesterday's of the day before his New York Times about Rod Rosenstein,
[23:27.240 --> 23:35.040]  who very clearly wrote a memo to the president advocating the firing of FBI director Comey,
[23:35.040 --> 23:37.640]  did not think it would be made public.
[23:37.640 --> 23:40.400]  Trump, as it is prerogative, made it public.
[23:40.400 --> 23:45.080]  This embarrassed Rosenstein in front of his deep state buddies, where he was trying to
[23:45.080 --> 23:52.280]  have it both ways, is furious at Trump, and his payback is the appointment of Robert Mueller.
[23:52.280 --> 23:54.560]  It is as clear as day.
[23:54.560 --> 23:56.440]  So he is acting in his self-interest.
[23:56.440 --> 24:01.600]  He has conflicts in that he has gotten his first job from Mueller.
[24:01.600 --> 24:07.480]  He has conflicts in that he approves the FISA warrant personally.
[24:07.480 --> 24:11.000]  He's conflicted, more conflicted in this case than Jeff Sessions is.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.720]  He needs to stand down or be terminated.
[24:14.720 --> 24:22.920]  So I think the president is laying the ground for the termination of what is a partisan
[24:22.920 --> 24:24.320]  witch hunt.
[24:24.320 --> 24:27.720]  People need to know more about Mr. Mueller.
[24:27.720 --> 24:34.320]  He is not the white knight that Lindsey Graham and others in the mainstream media have portrayed
[24:34.320 --> 24:40.800]  his role during and after the 9-11 matter needs to be examined.
[24:40.800 --> 24:47.040]  The fact that he is the man who mules the uranium specimens to Stockholm to close the
[24:47.040 --> 24:55.320]  deal for uranium-1 at behest of the Clintons shows that he is a bipartisan legman for the
[24:55.320 --> 24:56.320]  deep state.
[24:56.320 --> 25:03.800]  And he is complicit, therefore, in the largest treasonous financial crime in terms of dollars
[25:03.800 --> 25:05.960]  in American history.
[25:05.960 --> 25:10.640]  And it's attempting to overthrow a duly elected president when we have the FBI Justice Department
[25:10.640 --> 25:14.400]  conspiracy to keep him from getting elected, then try to stop him from getting in, they
[25:14.400 --> 25:18.120]  tried to not let the delegates be seated, then they've been waging war against him as
[25:18.120 --> 25:19.120]  whole family.
[25:19.120 --> 25:21.600]  You and I, Roger, I'll tell you, I called you last night about it.
[25:21.600 --> 25:26.800]  I've discovered whole new next level, Democratic Party has been caught red-handed in my personal
[25:26.800 --> 25:30.600]  life trying to actually wreck my family again.
[25:30.600 --> 25:32.640]  I mean, there is no end to these people.
[25:32.640 --> 25:33.640]  I've got to sue them now.
[25:33.640 --> 25:39.320]  They're just, they are so diabolical, they are so crazed, and then they use Alistair
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.680]  Crowley as the Democratic Party operating system?
[25:43.680 --> 25:47.720]  I mean, these people are beyond anything you could ever imagine.
[25:47.720 --> 25:53.600]  It is really, really extraordinary, but what tells me is Trump's taking the gloves off.
[25:53.600 --> 26:01.120]  For too long, the early Trump attorneys, a piece of legal advice was bend over and hand
[26:01.120 --> 26:07.320]  Robert Mueller the vacillate, turn over everything, waive all executive privilege, give Mueller
[26:07.320 --> 26:09.720]  millions and millions and millions of privilege.
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.520]  Make him God, let him violate all these laws.
[26:13.520 --> 26:20.720]  Right, ignore his use of material from FISA warrants, which is still the linchpin of
[26:20.720 --> 26:26.680]  this whole scandal, what Rosenstein struggles to cover up today, what is being used to harass
[26:26.680 --> 26:30.000]  me and Paul Manafort and others.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.080]  So this tells me Trump is going to war.
[26:33.080 --> 26:38.880]  It is essential, the American people know who and what Mr. Mueller is.
[26:38.880 --> 26:41.280]  It is not us claiming this.
[26:41.280 --> 26:47.160]  You can go online, look at the terrific story by Howie Carr about how Robert Mueller as
[26:47.160 --> 26:53.320]  U.S. attorney let three Italian men rot in a jail who he knew had nothing to do with
[26:53.320 --> 26:59.400]  a mob murder there in order to cover up for paid mafia informants who worked for Whitey
[26:59.400 --> 27:01.640]  Bolger.
[27:01.640 --> 27:04.080]  That's extraordinary.
[27:04.080 --> 27:07.680]  And now the president is telegraphing that he's going to start releasing the cover-up,
[27:07.680 --> 27:12.080]  the stand-down of 9-11 that implicates the Bushes, Mueller who ran the cover-up itself
[27:12.080 --> 27:17.000]  and the Clintons because we know Trump is really upset behind the scenes that it's the
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.760]  Bushes and their syndicate that are more effectively fighting his agenda than even the Democrats
[27:21.760 --> 27:22.760]  right now.
[27:22.760 --> 27:26.720]  And Chuck Todd now has come out and said President Trump is winning, Democrats reeling
[27:26.720 --> 27:27.920]  close quote.
[27:27.920 --> 27:30.720]  So Trump now knows who to target, doesn't he, Roger?
[27:30.720 --> 27:35.960]  Well, look, the poll that I would like to see, which nobody has taken, there is a new
[27:35.960 --> 27:41.640]  poll which shows the two top front runners of the Democratic Party, old, tired, sick
[27:41.640 --> 27:48.520]  and bereft of ideas but still just as greedy, Hillary Clinton, and Uncle Joe Biden, a man
[27:48.520 --> 27:54.760]  who is literally around the bend, a guy who keeps going around threatening physical violence
[27:54.760 --> 28:00.120]  against Donald Trump, when in fact, Trump's got 20 pounds on him, a much longer reach
[28:00.120 --> 28:06.040]  and in my opinion could put Joe out in one shot, one shot, just an opinion.
[28:06.040 --> 28:08.280]  So these are their nominees.
[28:08.280 --> 28:15.000]  I'd like to see them stacked in the legitimate poll, Trump versus Hillary, Trump versus Biden
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.480]  for 2020 and I think you'd find the president would crush both of them.
[28:19.480 --> 28:23.600]  If he ran against Hillary again tomorrow, he would crush her by a larger margin.
[28:23.600 --> 28:25.000]  And that's why Michael Moore panicked.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.440]  He went on Bill Maher this weekend and said, we've got to have an uprising, a million people
[28:28.440 --> 28:29.440]  surround the Capitol.
[28:29.440 --> 28:33.720]  Don't let the new Supreme Court pick in and he goes because Trump's going to win in 2020.
[28:33.720 --> 28:37.120]  They and America's coming back and they are crapping their britches.
[28:37.120 --> 28:39.200]  No, they're absolutely right.
[28:39.200 --> 28:44.520]  We need to have an uprising circle, their circle around the Capitol demanding a Supreme Court
[28:44.520 --> 28:49.760]  justice who believes in the rule of law, be there, surround their surrounding.
[28:49.760 --> 28:50.760]  That's my view.
[28:50.760 --> 28:53.720]  Well, let's do a few more minutes, I want to play this clip of Trump talking about 9-11
[28:53.720 --> 28:59.200]  and then ask you a few other key questions straight out with Roger Stone, I'm Alex Jones.
[28:59.200 --> 29:02.520]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[29:02.520 --> 29:07.480]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best, get a sunny bay heating pad.
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.560]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.
[29:12.560 --> 29:15.840]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny bay heating pad.
[29:15.840 --> 29:19.680]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways
[29:19.680 --> 29:22.240]  to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[29:22.240 --> 29:26.960]  Sunny Bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work
[29:26.960 --> 29:31.640]  and have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[29:31.640 --> 29:33.160]  Why take another pill?
[29:33.160 --> 29:37.400]  Many people use our sunny bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[29:37.400 --> 29:42.080]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[29:42.080 --> 29:45.120]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[29:45.120 --> 29:49.440]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce
[29:49.440 --> 29:50.520]  them to the public.
[29:50.520 --> 29:53.640]  You can easily find sunny bay heating pads on Amazon.
[29:53.640 --> 30:00.480]  Just go to amazon.com and search for sunny bay heating pads.
[30:00.480 --> 30:04.320]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[30:04.320 --> 30:07.200]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[30:07.200 --> 30:12.040]  That's why InfoWarsLife has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line, Super
[30:12.040 --> 30:14.200]  Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[33:03.960 --> 33:22.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.400 --> 33:26.840]  We're listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[33:26.840 --> 33:27.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:27.840 --> 33:28.840]  It wasn't architectural.
[33:28.840 --> 33:32.840]  In fact, the War Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building.
[33:32.840 --> 33:35.840]  Don't forget, that's at the big bomb in the basement.
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.840]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place because that's your foundation.
[33:39.840 --> 33:41.040]  And it withstood that.
[33:41.040 --> 33:45.520]  And I got to see that area about three or four days after it took place because one of my
[33:45.520 --> 33:50.040]  structural engineers actually took me for a tour because he did the building.
[33:50.040 --> 33:54.440]  And I said, I can't believe it, the building was standing solid and half of the columns
[33:54.440 --> 33:55.440]  were blown out.
[33:55.440 --> 33:58.440]  I mean, so this was an unbelievably powerful building.
[33:58.440 --> 34:02.160]  If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built
[34:02.160 --> 34:03.160]  from the outside, the steel.
[34:03.160 --> 34:07.920]  The reason the War Trade Center had such narrow windows is that in between all the windows
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.560]  you had the steel on the outside, the industry on the outside of the building.
[34:11.560 --> 34:15.840]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy eye beams, when I first looked
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.200]  at it, I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel.
[34:20.200 --> 34:24.200]  And this is steel that was, you remember the, the windows of the World Trade Center folks,
[34:24.200 --> 34:28.840]  I think you, you know, if you ever up there, they were quite narrow and in between was
[34:28.840 --> 34:29.840]  this heavy steel.
[34:29.840 --> 34:36.520]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been,
[34:36.520 --> 34:38.520]  how could it possibly go through the steel?
[34:38.520 --> 34:42.320]  I happened to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded
[34:42.320 --> 34:43.320]  almost simultaneously.
[34:43.320 --> 34:48.800]  Because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[34:48.800 --> 34:50.200]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[34:50.200 --> 34:52.200]  The World Trade Center came down during the brother's reign.
[34:52.200 --> 34:53.200]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[34:53.200 --> 34:54.200]  Remember that.
[34:54.200 --> 34:55.200]  Hold on.
[34:55.200 --> 34:56.200]  Let me finish this.
[34:56.200 --> 34:57.960]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[34:57.960 --> 34:58.960]  That's not keeping us safe.
[34:58.960 --> 35:02.600]  Look, I won the lottery when I was born, 63 years ago, and looked up and I saw my mom
[35:02.600 --> 35:03.600]  mom.
[35:03.600 --> 35:04.920]  My mom is the strongest woman I know.
[35:04.920 --> 35:05.920]  She should be running.
[35:05.920 --> 35:08.320]  This is not about my family or his family.
[35:08.320 --> 35:09.320]  Okay.
[35:09.320 --> 35:13.400]  I'm putting a bookend on that, but there's Trump saying, and he owns a bunch of buildings,
[35:13.400 --> 35:16.160]  the area, and he talked to the structural engineer, and he's telling you, I think there
[35:16.160 --> 35:17.160]  were bombs in there.
[35:17.160 --> 35:22.080]  Well, we have the local news with them removing bombs, reporting their bombs in the buildings,
[35:22.080 --> 35:24.720]  bombs in building seven, not hit by an airplane.
[35:24.720 --> 35:25.720]  Trump knows it all.
[35:25.720 --> 35:28.320]  He's getting ready to bring it all out.
[35:28.320 --> 35:34.800]  Now, Seg Wing, talking to Roger during the break, he's got a big announcement to make
[35:34.800 --> 35:40.200]  to everybody here about what Trump has decided to do and why we see Kelly heading for the
[35:40.200 --> 35:41.200]  exits.
[35:41.200 --> 35:43.480]  Reportedly, he'll be gone July 31st.
[35:43.480 --> 35:47.680]  Roger Stone, explain what Trump's decided to do for everybody out there.
[35:47.680 --> 35:52.280]  Well, first of all, there's so much going on.
[35:52.280 --> 35:58.040]  I'd point out that my book, The Bush Crime Family, came out 11 days before that debate
[35:58.040 --> 36:02.600]  in which Trump confronted Jeb about his stand down on 9-11.
[36:02.600 --> 36:05.920]  Now it will all come out.
[36:05.920 --> 36:14.760]  It is very important to note that one of those judges, Brett Kavanaugh, a Bush family favorite
[36:14.760 --> 36:20.040]  who seems to be among the front runners for the Supreme Court, has a minor problem.
[36:20.040 --> 36:24.920]  He is involved in the cover-up of the Vince Foster death.
[36:24.920 --> 36:31.160]  Now, while it has never been established as to whether Foster, a top aide to Bill and
[36:31.160 --> 36:37.640]  Hillary Clinton, the keeper of all their secrets, murdered himself, suicide or was murdered,
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.040]  I tend to believe that he actually did commit suicide.
[36:42.040 --> 36:49.600]  However, his body was moved by Hillary Clinton and two of her henchmen to Fort Marcy Park.
[36:49.600 --> 36:55.160]  A man named Patrick Nolten, just an honest citizen, was in the wrong place at the wrong
[36:55.160 --> 37:02.680]  time and saw things he shouldn't have seen pertaining to the dumping of Foster's body.
[37:02.680 --> 37:10.280]  And he was harassed by Special Counsel Brett Kavanaugh, a clean-up man for the Clintons
[37:10.280 --> 37:17.840]  in shutting down the investigation into how Vince Foster's body got to Fort Marcy Park.
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.160]  So we definitely don't want him, and we also know that Paul Tonic will be in the running.
[37:21.160 --> 37:28.040]  We also have this lady who is a Christian, that's Amy Connie Barrett, what do you think
[37:28.040 --> 37:29.040]  of her?
[37:29.040 --> 37:35.880]  Well, she is a stout Catholic, I'm worried about her not being as libertarian as perhaps
[37:35.880 --> 37:36.880]  I'd like.
[37:36.880 --> 37:41.160]  I'd like to see a libertarian on the judge, on the court to balance the conservatives
[37:41.160 --> 37:42.160]  out.
[37:42.160 --> 37:44.400]  Judge Willett from Texas would be excellent.
[37:44.400 --> 37:50.000]  I'm coming to the conclusion that the president has come to the conclusion that although not
[37:50.000 --> 37:57.640]  Paul Tonic is his emotional favorite, at his age he is probably too old for this appointment.
[37:57.640 --> 38:05.160]  And there's now a discussion about the judge re-affirming back as U.S. Attorney General,
[38:05.160 --> 38:06.680]  an interesting concept.
[38:06.680 --> 38:13.240]  Ooh, Attorney General, that's right, because that's a two-to-four year post instead of,
[38:13.240 --> 38:16.320]  we want somebody young, that's why this lady would be great.
[38:16.320 --> 38:23.680]  Even Napolitano is younger and more vigorous than Jeff Sessions, yet we get a younger jurist.
[38:23.680 --> 38:25.480]  I really worried.
[38:25.480 --> 38:32.640]  Kavanaugh is a Bush Republican in wolf's clothing, in sheep's clothing, his involvement
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.480]  with Vince Foster alone, his witness tampering on behalf of the deep state.
[38:37.480 --> 38:43.160]  These matters should eliminate him, but it's important that employers not allow him to
[38:43.160 --> 38:46.480]  oppose as just a solid conservative.
[38:46.480 --> 38:50.800]  Now, in your own words, what you said to me during the break when I told you about my
[38:50.800 --> 38:55.960]  conversation last night, and we also talked last night, you said Trump has decided to,
[38:55.960 --> 38:57.480]  in your own words.
[38:57.480 --> 38:59.560]  Take the gloves off.
[38:59.560 --> 39:01.080]  I think he's going on offense.
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.000]  I think, look, the two Bloomberg stories this week, I think, told the story.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.040]  You said Trump's going to war.
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.000]  He's going to war, because the story that says now that the, now Robert Mueller, according
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  to Bloomberg, will focus on Russian collusion.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  Pardon me?
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.360]  He's had two years and spent $17 million.
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.160]  I thought that was what he was focused on.
[39:24.160 --> 39:29.200]  He's turned up nothing, but this one case is turning out to be an embarrassment to him,
[39:29.200 --> 39:35.280]  the 13 Russians that he can't convict and who are demanding discovery.
[39:35.280 --> 39:41.600]  He has, he has, then in a second story, said he will make decisions about charges against
[39:41.600 --> 39:50.480]  the president, which would have to be included in his final report in the fall, in October.
[39:50.480 --> 39:51.480]  Get it, Alex?
[39:51.480 --> 39:55.760]  October, just before the election, October.
[39:55.760 --> 39:58.160]  So their game plan is clear.
[39:58.160 --> 40:01.600]  Anyone who thinks this guy is giving up is wrong.
[40:01.600 --> 40:05.240]  He is a, he is a deep state hit man on a mission.
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.080]  I am being persecuted specifically because of my role in exposing the corruption of Bill
[40:10.080 --> 40:15.760]  and Hillary Clinton and the Clinton's war on women and the crimes of the Bushes.
[40:15.760 --> 40:22.560]  It's a two-party vendetta to get me because of my support for Donald Trump.
[40:22.560 --> 40:24.320]  That's why I'm being harassed.
[40:24.320 --> 40:29.200]  That's why my Fourth Amendments are being violated as they interrogate.
[40:29.200 --> 40:33.280]  You've been banned off Twitter, they've, they admittedly have hacked into your emails.
[40:33.280 --> 40:36.280]  Now Skype says you've been banned.
[40:36.280 --> 40:40.320]  The U.S. Senate wants every email between Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.920]  That's something they've specifically asked for.
[40:42.920 --> 40:43.920]  And they shall have.
[40:43.920 --> 40:46.440]  It is all benign.
[40:46.440 --> 40:47.920]  You'll find no Russian meddling.
[40:47.920 --> 40:50.880]  You'll find a lot of truth telling.
[40:50.880 --> 40:54.840]  And we'll find like, here's your plane tickets or, you know, here's that, but it's such a
[40:54.840 --> 40:55.840]  violation.
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.560]  Like what's the, what's the name of that great barbecue place again that we're going to?
[40:59.560 --> 41:00.560]  That kind of thing.
[41:00.560 --> 41:02.040]  That's actually what's in there.
[41:02.040 --> 41:03.040]  Yeah.
[41:03.040 --> 41:04.040]  Oh my gosh.
[41:04.040 --> 41:05.040]  All right, Roger.
[41:05.040 --> 41:06.400]  Thank you so much.
[41:06.400 --> 41:07.400]  Have a great Fourth of July.
[41:07.400 --> 41:08.400]  Trump is going to war.
[41:08.400 --> 41:09.400]  We're all in a war.
[41:09.400 --> 41:10.400]  God bless you.
[41:10.400 --> 41:18.880]  Very special, special news at the war room tonight, assuming that we can solve our problem
[41:18.880 --> 41:19.880]  with Skype.
[41:19.880 --> 41:25.320]  It's extraordinary the extent to which the deep state and the tech left is going to harass
[41:25.320 --> 41:26.320]  me.
[41:26.320 --> 41:30.960]  Alex, all of my Skype platforms closed down today without explanation, which is why I reach
[41:30.960 --> 41:32.760]  you by phone.
[41:32.760 --> 41:37.920]  There is, uh, is manipulating the algorithms at the Stone Cold Truth Facebook page and
[41:37.920 --> 41:39.880]  my personal Facebook page.
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.840]  I, I, I post brilliant and I get back free reposts.
[41:43.840 --> 41:46.080]  Well, I mean, we have the internal documents.
[41:46.080 --> 41:48.080]  They're doing this to everybody who's effective.
[41:48.080 --> 41:51.840]  That's why everybody's got to work even harder to buy word of mouth, spread the word about
[41:51.840 --> 41:55.160]  info wars.com, news wars.com, Stone Cold Truth.com.
[41:55.160 --> 42:00.040]  Roger, have a great fourth and we'll see you tonight on the war room one way or another.
[42:00.040 --> 42:01.040]  Most excellent.
[42:01.040 --> 42:02.040]  Many thanks, Alex.
[42:02.040 --> 42:06.560]  Now, when we come back, Paul wrote a great article with the inside intel.

[42:14.840 --> 42:16.640]  This, this is huge.
[42:16.640 --> 42:22.160]  Trump threatens to release 9 11 docs implicating Clintons on the bushes.
[42:22.160 --> 42:24.480]  Trump sends warning to deep state.
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.200]  We should probably just add Mueller, Clinton's bushes and their minion Mueller.
[42:29.200 --> 42:30.760]  This is huge.
[42:30.760 --> 42:32.400]  It's up on info wars.com.
[42:32.400 --> 42:33.800]  So get that out to everybody.
[42:33.800 --> 42:35.560]  Now we're going to go to break.

[42:40.980 --> 42:43.320]  graffiti message.
[42:43.320 --> 42:48.560]  More Republicans confronted and you've got more people being arrested for threatening
[42:48.560 --> 42:50.040]  to kill Rand Paul.
[42:50.040 --> 42:51.040]  Goodness gracious.
[42:51.040 --> 42:52.720]  Think about Rand Paul's got there.
[42:52.720 --> 42:57.640]  He's been shot at a bunch of his ribs broken physically attacked.

[46:06.040 --> 46:07.040]  holding.
[46:07.040 --> 46:12.200]  Hey Alex mate, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now, I remember back
[46:12.200 --> 46:17.600]  when info wars and prison planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.440]  down the page on my dial up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the
[46:21.440 --> 46:25.960]  books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your product
[46:25.960 --> 46:31.040]  since the birth iteration of survival shield and since then I'm on the X2, the super male
[46:31.040 --> 46:36.480]  vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX body, it's all amazing.
[46:36.480 --> 46:37.480]  Thank you brother.
[46:37.480 --> 46:41.960]  Yeah and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[46:41.960 --> 46:46.360]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more
[46:46.360 --> 46:51.520]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.760]  it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776
[46:56.760 --> 46:59.760]  worldwide.
[46:59.760 --> 47:29.160]  We're back live broadcasting worldwide, I'm your host Alex Jones and I want to open the
[47:29.160 --> 47:33.960]  phones up coming up in the next hour to discuss all the amazing things that are happening.
[47:33.960 --> 47:42.280]  Then we have several guests joining us who were inside of the riot that the Antifa Democrat
[47:42.280 --> 47:47.840]  globalist operative started in Portland over the weekend and even local newspapers admitted
[47:47.840 --> 47:58.280]  the riot started when Antifa started throwing bricks, bottles and fireworks at the crowd
[47:58.280 --> 48:03.680]  and I've seen these explosives, what they're doing is the mortars that you can shoot out
[48:03.680 --> 48:09.360]  of the big tubes are like hand grenades, in fact they are if you put shrapnel around
[48:09.360 --> 48:15.240]  them, I don't want to give Antifa any ideas, but they blow people's hands off all the time.
[48:15.240 --> 48:19.720]  The mortars go boom and then shoot out of the tube and they have a lot of explosive power
[48:19.720 --> 48:29.160]  to create that huge blue flash, white flash, red flash that you see and even in China where
[48:29.160 --> 48:31.880]  they're not allowed to have firearms and stuff, when you hear about the revolts that happen
[48:31.880 --> 48:36.920]  against the government, people steal the fireworks out of the facilities and use those as weapons
[48:36.920 --> 48:41.680]  and they are bombs and if you watch some of these, these are not normal firecrackers or
[48:41.680 --> 48:51.800]  cherry bombs that are going off M80s, you can see that they are basically throwing larger
[48:51.800 --> 48:56.200]  fireworks at them that are very, very dangerous and you see the phosphorus shooting out, you
[48:56.200 --> 49:02.020]  name it, if somebody tries to throw one of those at you, it's my view that's an extremely
[49:02.020 --> 49:09.080]  deadly weapon and I guarantee you if the police see somebody holding a mortar, lighting it
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.960]  and then throwing it, you have no choice but to take those people out.
[49:13.960 --> 49:19.800]  This is just becoming outrageously insane, so those are not M80s like the news said
[49:19.800 --> 49:27.120]  they're throwing at them, they are mortars that appear to have had the propulsion piece
[49:27.120 --> 49:33.920]  cut off on the back and have been directly wired in with a fuse, so let me tell you,
[49:33.920 --> 49:38.640]  that's what I do for fun back when I was a teenager and stuff, my dad showed me how to
[49:38.640 --> 49:44.800]  put a rock on one and then light it, wait until it got down far enough so that it didn't
[49:44.800 --> 49:48.960]  go out in the water and then drop it into a pond or something and see a couple fish
[49:48.960 --> 49:53.040]  float up, back when he was a kid they had dynamite at the ranch to blow up stumps and
[49:53.040 --> 49:58.320]  stuff, the tractors couldn't pull out, his dad still had a box of dynamite in the truck
[49:58.320 --> 50:03.000]  but he also worked in highway construction and stuff as a part-time job, back when I
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.960]  was a little kid so he was a highway engineer, so that's why he had dynamite but nowadays
[50:07.960 --> 50:11.200]  you can't trust Americans with dynamite, you know, you should never have any attacks
[50:11.200 --> 50:14.640]  with explosives and once they make the explosives illegal then suddenly only the criminals have
[50:14.640 --> 50:20.320]  them but I'm digressing off into what happened there, that's coming up in the third hour,
[50:20.320 --> 50:25.120]  I've got a reset, there's so much news here, I don't even know where to start, we've got
[50:25.120 --> 50:30.360]  a lot of good news, a lot of bad news, a lot of insane news, a lot of crazy news, I cannot
[50:30.360 --> 50:39.640]  express to you how big this is that Trump is getting ready to start the 9-11 drumbeat
[50:39.640 --> 50:44.480]  and bring out what really happened on 9-11, that is the thinking behind Tucker Carlson
[50:44.480 --> 50:49.480]  having the guests on, the whole 9-11 situation, the families, Mueller ordering that the investigation
[50:49.480 --> 50:53.880]  be shut down, that the FBI not give that to them in their lawsuit, that's already on record,
[50:53.880 --> 50:59.920]  it's been reported on by mainstream news but I've been told that Trump is beginning to
[50:59.920 --> 51:06.440]  then bring it all out using this show and they want you to know that, they want Mueller
[51:06.440 --> 51:12.640]  and all you arrogant SOBs to know that it's all coming out, Epstein and how you had him
[51:12.640 --> 51:16.320]  as a confidential informant for years while he was loading little girls on airplanes to
[51:16.320 --> 51:20.600]  take her to be raped by a bunch of perverts on his island, that's all confirmed and Mueller
[51:20.600 --> 51:25.240]  just like Whitey Bolger could kill whoever he wanted, killed reportedly over 100 people,
[51:25.240 --> 51:30.960]  run mafia operations in Boston, assassinate members of other mafias that the FBI wanted
[51:30.960 --> 51:38.720]  taken out, the FBI was operating as a gang in Boston and it wasn't just a few guys that
[51:38.720 --> 51:44.520]  were involved, that's all confirmed and Mueller ran the cover up and tried to frame the Italian
[51:44.520 --> 51:53.760]  mafia for it, it's unbelievable ladies and gentlemen and what the sex offender Epstein
[51:53.760 --> 51:57.600]  only got like a year for all the stuff he did, 18 months, served like a year of it,
[51:57.600 --> 52:02.720]  he served 13 months of 18 months, I remember he said 12, it was 13 months, I mean ladies
[52:02.720 --> 52:06.440]  and gentlemen this is the guy with 20 plus flights with Bill Clinton, this is the guy
[52:06.440 --> 52:11.000]  flying to the Sheik's Islands that are known to have sex slaves, it's been confirmed, Robert
[52:11.000 --> 52:19.480]  Mueller is a nightmarish demon of the Clintons and the Bushes who used all of that information
[52:19.480 --> 52:23.040]  that they garnered with public officials and people going to have sex with 13 12 year old
[52:23.040 --> 52:28.680]  girls to burn everybody and he's a monster, people are like well you better watch out
[52:28.680 --> 52:34.440]  Mueller's a criminal, I know he's a criminal, I know all about how he operates, man somebody's
[52:34.440 --> 52:38.920]  got to take these guys on, I don't want to hear it, well you're defiling the FBI, he's
[52:38.920 --> 52:47.600]  not the FBI, he's a disgusting nightmare creature and he's going down, Mueller will never politically
[52:47.600 --> 52:51.960]  survive what he's done, he'll never bring down Trump, he'll bring nothing down, he is
[52:51.960 --> 52:59.080]  a loser but an arrogant creature for decades operating and getting away with crime after
[52:59.080 --> 53:07.040]  crime, after crime, after crime, against children, against women, against humanity and all the
[53:07.040 --> 53:12.160]  innocent people that Whitey Bulger killed, just choking to death, young women for no
[53:12.160 --> 53:16.560]  reason because they heard something, just a lot of really evil stuff, that's where
[53:16.560 --> 53:22.720]  he comes from, that's what Mueller's into, he's a thug, he's a gangster but now he's
[53:22.720 --> 53:28.000]  up against history and now he's going to lose, so that's coming up, we're going to get into
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.760]  ICE throwing bricks through the window and then assaulting people and calling for all
[53:33.760 --> 53:38.160]  of it and I've got a lot of good news I'm going to get to that I mentioned as well, we've
[53:38.160 --> 53:44.960]  got Bono warning that the whole global government is collapsing, Venezuela further protests

[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:32.360]  to do this this is where they're saying use the 25th amendment to remove the president
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:39.080]  during the crisis uh extra judicially all of it and so then i saw george soros's media
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:45.560]  matters and cnn all make me the main enemy and i had a big audience and we were important
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.920]  but not that important as soon as i began to beat the drum and go look they're calling
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.120]  for martial law they're calling for civil unrest they're calling for a civil war they went crazy
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:01.400]  and would say jones is lying no one called for that even though i'd show you dozens of
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:07.360]  articles and i'd show you internal emails that had gotten leaked the democrats talk
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.880]  of their constituents and their fundraisers uh their donors saying don't worry we're gonna
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:17.400]  launch a civil war because they didn't want us to get the jump on them what they were
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.240]  planning if we're launching a sneak attack you don't want it out there but now in the
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:30.840]  middle of 2018 already into july hard to believe people are like oh alex you're really telling

[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.720]  this i will bill let me tell you something this judge goes through for the rest of at least
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:14.120]  while all of our lives it's a right no no that's it it's over combined with the white house and
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:20.440]  the congress well yeah well yes and if this is the last american president how does you know i told
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:26.520]  you i'm not that smart they they talk about this in their elite publications and then they develop
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:36.920]  the plan they then beta test it with some feelers in the media 13 14 months ago unfortunately uh
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:42.920]  we've got a situation where uh you know we've got a a misogynist you know in the white house we've
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.720]  got a racist who's also anti-semitic and i know people don't like to you know hear those terms
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:53.640]  is he really anti-semitic where did you pick that up well yeah yeah yeah yeah and i'll tell you why
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:04:01.640]  i'm gonna tell you why because it doesn't matter whether you are uh a discriminating against a
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:08.200]  black person or a muslim or a latino or a jew if you are comfortable with the fact that there are
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:14.680]  groups who hate muslims hate jews hate latinos hate with if you are comfortable with having
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:22.120]  those groups support you and you don't in a forceful way say this is not part of who i am he's done
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:28.920]  that you lying race baiting racist pig it's very disturbing to think that the first african-american
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.400]  president ronnie works for soros that by someone who's of course uh actually helped round up jews
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.760]  for the ghettos but in a way i understand it because we're fighting the last battle because
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:44.280]  you're a disgusting race-baiting pig globalism has been about selling america out and if you
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:49.800]  look at all the preparations of antifa funded by soros and the fort foundation and others if
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:54.920]  you look at everything they're doing these guys have overthrown ukraine and caused the civil war

[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:11.400]  of what you're doing and we're coming for you so damn the maneuvers go straight at them
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:17.080]  let's start this hour with some good news the democrats the globalists in every one of their
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.840]  internal publications are running up the white flag admitting that they're losing
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:29.320]  and they're very upset that the economy and positive thinking and belief in the family is
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:34.840]  starting to have a little bit of a resurgence because they know like fire that will spread
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:40.040]  burning down their tyranny it will bring satisfaction it will bring bring normalcy it
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:47.320]  will bring productivity it will bring happiness the globalists and their corporate disease is
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:53.240]  designed mental illness to destabilize and control society here's just one of the clips
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:08:01.640]  chuck todd the obama clinton operative admits president trump winning democrats reeling here it is
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:06.760]  announced retirement of supreme court justice anthony kennedy this week helped make one
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.960]  political reality clear despite his overall unpopularity president trump is winning and
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:17.240]  the democrats right now are reeling the supreme court mr trump is about to shape the court for
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:21.640]  a generation by choosing a possible tie-breaking conservative justice and he's already filled
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.360]  the lower courts with like-minded conservatives how about the republican party the president's
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.800]  approval rating among republicans is around 90% elected republicans fear criticizing him
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:38.280]  fear criticizing him and the party has become a cult of personality is how about fake news
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.320]  mr trump has turned that phrase which initially referred to the phony russian-generated stories
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:49.240]  designed to support his campaign in 2016 and to an applause line now to discredit responsible
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.880]  reporting showcasing his misdeeds how about credibility here for reporters faithfully
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.800]  fact-checked the president's serial misstatements they were being considered biased if they
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.880]  don't have a misstatement stain track i was gonna do it at the end but there's just too many lies i mean
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:06.920]  did you did you catch out they'll tell the truth but the sort of lie despite trump's overall
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:13.480]  unfavorability even in their fake gallant polls and others that add 15 points more of democrats
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:21.560]  he's at 50% so that's not the majority being negative and they're also calling people and
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:27.240]  sampling mainly democrat areas on record to create that illusion with all these little
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:32.760]  followers out there that are mad and then he goes on to say oh despite fake news initially
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.880]  being to expose russian bots well it turns out 80% of those russian bots just some company that got
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:44.600]  hired in russia were for hillary and again it goes on and on and on and on so he tells the
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:50.440]  truth overall that trumps winning but inserts lies after lie after lie after lie the truth is the
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.280]  economy's coming back the truth is trumps hitting on all cylinders the truth is you've been caught
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:10:01.000]  with your russia gate thing being a whole hoax you know i saw bill clinton on one of those comedy
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.600]  central shows last week i meant to play it making pulp the headline it was uh i think trevor know
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:12.200]  is the guy's name and he's on there going i tell you i think sarah hookaby sanders was really nice
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.520]  how she paid for her meal she left when she was told to that's a good thing that makes him sound
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:21.400]  like a southern gentleman but he goes you know that bile that poison's going to come back
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.720]  that trumps vomiting saying all mexicans are criminals and scum and he hates them well when
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:29.560]  you say all the mexicans are scum and criminals and you hate them some of that's going to come
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:35.800]  back on your people so you know he caused that trump never said mexicans are scum or all criminals
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.720]  are bad just total lie but let me just say i'm a gentleman sarah hookaby sanders i don't condemn
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.960]  kicking around the restaurant by the way i'm just saying she politely even paid for her meal
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:53.240]  and she left that's good get your ass out of here but the point is you deserve it because
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:58.040]  of the poison that trump spewed out some of that poison's going to come back up that's the quote
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:03.880]  some of that poison's going to come back up on you see but trump didn't say that but see
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:10.040]  but i think it sounds like he's being congenial and a nice headline oh look i don't like what
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.640]  happened to her well that's the actually she did deserve it but that's how i do it that's how i
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.800]  write the things around here it's really nice to be able to lie to people like that let's go back to
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:26.200]  old toddy here he is either way mr trump wins the Mueller investigation the president has succeeded
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.760]  in convincing millions that the investigation is biased despite trafficking only an innuendo
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:36.360]  they're causing it oh trafficking owned back it up 20 seconds trafficking only an innuendo because
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.640]  chuck todd reading off the teleprompter said so they've caught him in the straw emails the page
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.360]  emails the mckabe emails we got to keep him from getting in we're going to stop him we're going to
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:51.480]  fix it insurance policies millions of dollars for the fake fusion gps Mueller breaking all the rules
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:57.960]  the thing going on and on rosenstein controlling the old ill comey and strach covering up for hillary
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:05.720]  on the server gate and Benghazi and russia gate but meanwhile chuck todd says oh he's he's succeeded
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:13.880]  in despite the factors no evidence anybody colluded to frame him that we did no you've
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:21.560]  been caught red-handed continue mr trump wins the Mueller investigation the president has succeeded
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:26.200]  in convincing millions that the investigation is biased despite trafficking only an innuendo
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:30.360]  and not providing evidence then there's the economy it is doing well but it was doing well
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.240]  before he took off hey pause uh no it was slowing before and now we've got thousands of new factories
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.960]  coming in and exuberance is up and they said it would never be above three percent and it's basically
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.000]  about to be announced at four percent on on and on so see that was all obama did that who said he'd
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  never get above three percent what's he have a magic wand yeah there's a magic wand hoping we're
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.040]  stupid hoping we're gullible here it is it was doing well before he took office yet with unemployment
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:01.560]  down and jobs being created president trump is getting this credit still much of mr trump's success
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.800]  is superficial while he's more popular among republicans the party overall is shrinking
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.680]  his trade war north korea a war the Mueller investigation all could turn against him and
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.040]  frankly could turn against him now like north korea has and they're cheerleading that north korea
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:21.320]  hasn't done everything it said it would do but they never even agreed on the new timetable
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.800]  and so Pompeo is rushing out there we're trying to take north korea away from china they're putting
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.280]  pressure on them this is a real tug of war to get them to come out of the dark china's been keeping
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.840]  them in that bad position that's coming up later i'm gonna break that down but trumps trying to go
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:41.400]  get peace trumps trying to fix things something you guys never did and then chuck todd sits up there
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:47.240]  bad mouthing everything it's incredible meanwhile uh no the republican party's growing it's populace
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:52.920]  we're taking it over it's getting more gubernatorial seats more statehouse seats more federal seats
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:14:01.960]  the democratic party is a is a bizarro uh elitist coastal party uh that its only hope is to bring
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:10.120]  in dumbed down third world populations uh that are on their payroll so again that's just chuck
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:14.920]  todd trying to hold the line hold the forces during collapse make everybody think that they've
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.920]  got a shot from coming back from the dead and betting against the u.s economy saying it could
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:23.320]  turn it could turn any moment it's superficial america isn't strong by the way i'm chuck todd i
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.960]  love america remember seeing in we don't hate america we love america we don't hate americans

[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:03.640]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.680]  in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:15.720]  concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:21.720]  could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:27.640]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.520]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water a lot of poison next we tested the water
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:38.360]  from our lexapur gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:45.560]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the lexapur raises
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:51.480]  the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:57.080]  rain water supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:13.000]  a lot of the supporters believe that we are the enemy of the american people and that is
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.600]  really really an awful situation we are not the enemy of the american people we love the american
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:38.360]  people we are not the enemy of the american people we love the american people we love the american
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:49.320]  people they came in peace
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:21:03.320]  we are not the enemy of the american people we love the american people
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:08.280]  this is cnn
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.280]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:25.320]  a lot of poison has been poured down america's throat uh since that 2016 campaign started calling
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:30.360]  the me started off calling mexicans rapists and murderers so it's hard to pour poison down other
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.960]  people's throat and not have some of it come back up and bubble up
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.360]  incredible isn't it
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:50.760]  now shifting gears maxine waters has raised the battle cry michael moors raised the battle cry
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:58.120]  you've got all these people getting arrested for going out and saying kill rand paul murderous
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:03.000]  children murderous wife rub their intestines all over the walls and a helter skelter type killing
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:08.440]  that's all coming up in this segment we're breaking it down but i thought we'd kick it off first with
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.720]  a reminder of mad maxine in her latest uh speech says we are sick and tired of trump
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:19.720]  he's been there too long in peach 45 yeah because you didn't like the election you don't like the
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:25.560]  economy coming back that your boot on our necks being removed and you can see your corrupt power
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:34.760]  dwayning and your party disappearing and that's what's happening you can see all of it disappearing
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:41.480]  you can see it running through at your fingers so here he is mad max i am not about to let this
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:48.840]  country go by the way of donald trump we are sick and tired of him he's been there too long
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:23:02.120]  they dare me to say impeach him today i say impeach 45 today i say donald trump trump
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:07.560]  this is not your country to do with whatever you want to do this country belongs to all of us
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:15.000]  and the supreme court upheld five countries that don't even have working airports where the
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.600]  imams give them passports and then occasional charter flights fly out and then unvetted people
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:29.800]  from libya somalia sudan where they sell humans in slave markets where women unattended are kidnapped
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:39.960]  in minutes and gang raped and then she's calling that bad just like bill clinton says that trump
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:45.240]  says he hates mexicans and that you know and that mexicans are criminals no he said we have an open
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:50.440]  border with a lot of criminals pouring across back and forth it's dangerous so again they just regurgitate
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:56.280]  that lie over and over again uh let's go ahead uh go to the scott prouitt becomes latest trump
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:01.800]  official to be harassed at a restaurant with the fake sanctimonious you know angry woman with her
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:07.880]  kid in his face like he's done something bad then we've got abolished ice vandals throw brick
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:15.640]  through window of g.o.p. office leave graffiti message uh here is the latest video uh we deserve
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:20.680]  to have somebody who actually does protect our environment and somebody who believes in climate
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:26.440]  change and keeps it seriously for the benefit of all of us including our children um so i would urge
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:35.320]  you to resign before your scandals push you out so there you go again america's having its carbon
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.720]  cut off to bankrupt as china has no carbon restrictions either this india or mexico this is
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:45.160]  an admitted plan to bankrupt us and pay al gore uh the roth child's and soros trillions of dollars
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:50.440]  if they ever got their carbon tax but that's going up in flame as well there's the nebraska republican
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:57.400]  party had the old brick thrown through abolish ice and that's the democrats big mantra now
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:04.840]  meanwhile we have jennifer rubin says sarah sanders needs a life sentence of being made uncomfortable
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.360]  well you know what's going to happen in major studies it varies from country to country but
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.480]  it's normally six times more likely to steal nine times more likely not to give to charity
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.200]  just type in liberals are more mentally ill liberals are more psychotic liberals are less
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:26.440]  likely to give to charity liberals are less likely to uh uh keep a job liberals are more
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:32.040]  likely to steal there are studies in canada australia corporations all know this their
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:38.840]  virtues signaling snot knows control freaks who live to rule everyone else and get in everyone
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:45.480]  else's business that's what they do and most your psychologists in this country now are democrat
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.720]  priesthood who just replace confession and all they do is work around the clock to break up families
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:57.480]  and destroy this country in many cases it's unbelievable it's not in all cases but that's
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.280]  what's going on and it's being exposed people are figuring out that there is a cult of control
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:06.760]  freaks i've done a survey and looked at it and you know what the most pop they got tv shows about
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:13.240]  it now the most popular thing with the average democrat now is allister krally and you look at
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:19.160]  the wiki leaks and you look at the podestas and you look at revamovich and all these people is they
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:26.360]  are into the occult they are little magic thinking harry potter fans and they graduate to allister
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:32.120]  krally and they are falling apart they are losers they are failures looking for power instead of
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.800]  just being good and realizing god's there and that is the power and that you were already ascended
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:44.520]  if you love god but instead they always dine a big pile of their own feces and total failure like
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:50.600]  allister krally and other delusional fruit bowl so let's continue with jennifer rubin here it is
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:57.880]  what's most successful is getting a million people on the street to protest you know back that up
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.920]  notice that's the new talking point from bill mar from michael moore million people million people
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:08.200]  surround surround surround surround and that had the provocateurs start the fires start the uprising
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.360]  start the this and that try to get the black community out to burn everything down that's
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.920]  their plan the left in their own documents say we don't do it we wear mask the white people
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:20.520]  the professors they go out and burn some stuff get it started and then hope they can get black
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.400]  folks too that's in the documents that are up on in full wars dot com let's continue but what's most
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:31.880]  successful is getting a million people on the street to protest yeah so let's redirect all of
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:37.160]  that good pent up energy to something that makes a difference let's get a million people to go to
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:43.080]  main or a million people to go to alaska and start putting pressure on the senators yeah so it's
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.960]  perfectly civil to do that no one's telling them to be violent protesters but we're not going to
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:53.960]  let these people go through life unscathed sarah huckabee has no right to live a life of no fuss no
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:59.720]  must after lying to the press after inciting against the press these people should be made
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:05.800]  uncomfortable and i think that's a life sentence frankly and look how mentally ill all those democrats
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.200]  look look if you're watching on tv they're they're kind of all looking off the distance they always
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:16.200]  are they got ticks they're all just they're weak stupid people and they've been bred and contained
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:23.000]  and and and put up on pedestals and given their their participation trophies and now they are at
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.760]  war with prosperity and capitalism and they are the biggest dupes of the megabanks and the trillion
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:33.560]  air companies and the people worth hundreds of billions that pay no tax that literally fund them
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.920]  and then run slave factories with suicide nets and forced abortion in china and then they point
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.640]  their finger at trump and say he has no right to exist how dare him what he's doing to america

[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:21.000]  long mustache it's 12 o'clock americans another day closer to victory and for all of you out there on
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:31.880]  a behind the lines this is your song but they took a lot of people away people that they thought
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:36.040]  we're gonna make trouble for them people that had guns and things they wanted they just took them away
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:41.960]  and where we education camps that they call it so part of it we have to break through our kind of
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:46.520]  private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:54.680]  the kids belong to whole communities i have decided we really need camps for adults and
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:01.160]  we need the type of camps that you all run i mean really all persons of japanese descent
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:05.800]  were required to register now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:11.400]  almost overnight had built assembly centers come on i'm a sorry citizen i refuse to recognize you
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.560]  guys what kind of a situation in the u.s would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.600]  constitution missing a lot of people that it's not power weapons plus you have a lot of people
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:26.040]  that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build ids and to
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:32.840]  defeat law enforcement techniques these people are radicalized and they don't support the united
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:37.640]  states and they're disloyal to the united states it's our right and our obligation
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.040]  to segregate them from the normal community
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:51.480]  is what we're doing here unless not kidding about it we're building a domestic army because the
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:59.880]  government is afraid of its own citizens put your gun down really rallying patriots worldwide
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:06.440]  in defense of human liberty it's alex jones are you some kind of a constitutionalist
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:16.440]  so these people will hold themselves out to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:33.080]  terrorists if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:51.800]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us i'm going to take some phone calls

[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:14.440]  and we will uh get you up and on the air to talk about all the huge news that's breaking
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:18.520]  all the big developments what do you make of what i covered first hour that trump
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.120]  is preparing to start releasing 9 11 information about the stand down
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:29.400]  about robert mehler and the cover-up all of it that's an exclusive to info wars.com from high
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:36.440]  level sources and we get into the opening salvos of that it's a big big deal now
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:44.520]  let me hit something really critical if you try to watch any major netflix movie or you try to go
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:51.800]  to the movie theater or you try to just go online almost every major storyline movie you name it
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:58.680]  has evil white people hurting black people and then making hundreds of movies the last few years
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:04.920]  where it's just saturated everywhere about injustices in the past and uh you know the newest movies
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:13.000]  the purge the first purge where it shows the army and the trumpian like future uh with with van
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:21.080]  jones in the movie with the army wearing kkk uniforms uh coming out and killing black people
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:27.240]  and their children this is all a simulation to create the idea that this is happening if you
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:33.880]  read the documents we got in january from 2015 where the soros group was trying to create civil
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:39.560]  war and race war to bring in marshal law and and it's their own documents where they're setting it
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:44.440]  up it's their own documents where they're doing it where they're in maryland in baltimore and other
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:52.840]  blue city areas working with local police to stage attacks burn this attack that it's why it's always
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:39:02.040]  stylized turn over a dumpster burn a trash can knock out some corporate windows and it says how
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:07.080]  to do it and they're told where to go what to do they are trained actors they're mainly college
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:12.600]  professors and again the family of one of these guys when he got in trouble got into his house and
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.080]  got all this material and and again the media has never covered this and no one else has ever picked
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.760]  it up they don't want anybody looking this is criminal racketeering in my view we need indictments
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:27.960]  by the justice department this is soros's son running all this this is unbelievable and they sign
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:34.520]  on to it their action plan everything and so when you see the massive level of brainwashing you know
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.640]  what they're trying to do they're trying to get a charlotte's fill type event going they're trying to
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:42.840]  get normal anti-trump crowds out then they're trying to have some white supremacist or white
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.240]  supremacist like type groups come that are obviously led by the globalists that's even come out
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:54.120]  to then have the clash and then blame it on trump and america to create an explosion in this country
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.920]  and the removal of the confederate statues and all of this that people just wander by
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:04.520]  and don't even care about it's all just done to create a tenderbox and you can see it in the news
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.080]  they're hyping it they're hyping it they're hyping it they're hyping it now when we come back
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:14.040]  before i go to your calls what are they really hyping other than that even bigger than race war
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.720]  this just went up on info wars dot com it's an exclusive nobody else has picked this up
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:28.120]  drag tots cartoon sparks outrage baby drag queen cartoon marketed to young children and again we've
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:35.480]  gone to uh in fact it's back during the producer's office we've gone to target before and then seen
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:40.600]  you know the uh feminist baby and she's not going to be a girl she's going to be a boy
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:46.040]  and there's a little picture of her naked butt in it it's all very weird and and this is so creepy
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:50.040]  folks this is pedophilia in my view this whole agenda i'm not saying these people are that made
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:55.800]  this but the agenda of centralizing children going into the schools uh going in when they're
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:01.320]  three four five six seven years old and showing them this and confusing them is designed to create
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:06.520]  mental illness and camille paglia is a classical liberal and a lesbian and she'll tell you that
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:11.560]  that's a fact i'm a libertarian this is not adult activity this is targeting children now here it is
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:17.560]  baby feminist and then and then she says she's a boy in here again it isn't about a woman if she
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:22.360]  wants to be a man being a man or thinking she is it's about them force feeding it it's all coming up

[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:36.840]  that we are the tip of the spear we're under the most attack because we're moving the ball
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:42.280]  down the field and they know full and good well we're a conduit for the make america great again

[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.160]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:13.560]  rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:19.960]  metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:26.440]  employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:32.600]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:38.440]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:45.640]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:51.800]  the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:58.760]  water supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it you know if i
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:04.600]  tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products we have it in fullers life it take hours
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.880]  michael zx plus and now is a lower price it's stronger it's the other equation in probiotics

[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.280]  word again thank you so much for being part of the second american revolution
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:04.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:31.400]  i've got a topic i'm about to break down that's extremely disturbing
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:37.800]  and i'd say parental discretion is advised but this is what's targeting your children in target
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:45.080]  a walmart online you name it stuff like this is being sold the story is up on info wars.com
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:52.120]  drag tots cartoon sparks outrage baby drag queen cartoon marketed to young children
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:57.560]  now and they're actually modeled after some of these hideous looking obese men
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:03.640]  that we've seen that in new york and everywhere that they roll out at story time for little kids
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.560]  and we've played the video where they're like you're going to be a drag queen shake your butt
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:13.480]  you know do all this and then they sexualize the children paint them up tell them that there's
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:18.840]  something else and then they had the drag queen festival this year here in austin it showed little
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:29.080]  children as young as two toddling up and putting money in the g string of obese men wearing wigs
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:37.000]  i mean it'd be bad enough if the guys actually look like women but it's a celebration of hideousness
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:44.040]  and that's all part of this plan and so this is being done everywhere and they're sexualizing
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:51.080]  children it is completely outrageous it's never too early to slip into your first
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.360]  pair of heels contour your cheekbones and learn the basics of drag culture reads an
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:02.040]  announcement for drag tots an upcoming cartoon about baby drag queens see how do you sexualize
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:07.880]  children this is how you do it and the event in austin i mean we can show it was men twerking
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:14.120]  men twerking to show it show it in front of small children
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.920]  and we've got men pole dancing and shaking their butts in children's face here let's show
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:26.840]  tv viewers when the little children run up and give them the money so would you take a three-year-old
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:33.400]  to the yellow rose here in austin texas that's a straight strip club i mean i personally not my
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:38.600]  cup of tea i've been in college one time jill rogan wanted to go like 18 years ago we went
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:44.120]  yeah i've been to topless bars been to plenty of them don't like them uh but i might condemn people
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:53.560]  to want to go to them but the point is is that if i saw people at a strip club with a two-year-old
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:59.880]  sticking a ten dollar bill in a woman's g-string i'd walk up and say what the hell is your problem
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:05.320]  so but when they do it and by the way there's some photos we put in the video that i don't
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:09.720]  know if i should show like children naked with only glitter on their bodies next to men with
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:16.200]  only glitter on their genitals and i mean you talk about a freak show ladies and gentlemen
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:24.360]  i mean this is the culture this is the cult of sexualizing children and it and children practicing
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:29.320]  you know strip teases you know i can't look and getting money for it take it down take it down
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:37.320]  this is truly an abomination but see oh because it's gay or it's liberal it's okay this is just
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:42.440]  like the guy got busted this week running the big children's charity for abused and kidnapped

[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:43.560]  the white house drive trump out was the same thing they said last year in the full page ads but that
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:49.160]  was the beta test they're making their move kicking off basically now that's why you've got people
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:53.160]  getting confronted you've got threats you've got physical threats you've got bricks through windows
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:58.520]  you've got protests turned violent as demonstrators arrested in front of philadelphia ice building

[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:22.360]  i mean it is it is just starting to pour in ladies and gentlemen that they're trying to create
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:28.120]  this big breakdown so there's a good chance i'll end up being live tomorrow with emergency
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:39.800]  broadcast because you know they're heating up for some serious things uh now who should we go to first
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:46.840]  hmm there's so many people to get to here trying to tie something into the whole unrest thing
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.360]  let's talk to tyler in wisconsin who was attending a keeping families together rally
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:59.640]  anti for violence so what did you see tyler well you know uh what i saw on tv anyways with the anti
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:05.400]  for violence in portland you saw what happened there right you saw the the violence the attack
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:11.240]  yeah i saw i mean the police admit the anti first started it yes yes so i was in madison
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:15.960]  wisconsin at a keeping families together rally and uh i don't know if you know about madison
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:21.160]  the demographics here but it's a lot like austin it's a it's a blue bubble it's a liberal bubble
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:26.920]  in the middle of a bunch of working class folks exactly it's a parasitic liberal parasite bubble
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:33.240]  exactly and and it's such an echo chamber so the antifa here they don't have to get violent with
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:38.840]  people because no one goes out on the street to resist this stuff there's no one from the
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:42.760]  the trump there's no trump supporters me and my friends were the only trump supporters
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.800]  in attendance at this entire thing and we were wearing the hillary for prison shirts and we were
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:53.000]  wearing the make america great again had and uh we went out there and we were getting just dirty
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.760]  looks from people but there was music playing and uh we just went out and we started a dance party
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:03.000]  that's what we decided to do we went out and decided to start a dance party and see if we
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.480]  could get some people from the other side to just come out and dance with us and i was on uh
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:14.600]  i was on the war room with oren schreuer last week as a guest and uh i i was uh i got so many
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:20.680]  messages from the listeners and uh it was it was insane i got so much positive we need to get our
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:24.920]  people out on the streets it's so important and videotape what you do and put it up on youtube
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:29.160]  and places because that's how we're going to win the information war just showing how bizarre and
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:34.600]  hateful the left is just showing how they look like a bunch of feckless zombies really illustrates
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:40.200]  what happened to these people you go to a leftist rally they look like they're dead i don't care
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:44.840]  what color they are and you look at conservatives or just libertarians they're all like red-blooded
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:50.280]  i i could walk over to a white person black person you name it and guess or you conservative
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:54.440]  you're a christian aren't you and it's like some really outstanding you know family the white folks
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:58.600]  black folks whatever they'll go yeah we're we're christians we're we're pro america and you can
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:03.640]  just see it and it's really becoming like a dichotomy like something has sucked the souls of
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:09.480]  these people have you noticed that i have noticed that and like you said about the taking your video
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:14.120]  camera and doing it like i knew you guys were doing the info wars reporters submission but i
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:17.640]  didn't really want to enter the contest because i don't want to like take a handout because i saw
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.720]  what happened to the last guy who gave a handout with the long hair who lives in his grandma's
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:26.440]  basement and we haven't heard from that guy since what two months now have we heard from that guy
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:33.240]  no so like but but i got so much support from the listeners on the war room and i i decided to get

[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.360]  what
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:08.360]  alex jones
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:14.040]  scum russian scum
[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:18.680]  info wars comes to mind
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:29.000]  reputation is amazing i will not let you down you will be very very impressed i hope
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:36.760]  you know why those intros say alex jones alex jones so much
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:42.360]  because we can take even small radio stations that have no ratings and usually get them
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:46.520]  mid-level or high ratings within a year because that's how it works is with arbitration all that
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:50.120]  is name recognition so you gotta say the name over and over again the radio stations like that
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:55.400]  because that's how they stay afloat okay we are back live well into the third hour our guests
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:59.160]  will be riding shotgun with us for the hour maybe a little bit longer i know we've got
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:04.760]  loaded phones we'll also pop in and get your calls on muhler on the liberals calling for revolution
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.120]  all of it
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:13.880]  joey gibson is the founder of the patriot prayer group and is running for us senate as a republican
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:18.840]  joey is fighting for freedom with the strength and power from god and love gibson for freedom
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:25.560]  dot com and he goes out to these events he just has prayer vigils and the left gets really triggered
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:29.560]  by that comes out and they do it up and down the west coast will johnson also does it you're not
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:34.200]  america first dot com what a great website but even greater info he's involved in he's a founder
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:38.360]  of the unamerica first a movement that began during 2016 election and i've heard him talk on my show
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:42.440]  and others about it he just kept seeing the lies and the race baiting and how evil it was and he
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:47.160]  just had this knot in his gut it's not in his chest i'm the same way i can be totally exhausted
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:50.840]  like eight at night something big happens i just suddenly have all this energy like when they attack
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:55.080]  me too i don't like being attacked when i know they're lying i suddenly it doesn't make me get
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.840]  scared when they do these horrible things to me it's the opposite people say oh you're so brave
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:04.360]  brave i'd really be brave i just laid down and let these dogs chew my guts out it's the opposite
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:09.800]  i'm fighting for my life here these people are evil that's what we're talking about here
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:15.160]  uh so will johnson and joey gibson let's go to will first but jump in anytime joey uh wow what
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:21.240]  happened this weekend even the local news had to admit antifa attack first uh bottles i mean well
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:28.040]  you were there tell folks what happened you know i want to thank you for having me on again and
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:35.160]  i'm thankful for joey to invite me to his uh event it was absolutely crazy we were completely
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:41.880]  peaceful dhs did a beautiful job they did an awesome job they protected all of us when we were going
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:46.840]  into the event we had to if anyone had peppermates or anything like that they had to give it to dhs
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:53.000]  so we didn't have anything to protect ourselves from the antifa domestic terrorist groups but i
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.200]  want to it was absolutely insane for what they were doing it's just like berkeley all over again
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:03.880]  we'd go there we're completely peaceful we're trump supporters we're black we're brown we're
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:09.640]  right we're all together no one's fighting is only when we go out onto the streets where antifa
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:15.320]  and the portland police didn't do their job to protect us well that's in the soros documents
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:21.640]  that they work with blue city police to stand out even let them engage in violence uh joey tell us
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:26.120]  about your prayer group that the event you've had and why you think antifa particularly attacks these
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:32.600]  yeah so basically you know we started doing this because we saw people getting beat up in the streets
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:38.040]  during the uh trump election down in san jose so the goal was to go out and just challenge it and
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:43.160]  expose them but at the same time you know our rhetoric has always been about love and and prayer
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:48.680]  and talking about god yet these people come out of nowhere and they hate that they hate the freedom
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:53.880]  aspect okay because a lot more communists and they seem to just really hate the message of god like
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:58.600]  they despise it and so they they just come out they come from all over the west coast to whatever
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:04.200]  rally we're throwing and they're gonna use violence and do whatever it takes to silence us what was
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:09.080]  the big takeaway from this latest one a and then b it's here they say revolution they say they're
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.920]  going to launch the attacks there's arrest all over the country attacks happening everywhere
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:16.280]  behind the scenes i can't get to it yet on air they have launched attacks against me and my family
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:22.040]  that are out of a twilight zone movie i mean i mean i'm talking basically like intelligence
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:27.320]  agencies but it's the democratic party in soros he's put 18 billion in i mean this is the battle is
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:33.480]  really heating up i would say there's two things to take from this number one you know we're at a
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:38.680]  point now it's unfortunate you know i have a lot of respect for most of the police i think most of
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:42.120]  the police officers they want to do their job but right now they're just standing down especially
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:47.000]  in portland orgin and so i kind of want to make a call for these guys to make conscientious decision
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.880]  to to protect the constitution which is the first amendment if you get an order from someone above you
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:57.080]  that's asking you to to go against the constitution you need to do what is right the second thing i'm
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:01.160]  going to take from this is if the police are going to stand down and we're not going to have law and
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:04.680]  order you're going to have patriots from all over the country come in and they're going to do their
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:10.760]  job like you saw on saturday because they had antifa they had sharp members running scared
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:15.080]  i don't know there's that viral video where that sharp member you know had a baton went up against
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:20.760]  a guy a proud boy who had nothing but his arm you know blocked it twice hit him with one punch and
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.400]  he was out he was done and so i think patriots will begin to stand up and take back the streets
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:30.760]  and again i've watched hours of the videos how they would throw the bottles they would attack
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:35.160]  first the police stood down you guys would kick their butt like tommy robinson fighting off nine
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:38.840]  guys himself even though he's a little guy describe the essence of that and then we're
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:47.080]  going to go to break of of of what happened so yeah it's like okay we'll talk about june 3rd for
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:53.640]  example so that was the first portland rally a few weeks ago you have these antifa kids chasing
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.960]  after families people who can't really defend themselves you look at hailey adams and her
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:03.000]  family they attacked them you know stole their property beat them up because they saw them as
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:08.360]  an easy target same thing with an elderly man um kerry hudson they went after them because they
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:13.320]  can't take on the real patriots willing to defend themselves so june 30th comes along and there
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:16.920]  there's all this rhetoric about how i'm not going to be able to show up because they're
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:20.920]  going to kill me they're going to stab me all this talk they show up they go running down the
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:25.800]  streets and the patriots just chase them a whole block down and they and we just show dramatic
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:31.480]  footage will come back with again you were there i mean you've got a guy with one of those extendable
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:35.800]  metal clubs you can kill somebody with a police baton basically an extendable baton
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:41.560]  so they could break your bones whipping it at you and of course they got fellow steps in and just
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:47.880]  boom total ko knockout boom and they don't and the woman tries to attack you that's their thing
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:50.840]  they try to get women to attack you so you got to defend yourself and they go oh you attacked

[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:33.080]  the last 10 years of antifa beating up women people in wheelchairs uh they come out to christian
[02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:38.600]  rallies and uh we'll run up ahead a woman in the back of the head they are the art typal weasel
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:43.320]  wimps and then you look at the average antifa they're like a meth ed shriveled white kid
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:49.000]  head or professor running around screaming about racist white people everywhere they'll have the
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:54.200]  occasional mental patient or meth head they show up with their clubs and weapons and then as soon
[02:20:54.200 --> 02:20:59.720]  as one of them gets knocked out they always turn and run and you'll see them target women with
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:05.160]  bike locks and a whole crowd do it it's incredible so we've got will johnson who's with united america
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:09.960]  first dot com and joey gibson who has these uh christian prayer group rallies where they're all
[02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:13.720]  inclusive and just trying to have peace and people come out and attack as they said a few weeks ago
[02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:18.520]  in portland they attacked men women children hell in berkeley they attacked millie weaver
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:22.360]  and her husband and and baby and attacked her car i've told millie don't go out there without
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:26.680]  security but she still doesn't she's got a lot of courage but the fact that you have to go out
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:30.920]  these families try to go to fourth of july operates they just caught a guy trying to blow it up in
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:37.240]  cleveland was going to give toy cars with bombs in it uh it's just the level of the hate and the
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:42.600]  insanity and this guy they just arrested look document him shot on this guy if we can or maybe
[02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:47.400]  pull it up on info wars dot com man who threatened to murder rand paul's children is an obama
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:53.080]  supporting berkeley resident and again he's wearing women's glasses he looks like you know
[02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:57.000]  he probably couldn't bench press 50 pounds but he talks about i'm gonna kidnap i'm gonna murder
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.400]  your children i'm gonna cut their guts out then i'm gonna murder you he's facing 10 years in
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:06.120]  prison turns out on his twitter i went to his twitter he was in there for weeks threatening
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:10.600]  all the republicans he goes look at my hit list i've death-threaded all these people
[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:17.720]  so finally because rand paul has been shot at let's release he has been six of his ribs broken
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:23.560]  a lung punctured you know painful it is for six weeks when you've had ribs broken i've had it
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:29.000]  nothing like that never had a lung punctured i mean i got caved him in attacked him jumped up and down
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:34.200]  and tried to kill him okay he's not even getting in hardly any trouble and and and now this guy
[02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:38.680]  wants to kill him and then rand paul's actually a libertarian anti-war guy the left so craze
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:44.360]  they don't even know who to hate so uh it's unbelievable ladies and gentlemen so getting back
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:50.200]  to joey gibson uh joey describe what it's like when these cowards come up with metal batons
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:53.960]  really trying to kill you and then folks are knocking them out with one punch and then the
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:58.360]  rest of the cowards run they're so tough till one of them gets hit they all turn and run the
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:04.840]  definition of scum yeah absolutely and that's why it's really important that we unite we come
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:09.400]  together we come together mass numbers and just have each other's backs because the only way they
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:14.120]  can really win is if we break we you know we fall apart we divide we get people to go off on their
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:18.120]  own and that's exactly what happened at haley's adam's family which they they had the courage to
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:23.320]  do it but they crossed the street wearing bag of hats which that's the right to do you know um they
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:27.880]  went across the street and they confronted antifa and then they just started attacking her father
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:33.160]  her mother her sister they held down haley and stole their property right in front of the police
[02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:37.160]  and so they'll do that they'll act real tough there's a lot of lack tough for the second they
[02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:42.360]  got to go toe to toe with any patriot and they start running you know they get one punch and
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:46.840]  they're done and so you know unfortunately the only thing they can do is try to find a victim
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:54.520]  so we can't defend themselves well i know this well i've seen the videos of them coming up
[02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:58.920]  attacking women and strollers and stuff these women need to be packing man thugs are assaulting
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:04.520]  women they need to defend themselves yeah absolutely will johnson what do you say to that
[02:24:06.280 --> 02:24:11.560]  you know we shouldn't have to be afraid to go out as americans every time we have a rally a
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:18.360]  conservative rally a christian rally a pro-trump rally every single time nine times out of ten we
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:25.640]  will get antifa blm bam and now the brown berets in california to be aggressive to us to attack us
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:32.040]  simply because we respect the american flag we'll stand to the national anthem this fighting is all
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:38.920]  due to the democrats and i'm calling the democrats domestic terrorists they are a hundred percent
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:45.000]  domestic terrorist group in the united states you have maxi waters calling for violence towards
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.720]  conservatives anyone who's on the trump administration can you imagine had this happened
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:55.960]  if obama was in office and you had a republican do this they would it would be if a republican
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:01.960]  was saying rise up surround them beat people up i'd say hell no i mean exactly this is
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:06.280]  they call us nazis this is exactly how hitler came to power with the brown shirts they did this
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:12.440]  exact same thing yes exactly and we have to experience this every single time we're a hundred
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:17.080]  percent peaceful we were at joey's rally and a hundred percent peaceful everyone getting along it
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:25.240]  wasn't until we went out in the street to where we had amazing cameras don't catch it all but i mean
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.640]  describe what it's like when these antifa come up and try to basically kill you with with you know
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:34.120]  with with metal pipes and they're swinging for the fences and then one of them gets hit and they all
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.280]  run i mean what is that like because it looks very exhilarating when the guy just i want to give that
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.040]  that guy an award do we know who that guy is it just cold cocked that guy that tried to kill him with
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.480]  the club i mean that is just that's the that's that's the real deal right there
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:54.360]  yeah that's rufio he's a proud boy he's in washington uh up in the seattle area real big
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:59.080]  dude works out all the time and he has a big heart he's a really good guy and uh we appreciate him
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:03.000]  standing in there and sticking up for all the people who are marching you know the women
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  and the elderly and just standing up like a real man that's that's the spirit that we got to have
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:12.120]  in this country and so i agree i want to get him on because let me say this notice it took one man
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:16.600]  to stand up to those thugs they all ran one man they're all up their stick in their chest out with
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:21.160]  their clubs with their maces with their weapons they took one guy to stand up and knock them
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:27.560]  upside the head they all ran what do you i mean isn't that archetypal yeah absolutely and it really
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:34.040]  represents you know that's the true american spirit right there right it's about it's no fear it's
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:37.880]  just standing up for what you believe in and that's what the whole rally was about the freedom
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:43.000]  encouraged rally it's about you know it takes courage to really stand up for freedom to get
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.280]  freedom and that's it right there it represents it and to just see him stand up to him and he had no
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.200]  hesitation and that's what i love and that's what i appreciate it and it was completely justified
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:57.400]  it's all self-defense and so we you know he pretty much became a hero overnight that's right you
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:01.320]  should have seen him he drove back with us to the bar he walked up to the bar and the whole bar
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:05.560]  just started chanting his name because it was all over the country and again say his name again
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:12.120]  his name's rufio ethan rufio well we need to get him on asap and it's not because he attacked
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:17.000]  somebody he stood up to five or six guys waving weapons at him and then they all turned and ran
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.560]  that's what it's all about it's not striking first and that's my big concern guys i'm worried
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:25.480]  they've been caught you know obviously trying to stage that whole clash with the police ordering
[02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:31.400]  the new right folks that i don't agree with a lot what they have to say into the anti-fascum and
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:35.080]  trump was right to condemn both sides but the police made them clash it's come out the police
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:39.480]  stood down i'm concerned they're going to pull more of that and try to get get a big race war
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:46.200]  going what do you think will yeah i completely agree with you when we were walking down portland
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:54.120]  police they actually saw antifa and the america supporters i like to call them facing off and they
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:28:00.200]  did nothing to prevent what took place you know we are in a civil war it's not a hot civil war but
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:05.400]  the democrats are pushing for a racial division they're pushing for a racial war and modern
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:10.200]  main goal is to stop that because we should not be fighting each other based on one's complexion
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:15.000]  they are literally trying to destroy the united states they're so bitter they're so angry because
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.360]  donald j trump is the president and every time we have these rallies we have to be on the guard
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:25.880]  people women come out with helmets on come out with full metal jacket gear on because they wanted
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:31.240]  to avoid the violence with these antifa domestic terrorists that's the foot soldiers for the
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:37.720]  democratic party every single time every single day we see this from the left that's right and

[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:51.960]  lebron james uh Muhammad Ali those are not my heroes okay they're interesting they're
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:57.000]  you can admire them for their prowess great but it's moral courage and standing up against
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.800]  the peer pressure and the attacks and the demonizations and the threats and being shot at and being
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:07.000]  having ribs broken and and being shot and and i'm not bitching hell i people say man how do you
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.600]  take all this well these are bad people i i'm fighting them because i know they're bad now
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:16.120]  they've proven i was right but i mean at a certain point you just can't keep rolling over
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:21.720]  but i gotta tell you uh i don't like going out around antifa i first learned that they were
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:28.520]  like 15 years ago anti fascist anti racist and a guy named um steve mason uh he's still in austin
[02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:34.760]  he's a interesting guy he was a leftist but he was really an anti-racist and when he was going
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:39.080]  to college up in mayna he's an older guy which gets to find out steve mason's number i got it
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:42.920]  somewhere get him in here and he was like the primitive expert he had this show called texas
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:48.200]  front line and he'd say the communists are now called the anti racist anti fascist group boa
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:51.560]  blind and i would know those are the guys that always come in like hit me in the back when i'm
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:55.320]  doing a rally for a second amendment he goes yeah yeah those are them and they're like all
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:58.840]  professors and they're all and they're they're funded by big banks and all this and boy was he
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:03.800]  a trailblazer and right about this and he predicted the whole communist underground being prepared
[02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:07.480]  and for in the future they were going to launch all this and then they were going to kind of collapse
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:13.720]  the borders for the un and the world population operation and now the un is saying we're going
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:19.560]  to occupy the eu and we're going to stop nation states stopping tens of millions pouring in
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:25.240]  and they had a plan under hillary to bring the un in that's in the associated press so
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:32.040]  when you pull back and see this giant thing they're launching decades in the making thank god populism
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:37.240]  from south america to areas of africa to asia to strong in eastern europe the brexit
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:43.000]  and in and you know out in the uh... atlantic ocean all of it's like humanity isn't getting
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:48.040]  coordinated when the fbis questioned hundreds of people now about me they keep saying how does
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:52.120]  jones know what trump's going to say how does jones is jones talking to trump every day uh
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:55.880]  who's the mastermind you know and they're really doing this they don't get it's like a spirit
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:00.040]  they've got their evil spirit the mystery of evil the bible talks about uh i remember reading
[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:03.720]  this was a kid in bible state i thought really there's like an evil thing that coordinates and
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:08.440]  that's the mystery of evil outworks and then god's got his own holy spirit but when you actually get
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:14.840]  to this level it's like we're all coordinated they're all coordinated and but they're coordinated
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:19.320]  digitally and with commands and orders and propaganda and also a spirit of hate but there's
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:23.320]  a real spirit so since i know both of you guys are christians so am i i'm not some guy up here on
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:27.880]  a high horse i just love god love christ and i and that's what gives me my strength joey you're
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:31.720]  you're a christian what makes you and we're gonna go to calls with both of you guys what made you
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:35.800]  understand you had to do this i mean was it a not in your chest like will talked about because
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:41.240]  that's what is with me and then almost like a burning up my spine and then in my mind like i
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:45.320]  it's in my gut starts here and then it's like i gotta do something because it's not like i gotta
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:49.960]  go be a champion or hero it's like evil's coming on me i gotta do something and i've and i've seen
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:54.360]  will talk about that feeling you know you know evil when you see it can you speak to the spiritual
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:37:00.760]  element of this yeah actually alex uh big part of the story has to do with you um i've always been
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.480]  awake in terms of the corruption in our government i've always been a libertarian constitutionalist
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:10.040]  and i started to listen to you for a while and i really you know i watched a lot of your shows the
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:14.920]  one thing you kept pushing is that you can't just listen to your show you have to go out and participate
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:18.680]  and you kept pushing that and pushing that and pushing that and it really spoke to me and what
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:23.400]  had happened is a bunch of people got beat up in san jose when they're leaving a trump rally
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:26.920]  and at that point i was done like i was done sitting in my house i didn't know what i was
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:31.800]  going to do but i'm going to go out there and participate and it was a spiritual um journey
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:36.840]  for me and the first thing i did is i booked my tickets and i went down to cleveland to the rnc
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:41.800]  where which you were at and i went to your rally i heard you speak you know i shook your hand and
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:46.360]  i came back home a completely different person and just completely committed to making change in
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:51.800]  this culture the one thing i said in my speech is that if you see evil clears day which i was
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:56.360]  seeing and you do nothing and you say nothing then you're just as much to blame so i refuse to
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:38:01.080]  stand down that's pretty much it right there that's beautiful uh tell us your story uh well
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:06.600]  you know i truly believe we're in a civil war and i have to admit to something
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:13.080]  brain force actually works for people who don't realize i mean it actually works so when i would
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:18.040]  go to these rallies i would pop two brain force and i was just right on it every single time
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:23.800]  knocking them out the liberals are confronting them the brain force absolutely works i can
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:30.920]  say it firsthand but this spiritual war that we're in is a battle and i just like joey said i
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:35.240]  used to listen to you you say people you've got to speak up you've got to do your own video do your
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:41.720]  own podcast do those do those and that not because you were doing that not actually just got bigger
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:47.400]  in my chest and i had to speak out so i mean i'm in complete agreement with joey and what you just
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:51.960]  said and the reason we tell those stories is that's all happened to us at one time or another
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:56.920]  and then you guys inspire me i inspire you we all inspire each other and then we show like when
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:02.760]  we had the rally our rally uh at the at cleveland i was so proud that more than half that crowd
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:07.480]  wasn't white and that everybody loved each other everybody was hugging there were hispanic black
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:13.080]  folks asians white guys white bikers you know uh you know you know guys with their iron cross
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:17.640]  cat tattoos in their arms you know hugging black folks and and i see trump and the tea party and
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:22.360]  all this healing it's it's actually the most loving place you can go to a tea party event
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:26.520]  or a trump event that is the most open people have light in their eyes they're good you go to a
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:31.480]  leftist event again i'm not putting them down they look like somebody sucked their soul this is
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:38.440]  spiritual is what i'm saying exactly when i went to the kevin de Leon and i confronted him about
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:43.960]  why is he putting illegals before the american people i was the only black male in the room
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:48.760]  and then they all looked demonic and they all started attacking me they were yelling at me
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:53.320]  saying it's not true and it is absolutely true that he's putting the illegals before the american
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:57.240]  citizen that's why we're in a predicament that we're in right now with the borders and with
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:04.440]  the immigration situation this war that we're in is not just about left and right democrats and
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:09.320]  republicans it is a spiritual war and they're trying to create they're trying to bring this war
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:14.600]  that we're having to a hot war in america and i truly believe like i said before we are in a
[02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:18.760]  the second civil war in this nation i agree you've been saying that for a year that i've
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:23.320]  seen your videos but as we cross over i think they're trying to go hot right now but none of them
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:27.880]  want to get the full blame uh more is willing to say it maxine in a way i respect them as they're
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:32.440]  willing to say it uh but but but they're they're really i see them launching it right now the
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:38.680]  numbers are pouring in the attacks are all over the place yes they are i mean maxine workers gave
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:45.320]  the okay to antifa bam blm and a brown berets or anybody who doesn't agree with the trump
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:51.320]  administration to go out and attack them to approach them when they're simply having dinner
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:56.840]  with their families they're saying heckle them be aggressive towards them attack them where they are
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:01.080]  just it sounds to me let's just like the islamic terrorists attack the infidels where they are
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:08.200]  that's right and msnbc msnbc has a host i played earlier saying oh sarah sanders gets a life
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:12.680]  sentence she's not allowed to be comfortable anywhere chase her down everywhere i mean that is
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:19.960]  that is so brown shirt it is a hundred percent they they can't they complain and say that trump
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:26.520]  is the neo nazi supporter that he's a white supremacist both joey and i were called white
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:33.400]  supremacist by nancy polosi is they everything that they do that they say they're they're against
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:40.920]  that's exactly what they do it's it's unbelievable i can feel the energy i i mean they're losing but
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:46.600]  they're freaking out i i think the next few weeks i think we're gonna see some real violence i agree
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:52.520]  you know what that's why i'm constantly screaming we have to vote them out because we don't vote them
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:57.160]  out in 2018 we all lose it doesn't matter if you're a republican democrat and will you made a great
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:01.400]  point they've proven they're a criminal globalist chai kong funded organization that wants to
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:04.760]  overthrow the country we have to get rid of the democratic party and create a new party
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:10.760]  absolutely the democratic party the domestic terrorist group they're promoting violence
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:16.920]  a hundred percent their foot soldiers is antifa blm band and the brown berets a hundred percent
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:23.480]  wow uh joey we're going to break you want to say something yeah something real quick just uh i
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:27.320]  know we don't have much time but we got to break through the lies there's this attempt to make us

[02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:29.320]  here brother absolutely right i agree um one of my nine was a completely question we know nine
[02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:34.680]  eleven was an inside job conducted by terminal elements fell out within our government um pretty
[02:51:34.680 --> 02:51:40.120]  much all the evidence shows that nine eleven is what will be up personally you producing
[02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:46.680]  loose change among many other things um in my opinion nine eleven is the Pandora's box
[02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:54.680]  the skeleton key to open up the doors to the global field order for those who are still asleep so
[02:51:56.200 --> 02:52:01.000]  my question on on front nine eleven stands because if we're ever going to take back to
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:05.720]  full of the deep space the people who were you know behind nine eleven needed to be brought to
[02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:11.320]  their knees put in prison or worse how do you see the point in the world and i'm very interested
[02:52:11.320 --> 02:52:15.720]  in your answer there how do you see a point with really joy on being a Trump warrior sure let me
[02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:19.240]  answer that your phone's breaking up but i got most of it i can do a whole hour on this and i
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:25.160]  promise you i will do a live feed after the show just on that question because i was thinking the
[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:30.600]  same thing last night and this morning look if you bring out full nine eleven which Trump would
[02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:35.720]  like to do it will tank the stock market there will be a civil war on our side and it will
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:40.840]  it's kind of like a thing in war is where the enemy surrenders you let them basically leave
[02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:45.960]  and go live on an island like with Napoleon it's been found to be better and so
[02:52:47.480 --> 02:52:51.000]  nine eleven did have Islamic involvement but there were criminal elements working with
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:55.480]  stand down and all the rest of it and bombs the buildings and so Trump knows that he said that at
[02:52:55.480 --> 02:52:59.480]  the time that's why he's attacked and now he's letting the deep state know i'll play the ace card
[02:52:59.480 --> 02:53:05.560]  ace of spades if you try this okay and so i trust the president on this i'm the one that got i'm
[02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:09.720]  not going to get into it all but the president's ready to move and he intends to bring it all out
[02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:14.520]  in good time that's a very complex issue though i mean Trump is the president now will from the
[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:19.320]  president joey he knows all this damning stuff he's kind of giving them rope and i'm not saying
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:25.480]  he should cover anything up but there's so much dirt if he made it all about that we would go into
[02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:30.680]  a civil war so there's a there's a real wisdom to this and i i'm i'm lined up with Trump's discernment
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:33.240]  and so i'm just taking it one step at a time well what do you think
[02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:41.640]  oh i think you're doing mine is good we get we get the job done we get results i've seen
[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:45.720]  you know you look at what's happening in Saudi Arabia i was always uncomfortable how friendly
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:50.680]  we've been with them especially the bushes and i i was uncomfortable with how friendly Trump is
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:55.880]  with them but if you look at it they're arresting people massively and it looks like things are
[02:53:55.880 --> 02:54:01.880]  being cleaned up oh he's kicking that whole group out yeah yeah so i just want results well exactly
[02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:05.880]  and look look we've already been lied to about bombs in the buildings and all this whenever
[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:10.280]  happened the point is if trump can get the people that did it out of power put some in prison that's
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:16.040]  great i'm not saying cover it up i'm just saying how do we bring this out i was just trying to
[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:20.360]  expose the conspirators so we get a good government to stop it but something this bad how do you
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:27.640]  bring that out that's what i'm asking no joey and will you know one of the things is go go ahead
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:33.240]  i was going to say one of the things is all you have to do is ask about building seven
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:38.520]  as soon as you ask about building seven they all shut down and you know one thing i hear Alex i
[02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:43.080]  hear a lot of people always talking about info wars is conspiracy theories but you know what you've
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:49.000]  always been correct i've yet to see them just prove what you're saying i mean you talk about news
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:55.880]  today that's going to happen tomorrow and then it becomes you know reality and they don't understand
[02:54:55.880 --> 02:54:59.880]  how was it possible that you're coming up with this information like you have to inside tracks
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:04.520]  to all of it and they don't like it that's why you get these talk shows attacking you the way
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:10.040]  that they do it's unbelievable the big secret is i'm not that smart the globalists communicate
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:14.200]  in publications with each other and admit all this and then with us they treat us like we're
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:18.200]  morons it's just it's just crazy i'm going to jam in one more call are you going to say something
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:24.600]  shall we i would also say maybe we should trust this strength of the public more than we do i
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:29.560]  think that we can't handle the truth and so i just understood that when you lie to the public all
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:34.920]  the time we tend to like you know we become too sensitive so i say the truth is great for the
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:40.040]  country now i hear you and and i i've not pushed trump to bring out 9 11 just because i wasn't
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:46.520]  even thinking about it and then i don't want to brag or anything but i mean he let me tell you
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:51.240]  i got told it's it's i mean it's it's his next deal i got told last night at 10 o'clock at night
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:58.920]  and i was like okay uh all right that's okay i'll yes sir i'll you know show wasn't trump
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:07.880]  obviously i was talking to but these guys are a lot of trouble man i can't believe how good
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:11.800]  trump is though am i gut my spirit tells me he's good but i keep getting paranoid like is this
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:15.720]  really happening what do you guys think about that i mean at a gut spiritual level what do you
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:20.600]  when you ask christ about trump what what do you get back i get back this is my wrecking ball get out
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:28.120]  of the way i think trump is what this country needed this day and time this 100 us i'm still
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:33.000]  thankful thank god that donald j trump is our president and not the hill the beast hillary
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.960]  clinton she would have destroyed everything the democrats are on the path to destroy this their
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:42.920]  state in a state they can't do anything but destroy yes that's that and that is their plan
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:47.720]  that's what they want to do and i think you know what we're doing and we're trying to expose all
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:52.840]  of that when i went to the cafe in oakland the whole point was to expose the hatefulness the
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:58.200]  evilness of the left 100 they're so hateful what happened to let them because i was younger
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:01.640]  a lot of nice hippies liberals that were smart about something was right they didn't have that
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:06.680]  spirit there were some bad republicans and bad democrats it was kind of a mix but
[02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:10.520]  something happened along the way with democrats i think just the media weaponized them
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:17.720]  i think personally i think satan realize his time is short so he's trying to work on these people to
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:23.320]  destroy you got to go faster and faster to do as much as you can to destroy this nation
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:29.240]  time is wasting a component to them if satan went to the dnc and was talking to the democrats
[02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:34.280]  which policy would the democrats disagree with none of them they would agree with all of them
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:39.320]  we'll be back the devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:43.320]  but he was understanding wrecking the number is six hundred and sixty six

[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:41.800]  trunks and stuff and i'm saying the most exciting thing is the young people are awake and it's not
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:47.000]  that info wars is important it's that it's a focal point for what we're really saying and that's why
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:51.160]  they hate it god bless you brad uh we're gonna get some final comments from our guests here in a
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:55.080]  moment but now let's go i wasn't wrong i said brad in texas they went to the other brad but that's
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:59.560]  okay that happens because i jump around brad in texas you're now on the air with our guests go ahead
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:05.400]  hey what's going on alex oh and everyone else welcome sir good to have you here well we're on
[03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:11.560]  the brink of a hot civil war it's been a it's been a stealth civil war uh as uh our guest have said
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:17.800]  well earlier you said what's bigger than race for but what's bigger than race for is that they
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:22.600]  need a race for to bring in the united nations to come and take over from uh all over the united
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:26.200]  states and by the way i used to hear old timers say that 25 years ago and i thought they were nuts
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:31.320]  those guys had all been in military intelligence now i know that was the plan then and now it's official
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:38.600]  and not just that i have documents from september of 1961 from the state department it's called
[03:03:38.600 --> 03:03:45.400]  the united states program for general and complete disarmament 7277 yep exactly that's what it is
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:49.640]  and basically it goes over how we need a stronger international institution to take over the united
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:53.800]  states and stop wars but the only way they're gonna have that happen to bring in the united
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:58.600]  it's the start of war exactly nobody's gonna frontal assault america they're gonna do it from
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:06.200]  within oh and anything else brad that's it sir well alex i i just want to agree with you and
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:10.520]  then you to comment from our guests here the info wars audience is the most powerful audience in
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:16.440]  the world yeah that's who they fear not me bar none it's not even close it's undoubtable because
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:21.800]  they're awake they know what's going on it's it's not us we're just a focal point and then you have
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:26.680]  will johnson here who's a perfect example who goes out and faces these people in the streets
[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:31.320]  that's what we need more of that's the bravery of this audience what other audience goes out
[03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:35.560]  and creates united america first dot com that's right paul watts is taking over i'm gonna final
[03:04:35.560 --> 03:04:39.240]  comment from both of these gentlemen and then and then we've got a special announcement for the
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:44.040]  president here straight ahead we're back in 60 seconds info wars dot com news wars dot com
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:48.760]  there's not a bigger act of rebellion against the globalist you can engage in and not a better
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:55.960]  act of uh being honorable to god than to spread the lengths of the show living in volcano may sound
[03:04:55.960 --> 03:05:01.800]  more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of
[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:07.560]  us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:13.720]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to
[03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:21.560]  unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what
[03:05:21.560 --> 03:05:26.200]  we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain
[03:05:26.200 --> 03:05:32.280]  water next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[03:05:32.280 --> 03:05:39.560]  metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out
[03:05:39.560 --> 03:05:45.240]  the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic
[03:05:45.240 --> 03:05:51.880]  ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration
[03:05:51.880 --> 03:06:15.800]  system will purify it the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:06:21.880 --> 03:06:32.920]  all right paul watchman's about to get on we only got two skyplines so we're going to get one of

[03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:44.840]  into hell christ is the way to get out of this and we know that and that's why they hate us

[03:08:01.080 --> 03:08:06.520]  goal is this is we respond by their violence with getting more people to show up if we can
[03:08:06.520 --> 03:08:11.000]  flood the streets with thousands of people you know we know the support is out there it's about
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:16.440]  inspiring them to actually go out there and stand up for what they believe in because the enemy the
[03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:20.840]  elites all these people at the top they don't want us to stand up for what we believe in they want
[03:08:20.840 --> 03:08:25.240]  us to remain silent and alex if you can be there you're the one guy that can you know bring thousands
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:30.520]  of people with you and we'd love to have you and i think it will make the event a lot more safe
[03:08:30.520 --> 03:08:36.040]  because we can't trust the police if we just flooded the streets i want to go to all these events
[03:08:36.040 --> 03:08:41.800]  here's the thing i've got a i'm here running these operations and i'm every day getting important
[03:08:41.800 --> 03:08:45.640]  communicates what we need to do and then i'm out and i want to do it and then i've got me pinned
[03:08:45.640 --> 03:08:49.320]  down because when i leave they go out for my family i've got to take my family with me now
[03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:53.560]  everywhere it's gotten really bad i can't get into all that i had to go off air yesterday because of

[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:12.440]  that we can actually send crews out to these events get the footage and that's the key is to get the
[03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:16.840]  footage and just put a camera up to these people and just say hey what are you doing out here oh
[03:09:16.840 --> 03:09:21.080]  you know i'm protesting uh the children being separated from children oh really i guess you
[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:25.640]  didn't care about it eight years ago then or whistleblowers have come out that obama would put
[03:09:25.640 --> 03:09:29.080]  them with child traffickers and have them unvetted oh that's here just let kids cross the border and
[03:09:29.080 --> 03:09:33.720]  get in vans randomly that's a great idea coyotes can just pick them right up on the texas side yeah

[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:26.920]  is the redcoats supreme leader paul joseph watson my friend please take over thanks alex happy 4th
[03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:31.880]  of july yeah i'm looking at these polls which have come out since the whole scandal over the
[03:12:31.880 --> 03:12:36.120]  border issue which of course was the the latest scandal that was supposed to sink president
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:40.920]  trump forgot we have one one every week from the mainstream media but what's happened this is really
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:47.000]  interesting over the course of the past two weeks just under is that president trump's approval rating
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  despite being relentlessly pounded by the mainstream media over this border enforcement issue
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:59.160]  is approval rating and this is real clear politics headline media failed trump's approval rating
[03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:05.720]  improved during manufactured border outrage this is real clear politics average of polls poll of
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:11.800]  polls is gone up by five points that's not even rasmussen you can't claim it's got republican
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:17.960]  bias this is the average of all the polls his approval rating has gone up five points since
[03:13:17.960 --> 03:13:25.000]  this whole separating children from their parents scandal that was supposed to sink him five point
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:33.320]  improvement you drill down into this poll a 10 point surge in support from wait for it hispanic
[03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:40.200]  americans 10 point surge since trump was supposedly finished with this big border scandal his average
[03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:45.960]  has gone up five points during the establishment media's manufactured outrage so the manufactured
[03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:51.800]  media's propaganda is boomeranging it's it's backfiring is what you're saying paul yes they've
[03:13:51.800 --> 03:13:57.640]  got no platform alex it's just constant hysteria remember that scream helplessly at the sky thing
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:09.240]  from last year they're still on that but then they're adding oh by the way start attacking
[03:14:09.240 --> 03:14:14.520]  trump supporters start attacking trump and then you look at another poll survey finds among white
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:21.160]  millennial men 23 percent move from democrats to gop in last two years so they have they already lost
[03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:27.640]  nine percent in millennial vote since 2016 which we covered before now another new poll has found that
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:32.920]  white millennial meant gee i wonder why white millennial men are shifting over to the gop
[03:14:32.920 --> 03:14:37.960]  when every single day the narrative is relentlessly white men are to blame for everything you know
[03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:45.720]  toxic masculinity kill all white men trending on twitter so at 23 percent shift from dems to gop
[03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:51.880]  in the last two years article reads the democrats have been relishing their popularity with millennials
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:57.960]  for for a variety of reasons 55 percent of millennials vote for hillary clinton 33 percent
[03:14:57.960 --> 03:15:04.600]  vote for trump but a new poll found that 23 percent have shifted even though you've obviously still
[03:15:04.600 --> 03:15:11.240]  got overwhelming support for the democrats among white millennial men it shifted big time a pure
[03:15:11.240 --> 03:15:15.640]  research study also found that millennials gave a 64 percent job approval rating to president
[03:15:15.640 --> 03:15:23.400]  and obama but 27 only 27 approval for trump in 2018 but this goes along alongside the ice poll
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:28.840]  obviously part of the freak out part of the screaming helplessly at the sky is this call
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:36.760]  to abolish ice which is also completely unpopular with the american people 73 percent of swing voters
[03:15:36.760 --> 03:15:42.760]  oppose the abolition of ice this is a losing platform it's just hysteria on steroids at this
[03:15:42.760 --> 03:15:47.000]  point and it's going to backfire it's going to fail so we should be applauding them we should
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:51.880]  be saying they should carry on with this hysterical rhetoric this is the alex joneshow live we'll be

[03:19:59.720 --> 03:20:15.080]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show and now your
[03:20:15.080 --> 03:20:39.400]  host paul joseph watson we're live it is paul's out of the alex jones show we're talking about the reaction the fallout to this scandal this latest scandal there's a new one every week that was supposed to sink the trump administration the border patrol policy the separation of children from their parents we have a new poll out which is a poll of polls an average poll
[03:20:39.400 --> 03:21:01.400]  headline media fail trump's approval rating improved during manufactured border outrage this is by a john nalty over at brightbot president trump's job approval rating improved by five points during the establishment media's manufactured outrage over trump continuing the obama administration's policy of separating illegal alien adults from children at the border
[03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:27.400]  this is real clear politics this is not rasmussen which they say oh that's republican bias even though literally almost every other poll over samples democrats but this is real clear politics poll of polls trump's approval rating rounded out on june 8th trump's approval rating rounded out an average of 42% while its disapproval rating averaged 54% so back on june 8th it was a 12 point gap.
[03:21:27.400 --> 03:21:33.680]  point gap. As of Monday, July the second yesterday, after two weeks of being pounded by the entire
[03:21:33.680 --> 03:21:40.000]  media over border enforcement, Trump's approval rating has climbed to 44% and his disapproval
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:47.800]  rating has dropped to 51% a seven point gap. So the margin between the two has improved
[03:21:47.800 --> 03:21:53.920]  by five points since this scandal, since the scandal they called Trump's Katrina that would
[03:21:53.920 --> 03:22:00.440]  sink his presidency again for the 250th time over the past 18 months. Now it goes on to point
[03:22:00.440 --> 03:22:05.120]  out that when you drill down into this poll, part of that improvement is due to a 10 point
[03:22:05.120 --> 03:22:12.080]  surge in support from Hispanic Americans. And John Nolte goes on to comment, imagine being the
[03:22:12.080 --> 03:22:17.160]  establishment media today, imagine knowing you threw everything you had at the president that
[03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:22.480]  you coordinated a perfect narrative storm using recordings of crying children and hoax photographs,
[03:22:22.480 --> 03:22:27.840]  because obviously if there's an audio tape of a child crying, that must mean we need to raise
[03:22:27.840 --> 03:22:32.400]  the border right and get rid of all laws. Imagine that you poured all your hopes, your dreams and
[03:22:32.400 --> 03:22:38.080]  resources into manufacturing that one bulletproof story that would finally bring this guy down.
[03:22:38.080 --> 03:22:42.840]  And what happened in the end, not only is Trump in better shape now than before this fake news
[03:22:42.840 --> 03:22:48.520]  G had, the public is increasingly siding with him on border and immigration issues. So yeah,
[03:22:48.520 --> 03:22:53.760]  they thought that this would be the one issue to sink Trump. It was a battle of the bulge all
[03:22:53.760 --> 03:23:00.600]  out assault by the media. What happened? Trump came out on top once again. This is why they
[03:23:00.600 --> 03:23:05.520]  seem to be just getting more hysterical, more out of control. And even though it doesn't work,
[03:23:05.520 --> 03:23:11.320]  and anyone from an objective, neutral, a zoomed out perspective can see it's not working. It's
[03:23:11.320 --> 03:23:16.760]  only making swing voters more nervous about voting against Trump, because they say, oh my god,
[03:23:16.760 --> 03:23:22.440]  this is the other option, complete hysteria, complete mad cat behavior every single day,
[03:23:22.440 --> 03:23:27.120]  it's actually helping him. And it's helping him in terms of white millennial men as well.
[03:23:27.120 --> 03:23:34.160]  As this headline out of daily wire discusses, survey finds among white millennial men 23%
[03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:41.800]  move from Dems to GOP in the last two years. So we had the millennial percentage shift,
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:47.680]  which we talked about a couple of months ago, which was 9% Democrats have lost 9% millennial
[03:23:47.680 --> 03:23:55.640]  support since the 2016 election. Now the Guardian reports that a Reuters Ipsos mega poll of 16,000
[03:23:55.640 --> 03:23:59.680]  respondents found that in the last two years support for Democrats among millennials plunged
[03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:07.960]  from 55 to 46% while support for Republicans has only dropped from 28% to 27%. So in the last two
[03:24:07.960 --> 03:24:14.320]  years on top of that support from white millennial men, which of course Democrats have completely
[03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:19.360]  abandoned and basically blamed them for every mass shooting that's happened over the past year,
[03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:24.680]  has gone from the Democrats leading Republicans by 12%, this is again white millennial men,
[03:24:24.680 --> 03:24:32.560]  to the Republicans leading by 11% amongst white millennial men. So you've had a shift of 23%
[03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:39.160]  in support for white millennial men shifting from the Democrat side to the Republican side.
[03:24:39.160 --> 03:24:44.520]  And it's like, are they not reading these polls? Are they not reading about the fact
[03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:50.640]  that what they had a 13, 14 point lead in the race for the House back in December? That's
[03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:56.440]  completely evaporated. So either within the margin of error, or some polls show that Republicans
[03:24:56.440 --> 03:25:01.520]  are now ahead in the race for Congress in the midterms. I mean, are they not reading these
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:06.440]  polls? Do they just think that this endless wall of hysteria, this talk of civil war,
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:11.880]  this talk of confronting getting in the face of Trump supporters and Trump administration
[03:25:11.880 --> 03:25:15.720]  officials, do they think that's actually working? Because it isn't. I'm telling you right now,
[03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:21.080]  it isn't working. None of the polls show it's working. So again, I've talked about this before,
[03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:26.080]  like with the David Hogg issue, for example, people were freaking out back a couple of months
[03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:31.040]  ago, three months ago, about trying to counter David Hogg's narrative. You don't need to count
[03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:38.000]  his narrative. He's the biggest gun salesman of the year, bar none. They're shooting themselves
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:41.960]  in the foot of every available opportunity. They're scoring own goals. Don't interrupt
[03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:47.400]  the enemy when they're making a mistake. And it goes straight to the ICE issue as well.
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:53.800]  We've had Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is now on the rack. Bernie Sanders is too right
[03:25:53.800 --> 03:26:00.040]  wing because he refuses to say that he wants to outright abolish ICE, even as you have
[03:26:00.040 --> 03:26:07.120]  these hard left protesters occupying ICE officers, in some cases, throwing bricks, throwing stones
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:13.080]  at them. This is a headline out of Daily Caller. Abolish ICE vandals throw bricks through
[03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:18.720]  window of GOP office, leave graffiti message. This happened yesterday. Vandals threw a brick
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:22.280]  through the window of the Nebraska Republican Party's headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska
[03:26:22.280 --> 03:26:27.960]  on Monday night. Again, this was abolish ICE protesters. We've had other events, including
[03:26:27.960 --> 03:26:33.640]  one in Philadelphia, which is ongoing right now, last time I checked at least, protest
[03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:38.680]  turned violent as demonstrators arrested in front of Philadelphia ICE building. Protest
[03:26:38.680 --> 03:26:43.560]  turned violent as activists were taken into custody on the streets of Philadelphia today
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:47.200]  as they were calling for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement. The
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:53.520]  protest has taken place in front of the ICE office in Center City. So they're getting
[03:26:53.520 --> 03:26:58.240]  crowded. But again, you go back to the polls, which none of them seem to be looking at.
[03:26:58.240 --> 03:27:03.720]  This is a Harvest Harris poll. Swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats
[03:27:03.720 --> 03:27:10.440]  plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S. Nearly three in four swing voters,
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:16.760]  which is 73% said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30% of swing voters
[03:27:16.760 --> 03:27:22.840]  said they support the abolishment of ICE. It goes on to say even Democrat voters are
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:28.600]  opposed to the abolition of ICE. Nearly 60% of Democrats said they do not want ICE to
[03:27:28.600 --> 03:27:36.960]  be disbanded. So again, every single poll you look at, these policies, this hysteria
[03:27:36.960 --> 03:27:42.960]  is not supported by the majority of the American people or by even really a minority of swing
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:48.680]  voters. This is going to backfire on them horribly. They've lost the gap in terms of
[03:27:48.680 --> 03:27:53.000]  the massive lead they had for the House, for the Congress race, and they've lost it in
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:57.120]  terms of white millennial men. And why do you think it's because every single day the
[03:27:57.120 --> 03:28:03.720]  narrative is to blame white men for everything? In fact, there was a tweet about this where
[03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:08.400]  the individual put up this poll, 23% white millennial men move from Democrats to Republicans.
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:14.800]  Then he had a compilation of every single headline attacking white men as being responsible
[03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:20.400]  for literally every evil on the planet right next to it. The screenshot was literally like
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:26.080]  five images of condensed text that you would have to blow up to a full screen just to see
[03:28:26.080 --> 03:28:32.080]  every single instance of where the mainstream media, of where the hard left had blamed white
[03:28:32.080 --> 03:28:38.120]  men for literally every evil or every imagined evil in their hysterical worldview on the
[03:28:38.120 --> 03:28:42.760]  planet. So that's why they've lost that support. That's why they continue to lose support
[03:28:42.760 --> 03:28:48.240]  amongst everyone, even Hispanics, to the tune of 10% in terms of Trump over the past couple
[03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:53.400]  of weeks. We'll be back. This is the Alex Jones Show live from ForWars.com.

[03:32:15.320 --> 03:32:21.960]  And now we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned
[03:32:21.960 --> 03:32:26.720]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.720 --> 03:32:32.120]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter. And not only were the heavy
[03:32:32.120 --> 03:32:38.200]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As
[03:32:38.200 --> 03:32:43.840]  it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've
[03:32:43.840 --> 03:32:49.400]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more
[03:32:49.400 --> 03:32:57.400]  importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.400 --> 03:33:15.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. News, analysis, reports. It's the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:15.280 --> 03:33:19.280]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:19.280 --> 03:33:26.400]  Well, back it is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. Now, there's a very interesting
[03:33:26.400 --> 03:33:31.760]  article which came out yesterday and it's up on infowars.com. South Koreans revolt against
[03:33:31.760 --> 03:33:35.520]  the arrival of Muslim refugees. Now, this is not really an issue that you hear a lot
[03:33:35.520 --> 03:33:41.240]  out of in terms of Asian countries, because of course, they have very limited, very strict
[03:33:41.240 --> 03:33:47.320]  immigration. But as soon as it came to the fore in terms of 1000 asylum seekers from
[03:33:47.320 --> 03:33:53.960]  Yemen, basically turning up on a South Korean resort island, they absolutely freaked out.
[03:33:53.960 --> 03:34:00.720]  They had 520,000. In fact, this morning, it's probably closer to 600,000 sign of petition.
[03:34:00.720 --> 03:34:04.800]  Over half a million signed a petition asserting that Muslim migrants don't integrate. This
[03:34:04.800 --> 03:34:10.600]  is South Korea and they don't want their country to end up like the UK or Germany. They literally
[03:34:10.600 --> 03:34:15.240]  had signs out on the street saying, we don't want to be like Europe. In fact, I'm probably
[03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:20.280]  going to make a video about this and I'll show you those signs probably tomorrow. But
[03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:24.560]  again, the controversy began when an influx of nearly 1000 asylum seekers from Yemen.
[03:34:24.560 --> 03:34:30.960]  And to be fair, Yemen is in a civil war. So a lot of these people will genuinely be refugees,
[03:34:30.960 --> 03:34:35.640]  but some of them won't, because of course, to afford to get a flight to South Africa
[03:34:35.640 --> 03:34:39.480]  from a country like Yemen, you have to be part of the middle class, really. You have
[03:34:39.480 --> 03:34:45.280]  to be of wealth simply to afford those travel costs. But they arrived on the South Korean
[03:34:45.280 --> 03:34:50.920]  resort island of Jeju because basically the government there or the local government changed
[03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:56.080]  the rules to say you didn't need a visa to go there on holiday. So they turned up as
[03:34:56.080 --> 03:35:02.360]  tourists, around 950 of them, the majority from Yemen. And of course, now that this has
[03:35:02.360 --> 03:35:09.080]  got press attention, you will get others turning up as tourists and abusing the rules to stay
[03:35:09.080 --> 03:35:12.560]  because one month, they get a one month permit when they arrive as tourists, but then they
[03:35:12.560 --> 03:35:18.120]  immediately claim asylum. And of course, that process can take years while they remain in
[03:35:18.120 --> 03:35:23.360]  the country. And as we've seen in numerous other European countries, a sizable portion
[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:29.120]  of these individuals just disappear and you never hear from them again. So they interviewed
[03:35:29.120 --> 03:35:33.080]  somebody called Hank Kim, who was the owner of the core travel agency on that South Korean
[03:35:33.080 --> 03:35:38.520]  resort island. Basically, it's a holiday island. He said the local people here are worried.
[03:35:38.520 --> 03:35:42.120]  We have read all about the problems that immigrants have caused in Europe, in Germany and France
[03:35:42.120 --> 03:35:48.600]  in particular. And we do not want that to happen here. This is one of the locals there.
[03:35:48.600 --> 03:35:52.760]  And he went on to emphasize that the limited amount of Muslim immigration they've had into
[03:35:52.760 --> 03:35:57.960]  South Korea, which is very limited compared to other countries in Europe. He said they
[03:35:57.960 --> 03:36:02.880]  all have big families and they bring their own culture instead of trying to adapt to
[03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:08.000]  the place where they live, which is because we know is true, ghettoization, no go zones
[03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:12.040]  across Europe. It's a common phenomenon. It's no longer denied. They once tried to claim
[03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:17.360]  it was a conspiracy theory. It got so bad. Ambulance crews, firemen were being attacked.
[03:36:17.360 --> 03:36:21.960]  Police were being attacked. Cars were being set on fire. Now they have to admit it's
[03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:27.480]  a reality in Sweden, in Germany, in all these other countries. So South Korea does not want
[03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:34.440]  to be like that. So over 120,000 people signed a petition. It's probably closer to 600,000
[03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:41.120]  now. Opposing the arrival of Muslim refugees, then they had a protest in Seoul on Saturday.
[03:36:41.120 --> 03:36:44.440]  And that's from one of what I was talking about earlier with the signs. Literally they
[03:36:44.440 --> 03:36:49.320]  were carrying signs that said, we don't want refugees. We don't want to be like Europe.
[03:36:49.320 --> 03:36:53.840]  We don't want to be like UK. We don't want to be like Germany. That's what those signs
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:57.680]  mean there that you're seeing right now in Korean. But there are also some in English
[03:36:57.680 --> 03:37:01.920]  off a different video, which I'm going to make a video about tomorrow probably. So they
[03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:07.240]  also interviewed a professor, Song Young-che at the Center for Global Creation and Collaboration
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:13.200]  at Seoul Sangmyeong University, who attended the protest that I just mentioned. He said,
[03:37:13.200 --> 03:37:17.560]  South Koreans wanted to avoid the same crisis that has befallen Europe, who opened their
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:22.480]  borders to European countries who opened their borders to mass Islamic immigration. He said,
[03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:26.400]  quote, you've seen on television just how many problems are caused when a country like
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:31.720]  Germany or the UK is relaxed about immigration and the damage it does to societies. That's
[03:37:31.720 --> 03:37:36.000]  them what you're talking about. In particular, he mentioned pedophile grooming gangs, which
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:39.960]  of course are a huge problem across the UK. They're not dealt with. In many cases, they
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:44.960]  actually arrest the people who blow the whistle on them. And he mentioned terrorism as well
[03:37:44.960 --> 03:37:49.080]  as two negative side effects that South Korea did not want to import. Don't see a lot of
[03:37:49.080 --> 03:37:53.880]  terrorism or at least Islamic terrorism in South Korea, do you? Don't see a lot of Islamic
[03:37:53.880 --> 03:38:01.000]  terrorism in Japan. Gee, I wonder why. Again, it goes back to the argument of, well, it's
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:05.920]  just a minority. Yeah, it only takes a minority. You look at every historical example. I
[03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:10.080]  only takes a minority for the problems to be huge. That's not the argument it never
[03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:16.000]  has been. Now, this view that South Koreans share, and they're obviously, you know, racist
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:20.520]  for doing so, even though they're not white, is also shared by the majority of European
[03:38:20.520 --> 03:38:25.360]  citizens. We've talked about this poll before out of the Royal Institute of International
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:30.120]  Affairs, which is quite ironic because that's a big globalist group, which is probably pushing
[03:38:30.120 --> 03:38:35.600]  for mass immigration. 55% of Europeans, if you ask across the country, some countries,
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:42.160]  more some countries, it's less. But the average is 55% of European citizens support a total
[03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:48.240]  ban on Muslim immigration. The total ban tomorrow on all Muslim immigration, the very thing
[03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:54.600]  that Trump mooted that he suggested during his campaign run, is supported by the majority
[03:38:54.600 --> 03:39:02.800]  of Europeans right now. Now, in South Korea, they had 9,942 people apply for refugee status
[03:39:02.800 --> 03:39:08.320]  last year. This year, that's doubled according to the new statistics because of programs
[03:39:08.320 --> 03:39:15.280]  like I mentioned earlier. But they only allowed 121 people to stay to claim asylum out of
[03:39:15.280 --> 03:39:23.080]  that near 10,000. So unlike European countries who basically accept way too many on quite
[03:39:23.080 --> 03:39:28.720]  dubious merits in a lot of cases, South Korea is saying no. The people of South Korea are
[03:39:28.720 --> 03:39:33.360]  saying no. Over half a million of them signed a petition saying no. And from what I've seen
[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:38.440]  out of this story, it looks like the government is listening. They're going to cancel this
[03:39:38.440 --> 03:39:42.800]  ridiculous thing where you can just turn up as a tourist and then claim asylum on this
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:47.680]  South Korean island and then get shipped to the mainland. Looks like from the noises that
[03:39:47.680 --> 03:39:52.560]  they're making, they're going to stop this program. And South Korea has said no to mass
[03:39:52.560 --> 03:39:57.000]  Islamic immigration. That's not going to be in the news. It was in, it was in Deutsche
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:01.680]  Well, which is a German publication. It was in, I think, the Korea Times. You don't see
[03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:07.080]  any discussion of this in a lot of big Western mainstream media publications, do you? Well
[03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:13.560]  no, because they can't frame it as Islamophobia. They can't frame it as white supremacy or
[03:40:13.560 --> 03:40:21.080]  the far right because it's happening in South Korea. Absolutely fascinating story. But again,
[03:40:21.080 --> 03:40:27.320]  part of the course when it comes to Asian countries, which obviously have very, very
[03:40:27.320 --> 03:40:31.480]  limited skilled immigration, which is what a lot of European countries won. And on that
[03:40:31.480 --> 03:40:38.520]  very subject, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, also anti-immigration alliance across
[03:40:38.520 --> 03:40:44.120]  Europe. Of course, he's the leader of the Liga Party in Italy, which recently came
[03:40:44.120 --> 03:40:49.920]  to power and is basically turning the boats back in Libya, stopping the taxi service, literally
[03:40:49.920 --> 03:40:55.800]  picking them up from 10 miles off the Libyan coast. So he spoke to 50,000 supporters at
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:41:02.440]  the Liga Party Conference recently and said, quote, I think of a league of leagues in Europe,
[03:41:02.440 --> 03:41:06.800]  which unites all the free movements that want to defend their borders and the well-being
[03:41:06.800 --> 03:41:12.360]  of their children. So he's already got common cause in many European countries right now,
[03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:17.120]  including Poland, Austria, Czech Republic, the Visigrad countries. So there really is
[03:41:17.120 --> 03:41:22.600]  a split between the likes of Germany and France, old Europe and Italy. And he's calling for
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:29.160]  that to be to be cemented. As we saw in Germany, where Merkel's Interior Minister basically
[03:41:29.160 --> 03:41:34.160]  revolted against her open border policies, it almost led to the collapse of Merkel's
[03:41:34.160 --> 03:41:38.280]  government. Now they've come to an agreement where they've basically closed the borders
[03:41:38.280 --> 03:41:43.680]  in Germany to a lot of these refugees. So everything is moving in the right direction
[03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:47.720]  in terms of border security and safety for a lot of European countries, which is why
[03:41:47.720 --> 03:41:52.840]  I say on a regular basis, a lot of good news coming out of Europe right now. Not so much
[03:41:52.840 --> 03:41:58.320]  good news coming out of Paris, which is now a complete dump, thieves rip gold teeth from
[03:41:58.320 --> 03:42:04.480]  men's mouth on streets of troubled Paris, no-go zone. Remember back in, I think it was 2015
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:09.800]  after Charlie Hebdo, the mainstream media said, oh, there are no no-go zones in Paris.
[03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:13.980]  What are you talking about? Well, a 37-year-old man was the victim of a brutal attack Friday
[03:42:13.980 --> 03:42:18.920]  night in a Paris suburb. And several people robbed him of his phone and ripped out four
[03:42:18.920 --> 03:42:25.600]  of his gold teeth. Now these teeth are worth about 50 euros each, which is about $58. So
[03:42:25.600 --> 03:42:32.280]  they just ripped out four of his teeth basically so they could get their hands on $200 or less.
[03:42:32.280 --> 03:42:37.600]  Paris is a total dump. They've literally got migrants on the streets, on mattresses, soaring
[03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:43.360]  crime, sexual assaults. They made the wrong decision. Salvini, Italy made the right decision
[03:42:43.360 --> 03:42:47.760]  and hopefully other European countries will do the same. This is the Alex Jones Show Live.

[03:49:38.920 --> 03:49:44.000]  Go for a few final news stories here. Now this story out of the UK Westminster officials
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:49.760]  banned Trump from meeting Nigel Farage during your UK presidential visit. The Prime Minister's
[03:49:49.760 --> 03:49:54.600]  staff organizing next week's working visit are working to prevent President Donald Trump
[03:49:54.600 --> 03:49:59.920]  from having a meeting with Brexit leader Nigel Farage according to claims made Tuesday. Now
[03:49:59.920 --> 03:50:06.600]  they've denied it, but again, we have a situation in the UK where we've got skyrocketing crime,
[03:50:06.600 --> 03:50:11.200]  stabbings, acid attacks. It only seems to be getting worse as the weather gets warmer.
[03:50:11.200 --> 03:50:15.640]  We've got a Brexit deal which the Conservative Government, Conservative in name only, has
[03:50:15.640 --> 03:50:21.320]  basically betrayed, torn up and incinerated the democratic mandate of the British people.
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:25.960]  That's what Theresa May should be concentrating on. Instead, she's apparently according to
[03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:32.280]  this report concentrating on deciding who Nigel Farage can meet in his spare time. No,
[03:50:32.280 --> 03:50:37.720]  stick to what you were elected for, stick to what we voted for back two years ago, stop
[03:50:37.720 --> 03:50:43.240]  posse-footing around, deciding what Nigel Farage and Donald Trump get up to. None in
[03:50:43.240 --> 03:50:48.440]  your business, Donald Trump can meet whoever the hell he wants while he's here in his own
[03:50:48.440 --> 03:50:55.440]  spare private time. Meanwhile, Cameron personally requested Obama's back of the Q Brexit warning.
[03:50:55.440 --> 03:51:00.440]  The former key aide to Barack Obama has confirmed David Cameron, former Prime Minister of Britain
[03:51:00.440 --> 03:51:05.520]  of course, personally asked the US President to warn Britain would be back of the Q for
[03:51:05.520 --> 03:51:11.520]  a post-Brexit trade deal. Ben Rhodes, an ex-White House adviser admitted Mr. Obama's dramatic
[03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:17.480]  intervention in the EU referendum campaign came at the personal request of the former
[03:51:17.480 --> 03:51:24.080]  Prime Minister, which of course happened in April 2016, just two months before the Brexit
[03:51:24.080 --> 03:51:27.960]  vote where Obama gave the speech and said the UK is going to be at the back of the Q.
[03:51:27.960 --> 03:51:33.360]  Well, it turns out that wasn't the case because you lost, Hillary Clinton lost. But again,
[03:51:33.360 --> 03:51:39.400]  what does this tell us? Foreign meddling, interfering with the democratic process. That's
[03:51:39.400 --> 03:51:45.840]  literally what we have here. Actual proof of a foreign power meddling in our sovereign
[03:51:45.840 --> 03:51:51.040]  democratic process. Not talking about Russian collusion, I'm talking about Barack Obama
[03:51:51.040 --> 03:51:57.040]  scheming with David Cameron to meddle in our democratic process in the UK when it came
[03:51:57.040 --> 03:52:04.200]  to Brexit. Bombshell admitted proof of foreign collusion. Is anybody talking about that?
[03:52:04.200 --> 03:52:10.040]  No, no. Nobody's talking about it. They're still talking about this Mueller investigation.
[03:52:10.040 --> 03:52:16.000]  Admitted proof of foreign collusion right there bang in your face. Meanwhile, talking
[03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:20.840]  about Trump, and this ties into Trump because we've got his visit next week in the UK, not
[03:52:20.840 --> 03:52:25.480]  an official state visit because basically the Conservative government is scared that
[03:52:25.480 --> 03:52:29.240]  everyone will freak out, which they will because they're complete idiots. There'll be protests.
[03:52:29.240 --> 03:52:35.680]  There may indeed be small scale riots. But over in Turkey, this ties into it, Istanbul
[03:52:35.680 --> 03:52:42.240]  police shoot rubber bullets and tear gas, sick dogs on gay pride marches in Istanbul.
[03:52:42.240 --> 03:52:47.400]  So they banned the gay pride march again, the 16th annual gay pride march like they did
[03:52:47.400 --> 03:52:53.360]  for the past four years in Istanbul, Turkey. It attracted 100,000 people in 2014. This
[03:52:53.360 --> 03:52:59.240]  year, 10,000 people showed up. In fact, only 1000 showed up. What did they do? They used
[03:52:59.240 --> 03:53:05.160]  tear gas. They used rubber bullets. They used dogs to try to disperse the crowd. Erdogan's
[03:53:05.160 --> 03:53:10.240]  thugs also brought out the police dogs. They broke it up, basically pointed guns at the
[03:53:10.240 --> 03:53:14.720]  protesters. The video's over at Gateway Pundit. If you want to watch it, who's going to be
[03:53:14.720 --> 03:53:22.320]  protesting that? Nobody is the LGBT lobby in London going to march on the Turkish Embassy
[03:53:22.320 --> 03:53:26.680]  in London. No, they're not. They're going to be protesting against Donald Trump, a guy
[03:53:26.680 --> 03:53:33.040]  who literally appoints gay people to high positions of influence within his administration,
[03:53:33.040 --> 03:53:37.040]  as we saw with the ambassador a couple of months ago. They're going to be protesting the guy
[03:53:37.040 --> 03:53:42.600]  who literally waves a rainbow flag around on stage, which happened during his campaign.
[03:53:42.600 --> 03:53:46.920]  Are they going to be protesting against a government, against a belief system that persecutes
[03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:52.960]  gays on a regular basis, that fires tear gas at them, that fires rubber bullets at them,
[03:53:52.960 --> 03:53:58.120]  that six dogs at them simply for trying to get out on the streets and have a parade? No.
[03:53:58.120 --> 03:54:02.040]  They don't give a damn about that. They give a damn about Trump because they've got Trump
[03:54:02.040 --> 03:54:07.920]  derangement syndrome. They're told what to think. Nobody's going to be protesting anti-gay
[03:54:07.920 --> 03:54:12.360]  persecution of people in Istanbul, Turkey. Are they? Nobody's going to be marching on
[03:54:12.360 --> 03:54:18.360]  the Saudi Embassy. Nobody's going to be marching on the Turkish Embassy. Complete hypocrisy
[03:54:18.360 --> 03:54:20.160]  through and through.
[03:54:20.160 --> 03:54:24.920]  Another story out of Breitbart here. In fact, we've got a clip that we can play. This is
[03:54:24.920 --> 03:54:31.600]  the Polish lawmaker clip where he basically takes on Cathy Newman, her of, so what you're
[03:54:31.600 --> 03:54:37.320]  saying is fame with Jordan Peterson, the living meme. He takes her on. Again, she tries to
[03:54:37.320 --> 03:54:43.320]  guilt-trip him for the fact that Poland hasn't accepted huge swaths of refugees, and she
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:45.640]  comes off second best. Let's go to this clip.
[03:54:45.640 --> 03:54:51.880]  Let me ask Mr. Czyszczewski, how many refugees has Poland taken?
[03:54:51.880 --> 03:54:54.760]  Zero.
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:54:56.440]  And you're proud of that?
[03:54:56.440 --> 03:55:05.560]  If you are asking me about Muslims' illegal immigration, none, not even one will come
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:11.200]  to Poland. Not even one if it's illegal. We took over two million Ukrainians who are
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:16.160]  working, who are peaceful in Poland. We will not receive even one Muslim because this is
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:17.160]  what we promised.
[03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:23.720]  But I asked not about illegal immigrants. I asked about refugees. And Junker, the commission
[03:55:23.720 --> 03:55:28.180]  president says that you're racist. Do you sound proud of the fact that you haven't taken
[03:55:28.180 --> 03:55:31.440]  any refugees?
[03:55:31.440 --> 03:55:35.840]  Of course, because this is what our people are expecting from our government. That's
[03:55:35.840 --> 03:55:42.360]  number one. This is why our government was elected. But this is why Poland is so safe.
[03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:48.840]  This is the reason why we have not even one terrorist attack. Look at the streets in Poland.
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:55.600]  And we can be called populists, nationalists, racists. I don't care. I care about my family
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:55:58.000]  and about my country.
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:02.640]  Not many terrorist attacks in Poland, not many giant grooming gangs sweeping the country
[03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:07.480]  in Poland are there. That's interesting, isn't it? And of course, the media, and in that
[03:56:07.480 --> 03:56:12.400]  case, Kathy Newman, use the term refugees when they know they know that even according
[03:56:12.400 --> 03:56:16.920]  to the UN's own figures, the vast majority of these people who they call refugees are
[03:56:16.920 --> 03:56:21.920]  not refugees. They're economic migrants. They can only afford to pay the criminal people
[03:56:21.920 --> 03:56:26.640]  smugglers in the first place because they've at least got some wealth within their own
[03:56:26.640 --> 03:56:31.040]  countries. They're not refugees. They're trying to flee to the European welfare states.
[03:56:31.040 --> 03:56:35.960]  And in fact, in the process, harming their own countries, because a lot of them are essentially
[03:56:35.960 --> 03:56:40.840]  middle class within those countries, and they're fleeing. Absolutely incredible situation.
[03:56:40.840 --> 03:56:45.360]  But the resistance against it is building. Here's a story out of Germany. Thousands
[03:56:45.360 --> 03:56:50.440]  of Germans protest against Merkel and migration in Kotbuss. After several migrant-related
[03:56:50.440 --> 03:56:54.000]  incidents, the people of Kotbuss took to the streets Sunday to protest against Merkel's
[03:56:54.000 --> 03:56:59.480]  migration policy. German community organization processes throughout the city with demonstrators
[03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:05.040]  calling out, Merkel must leave. We are the people and deport.
[03:57:05.040 --> 03:57:09.200]  So there are huge protests going on against this. We have the situation in Italy with
[03:57:09.200 --> 03:57:14.760]  Salvini where him and the five-star movement, the coalition government, are hugely popular
[03:57:14.760 --> 03:57:20.280]  for instituting these measures whereby they at least have some sense of border security
[03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:25.240]  and sovereignty. The populist wave is sweeping Europe. You cannot stop it at this point
[03:57:25.240 --> 03:57:31.960]  by merely invoking the words racist or populist or nationalist. It doesn't work. People have
[03:57:31.960 --> 03:57:36.880]  rejected your globalism, and that rejection is only going to build. I was going to wrap
[03:57:36.880 --> 03:57:40.360]  it up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show. War Room with Owen Shroyer is coming
[03:57:40.360 --> 03:57:47.400]  up live in fourwars.com. Don't go away. Patrick, in the great nation of Australia,
[03:57:47.400 --> 03:57:50.480]  we're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[03:57:50.480 --> 03:57:55.880]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now. I remember back when Infowars
[03:57:55.880 --> 03:58:00.640]  and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the
[03:58:00.640 --> 03:58:04.560]  page on my dial-up into there, and I thought it was pretty cool. And read all the books
[03:58:04.560 --> 03:58:08.680]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests, and I've been using your products
[03:58:08.680 --> 03:58:13.520]  since the first iteration of Survival Shield. And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super
[03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:19.000]  Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body. It's all amazing.
[03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:20.000]  Thank you, brother.
[03:58:20.000 --> 03:58:24.680]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[03:58:24.680 --> 03:58:29.080]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more
[03:58:29.080 --> 03:58:34.200]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God. And I wanted to say that
[03:58:34.200 --> 03:58:39.520]  it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776
[03:58:39.520 --> 03:58:46.520]  World War.
[03:59:09.520 --> 03:59:15.200]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[03:59:15.200 --> 03:59:20.280]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[03:59:20.280 --> 03:59:26.160]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:59:26.160 --> 03:59:31.720]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[03:59:31.720 --> 03:59:34.960]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[03:59:34.960 --> 03:59:42.520]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance
[03:59:42.520 --> 03:59:46.800]  and we are winning.
[03:59:46.800 --> 04:00:06.480]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
