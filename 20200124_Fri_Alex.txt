[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Oh
[00:30.000 --> 00:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, young broadcasting world-wide. I'm not supposed to be on the air right now when the globalists make their move to establish world government using manufactured biological crises.
[00:51.000 --> 01:00.000]  We've been predicting this for a long time. My film in-game blueprint for global enslavement lays out this exact scenario we're now witnessing.
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  Big article was written last night that we're printing right now.
[01:05.000 --> 01:25.000]  Michael McBreen at infowars.com laying all this out. We're going to be breaking it down here today, but first here's a very important report that we have just showing more of how the mainstream media is completely deceptive by design. I know that's really rhetorical, but still some are not aware of this fact.
[01:25.000 --> 01:39.000]  I do not support in any way shape or form Governor Northam's and the Democrats' gun control. What I also don't support is the fact that every news piece you've seen on this weekend, they've always brought up the issue of race.
[01:39.000 --> 01:50.000]  Congressman Virginia is on high alert this morning before a gun rights rally that local authorities fear could turn violent. We're seeing threats of violence. Virginia's governor has declared a state of emergency.
[01:50.000 --> 02:10.000]  We're seeing threats of armed confrontation and assault on our country. Now armed gun rights supporters from across the country, including some from the far right, are planning to sweep into Richmond on Martin Luther King Day.
[02:10.000 --> 02:21.000]  White supremacists are crawling the nation that all gun owners are racist and that people are planning to kill law enforcement in Virginia when conservatives and patriots have never even acted like that at a gun rally before.
[02:21.000 --> 02:37.000]  The neo-nazi group that advocates violence against minorities, far right extremists, neo-nazis, several hate groups, militia groups, these militia groups, far right militias, militia groups, white supremacist groups, white supremacists, white supremacist groups, white supremacist groups, white nationalist groups.
[02:37.000 --> 02:49.000]  They want to paint Trump supporters as neo-nazis, white supremacists.
[02:49.000 --> 03:03.000]  As though it's nothing but white, red nicks and hillbillies out here who care for the Second Amendment would actually black Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Americans in general, who care about the Second Amendment.
[03:03.000 --> 03:14.000]  These white politicians in leftist run cities want to take away black women's rights to protect ourselves.
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  That's what they do. It's like a mascot. They put you in front and then they run their agenda.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  When you look at the history of gun control, it was used to take away guns from minorities and the black men and women who just wanted to protect their family.
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  If anything, you would want black men and women to be able to protect their families from anybody trying to break in.
[03:35.000 --> 03:43.000]  It all started with them taking away our guns. You can't protect yourself. It's fine for the police to protect you, but what if they can't get to you fast enough?
[03:43.000 --> 03:53.000]  Much of gang members storming into a jewelry store shot your fire right there. The woman behind the counter opened fire. Who are they running back?
[03:53.000 --> 04:01.000]  Listen, if they steamroll the Second Amendment, they'll steamroll everything else. Simply, we just want to hold on to our rights to protect ourselves.
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.000]  We're definitely here to show this unity because the media will play and act like we don't deal with each other very well.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  We won't come together, but you can look around and not see people from all walks of life today.
[04:11.000 --> 04:19.000]  I'm here because I love this country and if the Democrats are able to do away with the Constitution, a temporary ban on the Constitution, come on.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  Never heard of. Everyone should be terrified of that.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  You need to be prepared to protect what's yours at all times.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  United, we stay. Right. Right.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  White, black, Hispanic, Latino, Mexican, whatever. United, we stay.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  Are you willing to lay down your life to protect the Second Amendment and your right to carry?
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  Definitely. Why wouldn't I be? I mean, that'd be the perfect thing to give my life up for. Something my family would be honored about.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  I'd love to, Doc. I'm for you.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  Would you be willing to lay down your life to protect the Second Amendment and your right to carry?
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  Absolutely.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  That's what I'm of you.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[05:25.000 --> 05:50.000]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.000]  All part of the fight. Info Wars. Brought to you by you.
[06:25.000 --> 06:40.000]  The Weimar government passed a government registration law in the name of public safety.
[06:40.000 --> 06:49.000]  After Adolf Hitler seized power, the registration list was used to disarm the Jews and political opponents of the Nazi Party.
[06:49.000 --> 06:58.000]  The Communist Party decreed that the people surrender all their weapons and later surrender their knives.
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  20 million people were killed.
[07:03.000 --> 07:13.000]  Mao Tse Tung said that the government must command all the guns so that no guns can ever be used to command the party.
[07:13.000 --> 07:26.000]  65 million were killed.
[07:26.000 --> 07:34.000]  After America gained independence, the people were bestowed with the Second Amendment to defend their freedoms from tyranny.
[07:34.000 --> 07:46.000]  The founders would have likely found the Federal Reserve Bank alone to be despotic, let alone the deep-rooted corruption and tyranny we are steeped in today.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  Today, there is open talk of gun confiscation.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15.
[07:52.000 --> 08:00.000]  When the governor of Virginia threatened to strip his people of their constitutional right, over 22,000 people showed up to protest.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  16,000 were armed to the teeth.
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  The spirit of the Second Amendment has nothing to do with sport.
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.000]  It is an equalizing force for the individual soul which thrives only in a free society.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  And the only people who want to take it away are tyrants and fools.
[08:20.000 --> 08:27.000]  Virginia was a victory, but the swamp runs deep and the danger is real.
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  A pivotal year like 2020 comes only once in a lifetime, and we all need to give it everything we have.
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  The leading Democratic candidate has been staffing violent radicals, calling for a communist revolution in America.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  Whether or not their candidate wins.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  Trump gets reelected what?
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  The city's burned.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  The time to act is now.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  Help yourself and help your family.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  Support the InfoWar at infowarstore.com.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  And we will continue to fight for individual freedom and the spirit of 1776.
[09:04.000 --> 09:12.000]  1776 will commence again if you don't back down.
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  You will not take away our firearms and you will not silence us.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to SCUM.
[09:40.000 --> 09:50.000]  And the Russian SCUM.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  Listen, please listen.
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.000]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  The function of all life is survival.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  Sleep, sleep, sleep.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  Oh my God, oh my God.
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  Lock the door.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  We're coming.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  Help, help. They're coming.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  They're coming. Listen to me.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  Listen.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  Please, you're next.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  They're in danger. Please listen to me.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  Something terrible.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  You're next.
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  You're next. We're coming. We're coming.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  Sleep. The seed is planted.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  Sleep.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  Terror grows.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  Elizabeth, wake up.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  Get you when you sleep.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  Sit up.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  Is it contagious?
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  It's a real homies.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  It looked right after you.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  You need to get out.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  I'm not human.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  We're being cornered.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  The barricading streak.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  No land also wants me dead.
[11:20.000 --> 11:30.000]  No land also wants me dead.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  No land also wants me dead.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[11:40.000 --> 11:50.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  Therapists in the U.S. say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients with what they call
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  Donald Trump anxiety disorder.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  Trump anxiety disorder.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  Trump derangement syndrome.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  Trump derangement syndrome is clinically real.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  It doesn't merely affect individuals,
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  but entire political parties rendering them unrecognizable.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  One minute, they're perfectly normal.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  The next, rapid.
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  Families and culture are collapsing.
[12:36.000 --> 12:44.000]  And godless leftists are behaving just like zombies of modern law.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  You can't trust your mother.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Get the hell out of here.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  Get the fuck out of here.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  Your best friend.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  The neighbor next door.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  Psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman says for his clients, it started the morning after the election.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  Doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump anxiety disorder.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  A number of people are manifesting what I would call post-Trumpmatic stress disorder.
[13:10.000 --> 13:20.000]  An overpowering fear that President Trump represents the end of the world.
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  Pray, it doesn't happen to you.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  Let's not get dead.
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  Rev it.
[13:34.000 --> 14:00.000]  White males.
[14:00.000 --> 14:12.000]  You think you're going to assassinate Trump.
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.840]  Now, it's time for me to be willing to have a fight, one at one, at this point.
[14:15.840 --> 14:21.340]  And only the dumbest morons buying to your SJW Globalist George Soros' droppings.
[14:21.340 --> 14:21.840]  Stabilize it.
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.000]  So George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and the new world order of Michael Moore,
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.240]  go back to Hades, where you came from.
[14:29.240 --> 14:32.800]  We're awake, and you're not putting us back in the coma.
[14:32.800 --> 14:34.240]  You got that, Jack?
[14:34.240 --> 14:36.000]  You're done! It's over!
[14:36.000 --> 14:36.840]  Worldwide!
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.840]  Get him back! Get him back!
[14:44.840 --> 14:49.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[14:59.840 --> 15:01.840]  I don't want to interrupt, but I'm leaving.
[15:01.840 --> 15:09.840]  You've been doing great, Owen. You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's and, of course, Harrison Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[15:09.840 --> 15:14.840]  The crews volunteered to do it, so we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[15:14.840 --> 15:16.840]  So the live coverage continues. Everybody spread those links.
[15:16.840 --> 15:20.840]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down. Don't let them win. No BS.
[15:20.840 --> 15:22.840]  I'm going to tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[15:22.840 --> 15:24.840]  See, I don't have some Mackie Valley manipulative view.
[15:24.840 --> 15:28.840]  With me, it's all straightforward attack. That's the real power!
[15:28.840 --> 15:32.840]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[15:32.840 --> 15:36.840]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[15:36.840 --> 15:40.840]  Join Band-Aught Video, and I will complete your training.
[15:40.840 --> 15:44.840]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[15:44.840 --> 16:05.840]  I'm here with Scott Yousseam, founder of OMG Tax. Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:05.840 --> 16:12.840]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments, sometimes in the same day.
[16:12.840 --> 16:17.840]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:17.840 --> 16:20.840]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.840 --> 16:27.840]  Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what?
[16:27.840 --> 16:32.840]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[16:32.840 --> 16:42.840]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[16:42.840 --> 16:56.840]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112. That's 800-486-8112.
[16:56.840 --> 17:02.840]  If you are trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and will never meet.
[17:02.840 --> 17:12.840]  I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:12.840 --> 17:17.840]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:17.840 --> 17:25.840]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:25.840 --> 17:32.840]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[17:58.840 --> 18:07.840]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4s, the family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air.
[18:07.840 --> 18:17.840]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul reveres.
[18:17.840 --> 18:24.840]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[18:24.840 --> 18:29.840]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[18:29.840 --> 18:33.840]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[18:33.840 --> 18:39.840]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[18:39.840 --> 18:43.840]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[18:43.840 --> 18:54.840]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[18:54.840 --> 18:58.840]  So visit infowarsstore.com today.
[18:58.840 --> 19:06.840]  We have been fighting so hard in the last two weeks that I've not even had time to cut new audio ads for this huge syndicated radio audience.
[19:06.840 --> 19:14.840]  And I apologize to the radio listeners, I apologize to the fact I'm cutting this on a phone as I drive down the road, but this is a war and we're getting it done anyway we can.
[19:14.840 --> 19:21.840]  But we had huge sales in the new year, around Christmas end of the new year.
[19:21.840 --> 19:28.840]  But we sold the products at such low prices that it didn't bring in a lot of actual capital to fund our operations.
[19:28.840 --> 19:38.840]  We're spending massive amounts of money to put more than 15 people in Virginia, more than 10 people in B.C. all next week for the trial of Trump.
[19:38.840 --> 19:43.840]  It's so critical we're there to confront the globalist and put out the counter narrative of the truth to what they're doing.
[19:43.840 --> 19:45.840]  This is a real fight.
[19:45.840 --> 19:50.840]  So please step to the plate and take care of yourself and your family and get great products while you do it.
[19:50.840 --> 20:00.840]  Get them forward store.com. These are products you need, like the ultimate fish oil, and if funds the operation, please take action. Get them forward store.com.
[20:20.840 --> 20:47.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I went ahead and aired some special reports and some old pieces we put together,
[20:47.840 --> 20:58.840]  likening the left to a court of zombies, because I thought it would really set the tone for the rot that we have spreading across the planet.
[20:58.840 --> 21:16.840]  The rot of aimlessness, the rot of people living hypnotized, watching entertainment all day, the rot of IQs dropping and brainwaves dropping and every indicator being that humanity is in the process of dying right now.
[21:16.840 --> 21:28.840]  Now, humanity is in the process of waking up to the fact that we're being sucked into a spiritual, physical, cultural, environmental woodchipper.
[21:28.840 --> 21:41.840]  But reading all the news and all the information, this is probably one of the first times that I just physically could not go on air at the start of the broadcast.
[21:41.840 --> 21:50.840]  And, you know, there really just comes a time when the world's just going to have to be judged.
[21:50.840 --> 21:57.840]  And if I tell you what I really think about things, it's because I respect you.
[21:57.840 --> 22:25.840]  We're not going to get away with aborting billions of babies and not valuing human life and watching China, the model of where people don't value human life, and watch that become the global standard for multinational corporations who are beyond solace and not have a total collapse of civilization.
[22:25.840 --> 22:31.840]  And so that's where all this is going.
[22:31.840 --> 22:46.840]  Just a few weeks ago, we had an image up on screen, maybe later we'll put it up, but it was of an astronaut standing in the middle of a U.S. forest.
[22:46.840 --> 23:01.840]  People said, oh, what a pretty photo, but they missed the point. It was a world made uninhabitable for humans.
[23:01.840 --> 23:29.840]  A 12-monkeys scenario, because if you look at that image we put together, it shows particular in the air, alien particular that was created artificially that made the world uninhabitable for humans.
[23:29.840 --> 23:48.840]  And now they're driving around in China with giant fumigators pumping out chemicals, hoping to kill the virus, and the government is using it for a police state authoritarian enforcement drill.
[23:48.840 --> 24:14.840]  And, you know, really the big takeaway from this is info wars, analyzing the globalist program, has absolutely with films and articles and guest and PowerPoint presentations, thousands of times detailed exactly what you see beginning to unfold in China with the coronavirus.
[24:14.840 --> 24:25.840]  And the fact that Billa Melinda Gates a few months ago had a big drill for something similar to this that would kill 65 million people starting in China.
[24:25.840 --> 24:38.840]  And people being put in these containment pods and being wheeled away, and that this would be used in Billa Melinda Gates Foundation's own words.
[24:38.840 --> 24:51.840]  Here's the article right here by Kelly McBrain to bring in world government.
[24:51.840 --> 25:20.840]  And, you know, I made a film a long time ago. Time sure flies. I guess 13 years ago called in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[25:20.840 --> 25:30.840]  And what's it say on the back, they want you dead.
[25:30.840 --> 25:35.840]  And I explain everything in the film and it's a three hour film.
[25:35.840 --> 25:50.840]  And we sold a couple hundred thousand copies of it. I put it out for free on Google video. And it got over 50 million views on there before Google got rid of Google video.
[25:50.840 --> 26:10.840]  And it's got about 10 million views on different platforms on YouTube. But the point is, is that if you watch this 13 year old film, it lays out how they would use contrived bio crises, epidemics to bring in world government.
[26:10.840 --> 26:20.840]  Now I didn't need a crystal ball to see that. They said they'd do that.
[26:20.840 --> 26:36.840]  And just remember the same Bill Gates secretly meeting with none other than Jeffrey Epstein running a quote secret alternative world government project.
[26:36.840 --> 26:45.840]  That's the Wall Street Journal. And what's interesting is there's a big article out today. I got a lot of calls on it because it's in the physical paper.
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.840]  I guess on the front page of the business section.
[26:50.840 --> 27:03.840]  And it says Amazon Prime video gives amateur how to conspiracy theories a stage.
[27:03.840 --> 27:14.840]  And it goes on to say, Oh, questionable films. You can't have a book or a film. It's questionable in the marketplace. Just not allowed somebody up there says no.
[27:14.840 --> 27:23.840]  So it says Amazon took down the Alex Jones film in game for violating community standards.
[27:23.840 --> 27:28.840]  Now when you watch in game, it's all their words. They're playing.
[27:28.840 --> 27:40.840]  They're smart cities, their control grids. And then the bio crises will trigger each one bigger than the last as the news titans around your throat for world government.
[27:40.840 --> 27:43.840]  And how they say they'll use it for world government.
[27:43.840 --> 27:46.840]  Pretty important information.
[27:46.840 --> 27:50.840]  And the film starts out exposing Hitler and eugenics.
[27:50.840 --> 27:59.840]  And those organizations sterilizing poor white people and blacks in America. And that's a ski experiment.
[27:59.840 --> 28:06.840]  And so that's what violates community standards. Now you see, because the film's too powerful.
[28:06.840 --> 28:12.840]  Even the Wall Street Journal says yes, it convinced the people that watched it who didn't even know what it was.
[28:12.840 --> 28:15.840]  They thought they were looking for the Avengers in game.
[28:15.840 --> 28:18.840]  But why is this so important?
[28:18.840 --> 28:20.840]  Why was it taken down?
[28:20.840 --> 28:28.840]  Well, it was taken down for a lot of reasons, but you see, this film inspired the Avengers in game.
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.840]  I mean, I talked to the people involved. They contacted me.
[28:33.840 --> 28:38.840]  They said, oh, you're gonna really like this movie. It's about exterminating everybody.
[28:38.840 --> 28:41.840]  That's about killing everyone. Genocide.
[28:41.840 --> 28:48.840]  So see, you make a film, it inspires a movie by the same name, and it inspires Dave Mustaine albums, everything else.
[28:48.840 --> 28:55.840]  And then it gets taken down for a thought crime.
[28:55.840 --> 29:15.840]  We'll be right back.
[29:26.840 --> 29:30.840]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature.

[30:57.840 --> 31:01.840]  Knock on wood. I am not tempting fate.
[31:01.840 --> 31:09.840]  But everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[31:09.840 --> 31:13.840]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement.
[31:13.840 --> 31:18.840]  I'm not tempting fate. I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[31:18.840 --> 31:22.840]  I'm very thankful for the good Lord, for the Constitution I've been given.
[31:22.840 --> 31:32.840]  But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products in Force Life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[31:32.840 --> 31:36.840]  And, you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[31:36.840 --> 31:44.840]  But now that I religiously take the products at InfoWars Life, one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there,
[31:44.840 --> 31:48.840]  I just never get a fever anymore.
[31:48.840 --> 31:54.840]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy.
[31:54.840 --> 31:57.840]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[31:57.840 --> 32:07.840]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[32:07.840 --> 32:14.840]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[32:14.840 --> 32:19.840]  But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[32:19.840 --> 32:30.840]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[32:30.840 --> 32:40.840]  Anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[32:40.840 --> 32:49.840]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you
[32:49.840 --> 32:55.840]  like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[32:55.840 --> 33:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:25.840 --> 33:41.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:41.840 --> 33:52.840]  So the Corona virus that's been patented by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sub directive and the real life umbrella corporation
[33:52.840 --> 34:01.840]  had a drill three months ago where 60 plus million people died when a Corona like virus hits out and spreads destruction around the world.
[34:01.840 --> 34:15.840]  But don't worry, in the drill, out of it comes the understanding of planetary government and world forced inoculation programs.
[34:15.840 --> 34:41.840]  Now, we've been reporting this since last week and we've been having experts on like Mike Adams and many others and playing you historical clips of the co inventor of the polio vaccine admitting that they knew it had SV 40 in it that causes cancer and leukemia cancer virus.
[34:41.840 --> 34:47.840]  Did you know chickens come from eggs fertilized eggs.
[34:47.840 --> 34:51.840]  Raindrops come from clouds.
[34:51.840 --> 34:57.840]  But did you know that almost all cancer comes from viruses.
[34:57.840 --> 35:06.840]  And that that's well known in the scientific field of urology for about 80 years.
[35:06.840 --> 35:11.840]  They were injecting rats.
[35:11.840 --> 35:14.840]  That's 100 years.
[35:14.840 --> 35:27.840]  Back in the 1920s they had certified studies of injecting viruses from rats that had tumors into other rats and growing the same tumor and they had discovered that it was viral.
[35:27.840 --> 35:35.840]  And I could play you the top scientists admitting that late yesterday.
[35:35.840 --> 35:42.840]  But you see, that's too real, isn't it.
[35:42.840 --> 35:50.840]  When I tell people there's cancer viruses in those vaccines they go cancer doesn't come from viruses.
[35:50.840 --> 35:56.840]  It's like saying dying from bullet wounds doesn't come from bullets.
[35:56.840 --> 36:05.840]  Again, this little spike I have here stuff spike they'd use the old days when a horseman in armor fell down.
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.840]  They had lots of ground troops running around with a with a hammer and a spike.
[36:10.840 --> 36:16.840]  And you hammer this through the armor into their heart.
[36:16.840 --> 36:24.840]  Now see, if I walked up and I stabbed you in the heart with this.
[36:24.840 --> 36:31.840]  They'd say how did the person die well a big spike got driven through their heart.
[36:31.840 --> 36:40.840]  But when you die of cancer or your mommy dies of cancer or your daddy dies of cancer or your son or daughter while we don't know all the kids are getting all this cancer.
[36:40.840 --> 36:48.840]  When that happens, no one's ever going to say oh it was viral cancer.
[36:48.840 --> 36:55.840]  You can get it from radiation to breaking up the DNA chains and causing mutations.
[36:55.840 --> 37:01.840]  And you can get it because you've gotten old and they've divided so many times the telomeres start having malfunctions.
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.840]  But the main cause of cancer it's not disputed in just mainline textbooks.
[37:06.840 --> 37:11.840]  Everyone that goes to school for medicine knows that.
[37:11.840 --> 37:14.840]  But see, you're not supposed to know that.
[37:14.840 --> 37:18.840]  You're just supposed to be told oh our genetics are all breaking down.
[37:18.840 --> 37:25.840]  That's why cancers tens of thousands of times more common in children, thousands and thousands of times more common in adults.
[37:25.840 --> 37:30.840]  It's all a fact because we're being murdered with it.
[37:30.840 --> 37:46.840]  And I played the co developer of the sock vaccine saying they knew they were injecting Americans and Russians as part of a Carnegie endowment for medicine and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[37:46.840 --> 37:59.840]  And the UN and good little Russians and good little Americans rolled their sleeves up and all took the same one and died later down the road.
[37:59.840 --> 38:03.840]  And now China is part of the World Health Organization, this whole thing.
[38:03.840 --> 38:08.840]  You know, we played this few weeks ago, the head of the UN Science Board saying we're giving people death.
[38:08.840 --> 38:13.840]  We're killing people. We're covering it up.
[38:13.840 --> 38:24.840]  But then you try to post that video on YouTube of them at their official conference in Switzerland, Geneva, Switzerland.
[38:24.840 --> 38:30.840]  For the World Health Organization's based in their official chambers.
[38:30.840 --> 38:33.840]  And YouTube says it violates community standards.
[38:33.840 --> 38:46.840]  Just like my film exposing the eugenicist and Hitler, my anti Nazi film, a real anti Nazi film, want to know where they came from, who they work for, what their plan is, what their end game is.
[38:46.840 --> 38:56.840]  Jeff Bezos's Amazon says you don't get to stream that and watch it even though it had been on there six, seven years. This is a 13 year old film.
[38:56.840 --> 39:02.840]  Because it's too powerful. It's too accurate. It's too real.
[39:02.840 --> 39:09.840]  So we can open the phones up. We can take calls. We've got Mike Adams coming on.
[39:09.840 --> 39:17.840]  Owen's court hearing is in about 20 minutes if it's on time in DC. So I would guess the next hour we'll have Norm Pattis, my lawyer that's there with him.
[39:17.840 --> 39:25.840]  And Owen on the broadcast arrested for wearing tape across his mouth inside the Senate foyer.
[39:25.840 --> 39:30.840]  Not in any of the Senate buildings. Everybody else was allowed to hold up signs and do stuff and yell and scream.
[39:30.840 --> 39:38.840]  But he can't because, well, they ordered the police to arrest him and they follow orders.
[39:38.840 --> 39:47.840]  It's like sock says to the scientists and they had the interview to PBS in Boston. That's what we heard yesterday.
[39:47.840 --> 39:51.840]  He asked sock. He said, well, this is terrible.
[39:51.840 --> 40:02.840]  He said, well, we're not going to stop the efficacy of vaccines. This is all just obfuscation. Besides, there's too many Russians.
[40:02.840 --> 40:11.840]  And the scientist goes, but we killed Americans too. And he goes.
[40:11.840 --> 40:20.840]  And then when you read the Carnegie Endowment, it talks about how the two groups that the globalists were threatened in the British Empire model that set it up.
[40:20.840 --> 40:26.840]  It was going to be Americans and Russians that if they ever got together, that could be a force with the land bridge and all over the world.
[40:26.840 --> 40:37.840]  And with American ingenuity and the Russian ingenuity and all the borders that Russia has with the world that teamed up with Russia, the United States would be able to set its system up worldwide.
[40:37.840 --> 40:49.840]  So the globalists sent in 100,000 former Russians, a lot of Jewish Russians, and overthrew the Tsar.
[40:49.840 --> 40:57.840]  And then you know what happened over in Russia and the tens of millions tortured to death and murdered. And the Christians killed. And the same leftist groups and systems are here today.
[40:57.840 --> 41:04.840]  And they plan to do it again. But the globalists don't like stand up fights. So they're going to kill you and your children.
[41:04.840 --> 41:07.840]  They're going to put fluoride in your water that even foxes, it's deadly poison.
[41:07.840 --> 41:14.840]  And they're going to shoot you up with vaccines with time released viruses and mutated and things way more advanced.
[41:14.840 --> 41:19.840]  What they used to do. And you're going to like it. And you're going to pay them all your money while you die.
[41:19.840 --> 41:26.840]  And then you're going to go bury you and yourself and your family. And you're going to salute the new world order.
[41:26.840 --> 41:40.840]  There's the Fox News article. You scroll down it says fluoridated poisons because they call over 300 poisons fluoride under U.S. law when they dump it in the water.
[41:40.840 --> 41:52.840]  And this 110 million Americans at least affected toxic levels thousands of times what they thought that they're not allowed to count fluoridated poisons under the law.
[41:52.840 --> 42:01.840]  So as long as you mix lead and mercury and arsenic and anything else you want with liquid acid called hydrofluorosalic acid, it binds with it.
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.840]  And then by definition, whatever's in the cocktails called fluoride.
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.840]  It's a good gift to you and your family. Cancer, low IQ, low sperm count to form children.
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.840]  But it's liberal and Tim Cook's gay, so it's okay.
[42:17.840 --> 42:24.840]  As long as Tim Cook's gay, it's A-okay. He can have slave factories, forest abortions in China.
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.840]  He can work with the Chinese Communist government, the big world government project.
[42:27.840 --> 42:33.840]  They're all part of the one child policy, but he wears a nice little bow tie at the Golden Globe.
[42:33.840 --> 42:42.840]  And so it's okay. It's so liberal.
[42:42.840 --> 42:52.840]  So take your vaccine and get ready to see pretty colors and get ready to get stuck in a box six feet under.
[42:52.840 --> 43:04.840]  Oh, but again, it's liberal, so it's okay.
[43:22.840 --> 43:28.840]  Or you can get the nascent iodine pack with survival shield X2 and X3 for 50% off each bottle.
[43:28.840 --> 43:33.840]  Ultimate fish oil and prostagard are both back after months of waiting as well for 35% off.
[43:33.840 --> 43:39.840]  These products are hard to source at the quality we demand, so we don't know how long they'll last. Make sure you get yours today.
[43:39.840 --> 43:46.840]  If supplements aren't your thing, we have storeable food supplies for up to 50% off, as well as water and air filter units for 30% off.
[43:46.840 --> 43:49.840]  There's never going to be a better time to support the Info Wars team.
[43:49.840 --> 43:56.840]  Show Owen, David, Alex, Savannah, and everyone else behind the scenes. You stand with them in the fight against tyranny today.
[43:56.840 --> 44:02.840]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks.
[44:02.840 --> 44:09.840]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[44:09.840 --> 44:13.840]  You know what? I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[44:13.840 --> 44:22.840]  And that's why Info Wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist.
[44:22.840 --> 44:28.840]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[44:28.840 --> 44:36.840]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[44:36.840 --> 44:45.840]  For bottom my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Info Wars, I want to thank you all because you are the Info War, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[44:45.840 --> 45:07.840]  You have made history. We have made history together. InfoWars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[45:16.840 --> 45:25.840]  And our live coverage of the attempt to remove the president in the Senate trial and the deep state trying to trigger a civil emergency in Virginia.
[45:25.840 --> 45:39.840]  We've got our teams on the ground. We'll be covering all of it, but the only way we're able to put the truth out is you magnifying it by sharing the links from band.video and newswars.com forward slash show.
[45:39.840 --> 45:53.840]  And band.video. We have a whole live Trump trial and Virginia coverage page. And as the latest live feeds go up, or as the latest reports go up, they're posted right there at band.video.
[45:53.840 --> 46:10.840]  So click that link and share it. It's a revolutionary act and it's powerful.

[47:01.840 --> 47:09.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:09.840 --> 47:28.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.840 --> 47:38.840]  So you can make the argument that there are too many people and that humans, when they're given a industrial lifestyle, become decadent and stupid.
[47:38.840 --> 47:45.840]  But the facts are, the technocrats running things are the most inbred, psychotic control freaks.
[47:45.840 --> 47:55.840]  And are the worst examples of humans on this planet. Historically speaking and from every other perspective, you can look at.
[47:55.840 --> 48:07.840]  And they use the excuse of being guardians of the earth that have to do all these terrible, horrible things for the good of it as the pretext to just carry out psychotic activity.
[48:07.840 --> 48:15.840]  And their real worldview is that they're going to be super scientists that discover the secrets of the universe.
[48:15.840 --> 48:23.840]  And that they'll be able to transcend their human form, merge with silicon, become gods and build unlimited worlds.
[48:23.840 --> 48:35.840]  And that the planet is nothing but a yoke or nothing but energy from which they will spring an egg.
[48:35.840 --> 48:44.840]  And with some truth to that, the planet is a launch point for humans given to us by God to work with and to build with as a test.
[48:44.840 --> 48:57.840]  But they're cutting off humanity from their destiny and from their real potential so that the establishment can steal the future and try to control it for themselves.
[48:57.840 --> 49:08.840]  And really at the end of the day, that's the end game. That's what it's all about. And that's who they are. And that's who they say they are in thousands of articles, books and statements.
[49:08.840 --> 49:17.840]  But compendium of the publicness of this anti-human, post-human project is staggering.
[49:17.840 --> 49:30.840]  People ask me, how do I take the daily attacks and lies and for whatever you see happening in force, there's probably ten times more happening beneath the surface.
[49:30.840 --> 49:39.840]  Well, because I realize that we're all under attack and that giving into this system is the surest way to be destroyed.
[49:39.840 --> 49:46.840]  And so our only hope is to stand strong and try to alert people as best we can. And you know, I believe in humanity.
[49:46.840 --> 49:53.840]  We've put out the warnings. People have responded because you think just like I do and you believe in humanity as well.
[49:53.840 --> 50:05.840]  But I've got to tell you, Bill and Melinda Gates and the UN, this whole globalist project, their fingerprints aren't just all over this coronavirus.
[50:05.840 --> 50:16.840]  Their response, their preparation, their patenting of it, just everything they do and their previous statements use outbreaks to force world government.
[50:16.840 --> 50:24.840]  And their nefarious activities with Jeffrey Epstein, blackmailing and buying off the scientific community, this is a eugenics call.
[50:24.840 --> 50:31.840]  And how do they get all the scientists on board? They recruit them, they give them money, they give them power and then they compromise them.
[50:31.840 --> 50:49.840]  And Jeffrey Epstein was a front man for the science program of the globalist and the science officer, Bill Gates, as far as my research can tell, is the planetary head of the operation.
[50:49.840 --> 50:58.840]  He's the chief dude. He's the man.
[50:58.840 --> 51:04.840]  He runs the whole thing.
[51:04.840 --> 51:07.840]  And that's it.
[51:07.840 --> 51:14.840]  And his daddy was one of the chief science officers of the program.
[51:14.840 --> 51:16.840]  Look it up.
[51:16.840 --> 51:22.840]  Bill Gates has been on PBS and talked about how we need to depopulate the earth.
[51:22.840 --> 51:31.840]  It's come out that they have secret meetings at universities with Epstein, just as the manager, with all these billionaires to talk about how to depopulate people.
[51:31.840 --> 51:41.840]  And then he's patented through a subgroup, this coronavirus, and then you see the response and they have a tabletop exercise three months ago of killing 60-something million people.
[51:41.840 --> 51:47.840]  And then they go, that's okay, because it brings in world government.
[51:47.840 --> 51:49.840]  So here's the deal.
[51:49.840 --> 51:54.840]  I could have sold out to these people a long time ago when it's off record.
[51:54.840 --> 51:56.840]  I have off record meetings with some of these people.
[51:56.840 --> 51:58.840]  I don't talk about specifically who I talk to.
[51:58.840 --> 52:08.840]  John Harman heard the head of the Kissinger group in a phone call because he was on during breaks telling me you need to join us.
[52:08.840 --> 52:09.840]  This is stupid.
[52:09.840 --> 52:10.840]  You need to be part of the elite.
[52:10.840 --> 52:12.840]  In fact, you even know how this works, means you need to be with us.
[52:12.840 --> 52:14.840]  You need to come to New York.
[52:14.840 --> 52:19.840]  And he just said, you're just a fool, you only can't believe you.
[52:19.840 --> 52:21.840]  This is a foregone conclusion.
[52:21.840 --> 52:22.840]  I said, well, why'd you come on the show?
[52:22.840 --> 52:24.840]  He goes, well, I thought you'd listen to reason.
[52:24.840 --> 52:26.840]  John Harman was in there.
[52:26.840 --> 52:27.840]  John, turn your mic on.
[52:27.840 --> 52:29.840]  We need to use those mics more often than there.
[52:29.840 --> 52:31.840]  I didn't just put them in there to be vestigial.
[52:31.840 --> 52:36.840]  And he's been running the board, answering calls for me for 15 years, 16 years.
[52:36.840 --> 52:42.840]  He heard Rothkopf about 13 years ago in three different breaks have his conversation.
[52:42.840 --> 52:48.840]  He heard that one of the heads of the one of the war colleges.
[52:48.840 --> 52:50.840]  Was it Thomas Barnett?
[52:50.840 --> 52:54.840]  Talk about world government, how I need to accept it and we'll never defeat them.
[52:54.840 --> 52:56.840]  Now the Pentagon supports world government.
[52:56.840 --> 52:57.840]  I'm going to be there.
[52:57.840 --> 52:58.840]  I am.
[52:58.840 --> 53:00.840]  Yeah, tell folks about what you heard Rothkopf say.
[53:00.840 --> 53:04.840]  Yeah, during the break, Rothkopf literally was trying to reason with you and asked you
[53:04.840 --> 53:07.840]  to basically join up with you guys.
[53:07.840 --> 53:10.840]  And it was just kind of surreal.
[53:10.840 --> 53:22.840]  And yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's just when it all sinks in, I mean, you actually go to
[53:22.840 --> 53:24.840]  that.
[53:24.840 --> 53:27.840]  He was asking you straight up, like join up with us.
[53:27.840 --> 53:31.840]  And it was just, I don't know.
[53:31.840 --> 53:32.840]  Not much to say.
[53:32.840 --> 53:36.840]  It's just that it really happened.
[53:36.840 --> 53:44.840]  I wish it was on air, but during the breaks, that's, that's when all the interesting conversations
[53:44.840 --> 53:45.840]  actually took place.
[53:45.840 --> 53:46.840]  Remember Thomas Barnett?
[53:46.840 --> 53:47.840]  Yes, I remember that.
[53:47.840 --> 53:48.840]  Yep, absolutely.
[53:48.840 --> 53:50.840]  From the Pentagon saying you'll never defeat us.
[53:50.840 --> 53:53.840]  The cackling like a witch when I said America would defeat them.
[53:53.840 --> 53:57.840]  Do you remember when we had the head of harp on and then the army of the Air Force Colonel
[53:57.840 --> 54:02.840]  came on and said, no, no, no, this is classified as lawyers were in on the conversation is
[54:02.840 --> 54:03.840]  popped in.
[54:03.840 --> 54:07.840]  And again, this is totally real.
[54:07.840 --> 54:11.840]  They, they pop in and say, hey, go ahead and join up with us.
[54:11.840 --> 54:15.840]  Come up to, I think it was Alaska and have a meeting with us.
[54:15.840 --> 54:20.840]  And it was just like, whoa, I'm just the sound guy.
[54:20.840 --> 54:21.840]  I'm just sitting there running.
[54:21.840 --> 54:24.840]  I'm just going to say that I'm not playing games.
[54:24.840 --> 54:30.840]  I mean, I've been in Hollywood in a 40 story building when the billionaire says, look, Lucifer
[54:30.840 --> 54:31.840]  loves you, Alex.
[54:31.840 --> 54:32.840]  Join with Lucifer.
[54:32.840 --> 54:33.840]  Yeah.
[54:33.840 --> 54:35.840]  I mean, people just don't know how real this is.
[54:35.840 --> 54:39.840]  And until they're there and see it, they don't know.
[54:39.840 --> 54:40.840]  It's, it's absolutely true.
[54:40.840 --> 54:42.840]  These people are into some shady stuff.
[54:42.840 --> 54:45.840]  Well, I want to tell, I want to tell the listeners of you or something.
[54:45.840 --> 54:47.840]  See, most people are looking to sell out.
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.840]  And so they're, that's not, that's not what fulfills folks.
[54:51.840 --> 54:53.840]  And I know our listeners are people that don't want to sell it.
[54:53.840 --> 54:54.840]  They get it.
[54:54.840 --> 54:58.840]  They just need to understand that to everybody else that sold out, it's stupid that to them
[54:58.840 --> 54:59.840]  that we have it sold out.
[54:59.840 --> 55:04.840]  So that's why they persecute us and try to find what it will do to make us just give
[55:04.840 --> 55:05.840]  up.
[55:05.840 --> 55:06.840]  And the answer is nothing.
[55:06.840 --> 55:08.840]  We're not joining with your evil.
[55:08.840 --> 55:13.840]  We're not signing on to hurting innocent men, women and children because my soul is on
[55:13.840 --> 55:14.840]  the line.
[55:14.840 --> 55:16.840]  Don't they get that Harman?
[55:16.840 --> 55:21.840]  I don't, I think they've made the decision to join up with some bad people and they're
[55:21.840 --> 55:25.840]  going to support that because I mean, that's where their paychecks coming from.
[55:25.840 --> 55:31.840]  They get into just some dark stuff and they turned away from the light, essentially.
[55:31.840 --> 55:32.840]  And that's how it works.
[55:32.840 --> 55:36.840]  And you can't get higher in the club unless you do worse and worse stuff.
[55:36.840 --> 55:37.840]  Absolutely.
[55:37.840 --> 55:38.840]  Absolutely.
[55:38.840 --> 55:39.840]  It is a club.
[55:39.840 --> 55:45.840]  You got to get on your knees, ladies and gentlemen, and you got to be dominated.
[55:45.840 --> 55:47.840]  And then it jokes about it.
[55:47.840 --> 55:52.840]  The show's like Team America, but you know, now Gary, get down there and do your job.
[55:52.840 --> 55:54.840]  It's not about sex, Gary.
[55:54.840 --> 55:56.840]  Well, no, it's not.
[55:56.840 --> 55:57.840]  It's about power.
[55:57.840 --> 55:58.840]  It's about control.
[55:58.840 --> 56:03.840]  And if you think getting on your knees in some boardroom and crawling up between the legs
[56:03.840 --> 56:05.840]  of some fat CEO is bad enough.
[56:05.840 --> 56:06.840]  It's not worth it.
[56:06.840 --> 56:08.840]  It's a lot worse than that.
[56:08.840 --> 56:09.840]  Okay.
[56:09.840 --> 56:11.840]  It's a lot worse than just getting on your knees.
[56:11.840 --> 56:12.840]  Yep.
[56:12.840 --> 56:14.840]  So people better decide whether they're going to be with this system or not.
[56:14.840 --> 56:16.840]  As for me, I love the persecution.
[56:16.840 --> 56:18.840]  They can turn the heat up to a thousand.
[56:18.840 --> 56:23.840]  I don't care because the end, they're the ones that got to face God Almighty and God's
[56:23.840 --> 56:25.840]  power and they know it.
[56:25.840 --> 56:26.840]  Amen.
[56:26.840 --> 56:27.840]  Yeah.
[56:27.840 --> 56:29.840]  It's not worth it.
[56:29.840 --> 56:31.840]  You join up with the bad people.
[56:31.840 --> 56:32.840]  It gets worse and worse.
[56:32.840 --> 56:37.840]  It starts off with just small stuff and then the inches up, inches up.
[56:37.840 --> 56:44.840]  Eventually they're offering you sex with a kid or whatever, some just sick stuff.
[56:44.840 --> 56:48.840]  And if you don't do it, well, oh, sorry, now you lose your job.
[56:48.840 --> 56:49.840]  Yep.
[56:49.840 --> 56:51.840]  Or you get off.
[56:51.840 --> 56:52.840]  Absolutely.
[56:52.840 --> 56:55.840]  And that's why they want our guns because they've got stuff playing so horrible for
[56:55.840 --> 56:56.840]  all of us.
[56:56.840 --> 56:58.840]  They know we're going to finally fight back.
[56:58.840 --> 57:02.840]  So I'm just telling everybody they're putting a digital straight jacket and handcuffs on
[57:02.840 --> 57:03.840]  everybody.
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.840]  Just like when they grab a kid, they handcuff them in a basement and it's the same thing.
[57:07.840 --> 57:10.840]  And they literally want to handcuff you and your family.
[57:10.840 --> 57:16.080]  Take away your farms, take away your, your God, take away your guns, take away your mobility,
[57:16.080 --> 57:21.440]  take away your culture so that they get you in that spiritual dungeon so they can literally
[57:21.440 --> 57:24.440]  torture the living hell out of you and we're not going to let them do it.
[57:24.440 --> 57:29.440]  All right, Harman, thanks for coming on the show and relaying that over.
[57:29.440 --> 57:30.440]  He'd like to go on here.
[57:30.440 --> 57:31.440]  A shy guy.
[57:31.440 --> 57:33.440]  But that's, I'm getting guests on my phone for years.
[57:33.440 --> 57:36.440]  Just some of the examples were like, I want to talk to Alex.
[57:36.440 --> 57:37.440]  You're going to lie.
[57:37.440 --> 57:38.440]  Listen, Alex.
[57:38.440 --> 57:39.440]  No, no, no.
[57:39.440 --> 57:41.440]  The DARPA people weren't that bad.
[57:41.440 --> 57:45.440]  I mean, they had a harp, like, meant well, but it is.
[57:45.440 --> 57:52.440]  They're right back if you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[57:52.440 --> 57:59.440]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate and we're not giving up.
[57:59.440 --> 58:06.440]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans to not get down when they attack us
[58:06.440 --> 58:08.440]  and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[58:08.440 --> 58:13.440]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[58:13.440 --> 58:19.440]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[58:19.440 --> 58:24.440]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[58:24.440 --> 58:29.440]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[58:29.440 --> 58:34.440]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[58:34.440 --> 58:37.440]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[58:37.440 --> 58:39.440]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[58:39.440 --> 58:48.440]  They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[58:48.440 --> 58:52.440]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:21.440]  We are back live.
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:26.440]  Mike Adams is coming up to run through the fact that we have the coronavirus in Chicago.
[1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:29.440]  I have a report I haven't gotten to.
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:32.440]  I probably should have given the riders an hour ago.
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:34.440]  Now I can't find it.
[1:00:34.440 --> 1:00:39.440]  You guys print me off the ICE report about the coronavirus on the Texas border.
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:42.440]  That might have been big news we were going to break.
[1:00:42.440 --> 1:00:43.440]  That's the problem.
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:49.440]  I'm just such in the midst of so much incredible stuff that I didn't even get to that.
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:52.440]  Let's air though a few minutes of what just ended.
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:55.440]  Is Trump at the March for Life speech 11 minutes long?
[1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:59.440]  We'll just play part of it now because no other previous president has gone to the marches for life.
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:02.440]  So that's a good thing Trump's doing another promise he's been keeping.
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:03.440]  Here it is.
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:20.440]  We're here for a very simple reason to defend the right of every child born and unborn to fulfill their God given potential.
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:29.440]  For 47 years Americans of all backgrounds have traveled from across the country to stand for life.
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:42.440]  And today as president of the United States I am truly proud to stand with you.
[1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:44.440]  I want to welcome tens of thousands.
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:46.440]  This is a tremendous turnout.
[1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:57.440]  Tens of thousands of high school and college students who took long bus rides to be here in our nation's capital.
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:03.440]  And to make you feel even better there are tens of thousands of people outside that we passed on the way in.
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:08.440]  If anybody would like to give up their spot we could work that out.
[1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:11.440]  You have a tremendous group of people outside.
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:13.440]  Thousands and thousands wanted to get in.
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:20.440]  This is some great success.
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:24.440]  Young people are the heart of the march for life.
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:35.440]  And it's your generation that is making America the pro family pro life nation.
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:45.440]  Our life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us
[1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:52.440]  who fought to raise the conscience of our nation and uphold the rights of our citizens.
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:56.440]  You embrace mothers with care and compassion.
[1:02:56.440 --> 1:03:02.440]  You are powered by prayer and motivated by pure unselfish love.
[1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:05.440]  You are grateful and we are so grateful.
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:12.440]  These are incredible people to be joined by Secretary Alex Azar and Kellyanne Conway.
[1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:19.440]  Thank you.
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:28.440]  And thanks also to Senators Mike Lee and James Langford who are here.
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:30.440]  Thank you, fellas.
[1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:50.440]  Representatives Steve Scalise, Chris Smith, Ralph Abraham, Warren Davidson, Bob Ladder, John Joyce, Lloyd Smucker,
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:55.440]  Brian Fitzpatrick, and Brad Winstrup.
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:58.440]  Thank you all.
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:04.440]  And I have to say, and I look at and I see it exactly, we have many, many more politicians in the audience,
[1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:08.440]  but if you don't mind, I won't introduce them all.
[1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:12.440]  All of us here today understand an eternal truth.
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:20.440]  Every child is a precious and sacred gift from God.
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:29.440]  All right, you know, I should have thought to tell the crew to go past Trump's pleasantries as he always does and then get in the real meat of what he was about to say.
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:34.440]  So we're going to come back from where he just started there about 30 seconds ago for a few minutes on the other side.
[1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:42.440]  And then Mike Adams is going to be here with us to go down the latest developments that are huge like this.
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:49.440]  U.S. still accepting packages from Wuhan, China despite coronavirus quarantine.
[1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:56.440]  I wonder the U.S. is one of the only countries that chat outbreaks as well.
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:23.440]  They experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:34.440]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:49.440]  The pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:51.440]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:06:13.440]  Visit infoworselife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:32.440]  We have to start valuing life again. If we don't value the life of babies and the unborn, we're not going to value the life of our elders or ourselves and other people aren't going to value our life.
[1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:52.440]  Once that safety net of real compassion and real love and understanding that building a more complex civilization where we take care of each other builds economies of scale and that parents having at least 2.2 children is needed to have a pro-human future and not have collapse,
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:07:09.440]  and then you look at the left and the technocrats claiming their virtue and their morality and how much they love humanity and how they're going to create this new golden age, but that everything they do is systematically an anti-human system.
[1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:22.440]  So President Trump in the last three years is the first president in history since Roe v. Wade to actually go to the pro-life march where our reporters are right now.
[1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:32.440]  We have live feeds at Bandai Video and give value to children and say these are humans that are being killed.
[1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:47.440]  If you don't give them value, well then it's babies after they're born. Look at Governor Northam. We're going to break down the big developments with the coronavirus that's gone from being frightening to being clearly a tool of control and of course Bill and Melinda Gates are involved.
[1:07:47.440 --> 1:08:07.440]  Of course the tabletop exercises was 65 million dead and of course it's made its way to the U.S. and of course they're not stopping it even though it's quarantine from packages from Wuhan province. That's all coming up. Here's a few minutes of President Trump's speech that's very important because he's saying 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:16.440]  Together we must protect, cherish and defend the dignity and the sanctity of every human life.
[1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:26.440]  When we see the image of a baby in the womb we glimpse the majesty of God's creation.
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:41.440]  When we hold a newborn in our arms we know the endless love that each child brings to a family. When we watch a child grow we see the splendor that radiates from each human soul.
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:09:04.440]  One life changes the world from my family and I can tell you I send love and I send great, great love and from the first day in office I've taken a historic action to support America's families and to protect the unborn.
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:22.440]  And during my first week in office I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title X taxpayer funding.
[1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:38.440]  I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or that encourages the destruction of human life.
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:10:01.440]  At the United Nations I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life. Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:13.440]  And as the Bible tells us, each person is wonderfully made. We have taken decisive action to protect the religious liberty.
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:36.440]  So important religious liberty has been under attack all over the world and frankly very strongly attacked in our nation. You see it better than anyone but we are stopping it and we're taking care of doctors, nurses, teachers and groups like the little sisters of the poor.
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:11:05.440]  We are preserving faith-based adoption and to uphold our founding documents we have confirmed 187 federal judges who apply the Constitution as written including two phenomenal Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:14.440]  We are protecting pro-life students' right to free speech on college campuses.
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:34.440]  And if universities want federal taxpayer dollars then they must uphold your First Amendment right to speak your mind and if they don't they pay a very big financial penalty which they will not be willing to pay.
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:50.440]  Sadly the far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life.
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:12:03.440]  They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice and we will win because we know how to win.
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:15.440]  Ladies and gentlemen that is why they want President Trump out. That's part of the speech he gave just a little while ago at the giant right to life pro-life rally in March that no other president has ever attended.
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:26.440]  He promised he would. He has attended every of March now, the big ones in D.C. every year and he's done what he said he would do with the executive power to protect life.
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:41.440]  He's going after cities now that are using taxpayer money to pay for abortion as well and winning. So Trump's not perfect but when it comes to pro-life he's really delivered and that's central is valuing human life.
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:13:05.440]  The IMFO Wars, this audience was the critical group that took Trump over the top with the core operating system of what Trump is trying to do and that's why the globalists want to take us out. That's why when you buy the great products that you already need that are excellent at infowarstore.com it is funding the tip of the spear.
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:26.440]  A lot of folks call themselves the tip of the spear and I'm sure they are in their area and we salute them. We are the tip of the tip. We're under the most attack. I'm not a victim. I'm a target like Tommy Robinson says but I can tell you your financial support is needed now more than ever with only 280 days left of the election.
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:40.440]  They are ratcheting up the attacks behind the scenes at incredible levels and it's money that's able to fend that off and build the new infrastructures and ensure that we continue on not just through the election but into the future.
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:59.440]  But the year 2020 is here so I want to just encourage all viewers and all listeners to step up to the plate like President Trump and myself have done and buy the products, spread the word about the shows, share the articles and the videos because that's the only way it's going to happen and we make it so easy.
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:15.440]  We have winter sun that's high quality D3 with vitamin K that are both known to help in the winter not allow viruses to replicate and take you over and allow your body to be healthier against bacteria. That's why it's called winter sun.
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:27.440]  Your body produces vitamin D3 in the skin in a symbiote relationship with the sun just like plants. I have photosynthesis with the sun. You don't produce it naturally unless you have that.
[1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:39.440]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have it and it's massively discounted at 40% off even though we're close to selling out of it. So I'm going to keep it on sale for at least another week, 40% off.
[1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:49.440]  We also have X3 that's back in stock and X2 that just got back in stock. Both are excellent forms of iodine, different formulas for different people.
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:15:00.440]  Read about it for yourself, but this is the good halogen that counters the bad halogen, the fluoride, the bromine, the chlorine and that entire family. So these are 40% off with free shipping.
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:09.440]  When you get them together, they're 50% off and that's as low as I can ever go with these combo deals because we don't put a bunch of markup in here.
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:24.440]  But don't think about supporting M4s. If you don't know what good, clean iodine is going to do for you and your body, especially if you've been deficient and even the U.N. admits over 2 billion people have mental disabilities because of iodine deficiency.
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:33.440]  It's incredible. And if you'll just get the products at m4store.com, it funds the M4 war, it funds freedom, it keeps us here in the face of the globalists and you get products you need.
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:41.440]  So those are all at m4store.com. Please take advantage of these sales today and boost your immune system during this critical time.
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:50.440]  Now more than ever, ladies and gentlemen, fortify your immune system with clean water, good green vegetables, vitamin C, vitamin D3 and iodine.
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:16:05.440]  You can get the vitamin D3 and iodine at m4store.com right now at 40% off.
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:25.440]  Trust your family survival to survivalistgamps.com.
[1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:55.440]  United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:17:04.440]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clawed arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:12.440]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:18.440]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:22.440]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:29.440]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:37.440]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:48.440]  Order your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com.
[1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:56.440]  Heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:03.440]  m4store.com. We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days.
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:09.440]  At the rate we're selling them, I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste.
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:17.440]  And it doesn't compete with super blue that's 4-5 of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free, the adult or the children's.
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:22.440]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it.
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:31.440]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[1:18:31.440 --> 1:18:37.440]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis. This is all proven.
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:50.440]  You can make claims with this. But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:56.440]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation m4store.com. And that's why we're still on air thanks to you.
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:01.440]  The InfoWars store is the only place to shop to guarantee your support for the InfoWars crew.
[1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:07.440]  While we're in Washington fighting for our rights, it's more important than ever that you're able to support our team in the fight for liberty.
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:11.440]  So we've discounted some of our returning fan favorite products that you can stock up now.
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:17.440]  Survival Shield X2, our incredible nascent iodine formula, is finally back in stock and 40% off.
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:21.440]  After being sold out for weeks, the fan favorite supplement has finally returned.
[1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:27.440]  Or you can get the nascent iodine pack with Survival Shield X2 and X3 for 50% off each bottle.
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:32.440]  Ultimate fish oil and prostagard are both back after months of waiting as well for 35% off.
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:38.440]  These products are hard to source at the quality we demand, so we don't know how long they'll last. Make sure you get yours today.
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:45.440]  If supplements aren't your thing, we have storeable food supplies for up to 50% off, as well as water and air filter units for 30% off.
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:52.440]  There's never going to be a better time to support the InfoWars team. Show Owen, David, Alex, Savannah, and everyone else behind the scenes.
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:20:19.440]  You stand with them in the fight against journey today.
[1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:22.440]  We knew that 2020 was going to be eventful.
[1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:28.440]  We're only 24 days in and it's bad.
[1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:35.440]  Now, studying the globalist and even making a film about it, in-game blueprint for global enslavement,
[1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:56.440]  we show the White Papers in quotes where the United Nations Billa Melinda Gates Foundation, IBM, the Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics Research Institute in New York, as well as the Jeffrey Epstein Globalist Combine that we name 13 years ago,
[1:20:56.440 --> 1:21:03.440]  have set up a secret world government. That's their words, not mine.
[1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:16.440]  A secret world government, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:18.440]  Think about that.
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:24.440]  And then I've got somewhere here, the Wall Street Journal. Here it is. That's what I was looking for. Here it is.
[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:30.440]  Amazon Prime Video gives amateur how-to conspiracy theories a stage.
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:40.440]  It goes on to say, Jones claims there's a world government.
[1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:49.440]  Well, that's out in the open now and how Amazon took the film down. But the reason I mentioned that is,
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:22:02.440]  we talk about how they plan to have smaller bio-weapon releases that aren't as deadly to get the global control system in place and then have bigger releases than tightening the grip of global control
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:11.440]  during the larger depopulation events that happen and then the deep state globally pretending it's the savior while it's actually organizing operation.
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:17.440]  Just like they're overriding the environment, poisoning it, genetic engineering, biosludge, putting poison in the water.
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:26.440]  They're trying to be the guardians saying, those of you that don't let us control you, you're the bad guys for carbon dioxide because they're building a world that's uninhabitable for humans.
[1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:32.440]  They're terraforming it for whatever reason, where the atmosphere doesn't even match up to what we need.
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:36.440]  And you can speculate all day about the final two plus two equals of what's running this.
[1:22:36.440 --> 1:22:41.440]  The Bible says it's a fallen entity here that wants to kill us so it has the planet for itself.
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:47.440]  Whether you believe that or not, that's what the globalists say. They're ascending, but they have to see us die first.
[1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:50.440]  They have to depopulate the earth first before they reward it.
[1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:55.440]  So joining us for the rest of the hour is Mike Adams to get into the coronavirus, to get into the poison in the water.
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:23:04.440]  They're now admitting in Fox News the biosludge, how it's part of the master plan and the incredible persecution that he and others are under with these secret courts taking websites down right now.
[1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:11.440]  So this is an incredible atmosphere we're in, Mike, and we'll walk through it all, but now they admit what you were saying a week ago,
[1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:18.440]  what I was saying a week ago after I followed your lead, because I respect you and your researchers, that they're already covering up how big this is.
[1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:24.440]  The hospitals are already collapsing over there. They're letting it spread. They're letting packages still be shipped to the U.S.
[1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:34.440]  That's at TheNationalFall.com and at FullWars.com, and this is out of control. And, oh, even The New York Times is a little billable in the gates.
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:36.440]  Three months ago, thank God they wore game this exact scenario. They've got an answer for us, Mike, world government.
[1:23:36.440 --> 1:23:42.440]  So when we report this a week ago, we're bad and evil. But when they report it, it's a good thing, Mike Adams.
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:52.440]  Right. It's insane. And I've got bombshell after bombshell to lay out for you here, even though my own network has been severely compromised the last few days and we're way behind.
[1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:57.440]  Me personally, I've been studying the situation. So I've got a lot for you here. Let me just get right into it.
[1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:08.440]  Number one, realize that the globalists, they know that the most likely fatalities in their simulations of 65 million people dead will be liberals in cities.
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:20.440]  So the globalists are willing to massacre their own leftists, which, by the way, is consistent with that Project Veritas video documenting that Bernie Sanders supporters who said they want to mass execute liberals.
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:28.440]  So understand that any time you release a bio weapon, an engineered virus like this, it's going to impact the cities.
[1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:35.440]  The second bombshell here, I should be writing stories on this, but again, I'm trying to recover from all the attacks.
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:43.440]  But the second bombshell is that the conditions in liberal cities such as San Francisco, where citizens are allowed to defecate on the streets,
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:51.440]  and that feces is swept into the sewer system, swept directly out into the oceans where it's swept back up onto the beaches.
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:56.440]  Those conditions are ideal for spreading coronavirus.
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:00.440]  Now you might think, well, this coronavirus is a respiratory virus, but guess what?
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:11.440]  Doctors in the hospitals in the Wuhan province are now reporting that there are infected patients who are showing symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting and have no fever.
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.440]  No fever. That's another bombshell story, Alex.
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:18.440]  There are asymptomatic, in other words, no respiratory symptoms.
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:29.440]  Carriers of coronavirus now confirmed in China, which means they will not be detected by the current symptom lists and by the information that hospitals and doctors in the CDC has.
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:34.440]  It also means there are infected patients who are slipping through the net right now.
[1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:45.440]  Even though we have three confirmed in the United States now, three patient zeros, you might call them, there are likely hundreds of people who are infected in the United States and have not yet been exposed.
[1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:47.440]  I've got more bombshells for you, Alex.
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:49.440]  You want to jump in?
[1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:51.440]  You want me to keep going?
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:53.440]  I want you to keep going, Mike.
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:54.440]  Okay. All right.
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:26:04.440]  So we know that it can be spread by feces, most likely. So if it's spread by feces, then we've got another major problem because of the biosludge issue.
[1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:07.440]  You know, you and I have talked about this. We've sounded the alarm on this.
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:14.440]  Human sewage is collected into, in every city in America, and then it's spread on farms as fertilizer.
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:20.440]  And guess what? They do not destroy the viruses in that so-called fertilizer.
[1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:25.440]  In fact, that's where most of these viruses we know breed is in feces, flurries.
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:34.440]  Exactly. I don't know if you recall, but in my biosludge film I released a couple years ago, I interviewed a top EPA virologist who was fired from the EPA.
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:37.440]  His career was destroyed. His lab was shut down.
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:40.440]  And he warned about this exact scenario.
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:49.440]  He said that the biosludge vectors could be used to spread biological weapons very easily because anything that you dump into the sewage system, anything you dump into a storm drain,
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:58.440]  will be distributed by the city to farms and school playgrounds and fields all around the city, and that is happening right now.
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:04.440]  By the way, Mike, I don't want to interrupt you because I know you've got hours of incredible intel, but let me just back up here.
[1:27:04.440 --> 1:27:12.440]  Let's go through this slowly. We have to go in the next hour. If you can, we'll do it, but let's walk through this.
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:20.440]  In China, they've got giant chemical fumigators. You can roll some footage of that, driving around in Hunan and other areas,
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:31.440]  pumping massive amounts of chemicals, but really antiviral pesticides, what they are, into the air to try to kill the virus they believe is airborne.
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:41.440]  Okay. Now, meanwhile, we have what the left celebrates, just like city council members in Portland, Oregon, say, pooping is freedom.
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:46.440]  Pooping everywhere is a fun thing they do, and I'm not joking, folks. It's serious. And the needle's everywhere.
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:52.440]  So every leftist city is an open sewer. So is Austin now. Everyone's moving out of the downtown. It's collapsing.
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:28:02.440]  The city's everywhere. Needle's everywhere. It's a joke. They call it, you know, downtown buildings, the stink and one particular building, because these places stink so bad.
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:10.440]  So you're not just saying this. The left opens our borders, lets everybody comes in, gets rid of all health screening, and then just lets everyone open their crap everywhere.
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:14.440]  So we're just a prime place for this to hit. That's what you're saying.
[1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:25.440]  Right. And you're arrested in San Francisco if you serve plastic straws, but not if you defecate on the street. So think about the priorities of liberals and also the open borders policies, as you just mentioned.
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:39.440]  This is the ideal situation for the spread of infectious disease in America. And I believe that that software model that predicted 65 million deaths globally probably did not account for these conditions of filthy liberal cities that are already collapsing.
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:48.440]  Let's talk about the Billow-Millenegades Foundation wargaming this three months ago and patenting the virus and everything else on the other side with Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[1:28:48.440 --> 1:29:13.440]  I haven't gotten to this yet. We're under the greatest attack ever as well, just like Mike. I have a big announcement on that when we come back.
[1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:35.440]  We have online activity from hackers, trackers and large corporations and not just one, but all your devices with one out of the box setup.

[1:29:35.440 --> 1:30:03.440]  I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer. I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:13.440]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line.
[1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:21.440]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract. I don't want them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.

[1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:47.440]  I know you this evening out here's a surprise. I know that you have cause there's magic in my eyes. I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles.
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:52.440]  Oh yeah.
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:59.440]  The Eiffel Tower and the Tardemont, let's get on a clear day.
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:05.440]  You thought that I would need it just to want to see you right through the day.
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:17.440]  Go back live. I'm going to have Mike Adams host this segment and probably most of the next just because I'm going to jump in and erupt if I get the microphone on. So I'm going to turn the microphone off and just let him take over.
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:46.440]  But at the start of the next hour ahead of investigative journalist John Rubberport joining us, I have been the subject of deep state attacks that are next level and I was asked by the FBI and folks with the Central Intelligence Agency at this point to not get into this on air.
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:50.440]  There's different factions in both groups, obviously.
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:59.440]  You heard John Harmon earlier talk about years ago, the head of the Kissinger Group on the phone with me during breaks and join us. World government's good. You're going to be part of the elite. You're already the elite of this.
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:08.440]  And then, you know, the Pentagon people doing it over the phone. I mean, that's just what he's heard on the phone. Okay. When I'm talking to guests, you ought to see it behind the scenes.
[1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:18.440]  But they basically told me you stop now or you're dead. And this isn't just like a death threat over the telephone. It's like, listen, you need to do this.
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:28.440]  The best thing for your family, this is the way it is. Now, only reason I bring that up is you're going to see incredible lies in the media about me in the next few days.
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:38.440]  You're going to see and it's going to be horrible. But the good news is nobody buys it like when they planted the child porn on us. Folks, I'm not sending child porn to Sandy Hook families. Give me a break.
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:46.440]  Okay. Everybody knows that's crap. But it isn't about Alex Jones. I'm just a canary down in this coal mine, but they have canaries.
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:53.440]  So when the methane goes up certain high canaries die before humans do canaries can't handle any any any gas.
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:36:04.440]  So when a canary falls over, miners get out. Okay. Well, the canaries are dead right now. I mean, the equivalent we've gone through most people.
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:11.440]  It's like a Star Trek analogy. Spock stronger than humans. We can handle radiation longer, but he's dead already. And kind of encouraged trying to go on. They go, you're not saving him. He's dead already.
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:19.440]  And I don't say this in a victimology. I'm proud of what we've done. But most nobody else can handle this. We knew this was coming. We built for it. We've handled a bunch.
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:28.440]  We're dead already. Okay. You just need to understand something that the fact that they're doing all of this right now means they're going for broken. It's the president and everything else.
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:38.440]  And this is for real. So and the coronavirus obviously is a prepared simulant for cover for other stuff because they always have something else that's really doing and they got the virus.
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:45.440]  I mean, you can see all the stuff going on. But I mean, it means we're now game time. The ball has been kicked off. This is it.
[1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:56.440]  2020 new world order toe-to-toe with humanity. Mike Adams, you take over this segment next and I'll be here watching. But you'll bring us out of break. You'll bring us back to the next segment. You've got the floor. Break it down.
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:10.440]  All right, I'm going to start with the context of just a little segue from what Alex just said. When I first became aware of Alex Jones and Info Wars maybe 15 years ago, I remember my first thought, which might be the first thought of many people, was that
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:18.440]  things couldn't possibly be as bad as what Alex is saying. It was my first thought. Couldn't possibly be that bad. What's he talking about?
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:30.440]  Now, 15 years later, whatever it is, after having lived through this myself and been the subject of these vicious attacks and been an investigative journalist and running an infrastructure,
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:41.440]  running a team of editors and writers and covering these things, I'm here to tell you something today that maybe even Info Wars listeners might find shocking.
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:53.440]  Excuse me. The truth is, it's way worse than what Alex has ever been able to articulate. And he's done an incredible job and he's trying to sound the alarm.
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:38:10.440]  And the things that are happening in our world today, the corruption, the fraud, the maliciousness, not just the lies, but the demonic force of total destruction, destruction of logic and reason and life and humanity.
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:26.440]  These forces are so evil and so, they've so successfully invaded and taken over every institution from the media to government, to education and Hollywood and so on, that I'm here to tell you, it is way worse than what Alex has ever said.
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:40.440]  In fact, it's way worse than anything I could have ever communicated. And I just have to apologize right here live on air. I've failed to accurately sound the alarm.
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:55.440]  I've been too reserved. I've been too intellectual. I have not been able to communicate to you the degree of trouble that we are in as a human species.
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:39:11.440]  To say we are so screwed doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. We are targeted for extermination. There is a total wipeout of humanity that's being planned, that's being engineered, it's being rolled out before your very eyes.
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:22.440]  The censorship aspects of this are just the surface layer. That's just to stop people from talking about it so that the attacks can succeed more rapidly and more completely.
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:29.440]  The attacks on Alex Jones and the attacks on myself and others are just a small part of the overall plan.
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:38.440]  And the viciousness of those attacks tells you the desperation of those who are behind this, that they pulled out all the stops.
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:52.440]  There's nothing they won't do from the impeachment of Trump in the Senate, the lies of Adam Schiff to the CDC being taken over by the vaccine industry and the vaccine industry deliberately lacing their vaccines with infectious diseases.
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:56.440]  I mean, I'm here to tell you one of the bombshells I need to cover today.
[1:39:56.440 --> 1:40:09.440]  Then I'll describe it in more detail is that all of this coronavirus situation, this is just the first wave, folks. The second wave of the pandemic begins when the coronavirus vaccine begins being administered.
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:15.440]  And we will come to learn that that vaccine contains, excuse me, live virus.
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:22.440]  There will be live virus in the coronavirus vaccine and it will set off a firestorm of the second wave.
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:26.440]  This has already been planned, already engineered. We know the playbook.
[1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:31.440]  And like I said, it's way worse than anything that Alex could have explained or that I could have explained.
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:34.440]  I've failed to explain all this. I've failed to sound the alarm.
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:45.440]  If we had succeeded, there would be millions of people marching in the streets today against the criminal CDC, against maybe Congress or at least the corrupt Democrat House.
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:54.440]  There would be millions of people marching to demand control of our borders so that we don't have infectious diseases just running across the borders and infecting Americans.
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:41:05.440]  There would be people marching in front of the Fed to demand honest money and an end to the fake fiat currency system that's silently stealing all your wealth and all your productivity every night as you sleep.
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:10.440]  Your money is being stolen through debasement of the money supply.
[1:41:10.440 --> 1:41:16.440]  I can't sound the alarm enough and in a sense, I almost feel, I feel numb to it.
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:26.440]  It's so insane every day, day after day that in order to even function in this environment, I have to turn it off.
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:36.440]  I have to turn off these elements that should have us screaming, screaming, begging for God to intervene, begging for humanity to wake up.
[1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:49.440]  And yet, we can't because just to deal with this, we have to alter our own circuitry, so to speak, just to be able to talk and function because the truth is so nightmarish.
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:58.440]  It's so horrific. It's such a nightmare. What can we do as a human race?
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:07.440]  I'm here to tell you, it's over for humanity. There will only be lone survivors. The strategy must now shift.
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:14.440]  You can be a survivor. We can help you survive. The information here at InfoWars and what I do can help you survive.
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:24.440]  I'll give you some practical things in the next segment, but maybe it's an astonishing statement to hear from me, the health ranger, but it's over for humanity as a whole.
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:37.440]  The masses will be slaughtered. The depopulation agenda cannot be stopped. Do you understand? Do you effing understand? I'm not going to use profanity, but you need to be thinking in those terms.
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:46.440]  Do you understand? You are targeted for termination. All of humanity is targeted. There may be lone survivors. Now our job is to help you be one of those people.
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:55.440]  I'll have more on the other side. This is Mike Adams with InfoWars.com. Stay with us.
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:01.440]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:07.440]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:16.440]  You got to get up there and tell people. So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:33.440]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:47.440]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:16.440]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese have bought control of your media, but it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:28.440]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:38.440]  Anyone once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump, will also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:53.440]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:56.440]  Hail Cobra!
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:00.440]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:05.440]  Now we're bringing you an all-new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:14.440]  Altra 12 from Infowars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:21.440]  Altra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:26.440]  Help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Altra 12.

[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:30.440]  This is Mike Adams continuing with our emergency broadcast today. Thank you for joining us.
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:33.440]  I'll be with you during this segment and the next segment.
[1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:41.440]  I believe we have, if I understand correctly, rapid report coming on in the next hour to talk to us about this accelerating infectious disease pandemic.
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:47.440]  Now, in the last segment, I mentioned that I believe it's over for humanity.
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:57.440]  I think that humanity is being targeted with so many vectors of destruction that, in my assessment, the bulk of the human race will not survive this.
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:04.440]  Now, there can be lone survivors or small groups of survivors, and I think that that's the strategy we have to get to now.
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:09.440]  And just the fact that you are tuning into this broadcast means that you are a survivor. You have a survivor mindset.
[1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:14.440]  You're not part of the sheeple class that just walks off a cliff because everybody else is doing it in front of you.
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:19.440]  You question, hey, wait a minute, isn't that a cliff? Maybe we shouldn't jump off that cliff.
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:22.440]  You're different from the masses, thank God.
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:38.440]  And because the masses are committing suicide and they're going to go along with this global suicide, this coronavirus bioengineered weapon system that is being deliberately released after having been developed as a weapon against humanity.
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:41.440]  Now, where to even begin?
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:54.440]  Let me cover some basics about this outbreak. Number one, a doctor from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is now saying that carriers of this disease may have no fever whatsoever.
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:49:02.440]  So that means that people can carry this and spread this disease without being identified as having coronavirus.
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:13.440]  So that means that the doctors at hospitals and the CDC officials are wrong or, let's say, at least not fully informed in their assessment of who might be infected.
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:16.440]  That means infections are going to slip through the cracks.
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:24.440]  We're already reading stories of multiple patients being scanned in California for whether or not they carry this virus.
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:30.440]  And it's said that they don't have it according to the officials.
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:33.440]  But what if they're not looking for the right symptoms?
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:43.440]  So a second point here is that one way that I believe that you know that this is a real pandemic is because the WHO is trying to downplay it.
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:48.440]  So whatever the WHO does, the World Health Organization, it's the opposite of reality.
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:55.440]  When the bird flu virus was a non-pandemic, they declared it a stage six pandemic.
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:06.440]  Understand, carefully, when the Zika virus was a made-up virus, I mean, it was a made-up pandemic, just to funnel billions of dollars to vaccine companies.
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:08.440]  We were told that that was huge.
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:10.440]  We were told, I mean, do you remember a couple of years ago?
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:22.440]  We were told that babies were going to be born with shrunken heads all across Florida and Louisiana and Mississippi, the hot, humid regions of the Southeast United States.
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:24.440]  Babies were going to be born with shrunken heads.
[1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:26.440]  You remember those news stories?
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:29.440]  That was all over the media because of the Zika virus.
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:34.440]  And we all better run out and get Zika vaccines and we better have emergency Zika vaccine research.
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:44.440]  And sure enough, Congress, if I remember correctly, they approved, I think it was $2 billion for Zika virus vaccine research.
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:48.440]  Turns out there were no babies born with shrunken heads in Florida.
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:52.440]  There's not an epidemic of shrunken headed babies in Florida.
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:54.440]  Never happened. It was all made up.
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:51:05.440]  But today, they're saying, oh, the WHO says, quote, it's not the time to declare an emergency, even as a real emergency is happening, in my opinion.
[1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:14.440]  The number of people infected in China, according to estimates, could be upwards of 100,000, maybe 200,000 people.
[1:51:14.440 --> 1:51:27.440]  It's hard to know at this point because it's so difficult to diagnose the symptoms. The symptoms are very diverse, sometimes vomiting, sometimes headaches, sometimes conjunctivitis, sometimes diarrhea, sometimes fever and coughing, but it varies.
[1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:29.440]  So we don't even know how many people have it.
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:34.440]  We do know that 23 million people are quarantined in China.
[1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:38.440]  23 million people are quarantined because of the multiple cities that are now under quarantine.
[1:51:38.440 --> 1:51:43.440]  And as the video is showing you on your screen, if you're watching, the hospitals are being overrun.
[1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:47.440]  People are dropping dead in the streets of China, especially in Wuhan province.
[1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:55.440]  The hospitals are overrun. The supplies have run out almost everywhere in China.
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:52:05.440]  The food supplies, and this is a critical issue for all of us to get, the food supplies are wiped out in those cities because of the quarantine.
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:15.440]  And if you are not yet prepared with a backup food supply in the United States, and you live in any major city or near a major city, then you're crazy.
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:24.440]  Because the quarantine, when it happens, what immediately follows are incredible shortages of food supplies and medical supplies.
[1:52:24.440 --> 1:52:35.440]  And anti-retroviral medicines and, you know, just masks, just masks and biohazard suits all wiped out, gloves, you know, the latex gloves.
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:42.440]  We use them in our laboratory every day when we're prepping samples for analytical runs for glyphosate and heavy metals and so on.
[1:52:42.440 --> 1:52:48.440]  We buy gloves. We may not be able to get them if this continues to expand and explode all across the world.
[1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:55.440]  So thinking about supplies is one of the key things for survival as this spreads.
[1:52:55.440 --> 1:53:07.440]  If you don't have supplies, which may include plastic sheeting or just sanitizing chemicals like bleach, we knew, by the way, years ago, that bleach killed Ebola virus.
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:16.440]  If you sprayed surfaces with bleach, like a bleach-water mixture, and put it in a spray bottle, you could spray down the surfaces and it killed Ebola virus.
[1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:25.440]  And then what happened back then? Well, the media and the government, they said that, oh, don't talk about natural cures for Ebola.
[1:53:25.440 --> 1:53:31.440]  Don't talk about colloidal silver. Don't talk about these essential oils. Don't talk about Chinese medicine.
[1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:40.440]  I think one formula is called the minor blue-green dragon formula. It's a Chinese medicine formula that turns out it's full of all these antiviral molecules that have now been proven by science.
[1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:45.440]  But that was from, I think, 2,500 years ago in Chinese medicine. They knew how to deal with that.
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:50.440]  But today, pharma has taken over China. And so these outbreaks are occurring.
[1:53:50.440 --> 1:53:55.440]  And even in China, almost no one is allowed to practice Chinese medicine anymore.
[1:53:55.440 --> 1:53:58.440]  Same thing's true in Taiwan. Same thing's true in Hong Kong.
[1:53:58.440 --> 1:54:03.440]  Western medicine has taken over so the natural cures are being wiped out.
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:11.440]  Or even criminalized, there will be takedown orders. You know the censorship takedown order that I've been talking about the last couple of days that hit natural news.
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:25.440]  Make no mistake, when this pandemic gets large in the United States, there will be takedown orders and censorship orders to take offline and ban any account of anybody who talks about a natural cure for coronavirus.
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:30.440]  Why is that? Why will that be happening? Because they can't have people curing themselves.
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:34.440]  They can't allow people to survive the onslaught.
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:42.440]  They, the globalists who engineered this, who funded it, who ran the laboratories, they want to kill as many people as possible.
[1:54:42.440 --> 1:54:54.440]  Their own software simulations run by organizations funded by Bill and Melinda Gates show 65 million deaths will occur globally from a very similar strain of coronavirus.
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:55:05.440]  And I think that their software models vastly underestimate the conditions of filth in our cities. And as we talked about before, the biosludge, the recycling of human feces and putting it on farms.
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:17.440]  I mean, just on that point alone, we could do an entire show. I mean, imagine the food shortages that will occur in America if the food supply is found to be contaminated with coronavirus.
[1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:28.440]  And it will be because this virus is going to be spread through feces. It's going to end up in biosludge. It's going to be distributed by the cities on two farms, on two food crops.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:39.440]  In Washington state, they just legalized dumping dissolved humans down the drain. I'm not even making this up.
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:50.440]  It's recycling. Instead of cremating a dead person or burying them, they can now dissolve them with chemicals and literally flush them down the municipal sewage system.
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:55:58.440]  Dead people will be in the biosludge. Dead people who may have died from coronavirus. Do you understand?
[1:55:58.440 --> 1:56:01.440]  I'm trying to get you to connect the dots here. Put the pieces of this puzzle together.
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:10.440]  Dead people who may have been killed by coronavirus will be in the biosludge. The biosludge will be spread on the food crops, the orchards in Washington state.
[1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:19.440]  And then what happens? Boom! Massive new wave of outbreaks from people eating the food that's infected with the virus.
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:23.440]  Or it's just contaminated with. It's just covered with filth and viruses.
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:33.440]  And then what will that cause the media? We'll say, well, you've got to go get vaccinated. They'll pass mandatory emergency vaccine orders in Washington, in Oregon, in California.
[1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:43.440]  Emergency vaccine orders. Everyone will be required to get vaccinated, essentially at gunpoint. This is just what Governor Northam did in Virginia with the emergency vaccine order.
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:44.440]  Oh, you can't carry a gun.
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:54.440]  I got him. Stay there. Stay there, because that's exactly where I was going next. All of this is pre-programmed by Billa Melinda Gates, who are the science officers for the eugenics operation that's on record.
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:57:02.440]  And this is the huge planetary plan. But the good news is, even the head U.N. scientists admit, there's a cover-up vaccines are killing people.
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:10.440]  So there's a rebellion within. They admit the majority of doctors are, quote, becoming wobbly and don't believe the vaccines are good.
[1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:19.440]  So as you said, as blatant as all this is, as open and naked as it all is, is an attempt to normalize it and break our will.
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:29.440]  So we can't give up faith and hope. But I agree with you. I almost started the show saying, at a gut level, I just want to run off the country with my family and build a redoubt and find like-minded people.
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:35.440]  It's not going to work like that, though. But at a primitive level, we would try to pull back away from this to a safe zone.
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:43.440]  There's nowhere to run until we're a Type 1 civilization. We must stand here. We must fight. There is no surrender.
[1:57:46.440 --> 1:57:52.440]  Twenty-five years ago when I first began broadcasting, I was a realist and I was honest with the listeners.
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:58.440]  America was in a coma. We were being absolutely poisoned physically, culturally, and spiritually.
[1:57:58.440 --> 1:58:03.440]  The New World Order was running rampant because the public was asleep.
[1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:13.440]  Fast forward to this year in 2020 and to see the Soros spend over $100 million on the women's march here in D.C. at Los Angeles.
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:19.440]  And they might have had 30,000 people. Maybe. They had 5 million three years ago.
[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:29.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was here. That is emblematic of how his money and Chico money cannot buy them the AstroTurf anymore.
[1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:37.440]  So yes, the awakenings happened, but we're not out of the woods. The globalists are going to throw a bunch of Hail Marys during this Trump Senate trial.
[1:58:37.440 --> 1:59:03.440]  And we're going to be covering it live from D.C. at ban.video. Please be Paul Revere and share this link.
[1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:16.440]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus. I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[1:59:16.440 --> 1:59:24.440]  It's incredible. So do yourself a favor. Try out the products if you've been on the fence. You can't lose except if you don't take action.
[1:59:24.440 --> 1:59:31.440]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace in our action.
[1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:39.440]  But you need these products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing. And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[1:59:39.440 --> 2:00:06.440]  That's how we span in the face of the NWO instead of imploding. We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:29.440]  I really want to take calls today. But because of the breaking news, the guests we have were not, but I am coming in tomorrow, 100%.
[2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:40.440]  And I'm going to host a live call in show. It'll be on the radio, TV, satellites. When I say commercial free, you got to have breaks at the first, the hour, the middle, the hour for some stations.
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:47.440]  But we're going to have like six minutes of breaks an hour, three minutes at the bottom of the hour, three minutes at the end of the hour.
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:59.440]  And stations are really welcome to cover that. But I'm going to take two hours of calls at least tomorrow, two to four p.m. central on the Saturday show that we're launching right now.
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:09.440]  And of course, there's a well established now for over a decade Sunday show four to six p.m. This broadcast has been here from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:25.440]  for over 22 years, 25 years total on 26 years almost on air. I was saying, you know, they've had patented cancer viruses since the 1920s, 80 years ago, and I'm like, that's 100 years ago.
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:37.440]  I mean, time is just flying. We're in 2020 here. And Mike Adams, I want to get into the attacks, because you understand. It's not like you're going, oh, I'm under attack.
[2:01:37.440 --> 2:01:41.440]  This is terrible. You know, you you see the scale of the attack.
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:49.440]  That's what empathy is. Empathy is not some goody to chew thing that biology built in that where these weird leftists, they want us to have false empathy to what they say.
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:56.440]  The real empathy is a nerve ending that, OK, Alex is under attack. Mike Adams is under attack.
[2:01:56.440 --> 2:02:02.440]  Another sites under attack that they're those are good people doing good work. I'm under attack. That's a nerve.
[2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:10.440]  And so it's not some goody to shoe empathy thing. This is real. And people need to understand that.
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:22.440]  It's very difficult for anyone to truly comprehend the scale of what's happening to you and to myself. And it's it's the attacks on you, of course, are on an epic historic scale.
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:28.440]  Only the attacks on President Trump could be compared to the attacks on you. And in fact, they may be even worse on you than on him.
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:35.440]  And I know that you can't even talk publicly about some of the details that would be the most shocking because of the legal action that you're involved with and so on.
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:43.440]  Well, it's setups. Exactly. They've got a fourth dimensional warfare, fifth dimensional, sixth dimensional where they know they do this, I do this, they do this.
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:49.440]  And then I can't do it because people always have like maybe Trump. Why can't Trump do a lot of stuff?
[2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:55.440]  I think he's looking out on responses. I can't calculate out like that. Maybe he's smarter than we are.
[2:02:55.440 --> 2:03:03.440]  Well, I can't know the state of mind of the president, except I know he loves America. I know he hates the deep state. I know he's.
[2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:11.440]  Oh, yeah, their hate, the Satanist hate of Trump is real. So let's talk about it. Why do they hate Trump? Because that's the answer to the riddle.
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:19.440]  Trump is defending humanity. You know, a lot of us breaks down to whether you're on team humanity or or anti human.
[2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:29.440]  So let's talk about that. We come back in the unprecedented, not censorship, but industrial governmental criminal fraud, the model of tyranny.
[2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:36.440]  We come back, but it's first, once you have the floor here, Mike, because it really is. Are you on team humanity? Are you on team depopulation?
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:44.440]  And why are they on team depopulation? And they tell us why it's really macabre. Mike Adams, naturalnews.com. Please don't forget, folks.
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:51.440]  I want to stay in the game here. And of all the things you can do, I'm not being patronizing to Christians. I'm a Christian. I love God.
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:58.440]  The prayer is number one. It's paramount. It's the, it's the coin of the realm. It's, it's everything you're saying to God, I want this.
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:04:03.440]  And if God agrees with what you're doing, then God makes the connection. That's, that's, that's what that is.
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:11.440]  That's why only the prayers God wants to answer answered. But you have free will. You got to ask. And if God's already wanting to give it to you and you got to say, I want it, then you get it.
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:20.440]  You see what I mean? I don't want to Christ uses example of the bridegroom and, and you know, the, the, the bride, you've got to want it.
[2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:33.440]  God's ready to give it to you. You've got to open up that channel. But I'm just telling you right now here, ladies and gentlemen, that your prayers, your word of mouth are not key.
[2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:46.440]  It's the key. It's the lock. It's the doorknob. It's the door. It's the house. It's the hill. It's the realm. It's the planet. It's the solar system. It's the galaxy. It's the universe. It's the multiverse.
[2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:54.440]  It's the mind of God. It's everything. Your will, your action is key.
[2:04:54.440 --> 2:05:04.440]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people and Alex Jones of InfoWords.
[2:05:04.440 --> 2:05:15.440]  Our operation to our partners, the Communist Chinese have bought control of your media. But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:26.440]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[2:05:26.440 --> 2:05:36.440]  Anyone wants to be stave these attacks that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[2:05:36.440 --> 2:05:51.440]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[2:05:51.440 --> 2:06:10.440]  Ha ha! Hey, little cowboyyyyyy.
[2:06:10.440 --> 2:06:20.440]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace. In order to fuel hospitals in the U.K., they're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency.
[2:06:20.440 --> 2:06:22.840]  of efficiency and prosperity.
[2:06:22.840 --> 2:06:27.840]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:30.280]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:32.960]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:35.240]  Because of its enormous popularity,
[2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:37.760]  Soylent Green is in short supply.
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:40.800]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:44.400]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:46.680]  You must evacuate the area.
[2:06:46.680 --> 2:06:48.680]  Okay, Tuesday!
[2:06:48.680 --> 2:06:52.320]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo,
[2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:54.400]  Big Builder Bird Group Company,
[2:06:54.400 --> 2:06:59.080]  are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for
[2:06:59.080 --> 2:07:01.080]  and the flavoring, but we already know.
[2:07:01.080 --> 2:07:03.120]  So enjoy the flavor.
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:04.480]  We're going to get the real solution,
[2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:06.480]  which is going to be a combination of death panels
[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:07.680]  and sales taxes.
[2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:09.680]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[2:07:09.680 --> 2:07:11.560]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:12.880]  I'm for regular suicide.
[2:07:12.880 --> 2:07:14.680]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[2:07:14.680 --> 2:07:17.640]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life
[2:07:17.640 --> 2:07:19.080]  for that patient?
[2:07:19.080 --> 2:07:23.240]  Would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers
[2:07:23.240 --> 2:07:26.160]  and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:28.680]  But that's called the death panel.
[2:07:28.680 --> 2:07:30.480]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[2:07:30.480 --> 2:07:34.560]  They told me to say that they were sorry,
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:37.920]  but that you had become unreliable.
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:39.920]  Ha ha ha!
[2:07:39.920 --> 2:07:43.920]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[2:07:43.920 --> 2:07:46.920]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children
[2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:48.920]  will do it to its senior citizens.
[2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:51.920]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:54.920]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police,
[2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:56.920]  on its army, on its prison guards,
[2:07:56.920 --> 2:08:00.920]  on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[2:08:00.920 --> 2:08:03.920]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:05.920]  The scoops are on their way.
[2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:10.920]  The scoops are on their way.
[2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:14.920]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:17.920]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:21.920]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:23.920]  We've got to stop them.
[2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:28.920]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:31.920]  Soylent Green is people!
[2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:36.920]  Next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food.
[2:08:36.920 --> 2:08:39.920]  You've got to tell them.
[2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:44.920]  So, Mike Adams, finishing up with the coronavirus
[2:08:44.920 --> 2:08:46.920]  and the prediction of where this is going,
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:49.920]  I see it from SARS as we predict an in-game,
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:52.920]  as a scale-up, the train is for drilling,
[2:08:52.920 --> 2:08:54.920]  the train is for world government,
[2:08:54.920 --> 2:08:57.920]  and of course Bill Mulligan say that as well.
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:09:01.920]  And it's definitely big, it's definitely bad.
[2:09:01.920 --> 2:09:03.920]  How big do you think it's going to get?
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:05.920]  How bad is it?
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:08.920]  Well, we know that part of the agenda here is
[2:09:08.920 --> 2:09:10.920]  indoctrination training and also quarantine training.
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:15.920]  So, whether or not this is the big kill virus
[2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:18.920]  or some other future virus is still unknown.
[2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:21.920]  The death rate, fatality rate from this virus
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:23.920]  is not yet high enough to kill a billion people,
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:26.920]  but it could kill tens of millions as projected in the software.
[2:09:26.920 --> 2:09:29.920]  But it will most certainly provide the precedent
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:32.920]  for a total police state lockdown of the United States
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:34.920]  and every major city in America.
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:38.920]  And that agenda is really a pretext agenda
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:41.920]  to make sure that they can declare emergency orders
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:43.920]  and just blame the coronavirus.
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:45.920]  Just like they blame climate change for everything
[2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:48.920]  and say we have to stop using combustion engines.
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:51.920]  We have to stop farming with diesel-powered tractors.
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:53.920]  They blame climate change for that.
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:57.920]  So, coronavirus will be the go-to blame object
[2:09:57.920 --> 2:09:59.920]  to say you have to give up all your rights.
[2:09:59.920 --> 2:10:01.920]  You're not allowed to speak online
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:03.920]  because you're speaking out against the CDC.
[2:10:03.920 --> 2:10:05.920]  You're not allowed to use natural medicine
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:07.920]  because it's not approved by the CDC.
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:09.920]  And that if you use natural medicine,
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:11.920]  you might spread the worsening virus.
[2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:14.920]  I'm telling you, Alex, you know how they do this.
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:16.920]  They're going to use this as a pretext
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:19.920]  for every major narrative and every crackdown.
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:21.920]  Well, that's it. I mean, we don't just sit here
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:23.920]  and make up stuff and then it comes true.
[2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:26.920]  We know it's all formulaic with them.
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:29.920]  And, again, it's like they're aliens
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:31.920]  that want to sabotage human development.
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:33.920]  They poison everything. They kill the earth
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:35.920]  while saying they support it.
[2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:37.920]  They sabotage all clean human development
[2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:39.920]  like a pack of gremlins.
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:42.920]  Whatever they are, whatever these globalists are,
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:44.920]  they're just super bad.
[2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:46.920]  But the thing is they work in coordination
[2:10:46.920 --> 2:10:48.920]  because they're getting a transmission mic.
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:50.920]  This is a scientist, as you are.
[2:10:50.920 --> 2:10:53.920]  I just scientifically look at the equations
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:10:56.920]  and it's like this is an anti-human force.
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:10:58.920]  Like you said, what do you call them?
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:00.920]  They're the anti-humans.
[2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:02.920]  Whatever you want to call globalists,
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:04.920]  they call themselves humanists, you notice,
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:06.920]  but they're not. They're the opposite.
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:08.920]  Yeah, they're the opposite.
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:10.920]  Just like the mainstream media gets talking points every day,
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:12.920]  which is why they sound identical
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:14.920]  when they're covering this impeachment trial.
[2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:16.920]  They sound identical.
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:18.920]  They use identical words and phrases every day.
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:20.920]  They use identical expressions.
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:22.920]  But the same type of thing is happening to the globalists
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:24.920]  and the CDC and the FDA and the drug companies.
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:26.920]  They get orders. They're told what to do.
[2:11:26.920 --> 2:11:28.920]  They're told, hey, manufacture this vaccine
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:30.920]  and put live viruses in it.
[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:32.920]  We're going to start a second wave.
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:34.920]  And by the way, it's all compartmentalized.
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:36.920]  Just like you'll have good cops guarding
[2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:38.920]  the Bilderberg Group meeting from the media.
[2:11:38.920 --> 2:11:40.920]  They're being enslaved by it as well.
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:42.920]  The head you inside is like,
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:44.920]  we're killing people. We're covering it up.
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:46.920]  This is wrong. We should fix this.
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:48.920]  They're like, we aren't allowed to do tests.
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:50.920]  Even the head you in scientists
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:52.920]  doesn't know what's going on.
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:54.920]  She says, corporations just tell us what to do.
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:56.920]  Well, that's right.
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:11:58.920]  And every scientist who's a whistleblower
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:00.920]  is eliminated from the system.
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:02.920]  Not just eliminated.
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:04.920]  Thousands of scientists have been run over,
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:06.920]  shot, killed. That's who they really target.
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:08.920]  Because if they can't buy you
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:10.920]  with underage girls or money
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:12.920]  like Bill and Melinda Gates are doing through Epstein,
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.920]  they ran Epstein.
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:16.920]  That's confirmed now.
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:18.920]  That's mainstream news, folks.
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:20.920]  They will kill you ass.
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:22.920]  The former EPA scientist who I interviewed
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:24.920]  in my BioSludge film,
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:26.920]  in his book, he documents
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:28.920]  how the CDC
[2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:30.920]  and the EPA were involved
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:32.920]  in sending a SWAT team
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:34.920]  of armed federal agents to his house
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:36.920]  at night, dragged him out of his house.
[2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:38.920]  This was a scientist. This was like a
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:40.920]  geeky science guy, dragged him out of his house
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:42.920]  and said, if you don't shut up, we're going to kill you.
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:44.920]  It's in his book.
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:46.920]  This is what they do and
[2:12:46.920 --> 2:12:48.920]  anybody who's
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:50.920]  opposed to the system or blowing the whistle on the system
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:52.920]  is threatened or eliminated.
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:54.920]  Let me raise this for you, though.
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:56.920]  Trump is a beachhead
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:12:58.920]  and
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:00.920]  I can tell you, and it's not about kissing their ass,
[2:13:00.920 --> 2:13:02.920]  but the police and the military
[2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:04.920]  and the actual killers now know
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:06.920]  they're supposed to be replaced by now
[2:13:06.920 --> 2:13:08.920]  by machines and robots and drones.
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:10.920]  That's why, oh, Bezos wants billions
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:12.920]  of drones, deliver stuff. No.
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:14.920]  They're not meant to deliver. They're meant to get you used to them.
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:16.920]  They're watching their house. They're watching what you do.
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:18.920]  They're in telling everything
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:20.920]  about you into the AI
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:22.920]  for when it makes Skynet makes its move.
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:24.920]  That's why they're so mad about in-game.
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:26.920]  And I'm not just saying that, folks. That's high level.
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:28.920]  The military finally gets, wait,
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:30.920]  Skynet's taking over. It's in slow motion.
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:32.920]  We're about to be eliminated.
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:34.920]  So every person I talk
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:36.920]  to who's talked to everybody else says,
[2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:38.920]  the globalists already have
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:40.920]  armored redoubts in New Zealand,
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:42.920]  Kauai, Hawaii,
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:44.920]  and Tasmania,
[2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:46.920]  Australia. They believe
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:48.920]  it'll be like a year-long global war.
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:50.920]  They want to stop nukes.
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:52.920]  They have special forces go in to take over
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:54.920]  the nuke bases in Pakistan everywhere.
[2:13:54.920 --> 2:13:56.920]  They've got global elites have a deal, like a moon raker,
[2:13:56.920 --> 2:13:58.920]  how they're going to eliminate everybody
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:00.920]  and how they're going to stabilize nuclear power plants
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:02.920]  during it. But I've talked to
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:04.920]  the people. The fact is, the minute
[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:06.920]  all these people are in some red
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:08.920]  doubt
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:10.920]  and they'll even be a combat robot there
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:12.920]  and drones watching and robots watching the troops,
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:14.920]  the troops aren't dumb. They get it.
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:16.920]  The minute, just like a soldier
[2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:18.920]  or an officer gives an order to kill
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:20.920]  men, women and children, the soldiers turn their guns,
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:22.920]  the default by the human
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:24.920]  human resistance,
[2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:26.920]  because the computers didn't get
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:28.920]  didn't get put. What I'm saying, folks, is the biggest secret
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:30.920]  ever. Now
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:32.920]  the military, the human element
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:34.920]  realizes they're being replaced
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:36.920]  and the default without any orders coming down
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:38.920]  is they're going to kill all the globalists
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:40.920]  the minute they kick this off. And that's not a bluff
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:42.920]  or a threat.
[2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:44.920]  We're going to have 90% decapitation
[2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:46.920]  within days of them
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:48.920]  pulling this off, Mike.
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:50.920]  In fact, those who are in the most denial
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:52.920]  of this, the leftists, the liberals,
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:54.920]  they are the ones who are going to
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:56.920]  be the first victims of it.
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:14:58.920]  They're cities that are ripe
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:00.920]  for coronavirus infections or other pandemics
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:02.920]  that are released and by weapons.
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:04.920]  I agree with you. You've got to do five more minutes
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:06.920]  and I know Rapport's coming over. He'll be in the middle
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:08.920]  of the next segment, but you've got to get into the attack
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:10.920]  on your site and these injunctions
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:12.920]  and how criminal it is
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:14.920]  on somebody else's lawsuit. You're not even
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:16.920]  involved in a shadowy Obama judge,
[2:15:16.920 --> 2:15:18.920]  but did you just hear what I said, Mike?
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:20.920]  I know you talked a lot of the same people.
[2:15:20.920 --> 2:15:22.920]  The military
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:24.920]  and everybody gets that the Skynet
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:26.920]  takeover is real, but it's incremental
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:28.920]  and that it didn't happen like it was
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:30.920]  supposed to and they all
[2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:32.920]  understand now what's happening and the humans
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:34.920]  are guarding the globalist.
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:36.920]  So if the globalists ever try
[2:15:36.920 --> 2:15:38.920]  this plan, they're all dead.
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:40.920]  I mean, I just said the biggest secret
[2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:42.920]  ever. That's not bluffing. Everybody knows
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:44.920]  I don't say something less real.
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:46.920]  You understand? On my soul,
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:48.920]  you're all dead, globalist.
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:16:00.920]  You do this. You're dead.
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:20.920]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move
[2:16:20.920 --> 2:16:22.920]  a lot of our inventory to a temporary
[2:16:22.920 --> 2:16:24.920]  location and rather than move it back
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:26.920]  to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:28.920]  at a price that might seem unbelievable
[2:16:28.920 --> 2:16:30.920]  if you didn't know the floodwater's
[2:16:30.920 --> 2:16:32.920]  backstory. So here's what you should do right now.

[2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:54.920]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:56.920]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:16:58.920]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:00.920]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS
[2:17:00.920 --> 2:17:02.920]  then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:04.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:06.920]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:08.920]  they thought might never be solved.
[2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:10.920]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay,
[2:17:10.920 --> 2:17:12.920]  don't wait another day.

[2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:00.920]  You don't want my thanks.
[2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:02.920]  You want victory over the globalist
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:04.920]  and these devil worship and child molesters
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:06.920]  and you want them off your back and off your children's back
[2:18:06.920 --> 2:18:08.920]  and you know what, I'm the same way

[2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:12.920]  and that's why M4 has been delivering
[2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:14.920]  time and time again
[2:18:14.920 --> 2:18:16.920]  when it's clutch time
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:18.920]  to focus the people
[2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:20.920]  on taking action against the globalist
[2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:22.920]  because I'm committed to a future
[2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:24.920]  for humanity
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:26.920]  and I know you are as well.
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:28.920]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:30.920]  because you are the M4 war and I want to thank you
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:32.920]  for committing to stand with us in 2020
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:34.920]  however you can.
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:36.920]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:38.920]  and for the great crew at M4 wars
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:40.920]  because you are the M4 war

[2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:46.920]  We have made history together.
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:48.920]  M4Wars.com
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:50.920]  only has power because of you
[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:52.920]  and I suggest you use it.
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:18:56.920]  Hey, you there.
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:18:58.920]  We have a problem.
[2:18:58.920 --> 2:19:00.920]  You see, there is a baby.
[2:19:00.920 --> 2:19:02.920]  The mother of this baby
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:04.920]  is not sure she's ready.
[2:19:04.920 --> 2:19:06.920]  The father of this baby
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:08.920]  doesn't want to settle down.
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:10.920]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:12.920]  The father
[2:19:12.920 --> 2:19:14.920]  considers leaving town.
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:16.920]  But a friend says
[2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:18.920]  there's a solution.
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:20.920]  She says to have
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:22.920]  an abortion.
[2:19:22.920 --> 2:19:24.920]  The mother decides to look into it.
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:26.920]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:28.920]  She's made her decision.
[2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:30.920]  She's going to have an abortion.
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:32.920]  The problem is
[2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:34.920]  that baby
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:36.920]  is you.
[2:20:04.920 --> 2:20:06.920]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[2:20:06.920 --> 2:20:08.920]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:34.920]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:38.920]  It's not slowing down.
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:40.920]  It's getting pound for pound.
[2:20:40.920 --> 2:20:42.920]  All right.
[2:20:42.920 --> 2:20:44.920]  Mike Adams in closing.
[2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:46.920]  We're going to go to
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:48.920]  John Rappaport here.
[2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:50.920]  Investigative journals for this take on things.
[2:20:50.920 --> 2:20:52.920]  The attack on you
[2:20:52.920 --> 2:20:54.920]  and what you've learned.
[2:20:54.920 --> 2:20:56.920]  You've sent me the documents.
[2:20:56.920 --> 2:20:58.920]  You've sent the judge what's happening in California.
[2:20:58.920 --> 2:21:00.920]  In a court case you're not even involved in
[2:21:00.920 --> 2:21:02.920]  taking down all these sites
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:04.920]  and you're talking about the coronavirus.
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:06.920]  That's really a martial law level
[2:21:06.920 --> 2:21:08.920]  event.
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:10.920]  And it's really illustrative of how
[2:21:10.920 --> 2:21:12.920]  the system has escalated things
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:14.920]  to a level of just brazen criminality
[2:21:14.920 --> 2:21:16.920]  showing that they're going for broke
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:18.920]  because they would normally go to jail for this
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:20.920]  or get in major trouble.
[2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:22.920]  I know you're filing a criminal complaint today with your lawyers.
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:24.920]  This is just insane lawlessness
[2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:26.920]  but they're testing to see what they can get away with
[2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:28.920]  because big financial backers
[2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:30.920]  have told them do it.
[2:21:30.920 --> 2:21:32.920]  It's just insane lawlessness
[2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:34.920]  which is here and we've been hit by it.
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:36.920]  It's a test case against us
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:38.920]  and even as your own attorney Norm
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:40.920]  said yesterday
[2:21:40.920 --> 2:21:42.920]  federal statutes require
[2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:44.920]  parties to be given notice
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:46.920]  and to be given an opportunity for a hearing.
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:48.920]  We were given none of those opportunities.
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:50.920]  We were taken down by a temporary restraining
[2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:52.920]  order that had nothing
[2:21:52.920 --> 2:21:54.920]  to do with us in the original case.
[2:21:54.920 --> 2:21:56.920]  What they did that what they're doing Alex is they're recycling
[2:21:56.920 --> 2:21:58.920]  and hijacking old California
[2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:00.920]  and they have nothing to do with us
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:02.920]  and we now learn that they filed this
[2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:04.920]  TRO, they reopened an old case
[2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:06.920]  they filed the TRO
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:08.920]  at the last hour of the last day of the year
[2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:10.920]  last year so it was actually December 31st
[2:22:10.920 --> 2:22:12.920]  So they did it so law clerks wouldn't even
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:14.920]  review it. It's corporate level
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:16.920]  mega espionage.
[2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:18.920]  And it says we have the documents
[2:22:18.920 --> 2:22:20.920]  it says no hearings
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:22.920]  blatantly illegal, blatantly unconstitutional.
[2:22:22.920 --> 2:22:24.920]  We also know by the way
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:26.920]  we now have names of some of the other infrastructure providers
[2:22:26.920 --> 2:22:28.920]  who are being hit by this it includes
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:30.920]  Cloudflare, it includes hosting companies
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:32.920]  like Bluehost and it includes
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:34.920]  email service providers such as Hushmail
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:36.920]  and by the way Hushmail told this judge
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:38.920]  go f yourself
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:40.920]  by the way Hushmail said we're not going to comply
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:42.920]  with this ridiculous order so good on
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:44.920]  Hushmail but other infrastructure
[2:22:44.920 --> 2:22:46.920]  providers are in fact complying with it
[2:22:46.920 --> 2:22:48.920]  to sabotage.
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:50.920]  But let's go further. Courts have never done this
[2:22:50.920 --> 2:22:52.920]  in modern history. This is beyond
[2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:54.920]  banana republic. This this means
[2:22:54.920 --> 2:22:56.920]  they believe there's a takedown
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:22:58.920]  of Trump. I guess that means that they were told
[2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:00.920]  the senate trials there were going to remove
[2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:02.920]  Trump and they they see the democrat confidence
[2:23:02.920 --> 2:23:04.920]  act so they believe
[2:23:04.920 --> 2:23:06.920]  that they could do things that are unprecedented.
[2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:08.920]  I keep going back to that it means
[2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:10.920]  they're going for broke it means they're just
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:12.920]  committing crime openly.
[2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:14.920]  Well looking for three days I haven't been able to cover
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:16.920]  coronavirus on my own website because
[2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:18.920]  I've been scrambling around you know calling lawyers
[2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:20.920]  and doing these other things so they have
[2:23:20.920 --> 2:23:22.920]  delayed they have
[2:23:22.920 --> 2:23:24.920]  what shows you a lot of big powerful
[2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:26.920]  groups have put a lot of marbles on corona.
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:28.920]  Oh yeah doesn't it though
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:30.920]  doesn't it because I should have a dozen articles
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:32.920]  out by now but I don't
[2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:34.920]  because of this so look they
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:36.920]  they can take you down or interfere with
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:38.920]  your. Let's say they've got maps Mike they know
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:40.920]  that's you or Merkola in
[2:23:40.920 --> 2:23:42.920]  in health news nine times out of ten
[2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:44.920]  that changes the game I mean it's true you're
[2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:46.920]  badass I mean you you literally are like
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:48.920]  a Super Bowl champ you and Merkola and a few others
[2:23:48.920 --> 2:23:50.920]  and so they're like let's take them out
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:52.920]  and of course you go check Merkola and others I know
[2:23:52.920 --> 2:23:54.920]  they're getting suppressed too right now I mean and
[2:23:54.920 --> 2:23:56.920]  that's why we're I've made a big deal but people
[2:23:56.920 --> 2:23:58.920]  see cloud flare in front of us
[2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:00.920]  is the highest level of protection
[2:24:00.920 --> 2:24:02.920]  the giant the knowledge service attacks
[2:24:02.920 --> 2:24:04.920]  everything else are the levels like
[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:06.920]  like ten times bigger than Himalayas
[2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:08.920]  like previous attacks the biggest was like
[2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:10.920]  I mean so it's like not even
[2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:12.920]  and like you said you've gotten numb
[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:14.920]  I don't mean that to be mean
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:16.920]  I can only operate to be numb because
[2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:18.920]  the attacks are coming in so fast
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:20.920]  that it's like I become like a robot myself like
[2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:22.920]  fight back a fight back but just
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:24.920]  at a certain point I used to care
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:26.920]  I did this because I cared now I did it
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:28.920]  because I default set the position
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:30.920]  and ran it in the overdrive but now
[2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:32.920]  I have become I'm just telling
[2:24:32.920 --> 2:24:34.920]  listeners I've literally become a robot in this fight
[2:24:34.920 --> 2:24:36.920]  Alex and the last thing I know
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:38.920]  you've got other guests coming up last
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:40.920]  last thing to mention you know this big explosion
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:42.920]  in Houston this
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:44.920]  this chemical plant exploded
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:46.920]  entire neighborhoods have been destroyed the police are telling
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:48.920]  people to look for body parts
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:50.920]  up to a mile away okay so this
[2:24:50.920 --> 2:24:52.920]  look we talked about sleeper cells
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:54.920]  being activated I don't know if that's what this is
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:56.920]  but this could be payback for the
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:24:58.920]  Salamani strike this could be
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:00.920]  you know Islamic radical
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:02.920]  extremist sleeper cells activating we need
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:04.920]  to we need to see if that's the case but Houston
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:06.920]  was one of the key targets so it may
[2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:08.920]  be happening we need to research further
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:10.920]  well there's no doubt
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:12.920]  that's a target and we should cover that alright
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:14.920]  Mike Adams amazing job please
[2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:16.920]  join me on the Sunday show
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:18.920]  4 to 6 p.m. and I'm doing a Saturday show
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:20.920]  as well thank you sir
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:22.920]  alright well joining
[2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:24.920]  us down I appreciate him holding as we got behind
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:26.920]  here is John Rappaport
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:28.920]  great patriot filmmaker investigative
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:30.920]  journalist no more fake news calm
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:32.920]  he's been under
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:34.920]  the novel service attack
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:36.920]  as well
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:38.920]  and he's here
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:40.920]  with us to talk about
[2:25:40.920 --> 2:25:42.920]  the big picture and then we'll drill
[2:25:42.920 --> 2:25:44.920]  down in the time we have
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:46.920]  about what's happening because intellectually
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:48.920]  I can see that things are exponentially
[2:25:48.920 --> 2:25:50.920]  by orders of magnitude more insane
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:52.920]  but then a spiritual level
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:54.920]  I don't want to say I'm
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:25:56.920]  poleaxed at this point but that's what Mike
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:25:58.920]  said he's almost I started
[2:25:58.920 --> 2:26:00.920]  I couldn't go on air for 20 minutes today
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:02.920]  because I'm in here doing hours
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:04.920]  of research before and
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:06.920]  and then
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:08.920]  my
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:10.920]  I just can't believe we're putting up
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:12.920]  with this but I see the seduction I see
[2:26:12.920 --> 2:26:14.920]  the incrementalism but I just
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:16.920]  I'm now coming to the point of like we're
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:18.920]  in a state of war and
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:20.920]  this is totally insane how would you
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:22.920]  quantify where we are right now John
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:24.920]  Rappaport
[2:26:24.920 --> 2:26:26.920]  well as you said Alex it's all about
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:28.920]  the attacks
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:30.920]  to try to make
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:32.920]  you and others
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:34.920]  spend all of your time
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:36.920]  defending against these various attacks
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:38.920]  so that you can't go about
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:40.920]  your work in the same way that you were
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:42.920]  doing before
[2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:44.920]  because you're fending off
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:46.920]  all the time because
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:48.920]  they've seen what the threat
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:50.920]  of free free speech
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:52.920]  is really all about
[2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:54.920]  there's no doubt about it now
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:56.920]  they understand we got this thing called
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:26:58.920]  the internet alright let's see what happens
[2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:00.920]  yeah well what happens is
[2:27:00.920 --> 2:27:02.920]  for the last 15-20 years
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:04.920]  all of a sudden people are waking up
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:06.920]  and they're saying well if I can
[2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:08.920]  actually communicate
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:10.920]  to large numbers of people about
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:12.920]  what's going on rather than
[2:27:12.920 --> 2:27:14.920]  you know in the old days when I used to give
[2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:16.920]  lectures back in the 80s
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:18.920]  and 90s there was a group
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:20.920]  that would come in there a couple of people
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:22.920]  and they would
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:24.920]  tape it audio tape and they'd make copies
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:26.920]  and they'd sell them
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:28.920]  and then I would get a letter from somebody
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:30.920]  in Bulgaria six months later
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:32.920]  saying I heard your
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:34.920]  tape on viruses
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:36.920]  and fantastic news
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:38.920]  and whatever you know
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:40.920]  so all of a sudden now it's instantaneous
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:42.920]  and they're seeing that
[2:27:42.920 --> 2:27:44.920]  they themselves are getting
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:46.920]  overwhelmed the enemy
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:48.920]  is getting overwhelmed so
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:50.920]  they have to strike back and they have to destroy
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:52.920]  that's right they see humanity making the right
[2:27:52.920 --> 2:27:54.920]  decision when given the opportunity
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:56.920]  exactly
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:27:58.920]  so we say to you
[2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:00.920]  alright let's try free speech
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:02.920]  out and see what happens and
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:04.920]  lo and behold what does happen
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:06.920]  people wake up
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:08.920]  people begin investigating on their own
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:10.920]  I remember you could say this was
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:12.920]  the dawn of the internet back around
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:14.920]  1996-97
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:16.920]  the Oklahoma City bombing
[2:28:16.920 --> 2:28:18.920]  when citizens in the city
[2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:20.920]  got together and formed
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:22.920]  under state representative
[2:28:22.920 --> 2:28:24.920]  Charles Key their own
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:26.920]  citizen grand jury
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:28.920]  and all of a sudden
[2:28:28.920 --> 2:28:30.920]  you had smart people
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:32.920]  not just smart people
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:34.920]  brilliant people investigators
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:36.920]  that went out way beyond
[2:28:36.920 --> 2:28:38.920]  and exposed Bill Clinton blew that building up
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:40.920]  with a CIA and FBI to blame America
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:42.920]  they just
[2:28:42.920 --> 2:28:44.920]  found out so many secrets
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:46.920]  and conspiracies and plots
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:48.920]  and so forth they had the names I've interviewed
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:50.920]  the police went public to them
[2:28:50.920 --> 2:29:00.920]  we'll be right back
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:22.920]  to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:24.920]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[2:29:24.920 --> 2:29:26.920]  we thought we'd offer the system
[2:29:26.920 --> 2:29:28.920]  at a price that might seem unbelievable
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:30.920]  if you didn't know the flood waters backstory
[2:29:30.920 --> 2:29:32.920]  so here's what you should do right now
[2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:34.920]  check out the ppx microgrid system
[2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:36.920]  at myownpowergrid.com
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:38.920]  that's myownpowergrid.com

[2:29:40.920 --> 2:29:42.920]  off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too
[2:29:42.920 --> 2:29:44.920]  and the best part you're not going to pay
[2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:46.920]  750 or 500 dollars 300

[2:29:50.920 --> 2:29:52.920]  that's myownpowergrid.com
[2:29:52.920 --> 2:29:54.920]  I've got to really
[2:29:54.920 --> 2:29:56.920]  hand it to the listeners
[2:29:56.920 --> 2:29:58.920]  and viewers from Full Wars
[2:29:58.920 --> 2:30:00.920]  your support and your help
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:02.920]  in rebooting Americana
[2:30:02.920 --> 2:30:04.920]  is a challenge to the globalist system
[2:30:04.920 --> 2:30:06.920]  of corporate tyranny has really caught hold
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:08.920]  not just here in the U.S.
[2:30:08.920 --> 2:30:10.920]  but worldwide and President Trump's
[2:30:10.920 --> 2:30:12.920]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting
[2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:14.920]  Americana and basic liberty
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:16.920]  is amazing as well
[2:30:16.920 --> 2:30:18.920]  still lacking on the big tech censorship
[2:30:18.920 --> 2:30:20.920]  taking action against that
[2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:22.920]  in some other areas but
[2:30:22.920 --> 2:30:24.920]  trying to end the wars, boosting our economy
[2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:26.920]  speaking out against communist China
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:28.920]  Trump's been doing an amazing job
[2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:30.920]  but now more than ever
[2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:32.920]  we really have to realize that
[2:30:32.920 --> 2:30:34.920]  we're being targeted because we are effective
[2:30:34.920 --> 2:30:36.920]  and the globalists are beginning to lose
[2:30:36.920 --> 2:30:38.920]  their war
[2:30:38.920 --> 2:30:40.920]  against humanity in a big way
[2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:42.920]  and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:44.920]  but it's critical to not let ourselves
[2:30:44.920 --> 2:30:46.920]  get down when we see all the poison
[2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:48.920]  they spray at us
[2:30:48.920 --> 2:30:50.920]  that's an attempt to demoralize us

[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:14.920]  researchers in France notice
[2:31:14.920 --> 2:31:16.920]  that people who ate certain quail eggs
[2:31:16.920 --> 2:31:18.920]  experience less seasonal
[2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:20.920]  immune and inflammatory responses
[2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:22.920]  they began studying this effect
[2:31:22.920 --> 2:31:24.920]  in published trials and decades later
[2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:26.920]  we now have the fruit of this research

[2:31:36.920 --> 2:31:38.920]  in fact current research has found that it actually
[2:31:38.920 --> 2:31:40.920]  acts by blocking the activity
[2:31:40.920 --> 2:31:42.920]  of triptase which is an enzyme

[2:33:17.920 --> 2:33:32.840]  Jones show. We are in the heart of the resistance. It's true. It's not a title. It's not a brag.
[2:33:32.840 --> 2:33:45.920]  It's a distress signal. We're in the fight. We've already seen incredible victory. The
[2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:51.880]  enemy is attacking. If you duplicate what we've done and build on it and expand, we're going to win.
[2:33:51.880 --> 2:33:57.560]  Whatever happens, dies. We did the right thing. We had big victories against the globalist. I can
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:04.400]  tell you that right now. And as soon as we get North Paterson Align, constitutional lawyer has
[2:34:04.400 --> 2:34:09.760]  been there doing a great job. We will give you the news on Owen Troyer that just came out minutes
[2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:16.360]  ago. And I know that John Rappaport of NoMoreFakeNews.com will understand we'll do a few minutes
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:23.200]  with him. Owen arrested for peacefully putting a piece of tape over his mouth in the Senate foyer.
[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:27.480]  But going back to John Rappaport, we'll hold it a little bit at the next hour. Dr. Nick
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:31.080]  Begach had to be able to hold. Owen's not out as yell yet. I'm told we'll have the announcement
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:42.080]  here in just a moment. John, the gestalt. Obviously, this is ridiculously transparent for those of us
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:48.520]  that have been studying it. But that's the fact about any mid-globalist role out as it's planetary.
[2:34:48.520 --> 2:34:54.440]  So it's very standardized. It's very slow-moving. But once you hit the point of event horizon or
[2:34:54.440 --> 2:35:00.480]  implementation out of beta, it becomes lightning fast. The depopulation program, what's really
[2:35:00.480 --> 2:35:04.840]  being put in the vaccines, the UN coming out admitting it's killing people. There's a cover-up,
[2:35:04.840 --> 2:35:11.280]  which I saw as a cry for help. The gestalt-prime computation, where are we right now? And where
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:21.560]  are the globalists? Alex, I can't hear you. All right. Well, we're doing some board training today.
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:26.600]  I'm not sure why we do it on my show, but only my show. I'm asking you where we are as a culture
[2:35:26.600 --> 2:35:34.760]  and a species. John, report. On the break, I was thinking about what we were talking about. Two
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:40.720]  things. One is they want to try to push you into doing something that you would never do. Whatever
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:47.640]  that is, something so outrageous and outlandish and illegal that they would then be in the pounce on
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:53.960]  you. It's like, okay, how much pressure can we put on this guy to get him to do something that he
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:36:00.320]  would never do, where there is no longer any possible doubt of guilt and so on and so forth? I
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:06.720]  mean, that's one of their traditional tactics. And the other thing as a culture, the bigger picture,
[2:36:06.720 --> 2:36:14.080]  what they're trying to do is to say, good is evil and evil is good. This is a way we're going to
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:20.760]  ultimately confuse your mind, heart, spirit, soul, consciousness, everything. We're going to show
[2:36:20.760 --> 2:36:27.280]  you the opposite of everything the way it actually is and convince you that this is so. So everything
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:31.960]  you thought was good actually turns out to be evil and everything you thought was evil actually
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:37.440]  turns out to be good. What do you know about that? This is now the brave new world and isn't it
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:44.840]  wonderful? And though at every level and every operation, every covert op, every cultural operation,
[2:36:44.840 --> 2:36:51.680]  this is what they're doing. They're turning everything upside down and inside out with that premise
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:37:01.000]  in mind that they're going to totally bury the population in its own moral, ethical, spiritual,
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:08.960]  emotional confusion by turning everything around 180 degrees from the way it actually is.
[2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:14.600]  Why do they fear, let me ask you this, and we've got to pass the line, we're going to go to him,
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:20.160]  continue with you, John Rapport. Why? Because it's not about bragging. And I don't totally trust
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:24.920]  Trump either. He's had problems. Why do they fear Trump? Why do they fear him for wars? Why are
[2:37:24.920 --> 2:37:31.840]  they trying to shut you down right now? Why do they fear Mike Adams? Well, because there's truth
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:39.880]  there. Truth is more contagious than any virus. Truth spreads. People say, well, he just said this.
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:46.760]  That's true. He just said, they're trying to make America into part of a new world order,
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:52.240]  globalism, whatever you want to call it. Well, every time I look around, that's what I see too.
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:38:01.240]  So they fear self evidence. Yes, exactly. Where how could you possibly deny what's being said?
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:09.120]  You know, now we're giving these guys a free platform to say these things. So naturally,
[2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:14.680]  they're going to be afraid, especially when the numbers begin to expand exponentially. And you've
[2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:19.920]  got millions of people listening to you and watching you. And Mike Adams does and other people as
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:26.440]  well. Of course, they're going to do that. They're going to say, my God, you know, this is spinning
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:31.880]  out of control. We had no idea this was going to happen yet, because self evident truth spreads.
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:36.920]  John Rababort, normalfectnews.com. We're coming back to you in a moment. We have breaking news.
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:44.640]  Owen Shroyer was arrested for the second time, not for during the impeachment final vote with
[2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:51.120]  Nadler saying you're the tyrant. That huge viral event. But he's there in the foyer of the Senate.
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:54.680]  There's all these Democrat demonstrators. They're constantly yelling, screaming, holding up signs.
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:39:00.240]  He puts tape over his mouth. They arrest him for that. And Norm Patis, famous constitutional
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:04.240]  lawyer, very honored to have him. He got on a train when it happened in your state,
[2:39:04.240 --> 2:39:10.280]  racedown, racedown today. He was there. Owen is not a jail yet. So I don't know the details,
[2:39:10.280 --> 2:39:15.640]  but I'm told some good news just happened. Norm Patis tells us what's happening. Yeah,
[2:39:15.640 --> 2:39:19.400]  it is excellent news. The rule of law one today. I mean, the first amendment one,
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:24.480]  the government decided to quote unquote no paper the case. In other words, although Owen was arrested,
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:28.960]  and held overnight as a common criminal, he's walking out the door with the charges dismissed
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:33.960]  free as he was before he walked in the door. So, you know, he should never have been arrested in
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:38.680]  the first instance. I'd encourage your viewers to look at his protest. He had a piece of duct tape
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:43.000]  over his mouth that said censored. And he was carrying a sign that said big tech tried to
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:47.640]  censor me. Now the Democrats are too. And then he alerted people to ban that video where you
[2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:53.280]  can see truth spoken. Capitol police came and warned him to knock it off. He said,
[2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:59.600]  what about the people who were here protesting earlier on behalf of the impeachment? Why didn't
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:04.560]  you arrest them? It was a tense standoff. They arrested him in handcuffs and took him out of
[2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:09.600]  the building at about 1220 yesterday, I believe. He was held overnight in a metropolitan jail.
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:15.280]  He has not yet been released. It'll be an hour or so by the time the deep state processes its
[2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:21.520]  paperwork, but he will be free and we won. So it's a good day. A good day for the first amendment,
[2:40:21.520 --> 2:40:28.080]  a good day for Owen Schreuer, a good day for the resistance. I agree. What is the answer to the
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:33.760]  question? Who gave the order because they let people protest out there all the time. Why did
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:38.400]  they go after his silent protest when the Democrats are there every day running around? Code pinks
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:43.120]  in the committee hearings flailing around. Jane Fonda has charges dropped every every week against
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:47.440]  her literally every week. She's there for those don't know on Fridays. She gets arrested all the
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:51.680]  time. Why did who gave the orders of the police to do this? Because look, it's not about kissing
[2:40:51.680 --> 2:40:57.520]  the police ass. They were ordered to do this. There is a law in place. Why were they selectively
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:02.000]  enforcing norm? I don't know. And one of the reasons I suspect one of the reasons the case
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:06.800]  was dropped is we were going to find out an answer to that question. So there is a DC,
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:12.400]  a statute in the District of Columbia that prohibits demonstrating in that building,
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:18.320]  whether Owen's conduct constituted a demonstration or not is unclear. We were going to challenge that
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:23.760]  on facial grounds saying that the statute's unconstitutional in that in that context. Well,
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:28.720]  plus it's defining speech as demonstration. Demonstration is a big group blocking a road
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:33.920]  under. Let's talk about that. Keep going. Reasonable reasonable minds can disagree about
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:37.600]  that and will. That's why there are so many books in a lawyer's office. The more interesting
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:43.200]  question to my mind is why was this law selectively applied? And so we were gathering information,
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:47.440]  and I don't know if all of your viewers have yet seen the videotape of the removed Trump folks,
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:52.080]  where Owen confronted folks two days earlier. That was far more obvious than anything that
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:58.560]  Owen did, and none of those people were arrested. So our first set of tasks on discovery in the
[2:41:58.560 --> 2:42:03.200]  course of litigation would have been to find out who gave the order for his arrest. The fact that
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:07.680]  the case has been dropped means now that no one will ever be forced to answer that question,
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:13.200]  unless Owen decides to bring civil litigation for false arrest. And, you know, that's a topic
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:17.600]  that he'll have to decide and whether that's worth doing. Well, I'm just going to say this.
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:22.960]  It's where the Info Wars audience was more important than Alan Jones or Owen Troyer.
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:27.840]  And folks, I'm not kissing your ass. I want you to get this to your head. Everything is energy
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:34.480]  credits. You bankrolled us. I could send a top lawyer. You bankrolled us. I could put Owen there.
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:42.240]  Your money did all this. You understand that? Go to infowarstore.com. I want that money for war.
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:48.720]  I want that money to fight tyrants and pedophiles. Give me your money, and I swear I'll wage a
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:57.120]  turn to war. Stay with us. We have been fighting so hard in the last two weeks that I've not even
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:02.800]  had time to cut new audio ads for this huge syndicated radio audience. And I apologize to
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:06.880]  radio listeners. I apologize. The fact I'm cutting this on a phone as I drive on the road,
[2:43:06.880 --> 2:43:12.400]  but this is a war. We're getting it done anyway we can. But we had huge sales in the new year
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:18.880]  around Christmas end of the new year. But we sold the products at such low prices
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:23.840]  that it didn't bring in a lot of actual capital to fund our operations. And I'm expending
[2:43:24.720 --> 2:43:29.520]  massive amounts of money to put more than 15 people in Virginia, more than 10 people in
[2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:35.600]  DC all next week for the trial of Trump. It's so critical we're there to confront the globalist
[2:43:35.600 --> 2:43:39.840]  and put out the counter narrative of the truth to what they're doing. This is a real fight.

[2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:50.400]  Wars team. Show Owen, David, Alex, Savannah and everyone else behind the scenes you stand with
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:57.440]  them in the fight against tyranny today. If you understand why the globalist, why the servants
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:04.640]  of Satan hate Info Wars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate and we're not
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:10.480]  giving up. That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:15.200]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:21.200]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have
[2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:26.240]  literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[2:45:26.240 --> 2:45:31.760]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:39.200]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:45.920]  and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:56.880]  are alive. They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.

[2:46:57.120 --> 2:46:59.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:06.400 --> 2:47:10.560]  Well, I was thumbing from Montgomery. I had my guitar on my back.
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:17.120]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac. He was dressed.
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:25.280]  He was dressed like 1950. Half drunk and hollow eyed. He said it's a long walk to Nashville.
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:33.280]  Would you like to ride? Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:41.440]  front lines of the info war. You know, my dad's dad died when I was five years old. Maybe six when
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:48.160]  I was the first grade. And I remember growing up and thinking how beautiful my mama was
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:55.760]  and how good my dad was. I remember when I see my grandfather. I was just a child, but I was like,
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:48:04.080]  man, that's a strong man right there. That's a good looking man. I mean, he was a strong guy.
[2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:12.160]  Taxin all the way. Part Comanche. Like beautiful brown skin. Big blue eyes. Six, three. I mean,
[2:48:12.160 --> 2:48:17.120]  look tougher than John Wayne, man. And when he died of cancer and I was at his funeral when I was
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:23.200]  six years old, that hit me really hard. And I only mentioned something like that
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:29.520]  because people expect info wars to be strong and hold the fight. But I got to tell you
[2:48:33.680 --> 2:48:42.400]  we're strong, but not that strong. And I can tell you that I sit up here and ask for your support
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:49.120]  all day long. I don't like even asking for your support. But it just comes down to the fact that
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:54.320]  if you don't support us, we're not going to be here. Everything the enemy does is about suppressing
[2:48:54.320 --> 2:49:02.400]  these guests and the information, the stories we cover. I'm just got to be the guy that's willing
[2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:08.480]  to try to tie it all together and get the people in line to take action and then pay the bills.
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:12.240]  So there's a platform to get this done. And I know God appointed me for this.
[2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:18.240]  I know it's my mission and I'm willing to go all the way. And I'm not scared of the devil or the
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:24.000]  New World Order, but I'm scared of giving out. And I'm far from that, man. I can feel my RPMs
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:30.240]  rammed up to full. I feel like I'm an invincible, but I'm not an arrogant person. And I know that
[2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:35.920]  it's you that's the wind and the sales. So I'm just telling you at this crossroads, everything
[2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:42.640]  they're doing is about suppressing we, the people. And God works in mysterious ways, but God works
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:47.120]  through men and women. Go back to John Rappaport. John, I'm going to shut up now. Get into the
[2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:52.320]  virus, get into the world, get into where you see things, get into the impeachment, the trial.
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:56.640]  Just, just pour it out, John Rapport. You're a, you're a sage. You're a smart guy. I respect you.
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:50:01.280]  I'm not kissing your ass. You're an amazing person. I love you. Where are we now together?
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:06.080]  Where are we now together? Because I don't want our strength to be for nothing. I want people to
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:12.000]  realize that our strength is only here now. And if people don't take the example of it,
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:16.720]  and if they don't expand on it and become greater than us, then it's all to fail. The Satanists
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:22.880]  want the power to them. We want the power to dissipate. We want to overcome this evil. We
[2:50:22.880 --> 2:50:27.840]  believe in the collective of humanity, but the individualism of the spirit. How do we
[2:50:27.840 --> 2:50:35.680]  telegraph that? And how are we strong? Strong, certainly, by starting with the individual, Alex,
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:44.720]  knowing what you need to do, knowing where the fight is, what the fight is,
[2:50:45.760 --> 2:50:52.080]  and the best way to do it, the best way to carry on the fight. One of the things that struck me
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:51:00.240]  right from the beginning, when I started working as a reporter in 1982, seems like a long time ago
[2:51:00.240 --> 2:51:07.120]  now, was there was all these people running around saying, you've got to have this injection in your
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:13.040]  body, and that injection in your body, and so on and so forth. That always seemed completely insane
[2:51:13.040 --> 2:51:18.640]  to me. And that was one of the ways that I got into what is the struggle all about.
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:23.200]  I'm talking about vaccines, of course, and vaccinations, and destroying the health of the
[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:28.560]  body. Outside groups saying, you must let us put something in you when we already have all our
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:36.240]  ancestors and what we are together. Exactly. What do you think the history of the human race is all
[2:51:36.240 --> 2:51:43.840]  about? It's about survival. It's about men and women choosing each other, injecting each other,
[2:51:43.840 --> 2:51:49.600]  injecting each other, and creating a life form. How Satanic is some company shooting something
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:54.080]  into you to change your genetics, and we're just supposed to trust them. That's Satanism.
[2:51:54.880 --> 2:52:00.320]  And when you, at least for me, when I started to look at that and think about it,
[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:08.080]  it just seemed completely insane and preposterous that people would allow this to happen. That was
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:13.760]  15, 20, 35 years ago. I should add this, to not kiss your asses, for instance, people know the
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:21.040]  timeline. You have been a pioneer in warning about vaccines. Yeah, because it started for me
[2:52:21.040 --> 2:52:28.320]  in college, actually, 1957, 58. I was in college, and all of a sudden this thing came down the
[2:52:28.320 --> 2:52:33.920]  pipeline called the Asian flu one winter. I had no idea what they were talking about.
[2:52:33.920 --> 2:52:37.920]  Everybody's got to get a vaccine. Everybody's got to get a vaccine. Otherwise,
[2:52:37.920 --> 2:52:44.000]  people are going to get sick. And I thought to myself, I'm not getting any vaccine. I'm not
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:48.880]  going to get sick. Are they crazy? What are they talking about? I mean, I don't know why I reacted
[2:52:48.880 --> 2:52:57.040]  that way. I didn't get sick. Other people got sick. And I started to develop this feeling
[2:52:57.040 --> 2:53:07.360]  that these medical people are doing something violent, strange, perverted, and they're trying
[2:53:07.360 --> 2:53:13.280]  to make it sound as normal as possible. And it's covert. And it's completely covert.
[2:53:14.640 --> 2:53:24.080]  And so that was my way in to seeing how evil could become the norm. And people would stand
[2:53:24.080 --> 2:53:29.360]  up and salute it. And of course, now we've gotten to the point where your complete pariah,
[2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:34.640]  if you even begin to talk about information like this, and you can get banned and de-platformed,
[2:53:34.640 --> 2:53:38.880]  and who knows what else and all. Well, let me say something about Trump. And I got this from
[2:53:38.880 --> 2:53:44.400]  people very close to Trump. I'll leave it at that. Barron was at wait a little longer to get the
[2:53:44.400 --> 2:53:49.040]  vaccines. He was about two and a half. He got the rounds. He had convulsions. He went from being
[2:53:49.040 --> 2:53:54.240]  this great smart boy to like not being able to talk. That's why Trump was like, well, this is bad.
[2:53:54.240 --> 2:54:01.840]  He said we should give less of them or study them. But that's what he comes down to is that we have
[2:54:01.840 --> 2:54:07.520]  to recognize that you cannot trust this system and what they're putting into us. And we have to say
[2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:15.440]  no. Yeah, absolutely. And that's, you know, that's what's happening as more and more people are
[2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:23.440]  waking up. But it's all hanging into balance. It is. Can you believe, though, that we're here?
[2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:27.520]  I mean, we built the infrastructure. We built the network. We're here in defiance of them.
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:32.000]  What comes next? I mean, people say, oh, how are you handling the attacks? How am I handling it?
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:36.160]  I'm connected to everybody. I'm connected to you. Not to some goody two shoes. I'm a human.
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:42.480]  It's not like I'm a hero fighting this. I'm battling for life and oxygen trapped under ice.
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:47.120]  This is not some heroic effort. It's a selfish effort. I think people need to get that. It's
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:53.440]  not like some heroic effort to fight evil. It's selfish. This takeover is anti-human, John.
[2:54:54.720 --> 2:55:02.240]  Absolutely. That's right. What do you think the whole medical program? Listen, people have their
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:08.960]  own experiences on this new film, Vax 2. It's all about people's stories, mothers, fathers, children.
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:16.240]  We had our son vaccinated, and now look what happened. It's never going to be the same again.
[2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:19.920]  Here's another story, the same thing. Another story, the same thing.
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:25.680]  Another story, the same thing. Thousands of people speaking up, and that's just the tip
[2:55:25.680 --> 2:55:33.280]  of the iceberg, believe me. These people, these doctors, many of them know what's going on.
[2:55:33.280 --> 2:55:39.280]  They have a spiritual choice to make, and most of them are making the wrong choice.
[2:55:39.280 --> 2:55:44.640]  They're unwilling to stand up and be counted. They're just like, you know,
[2:55:44.640 --> 2:55:50.960]  androids moving ahead and vaccinating more and more children. Even they know the destruction
[2:55:50.960 --> 2:55:55.120]  that is occurring, even though they understand. That's my next question. What do you make of
[2:55:55.120 --> 2:55:59.840]  the head you and scientists and all the adjuncts saying it's a cover-up? It's dangerous. We got
[2:55:59.840 --> 2:56:05.840]  to do something. In December, we cover it, you cover it. No one else covers it. How bombshell
[2:56:05.840 --> 2:56:12.480]  is the head you and scientists admitting all this? Yeah, exactly. To themselves, right?
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:17.280]  And what's their big takeaway when you looked at all those quotes from that video?
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:25.200]  The big takeaway for them is we have front-line professionals now, meaning doctors,
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:31.520]  meaning doctors that are wobbling in their support of vaccines because they don't know what to do.
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:36.080]  And this is a serious problem. And they don't believe it. They think they're bad. The doctor says,
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:39.920]  he says, the doctors think it's bad. Yeah, because they're freaking doctors.
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:47.200]  And they're waking up, you see. And from the World Health Organization point of view,
[2:56:47.200 --> 2:56:53.680]  the real problem is how do we keep our thumb down on the head of the population and our own
[2:56:53.680 --> 2:57:01.040]  doctors? So this wasn't a mea culpa. This was a desperate alert that Bill Gates isn't listening.
[2:57:01.040 --> 2:57:07.840]  And they're literally... Exactly. This was not a mea culpa by any stretch of the imagination.
[2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:15.600]  This was them sending a warning to themselves saying that Jake could be up. If we don't stop this,
[2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:21.840]  we're all going to get exposed and we're all going to go down. So you better line up with us
[2:57:21.840 --> 2:57:27.200]  because if we go down, you're going down. It's the old story. It is like Ron Brown saying,
[2:57:27.200 --> 2:57:32.320]  if Clinton tries to expose me, I'll bring them all down. Exactly. It's the same thing.
[2:57:32.320 --> 2:57:37.120]  Which shows we think we're desperate, folks. It's because we're about to go over the top.
[2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:41.040]  We're about to plant the fag at Emojima. We're going over the top.

[2:59:48.160 --> 2:59:58.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:58.160 --> 3:00:09.520]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:11.280 --> 3:00:13.600]  All right, John Rabbit, reporting on morphthicnews.com.
[3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:16.560]  This is here with us in defiance of tyranny.
[3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:22.880]  John, let's get metaphysical here in the next two segments before the next host takes over.
[3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:27.440]  What is spiritually happening? Let's go down the rabbit hole from your deep research,
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:33.200]  you're a great investigative journalist for decades, an author, a filmmaker, a great artist.
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:36.960]  I mean, you're an amazing guy. Everybody can see that. We know that.
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:42.320]  The cosmology, I'm brought up a Christian. I have spiritual experiences,
[3:00:42.320 --> 3:00:44.960]  how there's good and evil, but I'm counting in other church, whatever.
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:48.400]  But then I get higher level. The global is trying to buy me off. They try to get me in the
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:52.560]  occult. I realize it's real. At least the way they see their perspective is real,
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:00:58.000]  like this template's real. What is it though? What's happening on the planet? Who are they?
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:02.320]  What are they trying to stop us from realizing? Let's really get to the deep secrets here at
[3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:09.200]  the bottom of your soul, at the top of your focus, who you are. What is your the imprint of the
[3:01:09.200 --> 3:01:21.600]  universe in your conscious, sentient mind? What is this? Wow. I have to start off in a very simple
[3:01:21.600 --> 3:01:29.920]  way. People know what the right thing to do is. You don't have to show them or condition them.
[3:01:31.040 --> 3:01:37.600]  They know inside what's right and what's wrong. And this is not just a little petty little thing
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:42.800]  that we're talking about. You can go out as big as you want to on this into the entire universe,
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:54.800]  right? To know that when you see something that is so pathologically evil, spiritually evil,
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:02:01.760]  that is motivating and animating people to destroy other people, and you can see it,
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:12.160]  if you just stand there and you do nothing about it consciously, then you become part of them.
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:16.000]  So consciousness is right action. It's choosing God or destruction?
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:23.680]  Yeah, it's choosing just in my own language, the right thing, the spiritually right thing to do.
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:28.560]  There is no getting away from the spiritual issue. Consciousness is will.
[3:02:30.240 --> 3:02:37.920]  Consciousness is not material. It's not like saying, well, because I've got this
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:43.440]  money that I have to have. I've got a big mansion, a castle. I killed a million people,
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:50.000]  but it's okay. Everyone says I'm powerful. Right. And then if somebody comes along and says, well,
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:57.760]  we can take that away from you unless you keep doing evil things or stand by and let us do them.
[3:02:57.760 --> 3:03:02.880]  And then the guy with the mansion says, hey, do anything you want to. I mean, look at it on a
[3:03:02.880 --> 3:03:08.320]  small scale. It's cosmologically speaking. Look at Hollywood. Look how many cowards there are in
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:13.920]  Hollywood who would appear on the screen to be the greatest superheroes in the world and so on.
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:18.160]  But then you approach them on an issue and you say, well, what do you think about this?
[3:03:18.160 --> 3:03:23.280]  Don't you realize that's evil? Yeah, but I roll over instantly. I can't say it. Well,
[3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:27.840]  why can't you say anything about it? Because then I'm going to lose my position. I'll never get
[3:03:27.840 --> 3:03:34.000]  working this town again. Yeah. So, so what? So how do you live with yourself in the meantime?
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:39.840]  And of course, they have no answer for that. But the answer is drugs, lowering their own
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:46.000]  consciousness, pretending there's somebody else, making up all kinds of excuses and so on. Becoming
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:52.800]  robots. Becoming robots and hanging out with other people who are robots. And then when you get
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:58.880]  that multiplied out enough times, you have, for example, I don't know, a million people
[3:04:00.320 --> 3:04:04.880]  in the country or in the territory. And then they expand the circle.
[3:04:05.680 --> 3:04:11.680]  They expand the circle. It just keeps on going. We're all together because I'm looking at you
[3:04:11.680 --> 3:04:16.640]  and you're looking at me and we both know that we're complicit. We both know that that's a cult.
[3:04:16.640 --> 3:04:23.120]  That's a cult. It could be gigantic. It could be a hundred million people and so on. So,
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:29.760]  you know, it could be more or it could be five people, but it's the same principle.
[3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:35.360]  We've now reached, I'm not just saying to stay there, John. We've reached the high plateau here.
[3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:39.280]  This is what it's all about. You're going to serve somebody like Bob Dylan said.
[3:04:40.160 --> 3:04:44.880]  Really? Who are you going to serve, folks? Who are you going to serve? What cult are you going to
[3:04:44.880 --> 3:04:50.960]  join? You're going to join a cult. Be advised that there are cults to join or you can join.
[3:04:53.040 --> 3:04:56.720]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[3:06:08.560 --> 3:06:16.640]  All right, John Rabaport is our guest. And Dr. Nick Baggage is one of the great patriots.
[3:06:16.640 --> 3:06:19.520]  I'm the great minds about the takeover, about where we are as crossroads.
[3:06:26.480 --> 3:06:30.400]  The other people like Dr. Baggage, who's super smart, smarter than I am,
[3:06:30.960 --> 3:06:36.800]  and he already knows the end game, and he's so confident that he's zinned out. And I could do
[3:06:36.800 --> 3:06:43.360]  that too. I have made the decision, like nuclear fuel rods shoved in, that I'm going to feel the
[3:06:43.360 --> 3:06:47.840]  whole deal. And that's what I'm doing. And I appreciate the listeners and viewers keeping
[3:06:47.840 --> 3:06:52.240]  up this position. John Rabaport's here. We're talking about the nature of evil, the nature of
[3:06:52.240 --> 3:06:57.520]  the world, the nature of where all this is going. They're not even talking about atheism now.
[3:06:57.520 --> 3:07:03.040]  They're not even talking about all that. They're just racing past saying computers are God, get rid
[3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:14.160]  of humans. And you're seeing so many people fall away from reality and the spirit, but so many
[3:07:14.160 --> 3:07:20.960]  coming towards it. What is this collision? What is this event? What is this time we're in, John
[3:07:20.960 --> 3:07:27.280]  Rabaport? Well, I think that collision is exactly what you're talking about. It's a collision between
[3:07:27.280 --> 3:07:35.920]  the spirit and matter between the people that are materialists. What can I gain? What advantage
[3:07:35.920 --> 3:07:41.360]  can I have? How can I get ahead? And that's all there is. There isn't anything else. That's all
[3:07:41.360 --> 3:07:48.320]  there is. And that kind of thing. And these are people who turn into robots and people who make
[3:07:48.320 --> 3:07:56.160]  robots that turn into robots, you know, mechanical, made of flesh, whatever. And then there are people
[3:07:56.160 --> 3:08:05.520]  who see that they have some kind of a spiritual choice to make and a journey to go on that involves
[3:08:06.400 --> 3:08:11.600]  doing what they know is the right thing. This is what happens when people tune into you.
[3:08:12.320 --> 3:08:16.400]  Regardless of what you're talking about, regardless of what position you're taking on,
[3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:24.000]  what issue and whatever and whatever, you push people to figure out, without even trying,
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:31.360]  what is the right thing to do? You know, this is what people are hungry for. Someone who is saying
[3:08:31.360 --> 3:08:36.560]  to them, you have to find out what the right thing to do is in your soul. Because the Satan
[3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:42.400]  doesn't even want people to know there's a decision. Right. There is no decision. There's only joining
[3:08:42.400 --> 3:08:47.440]  up in the big cult. Oh, that's what the globalists in front of my crew, Rothkopf, they said there's
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:53.200]  not even a choice. Oh, money, power, why wouldn't you? Because my soul recoils from it. And then the
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:08:57.920]  poison that comes out the end of what will make it power, there's not good stuff coming out of it,
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:09:03.920]  John. No, no. And that's just the beginning, what you're talking about. That's sort of like
[3:09:03.920 --> 3:09:10.480]  opening the door. Look, you can join the club, you can come in. And then you have all these advantages
[3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:15.760]  given to you if you do, you know, and then you say, Oh, that sounds good. Okay, let's try that.
[3:09:15.760 --> 3:09:22.800]  And then what happens to you actually is you give up your spirit step by step,
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:28.880]  which is all that matters. Which is all that matters exactly. And then you start doing evil
[3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:34.240]  things. And then you say, Well, I want to turn around and go back. And then the fellow cult
[3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:39.920]  members say no, no, you can't turn around. It's too late. You cross the threshold. That's what
[3:09:39.920 --> 3:09:45.520]  it means when you join up. You cross the threshold. You're now in this with all of us. We're all
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:49.760]  doing this. And you say, Well, I didn't know that when I came in, it was going to involve doing
[3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:54.800]  evil and letting other people just do evil. And they said, Well, we don't call it evil. It's
[3:09:54.800 --> 3:10:00.480]  actually good. And we can explain why if you want to, but you can't turn around. You're now
[3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:07.360]  joined to the hip with all of us. That's right. And that is what happens to these people. And then
[3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:14.880]  we look at these arch evil people and we see them for what they are. They are committed now. They
[3:10:14.880 --> 3:10:21.520]  have to be committed to doing evil, not just on a material level now, but on a spiritual level,
[3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:29.040]  because they've gone so far, they don't see how they can turn back. You can turn back,
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:36.800]  but you have to make a stand. You have to say, No, that's it. Uh-oh. Well, where it leads is
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:41.520]  absolute defilement. When in my experience being good and virtuous and loving,
[3:10:41.520 --> 3:10:49.360]  like material things are just tools to be free becomes a joke. Like worshiping a can of soda or
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:56.000]  a or a or a it's everything is a theory. Everything is thought. Everything is what you stand for.
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:11:01.760]  Everything is being good. And they don't even know that. So they wage war against what's honorable,
[3:11:01.760 --> 3:11:06.160]  the man, the woman, the family, the archetype, the program, the original code.
[3:11:06.160 --> 3:11:16.400]  Exactly. Exactly what happens. The operation is to get people to forget that they have a choice,
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:22.720]  that they know what's right, that they can do what's right, that they have a spirit, and that
[3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:28.720]  that is far more important than any momentary. Let's explain this because this is a secret to
[3:11:28.720 --> 3:11:35.200]  it all in my view. The devil, the system tells you, you could be powerful. You could be amazing.
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:40.080]  You could have all these dreams. It puts a mirror in front of your face that interdimensionally looks
[3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:45.040]  back through your entire potential and forward. It shows you your soul and says, I will give you
[3:11:45.040 --> 3:11:52.160]  your soul if you follow me. When that great vision is giving you is the potential you already have,
[3:11:52.160 --> 3:11:58.640]  that if you give it to Satan, you lose. You're already made in the image of God. You're already
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:05.120]  divine in God's will. You already have all this potential, and it's tricking you to give it power
[3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:12.640]  to control you because you believe that it's given you that vision and that power when God
[3:12:12.640 --> 3:12:17.520]  made you that way. Didn't give it to you. It made you. You're free will. You're made.
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:24.000]  Like you're there. You're a made man. You're a made woman, and they're trying to steal that power,
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:28.400]  and that's the most frustrating thing is watching people sign away their birthright.
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:34.320]  And everything got to these these midget gremlins that are older than us, and they're there
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:40.560]  in placing themselves in front of our vision. Exactly. They want to sell you back to you.
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:45.920]  Nothing could be more insane or ridiculous. Say that again, because the way you just pull it down,
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:53.200]  the way they sell you back to you back to you, just like that's what you were saying, in essence.
[3:12:53.200 --> 3:12:59.200]  You see, you don't already have it. We have it, and we can give it to you, and then you have it.
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:05.200]  And you're saying, well, you already have it. That's right. So their trick is to convince you
[3:13:05.200 --> 3:13:11.200]  that you don't have spirit, power, knowledge of the right thing to do, and a great vision of what
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:17.200]  you can do in this world and other worlds. No, you don't have that. They're saying, but we can sell
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:25.200]  it to you. We can give it to you. And if you're tricked, then you buy it. Whereas it's already
[3:13:25.200 --> 3:13:31.200]  there. You already have it. It's already you. That's what you are. There's no way to get out of that.
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:37.200]  If you recognize it, that's what you've already got. So how do we spread that to others?
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:43.200]  Well, by one, we keep saying it saying it over and over again, in different ways to wake people up
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:49.200]  to that fact. I'm sure that this conversation is waking up more than a few people who are
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:57.200]  getting. No, I agree. But God is free will. So how do you open yourself up to God, but not to bad stuff
[3:13:57.200 --> 3:14:02.200]  and just say, because if people open yourself to God, you, I can instantly just like connect to it.
[3:14:02.200 --> 3:14:07.200]  I'm going to be arrogant here on air and do it. But the point is, I can instantly just be in that place
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:13.200]  the most time that David talks about in the Psalms. How do people begin that journey? I guess not going
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:19.200]  to a fake church that knows they're seeking God and sucks him in. How do you do that?
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:29.200]  I think you recognize that you're you. You're an individual. You're not existing by virtue of the fact
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:37.200]  that you're hooked up to other things and people and so forth. That's not the source of your exactly.
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:45.200]  You don't need Facebook, Goldman Sachs. You need you need you. If you start there, you're going to go on
[3:14:45.200 --> 3:14:52.200]  the path. There's nothing that's going to stop because that's where it leads. It's only when you just like
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:59.200]  you said it's only when you start saying, no, I'm actually, you know, I'm Petsicola. I'm Coca Cola. I'm the little
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:06.200]  the house on the car on the this on these other people that are robots. And we're all that's the source
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:15.200]  of my existence. You know, then you then you're gone and you're but if you know that you're you just you
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:23.200]  as you are, then you can't not go on. Well, that's it. I mean, they thought they take things away from me and
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:28.200]  those are nothing. John Rapport, you got to come on more than once every six months. Please come back on
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:33.200]  next week. We love you. No more fake news.com. You're a beautiful soul. We love you, John. We love John Rapport.
[3:15:33.200 --> 3:15:39.200]  Thank you so much. Thank you, Alex. Thank you so much. It's such a quickening now. We're coming closer to God.
[3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:45.200]  Those that are with God are falling to the devil right now. Such a beautiful time, but also a painful time. Best of
[3:15:45.200 --> 3:16:10.200]  times. Worst of times. Got a big bag just takes over.

[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:13.760]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in

[3:17:48.640 --> 3:17:56.960]  security which requires an offering document. I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars of

[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:12.480]  changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres. But something I
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:19.040]  should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing. You've
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:22.800]  got that pledge from me but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration,
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:27.840]  the water filtration. The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:34.960]  you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's not
[3:18:34.960 --> 3:18:43.040]  a burden to support info wars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for
[3:18:43.040 --> 3:18:47.680]  justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life

[3:18:57.200 --> 3:19:03.120]  around the office especially folks that have worked there a long time have noticed that I really
[3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:08.240]  don't ever get sick. Now again I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement
[3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:13.040]  I'm not tempting fate. I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[3:19:13.040 --> 3:19:18.800]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the constitution I've been given but up until about
[3:19:18.800 --> 3:19:25.520]  eight nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products in Forrest Life I still got sick
[3:19:25.520 --> 3:19:30.480]  every couple years and you know I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like
[3:19:30.480 --> 3:19:37.920]  that but now that I religiously take the products at info wars life with the highest quality supplements
[3:19:37.920 --> 3:19:46.240]  you're going to find out there I just never get a fever anymore. It's probably been three four years
[3:19:46.240 --> 3:19:51.680]  since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[3:19:51.680 --> 3:20:07.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:07.600 --> 3:20:24.080]  All right Dr. Nick Baggett scientist filmmaker author is taking over right now but I want to
[3:20:24.080 --> 3:20:28.880]  tell you something real quick here while they're trying to impeach the president
[3:20:29.600 --> 3:20:34.320]  all hell's breaking loose around the world they're launching this simulant bio weapon obviously
[3:20:34.320 --> 3:20:40.480]  but you heard about Mike Adams and thousands of other sites not hundreds being taken down by
[3:20:40.480 --> 3:20:44.960]  bizarre illegal secret court orders that we're finding out are totally fraudulent now why is
[3:20:44.960 --> 3:20:50.320]  that so important it's not about Mike Adams getting natural news blocked it's only up on
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:56.320]  a backup server. Michael tell you that if they shot me in the street today that means they're
[3:20:56.320 --> 3:21:02.080]  going for broke it's a canary in the coal mine show the fact that all this hell's breaking loose
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:07.280]  shows they're going for broke so I haven't made a big deal about this but let me just do an overhead
[3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:13.040]  shop for TV viewers please we have some of the biggest servers in the world on a system called
[3:21:13.040 --> 3:21:19.200]  cloud flare and listeners have been asking the last few days why does it say checking your browser
[3:21:20.240 --> 3:21:25.440]  oh my kid's calling me checking your browser before because we've got to put this big service in
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:31.680]  front of it that's the highest level of defense because there's the Nala service attacks and
[3:21:31.680 --> 3:21:38.400]  other attacks happening that are 20 times any previous attack that's the number but it's not
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:45.920]  just us it's everybody so while the trial this president's going on and while this bio systems
[3:21:45.920 --> 3:21:52.560]  whirling out and while all this is happening this is going on not just us but basically anybody
[3:21:52.560 --> 3:21:57.040]  that's pro-human not about liberal not about conservative now it's about pro-human future
[3:21:57.040 --> 3:22:05.840]  anti-human future love versus hate and as dr. nick baggins always says we shouldn't give into hate
[3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:10.000]  we shouldn't give into fear we should give into love and not be afraid because that's how they
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:14.720]  try to control us but oh and shroyer got arrested we're just putting a piece of tape over his
[3:22:14.720 --> 3:22:19.520]  mouth they hit the Capitol other people could protest the judge dropped it so there's some good
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:23.760]  in the universe as well it's just it he'll be on the war room I'm told he's getting out of jail
[3:22:23.760 --> 3:22:28.800]  right now coming up here in about 40 minutes war room oh and shroyer so please tell folks about that
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:35.040]  but this is the world we're in this is what's happening this is the crossroads and a lot of
[3:22:35.040 --> 3:22:38.400]  good things are happening a lot of bad things are happening but I just wanted to let folks know that
[3:22:40.480 --> 3:22:44.480]  we set up our own audio and video streaming we set up our own servers and we spent a lot of
[3:22:44.480 --> 3:22:49.120]  money doing it and it's you when it when you see us still standing in the face of this
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:55.920]  when everybody else is going down that's you you stood up to the fight you stood up to the attack
[3:22:55.920 --> 3:23:01.040]  again that isn't fanciful words to make you feel important when you buy products at infowarestore.com
[3:23:01.040 --> 3:23:05.360]  you are important you're getting great products are good for you and your family books films
[3:23:05.360 --> 3:23:10.800]  supplements water filtration anything I sell is because I know it's good for you why wouldn't I
[3:23:10.800 --> 3:23:15.520]  sell something that was good metaphysically I want to do it I want you to get a response I want you
[3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:21.440]  to order it again let's see evil isn't like that it disrespects you because it disrespects humanity
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:27.920]  because it's anti-human I'm human I respect you because I respect myself I'm an individual is 100
[3:23:27.920 --> 3:23:33.200]  percent but I understand my individualism is manifests as collectivism not of some communist
[3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:40.560]  globalist archetype that's a counterfeit but as true collectivism of us as the crowd believing
[3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:47.120]  in what we want as a culture and it always being right I'm in love with humanity I'm not a narcissist
[3:23:47.120 --> 3:23:53.760]  I'm a humanist and not in the leftist term the modern humanist is the anti-humanist the people
[3:23:53.760 --> 3:23:59.040]  that claim they control humanity know I want to set humanity free because his potential is limitless
[3:23:59.040 --> 3:24:03.920]  and the pioneer of this is Dr. Nick baggage Dr. Nick baggage take over and God bless you my friend
[3:24:03.920 --> 3:24:10.640]  hey thank you Alex it's it's always my pleasure to be with you you know and when we think about
[3:24:10.640 --> 3:24:15.280]  all of this happening in the world right now I mean we've got impeachment hearings we've got
[3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:24.240]  the virus breaking out in Asia we have people moving across the lower portion of the Mexican
[3:24:24.240 --> 3:24:31.200]  border I mean it's like we have the Middle East exploding in all different fractional
[3:24:31.200 --> 3:24:39.120]  breakups that are 20 20 is it disappointing no it's like Armageddon right now at the beginning
[3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:45.920]  of it at least in my perspective you know you think about sort of what's happening and going back
[3:24:45.920 --> 3:24:50.800]  to when you and I first started working together I was thinking about that a little bit today and
[3:24:50.800 --> 3:24:56.560]  as I was listening to John and you ending up the last segments you know the whole conflict
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:25:03.360]  between the material and the spiritual or the you know or the non-material and when I think about
[3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:09.360]  you know sort of what's happened with the internet with speech with everything you know the idea is
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:17.280]  track not just you and me individually but everything you know where everything is and
[3:25:17.280 --> 3:25:22.000]  where you are at every moment you know and I go back to the writing and the stuff we were doing
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:28.640]  we were doing now 20 years ago and we were talking about this then you know looking back at the
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:33.440]  book earth rising you're the only place left on the planet you can get hard copies of it the
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:40.000]  book earth rising had a whole section on the end of privacy which is really where we are today in
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:48.560]  the in the in this beginning of this next decade and clearly predictable not from some esoteric
[3:25:48.560 --> 3:25:53.040]  perspective but absolutely from the facts and what the science showed and what was in the open
[3:25:53.040 --> 3:26:02.320]  literature and earth rising had 650 sources in it documenting sort of where this was all headed
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:09.760]  and it dealt with biometrics facial recognition all of the systems you hear about today and this
[3:26:09.760 --> 3:26:16.960]  was just before 9 11 when the real prank down happened and this is something else that we
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:23.280]  talked about before 9 11 that they would look for this opportunity to screw down personal
[3:26:23.280 --> 3:26:28.800]  privacy and liberty and do it on the backbone of international terrorism and drug trafficking and
[3:26:28.800 --> 3:26:36.000]  we predicted that in 2000 in the book earth rising the revolution and then right after 9 11 we came
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:43.120]  out with earth rising too and that and that also is only available through the info war store now
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:49.120]  in hard copy and you know that that book sort of took at the next step and we had a whole section
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:56.000]  again on privacy you know just looking back on it what did we talk about we talked about id systems
[3:26:56.640 --> 3:27:04.960]  for human tracing we talked about tracking through gps your mileage and your distance and your
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:11.040]  location everywhere you go everywhere you stop everyone else who's next to you and now we have
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:17.840]  really what has become what we talked about then is data valence and we talked and spoke in the
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:26.080]  european parliament about data valence in 1998 99 and by then they had already taken this issue up
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:33.280]  and then the early part of the century began moving in a direction to really make sure we weren't
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:39.520]  screwed down too awfully tight in this area in fact it's the one place where they say you can still
[3:27:39.520 --> 3:27:46.400]  opt out i doubt that really but the point of the matter is what was supposed to liberate has in fact
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:53.600]  captured and imprisoned through the digital gulag if you will because when you think about
[3:27:53.600 --> 3:27:59.920]  information warfare which is really going back again to earth rising there's a section called
[3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:05.520]  information war right and it's a multi-dimensional war it's not just about hacking into people's
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:11.760]  computers and stealing their data which is what a lot of the media points to it's the media itself
[3:28:13.040 --> 3:28:22.480]  as a weapon in the propaganda wars of the 21st century and now where we're at is exactly in
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:29.120]  that place you know we're headed into the info wars because we're in the midst of a war the war
[3:28:29.120 --> 3:28:35.120]  for your mind the war for the future the world war for the next generation and it's you and I who

[3:33:08.160 --> 3:33:18.080]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host nick
[3:33:18.080 --> 3:33:29.120]  baggage and welcome back i'm pleased to be here today sitting in this last hour of the alex jones
[3:33:29.120 --> 3:33:34.960]  show you know talking about um sort of where the where things left off in the last hour and kind
[3:33:34.960 --> 3:33:40.560]  of picking that up which is kind which is really where i wanted to go today is talk about contrast
[3:33:40.560 --> 3:33:49.280]  between really consciousness and the human spirit against materialism and the surveillance system
[3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:56.320]  and how they really worked to separate us and to sort of parse us out in a way that's not only
[3:33:56.880 --> 3:34:03.440]  counterproductive but is counter human counter creation i think what alex was trying to say in
[3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:12.000]  that last um bit you know this idea that uh the dehumanizing the reducing us to consumer or taxpayer
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:20.240]  or some other label label uh left right pink green whatever you know the story is um is designed to
[3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:27.760]  divide uh what is in fact we are indeed individuals as john raptor was saying in the last uh hour as
[3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:34.800]  well and that's the power um that we come from is that individual power point of individual choices
[3:34:34.800 --> 3:34:40.880]  that we get to make in the context of our relationships with others that we're also connected
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:50.160]  to in a very deep way um as cells in one body if you will connect it and i believe that um absolutely
[3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:58.160]  so think about social media uh even the phrase because every phrase that's new is not something
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:04.960]  that's just uh pops out of the ether in most cases it actually is structured and designed
[3:35:05.600 --> 3:35:13.760]  to frame a thought to convey an idea that may in fact mask the truth social media is in fact
[3:35:13.760 --> 3:35:22.240]  one of those phrases that masked the truth what it should be called is um social surveillance okay
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:32.640]  not media social surveillance because it's more about extracting the data um uh from us google
[3:35:32.640 --> 3:35:42.960]  and facebook being the evil twins um the brothers in arms uh of the global system of capturing your
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:51.040]  data and when you overlay on that um the other systems that now exist uh you put a microphone
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:58.320]  in your home uh with computers with cell phones with these devices devices uh as they're called
[3:35:58.320 --> 3:36:05.600]  another phrase um to kind of limit the view of what they are i mean what are they after all
[3:36:05.600 --> 3:36:13.760]  their surveillance equipment that masquerades as telephones and pcs how about that um or
[3:36:13.760 --> 3:36:18.320]  they're both uh let's say that i think that's fair enough okay and there are a lot more than that
[3:36:18.320 --> 3:36:23.600]  as well and all these and automobiles with all the electronics built in something we talked about
[3:36:23.600 --> 3:36:28.960]  again in 2000 was that all that electronics would eventually track everywhere you went
[3:36:28.960 --> 3:36:35.360]  at every place you stopped and everyone in close proximity to you and then you get a real
[3:36:36.560 --> 3:36:44.960]  view of of who you are that's bigger than anything ever contemplated or imagined in history
[3:36:45.600 --> 3:36:50.160]  and we're there right now okay we were talking about where we were headed
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:59.440]  20 25 years ago now but we're here now 25 years later we've arrived in the moment
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:05.920]  and we're all here together in this moment making individual choices in this moment
[3:37:06.640 --> 3:37:12.960]  about what we're going to do and we can't do it in fear and anxiety although the world
[3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:18.000]  you look at the world coming at us in the way it is generates a fair amount of that
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:25.360]  um and think about this in the uh um biblical sense if you will the first thing out of an angel's
[3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:30.400]  mouth was always fear not you know and there was a reason for that because as soon as you
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:36.480]  start experiencing fear and anxiety your mental capacity shuts down your connection to the spiritual
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:43.120]  shuts off and you fall into a reptilian brain a materialistic brain the brain of the flesh
[3:37:43.120 --> 3:37:49.520]  uh if you will and that's what then pushes out into uh destructive creation the world this
[3:37:49.520 --> 3:37:58.240]  materialism that we fall into um and social media uh is in fact um a lie uh it is social
[3:37:58.240 --> 3:38:04.960]  manipulation um it strips you of your time and your true relationships and guts you of your
[3:38:04.960 --> 3:38:11.280]  opportunity to make a difference in the world um this is what social media has done and and
[3:38:11.280 --> 3:38:17.760]  I turned it on for a couple weeks uh in the course of doing a campaign here in Alaska just to see
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:22.720]  you know if you could do something with it and I can tell you I'm I turned it off and then made
[3:38:22.720 --> 3:38:28.640]  sure it was off uh indefinitely and if you signed up for something don't take offense I just shut
[3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:35.120]  it off I wanted the experience of it so I could speak more about it and within days I was getting
[3:38:35.120 --> 3:38:41.120]  a couple hundred inquiries and just an overwhelming amount of conversations that there is no way to
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:48.480]  deal with nor would I want to and and I thought you know people are that distracted how could you
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:54.080]  ever have a conversation with anyone face to face and then I read some of the more recent
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:39:00.320]  journal articles about so-called social media and its effect on the next generation who were
[3:39:00.320 --> 3:39:08.000]  incapable of relationship in fact uh for a couple of college classes I read where they had had the
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:14.480]  entire class shut them off you know but actually only 12 would do it you know out of 30 for a couple
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:21.840]  weeks and what they found was exactly that that they um that the whole uh outcome the whole framework
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:27.840]  became different the way they dealt with each other became different um their level of empathy
[3:39:27.840 --> 3:39:32.720]  increased and compassion a lot of things changed because they've been dealing with each other as
[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:37.600]  little blips on the screen as opposed to personal relationship looking each other in the eye even
[3:39:37.600 --> 3:39:42.000]  doing that became a bit of a challenge in the first few days because people weren't used to
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:49.520]  looking at each other in the eye uh think about that for just a moment and and then let's talk about
[3:39:50.480 --> 3:39:57.200]  the propaganda side of this and how that works and and and how the effect of getting a population
[3:39:57.200 --> 3:40:05.600]  do something that just seems like so ridiculously out so crazy how do you get a educated smart
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:11.760]  mass of people do something so out of this world you know like what happened in Germany in the late
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:19.520]  1930s well let me tell you the first step in that is to get you to disconnect from the truth to get
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:27.360]  you to first shut up and then begin repeating something that you yourself know is untrue
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:34.400]  and when you do that this is uh in the modern term not the 1930s term this is called political
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:42.560]  correctness by withholding your truth and and then not speaking it and then at some point perhaps
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:47.600]  even because you feel the social pressure to actually say what you don't believe it we're
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:52.800]  certainly not opposed it when it's in your face but this is a dangerous place to be because what
[3:40:52.800 --> 3:40:57.840]  happens then is the consciousness the part of you that tells you right and wrong good and evil
[3:40:57.840 --> 3:41:06.640]  begins to shut down and then you begin to declare more political correct speech and embrace more
[3:41:07.200 --> 3:41:13.200]  on silence and more tolerance which is a form of self-hatred and if you think back on what
[3:41:13.200 --> 3:41:17.920]  John and Alex were saying in the last hour about the individual this is not a very good
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:22.800]  place to be and if you believe that you're creating the image and likeness of God then
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:29.760]  self-condemnation at that level is maybe blasphemous even you know I mean maybe it's really the wrong
[3:41:29.760 --> 3:41:35.120]  way to approach it certainly recognition of your weaknesses and how to improve as a part of our
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:42.960]  game plan on earth but driving ourselves into the dirt as the highest creation is not really I think
[3:41:42.960 --> 3:41:48.240]  proper outcome nor is it how we should treat one another in the dialogue and what a lot of social
[3:41:48.240 --> 3:41:55.520]  media does is allow us a higher level of general disrespect and then provides information to
[3:41:56.160 --> 3:42:03.760]  agencies of major corporations globalists governments and others to manipulate us in mass
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:08.800]  and that's what's been happening in the info wars when you think about cambridge analytical which
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:14.400]  I'm going to get to a little bit in the next segment 68 countries were manipulated their
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:21.440]  elections manipulate is what they're saying by cambridge analytical and here's what we know about
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:28.800]  big data and we've said it forever once you have the data you have a profile of people that's so
[3:42:28.800 --> 3:42:34.640]  refined so perfect it's almost metaphysical what they can predict about you and the information
[3:42:34.640 --> 3:42:40.640]  can be fed back in and the more you're in that system the less individual liberty and freedom
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:49.360]  that you have this is where we are in the the beginning of 2020 we need 2020 vision a new vision
[3:42:49.360 --> 3:42:56.800]  for this next century it is I the leader of cobra here for a message to president trump
[3:42:56.800 --> 3:43:04.240]  the american people and alex jones of info wars our operations with our partners the communist
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:12.080]  chinese have bought control of your media but it's true your people are beginning to awaken
[3:43:12.640 --> 3:43:19.840]  that's why cobra is launching operations to trigger race war mass shootings and bombings
[3:43:19.840 --> 3:43:26.800]  which will be blamed on those loyal to america anyone wants to be staged these attacks that
[3:43:26.800 --> 3:43:36.560]  does not blame it on trump will also be targeted by cobra in the future you see when you expose our
[3:43:36.560 --> 3:43:45.360]  false flags and fake media i will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with alex jones
[3:43:45.360 --> 3:43:53.360]  blaming him for mass shootings we committed hey oh cobra info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough
[3:43:53.360 --> 3:43:59.600]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[3:43:59.600 --> 3:44:05.520]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:12.640]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate
[3:44:12.640 --> 3:44:18.320]  certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:23.680]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research
[3:44:23.680 --> 3:44:30.320]  a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural
[3:44:30.320 --> 3:44:35.920]  and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts
[3:44:35.920 --> 3:44:41.360]  by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[3:44:41.360 --> 3:44:47.680]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to info wars life dot com
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:54.320]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets there's a lot of phony garbage out there
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:45:00.640]  in the world a lot of people that never deliver well i'm here to tell you info wars has delivered
[3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:08.720]  in royal flush in a handful of ace of spades because of god because of the audience of activists
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:15.120]  and because of the great team at info wars and we are all a team ladies and gentlemen so right now
[3:45:15.120 --> 3:45:19.840]  humanity is awakening it's explosive it's powerful it's incredible but there's major
[3:45:19.840 --> 3:45:25.040]  obstacles coming down the road and the only way we can effectively fight the nwo and stay in the
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:29.760]  game like info wars is the tip of the spear is your financial support we make it really easy
[3:45:29.760 --> 3:45:36.240]  at info warshore dot com but i am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:40.800]  doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it and oan and the rest of the
[3:45:40.800 --> 3:45:46.000]  crew will fight 18 hours a day seven days a week during this election year that's so critical but
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:51.280]  they need the financing to put them in the field go to info warshore dot com and fight for your own
[3:45:51.280 --> 3:45:57.920]  future info warshore dot com we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're
[3:45:57.920 --> 3:46:01.600]  going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them i want to thank the listeners for
[3:46:01.600 --> 3:46:08.320]  getting it but this really is a game changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue
[3:46:08.320 --> 3:46:13.440]  that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free the adult or the children's
[3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:18.400]  these are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers people love it this is a
[3:46:18.400 --> 3:46:24.400]  whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also
[3:46:24.400 --> 3:46:31.280]  remineralizes the teeth then it has the patented silver salt silver in it to knock out the bacteria
[3:46:31.280 --> 3:46:36.080]  that cause ginsivitis this is all proven you can make claims with this but i had to tell you no one
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:42.480]  has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses and cleaning the teeth in
[3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:48.240]  a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really proud of it it funds the operation
[3:46:48.240 --> 3:46:51.600]  info warshore dot com that's why we're still on air thanks to you
[3:46:51.600 --> 3:47:03.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:20.720]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's nick baggage you're listening to the alex
[3:47:20.720 --> 3:47:31.920]  jones show welcome back it's good to be with you this uh friday afternoon uh most of the world and
[3:47:32.560 --> 3:47:37.280]  headed towards uh noon in my part of the world next couple weeks i'm going to be gone i'm going
[3:47:37.280 --> 3:47:42.080]  to be traveling uh actually to asia which is maybe the wrong place to be going right now but
[3:47:42.800 --> 3:47:49.600]  that's where i'm going to be i'll be back um after the uh uh 8th of february and um i'm looking
[3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:56.400]  forward to being back uh you know when i think about uh this whole data valence issue and how
[3:47:56.400 --> 3:48:02.320]  it's evolved and what's happened over the last 25 years um you know cambridge analytica got a lot
[3:48:02.320 --> 3:48:09.280]  of notoriety and and then they spun off into a new company and uh and you'll see a lot of each
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:14.160]  you know it's not the only one i mean they you know google hasn't gotten the nearly the attention
[3:48:14.160 --> 3:48:19.760]  they should on this issue because they're the monster of all uh and facebook of course is their
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:27.360]  handmade and you know the data that was gathered by cambridge analytica essentially came from these
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:32.400]  and others that make it readily available to commercial and governmental interests and this
[3:48:32.400 --> 3:48:39.520]  is that the situation is it's your data it's your information and this is part of the new revolution
[3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:45.440]  the digital revolution that also needs to take place right now and it's to recapture control of
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:51.680]  our individual identity in terms of how it expresses itself in the world and we should not
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:57.760]  be subject to this level of surveillance um it should not be allowed um on any level and i've
[3:48:57.760 --> 3:49:03.600]  said this before it's not only should be forbidden but the corporation are engaged and if they're
[3:49:03.600 --> 3:49:10.720]  boards of directors and their officers ought to be held legally accountable um and criminally
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:16.640]  accountable so that if there's criminal convictions for human rights violations they go to prison
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:22.720]  so if you want to serve on these boards or be those officers and you are extra vigilant
[3:49:22.720 --> 3:49:28.480]  rather than not vigilant at all and doing just the opposite taking all that data and selling it
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:36.960]  or using it and making it available in a way that essentially robs us of our privacy which is the
[3:49:36.960 --> 3:49:44.480]  gateway to manipulation of every single social and political and cultural outcome and this is what
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:52.960]  media has become is the vehicle through which you can foster a very narrow set of beliefs
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:58.800]  that you can then hold and come and across the worldwide population and now they're shutting
[3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:06.080]  down free speech they're shutting down the ability to hear these messages and others um on a wholesale
[3:50:06.080 --> 3:50:15.280]  basis and using the danger of information terrorism as uh the excuse and this is the danger if there
[3:50:15.280 --> 3:50:25.600]  ever was one is words you know uh sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me
[3:50:25.600 --> 3:50:29.840]  you know we used to say that when we were a little kids i don't even know if they say that anymore
[3:50:29.840 --> 3:50:36.320]  um but that was a statement about the freedom of speech that was sort of embedded in us as children
[3:50:37.280 --> 3:50:44.880]  sticks and stones will break our bones but words will never hurt me words are meant to uh entice
[3:50:44.880 --> 3:50:52.640]  to excite to engender to generate emotion that's what words do whether we like it or not and if
[3:50:52.640 --> 3:51:00.560]  you're too much of a cupcake snowflake or flake to take it well change the channel i mean it's
[3:51:00.560 --> 3:51:08.960]  as simple as that in the 21st century you know it's yeah you can say things and how you say things
[3:51:08.960 --> 3:51:17.120]  does matter no doubt but i can tell you i can tell you this that you have the right to change the
[3:51:17.120 --> 3:51:25.600]  channel in certain uses of language that violate certain thresholds you know um you know it's called
[3:51:25.600 --> 3:51:30.960]  liable and slander you got to write a recourse if you're a public figure you don't you know unless
[3:51:30.960 --> 3:51:36.560]  someone is maliciously trying to defame you which is a very high legal standard almost impossible
[3:51:36.560 --> 3:51:44.320]  to prove um so free speech is important to protect as a fundamental social media if we're
[3:51:44.320 --> 3:51:50.320]  going to have it it needs to be restricted in this sense the data collection needs to end and it's
[3:51:50.320 --> 3:51:56.400]  not a case of you opting out or opting in where you go oh i sign the agreement it's all good they
[3:51:56.400 --> 3:52:04.400]  can take my data and use it no what i'm proposing is that as a matter of law that they're not allowed
[3:52:04.400 --> 3:52:12.320]  to ask you to opt in or out and you're not allowed to agree or disagree it's just not an option
[3:52:13.120 --> 3:52:20.160]  no one has the right to ask you to give up your liberty that's the option no one has a right to
[3:52:20.160 --> 3:52:27.920]  ask you to give up your liberty your privacy your individuality or any aspect of who you are
[3:52:27.920 --> 3:52:34.560]  unless it truly tramples um over the right of someone else in a way that's clear and absolute
[3:52:34.560 --> 3:52:45.200]  and not by words or by religion or by gathering together in assembly or by any of the fundamentals
[3:52:45.200 --> 3:52:51.840]  that make us free people uh what we consider the foundations of our democracy in this republic
[3:52:51.840 --> 3:52:59.520]  the idea that we the people individually and then collectively as selves in one body
[3:52:59.520 --> 3:53:05.920]  determining outcomes of our government and our society and our cultures and that's being taken
[3:53:05.920 --> 3:53:14.080]  away and media used as the vehicle the gateway into your digital doorway as every one of our homes
[3:53:14.080 --> 3:53:25.200]  has been kicked in uh consistently for the last 25 years 25 years okay if you were 15 years old
[3:53:25.200 --> 3:53:31.040]  when alex and i started talking about some of this and we're paying attention you know you're 40 now
[3:53:32.400 --> 3:53:38.000]  you know a generation has grown up in this world of surveillance without any perception of what it
[3:53:38.000 --> 3:53:45.760]  is to be without it that's where we are now in this century we're at the gateway again
[3:53:45.760 --> 3:53:53.600]  of a different kind of world order that's already anchored in a digital war that we've already
[3:53:53.600 --> 3:54:03.840]  profoundly lost and needs to be now regained lost ground by legislation by penalties for those
[3:54:03.840 --> 3:54:09.360]  for those that would exploit our private information or any information for that matter
[3:54:10.240 --> 3:54:17.280]  aside from perhaps that that's legitimately collected in a financial transaction like you
[3:54:17.280 --> 3:54:23.120]  do a credit card transaction for instance you can dispute that for six months so i would agree
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:29.200]  everybody gets to keep the data until the dispute period is over some things are two years okay i
[3:54:29.200 --> 3:54:37.520]  agree but how that data is searchable accessible usable that is not a matter of public record
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:43.600]  i think should be greatly constrained and that individuals should have absolute authority
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:51.920]  of their information the way it's being collected manipulated and used should be strictly forbidden
[3:54:51.920 --> 3:54:59.040]  because to use information this way to manipulate political outcomes is the worst of the worst
[3:54:59.040 --> 3:55:05.040]  it's what we predicted in earth rising the revolution earth rising too over 20 years ago
[3:55:05.040 --> 3:55:09.600]  you know when we look at what has happened in this period of time and where we are now
[3:55:10.960 --> 3:55:16.400]  why i believe so strongly i mean continue to speak on these issues is i believe that the
[3:55:16.400 --> 3:55:23.040]  bigger revolution is yet to come you see in the midst of all the chaos and all the trauma you see
[3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:29.360]  in the world is also the transformation because nothing begins without the birth pains of this
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:36.960]  type of human interaction if you will that we're seeing around the world today and i think that's
[3:55:38.160 --> 3:55:44.960]  at the same time demands a higher level of awareness and consciousness as we begin to recognize
[3:55:44.960 --> 3:55:51.120]  that being driven by the flesh by the material is really the wrong answer and globalists are
[3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:56.800]  obsessed with this you know the idea of rfid on every object in the world to track everything in
[3:55:56.800 --> 3:56:03.360]  the world and then the idea of tracking every individual in the world and then the idea of
[3:56:03.360 --> 3:56:09.680]  hooking all of those things and people and all of that together and then you have a profile
[3:56:10.640 --> 3:56:17.440]  that is indeed esoteric but it's managed by man and so it's the opposite of what we are
[3:56:17.440 --> 3:56:25.360]  are it is the absolute opposite of what we are and this is why data valence and surveillance
[3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:29.680]  is so destructive and for a moment i want to talk about what we are we've only got about
[3:56:29.680 --> 3:56:37.360]  a minute left and i want to talk about the idea that as spiritual beings as our focus for a moment
[3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:42.880]  we have the potential to overcome our fear and our anxiety and allow our higher levels
[3:56:42.880 --> 3:56:48.080]  of awareness and consciousness to kick in that's the science of it ladies and gentlemen you have
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:55.040]  to have that for the brain to connect properly to the emotion link into what you are as a spirit
[3:56:55.040 --> 3:56:59.760]  and for you to manifest differently in the world has to be done in a spirit of calmness
[3:57:00.560 --> 3:57:08.320]  and awareness and yet still have the emotional charge that generates the action that's why
[3:57:08.320 --> 3:57:15.760]  across the spectrum we all have a different way of approaching this to change the perception
[3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:22.400]  and the reality and what we also know is when minds and people come together under common ideas
[3:57:22.400 --> 3:57:29.440]  and common philosophy things change this is the import wars this is about change and you're the
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:34.480]  tip of the sphere and the tip of that change in the 21st century if we're going to change it
[3:57:34.480 --> 3:57:40.720]  it begins now in this moment with each of us taking a step to reclaim our individual's solving
