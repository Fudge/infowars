[00:00.000 --> 00:06.600]  We now take you live to the resistance.
[00:06.600 --> 00:10.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence.
[00:10.800 --> 00:20.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's official, the AG is criminally investigating Hillary for being
[00:20.400 --> 00:23.920]  a Russian spy.
[00:23.920 --> 00:27.720]  The whole house of cards is coming down, but first let's get to this key report where
[00:27.720 --> 00:31.080]  YouTube admits massive censorship.
[00:31.080 --> 00:34.400]  YouTube is admitting that they've altered the algorithm and are using human curators
[00:34.400 --> 00:38.960]  to manipulate the search results for certain topics so that the videos that show up as
[00:38.960 --> 00:44.040]  the top results are from mainstream media channels instead of independent channels
[00:44.040 --> 00:47.600]  no matter how popular the videos that they produce are.
[00:47.600 --> 00:50.560]  The way that YouTube used to work is that when you search for a topic, the top search
[00:50.560 --> 00:55.160]  results used to be videos not with the most views as most people think, but videos with
[00:55.160 --> 00:59.400]  the most watch time, meaning that when somebody clicks on a video and if they keep watching
[00:59.400 --> 01:03.440]  it, it starts racking up the amount of time that people are watching it, and that some
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.800]  total adds up to the total watch time, showing that the video is what those people are searching
[01:08.800 --> 01:13.120]  for, not if they just find a video and click off of it immediately because it's deceptive
[01:13.120 --> 01:14.920]  or some clickbait title or something.
[01:14.920 --> 01:20.360]  So the videos used to be relevant to the search or videos that are relevant to the search
[01:20.360 --> 01:22.560]  that people liked watching.
[01:22.560 --> 01:27.000]  But now YouTube is admitting that they've altered the algorithm after searches are turning
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.240]  up videos about conspiracy theories.
[01:30.240 --> 01:33.400]  In fact, my friend Gary Franchi over at the Next News Network sent me this screenshot of
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.480]  some of his analytics showing his video directly being affected by this algorithm.
[01:38.480 --> 01:43.160]  This chart here is the amount of views per hour that his video was getting over a 48-hour
[01:43.160 --> 01:49.640]  period, and so this is about 3,000 views per hour just chugging along, chugging along,
[01:49.640 --> 01:55.440]  drops a little bit there, this is probably early in the morning, 2-3-4 in the morning,
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.880]  starts to pick up again here, and then all of a sudden, boom, such a steep drop-off,
[02:00.880 --> 02:05.320]  which can really only be explained by some change in the algorithm.
[02:05.320 --> 02:11.440]  And just lo and behold, we have YouTube admitting that they changed the algorithm to then favor
[02:11.440 --> 02:13.600]  major news network channels.
[02:13.600 --> 02:17.920]  James O'Keefe's project Veritas recently did an undercover investigation into YouTube,
[02:17.920 --> 02:24.600]  and they got a YouTube employee who is the lead brand and diversity curator to admit
[02:24.600 --> 02:51.600]  that they are censoring independent channels in favor of mainstream news outlets.
[02:51.600 --> 03:12.320]  We can't have people finding Alex Jones' videos too easily.
[03:12.320 --> 03:15.080]  We have to bury those at the bottom of the search results.
[03:15.080 --> 03:17.840]  By the way, did I miss pronoun this person earlier in my video?
[03:17.840 --> 03:18.840]  I didn't mean to.
[03:18.840 --> 03:20.840]  That's a crime in California now.
[03:20.840 --> 03:24.680]  I don't want to get fined to go to jail for calling this thing a guy.
[03:24.680 --> 03:31.000]  By the way, this person's job title is literally brand and diversity curation lead at YouTube,
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.600]  which gives us quite a bit of insight into the manipulation that's going on at YouTube,
[03:35.600 --> 03:37.000]  and who's doing the manipulating.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.640]  Gee, I can't imagine why we have so many conservative videos getting censored on YouTube,
[03:41.640 --> 03:46.000]  getting demonetized, and getting removed for violating the community guidelines when there
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.560]  are people like this making the decisions.
[03:48.560 --> 03:52.680]  By the way, here's the same person during a different part of Project Veritas' investigation.
[03:52.680 --> 03:56.480]  It looks like they're at a different location, different day, wearing a different sweatshirt,
[03:56.480 --> 03:57.480]  and look at this.
[03:57.480 --> 04:01.640]  The sweatshirt says Google printed on the sleeve, and it looks like it also says Black
[04:01.640 --> 04:04.440]  Lives Matter printed on the front.
[04:04.440 --> 04:07.880]  This whole fake news witch hunt at the mainstream media launched immediately after the election
[04:07.880 --> 04:10.880]  last year has primarily been focusing on Facebook.
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.720]  Oh, fake news is spreading through Facebook, Facebook, but they're now focusing on YouTube,
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.920]  and they hate us, and they want us taken down.
[04:17.920 --> 04:22.800]  Here's an article from BuzzFeed, how YouTube serves as the content engine of the internet's
[04:22.800 --> 04:24.560]  dark side.
[04:24.560 --> 04:28.240]  Everybody knows that Twitter and Facebook spread bad information and hate speech, but
[04:28.240 --> 04:34.400]  YouTube, which pays for conspiracy theories seen by millions, may be even worse.
[04:34.400 --> 04:38.440]  By the way, this article came out just only a month before the YouTube adpocalypse, the
[04:38.440 --> 04:45.040]  advertising apocalypse, when YouTube just took their advice and demonetized most news channels.
[04:45.040 --> 04:49.600]  Folks, and it's a lot worse, the Democrats have openly announced a plan to sue info
[04:49.600 --> 04:53.400]  wars out of operation by the end of next year.
[04:53.400 --> 04:54.640]  We're going to expose that.
[04:54.640 --> 04:58.560]  We have all their documents, please stay with us.
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.920]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best
[05:03.920 --> 05:06.080]  selling product, Brainforce.
[05:06.080 --> 05:11.320]  Now Brainforce Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle, and we're now purchasing so much
[05:11.320 --> 05:15.300]  of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able
[05:15.300 --> 05:16.800]  to get it for less.
[05:16.800 --> 05:21.480]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off, and I thought I could offer this for
[05:21.480 --> 05:22.760]  maybe a month.
[05:22.760 --> 05:28.720]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse
[05:28.720 --> 05:33.400]  because the fans of it, already you're stocking up, they know how great it is, a whole bunch
[05:33.400 --> 05:37.520]  of organic, natural, healthy, known, new tropics.
[05:37.520 --> 05:42.840]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then Brainforce is for you and you're supporting
[05:42.840 --> 05:45.640]  the broadcast at the same time.
[05:45.640 --> 05:47.440]  It's a good deal at $39.
[05:47.440 --> 05:57.400]  It's 1996 at infowarslife.com or simply call toll free, triple eight, two five three three
[05:57.400 --> 05:58.400]  one three nine.
[05:58.400 --> 06:10.760]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:10.760 --> 06:19.760]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:19.760 --> 06:25.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the 18th day of October 2017 on this Wednesday edition.
[06:25.080 --> 06:31.920]  We are reaching record numbers of people every day across the planet, all part of our amazing
[06:31.920 --> 06:39.920]  human race, despite the admissions of major governments, major corporations, major bureaucracies
[06:39.920 --> 06:42.640]  to censor info wars.
[06:42.640 --> 06:49.160]  And yours truly and our team, and that means censor you and your will and your support
[06:49.160 --> 06:58.360]  for this broadcast, because we are seen by the globalist as the heart, as the spirit,
[06:58.360 --> 07:02.840]  as the Bible of resistance to their globalist operations.
[07:02.840 --> 07:08.360]  And instead of just blowing me up at a car bomb, which would turn me into a martyr, they
[07:08.360 --> 07:17.760]  are trying to destroy who I am and who info wars is by building straw men and straw women
[07:17.760 --> 07:24.000]  that do not represent us that are facsimiles, and then advertising that fraud and then discrediting
[07:24.000 --> 07:34.360]  that fraud and destroying that fraud, not the real McCoy, not the bona fide real deal.
[07:34.360 --> 07:40.760]  We are witnessing a private corporate world government openly at war with the nation state
[07:40.760 --> 07:47.080]  and all forms of independence, all forms of freedom, the family.
[07:47.080 --> 07:49.480]  This is their stated goal.
[07:49.480 --> 07:54.800]  And they've gone from denying it's their goal, building it in the shadows, to now openly
[07:54.800 --> 08:05.080]  coming out and saying it is their sworn operation and their sworn directive to attack Christians,
[08:05.080 --> 08:11.800]  to attack the West, to create cultural and racial divides, to medicalize the populations
[08:11.800 --> 08:18.160]  through medical tyranny, to deindustrialize and make the population completely dependent,
[08:18.160 --> 08:25.400]  to move people also away from the farms and ranches and to make us completely domesticated
[08:25.400 --> 08:26.400]  and controlled.
[08:26.400 --> 08:33.920]  We are facing 21st century, high tech, eugenics based technocracy.
[08:33.920 --> 08:40.640]  Terms like deep state shadow government, false flag, all of these are terms I popularized
[08:40.640 --> 08:45.040]  on this broadcast that are now household terms and words.
[08:45.040 --> 08:48.040]  I'm not giving myself credit.
[08:48.040 --> 08:53.520]  Listeners though need to understand what you're watching and what you're listening to is what
[08:53.520 --> 08:58.960]  the enemy fears and that's for a very important reason.
[08:58.960 --> 09:00.920]  We understand the globalist operation.
[09:00.920 --> 09:05.880]  We've simply studied their own program and their own operation and we know that if we
[09:05.880 --> 09:13.120]  expose that it's horribly anti-human, extremely authoritarian, viciously greedy and hateful
[09:13.120 --> 09:20.160]  and covetous of information and freedom and that it seeks to enslave humanity and seeks
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.080]  to break us down into biological artificialities.
[09:24.080 --> 09:31.360]  You see, it's not like Blade Runner where humans create a race of superhumans to serve
[09:31.360 --> 09:32.360]  them.
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.480]  This is where the technocracy, the elites who've never been able to capture and fully
[09:36.480 --> 09:44.880]  control humanity, biologically turn us into artificial biological facsimiles of what we
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.640]  were through genetic engineering, through the GMO, through the vaccines, through the
[09:49.640 --> 09:55.040]  culture, through the food, through the water, through the programming until we are no longer
[09:55.040 --> 10:05.400]  human and need them to exist, making them masters artificially over humanity by removing
[10:05.400 --> 10:06.400]  our humanity.
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.560]  It's the only way they can conquer free will.
[10:10.560 --> 10:19.240]  And we see every metric, the cancer, the neurological disorders, the gut disorders, the skin disorders,
[10:19.240 --> 10:26.040]  every new disease popping out every week, the life expectancy plunging, infant mortality
[10:26.040 --> 10:33.600]  exploding, diabetes, type 1 and 2, up multi-thousand percentage points, pediatric cancers up over
[10:33.600 --> 10:39.360]  20-plus thousand percent, many are 10,000, but some are over 20,000 percent up.
[10:39.360 --> 10:43.040]  It is a biological holocaust.
[10:43.040 --> 10:48.840]  And the globalists divert you from all their real biological and chemical holocaust by
[10:48.840 --> 10:55.480]  claiming they want to carbon tax, carbon dioxide, and oh, they're going to sue your company
[10:55.480 --> 11:02.960]  because your clothes have 20 times less lead in them than an apple does or kale does, but
[11:02.960 --> 11:09.720]  then they're going to spread HIV and hepatitis and all the rest of it, forcibly putting into
[11:09.720 --> 11:10.960]  the blood supply.
[11:10.960 --> 11:13.040]  I'm talking about California.
[11:13.040 --> 11:14.200]  You want to know the future.
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.160]  Look at Sweden, look at California, look at Germany, look at the UK, look at all the
[11:18.160 --> 11:24.440]  programming and that's the future they've got in store for all of us.
[11:24.440 --> 11:26.440]  Bottom line, they're coming for you and your family.
[11:26.440 --> 11:28.280]  Look at the Washington Post headline.
[11:28.280 --> 11:33.680]  California makes it a misdemeanor to kill somebody with HIV.
[11:33.680 --> 11:36.920]  Let's continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:36.920 --> 11:39.520]  This is a hate letter to humanity.
[11:39.520 --> 11:41.640]  This is a global takeover.
[11:41.640 --> 11:45.120]  This is total and complete bloodthirsty domination.
[11:45.120 --> 11:52.200]  All posing with a simpering NPR voice meant to put you into a trance.
[11:52.200 --> 11:58.080]  Everything they do is about putting you into a trance, having you sleep, sleep, give in
[11:58.080 --> 12:06.200]  your will, give in your will, simply turn on the Netflix, drink another beer, sleep, sleep.
[12:06.200 --> 12:07.960]  Don't worry about it today.
[12:07.960 --> 12:14.640]  Let us run things, talk like we talk, use only the words we say, join our cult, everything
[12:14.640 --> 12:20.720]  will be okay, come on in, the water is fine, sleep, sleep.
[12:20.720 --> 12:23.560]  Everything we do is about awaken.
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.560]  The sleeper must awaken, the giant must awaken, look around you, you're being forced into
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.320]  an artificial matrix system.
[12:32.320 --> 12:38.280]  So that's the big challenge we're up against, but it's the animating contest of liberty
[12:38.280 --> 12:42.280]  and that's why they hate us because it came out in the Wall Street Journal yesterday,
[12:42.280 --> 12:51.360]  I meant to cover it, I didn't, please print me the Wall Street Journal.
[12:51.360 --> 12:57.400]  George Soros, the admitted Nazi collaborator, who CNN says is not a Nazi collaborator, talk
[12:57.400 --> 13:00.800]  about next level fake news and then I made it up even though he's on 60 minutes saying
[13:00.800 --> 13:08.680]  it, normally gives here in the United States every year about $500 million from swindles
[13:08.680 --> 13:12.200]  he's engaged in and bankrupting economies all over the world.
[13:12.200 --> 13:15.480]  And he admittedly gave over a billion of his swindled money, he's just a front guy for
[13:15.480 --> 13:20.080]  intelligence agencies to the State Department, $5 billion to overthrow the elected government
[13:20.080 --> 13:21.800]  of Ukraine and start a civil war there.
[13:21.800 --> 13:26.400]  He also funded part of the Arab Spring, but he's just one of the top generals of this
[13:26.400 --> 13:28.400]  satanic order.
[13:28.400 --> 13:35.400]  He is now transferring $18 billion to his foundation to directly battle the American
[13:35.400 --> 13:40.920]  people and nationalist movements worldwide and he says it, there's the headline, George
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.840]  Soros transfers $18 billion to his foundation, creating an instant giant.
[13:45.840 --> 13:51.960]  Now, what are they doing simultaneously on every so-called late night comedy show, claiming
[13:51.960 --> 13:56.040]  that I'm a snake oil salesman and that all our products are pure crap, even though most
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.200]  of them are private labeled, the very ones sold by Jeff Bezos and Whole Foods, that all
[14:00.200 --> 14:04.240]  the leftist watchdog groups completely leave alone.
[14:04.240 --> 14:10.000]  And they're openly calling for my arrest and Gwyneth Paltrow's arrest, they picked her
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.320]  out as a liberal figurehead so it wouldn't look as political when they try to have us
[14:14.320 --> 14:18.600]  both arrested, which is ongoing admittedly right now.
[14:18.600 --> 14:23.680]  Simply because they don't want us to get millions of dollars at Info Wars to then fund this
[14:23.680 --> 14:32.960]  operation to fight the $18 billion of a foreign Nazi collaborator, a literal monster creature
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.560]  that funded the radical Arab Spring to murder women that were going to college, murder gays,
[14:38.560 --> 14:46.360]  murder priests, blow up hundreds of churches in Syria and Egypt alone, mass murder everywhere.
[14:46.360 --> 14:47.600]  This is how they operate.
[14:47.600 --> 14:55.000]  So his $18 billion of filthy money is to run lawsuits and is to go after the NRA and is
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.240]  to go after Info Wars and is to go after the Free Press and is to lobby Congress and is
[15:01.240 --> 15:06.600]  to overthrow nation states, that's the admitted open society's main program.
[15:06.600 --> 15:11.480]  But it's all philanthropic, see, he puts his dirty money from everything you can imagine,
[15:11.480 --> 15:17.680]  currency speculation, it goes on and on with all his insider knowledge from the globalist
[15:17.680 --> 15:22.280]  to overthrowing countries and smashing the Trump Revolution, you can say what you want
[15:22.280 --> 15:26.320]  about Trump, but at least he's trying to be the president and you know him by all his
[15:26.320 --> 15:28.640]  authoritarian enemies.
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.040]  The Hollywood director Rick Linkletter came out and said, you know, Alan's has always
[15:32.040 --> 15:36.560]  been anti-establishment, anti-power structure, I don't know why he's pro-power structure,
[15:36.560 --> 15:41.320]  pro-power structure, we have the whole global power structure coming down against America
[15:41.320 --> 15:45.040]  and our desperate attempt to just at least get control of our government again, that's
[15:45.040 --> 15:48.560]  why they hate Trump because he believes America should be run by America.
[15:48.560 --> 15:49.560]  Is he perfect?
[15:49.560 --> 15:52.000]  No, but he's an American and I stand with him.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.880]  I stand with you and we'll never back down.
[15:57.880 --> 15:59.480]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[15:59.480 --> 16:04.280]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[16:04.280 --> 16:07.960]  I buy some, I use some, I store some, awesome.
[16:07.960 --> 16:13.400]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life, NASA PAC technology, bacon.
[16:13.400 --> 16:18.920]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the PAC bacon or warm and serve.
[16:18.920 --> 16:25.720]  Lifesaving ready to eat bacon, 10-year shelf life bacon, ships free at fullycookedbacon.com.
[16:25.720 --> 16:27.520]  Fullycookedbacon.com.
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.880]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.

[18:07.720 --> 18:11.800]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:11.800 --> 18:16.120]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:16.120 --> 18:21.440]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[19:39.800 --> 19:41.200]  the stakes are too high.
[19:41.200 --> 19:44.960]  The globalists win, we're all slaves, so don't think before what I'm doing, I want to thank
[19:44.960 --> 19:45.960]  you.
[19:45.960 --> 19:46.960]  We're all in this together.

[19:53.200 --> 20:00.960]  Again, visit infoawardstore.com today and commit to helping the Info War.
[20:00.960 --> 20:26.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.960 --> 20:39.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:39.520 --> 20:44.520]  The globalists are already living in about 2040.
[20:44.520 --> 20:47.200]  Technology-wise, they're thrown at mission.
[20:47.200 --> 20:53.320]  They believe they'll soon break completely away from this former civilization.
[20:53.320 --> 20:57.200]  We are to then be orderly, exterminated.
[20:57.200 --> 21:04.520]  It'll be done high-tech, where you basically beg for it.
[21:04.520 --> 21:08.680]  But if you're aware of the operation, you can defeat it.
[21:08.680 --> 21:11.080]  By the way, there's no joining it.
[21:11.080 --> 21:17.440]  A lot of people who are soulless or mercenary buy into it short-term.
[21:17.440 --> 21:22.040]  They are dishonorable, blind people.
[21:22.040 --> 21:27.000]  Okay, next segment, I'm going to get into the big enchilada.
[21:27.000 --> 21:36.240]  The House of Cards is falling in a spectacular way of Robert Mueller covering up the activities
[21:36.240 --> 21:41.480]  of the Clintons, the Democratic Party, in a giant orgy being paid off by the Communist
[21:41.480 --> 21:44.000]  Chinese, the Russians, and others.
[21:44.000 --> 21:54.800]  And we have Attorney General Sessions in the Judiciary Committee today, reporting that
[21:54.800 --> 22:00.400]  he is looking in a criminal investigation of Hillary for basic espionage against this
[22:00.400 --> 22:01.400]  republic.
[22:01.400 --> 22:10.840]  Now, we have Mueller transferring uranium illegally in a bag to the Russians.
[22:10.840 --> 22:17.720]  We have the Democratic Party, most of them getting $10, $15, $20, $30 million a piece.
[22:17.720 --> 22:22.720]  I mean, the high-level Democrats were all getting paid off by the Russians.
[22:22.720 --> 22:26.600]  That's what governments do, and we're wide open to espionage in this country via the
[22:26.600 --> 22:27.600]  Democratic Party.
[22:27.600 --> 22:31.040]  They've always been the ones that have been working with the Russians.
[22:31.040 --> 22:37.000]  They helped put the Bolsheviks in in 1917 and visited that social engineering hell on
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.040]  the Russians they now want here.
[22:39.040 --> 22:41.040]  They'll keep going.
[22:41.040 --> 22:42.040]  This is like what they did in Russia.
[22:42.040 --> 22:43.040]  Why is it so similar?
[22:43.040 --> 22:44.040]  And why is Russia fighting it?
[22:44.040 --> 22:49.040]  Because they already got the face sucker after 80-plus years off their face, partially.
[22:49.040 --> 22:53.600]  Yes, the New York Liberals funded the Bolshevik Revolution.
[22:53.600 --> 22:54.600]  That's public.
[22:54.600 --> 22:58.440]  That's in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[22:58.440 --> 22:59.600]  The left doesn't play games.
[22:59.600 --> 23:01.040]  They'll butcher you and your family.
[23:01.040 --> 23:02.040]  They get a chance.
[23:02.040 --> 23:05.720]  As long as you're Christian, they want to get you in that FEMA camp and stomp your guts
[23:05.720 --> 23:06.720]  out.
[23:06.720 --> 23:08.040]  I'm not saying that rhetorically.
[23:08.040 --> 23:11.640]  The average leftist wants to literally murder you and your family.
[23:11.640 --> 23:12.640]  And we now all see it.
[23:12.640 --> 23:13.640]  They hate America.
[23:13.640 --> 23:14.640]  They hate God.
[23:14.640 --> 23:15.640]  They hate working.
[23:15.640 --> 23:22.880]  They're just a bunch of litigious devil-worshiping scum that hate you because you're strong,
[23:22.880 --> 23:27.760]  you're honorable, you're good-looking, and you got what they don't have, a conscience
[23:27.760 --> 23:29.640]  and a connection to God.
[23:29.640 --> 23:33.560]  And they're not going to stop till they've sexualized every one of your children and
[23:33.560 --> 23:38.040]  until they've wrecked your whole society and until they've broken down everything and until
[23:38.040 --> 23:41.360]  they've bankrupted the country.
[23:41.360 --> 23:43.760]  Just remember that.
[23:43.760 --> 23:46.920]  They want to shoot you up with as much lead and mercury as they can.
[23:46.920 --> 23:49.240]  They want to brain damage your family.
[23:49.240 --> 23:53.200]  They want to see you absolutely sterile and die in a cancer so they can suck all the money
[23:53.200 --> 23:54.200]  out of you.
[23:54.200 --> 23:57.080]  And they're never going to quit because they're the enemy.
[23:57.080 --> 24:00.040]  They will not coexist with us.
[24:00.040 --> 24:02.800]  They want to just absolutely rape everything.
[24:02.800 --> 24:05.840]  They hate my guts because I know who they are.
[24:05.840 --> 24:10.840]  And now I realize even their low-level supporters are actually in on it.
[24:10.840 --> 24:11.840]  They were never liberals.
[24:11.840 --> 24:13.320]  They were always fake.
[24:13.320 --> 24:16.000]  They always had a plan.
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.280]  They don't coexist.
[24:17.280 --> 24:23.600]  They will absorb you and destroy you because they have envy.
[24:23.600 --> 24:27.480]  If you're a good person, they spiritually hate you.
[24:27.480 --> 24:31.000]  Now, coming up in the next segment, we're going to go over all of it.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  It's huge.
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  So important.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.880]  Here's a brief clip of the attorney general saying, yeah, they're criminally probing
[24:36.880 --> 24:37.880]  Hitler-y.
[24:37.880 --> 24:38.880]  Here it is.
[24:38.880 --> 24:46.960]  I'd like to remind you that Deputy Attorney Rosenstein directly supervised the criminal
[24:46.960 --> 24:50.120]  case when he was U.S. Attorney in Maryland.
[24:50.120 --> 24:55.600]  I don't think it would be proper for him to supervise a review of his own conduct.
[24:55.600 --> 24:57.100]  Do you?
[24:57.100 --> 24:58.600]  It would be his decision.
[24:58.600 --> 25:04.160]  He's a man of integrity and ability if he feels that he has an inability to proceed
[25:04.160 --> 25:06.400]  with any investigation.
[25:06.400 --> 25:11.760]  It would be his responsibility to make that determination and should consult, as I told
[25:11.760 --> 25:19.000]  you, I would and as I have done with the senior ethics people at the department.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.880]  Reports suggest that the Clinton Foundation received millions of dollars from interested
[25:22.880 --> 25:25.560]  parties in the transaction.
[25:25.560 --> 25:31.320]  Well, Clinton received 500,000 for a speech in Moscow, June 2010, from the Russian government
[25:31.320 --> 25:32.480]  Align Bank.
[25:32.480 --> 25:37.980]  The same month as the speech, Russia began the uranium acquisition process.
[25:37.980 --> 25:43.800]  This fact pattern raises serious concerns about improper political influence on the
[25:43.800 --> 25:52.000]  process by the previous, by the Clintons during the Obama administration, as the Justice
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.200]  Department fully investigated whether the Russians compromised the Obama administration's
[25:57.200 --> 26:03.400]  decisions to smooth the way for transactions, and if not, why not?
[26:03.400 --> 26:07.520]  Mr. Chairman, we're working hard to maintain discipline in the department.
[26:07.520 --> 26:13.240]  It wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on any ongoing investigation.
[26:13.240 --> 26:17.120]  Wouldn't be proper for me to comment on any ongoing investigation.
[26:17.120 --> 26:18.560]  They're investigating Hillary.
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.760]  Now, where did you hear about uranium-1?
[26:22.760 --> 26:28.160]  Where'd you hear about Podesta's time and the barrel was coming?
[26:28.160 --> 26:37.280]  Right here, last year, early in the campaign, early in 2016, and then suddenly, Roger Shown
[26:37.280 --> 26:46.520]  and I, we were the Russians because we were the dutiful, dog-like, hound-like, patriot-Americans
[26:46.520 --> 26:49.640]  going after the foreign manipulation.
[26:49.640 --> 26:53.600]  Now, the only reason Russia's coming up is because they accused Trump of it, and there's
[26:53.600 --> 26:55.640]  no evidence that the Clintons are involved.
[26:55.640 --> 26:57.880]  Russia is nothing compared to the Chinese Communist.
[26:57.880 --> 27:03.000]  I mean, the Chinese communists have basically taken over Hollywood, the mainstream media,
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.320]  half the Democratic Party.
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.240]  I mean, we are under deep espionage by the Chai Cubs.
[27:09.240 --> 27:11.120]  I'm not defending what Russia's done.
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.680]  We've exposed it.
[27:12.680 --> 27:14.760]  But it's all coming out now.
[27:14.760 --> 27:16.160]  How beautiful is that?
[27:16.160 --> 27:21.000]  And Mueller, of course, has been viciously going after Trump because he knows he's involved
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.680]  as a bag man with the Clintons and his law firm and the companies he's involved with,
[27:25.680 --> 27:31.240]  personally getting the Russian money and most of it's secret and covering up with the Clintons
[27:31.240 --> 27:33.600]  and blocking the investigation.
[27:33.600 --> 27:39.120]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, because we're willing to break this first and force it out, so a
[27:39.120 --> 27:45.040]  year and a half later, you're now seeing it in the news, where the target?
[27:45.040 --> 27:48.960]  Ladies have congressional hearings, they keep saying, the vector is in full force.
[27:48.960 --> 27:51.240]  The vector is Jones.
[27:51.240 --> 27:53.240]  The vector is Drudge.
[27:53.240 --> 27:55.120]  They know the vectors.
[27:55.120 --> 28:00.440]  They know who keeps injecting truth, who is patient zero for the disease of liberty and
[28:00.440 --> 28:03.160]  awakening that will bring down their filthy tyranny.
[28:03.160 --> 28:06.680]  But they see us as a disease.
[28:06.680 --> 28:11.800]  So that's why you need to commit to financially support us and buy the t-shirts, the books,
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.680]  the videos, the supplements, all of them and sign up for auto ship and get an additional

[28:21.480 --> 28:25.160]  the places you see and behind the scenes, I'm not going to get into at this point, but
[28:25.160 --> 28:32.920]  I will by governments, state governments, federal unamens, stay behind networks, globalist
[28:32.920 --> 28:37.960]  disinfo squads, infiltration operations, you name it, we are the American Republic.
[28:37.960 --> 28:43.120]  We are the resistance and we don't get Soros money from bankrupted overthrown countries
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.240]  and Arab Springs, that murderer funds, that Nazi piece of garbage.
[28:47.240 --> 28:51.880]  We're funded by you and if you'll fund us, I guarantee you this pledge, I'm never giving
[28:51.880 --> 28:57.880]  up and I'm going to ram these people right back to hell.

[33:00.480 --> 33:10.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:10.440 --> 33:14.640]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[33:14.640 --> 33:20.000]  But to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it, I mean you must
[33:20.000 --> 33:22.440]  be a threat if they call you out by name.
[33:22.440 --> 33:23.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:23.440 --> 33:24.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:24.440 --> 33:25.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:25.440 --> 33:26.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:26.440 --> 33:30.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:30.440 --> 33:31.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:31.440 --> 33:32.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:32.440 --> 33:33.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:33.440 --> 33:34.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:34.440 --> 33:35.440]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[33:35.440 --> 33:36.440]  Because they know that these are legitimate use of organizations.
[33:36.440 --> 33:37.440]  And at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex
[33:37.440 --> 33:38.440]  Jones.
[33:38.440 --> 33:39.440]  Well, they were looking for him to be a method.
[33:39.440 --> 33:40.440]  That man is a threat to this country.
[33:40.440 --> 33:41.440]  There's a guy on the radio.
[33:41.440 --> 33:42.440]  His name is Alex Jones.
[33:42.440 --> 33:43.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:43.440 --> 33:44.440]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[33:44.440 --> 34:01.440]  Time to stop submitting in this charity.
[34:01.440 --> 34:02.440]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[34:02.440 --> 34:03.440]  I heard that on Alex Jones.
[34:03.440 --> 34:04.440]  Info wars went even further.
[34:04.440 --> 34:05.440]  Info wars.

[34:16.840 --> 34:18.000]  Info wars.com.
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.720]  Info wars comes to mind.

[34:27.860 --> 34:28.860]  Info wars.
[34:28.860 --> 34:29.860]  I've got a chag going.
[34:29.860 --> 34:32.160]  Looking at widely reported information from data.
[34:32.160 --> 34:33.140]  Info wars.
[34:33.140 --> 34:34.140]  Info wars.
[34:34.140 --> 34:35.140]  Info wars.

[34:40.200 --> 34:41.600]  Info wars.
[34:41.600 --> 34:42.600]  I want freedom.
[34:42.600 --> 34:43.600]  That's what I want.
[34:43.600 --> 34:44.360]  And that's what Jason wants.
[34:44.360 --> 34:46.840]  What you need to listen to Alex Jones
[34:58.320 --> 35:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Let's jump right into news that for our listeners and viewers
[35:04.600 --> 35:06.600]  Is a year and a half old?
[35:06.920 --> 35:13.540]  It was February 2016. We first wrote articles and did live video slash radio reports
[35:13.540 --> 35:19.540]  Breaking down the previous FBI investigation under Robert Mueller
[35:20.620 --> 35:26.280]  Before Comey came in of the Clintons selling out to Russia uranium deals you name it
[35:27.940 --> 35:33.960]  Gas prom gas and oil deals. We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars to their foundation
[35:33.960 --> 35:40.480]  Not just the millions total in speeches they gave in Moscow now imagine if Trump
[35:43.720 --> 35:50.960]  Was giving uranium on the tarmac of some of the strongest pure issue uranium ever discovered to
[35:53.320 --> 36:01.000]  That the Federal Security Bureau the FSB or the equivalent of the Russian KGB
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.880]  Slash FBI they were both hats in the FSB
[36:06.600 --> 36:08.600]  former KGB
[36:08.960 --> 36:13.200]  Imagine if Trump was giving uranium in a silver
[36:13.960 --> 36:15.960]  James Bond style briefcase
[36:16.760 --> 36:18.760]  To them for Hillary Clinton
[36:19.480 --> 36:27.320]  That's mainstream news and then the same Mueller years later comes in as a special counsel
[36:27.320 --> 36:34.880]  Really a prosecutor and only goes after Trump and says oh my gosh Trump's son
[36:36.040 --> 36:41.960]  Met for 10 minutes with a lady claiming that she had proofs that Hillary was paid off by Russians
[36:41.960 --> 36:44.960]  Of course the campaign was looking into that they better be
[36:46.800 --> 36:50.680]  But they didn't need to meet with her it was in the New York Times in 2015
[36:50.880 --> 36:56.600]  We've already covered this but what's the big news now in the Hill report and others and
[36:56.600 --> 37:01.000]  Hannity breaking it down one of the few good outlets left on Fox
[37:02.440 --> 37:04.440]  We have the documents
[37:05.160 --> 37:10.120]  We have the witnesses. We have the FBI reports that were given to Mueller and
[37:11.040 --> 37:18.320]  then to Comey that were completely and totally killed because Mueller's law firm and
[37:19.720 --> 37:25.120]  Companies that Mueller sits on the boards of are heavily invested with state-run
[37:25.120 --> 37:33.280]  Mining and energy companies and gas companies and wait for it defense companies in Russia
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.120]  And it's in the FBI investigation Hillary as a secretary of state was signing
[37:39.480 --> 37:43.480]  waivers just as Tosh Plumlee told us on air. Let's get Tosh back on
[37:44.480 --> 37:51.120]  Farmer CIA contractor very famous even involved the Bay of Pigs Tosh Plumlee said look it's all about Hillary and
[37:51.120 --> 37:57.520]  And the import-export bands that the State Department has she's operating her own government under Obama
[37:57.520 --> 38:04.920]  He said this was the start of Obama's second term and they are the ones flying the weapons in and out of
[38:06.640 --> 38:14.280]  The US all over the world and fast and furious was part of a weapons program into Mexico into the Middle East to fund the
[38:14.280 --> 38:16.280]  Arab Spring that started five years ago
[38:16.280 --> 38:20.840]  Everything Tosh Plumlee told you was completely classified
[38:21.840 --> 38:27.640]  Directly from NATO and the CIA and the Army and a shadow group in the shadow group
[38:28.080 --> 38:30.080]  battling against this sellout of the country
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.400]  They death-threatening the Justice Department called him they threatened us we moved forward and I'm not telling you
[38:37.400 --> 38:42.200]  Hey, aren't we great? I'm explaining to you that we've done what nobody else will do
[38:42.200 --> 38:48.120]  We have executed on every cylinder. We have told you the truth. We have over delivered
[38:48.920 --> 38:51.760]  Because we're not given into the globalist, but you need to understand
[38:53.600 --> 38:59.960]  They are coming after us with censorship and control and behind-the-scenes stuff that I'm not ready to get into yet
[39:00.800 --> 39:05.320]  openly to shut us down you name it and I'm just gonna stop right there
[39:06.600 --> 39:08.600]  So we need your prayers and
[39:08.600 --> 39:15.280]  And we need your financial support and we need you more than that to spread the articles and the videos and get around
[39:15.280 --> 39:19.000]  The sensors and the blocking on Google and YouTube and Facebook and Twitter
[39:19.280 --> 39:25.060]  Hand deliver the stories print them off download the videos have your neighbors over show them
[39:25.080 --> 39:30.600]  You can show them Google executives saying number one goal stop Alex Jones
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.440]  Because they know who blew them wide open on the Devil worship child molestation stuff that they had to then change the
[39:38.440 --> 39:43.320]  Subject on and claim we'd retract it totally made up who blew them wide open on the Russia issues
[39:44.920 --> 39:51.520]  Who blew them wide open over and over again info wars and our platform of guests people like colonel Schaefer and
[39:52.240 --> 40:00.640]  Dr. Corsi and Matt drudge who came here exclusively almost two years ago and laid out everything to you that was gonna happen in the next few years from a
[40:02.120 --> 40:07.360]  High-level Supreme Court justice and other people who'd been even higher in the government
[40:07.360 --> 40:09.360]  And I'm gonna stop right there
[40:09.880 --> 40:17.200]  We've had sources at the highest levels of this plan because there were people who weren't perfect
[40:17.360 --> 40:23.880]  But they weren't out to get America and they didn't want to bankrupt the country and they didn't want to transfer our power to communist China
[40:24.920 --> 40:30.400]  They're the globalists selling the country out and they know we're awake. They know we're informed and they're scared
[40:31.320 --> 40:33.560]  we come back I'm gonna play a boil down of the
[40:33.560 --> 40:41.880]  Judiciary committee hearings and then excerpts of Hannity last night where they did break a lot of new info, but confirming everything we told you
[40:44.080 --> 40:46.080]  19 months ago
[40:46.720 --> 40:51.200]  Everything that we broke down here. No wonder they called us Russian spies
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.280]  What are you gonna do when you're on tarmacs with uranium illegally for Hillary?
[40:56.680 --> 41:02.000]  Transferring to the Russians and then Hillary's doing deals selling out one-third of our uranium to uranium one
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.120]  What are you gonna do when you're the international globalist selling out nation-states to the highest bidder actual traders?
[41:10.880 --> 41:12.880]  What are you gonna do
[41:12.880 --> 41:19.760]  You're gonna blame your enemies the American people for what you are. We're the people getting us out of TPP
[41:20.160 --> 41:23.000]  We're the folks getting us out of globalism unelected groups
[41:23.200 --> 41:30.240]  We're the patriots fighting to get the jobs back to take care of the veterans to cut the taxes to get the economy going to
[41:30.240 --> 41:38.480]  Stabilize the Republic to cut the size of the federal government and we're delivering delivering delivering delivering because you
[41:39.240 --> 41:44.680]  The American people of every race color and creed who are just one race red-blooded humans
[41:45.160 --> 41:51.480]  Understand what's happening and understand what the elites doing and know when you see the whole mainstream media against somebody
[41:51.560 --> 41:55.320]  You know, they're the establishment and you know who they're attacking the good guys
[41:55.480 --> 41:58.640]  And you know we're fighting as hard as we can right here with you
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.760]  But you better understand there's a civil war in this country right now in information warfare
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.080]  They're trying to start a physical one to beat up and attack and intimidate everybody
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.360]  So that we supposedly back down and give up. Let me tell you something
[42:13.360 --> 42:16.240]  I got so much energy fighting you people
[42:17.160 --> 42:21.160]  That I absolutely love it that I'm enemy number one next to Trump
[42:21.160 --> 42:29.640]  My only frustration is that I can't execute good enough to take you down and I'm not strong enough or smart enough to get you faster
[42:29.640 --> 42:33.640]  I'm so angry at myself. We're not doing more and not being stronger
[42:33.880 --> 42:41.040]  And I've seen every angle they got coming and I usually don't even execute on it when we have total victory if I started truly
[42:41.360 --> 42:45.120]  Executing but I swear before God on the altar of liberty
[42:45.120 --> 42:53.080]  Eternal resistance to you to quote Thomas Jefferson and I ask God to take full control of me and help me do a better job

[47:53.240 --> 47:56.640]  In fact reportedly Julian Assange coming up
[47:57.800 --> 48:01.400]  In just a few weeks is gonna drop the motherload hammer
[48:02.840 --> 48:04.320]  On
[48:04.320 --> 48:07.480]  Mueller and all of his Russian collusion so get ready for that
[48:07.520 --> 48:13.360]  He kept waiting to see a Mueller would drop the made-up Trump investigation and actually go after the Clintons
[48:13.360 --> 48:17.080]  But he hasn't so that's all going to be coming reportedly
[48:17.080 --> 48:23.400]  According to our boffins at 4chan have been proven to be about a thousand times more accurate than CNN
[48:23.640 --> 48:26.640]  But look at these tweets from L president a
[48:27.240 --> 48:33.960]  Donald John Trump the guy that would never be president. Wow FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter
[48:35.560 --> 48:42.440]  Exonerating crooked Hillary long before investigation was complete. We told you that a month ago
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.440]  I just love how mainstream media always sits on stuff
[48:46.440 --> 48:51.960]  You literally get news here days weeks months or years or decades before I mean, it's just true
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.560]  That's why they hate us because see we'll put it out there first when we have the documentation
[48:58.560 --> 49:03.480]  Or other great researchers will have them on we're just a big focal point of human intelligence
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.760]  And then it builds and builds and then forces out mainstream. I mean that that's why they hate us
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.640]  And I just keep telling you that because they're coming after his folks. They're coming after you
[49:13.640 --> 49:17.200]  They're coming after anybody that stands up for you when you stand up with us
[49:17.880 --> 49:24.920]  Here's Trump people not interviewed including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't
[49:26.240 --> 49:28.240]  Do this obviously a fix
[49:29.160 --> 49:35.440]  Again, comey stated under oath that he did not do this, but he did it's obviously a fix. Where is the Justice Department?
[49:36.640 --> 49:38.240]  These are Trump's tweets
[49:38.240 --> 49:43.440]  Last night as it has turned out James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton
[49:43.440 --> 49:46.000]  He was the best thing that ever happened to her
[49:46.920 --> 49:53.680]  And he lied and said that he didn't leak the memos, but he did and then he lied about what was in the memos
[49:53.680 --> 49:57.200]  I mean, of course, they're a pack of literal criminals
[49:57.520 --> 50:04.680]  colluding with Russia China and everybody else shelling us out to the TPP that would have more power than Congress
[50:04.680 --> 50:07.240]  Rick link letter is in the Daily Beast article
[50:08.400 --> 50:09.600]  Asking
[50:09.600 --> 50:12.480]  Famous director friend of mine. I wouldn't even call him Hollywood. He's Austin
[50:13.600 --> 50:15.600]  He's a good director smart guy
[50:16.160 --> 50:21.240]  He's like I don't know why Alex is always anti establishment, but now he seems to be pro establishment pro establishment
[50:21.240 --> 50:27.720]  You've got the whole global government the mega banks the power structure trying to stop Trump from jump-starting the economy
[50:28.360 --> 50:30.360]  Trump's like a medic with defibrillators
[50:30.880 --> 50:32.880]  Trying to shock my heart back
[50:32.880 --> 50:37.240]  He could be a bank robber. I'd still wanting to turn my heart back on but he's not
[50:38.400 --> 50:43.640]  Trump is a champion Trump is demonized thousands of lawsuits against him death threats
[50:43.640 --> 50:47.480]  They're his whole family's under attack and I am a fellow traveler. I
[50:48.640 --> 50:53.200]  Am experiencing what Trump is experiencing to a lesser degree and it makes me absolutely
[50:53.920 --> 51:00.240]  See him as a kindred spirit. We are brothers in arms in the battle for America in the second American Revolution
[51:00.240 --> 51:05.640]  So you bet Rick link letter who said nice stuff about me in the in the article
[51:05.640 --> 51:08.560]  They tried to get him to do a hit piece. He's promoting his new film
[51:11.120 --> 51:16.520]  They're saying why'd you put him in movies, you know, was he like this before like this before I was anti-establishment
[51:16.800 --> 51:20.080]  Because the globalists were in full control. This is our counter-revolution
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.120]  This is us trying to take the flag back and we're having victory
[51:25.080 --> 51:27.080]  to total war
[51:27.080 --> 51:33.120]  This isn't hype folks look around you what's going on. This is epic and
[51:34.480 --> 51:36.480]  We're winning every special election
[51:38.120 --> 51:42.480]  Libertarians are taking the Republican Party over our vision that we launched 10 years ago
[51:43.400 --> 51:46.600]  With the Tea Party to take over the Republican Party is happening
[51:47.160 --> 51:52.280]  It's unfolding. We're promoting an ideology that's popular and sexy and successful
[51:52.280 --> 51:57.920]  We're promoting 57 Chevy's and Marilyn Monroe against a North Korean or Venezuelan model
[51:57.960 --> 52:00.720]  We're going to win if we execute
[52:01.640 --> 52:03.640]  prosperity
[52:04.280 --> 52:09.560]  The only problem is can you handle all the success? Can you handle all the choices? Can you handle it?
[52:10.960 --> 52:14.400]  Or we let a bunch outside globalist scum come in and take it all over
[52:16.320 --> 52:18.320]  So Trump's calling Comey a liar
[52:18.320 --> 52:26.200]  He is a liar Senate Judiciary Committee probe into Obama Russian nuclear bribery case is criminal the hell boom
[52:26.960 --> 52:28.960]  Attorney that worked with Mueller
[52:29.440 --> 52:35.080]  Says Mueller head Russian bribery scandal from Congress must resign now was a corrupt attorney
[52:35.960 --> 52:40.120]  Sean Hay discusses uranium-1 scandal with Sarah Carter and John Solomon
[52:40.720 --> 52:44.280]  Trump hits back at McCain be careful at some point I fight back
[52:44.280 --> 52:48.520]  I think God's already fighting back against old John McCain
[52:49.040 --> 52:56.600]  That's all coming up. But right now. Let's go to this compilation of Hannity and the Judiciary Committee with the Attorney General saying Hillary is under criminal
[52:57.200 --> 52:59.360]  Investigation, let's go ahead and go to that clip
[53:00.320 --> 53:05.320]  Democrats are concerned that Russian Tampa Russia's tampered with our election results in 2016
[53:05.320 --> 53:13.320]  Well six years before that they tampered with our net our nuclear security the case proved that the nuclear Russia Russia's nuclear industry
[53:13.320 --> 53:19.440]  Had bribed their way and compromised the American trucking company that moved all of Russia's uranium in the United States
[53:19.560 --> 53:23.720]  That's a national security threat and for two years the Obama administration
[53:24.200 --> 53:30.800]  Hillary Clinton and everybody who's been quoted has said the Obama administration had no knowledge of a national security threat
[53:30.800 --> 53:35.120]  And that's why they didn't have any problem approving the uranium-1 deal
[53:35.120 --> 53:39.880]  Well, guess what tonight we have a real national security threat that was proven in real time in
[53:39.880 --> 53:44.040]  2009 and it's going to be interesting to see what Congress does tomorrow morning
[53:44.120 --> 53:49.640]  Chuck grassy has a hearing with Jeff Sessions on the seat, and I think you might see some interesting questions
[53:49.640 --> 53:54.800]  I want to ask a question that looks like history, but it was in the news recently
[53:55.520 --> 54:03.800]  Yesterday I believe according to government documents and recent news reports the Justice Department had an ongoing criminal and investigation for
[54:03.800 --> 54:10.880]  Library extortion and money laundering into officials for the russian company making the purchase of uranium-1
[54:11.360 --> 54:19.840]  That purchase was approved during the previous administration and resulted in the rations owning 20% of America's uranium mining capacity
[54:20.960 --> 54:29.880]  What are you doing to find out how the russian takeover of the American uranium was allowed to occur despite criminal
[54:29.880 --> 54:35.000]  Conduct by the russian company that the Obama administration approved to make the purchase
[54:35.560 --> 54:37.120]  Mr. Chairman
[54:37.120 --> 54:38.760]  we will
[54:38.760 --> 54:45.240]  Hear your concerns the Department of Justice will take such actions as is appropriate
[54:45.240 --> 54:52.000]  I know and I would would offer that some people have gone to jail in that transaction
[54:52.200 --> 54:55.880]  Already, but the article on talks about other issues
[54:55.880 --> 55:01.360]  So I without confirming or denying the existence of any particular investigation
[55:01.360 --> 55:04.760]  I would say I hear your concerns and they will be reviewed
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.000]  This is stunning that the Attorney General the United States Eric Holder
[55:09.440 --> 55:10.880]  He hid the information
[55:10.880 --> 55:15.720]  He knew about the bribery the kickbacks the extortion the money
[55:15.720 --> 55:21.040]  And he also knew as well as Hillary and had to sign off along with Hillary Clinton on the deal
[55:21.040 --> 55:28.160]  Even though that we know that they're trying to influence every aspect of our security and get control over America's uranium
[55:28.560 --> 55:30.960]  They still allowed the deal to go through
[55:31.400 --> 55:33.680]  Well, and these are many of the same players, right?
[55:33.680 --> 55:38.760]  You had Rod Rosenstein Rod Rosenstein then was head of this investigation when he was in Maryland
[55:38.920 --> 55:41.240]  Looking at the trucking company and remember that's right
[55:41.240 --> 55:47.560]  You have a trucking company that's moving American uranium that is involved in the one that puts Mueller into take down the president
[55:47.560 --> 55:53.440]  Tons of issues and they're moving a national security asset uranium and you have Andrew McCabe
[55:53.480 --> 55:59.040]  Who's the deputy director of the FBI now who was also charged with that investigation?
[55:59.040 --> 56:00.320]  These people are literally
[56:00.320 --> 56:02.320]  Is Mueller involved in this?
[56:02.680 --> 56:05.480]  Yes, and Mueller who was in charge then
[56:05.480 --> 56:06.880]  That is the investigator himself
[56:06.880 --> 56:14.320]  So we got Mueller having to investigate his boss now Rod Rosenstein who also and Andrew McCabe of the FBI and probably James Comey
[56:14.320 --> 56:15.720]  They all knew about this
[56:15.720 --> 56:18.400]  That's exactly what we're looking at pause for a moment
[56:19.280 --> 56:21.200]  Back up a few seconds. You notice what's happening?
[56:21.320 --> 56:24.160]  This is gonna hurt the country in many ways when this fall comes out
[56:24.160 --> 56:28.920]  So they held back and they're still trying to put Trump in his family in prison or overthrow him
[56:28.920 --> 56:34.040]  Send their Russian agents when there's no connections and you've got the Democrats weren't Russian agents
[56:34.040 --> 56:39.920]  They were just pimping us like America was a whore for two dollars out to whoever'd buy it. I
[56:39.920 --> 56:46.040]  Mean these are like pimps that got 50 John's out the door and you know the John's are putting cigarettes out on the woman's face
[56:46.040 --> 56:50.920]  Kind of you know last leg before they shoot the woman in the back of the head and throw her throw her in the river
[56:50.920 --> 56:56.640]  And that's how the globalists were treating America and now they're so angry and so upset that the sleeping giant
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.800]  Finally woke back up and threw these monsters off of us and we're stumbling out the hotel room door
[57:03.080 --> 57:08.640]  Hoping we can find our family somewhere down the road after we just got gang raped by 10,000 dudes and
[57:08.640 --> 57:12.240]  And seeing it and all of them are pissed because they they hate us
[57:12.240 --> 57:19.120]  They wanted to degrade us and bring us down just like they want to sexualize your children. They get off on it
[57:19.400 --> 57:26.080]  Now financially support us. We've got some of the biggest sales ever. They're absolutely about to end 50% off brain force
[57:26.200 --> 57:30.160]  We've got 50% off on some other products and through a pledge never done that before
[57:30.800 --> 57:37.840]  30% off some malvitality 10% additional off we sign up for auto ship free shipping at infowarstore.com on order three dollars or more
[57:37.840 --> 57:42.800]  But just commit to financially support us because the globalists absolutely hate it and we're gonna defeat them and crush them
[57:42.800 --> 57:44.800]  If you keep supporting us so fund us now
[57:47.200 --> 57:50.560]  Not a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it
[57:50.560 --> 57:57.080]  Why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[57:57.080 --> 58:02.520]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[58:02.520 --> 58:10.120]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host
[58:10.320 --> 58:12.320]  Mechanism right now with all the refugees
[58:13.040 --> 58:18.400]  Spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites
[58:18.400 --> 58:20.720]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it
[58:20.720 --> 58:22.080]  You have the neem in there
[58:22.080 --> 58:28.640]  You have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year
[58:28.640 --> 58:34.240]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars life

[59:53.220 --> 01:00:07.820]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.780]  Live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.380]  Broadcasting worldwide
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.380]  It's Alex Jones
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live hour number two
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:39.020]  I have one of the top coordinators to John Burt's decided joining us for a couple segments coming up
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.260]  In about 20 minutes to talk about the danger of a constitutional convention
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:49.380]  I know it sounds like a good way to get things done, but they could totally rewrite the whole Constitution during one
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.980]  They probably stage a big crisis in the middle of one
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:57.700]  So we're gonna look at that and how far we've come exposing globalism and then I
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:04.540]  Do intend to open the phones up and Gerald Salente joins us the last 30 minutes of the third hour and then Roger Stone
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:10.300]  Joins us talk about vindicated everything Roger Stone wrote down here
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:19.140]  A year and a half ago has now come out about the Russia situation and more weapons secrets transferred by Hillary
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.540]  Simply amazing and now
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:27.940]  We have congressional hearings with Jeff Sessions the Attorney General saying Hillary is under criminal investigation
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:32.500]  He says I will not get into things that are ongoing investigations to ask is she being investigating said well
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.100]  I won't get into ongoing investigations. What's that tell you and
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:40.060]  So we know that the whole uranium one thing is now coming out
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:46.500]  It was a total FBI report spiked by Mueller and spiked by Comey and
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.100]  They were you bag men delivering it getting money themselves
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.740]  literal bag men on you know tarmacs the case of Mueller and
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:02:00.420]  So that's why they're so frothing to stopping because they just committed gargantuan crimes
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:06.620]  And let foreign governments Pakistan run the DNC computers. I mean the list just goes on and on
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:12.900]  This is such over-the-top stuff. It's mind boggling. They got away with this much and coming up
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:18.260]  Trump tells McCain you listen here, buddy. I fight back and I'm getting ready to slap you upside your little head
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.820]  Politically, so we're gonna have that coming up as well
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.540]  And then some other incredible news
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:28.060]  I haven't gotten to yet dealing with the missing security guard that popped up on CNN that's best buddies with the Mandalay owners
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:33.900]  Turns out DeGeneres has invested in the MGM as well big time. That's coming up conflict of interest
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:39.500]  But here's more of the Hannity report last night. There was groundbreaking in many ways just for the fact that's on mainstream news
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:44.420]  And that we do have more intel it was much worse than we even thought but we were on target
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:49.020]  It was just the rat hole was deeper. We targeted the rat hole correctly, but only went down a few levels
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.780]  It got even worse as the basement fell into a whole nother sub level
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.380]  And who knows what's beneath that devil worshipping pedophiles, of course
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:00.420]  But that's what it's about. That's what the bottom of this globalist rainbow
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:06.460]  So it's not a leprechaun and it's not a pot of gold. It's pot belly pedophile devil worship nest. Let's go ahead and finish the club
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.460]  Would like to remind you that
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:11.740]  deputy attorney Rosenstein
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:17.660]  Directly supervised the criminal case when he was US attorney in Maryland
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:23.860]  I don't think it would be proper for him to supervise a review of his own conduct. Do you?
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:29.300]  It would be his decision. He's a man of integrity and ability if he feels that he has a
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.820]  Inability to proceed with any invest investigation
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.820]  It would be his responsibility
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:44.860]  To make that determination and should consult as I told you I would and as I have done with the senior ethics people at the department
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:51.860]  Reports suggest that the Clinton Foundation received millions of dollars from interested parties in the transaction
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:59.980]  Bill Clinton received 500,000 for a speech in Moscow June 2010 from the Russian government Align Bank
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:06.340]  I just a month as a speech Russia gate began the uranium acquisition process this fact
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:12.740]  pattern raises serious concerns about improper political influence on the process by
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.220]  the previous
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:21.700]  By by the Clintons during the Obama administration has the Justice Department fully investigated
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:30.140]  Whether the Russians compromised the Obama administration's decisions to smooth away for transactions and if not, why not?
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.060]  Mr. Chairman we're working hard to
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:39.980]  Maintain discipline in the department. It wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on any ongoing investigation
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:44.540]  There you go. Hillary's under criminal investigation. No other way to read that finally
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:50.540]  The Republic like the Phoenix from the ashes is rising. They want to fight
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.900]  They're scared now. They understand we want one
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:01.340]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by info wars life

[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:13.940]  But you want to fight you better believe you got one
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:19.860]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:26.780]  That little snippet was from a speech I gave in Dallas seven years ago
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.780]  I don't know how all this is gonna end
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.780]  Do you want to fight?
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.780]  You better believe you got one
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:42.740]  And now the globalists have got that fight they've been looking for and they're hitting the alarm buttons everywhere
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:49.220]  They're getting indicted. They're getting overthrown elections from Australia to Austria to the UK to the US
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:55.140]  To Brazil they are in full panic mode and I know I've told my crew
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:59.100]  This Russia thing is a pack of bull. We all know it is
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:03.980]  But let's stop covering it defended ourselves because I'm sick of hearing about it
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:09.460]  Let's fight the globalist on everything else. They're doing and let's talk about getting the economy going again and
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.380]  Jumpstarting the nation and moving forward, but now it's big news
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:20.220]  Because Mueller covered up the investigation. Comey did they lied to Congress. They transferred uranium
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.300]  Mueller was a bag man doing it. I
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:32.740]  Mean, it's just incredible that everything they've said Trump did they've done. I liken this to say a divorce proceeding
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.100]  Where
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:43.220]  Your husband is the judge and you're the wife and then the judge sits over the hearing of his own children and takes him away from the
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:44.420]  wife or
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:51.300]  Your wife is the family court judge and you're the husband and she takes him away from you and it'd be like Hitler
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:55.820]  sitting at Nuremberg in judgment in 1946 in
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.700]  Germany for the Nuremberg trials and
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:00.900]  Hitler's up there
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.900]  calling in Herman Guring and
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:04.700]  calling in
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:09.500]  All these other guys and saying how dare you do this for Hitler?
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:13.980]  And they're like mindfuhrer. You are the judge. I followed your orders mindfuhrer
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:20.180]  My leaping my leech in my my leader my gout lighter on my
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.180]  group and
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.220]  I mean, that's what's going on here. Oh
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:30.660]  You'd say Hitler cannot be the chief justice
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.100]  over the Nuremberg Tribunal
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.580]  Let's pull up some photos the Nuremberg
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.060]  Tribunal, please the Nuremberg court put those on screen for TV viewers
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:44.300]  Remember if you're a radio listener listening on over 200
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.020]  Of our wondrous affiliates across the United States
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:51.980]  Please support those local stations support their local sponsors become a sponsor
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.140]  Send them a weekly or monthly tithe in the information ward
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:05.020]  But whatever you do remember you can always tell your friends and family that may not be in your listening area about info wars.com
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.460]  forward slash show
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:14.780]  Or all the other platforms and podcasts and things where people can pick it up. It's the sharing of the live link
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:19.140]  It's the sharing of it on Facebook Twitter YouTube that gets around the censors
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:23.460]  And now has us reaching close to 60 million people a week
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:29.660]  Our peak was 87 million the week of the election our previous peak was 40 million or so 41 million now
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.020]  Our new peaks are 60 million
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:39.700]  Ladies and gentlemen that is exponential so it's got the enemy scared though and they're coming after us
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.460]  So that's all coming up
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.460]  also anti-trump dims
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:48.260]  exploit vets to attack Trump right after backing NFL's taken me and
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:55.060]  They've gone and dug up a few wives of troops that have died and a few congresswomen speaking for the wives
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:01.380]  Basically saying Trump hates the military totally fake contrived made-up situation
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:08.380]  Also, everybody always talks about the Kurds being the perfect angels in the Middle East and that's because they're a kind of in-between
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:10.780]  Group that hasn't been very expansionist
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.940]  but they have been working with
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:19.140]  Some of the other groups in the area to help push out Christians and take over their land as well
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:24.780]  So we should remember that there's an article on info wars.com how Kurds used ISIS and Antifa
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.500]  Well, they came and fought to expel Christians in the Middle East the Antifa came
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:33.820]  They're aligned with the Kurds and they enjoy the anti-Christian bent. There's even videos of it
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:36.940]  I mean, let me tell you folks left to see Christians as their enemies
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.540]  And even if a Muslim is gonna kill them of their gay, they don't care that's liberal and trendy
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:46.540]  But if you're just a mainline Christian, you've got to be killed
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.060]  It's just a it's a cult
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.460]  So that's coming up as well
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:58.860]  And then we've got this report coming up Vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned group to expose cover-up
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.860]  To the middle column on dredgerport.com
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:07.180]  That's why I like the drugs design better than info wars because he can have a hundred articles if he wants and stuff
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:12.380]  It's important from yesterday can still be on the site if it ties in with some new breaking news
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:19.860]  So you can add things that you know add to the research add to the information info wars bombshell story yesterday afternoon
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:23.580]  Scrolls off in a few hours and then you can't even find it on her site
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:29.980]  But it's a big article by Don Salazar in the middle column of drudge report calm
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.980]  We're gonna be getting into that as well
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:37.020]  But first here is a clip of Trump doing a radio interview
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:41.420]  Talking about the fact that you've McCain thinks
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:47.500]  That he's just gonna be able to keep coming after him and making stuff up and doing all this
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:55.180]  Well that Trump is going to hit back and the story again is up on info wars calm and news wars calm
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.940]  And is a really important story to Steve Watson article
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:06.300]  Trump hits back at McCain be careful at some point. I fight back. It won't be pretty. I think god already struck
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.100]  old mccainy
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.380]  Or karma did let's go ahead and play that clip of the president
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.580]  Do you think it'll be in good shape by the midterms?
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:20.620]  I think so. I think we'll have a lot done. We need some votes from some of the republicans that
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.460]  For some reason they weren't there on health care. They should have been we thought we had it
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:31.260]  But john mccain voted no, which was a shocker. We were taking shots at you again yesterday. Well, we it's a shocker and
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:39.180]  You know, you heard what he said yesterday senator mccain. Yeah. Well, I hear it and people have to be careful because at some point
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.460]  I fight back
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:46.060]  You know, I'm being very nice. I'm being very very nice, but at some point I fight back and it won't be pretty
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.300]  All right, mr.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:53.420]  Okay, so that is the chris plant show that that great interview with the president that is powerful
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:57.420]  Information right there and again the president has come out called
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:01.260]  Mueller a liar to his arrogant face. Mueller acts all powerful and
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:04.620]  Struts into congress like he's the president like he got elected
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:10.300]  When I'm not on the tarmac of secret Russia secret Russia meetings with the kgb fsb
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:16.940]  Transferring uranium for Hillary illegally which they admit when I'm not blocking criminal investigations of the fbi into her and bill
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:24.860]  Selling out our military secrets in one third of our uranium. I'm out trying to bring down the elected president defeat this country and calling the president a liar
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.620]  When he said that Obama didn't call many servicemen. I remember it in the news
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:37.580]  Four years ago three years ago that Obama wasn't visiting service people very often and that he wasn't calling all of them
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:42.460]  That was a thing that u.s. Presidents had always tried to do before
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:49.020]  You obviously can't in world war two or you get hundreds of thousands dead people, but uh, it's a serious situation
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:56.060]  They're a pac alliance scum and you just look at Mueller who covered up for the clinton crime syndicate and obama and the bushes and 9 11
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:00.700]  And the Saudi arabian connection of the 9 11 stand down that were totally vindicated on now
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.860]  With the congressional 28 pages. It is simply incredible
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:11.260]  And trump was against the iraq war they always lie and say he wasn't I've played the clips here
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:18.060]  But again, that's because cnn was and the fake left was and they know how pathetically discredited they are
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.740]  Here's an la times article. There's also one in the wall street journal
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:29.500]  George Soros has pumped 18 billion into open society foundations making it a philanthropic giant
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:37.420]  Yeah overthrowing the elected government of ukraine funding the era of spring that killed over a million people mainly christians gays women and priests
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:42.620]  And I mean it's incredible. What a wonderful guy. He gets it all from looting getting insider
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.980]  Trading knowledge the old nazi collaborator. Well

[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:31.820]  Well, you can't give up the stakes are too high the globalists literally want to impoverish us totally control us
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:37.420]  And have authoritarian power over humanity. That's what they're craving. They're mentally ill. They're sociopaths
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:43.980]  They're psychopaths and that and history shows that america is the experiment and the renaissance is the experiment
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:50.860]  Of trying to change that and turn that around but now the bbc and every other state-run media outlet in europe
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:56.300]  Is saying the west is inherently evil. We've got more clips of that coming up later
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.100]  uh vegas survivor who died suddenly has
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:07.420]  Had planned a group to expose the cover-up and was organizing the witnesses the fbi took all the footage told folks not to talk
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.980]  We know it is a coming Mueller
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:15.100]  pro-doge of the clinton's that isn't running the cover-up there in vegas
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:19.980]  But for this segment and part of the next i wanted to get robert brown on because i've seen his research and
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.780]  Seen some of the speeches he's given
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:27.820]  He is a coordinator and regional field director for the john bursa society covering montana while enuming
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:31.740]  North dakota and south dakota. He's best known for his lectures on the constitution
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:36.540]  He's produced six of the lectures on dvd series knows the constitution is the solution
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:42.780]  Which is gaining popularity nationwide. He and his family reside in billings montana and uh, they're they're battling to
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.740]  Wake folks up and defend the republic, but i wanted to get him on
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.140]  to just to
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:54.220]  In general talk about his view of the trump revolution other populist constitutional revolutions happening
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:22:01.100]  And and and what he is concerned might derail it or how they might sucker punches because i've had i've seen a lot of people
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:03.900]  That i respect and like pushing a constitutional convention
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.460]  So we should talk about what those are briefly?
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:14.140]  As a solution to fully retake the country well, we're already beginning to do it at the state level and culturally and at the federal level
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:17.660]  We have the trifecta now as soon as we dig out the republican establishment
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:23.900]  So i tend to lean his direction that a constitutional convention is one of the only things the globalist could use
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:28.140]  To try to overturn the constitution in the middle of rights, but let's get his
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.140]  Take on that right now robert brown jbs.org
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.620]  Uh, what is your expert analysis on this?
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:39.500]  My concern here is that in today's political environment
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:44.940]  This would be the exactly wrong thing to be doing to be having a article five constitutional convention
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:48.060]  I look back to the expertise of james madison
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.460]  where in his day
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:56.060]  He was very concerned about a growing movement in his time to have a constitutional convention to make changes to the new
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.460]  Constitution they just established
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:04.540]  And his main concerns he pointed to was the present temper of america and the present ferment of parties
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:10.140]  There was such political discord at the time. He thought that opening up the constitution for another convention
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:12.540]  would just lead to chaos
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:15.500]  And I have to ask are we in any better circumstance today?
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:19.420]  Do we have better political harmony or are we in political discord again?
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.900]  I think the answer on that one's quite clear
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:26.220]  It would be absolute chaos. Of course all the lobbyists would be vying for position on
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.660]  Getting their ideas into the new changes of the constitution
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.740]  So in today's political environment, this is a crazy idea
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:40.860]  In addition to that, I think justice galia said it best when he said this is not a good century to write a constitution
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:45.340]  And I would back that up with my own experience that as I've traveled around the country
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:53.340]  Speaking on the constitution. I find most people even those that are politically active are pretty ignorant of what the constitution already says
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.380]  And so the types of amendments they tend to come up with
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:00.620]  Tend to do more damage than good because they are not sure of the constitution
[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:02.060]  They're cutting out that's right. It was written by
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:06.540]  Real by geniuses marveled at around the world by other statesmen and researchers could really
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:14.380]  Bind down corruption and gangs and monopolies and try to create a system a platform to empower humanity
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:15.980]  Didn't mean they were perfect in their time
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:22.780]  But the idea is the bane of globalists the bane of tyrants and it's why we see globalist organizations for decades
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:28.300]  Pushing a con con and as you said you see their whole plan to destabilize the country
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:35.340]  They would take a con con as the time to launch their their bolstering style revolution that they're already trying to push right now
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.980]  Absolutely whereas those of us who value liberty
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:45.580]  We don't have any need for any changes to the constitution simply enforcing what it already says
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.060]  would make massive
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.660]  inroads towards
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:55.020]  Stabilizing our country creating financial process. It's like a submarine. It's not broken if the doors are open
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:57.580]  You go under water and it floods. You got to close the doors
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.260]  Yeah, precisely precisely
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:08.700]  And so as I look at things here one of the things the founding fathers did point to is in times where the constitution is just being ignored
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:13.260]  They never pointed to using article five to make changes to the constitution
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.620]  What they always pointed to was constitutional enforcement
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:21.660]  As a classic example of this the alien and sedition acts of 1798
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:29.900]  Which were clear violations of among other things our freedom of speech. It made it illegal to speak against the actions of the president or congress
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:35.580]  Madison and jefferson recognizing this was a great encroachment against the clear meaning of the constitution
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.300]  Didn't say we need to change the constitution
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:44.940]  They said we need to enforce the constitution. They came up with the the uh, kentucky and virginia resolution
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:50.140]  That's right. You don't need a new constitution just because they're ignoring the old one. They're going to ignore the new one
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.660]  Precisely I compare this often to
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:26:00.060]  Imagine having a sporting game where none of the refs have ever read the rules and have very little idea of how the game's supposed to be played
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:04.460]  And so most of the players have never bothered reading the rules either. They know they don't need to follow
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.460]  So they say let's write new rules
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:09.580]  Right. Oh, let's write new rules. We're not using the ones we already have
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:12.140]  That's what's going on with the people in congress
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:17.660]  The people are supposed to be as hamilton put it the natural guardians of the constitution
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:23.340]  We're the ones that are ultimately the final rep on whether the constitution is being followed or not
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.740]  And yet none of us know what it says
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:32.140]  Nobody generally has much idea of the constitution. I often run constitution quizzes around the country
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:35.820]  And you're hard to find anyone that can even get a passing grade on it
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:38.300]  Because we're ignorant of the constitution
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.900]  And as long as we don't know the rules, they don't have to follow them exactly
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:45.980]  Let me ask you this question until recently. You usually didn't hear conservatives push
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:47.900]  concons
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.460]  Now I'm I'm hearing more and more from fox news
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:55.180]  You know, I've had guests on heard their perspective on how it's needed and I've overall disagreed with them
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.420]  I mean, I could see how there was a total awakening
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:01.580]  You know, we could you know, perhaps have a few new things for things that are more modern
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:07.580]  But don't change anything that's old because it's worked so well, but why suddenly are more and more conservatives pushing it?
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:13.900]  Unfortunately, I think a lot of them are getting desperate and see this as a great idea
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.620]  It's being portrayed in ways that I don't think are realistic though
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:23.020]  If you were to honestly pull up the anchor of our constitution right now and drift to the center of political thought
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:27.180]  Would that move us closer to the mindset of madison or marx?
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.300]  Versus back in 1787 when it was written
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:36.300]  Obviously our nation has moved far in the wrong direction and it's a very dangerous political environment
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:38.300]  We don't understand the history
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:43.260]  Like the founding fathers did to create the constitution as they did and look
[01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.060]  Confederate general stuff. I'm like
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:49.420]  Charles Barkley and others I mean who even pays attention to that
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.780]  But it's being brought up to tear that down and then say oh the american flag flew over slavery
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.380]  Get rid of it get rid of the constitution and now just a few years later
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:04.460]  What we predict is true the left is saying the country's bad the bill of rights is bad the constitution's bad in england
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.140]  They're saying get rid of the whole government
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:12.620]  It's racist too because it actually is protecting the people and has those those rights enshrined that that weren't given by government
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.020]  But we're only pointed out by the constitutions
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:21.340]  This is a direct globalist war on the nation state to replace it with the un system where you have absolutely no rights
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:28.140]  Absolutely, you know one thing I often look at here is the left has a tremendous amount to gain
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:33.500]  By making changes to the constitution whereas on the right those of us that value limited government
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:40.380]  We couldn't do better than the provisions that are currently in the constitution take for example to push for a balanced budget amendment
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:46.300]  Tell us about that robert brown of the jbs one of their top constitutional educators out there
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:52.940]  Uh over four state area. We're going to come back and get his his take on this and other angles and other attack plans of a con con

[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:14.700]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:22.060]  They had drums of their own air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war

[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:55.340]  I got several other mainstream publications admitting that globalism is in trouble
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.900]  It's an unelected authoritarian system
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:04.380]  It better be in trouble and vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned group to expose cover-up
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:10.700]  She was a young 29 year old 28 year old woman. This is crazy. That's coming up, but robert brown
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:14.860]  Is a coordinator of the regional field director of the john bert society
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:16.860]  Uh covering four states who?
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:24.700]  Again is one of the first organizations to expose the globalist conspiracy back in the 1950s when we discovered the cia
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:32.700]  Uh had actually put malice tongue into power. That's how the john bert society started people are like what and now it's all been proven
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:40.460]  It's all been declassified. Uh, it's just crazy. So he's a historian on this jbs.org getting in the dangers of con con finish up
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:45.340]  Uh with the j with the dangers of the con con and then other threats you see
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:52.300]  If this was a ball game where you'd see team america team republic versus team soros team globalist and uh
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.900]  Where in history you think we are right now in your view of trump?
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.460]  Very good questions where we left off first of all was my
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:05.660]  Explanation that really the left has a tremendous amount to gain for making changes to the constitution
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:09.740]  Whereas those of us that believe in limited government couldn't do better than
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:11.740]  the enumeration of powers for example
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:15.260]  On the one hand we have people pushing for a balanced budget amendment
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:18.780]  Which would only say congress can't spend more than they take in
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:24.540]  Instead of that if we were to get back to congress only spending money on the enumeration of powers
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:32.220]  You would see a reduction of over 80 of federal spending. You'd see a surplus annually of over two trillion dollars
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:39.180]  So much better and it would also rain the federal government back to what they're actually supposed to be doing within their jurisdiction
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:45.260]  So it doesn't have any comparison here what they're trying to accomplish through a convention versus what the constitution already says
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.980]  but the other thing I want to really focus on is
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:51.820]  As constitutionalists originalists conservatives
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:59.420]  We really have two angles of attack to get back to the constitution and both of them begin with we the people
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:05.580]  We need to understand the constitution and demand adherence to it and as more and more of us do that
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:11.660]  We have two angles where we can attack big government and rain it back in the first one is state legislatures
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:16.380]  You've heard many times of the concept of state nullification, which is exactly what Madison
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:20.300]  And jefferson turned to with the alien and sedition acts
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:24.060]  They said the states need to refuse to comply with this in fact
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:30.140]  Hamilton and federalist 16 says if the cooperation of state legislatures is not necessary
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:32.700]  To give effect to a measure of the union
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:40.140]  They have only not to act or act evasively and the measures to feed it and that accounts for a majority of federal programs
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:42.460]  They require the states to help implement them
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:48.380]  So if the states are concerned of the federal government overstepping their bounds stop helping them that's the first step
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.860]  But in addition to that angle of attack working through the states and nullification
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:57.820]  The other is this people directly holding their members of congress accountable
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:02.220]  I cover this in a video that can be found on youtube called the power of 500
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:10.540]  Where we found that a team of about 500 people in a congressional district is enough political sway that when they're working coordinated
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:13.900]  In holding their elected officials accountable to the constitution
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:15.740]  It has a tremendous effect on them
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.340]  We did that with my own congressman montana a few years ago within a few months
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:24.300]  He began following the constitution very well because he felt tremendous pressure from the people
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:31.100]  So these are the most powerful tools we have number one the state legislatures number two the people themselves in fact
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:36.540]  Madison referred to the people themselves as the ultimate redress of constitutional violations
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:43.040]  These are where we really need to be focusing and it starts with the people understanding the constitution
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:46.300]  Which is why as you mentioned in my introduction there
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:51.660]  We produced a this video series the constitution is the solution to help people become familiar with
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.860]  the important points of the constitution that they need to know
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.300]  To rein the federal government back into their jurisdiction
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:02.700]  If the federal government were following the constitution the enumerated powers
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:08.620]  They wouldn't be involved in most of what they are doing and most of the areas where we feel oppression coming from them
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:15.020]  That's ultimately the real solution. I see we're in that transition period where if we work enough
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:18.540]  To help educate enough people we can turn things in the right direction
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.780]  but without that
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:26.780]  The statement from thomas jefferson comes to mind if a nation expects to be ignorant and free
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:30.780]  It expects what never was never will be there's nothing we can do
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:34.300]  To get our nation back on track without the american people
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:38.380]  Understanding these principles of liberty and the constitution and that was my next question
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:44.380]  Two or three minutes ago listening to you the democrats and the globalists admit they want to dumb down population
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:47.500]  They write white papers two plus two equals five common core
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:53.740]  They know they can't beat free market. They know they can't beat the constitution. They know they can't beat the weapon
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.380]  Of the renaissance the flower
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.620]  Uh of 1798
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:03.180]  They know and so they just ruthlessly want to create dependency
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:11.420]  And ignorance so you're right you educate the people and in the basics of liberty and freedom and history to paraphrase jefferson and
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.700]  Uh tyrants will vanish like phantoms at dawn
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.500]  the problem is
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.100]  That they know we're winning now
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:24.060]  I mean you go back to the 1950s when the john birch society was founded by mainly patriots and government and others
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:29.260]  Were actually aware of the plan uh to turn us into a communist slash socialist program
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:34.860]  Imagine how small that started and now in 2017. We're beginning to get the upper hand
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:42.460]  But you know the winds could change very quickly the enemy could pull off some really dirty tricks. They've already been trying it
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:45.580]  We're forcing them to accelerate their authoritarian plan
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:51.100]  So I see a major violent collision not by us, but by them in the near future
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:54.780]  Soros was giving 500 million a year to try to bring down the u.s
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:40:00.060]  Now he just put 18 billion in his people literally are actively trying to destroy me
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.900]  um
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:08.620]  And everybody else. I mean these are monstrous people. So just getting off the constitution and taking off your professor hat
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:14.380]  Looking at trump. Why do they hate him so much? I know he's more of a pragmatist. He's just not out to get america
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:20.780]  He believes in some basic americana that shows you how bad hillary would have been that they're just horrified of trump
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.980]  Where do you see that battle going in the few minutes we have left?
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:31.820]  Speaking of george soros, for example, we see george soros funded organizations on both sides of this battle on changing the constitution
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:35.660]  We see some of them saying no, we do not want to have an article by convention
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:38.620]  We see others that are saying yes, we do like wolf pack
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:44.940]  He's playing in funding both sides of this battle. That says something and I think you can do some interesting analysis on what he might be able
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:48.780]  to gain from that funding both sides of the battle, but ultimately
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.980]  This is the the real issue. We the people
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:55.820]  Are the greatest power in this country and as you're saying we're starting to see an awakening
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:01.740]  This has got them terrified if the american people enough of us wake up their game is over
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:08.380]  And that is really our mission our mission is yours as well as the john birch society to wake people up to what is really going on
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.940]  To have enough people standing up to what's going on
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:16.300]  Otherwise and this is really a race to the finish if we can wake up enough people in time
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:20.460]  We win if not, they win. That's ultimately what it comes down to
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:22.460]  You're absolutely right and
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:30.220]  Look hillary had two billion dollars trump had four hundred million. He beat her. We have a few million dollars. They have 18 billion, but
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:34.460]  Force feeding us propaganda is backfiring now
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:40.940]  And so just because soros is all in throwing a fit with all his stolen money from every scam you can imagine
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:46.220]  Currency speculation bringing countries down funding revolutions against elected governments. I mean
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:49.660]  They've got indictments out for him in multiple nations
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:55.820]  So don't be intimidated folks. This is a desperation move by this monster and his cohorts
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:01.660]  We are winning because we're promoting freedom and when you take action and when you speak out and when you get involved
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:06.940]  Like robert brown's doing nothing on earth can stop us and most importantly pray to god
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:13.100]  For providence. We will defeat this old wicked nazi collaborator. We will defeat the globalist
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:19.180]  Their system once identified will never flourish. It's an authoritarian planetary plan. They were so delusional
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:27.020]  They thought we were so dumb that no one would ever study the plan and now the work of the john burt society has gone from one person
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.140]  to
[01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:31.660]  Planetary awakening to the globalist system and that's why they're a very
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:39.100]  Small but focused organization and that's why I always support the work. They've done robert brown. Great job. Thank you so much
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:40.620]  God bless you

[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:23.340]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:33.340]  Vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned group to expose cover-up. We're gonna be getting to that and more
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:38.620]  Jaguars president apologizes for team kneeling during national anthem in london
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:46.140]  And meanwhile mark faber a super high-level economist one of the smartest guys out there one of the best records of predicting things
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:50.060]  There was all this criticism of western europe and saying whites are inherently bad
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:56.060]  And he just basically said thank god, you know, the united states got settled by europeans because
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.580]  There's a civilization here and he got fired from his company
[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.700]  Now look
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:05.980]  I wouldn't say something like that because history is a lot more complex than that
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:08.700]  But the truth is everybody was barbarous
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:17.980]  But then you've got the bbc and two pieces i played just yesterday on the same show saying whites are inherently evil and bad
[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:22.220]  I mean it's pure nazi ideology but flipped around
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:26.060]  So that's coming up
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.300]  because
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:32.540]  If you want to see what it was really like because I read a lot of history books were written about people that were there
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:38.540]  French trappers british trapper people with educations that wrote the first in the camps go watch the movie rather than
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:41.260]  That's what it was like
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:45.420]  The native americans would say if you don't join us to help kill the other group
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:49.500]  We're gonna kill you and i'm not saying they were bad. That's just how the whites acted
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:55.900]  The whites 2000 years ago in britain were human sacrificing people
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:03.900]  2000 years ago the native americans in mexico were doing it same stuff same behavior. They said bigger pyramids in mexico
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.900]  What's mexico today, I mean
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:12.060]  But there's something different after the dark ages
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:15.500]  Where we were burning people that knew about herbs or science
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:19.660]  The renaissance came 550 years ago
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:24.220]  So the white man was just as barbarous and backwards as anybody else
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:27.980]  Except the chinese were more advanced. They were very barbarous though in the japanese
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:33.580]  But something happened it was the christian ethos met liberty and
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:36.700]  sort of valuing human life and it took a process
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:43.660]  Of hundreds of years to start achieving what the west has done the west trailblazed human liberty
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:48.860]  So yes, I say thank god for the renaissance that took root in europe
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:52.620]  And I don't think phaber put the historical
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:56.620]  Accuracy on it
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:50:04.140]  I'd say he spun it into a more reactionary vein instead of just directly looking at history and what really happened
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:08.860]  But there is a war on history going on right now. I mean it's like
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:17.260]  The city of z i've actually read mainline history books about what really went on at that time none of it's true
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:21.820]  england didn't believe that there was ancient pyramids in the americas
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:26.060]  They'd already found him hundreds of 300 years before 400 years before
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:31.820]  The whole movie's like those savages can't build anything. They're backward scum
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:35.740]  Just to make it's just and none of it's even historically true
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:43.260]  And then one of the famous explorers is a coward and all this other stuff. It's all sjw made up stuff
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:45.260]  It's just phony is the justice league
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:53.500]  I mean you can't even watch historical movies now and not be bombarded with this weird white knight
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:56.220]  Virtue signaling crap
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:51:03.820]  So you're gonna get phaber on the other side saying well, I'm not against whites. Thank god they settled america
[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:06.860]  I mean if whites are so bad
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:14.060]  Why is everybody trying to get into the countries that whites built people say other people built those absolutely every group exploits other groups
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:19.660]  No one ever denied that the west for 550 years has been trying to stop it
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:25.740]  Go to another country see how barbarous they are. That's all I'm saying
[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:31.820]  See I feel so good about myself. I don't need to look down on other people. So I feel powerful
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:41.260]  But I see racism and cultural warfare from the globalist left these ruthless corporations playing us all off against each other
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:46.380]  That's what the cia does with anthropologists and sociologists is go in and study groups
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:54.140]  That's where they send in first to a country. They're going to take over for decades to learn everything and to have their professors write books
[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:57.340]  scholarly tomes
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:51:59.900]  on the infrastructure of the area
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:05.500]  And the cultural systems to divide and conquer them later and I'm going to get more into that in a moment
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:12.540]  America and our republic is under attack
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:17.980]  Because the globalists know that a free open society the idea of America
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:24.220]  Is absolutely at loggerheads with the globalist system. They're trying to build
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:31.660]  That's scientifically directed a technocracy totally authoritarian that is completely cold-blooded
[01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:34.780]  absolutely anti-loving
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:42.780]  Altruistic and committed to total complete engineering of the human species
[01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:50.140]  And mass culling of 90 of the world population. That's what ted turner. That's what bill clinton. That's what bill gates
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:54.780]  That's what george soros. That's what all of these groups are pushing
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:59.340]  That is their set destiny and overarching plan
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:02.780]  and now we have george soros
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:09.340]  coming out who normally gives a couple billion dollars a year globally to overthrow free and open societies
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:17.180]  And cause culture wars and 500 million a year on average to try to destabilize the us and cause race and cultural war
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:24.460]  He has now bellied up to the bar and put 18 billion dollars of his stolen loot
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:27.740]  Into the kitty
[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:29.740]  That's all in
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:31.740]  I
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:37.260]  That is completely and totally all in
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:43.420]  To try to overthrow the americana 2.0 rising from the ashes
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:46.940]  1776 part 2 that we're witnessing
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:51.580]  Trump's not perfect, but he believes in the republic. He believes in the free market
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:55.580]  He believes in empowering the average person and having a true
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:54:03.420]  competition based system and because of that the globalists had already thought they had full control of america and then the world
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:09.980]  Are in total panic mode in an existential battle seeing their entire authoritarian world government
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:18.780]  crumble and collapse in front of them and so george soros funds media matters cnn msnbc all these legal groups
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:21.820]  and other operations that are
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:27.260]  Uh openly suing trump thousands of times setting up and suing us as well
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:35.500]  Trying to sabotage our suppliers trying to shut down our support base trying to get us kicked off radio and tv
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:40.300]  Trying to have us criminally investigated trying to have us shut down
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:43.020]  But I have the republic behind me
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:46.540]  And common sense and awake population to defend
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:54.140]  Against you. I'm not those poor sad hard work in eastern european peasants that you helped round up for four years
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:58.940]  When you sent them to death camps soros and you thought you could bring down america
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:01.340]  You're gonna find out we're not gonna go so easy
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:05.260]  So he's 18 billion dollars in to this fight right now
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.900]  And he thinks he's gonna break your will
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:13.660]  But here's the good news hillary had almost three billion dollars trump had about 400 500 million
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:19.020]  But he had the people and so he won and so this force feeding of his culture war
[01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:22.220]  And trying to buy off groups. He isn't gonna help him
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:27.420]  It's gonna blow up in his face because no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:31.500]  And he made pay off anderson cooper to say he wasn't a nazi collaborator
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:37.580]  But we've got him on tv saying he was a nazi collaborator. So i'm asking listeners and viewers of this transmission
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:43.420]  Now more than ever to understand when you spread the articles when you spread the videos when you spread the live
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:50.300]  Feeds at info wars.com forward slash show or facebook google twitter or other platforms or you spread the podcast
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:53.020]  Or you spread other systems
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:58.060]  It is funding a revolution globally against these technocrats
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:05.980]  And when you buy the products at infowar store.com you are involved in a revolutionary act against these globalists because pennies
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:09.420]  Against their thousands of dollars and millions
[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:15.660]  Against their billions is all ready defeating them and will defeat them the fact that he's gonna have to put in
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:21.580]  Hundreds of times a year what he put in previously of his stolen loot just kills him
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:25.420]  So i'm asking you as the enemy ups their power against us
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:30.140]  As the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will lift up a standard against it
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:31.900]  And info wars is imperfect
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:37.980]  But we are seen by the enemy as the standard as one of the main standard bearer operations against them
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:43.820]  And that's why we're under attack. So rally around the flag my friends and financially support us today

[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:50.380]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:56.140]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:58:02.380]  That's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the usa
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:09.340]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war
[01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:11.500]  It is a classical 360 win
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:15.100]  This is the formula that i personally have been taking for over a year
[01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:21.100]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get
[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:26.060]  You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world

[01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:54.940]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:59:00.300]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:03.180]  But right now we're dealing with massive
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:10.060]  Parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees

[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:27.980]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today

[02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:48.460]  It's failing. They're now trying to launch one in England saying that their government and their history is evil
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:54.300]  They are trying to cover up the mass shooting that happened two and a half weeks ago. That's fully imploding
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:57.980]  Uh, just everything the globalists do turns into pure garbage now
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:01.100]  and on top of that
[02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:05.260]  Now trump has come out called Mueller a liar. Mueller was the backman for uranium
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:10.700]  Mueller killed criminal investigations at the fbi into hillary not just transferring uranium
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:15.980]  But also weapons components when she was the head of the state department. I mean, we've already known this but to see everything
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:17.980]  We broke a year ago
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:22.300]  But even more info come out and to see the day after hannity covered it
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:27.740]  Senator grassley talking about it and sessions saying that yes, there is a criminal investigation of hillary
[02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:30.940]  Wow how the worm has turned
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:35.740]  Right down the few minutes we have left in this short segment. Let's go ahead and go to this article
[02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:39.100]  Vegas survivor. This is an info wars.com article
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:41.500]  Vegas survivor who died suddenly
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:44.380]  had planned
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:51.500]  An organization to expose the cover-up. She was going to create an organization of survivors
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:54.460]  who were going
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:02:00.140]  To expose what they really saw well the video survives the videos the fbi didn't get and then a race off people's phones
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:02.700]  then you've got the
[02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:08.220]  Timeline changing five or six times you've got video of shooters down the road and eyewitnesses to it
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:11.660]  And all the military experts including military experts
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:14.540]  that testify in court

[02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:23.180]  Inside and out we first broke that
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:25.980]  clearly shooters other areas
[02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:29.500]  Not just at mandalay, but at other casinos
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:36.540]  A woman who died days after surviving the ill-fated october first country music festival in las vegas. She lived there perfect them to get to her
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:41.900]  Wanted to organize a group a survivors group in order to flush out the strange event
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:46.140]  Who they didn't want that because they had credibility and they had standing in court
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:54.460]  Facebook conversations reveal and you've got screenshots of all of them on info wars.com by the way the fbi erased those as well
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:56.140]  kimberley
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:03:01.180]  Shomal 28 died suddenly on october night at her apple valley california residents
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:06.780]  She also lived in vegas part of the time five days after posting her version of events to facebook
[02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:15.340]  The day's following the massacre fringe reached out to shomal over october fourth post in which she describes someone setting off firecrackers near the venue
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:18.380]  And detailed being chased by numerous people
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:22.700]  concluding at one point there was more than one gun firing hundred percent
[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:28.140]  More than one and of course we had witnesses saying they were told to get out
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:33.340]  You're going to be dead in 45 minutes then 45 minutes later the shooting starts and people inside mandalay
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:37.100]  Saying that there had been people shooting inside that later came out too
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:44.220]  Everything the people told us everything our fbi sources told us is coming true. You've got a protégé of muhler
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:49.260]  Who was then appointed to head up vegas by comey right before he left
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:53.900]  And we've got federal sources saying this guy is as bad as the day is long
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:59.900]  One longtime friend of shomal's who asked to remain anonymous provided info wars screenshots
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:02.620]  Have a conversation he'd have with her in which she
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:06.780]  Indicated planning to organize group of survivors ordered to piece together things
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:10.300]  That's info wars.com adan salazar article
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:15.340]  Breaking it all down you can read her last photos and last words
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:18.300]  She wanted you to investigate. Will you investigate?
[02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:24.300]  You can share my comment for sure she wanted to say to everybody they wanted to organize a group to find out the truth
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:26.540]  Others have been
[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:28.540]  Dying suddenly you weren't even shot as well
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:34.060]  So they were planning to blame this on the second amendment all our intel says it's an isis attack
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:38.300]  We've got british intelligence head coming out and saying they're seeing exponential islamic attacks
[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:43.580]  Well, yeah, you bring in record numbers of unvetted military aged men who invaded syria into your countries
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:47.180]  You're gonna get attacked the government's answer is of course take all of our rights
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:52.700]  That makes it a false flag. They brought in the groups. They knew what attack gerald salente the trends forecasters straight ahead
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:05:01.900]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product brain force

[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:04.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:10.620]  It's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:24.140]  I'll tell you this everything the globalist media pushes is more and more blowing up in their face
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:27.580]  trendsresearch.com best-selling author researcher
[02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:34.860]  Trends forecaster Gerald Salente joins us for the hour. I'm not going to go into his whole bio or how he's
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:37.180]  Basically been in all the media you can imagine
[02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:42.060]  Uh, the the bottom line is I want to get his world view about where we are historically
[02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:47.580]  I remember what was it five years ago or so? They were saying the economy was dead
[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:49.820]  America was over
[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:51.820]  Everything was done for
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:55.980]  And he said well, I'm going to double down and believe in americana. I'm going to go buy
[02:06:55.980 --> 02:07:03.020]  At a strategic point the four corners in kinks in new york where the revolution first got hatched even before
[02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:08.780]  Uh, what we saw happened at the green dragon in uh, or what we saw there, uh in
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:11.900]  Philadelphia at the constitution hall
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:16.860]  And so he doubled down. He said down the road. You know, who knows what with the stock market
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:23.100]  But he said I believe in a reassurgence of americana and quality and main street and people waking up
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:28.700]  And so now I wouldn't say we're winning but we're in the thick of the fight and all over the world from austria
[02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:35.020]  To brazil to australia to the uk to here to catalonia people are fighting back for independence
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:39.900]  Doesn't mean they're always winning but every time they fight back they get stronger each time is trump perfect
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:44.300]  No, but you know a man by his enemies the globalist hated because he's trying to be president
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:51.500]  He doesn't want one side of deals that screw america over and just the idea of that that america wouldn't have the highest corporate tax in the world
[02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:56.460]  By design to ship our jobs in china that we wouldn't ban coal when everybody else has it
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:08:00.380]  That we wouldn't be involved in economic sabotage of our own nation
[02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:03.820]  As the globalists sell out america the world for their own power
[02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:11.100]  That's why the enemies of the country hate trump so much and it's why he's so loathed by ignorant people and by parasites
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:14.460]  That I have to defend him even more because in this historic time
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:21.100]  I want to be up there signing my john handcock my alexander jones on the declaration of independence
[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:29.820]  The biggest and the boldest because make no mistake. We are risking our lives our sacred honor our treasure our families in this great endeavor and
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:31.820]  I just want to beat the globalist
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:35.340]  But if we're successful when the next history transmissions are written
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:39.340]  And transmitted I guess directly into our brains on distant star systems
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:46.540]  Uh, your progeny my progeny will look back on this time as the deciding crossroads gerald solente great to have you here
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:52.380]  Thank you. It's always great being on with you. Um, I'd like to pick up what you're saying about globalism
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:57.980]  And the dangers of it and how it is really going in reverse in a lot of places
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:05.660]  Except here in in the united states. You mentioned what's going on in austria. They just had an election last week and the
[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:10.620]  Freedom party came out of nowhere and and now they're somewhere
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:18.940]  You saw what happened in germany a couple of weeks ago with angela merkel getting trounced by the afd the alternative for deutschland
[02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:22.460]  You see this secessionist movement in california
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:28.060]  And whether you like him or not not our kind of guy because he's a Rothschild boy
[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:30.700]  Macron over in france a new party
[02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:35.980]  The point that i'm making is that they're very fearful and they're saying it
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:43.580]  Here's a quote from wolfgang schwaveler who was the former german finance minister
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:51.420]  Until merkel just got trounced. Here's what he warned the people about. I want everyone to listen very carefully
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:57.820]  There's no chance germany will ever relapse
[02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:00.940]  internationalism
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:07.500]  The afd's voters. That's the alternative for deutschland voters were dissatisfied
[02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:12.620]  Felt excluded were angry about perceived
[02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:18.380]  Injustice and worried about how the world was changing
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:23.340]  I want to comment on this because his words are very important
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:33.500]  How dare we should relapse internationalism? How dare those germans want to hang on to their ethnicity?
[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:41.500]  Their culture and their heritage. How dare the italians the french
[02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:46.700]  The americans or any other culture
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:54.940]  Wants to hang on to what made them who they are. How dare they respect their ancestors?
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:11:01.500]  And the cultural greatness that made them who they are when they should become globalized
[02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:06.140]  This is the arrogance the words that are being spoken
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:10.620]  But being ignored and you listen to his words again
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:16.380]  Devoters were dissatisfied felt excluded and angry
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:23.580]  Felt excluded a wolf gang. Could you add this up? You were a finance minister
[02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:29.980]  You could probably do a little bit of addition. You got eight people that have more money
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:35.980]  Than half the world's population according to oxfam felt excluded
[02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:43.500]  We're all getting screwed by the multinationals wolf gang who you suck up to and who they pay you off to
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:49.500]  Like the clinton's and all the rest. I want you to get back on this amazing break now. But let me just add to what you're saying
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:54.380]  It's not like it's some natural migration of people and cultures coming together or something
[02:11:54.620 --> 02:12:01.900]  It's global mega corporations that are tax exempt above the law saying we're bringing in groups to politically control you
[02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:09.740]  We're going to raise your taxes exempt ourselves at the uu level from the very taxes and then dictate to you
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:15.740]  How you're going to live your life? We're going to bring in 10 million people 80 percent of which are military age men
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:20.380]  And then tell german women don't wear skirts and ban from switzerland
[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:30.460]  To germany you name it. They're having uh, uh, sweden having to ban outdoor beer drinking and october fest because the radical muslims will kill you
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:33.500]  I mean imagine saying submit to an outside
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:35.820]  anti-liberal ideology
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:41.100]  Allied with a bunch of megabanks with george soros funding it breathing down your neck
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:49.180]  In some mass cuckolding of europe. I mean, it's just crazy the arrogance of outside megabanks coming in
[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:52.060]  Saying we're going to totally dominate you
[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:56.620]  It is and that's what's going on and look what's going on you're talking about taxes
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:13:02.940]  Look at this bs with amazon. They're they're bragging over here in jersey that they're going to give them
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:07.020]  You know all this dough as tax breaks. What is this guy worth?
[02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:13.500]  You know 86 billion dollars and we got to give amazon tax breaks. Nobody gives me tax breaks
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:18.460]  Oh, you're going to create jobs. Yeah, I got a great job for you go to college
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:21.180]  get a degree in shipping
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:26.700]  And packaging and you could get a job at amazon and be in debt 40 000
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:31.580]  But then amazon admits that they've got robots that are coming in the next few years to replace you
[02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:37.820]  And apple's got the worst slave factories with suicide nets 17 hour work days where they force drug and abort babies
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:41.740]  But it's okay because they're liberal and they gave money to black lives matter
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:46.540]  And then you got a a jerk like christie bragging
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:51.980]  That they're giving them all these tax breaks let any other state beat it. I got one for you
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:58.460]  How about fox con the one over there in wisconsin from taiwan that makes apple computers
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:05.820]  They're going to give them something like, you know, uh, a three billion dollar tax break something ridiculous
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:09.500]  Hold on jerry. We got to go to break, but you're absolutely right and let's not forget
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:14.140]  Bezos gets a dollar 48 us taxpayer subsidy on all the packages
[02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:19.180]  He ships a little thing. He got congress to do so folks again when you order from amazon
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:22.380]  You're literally cutting your own throat. They're even going to bank. We're up walmart
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:29.260]  We're going out to break with zero salinity on fire, but since you mentioned it. Here's McCain arrogantly talking about ugly nationalism
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:36.540]  At some elitist meeting with we the people projected behind him when he's saying we the people at the tpp
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:40.700]  Unelected the secret will have more power than congress and trump comes along
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:48.700]  Destroys tpp moves it back to congress and they've got the nerve to sit there and claim that they're with we the people
[02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:55.020]  You mean we the globalist above the law megabanks. Here is john not long for this world mccain
[02:14:56.060 --> 02:14:59.100]  To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe
[02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:06.460]  To refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain the last best hope of earth
[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:10.620]  For the sake of some half-baked spurious nationalism

[02:19:53.500 --> 02:20:00.860]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:14.380]  Live from the info wars.com studios. You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.780]  The war was lost
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:21.420]  The treaty signed so the globalists think it's in style to destroy nation states
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:26.300]  And it isn't that the uk or europe or the us are perfect or brazil or anything else
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:32.620]  The globalists are trying to overthrow as well right now. We have populist uprisings. It's that people set them up
[02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:37.740]  They weren't perfect, but they were post-colonial most of them and they were trying to have basic human liberty
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:40.300]  They got set up during the renaissance
[02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:46.060]  Before globalism, which is just a new form of colonialism, but a technocracy based system in their own words
[02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:52.060]  And now notice you've got mccain speaking out against the nationalism
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:55.740]  With the iconography of we the people the constitution behind him
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:59.740]  But no american flags and remember
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:05.020]  At the dnc the first three days of the week. They had no american flags
[02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:11.180]  And again, i don't worship the american flag, but what are they trying to replace it with this globalism
[02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:16.940]  That just comes out of nowhere that that these elites just make up top trends forecaster jerry solente is our guest trends research
[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:20.140]  Dot com but look at the nfl commissioner
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:26.780]  He's on fox right now. He's having a press conference. We put it on screen the nfl symbol is an american flag
[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:30.060]  But see now they won't kneel
[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:33.260]  Or they won't stand during it. They want to kneel
[02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:36.220]  To make a big issue out of it
[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:43.260]  And again, it lets americans understand. Wow, there's an outside corporate force
[02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:48.060]  That really wants to get rid of the nation state and
[02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:54.140]  Basically demonize it and you have to ask yourself. Why are they doing that because they're replacing it with something
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:59.900]  Well, you better find out what that something is. They've already looted the third world. They set up
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:07.420]  Factories where they have suicide nets that charles solente was mentioning. They mean business. They're totally and completely ruthless
[02:22:07.420 --> 02:22:09.420]  Well, he came out three weeks ago and told trump
[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:13.420]  You disrespected the nfl when trump said you disrespected our veterans our country
[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:15.660]  You have a right to
[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:20.460]  Say you hate america if you want to the difference is you don't work for a company go out there dearing it
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:24.620]  Then be disrespectful and then whine when you've made 200 million dollars like capronik
[02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:30.860]  And then when you have two bad seasons wonder why nobody will hire you so you sue claiming you're being discriminated against because you're black
[02:22:31.100 --> 02:22:33.100]  When the nfl is 90 black
[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:37.100]  So again, it's an example of globalism
[02:22:37.580 --> 02:22:42.540]  Trying to destroy america and actually waking america up. They thought they had intimidated us
[02:22:43.100 --> 02:22:46.940]  We were asleep their intimidation now. They're slapping us in the face
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:51.900]  Woke us up. That's my view charles solente. What do you think about these battles?
[02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:57.980]  They're losing hollywood collapsing ratings down numbers down nfl collapsing mainstream news collapsing
[02:22:58.540 --> 02:23:03.340]  Everything they're doing collapsing now that they tried to force full domination on us
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:11.500]  Well, the nation's collapsing, you know, I was listening to this song, you know, california dreaming when were you going when I was coming on the air
[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:14.060]  And I was thinking about it
[02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:16.060]  there's no uh
[02:23:16.060 --> 02:23:22.620]  There's no songs about the cities anymore, you know going to kansas city. She's my tallahassee lassie
[02:23:22.780 --> 02:23:28.860]  Oh, I shouldn't say that. Maybe I'd be sexist if I sang tallahassee lassie, you know
[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:38.460]  But there's no songs about the cities anymore. I was just thinking about it when you know, chicago my kind of town new york new york
[02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:40.700]  We've lost the identity
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:43.100]  Of who we are
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:45.180]  It's time. It's part of that
[02:23:45.180 --> 02:23:48.620]  Globalism and multinationalization
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:56.540]  We shouldn't have any certain qualities of where we grew up who we are and what
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:24:02.860]  Represented us as we grew up. Don't even think about that. Just turn into
[02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:05.580]  Totally blank
[02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:11.500]  And that's what they're shoving down our throat again. We were growing up all these songs
[02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:14.780]  About where what city you wanted to go to?
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:21.180]  Because it was unique. It had its own culture. It had its own style gone
[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:28.940]  Gone into nothing. Oh by the way, everyone listening out there, you know, I know I've been out in your place
[02:24:29.180 --> 02:24:31.180]  I know how hard you people work
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:37.340]  Put your money where your mouth and ears are everyone listening. It's not a free ride
[02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:41.820]  Info wars isn't one of these non for profits
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:48.700]  You know all these people that like these universities that pay all these coaches and presidents
[02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:52.300]  Millions of dollars and don't pay any taxes
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:59.980]  This station has to stay alive by supporting them like we do with our trends journal and our information
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:07.260]  So I put my money where my mind in my mouth is and I buy info wars products
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:10.780]  By the way, Gerald, I know while you're raising this people should support you as well trendsresearch.com
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:14.460]  We're under attack the dirty tricks. We don't want to get into the air. You've been through it as well
[02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:18.300]  They really try to stop us because we're effective and you've written books about
[02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:21.740]  Bringing back local economies bringing back true diversity
[02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:29.340]  Globalism in diversity lets the corporate board claim that they represent all the cultures like the warden in a prison
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:32.380]  And then they direct society
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:38.380]  But the final frontier we have to fight them is voting with our dollars voting with our feet voting with our reviews
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:40.620]  And that's what you're letting people know is
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:44.700]  George Soros may have just put 18 billion in trying to kill the trump agenda
[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:48.300]  That's like literally 50 60 times. We normally does a year or more
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:55.500]  That's a sign of desperation Gerald. Do you agree? Oh, it is. Look what they're doing in Hungary. They threw Soros out
[02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:57.980]  You know, they're trying to stop them
[02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:02.700]  You know, look Alex the only way this country is really going to change as I see it
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:09.020]  And you can see it around the world is what we talked about with the AFD party in germany the freedom party in austria
[02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:14.860]  There's a chinko stella the five star movement in italy on and on we need a new party in america
[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:21.020]  We need a new way the democrats and the republicans are nothing more than the bloods and the crypts
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:25.660]  Murderers and you called for this for 20 years. Is it trump taking over the republican party?
[02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:30.300]  No siding sometimes with other groups. They're basically breaking their back partially
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:36.300]  What trump represents is the perfect analogy. He is no party
[02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:43.740]  Both parties are against him in so many ways, which is showing the opportunity for a new way now
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:48.380]  He's not aligned with either of them. That's why neither of them support him
[02:26:50.060 --> 02:26:52.300]  I'll be honest with you when you were always harping on this
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:54.220]  I'd say look, I don't think it's going to happen at this time
[02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:57.980]  But I think trump is an example and all the special elections we've seen
[02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:05.660]  Any mainline democrats losing any mainline republicans losing the people want true populism from the left and the right
[02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:13.580]  But the power structures fighting it fighting it fighting it instead of at least embracing it on the surface. They're so arrogant. They're not
[02:27:13.980 --> 02:27:17.820]  No, they're not because it's against their interest because who are they?
[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:24.380]  Prestitudes they get paid by their corporate johns and their washington whore masters
[02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:27.980]  I mean look at this stuff coming out. I just read about this guy jake tapper
[02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:35.020]  He used to go out with monica lawinsky writing that disgusting stuff about her and this guy shoot his mouth off with this arrogant attitude
[02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:39.100]  Look who we have over here in new york with this qualmo chris qualmo
[02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:43.500]  I remember him when I said to all the tv shows they bring him around with his little aides
[02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:51.100]  He was talking about you know sports and pop culture and now he's this arrogant guy born on third base and 30 in a home run
[02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:53.740]  He'd be nowhere if his old man wasn't mario
[02:27:54.060 --> 02:27:58.140]  Just like his brother andrew the privileged prince would be nowhere
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:04.060]  And they're still arrogant even though they have a shadow of their former audience and her plow in imploding
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:07.100]  They get more and more arrogant. Do they not know what losers they are?
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:14.300]  No, because again, you know, they've never had a work in their lives. It's all been given to them for free
[02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:18.060]  I'm gonna ask us when we come back
[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:23.100]  Your prediction politically how this is gonna go the different breaks. What happens if they assassinate trump?
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:28.620]  The so-called left wants a revolution in october a november 4th is when they launched their main attack
[02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:31.820]  They're promising violence nationwide. I think what we saw
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:32.940]  um
[02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:38.380]  In vegas was part of that the deep state covered it up because trump isn't in control of his own fbi yet
[02:28:38.620 --> 02:28:42.140]  And we'll talk the whole russia gait situation with gerol salente now
[02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:49.660]  We know why hillary was saying trump was a ruski because ladies and gentlemen her muller all of them were literally russian assets
[02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:51.980]  They had totally sold out
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:58.300]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals? Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?

[02:32:54.220 --> 02:33:01.580]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:13.100]  For every question they don't want you to ask
[02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:20.220]  He has the answer. They don't want you to hear. He is alex jones
[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:25.820]  Well, I wouldn't say I have the answer to every question notice. I didn't write that liner
[02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:28.380]  I got the cruise being nice
[02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:30.780]  But nine times out of ten. I have the answer
[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:35.340]  Because the globalist big miscalculation is acting like your idiots
[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:39.340]  They thought they would build a big giant private corporate world government
[02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:42.300]  Exempt themselves from the taxes the regulations
[02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:44.700]  give themselves
[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:46.700]  diplomatic immunity
[02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:48.860]  and then
[02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:50.860]  Once the planetary regime was in place
[02:33:51.500 --> 02:33:57.260]  Once they transferred all the nation-state power by the leaders to that new global power in this revolution
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:33:59.740]  of the bureaucrats against
[02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:06.860]  The nations and their peoples they would then bring in a worldwide autocratic authoritarian system. They call
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:09.580]  a technocracy
[02:34:09.580 --> 02:34:11.980]  managing and running our lives in a planned
[02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:13.740]  civilization
[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:20.460]  Where we are a permanent underclass and they are a permanent overclass and that from all their different books and white papers
[02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.860]  from Zbigniew Brzezinski to john p. Holdren
[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:26.300]  Is the
[02:34:26.380 --> 02:34:28.860]  altruistic or liberal or loving of you
[02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:32.460]  If you get into why the future doesn't need us
[02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:38.140]  And you get into what ray Kurzweil and google and others are talking about they go. Oh, you're lucky
[02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:42.140]  We don't just step on you like you're a bug once we merge with machines
[02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:45.660]  We're just going to be the new superhumans and you're all going to be dead
[02:34:47.580 --> 02:34:51.660]  That's ted turner. That's bill clinton. That's uh david rockefeller. That's
[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:57.020]  Pull it up. Even abc news reports oakford wimpfrey went to secret meetings with the rockefellers
[02:34:57.340 --> 02:34:59.340]  Just six years ago to discuss
[02:34:59.580 --> 02:35:00.620]  exterminating
[02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:05.660]  80 to 90 percent of the world population folks. I know this stuff sounds crazy. They're the crazy ones
[02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:09.020]  Now even though they'd ever get those plans into place
[02:35:09.020 --> 02:35:14.620]  It shows in a 21st century world view what old elites would do when they got inbred and crazy
[02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:18.220]  And we just start wars or start killing people or thinking they were god
[02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:22.620]  It's called megalomania and the old evil nazi collaborator
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:29.260]  George soros knows mainstream media is totally discredited. That's why in 1998
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:34.700]  60 minutes had him on he bragged and said i'm not ashamed to be in a nazi. I did what I had to do to survive
[02:35:35.260 --> 02:35:37.660]  In fact, it was free market. I filled an itch. I'm proud of it
[02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:40.220]  In 2017 he has
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:42.940]  His minion
[02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:48.060]  Get up there from the cia anderson cooper and say it never happened. Alex shone's made it up despite the fact
[02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:55.500]  We have the clip that shows how weak they are. They know they're exposed. So just tell bigger lies talk about hitler and the big lie theory
[02:35:56.460 --> 02:35:57.500]  so
[02:35:57.500 --> 02:36:01.100]  when you financially support us by buying supplements and t-shirts and
[02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:04.620]  Books and videos and all the hottest titles you name it
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:11.900]  To help wake yourself and others up more it funds us to continue to reach out to others and have other great brains on the broadcast like
[02:36:11.900 --> 02:36:13.340]  Gerald Salente
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:18.060]  And so that's why it's a revolutionary act to financially support this broadcast
[02:36:18.140 --> 02:36:22.540]  And we've got specials that are ending in the next few days 50 off brain force is the known
[02:36:22.860 --> 02:36:28.060]  Highest quality healthy organic compounds for healthy. You're more active focused brain
[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:30.940]  20 percent now and more in each bottle
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:36.620]  We're doing 50 off not because it's not selling we sold so much of it's gotten so popular that
[02:36:37.340 --> 02:36:39.420]  I ordered the biggest order ever of it
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:46.220]  So I could do it 50 off to see if my free market idea would work to sell even more at lower prices
[02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:52.380]  Make you even happier and fund ourselves to expand a win-win. It's worked. I thought we had a two month supply
[02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:54.460]  It'll be sold out in a couple weeks at this rate
[02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:59.100]  So I've got it in the special in the next few days and then put it back to regular price until more comes in
[02:36:59.100 --> 02:37:01.100]  And that is going to end in the next few days
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:08.300]  Secret 12 40 percent off about to end survival shield x2 40 percent off about to end bio tricillinium for mustard seeds strong strong
[02:37:08.540 --> 02:37:15.260]  Formulation 40 percent off the new specials that will continue for a week or more and throw plexer until they sell out 50 percent off
[02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:19.260]  That's the dry form of supermal vitality and supermal vitality 30 percent off
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:23.740]  highest quality known organic high quality herbs ladies and gentlemen
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:28.620]  That have passed the strict almost impossible california standards
[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:35.740]  Until we know someday what we've talked about. We know they're going to do but the point is ladies and gentlemen
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:43.100]  It's all available at info wars live.com info wars store.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:46.940]  And again, Gerald Salente has his trends journal. He has his free updates
[02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:53.500]  You can sign up for and get as well. It is critical an absolute act of war against the globalist
[02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:56.620]  I know that you already know all about this stuff
[02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:03.900]  But ladies and gentlemen your friends your family your neighbors don't we're in a war people are ready to wake up now
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:11.100]  So please support the broadcast. Please get the word out trends research dot com
[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:13.980]  Gerald we've only got about five minutes left in this segment
[02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:17.340]  I've got another one. I want to get into political correctness and culture war with you
[02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:23.020]  But instead of me asking some of the questions here. What else is front and center on your trends your predictions?
[02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:25.580]  the whole trump era
[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:31.580]  Different possible futures that you see and what happens if they kill president trump something they're publicly trying to organize
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:36.220]  well going on to the the future and what we see is that
[02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:43.100]  We're talking about the populist movements, you know our method of tracking trends is called global nomic
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:48.460]  It means making connections between different fields and we're talking about populism and nationalism
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:51.180]  One thing to really consider
[02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:56.140]  And again the motto is think for yourself is what's going on with these crypto currencies
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:38:58.940]  This is real. This isn't dying
[02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:06.620]  It's an expression of people's disgust with the fiat currencies and the globalized central bankers
[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:12.700]  This is like my generation. It was buying gold. I bought my first
[02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:16.620]  gold buy at 187 50 dollars an ounce
[02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:22.300]  And and and now today the millennials their gold is cryptocurrency
[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:24.780]  It all ties together
[02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:31.820]  We're looking at a breakdown of a fight among the people against the system
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:38.620]  And this is one of the ways of breaking the system because if you break the bank, then you're really in trouble
[02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:45.340]  That's why you got a guy like jayme diamond screaming out that bitcoin is a fraud and after all
[02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:48.140]  He should know what a fraud is
[02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:55.820]  He he's saying it because it's going to put the banks out of business. That's why the banks don't like it
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:40:02.620]  Number two very important, and I'm sure your audience knows it but for those that may have not heard it
[02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:05.260]  China is now
[02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:09.420]  Accepting when they buy iranian oil or russian oil
[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:15.740]  Instead of paying them in petro dollars the us dollars that were based on oil
[02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:18.700]  Prices they're paying them in yuan
[02:40:19.420 --> 02:40:22.540]  And saying you can cash the yuan in for gold
[02:40:22.540 --> 02:40:28.300]  This is big now. Remember the deal of the petro dollar was made between
[02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:33.420]  Nixon and the saudi king back in about 1974
[02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:37.980]  Now they're saying to saudi arabia the chinese
[02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:44.220]  No, we're not going to buy your oil and pay it in dollars. We're going to pay you
[02:40:44.860 --> 02:40:48.060]  In yuan. They're telling the Saudis this
[02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:55.660]  And they may buy five percent of ramco the big saudi company that they're going to the oil field
[02:40:56.540 --> 02:41:02.460]  The giant oil company of saudi arabia that you're going to put on the market
[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:06.540]  They may buy five percent of this the reason i'm mentioning this
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:10.220]  If the petro dollar dies
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:16.460]  The us dollar will crash and so too will the economy
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:23.340]  This is a reality. This isn't just speculation. It's happening in front of us. So what does that mean?
[02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:30.220]  Well, the crypto currencies they're trying to stop those in a lot of countries. So what will people buy when they're
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:32.860]  Value with a fiat currencies dies?
[02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:35.660]  gold and silver
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:41.660]  Continue with the breton woods agreement and the petro dollar
[02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:46.140]  What's going to happen china doesn't want to deal with dollars anymore
[02:41:46.940 --> 02:41:53.100]  So they're not taking the petro dollar. They're not taking us bucks. They're giving so when you're buying your oil
[02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:59.180]  I'm chinese. I'm buying your saudi arabian oil. I'm not going to pay you in bucks. I'm paying you in my yuan
[02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:01.820]  But you could cash my yuan into gold
[02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:06.060]  So it's becoming very attractive because once upon a time
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:09.100]  You could cash the dollar in for gold
[02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:11.900]  But you can't do that anymore. And by the way, let me point this out
[02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:17.100]  The university of texas and hundreds of other big institutions while gold went down for a while now
[02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:22.140]  It's gone back up some have been buying billions of dollars of it. So the elites while telling you don't get gold
[02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:25.580]  They're the ones that are actually getting into it
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:32.460]  Yeah, and again if this petro dollar goes down, you know the us dollar crashes
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:35.820]  You'd be going to Walmart's with a wheelbarrow of money
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:41.740]  Like they used to do in weimar republic germany. That's right. Let's talk more about the dark side of the economy
[02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:46.460]  We're hoping things get better and we're rooting for it. But what happens if the globalists are able to stop trump?
[02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:48.460]  We'll talk about it with gerol salente
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:56.060]  We're not just going to have to end of the next week the brain force plus special 50 off

[02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:22.940]  You are listening to an info wars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[02:47:23.340 --> 02:47:27.980]  You are the resistance, you know normally if three people been shot dead and others have been shot
[02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:31.260]  There was a guy on the run in a major city. You'd hear about it
[02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:34.380]  But not of ease of black guy who's a muslim
[02:47:34.380 --> 02:47:43.340]  Maryland state police release ID of at-large shooter raheed la bieb prince
[02:47:45.340 --> 02:47:47.340]  Armed and dangerous
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:51.420]  Now let's curl down and read some of this article. We're going to post it up on info wars dot com
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:58.540]  There you go, uh raheed la bieb is suspected of shooting five people in Maryland business park
[02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:00.860]  This morning
[02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:06.540]  Five people were shot three have been reported dead. He remains at large and considered armed and dangerous the story's developing
[02:48:07.180 --> 02:48:10.460]  But of course it's not on cnn. It's not on fox. It's not because
[02:48:11.500 --> 02:48:14.700]  Well, that's why they shut down the whole story in vegas folks
[02:48:15.260 --> 02:48:17.260]  Because when there's an islamic attack
[02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:22.300]  It doesn't happen. Why are they bringing all these unvetted islamist in the center of the country?
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:29.420]  I'm going to ask Gerald salente that the moment also get into the dark side of an economy imploding and where he sees all of that unfolding
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:32.620]  Uh, and but but but first I want to get into this
[02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:39.420]  Uh, there is a report out where an economist and in financial researcher that I know it has been a pretty smart guy
[02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:42.780]  And I know that Gerald has at least I've seen written some nice things about
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:47.660]  Mark fauber resigns that were saying thank god white people populated america
[02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:50.460]  Now let let's be clear about this
[02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:53.740]  You can read his quote
[02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:58.220]  With all these black lives matter groups and the bbc and others saying whites are inherently bad
[02:48:58.220 --> 02:49:00.300]  I'm going to play a clip of that so he responds saying well
[02:49:01.180 --> 02:49:04.540]  You know whites have built civilization. Why does everybody say they're so bad?
[02:49:05.340 --> 02:49:07.340]  Because you don't see that being built in africa today
[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:11.340]  You know my issue is this europeans have been barbarous as well
[02:49:11.660 --> 02:49:16.140]  But the renaissance was an idea of not doing that and so why is it under such attack?
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:18.620]  I've got a clip right here
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:20.780]  of uh monroe
[02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:22.300]  burgdorke
[02:49:22.300 --> 02:49:25.980]  On racism in the uk. This is a program on the bbc
[02:49:25.980 --> 02:49:32.940]  We played a lot of these clips where people going to denounce that white people are inherently evil now hitler said jews were inherently evil
[02:49:33.340 --> 02:49:35.740]  So i'm not saying blacks are inherently evil. I'm not saying
[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:40.540]  I'm not saying anybody's inherently evil. There's bad groups everywhere can be it can be cultural
[02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:43.980]  It can also be you know genetic tendencies in a family whatever
[02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:49.820]  Just like the guy, you know reporter that did the vegas attack his dad was a convicted psychopath
[02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:55.260]  You know bank robber tried to kill folks with cars. You name it bragged about it. Well this uh
[02:49:55.820 --> 02:49:58.460]  Gz don't use the wrong word. I'll get arrested in california
[02:49:59.020 --> 02:50:06.300]  Has come out as this fountain of wisdom and told us whites are inherently more barbarous more violent more evil actually crime statistics show
[02:50:06.780 --> 02:50:11.340]  Say it's cultural whatever here in the us blacks are 10 times more likely similar numbers in europe
[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:15.260]  And it's even higher with muslims, but I mean i'm just saying the statistics
[02:50:15.260 --> 02:50:19.740]  But you're saying i'm inherently a bad person. So why don't you resign?
[02:50:20.380 --> 02:50:22.860]  Oh, because it's okay because you're being racist against whites
[02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:25.740]  What you say is five times more brutal than what faber says
[02:50:25.740 --> 02:50:30.220]  I want to play this and then get uh jerala salentes take on all this culture war garbage that i know
[02:50:30.380 --> 02:50:35.740]  He just wants to transcend like i do with us having a unified culture of free market open real societies
[02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:39.020]  Uh, but let's go ahead and play the uh clip of the racist training
[02:50:39.020 --> 02:50:46.940]  If white people want to see an improvement for people of color, they need to understand that racism is not learned
[02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:52.220]  It's inherited and either consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:59.020]  The uncomfortable truth is that the white race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth
[02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:05.340]  My worry is that whatever governments do to tinker with institutional racism
[02:51:05.340 --> 02:51:11.500]  It is so ingrained in the fabric of british society that it is too late to do anything about it
[02:51:12.540 --> 02:51:16.140]  And then i've got all these videos of the new thing is men dressed up like women
[02:51:16.140 --> 02:51:19.100]  But then in demon clown outfits going and scaring kids
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:26.220]  At school libraries and it's like look if we can put a guy in a demon clown outfit in a room with a bunch of little kids
[02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:30.620]  I mean you'd run at the park from these guys, but it's okay because they're like this
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:38.060]  Group on a pedestal telling you that you're inherently baggage. You're white. What is going on with abc nbc cbs bbc
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:42.060]  All of these groups force feeding this. What is this gerald salante?
[02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:47.020]  It's it's happened as soon as trump started running. It's the division of america
[02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:49.580]  And that's when it really began
[02:51:50.300 --> 02:51:53.900]  And and that woman who was mentioning this. Oh, yeah, things are lovely, right?
[02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:58.380]  Aren't they beautiful over there in somalia? How many just died the other day?
[02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:02.940]  Oh, holy little over 300. Oh a beautiful day in the congo
[02:52:03.340 --> 02:52:09.100]  I think i'm going to take my next vacation in molly. Maybe niger. Maybe
[02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:15.740]  Cameroon look what's going on in africa good embed comes in all races creeds and colors
[02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:22.300]  They're doing this to divide the nation and i'm and of course america is definitely a racist nation
[02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:29.180]  I mean after all the last president we had obama. I think he was a couple of shades lighter than me
[02:52:29.580 --> 02:52:35.500]  And who was the attorney general? Oh, yeah, that garbage piece of crap. Oh, I shouldn't say that
[02:52:36.060 --> 02:52:41.340]  Eric hold up hold this eric the guy that didn't bring one of those banksters to jail
[02:52:41.660 --> 02:52:47.660]  I think he was a and jay johnson a black guy and loretta lance, but it's just it. No, it's white people
[02:52:47.660 --> 02:52:54.940]  How about condoleezza rice? How about that low-life piece of garbage who sold us the iraq war
[02:52:55.500 --> 02:52:56.940]  colon powell
[02:52:56.940 --> 02:52:58.940]  Oh, you know what alex
[02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:04.860]  You know what passes through the colon why is he that why is he named after the final part of the lower intestine?
[02:53:05.100 --> 02:53:07.100]  Because he's crap
[02:53:07.260 --> 02:53:14.140]  Look what he did that he should be brought up on war crime tribunals with his little piece of colon crap
[02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:19.180]  showing us this is proof but wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute white people are the only people that do bad
[02:53:19.340 --> 02:53:22.700]  That's not racist. So what i'm saying is are there racists?
[02:53:22.940 --> 02:53:28.540]  Of course there are other people that don't like italians don't like jews don't like of course
[02:53:29.020 --> 02:53:32.300]  They're ignorant people. This is not a racist country
[02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:38.540]  We elected a black and they know we're not so they use our weakness that we don't want to be racist against us
[02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:40.620]  Because they know we have a conscience and i'm sick of it
[02:53:41.580 --> 02:53:42.620]  again
[02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:49.740]  When obama got elected and i'm doing media all over the world. He was gonna be the savior
[02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:55.260]  Remember he won the no-bell piece of crap
[02:53:55.740 --> 02:53:57.100]  prize
[02:53:57.100 --> 02:54:01.420]  After he got it he gets since 30 000 more troops
[02:54:01.900 --> 02:54:03.900]  to afghanistan
[02:54:03.820 --> 02:54:05.820]  Kills over
[02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:11.660]  4 000 innocent people with drone strikes quote i'm really good at killing people
[02:54:11.660 --> 02:54:13.340]  Oh
[02:54:13.340 --> 02:54:18.060]  Does it make a difference when you black white male female?
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:27.420]  Whatever religion you believe in good and bad comes in all of them. It's the media that's dividing us now as a trend forecaster
[02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:30.620]  i'm gonna tell you one of our top trends for 2018
[02:54:31.260 --> 02:54:36.860]  You know that they're dividing us if you're a company if you're selling a product
[02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:44.460]  Whatever you're doing sell unity not unity to fight someone go back to remember that song
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:50.860]  Remember the how what about the love train?
[02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:54.700]  What about the love train because because they say black lives matter whites and cops are evil
[02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:58.780]  That's not unity. That's race war. We say let's just all come together and be free and be good
[02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:00.300]  exactly
[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:03.740]  And as trend forecasters we tell our clients
[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:10.060]  This is a direction to go in as they're dividing you unite. We're all in this together
[02:55:10.780 --> 02:55:17.580]  We're all americans. We're all here because it was the land of opportunity that our ancestors came to
[02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:22.540]  We're here because of the declaration of independence and the constitution
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:27.100]  So let's get straight over here. You want to go somewhere else leave
[02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:34.220]  But if you want to be an american live by the principles of what made this country great at one time
[02:55:35.020 --> 02:55:37.020]  That's right. And what the globalists are doing is
[02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:40.300]  They're saying throw out all the rules forget those don't look at them
[02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:45.420]  Even though it's the plan that move forward to try to actually make people have equal opportunity
[02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:52.940]  They want to destroy that and give us the global model. That's totally secret totally authoritarian and has slave factories all over the world
[02:55:52.940 --> 02:55:58.700]  What are we doing listening to these people? It's so obvious. Then we get their internal wiki leaks and they say
[02:55:58.860 --> 02:56:03.020]  We're going to use racial division to control the general population while we
[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:10.140]  Basically use them and make them poor so we can control them into the future. I mean, they're literally dynamiting
[02:56:10.700 --> 02:56:15.580]  The ladders up to success admitting it and then telling us how altruistic they are
[02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:20.860]  Again, look at obama used to brag about all the jobs he created folks
[02:56:20.860 --> 02:56:22.860]  They focus us all right
[02:56:23.100 --> 02:56:30.140]  He created 94 percent of the jobs that were created according to the Harvard Princeton study a temporary jobs
[02:56:30.540 --> 02:56:36.620]  So they're using the racism divisiveness because they're stealing all our dough the money's right
[02:56:36.700 --> 02:56:41.500]  Everybody knows where it went to the 1 percent. Well, I'm making this stuff. So let me ask you this question
[02:56:42.620 --> 02:56:45.900]  Why do they hate trump so much not that he's perfect, but they really hate him
[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:51.500]  Because he's not a member of the club and he's destroying it at different levels
[02:56:52.380 --> 02:56:57.500]  That's it. And by the way, I was with Anthony Frida a couple of years a couple of weeks ago
[02:56:57.660 --> 02:57:00.940]  He's the illustrator as you well know for our magazine same guy work
[02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:04.220]  And we had lunch with the Robert trump
[02:57:04.780 --> 02:57:10.700]  Donald Trump's brother that Anthony Frida knows and he was very gentlemanly and very, you know respectful
[02:57:10.700 --> 02:57:17.420]  And and they hate trump because he's anti establishment does he do a lot of things? I like no

[02:59:53.340 --> 03:00:07.340]  music
[03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:15.900]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:00:17.420 --> 03:00:20.860]  Coming up in the next segment i'm introduced roger stone is hosting the fourth hour
[03:00:20.860 --> 03:00:26.300]  Let me get drill salinity sometime to start hosting with us. We've got a lot of new broadcasts war room coming up three o'clock
[03:00:26.540 --> 03:00:28.540]  Maybe not in the morning with the real news
[03:00:28.700 --> 03:00:32.300]  But there's some news that I forgot about getting into as I checked it out. It was true
[03:00:33.020 --> 03:00:36.780]  george soros shorted mgm the week before the attack
[03:00:38.140 --> 03:00:43.580]  47 million dollars meaning I guess he made way way more than that and then you've got
[03:00:43.580 --> 03:00:50.380]  You've got the whole leftist agenda and the in the sjw islamis is that own mgm
[03:00:51.660 --> 03:00:54.620]  And ellen jenette ellen's generous is invested in mgm
[03:00:55.100 --> 03:01:02.380]  And it's part of mgm and owns a bunch of slot machines with mgm or she gets paid money off those ellen's slot machines
[03:01:02.620 --> 03:01:09.420]  So that conflict of interest is coming up as the whole cover-up implodes vegas survivor who died suddenly had planned group to
[03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:13.420]  expose cover-up and look, I know there's a lot of globalists out there, but
[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:17.100]  george soros
[03:01:17.180 --> 03:01:21.580]  Literally owns and runs the groups that finance the disinfo against us
[03:01:22.380 --> 03:01:25.420]  The lawsuits the lies the projects all of it
[03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:30.060]  And it's an old crazy weird nazi collaborator. It makes you ask when is it going to end?
[03:01:30.860 --> 03:01:35.020]  So we'll talk about that with roger stone the huge new russia stuff drill salinity
[03:01:35.020 --> 03:01:39.500]  Obviously the economy is coming back. I never said we could have a three percent growth again
[03:01:39.500 --> 03:01:44.860]  We did but there's big systemic problems if you don't get the tax cuts done free spending done get rid of obama care
[03:01:45.020 --> 03:01:49.740]  It's designed to bankrupt it by design as you've announced as your analysis has showed
[03:01:50.860 --> 03:01:55.740]  If trump fails if the globalists with interest rate hikes and things are able to beat him as they admit
[03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:59.180]  They're trying to do will they get the blame or will the populace get the blame?
[03:01:59.580 --> 03:02:01.740]  And what can we do to short circuit what they're doing?
[03:02:01.740 --> 03:02:06.140]  The populace won't get to blame this time is going to rot from the head down
[03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:14.220]  The imf came out with a study. They just showed that the g20 nations have a total debt of one point
[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:20.140]  Excuse me 30 13.5 trillion dollars
[03:02:21.820 --> 03:02:23.820]  They're not going to be able to pay that off
[03:02:24.380 --> 03:02:31.100]  It's all of the private equity groups the hedge funds all of this gambling that's been going on with this cheap money
[03:02:31.100 --> 03:02:33.420]  And trump talked about that during the campaign
[03:02:34.140 --> 03:02:36.620]  They built a bubble that's ready to burst
[03:02:37.260 --> 03:02:40.460]  It and again, you know just as a fish rots in the head down
[03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:46.060]  This crash is going to come from the top down and we're already seeing it in certain markets
[03:02:46.460 --> 03:02:52.940]  The high-end homes the ones one three one five million. They're not selling like they used to they're not selling at all
[03:02:53.180 --> 03:02:58.780]  In some areas the high expensive luxury condominiums are in selling
[03:02:58.780 --> 03:03:04.700]  We believe it's peeking out at the top if interest rates go up too fast
[03:03:04.940 --> 03:03:07.900]  They're going to go up 25 percent in december
[03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:15.580]  Excuse me 20 25 basis points in december and that's not a lot that'll be able to hold it
[03:03:15.740 --> 03:03:21.740]  But if they raise them say three more times in 2018, you're going to see this thing come down
[03:03:22.060 --> 03:03:27.580]  They won't blame it on the populace. They won't blame it on trump. They'll blame it on the bigs
[03:03:27.580 --> 03:03:31.180]  That's where it's coming from and those are the globalists
[03:03:31.420 --> 03:03:35.420]  They're taking over the entire world. They've taken over the markets
[03:03:35.660 --> 03:03:43.180]  So when this stock market goes down, who's it going to affect the five percent because the rest of the people aren't in it
[03:03:43.820 --> 03:03:49.900]  Well, so the other thing too that's important is that you know, we were the you know me a lot of years
[03:03:50.220 --> 03:03:52.220]  When trump got elected within days
[03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:56.460]  We said the trump rally was real
[03:03:56.460 --> 03:04:04.060]  It's still going on if there's not a correction and there has to be one at the end of this month
[03:04:04.540 --> 03:04:07.260]  We're saying there'll be about a 10 correction
[03:04:07.900 --> 03:04:11.500]  In january february or march, but if we make it through
[03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:18.540]  October then it'll be free-sailing until then because the market is you know, it's blown up
[03:04:18.540 --> 03:04:27.020]  But again earnings are well earnings are high. So that's positive too
[03:04:27.020 --> 03:04:33.100]  All right, Gerald Salente always thought-provoking always powerful trendsresearch.com everybody bookmarked that and Gerald

[03:06:37.580 --> 03:06:43.260]  Roger stone's hosting the fourth hour then the war room with elin shroyer and roger stone is coming up
[03:06:43.980 --> 03:06:46.380]  Now I saw this a few days ago and I mentioned it
[03:06:46.380 --> 03:06:50.300]  But I burrowed into it and actually went to the securities and exchange commission
[03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:54.060]  And we'll put that on on screen in a few minutes and confirmed it
[03:06:54.780 --> 03:07:00.060]  And with everything else that's come out. We're getting a really clear picture. You got sjw is that own the mgm
[03:07:00.700 --> 03:07:03.980]  They're telling all their employees will give you a time off you name it
[03:07:04.380 --> 03:07:07.980]  If you just double the amount of money that we're giving if you match it
[03:07:08.620 --> 03:07:14.220]  We'll match the money you give to soros groups to the southern poverty law center
[03:07:14.220 --> 03:07:20.380]  To the national islamic council here in the u.s. Which is basically the muslim brotherhood hamas connected
[03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:26.220]  And then all this happens. There's a big cover up the media says isis isn't involved this comey
[03:07:27.580 --> 03:07:28.700]  Mueller
[03:07:28.700 --> 03:07:34.700]  Appointee covers it all up. It's incredible. But here's the headline out of investment watch. Wow
[03:07:35.340 --> 03:07:39.020]  Soros had a 42 million dollar short on mgm
[03:07:39.020 --> 03:07:46.620]  He always gets all the inside knowledge and so I guess made a couple hundred million dollars off that baby put in right beforehand
[03:07:47.820 --> 03:07:49.980]  That was perfect. And then of course you got this young lady
[03:07:49.980 --> 03:07:56.140]  She was start a victims group of survivors that saw the multiple shooters and had their videos taken away by the fbi
[03:07:56.140 --> 03:08:03.180]  Well, she ended up dead. She's 28 that story is up on drugsreport.com kimberley schoemel 28 wanted to investigate. Well, she's dead now
[03:08:04.700 --> 03:08:06.700]  Dead men or dead women tell no tales
[03:08:06.700 --> 03:08:10.460]  I lost vegas security guard breaks silence on ellen after disappearance
[03:08:10.460 --> 03:08:12.540]  So he was going to go on Hannity, but then said he wouldn't
[03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:18.300]  They changed the timeline that he was getting shot at six minutes before they claimed other witnesses said that was shooting inside
[03:08:19.740 --> 03:08:22.380]  The mandalay bay, but also at the Bellagio
[03:08:23.020 --> 03:08:28.620]  Lost vegas security guard breaks silence on ellen after disappearance. Oh and look ellen
[03:08:29.580 --> 03:08:35.580]  ellen owns and is involved makes money off slot machines with the whole mgm leftist combine
[03:08:35.580 --> 03:08:37.580]  Okay
[03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:40.540]  So there you go. And now you got vegas police blame journalist
[03:08:41.420 --> 03:08:45.740]  Laura loomer for the missing security guard because he didn't want to be found they said
[03:08:46.140 --> 03:08:52.380]  He had to I guess get his uh four or five days of debriefing ready before for the story changed yet again
[03:08:52.460 --> 03:08:54.460]  I mean ladies and gentlemen
[03:08:55.260 --> 03:08:57.580]  Soros is like cockroaches meet
[03:08:59.900 --> 03:09:01.260]  Herpes
[03:09:01.260 --> 03:09:03.260]  It's like herpes with legs
[03:09:03.260 --> 03:09:08.540]  It won't go away. It always comes back. I don't want to just sit here and make him the devil that's involved
[03:09:08.540 --> 03:09:11.100]  But every time I got some groups showing me
[03:09:11.900 --> 03:09:17.420]  That's the new york fellow reserve board member or it's george soros funded or it's or it's I mean these people are aphorists
[03:09:17.420 --> 03:09:22.700]  It's okay because as they turn the heat up on us hillary had almost three billion trump four hundred something million
[03:09:22.860 --> 03:09:23.900]  We beat him
[03:09:23.900 --> 03:09:28.140]  He just went from billions a year globally to 18 billion trying to destroy everybody
[03:09:28.460 --> 03:09:30.460]  It's not going to work as long as you understand

[03:11:26.620 --> 03:11:34.060]  How does it feel to be totally vindicated to be the first person on radio and tv a year and a half ago to break down the entire narrative?
[03:11:34.220 --> 03:11:36.220]  You've been proven correct in triplicate
[03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:42.460]  Well, alex, um, I thank you for that. Uh, you were the one who called the entire
[03:11:42.460 --> 03:11:44.060]  uh
[03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:47.500]  charade about donald trump being a sexual assaulter
[03:11:48.300 --> 03:11:51.020]  and the left's new attempts to revive that
[03:11:51.740 --> 03:11:53.740]  already discredited
[03:11:53.740 --> 03:12:00.460]  narrative by getting women to step forward and bear false witness against our president you predicted it
[03:12:00.940 --> 03:12:04.540]  Months ago here. It has come to pass just days ago
[03:12:05.100 --> 03:12:10.380]  look, um when nbc nightly news was forced to cover the fact that the
[03:12:10.380 --> 03:12:14.860]  obama justice department mewler comey macabe
[03:12:15.420 --> 03:12:20.380]  Uh, and yes, rosinstein had been caught red-handed in a massive cover-up
[03:12:20.860 --> 03:12:27.500]  That they knew about russian bribery and russian shenanigans to get control
[03:12:28.060 --> 03:12:34.620]  Of american produced enriched uranium and to get hillary clinton, uh, and her husband paid off
[03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:40.620]  literally millions in order to approve a deal that allowed them to take control
[03:12:41.260 --> 03:12:48.780]  Of our uranium mining at least 20 percent of it. Um, this has a really busted washington wide open
[03:12:49.500 --> 03:12:52.540]  The exact people who are claiming that donald trump
[03:12:53.020 --> 03:13:02.060]  Colluded with the russians are the ones who were covering up obama clinton collusion with the russians. They are so busted
[03:13:02.060 --> 03:13:06.940]  They are so caught red and what was it like for you to now see sessions finally
[03:13:07.500 --> 03:13:10.620]  Putting on big boy pants getting out of his little little little baby shorts
[03:13:10.620 --> 03:13:16.620]  I'm not being mean a fact and saying hillary is under criminal investigation in the judiciary committee meeting this morning
[03:13:17.180 --> 03:13:22.780]  Well not add that to the fact that the senate judiciary committee has announced their own investigation
[03:13:23.260 --> 03:13:26.300]  Into the russian cover-up. It's about time
[03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:30.700]  So mewler and all of their energy was desperately to cover up that they indeed had done it
[03:13:30.700 --> 03:13:32.700]  You were the first to say that about
[03:13:33.100 --> 03:13:38.620]  Uh, because you knew the history and it had been in news years before about podesta saying his time in the barrel was coming
[03:13:38.860 --> 03:13:45.100]  They used that to claim that you had gotten it from wiki leaks, which of course you hadn't but they changed the subject from what they've done
[03:13:45.420 --> 03:13:51.180]  To wiki leaks by extension claiming you're a russian agent when they're on the tarmac literally handing over the uranium
[03:13:51.580 --> 03:13:58.060]  Now let's be clear. I learned about john podesta in the panama papers in january of last year
[03:13:58.060 --> 03:14:03.260]  Uh, I further learned about it in a stunning piece by jerry coursey
[03:14:03.660 --> 03:14:07.340]  Then of world net daily now of info wars that exposed
[03:14:07.900 --> 03:14:14.220]  All of the inside dealing done by let's just get her on she broke it. Oh, what happened to her three days ago
[03:14:14.460 --> 03:14:18.540]  Yeah, blown up. Isn't that amazing the journalists who first exposed john podesta
[03:14:18.940 --> 03:14:25.420]  Literally blown uh to hell uh, but maybe it was natural causes like uh, it's seth rich
[03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:30.780]  Well, and here's uh, and here's uh something else that you have exactly right alex and that is
[03:14:31.180 --> 03:14:38.220]  George soros is the evil puppet master behind all of this the lawsuit against me by protect democracy
[03:14:38.300 --> 03:14:46.220]  This is financed by soros the lawsuit against you from this wacky group in california financed by soros
[03:14:46.380 --> 03:14:48.380]  Why are the are we being targeted?
[03:14:48.540 --> 03:14:53.180]  Because we are on to him and we are exposing him and we are making it hurt
[03:14:53.180 --> 03:14:56.540]  Now this really pains me to say alex, but
[03:14:57.020 --> 03:15:04.220]  The the dinosaur barbecue chain in new york some of the best barbecue. I've had outside of austin texas
[03:15:04.780 --> 03:15:09.660]  locations baltimore brooklyn buffalo harlem newark rochester stanford

[03:15:15.820 --> 03:15:20.700]  So do not eat there and research every group the nfl all of it. It's all enemies
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:26.620]  But we are boycotting dinosaur barbecue, which is a shame because it's the best barbecue

[03:20:32.060 --> 03:20:37.020]  I'm roger stone and you're back on the alex jones show
[03:20:38.220 --> 03:20:39.580]  when senator
[03:20:39.580 --> 03:20:50.620]  John mccain was a standing for reelection in the 2016 elections, donald j trump had swept the republican primaries and was on his way
[03:20:51.180 --> 03:20:53.740]  To sweeping the era zona primary
[03:20:54.220 --> 03:21:01.340]  senator mccain was opposed in that primary in a competitive race by state senator kelly ward
[03:21:02.060 --> 03:21:05.980]  I implored candidate trump to endorse ward or at least
[03:21:05.980 --> 03:21:13.180]  At withhold his endorsement from john mccain, but rince previs and others
[03:21:13.740 --> 03:21:18.780]  Persuaded candidate trump to endorse mccain who then
[03:21:19.820 --> 03:21:23.420]  Fairly narrowly won his primary and went on to
[03:21:23.900 --> 03:21:31.260]  Certain reelection as donald trump swept arizona as did all republicans in the november election
[03:21:31.260 --> 03:21:37.740]  That act of kindness in which donald trump could have ended the career of john mccain
[03:21:38.220 --> 03:21:44.380]  Has been paid back with nothing but treachery since that time now john mccain's
[03:21:45.100 --> 03:21:47.740]  red-faced temper tantrums his
[03:21:48.460 --> 03:21:51.420]  Tourette's like outbursts of peak
[03:21:52.060 --> 03:22:00.220]  His seething meltdowns his bitterness and jealousy are things of legend in washington
[03:22:00.220 --> 03:22:04.380]  John mccain is not a man in his right mind
[03:22:05.100 --> 03:22:12.620]  as a christian i'm going to ascribe his uh erratic behavior to his illness and of course
[03:22:13.100 --> 03:22:21.820]  We wish him well in that struggle against brain cancer, but yesterday john mccain went too far
[03:22:22.300 --> 03:22:29.260]  He not only attacked our president, but he attacked the movement and the voters that elected him
[03:22:29.260 --> 03:22:33.660]  This is disgraceful. I think we may have a clip
[03:22:34.460 --> 03:22:40.540]  Uh, if not, we you can uh, you can see that drudge led with this item
[03:22:41.180 --> 03:22:42.380]  now
[03:22:42.380 --> 03:22:46.700]  Donald trump who is a street fighter himself a brawler
[03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:55.180]  A guy who battled his way not only to the nomination over 15 more experienced candidates, but over the wanted
[03:22:55.180 --> 03:23:00.620]  Well oiled extremely well financed clinton machine
[03:23:01.340 --> 03:23:06.140]  Had words of warning for uh senator mccain
[03:23:06.780 --> 03:23:12.540]  He basically said he is not going to return the turn the other cheek forever
[03:23:13.100 --> 03:23:20.700]  He has bitten his tongue as john mccain has scuttled the obama care replacement
[03:23:20.700 --> 03:23:29.660]  It he has bitten his tongue while john mccain said that the russian collusion scandal was worse than watergate
[03:23:30.060 --> 03:23:32.540]  No senator. It's not you have nothing
[03:23:33.420 --> 03:23:36.540]  I bit my tongue when senator john mccain said
[03:23:37.020 --> 03:23:40.780]  Roger stone should be compelled before to come before the senate
[03:23:41.500 --> 03:23:49.580]  And explain his relationship with uh, yukanovich the former president of ukraine and the russians
[03:23:49.580 --> 03:23:53.340]  Well senator i'm going to say this slowly so you can follow me
[03:23:53.980 --> 03:23:55.980]  I have no relationship with either
[03:23:56.780 --> 03:24:04.620]  Your demagoguery is not appreciated. You owe me an apology, but while we're at it senator. I've got a question for you
[03:24:05.660 --> 03:24:08.220]  Why did you meet with olig dera pasca?
[03:24:08.540 --> 03:24:14.940]  Who was a bagman oligarch for vladimir putin during your campaign for president?
[03:24:14.940 --> 03:24:22.300]  You were warned by the fbi that he was a russian agent, but you chose to meet with him anyway
[03:24:22.940 --> 03:24:29.740]  Here's my follow-up question senator mccain. How much money did you ask him for for your?
[03:24:30.700 --> 03:24:37.340]  republican institute a front organization that legally can take foreign funds unlike your
[03:24:38.300 --> 03:24:39.580]  presidential campaign
[03:24:39.580 --> 03:24:48.220]  John mccain was in bed with vladimir putin john mccain was the republican candidate for president colluding with the russians
[03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:52.780]  john mccain should be ashamed of himself
[03:24:53.820 --> 03:24:57.420]  now, uh, let me turn to the controversy that
[03:24:58.060 --> 03:25:06.220]  Has dominated the news today and that is a claim that president donald trump has not reached out to the
[03:25:06.220 --> 03:25:12.700]  Families of our fallen men and women who die in the line of combat
[03:25:13.420 --> 03:25:19.820]  Uh, this is uh, a uh manifestation in all honesty of sloppy
[03:25:20.460 --> 03:25:25.580]  Staff work by general john kelly the white house chief of staff
[03:25:26.140 --> 03:25:31.100]  I have confirmed that president trump has either written to or called
[03:25:31.100 --> 03:25:35.580]  the parents and families of every fallen soldier
[03:25:36.300 --> 03:25:40.140]  That whose information has reached the president's desk
[03:25:41.260 --> 03:25:42.700]  meaning any
[03:25:42.700 --> 03:25:49.180]  Service man or woman whose family did not get proper respects paid by the president of the united states
[03:25:49.500 --> 03:25:57.340]  Did not do so because of a failure by general kelly to provide the president with that information
[03:25:57.340 --> 03:26:06.940]  General kelly is supposed to be well. I'm the source of all information and now we have a smear by uh congresswoman
[03:26:07.340 --> 03:26:15.180]  fred rica wilson a black radical from florida who claims that the president told a floridian widow
[03:26:15.580 --> 03:26:19.740]  Of a service man. Well your husband knew what he signed up for
[03:26:19.740 --> 03:26:27.020]  The president never said that and congresswoman you look stupid in that cowboy hat
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:31.900]  Congressman from south florida don't wear cowboy hats
[03:26:32.540 --> 03:26:35.660]  It was stupid looking when you wore it in the state senate
[03:26:36.060 --> 03:26:41.660]  It's stupid looking when you wear it in the house lose the cowboy hat. Will you please?
[03:26:41.660 --> 03:26:51.340]  So, uh, this again is the media seeking to distract from the big news the big news the obama administration
[03:26:52.380 --> 03:26:57.820]  knew about had proof of payoffs by the russian nuclear industry
[03:26:58.300 --> 03:27:00.300]  A massive
[03:27:00.300 --> 03:27:03.900]  145 million dollar payoffs to the clinton foundation
[03:27:03.900 --> 03:27:12.620]  A half million dollar payoff to former president bill clinton in order to get hillary clinton to approve
[03:27:13.180 --> 03:27:19.900]  the uh transfer of the control of 20 percent of the enriched uranium in the united states
[03:27:20.300 --> 03:27:24.460]  To the russians a company controlled by the russian state
[03:27:25.180 --> 03:27:31.260]  James comey knew robert muhler both former fbi directors. They both knew
[03:27:31.260 --> 03:27:38.780]  Attorney general pardon me then u.s. Attorney rod rozenstein knew deputy fbi director
[03:27:39.260 --> 03:27:41.260]  andrew mccabe knew
[03:27:41.580 --> 03:27:49.820]  But no one was informed on the private seas investment board that had to approve transfer of the uranium control
[03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:55.980]  Attorney general eric holder sits on that board. He was certainly aware
[03:27:55.980 --> 03:28:04.780]  But he raised no objection to the transfer of this valuable strategic material to the russians
[03:28:05.740 --> 03:28:09.100]  So what does the mainstream media do? Ah simple
[03:28:09.580 --> 03:28:14.860]  We change the subject you will not get reporting like this anywhere else
[03:28:15.340 --> 03:28:22.300]  On the net or in the mainstream media, which is why I implore you to get to the info wars.com

[03:33:54.300 --> 03:34:00.540]  Who is the pastor of the harvest praise and worship center in easily south carolina?
[03:34:00.540 --> 03:34:07.660]  Uh pastor burns was labeled by time magazine as donald trump's top pastor
[03:34:07.740 --> 03:34:14.380]  He was named by one of the 16 people who helped shape the 2016 presidential election by
[03:34:14.940 --> 03:34:16.940]  yahoo news
[03:34:17.180 --> 03:34:20.860]  And he has been an outspoken defender
[03:34:21.660 --> 03:34:29.100]  Of president donald trump now many many people have been talking about the prospect of getting
[03:34:29.100 --> 03:34:33.580]  My friend pastor mark burns to run for public office
[03:34:33.980 --> 03:34:37.580]  Some speak about his running for lieutenant governor others
[03:34:37.900 --> 03:34:41.580]  Say he'd make a great secretary of state or state controller
[03:34:41.820 --> 03:34:44.300]  Still others are urging him to challenge
[03:34:44.860 --> 03:34:45.900]  rhino
[03:34:45.900 --> 03:34:47.500]  lindsay graham
[03:34:47.500 --> 03:34:53.580]  Down the road, but here's what people don't know and that is that mark burns started
[03:34:53.580 --> 03:35:01.420]  By playing the keyboards and singing gospel music with a family group the burns brothers of belton south carolina
[03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:03.100]  Now i for one
[03:35:03.100 --> 03:35:10.620]  Believe it's time for somebody in the united states senate who can really rock out and i think that's mark burns
[03:35:10.700 --> 03:35:16.060]  Welcome to info wars pastor burns. Thanks for having me roger. I love that intro
[03:35:16.060 --> 03:35:24.620]  Well, uh, this is uh, uh, I think uh important. I tweeted the other day that you were even casually considering
[03:35:25.100 --> 03:35:29.180]  uh public office and that many many south carolina republicans have
[03:35:29.820 --> 03:35:31.820]  openly urged you to challenge
[03:35:32.060 --> 03:35:34.060]  lindsay graham who has been a
[03:35:34.380 --> 03:35:43.100]  Thorn in the side of our president kind of the sancho panza to john mccain king of the rhinos
[03:35:43.100 --> 03:35:50.620]  Uh, we all wish senator mccain. Well with his health problems, but I had no idea after I
[03:35:51.180 --> 03:35:54.540]  Tweeted this the firestorm it would engender
[03:35:55.020 --> 03:35:58.860]  I've learned that you have many many friends and admirers
[03:35:59.500 --> 03:36:02.860]  In south carolina both republican and democrat
[03:36:03.180 --> 03:36:07.980]  And I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that you have been willing to stand up and say things that
[03:36:07.980 --> 03:36:15.180]  No one else is willing to say particularly on the issues of the confederate statutes and our heritage
[03:36:15.660 --> 03:36:19.900]  So, uh, why is it that many people seem to be flocking to your standard?
[03:36:20.860 --> 03:36:23.900]  well, you know roger again people are tired of
[03:36:24.460 --> 03:36:25.180]  um
[03:36:25.180 --> 03:36:33.100]  People saying one thing and doing another people are tired of identity politics people are tired of this race war and
[03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:40.940]  These false accusations of oppression from you know the department of justice people really just want the truth
[03:36:41.020 --> 03:36:44.220]  This attack on the confederate statutes
[03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:50.380]  Will you know pulling the statue down with at not one dollar to a black person's bank account?
[03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:52.940]  And this is what donald trump gets he understands
[03:36:53.180 --> 03:36:56.460]  I'm not going to focus on the fruit of the problem
[03:36:56.460 --> 03:37:03.100]  Which is race wars identity politics led by the delimbs liberals and the democrats
[03:37:03.260 --> 03:37:08.140]  But i'm going to deal with the roots of the problem, which is a lack of jobs
[03:37:08.780 --> 03:37:10.780]  And donald trump understands that
[03:37:11.180 --> 03:37:16.780]  Now it seems to me the entire argument about these statues is an argument about the past
[03:37:16.940 --> 03:37:19.180]  I'm more interested in the future
[03:37:19.660 --> 03:37:21.100]  Uh, all of the black
[03:37:21.100 --> 03:37:28.700]  Black people I know they're interested in economic opportunity. They're interested in safer and better schools
[03:37:29.020 --> 03:37:32.860]  They're interested in living in safer and more secure neighborhoods
[03:37:33.500 --> 03:37:37.420]  Everybody I know in that community wants their piece of the american pie
[03:37:37.900 --> 03:37:40.860]  Uh, they don't want to argue about things that happened a hundred years ago
[03:37:41.420 --> 03:37:47.260]  To me, I think it I think it disrespects abraham lincoln dr. Martin luther king
[03:37:47.260 --> 03:37:55.660]  Uh adam clayton powell jr. Malcolm x these men led and they've made progress. No, we are not perfect
[03:37:56.060 --> 03:38:00.300]  But we are making progress and I think you have said these kinds of things
[03:38:00.620 --> 03:38:03.020]  I think it's why many people are rallying to you
[03:38:03.740 --> 03:38:07.420]  Well, you know, it's not about protests. We got to get out of the protest mindset
[03:38:07.740 --> 03:38:15.260]  We got to get out of protest and we got to focus on progress. How do we move forward again focusing on statues focusing on
[03:38:15.260 --> 03:38:18.780]  The confederate movement back a hundred years ago
[03:38:19.420 --> 03:38:23.660]  It changes nothing for us to date. It is not about
[03:38:24.300 --> 03:38:28.380]  Silver rights to date. It's about economic rights again
[03:38:29.100 --> 03:38:34.220]  Poverty knows no color. You know, what's happening in poor black communities?
[03:38:34.540 --> 03:38:42.780]  Um, our half is happening also in poor white communities and the goal is we've got to focus on the real issues which is jobs
[03:38:42.780 --> 03:38:47.980]  changing the focus on this racial divide that is not bringing us together
[03:38:48.300 --> 03:38:53.100]  And start really dealing with the issues that's going to change all american lives in our country
[03:38:53.260 --> 03:38:58.380]  Again, as long as we're focusing on the on the protests, nothing will never change progress
[03:38:58.540 --> 03:39:02.700]  How do we move forward? How do we work together and how do we bring our arms hand to hand together?
[03:39:02.780 --> 03:39:06.780]  And that's that that that's the movement that's taking place and and you're right roger
[03:39:06.780 --> 03:39:13.820]  I'm just drawn away about in the flatter of the so many people around the country that is saying pastor
[03:39:13.900 --> 03:39:20.220]  You need to run against uh, Lindsey Graham again. I'm so flattered. My number one focus right now
[03:39:20.860 --> 03:39:22.860]  Is to just do what you said
[03:39:23.260 --> 03:39:29.260]  Focus on the real issues that are plaguing our communities asking their communities and guess what black people don't want to hand out
[03:39:29.900 --> 03:39:35.420]  They don't want to they want to hand up. They want opportunities. Uh, they want a chance to say listen
[03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:39.900]  I did this because I'm a hard worker like dr. King. You're not going to judge me
[03:39:40.140 --> 03:39:44.380]  They saw the color of my skin, but by the content of my character
[03:39:44.780 --> 03:39:50.460]  Um, and so people are tired of these identity politics and they want real people who are going to stand up just like
[03:39:50.540 --> 03:39:55.420]  Donald trump and just like hearing mcmaster the governor of this great state of sarkarana
[03:39:55.500 --> 03:39:59.580]  I'm really adamant and i'm focused on helping elect
[03:39:59.580 --> 03:40:05.900]  Uh, the current in comic governor governor mcmasters to continue to carry towards the south carolina
[03:40:06.300 --> 03:40:10.460]  Well, I saw that both you and the president endorsed henry mcmaster
[03:40:10.540 --> 03:40:13.100]  I have of course known the governor back to his days as a
[03:40:13.500 --> 03:40:14.940]  us attorney
[03:40:14.940 --> 03:40:20.860]  He is most definitely the right man for that job and the man to leave south carolina forward
[03:40:20.940 --> 03:40:27.580]  Uh, I hope he selects a lieutenant governor candidate who can help him in the african american community
[03:40:27.580 --> 03:40:32.860]  And yes, I do have somebody in mind who I think meets that criteria
[03:40:33.260 --> 03:40:35.420]  I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here, but
[03:40:35.900 --> 03:40:39.020]  lindsay graham, that's three and a half years away
[03:40:39.660 --> 03:40:45.100]  Uh, whereas there are statewide races, uh in south carolina in 18
[03:40:45.660 --> 03:40:51.900]  Um, I do see the president's endorsement for henry mcmaster as being very valuable and pivotal
[03:40:51.900 --> 03:40:57.900]  Some people said well, it's it's like alabama where the fella he endorsed failed. No, actually
[03:40:57.900 --> 03:41:04.460]  I don't think so at all because luther strange was never a true blue trump supporter whereas henry mcmaster
[03:41:04.940 --> 03:41:10.220]  Supports the president's program for reform in washington as you do
[03:41:10.940 --> 03:41:14.700]  I'm glad I do want to mention uh that uh people can
[03:41:14.700 --> 03:41:21.260]  Reach out to you at burns uh hashtag burns five four two four four
[03:41:21.980 --> 03:41:29.100]  If you want to get in touch with pastor burns and help in his movement to make both south carolina
[03:41:29.500 --> 03:41:34.780]  And america great again when it comes to race issues when it comes to economic issues
[03:41:34.860 --> 03:41:40.380]  This man speaks the truth. He speaks to me. That's why I have been impressed
[03:41:40.380 --> 03:41:45.980]  By the number of people that are urging him to step forward. It's a sacrifice folks
[03:41:46.620 --> 03:41:52.940]  Don't think that donald trump ran for president because he needed to be somebody. He was already somebody
[03:41:53.340 --> 03:41:58.940]  Pastor mark burns is already somebody. He's already having an impact on his community
[03:41:59.100 --> 03:42:03.500]  It would be a burden a sacrifice to run for public office
[03:42:03.580 --> 03:42:08.540]  But leaders must lead and if folks like mark burns don't step forward
[03:42:08.540 --> 03:42:11.100]  Then we are stuck with the status quo
[03:42:11.500 --> 03:42:16.060]  We're gonna have mark burns back here on the info wars to chart his progress
[03:42:16.140 --> 03:42:19.420]  But pastor i'm honored that you could join us today

[03:44:54.380 --> 03:44:57.740]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry
[03:44:57.980 --> 03:45:05.260]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense
[03:45:05.260 --> 03:45:11.180]  Sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[03:45:11.260 --> 03:45:18.540]  They had drums of their own air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[03:45:18.860 --> 03:45:23.580]  Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our
[03:45:23.660 --> 03:45:30.940]  Votality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with

[03:46:52.060 --> 03:46:57.660]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:13.420 --> 03:47:16.940]  This is bernie sanders and there's a lot of corruption in this country
[03:47:16.940 --> 03:47:23.020]  And if you want to hear about corruption, then you'll listen to robson stone on info wars those details are true
[03:47:28.940 --> 03:47:34.780]  This is vintage rolling stones a piece written by chuck berry called carol
[03:47:35.260 --> 03:47:39.980]  A one of the legendary covers by the stones in the 1960s
[03:47:40.940 --> 03:47:46.060]  As we said in the first segment we have learned that the nazi collaborator
[03:47:46.060 --> 03:47:48.620]  And a far left troublemaker
[03:47:49.260 --> 03:47:58.220]  George soros the man who wiki leaks revealed paid for the fomenting of violence at donald trump's campaign rallies
[03:47:58.700 --> 03:48:05.740]  The man who is paying for the phony lawsuit by protect democracy that accuses me
[03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:09.180]  completely falsely and without evidence of having
[03:48:09.180 --> 03:48:16.300]  Colluded with the russians to hack the dnc and give the information
[03:48:16.780 --> 03:48:27.900]  To julian assange of wiki leaks a stone cold lie a falsehood a myth a fairytale a steaming plate of horse
[03:48:28.460 --> 03:48:35.660]  Pucky that has been served up by the democrats in the house and senate intelligence committee mr
[03:48:35.660 --> 03:48:41.660]  Soros has taken majority control of the dinosaur barbecue
[03:48:42.220 --> 03:48:45.100]  Chain in the northeastern united states now
[03:48:45.820 --> 03:48:52.300]  This is a tragedy thanks to jonathan tillov of the austin american statesman
[03:48:52.780 --> 03:48:53.820]  i've had
[03:48:53.820 --> 03:49:00.620]  The privilege to have some of the finest barbecue in austin texas austin for those of you don't know it
[03:49:00.620 --> 03:49:11.980]  But is the barbecue capital of the world there is no better barbecue anywhere on the face of the planet sorry you north carolinians
[03:49:12.780 --> 03:49:17.260]  But i must admit dinosaur was a go-to favorite
[03:49:18.140 --> 03:49:25.340]  They have a location in harlem new york not far from my place i live between frederick douglas and
[03:49:25.820 --> 03:49:28.860]  adam clayton powell junior boulevards
[03:49:28.860 --> 03:49:36.140]  When in new york uh and their locations baltimore brooklyn buffalo where it all started
[03:49:36.860 --> 03:49:43.740]  Newark rochester stanford connecticut syracuse new york and troit new york this is a pity
[03:49:44.380 --> 03:49:50.620]  Folks i'm imploring you boycott soros boycott dinosaur goodbye
[03:49:51.340 --> 03:49:56.860]  dino we're not giving our money to a nazi collaborator who is
[03:49:56.860 --> 03:50:02.620]  Fomenting violence in the united states. We know who paid for the phony
[03:50:03.740 --> 03:50:05.740]  Violence in charlotte'sville
[03:50:06.380 --> 03:50:09.900]  We could tell a false flag operation when this fellow
[03:50:10.460 --> 03:50:17.260]  Kessler who is suddenly a white supremacist admits that only a year ago. He was an obama backer
[03:50:17.820 --> 03:50:25.340]  Doing demonstrations and violence on behalf of octupi doesn't sound like a right winger to me
[03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:28.700]  It sounds to me like a false flag. So
[03:50:29.820 --> 03:50:37.020]  Folks join me on this boycott. Let's inflict a little bit of pain on mr. Soros
[03:50:37.900 --> 03:50:41.100]  The other issue that comes before us today
[03:50:41.980 --> 03:50:47.980]  Is the entire question of the cover-up and what will happen next now
[03:50:47.980 --> 03:50:55.340]  John solomon of the hill sarah carter of cirka news and our friend shone hannity
[03:50:55.900 --> 03:51:03.900]  Breaking enormous news yesterday. We previewed it here on info wars as early as yesterday morning
[03:51:04.780 --> 03:51:10.620]  What we have caught is a massive bribery plot where the obama administration
[03:51:11.340 --> 03:51:16.380]  The fbi the justice department were well known known to them that there were
[03:51:16.380 --> 03:51:19.740]  a massive million dollar bribes by
[03:51:20.540 --> 03:51:25.900]  By the russians that there was a hundred and forty five million dollars
[03:51:26.380 --> 03:51:31.900]  Funneled to the clinton foundation that there was a another half million dollars
[03:51:32.380 --> 03:51:39.180]  Given to former president bill clinton to ensure the transfer of our technology
[03:51:39.180 --> 03:51:49.260]  And who led this investigation why it was for at first fbi director robert muller then under fbi director james comey
[03:51:49.820 --> 03:51:57.500]  All under assistant fbi director andrew mccabe and directed by none other than then u.s. Attorney rod
[03:51:58.140 --> 03:52:00.140]  rosinstein these are the very men
[03:52:00.780 --> 03:52:08.060]  Who have set up president donald trump for the coup in which rosin stein on nobody's authority
[03:52:08.060 --> 03:52:10.060]  appointed muller
[03:52:10.220 --> 03:52:17.740]  To investigate a non-crime to find a crime. You see folks special counsel special prosecutors
[03:52:18.940 --> 03:52:23.260]  Are normally appointed when there's evidence of a crime
[03:52:23.820 --> 03:52:28.780]  And the justice department for some reason has a conflict of interest
[03:52:29.420 --> 03:52:33.020]  In this case mr. Rosinstein appointed mr. Mueller
[03:52:33.820 --> 03:52:36.220]  When there was no evidence of a crime
[03:52:36.220 --> 03:52:40.620]  There are two separate questions here, and they're important
[03:52:41.180 --> 03:52:45.420]  One is the question of whether the russians sought to effect our election
[03:52:45.980 --> 03:52:50.460]  Through some poorly written and badly targeted facebook ads
[03:52:51.020 --> 03:52:54.780]  The answer appears to be yes, then there is the question of whether
[03:52:55.180 --> 03:52:58.860]  Donald trump or trump associates or trump family members
[03:52:59.340 --> 03:53:03.900]  Or trump campaign ads or trump friends of many years standing
[03:53:03.900 --> 03:53:10.780]  Colluded coordinated or conspired with the russians to help elect donald trump
[03:53:11.500 --> 03:53:13.500]  And there is to this day
[03:53:13.900 --> 03:53:19.820]  Not a scintilla of evidence not an iota of evidence that that was the case
[03:53:21.420 --> 03:53:28.940]  The senator from north carolina former use car dealer richard bur was forced to come out and said well so far
[03:53:29.100 --> 03:53:31.100]  We have no evidence
[03:53:31.100 --> 03:53:36.780]  And then congressman adam schiff the ranking democrat on the
[03:53:37.580 --> 03:53:43.100]  House committee who stunningly claimed in the hearing in which i participated
[03:53:43.500 --> 03:53:49.980]  That the fbi was allowed to examine the server of the dnc
[03:53:50.860 --> 03:53:53.820]  backed up by congresswoman jackie spear
[03:53:53.820 --> 03:54:01.580]  And vigorously contested by congressman trey gowdy who pointed out that james
[03:54:02.220 --> 03:54:04.220]  Comey and
[03:54:04.780 --> 03:54:09.420]  secretary johnson both sat before the intelligence committee and swore under oath
[03:54:10.300 --> 03:54:18.700]  That the dnc did not let the fbi examine their servers to see if there ever was really a hack
[03:54:18.700 --> 03:54:25.660]  So i think it's incumbent on congressman schiff and congressman spire to clarify
[03:54:26.300 --> 03:54:33.260]  Their comments if they know something we don't know they have some obligation to tell the american people
[03:54:33.820 --> 03:54:35.820]  But the nation magazine piece
[03:54:36.700 --> 03:54:42.300]  Highlighting the veterans of intelligence, uh, like william bennie rey
[03:54:42.300 --> 03:54:49.740]  mcgovern and others who have pointed out that the hard science indicates that the dnc
[03:54:50.620 --> 03:54:52.620]  Was never hacked by anyone
[03:54:53.340 --> 03:55:01.740]  Never mind the russians that this narrative was invented by john pedesta and the democrats to distract
[03:55:02.140 --> 03:55:08.460]  From what we now know from yesterday's disclosures was a million dollar scam
[03:55:08.460 --> 03:55:18.620]  To have the russians line the pockets of the clintons in return for control of 20 percent of america's enriched uranium
[03:55:19.900 --> 03:55:22.540]  What we have here folks is a cover-up
[03:55:23.340 --> 03:55:30.940]  My question yesterday was since it was the hill and cirka news and info wars and
[03:55:30.940 --> 03:55:38.940]  Sean hannity making these exposures would the mainstream media pick up this story and do it justice?
[03:55:39.740 --> 03:55:45.900]  Now that senator chuck grasley's senate judiciary committee has launched an open investigation
[03:55:46.460 --> 03:55:48.460]  Into this treachery
[03:55:48.460 --> 03:55:51.980]  It is highly unlikely that a cover-up can be
[03:55:52.700 --> 03:55:53.980]  successful
[03:55:53.980 --> 03:56:00.700]  Folks, this is the kind of breaking news you can only get at info wars, which is why I again ask you
