[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:40.340]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.340 --> 00:44.780]  ladies and gentlemen we got several big guests coming up today we've got former
[00:44.780 --> 00:50.700]  congressman doctor Ron Paul coming on the broadcast and then we have Kurt
[00:50.700 --> 00:54.660]  Haskell who witnessed the federal government getting the underwear bomber
[00:54.660 --> 01:01.820]  on the plane well now we learn that's the Islamists that attacked supposedly
[01:01.820 --> 01:09.380]  over in France they were in the same safe house and trained by the same people
[01:09.380 --> 01:13.820]  and we're all a lucky so to be clear I'm not saying there aren't radical Muslim
[01:13.820 --> 01:17.940]  terrorists I'm not saying that this probably wasn't a real attack I'm
[01:17.940 --> 01:23.060]  saying upstream the West is funding financing and protecting these people so
[01:23.060 --> 01:27.620]  that special interest can take our freedoms and I want to open the phones
[01:27.620 --> 01:35.820]  up today and get your take on all of this this is obviously the new big
[01:35.820 --> 01:42.100]  kickoff they've said on the news this will never end it's like the war on
[01:42.100 --> 01:45.660]  drugs you're ready to give up all your liberties ISIS is going to be attacking
[01:45.660 --> 01:52.940]  America MI6 CIA they're all saying it why it's metastasized it's spread it's all
[01:52.940 --> 01:56.540]  over we can't stop it
[01:56.900 --> 02:02.460]  France deployed 10,000 troops on the streets checkpoints everywhere for three
[02:02.460 --> 02:09.020]  punks who went to Al Qaeda training camps in Yemen and now the girlfriend has
[02:09.020 --> 02:15.460]  run through Turkey to Syria where our government and other governments in the
[02:15.460 --> 02:20.060]  West have given tens of billions of dollars the last four plus years to these
[02:20.060 --> 02:27.860]  very groups to run around doing to Syria what was done in Paris on a scale of
[02:27.860 --> 02:32.860]  if they've killed over 300,000 people that's a number about a year old it's
[02:32.860 --> 02:36.800]  slowed down somebody it's close to 350,000 people killed most of them
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.620]  civilians by Al Qaeda and affiliated ISIS scumbag formations out of Saudi
[02:42.620 --> 02:46.780]  Arabia that's his quarterbacking and funding the whole deal well more than
[02:46.780 --> 02:51.140]  quarterbacking it's kind of the back office if you use a football analogy or
[02:51.140 --> 03:01.980]  baseball analogy 30 what's 350,000 divided by 20 can you guys do that and
[03:01.980 --> 03:10.500]  that's how many times bigger the ISIS Al Qaeda bloodbath has been for Syria alone
[03:10.500 --> 03:15.660]  over a hundred thousand last numbers we've gotten since Al Qaeda liberated
[03:15.660 --> 03:20.740]  with Western backing Libya and now they're taking their time killing all the
[03:20.740 --> 03:25.780]  non-radical Muslims all the Alawites any Christians they can get their mittens
[03:25.780 --> 03:35.940]  on Alex we have that number we have the number yes sir 17,500 so 17,500 times we
[03:35.940 --> 03:40.820]  need to do a story on that numbers very 250,000 300,000 but you had it all
[03:40.820 --> 03:44.380]  together it's over 300,000 on average have died in the four and a half year
[03:44.380 --> 03:51.100]  quote civil war started by the West and backed by the West 17,000 times more
[03:51.100 --> 03:57.500]  people plus if you divide 20 and a 350,000
[03:59.060 --> 04:05.100]  think about that 17,000 plus times as many people as died in France you would
[04:05.100 --> 04:09.980]  think it was the end of the world what happened in France you would think that
[04:09.980 --> 04:13.980]  flying saucers landed and blow up every major city how big the story is I'm
[04:13.980 --> 04:19.700]  sad 20 people are dead that many people died in a couple hours yesterday on U.S.
[04:19.700 --> 04:26.220]  highways and then media gets and the government is to act like it's for a

[08:23.340 --> 08:26.100]  down the World Trade Center
[08:26.620 --> 08:33.020]  does anybody else see a problem here if the government has nothing to hide are
[08:33.020 --> 08:39.380]  they so afraid to answer a few questions this story does not end up
[08:39.380 --> 08:54.580]  we're on a mission
[08:54.580 --> 09:13.100]  that's ministry exposing false flag stage chair bringing a scene lies lies lies
[09:13.100 --> 09:20.220]  lies lies lies remember back in the late 80s they came out with that album with
[09:20.220 --> 09:26.460]  the New World Order exposing the New World Order Al Jorgensen of ministry
[09:26.460 --> 09:32.340]  who is a fellow Austin I also lives down in El Paso part of the year we need to
[09:32.340 --> 09:39.460]  get him in studio sometime I'll give Al of ministry fame a call one more
[09:39.460 --> 09:46.500]  musician awake to what's going on in the world well ladies and gentlemen we are
[09:46.500 --> 09:54.780]  broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday the 13th day of January 2015 worldwide
[09:54.780 --> 09:59.140]  broadcast and we have been somewhat distracted even though it's been an
[09:59.140 --> 10:06.060]  important story with the attacks in Paris because it is a true life bloody soap
[10:06.060 --> 10:12.420]  opera our hearts go out to the 20 dead and through this Rosetta Stone the
[10:12.420 --> 10:18.100]  skeleton key this decoder ring of looking at how the media presents the
[10:18.100 --> 10:22.940]  official story and how it's now unraveled it shows us the rest of the
[10:22.940 --> 10:30.820]  story so even globalist propaganda can be deciphered as a teaching tool to show
[10:30.820 --> 10:36.740]  folks how the cow ate the cabbage but I'm not gonna spend too much time on that
[10:36.740 --> 10:40.020]  today I'm sure callers I want to talk about it we have former congressman
[10:40.020 --> 10:44.060]  Ron Paul joining us and we have another whistleblower guest who witnessed the
[10:44.060 --> 10:48.460]  stage terror attack and I was then proven correct in Congress that indeed
[10:48.460 --> 10:53.980]  was a pretty much staged event Kurt Haskell the lawyer will be joining us
[10:53.980 --> 11:02.700]  from Michigan from Detroit now we covered this yesterday that the pair of
[11:02.700 --> 11:06.820]  shooters trained with the underwear bomber Patsy that's how long they've
[11:06.820 --> 11:13.020]  been training with Al Qaeda at least five years five years you heard me
[11:13.020 --> 11:17.500]  right and we're allowed to travel in and out of the country and post terrorist
[11:17.500 --> 11:23.740]  training videos on Facebook and no one stops them but we need new cyber
[11:23.740 --> 11:27.700]  security laws passed that they're now introducing to get rid of free speech
[11:27.700 --> 11:32.780]  legalized in essay spying that's illegal right now Europe's announcing the same
[11:32.780 --> 11:36.980]  thing we need more militarized police ten thousand troops on the streets of
[11:36.980 --> 11:41.780]  France the US sending advisors on how to properly make it look like occupied
[11:41.780 --> 11:50.740]  France from 1940 1941 that's the answer don't control the borders don't arrest
[11:50.740 --> 11:54.700]  people when they clearly are training at Al Qaeda training camps and around no
[11:54.700 --> 12:00.700]  fly list keep letting them fly in and out just like they did with Major Hassan
[12:00.700 --> 12:04.900]  controlled by and we're all a lockie the four-head shooter just like he
[12:04.900 --> 12:09.340]  controlled the underwear bomber just like he controlled these guys these
[12:09.340 --> 12:14.940]  latest scumbags and then a lockie it's come out in the Associated Press and
[12:14.940 --> 12:18.340]  Lennon Guardian and Colonel Shaffers talked about it on air in fact just cue
[12:18.340 --> 12:27.100]  that back up please and it came out congressional testimony and that and
[12:27.100 --> 12:35.540]  we're all a lockie is a double triple agent of MI6 CIA and Al Qaeda and they
[12:35.540 --> 12:41.460]  said oh he was a triple agent he he snuck up on us no he handles all these
[12:41.460 --> 12:47.700]  people and then they allow the attacks to take place Major Hassan was a out of
[12:47.700 --> 12:53.620]  his mind killer and was a real terrorist but he was handled and manipulated
[12:53.620 --> 12:59.180]  by a globalist controller and we're all lucky same thing with these three
[12:59.180 --> 13:03.740]  scumbags in France same thing with the drugged up underwear bomber and a bunch
[13:03.740 --> 13:09.820]  of other patsies that a lockie handles so we have that and we know our government
[13:09.820 --> 13:13.140]  otherwise our governments have given over ten billion dollars the last four
[13:13.140 --> 13:19.220]  and a half years that we know about it's two billion just last year from the US
[13:19.220 --> 13:25.060]  alone so I say 10 billion I guess that's wrong that's US numbers I haven't
[13:25.060 --> 13:28.740]  added up all the other countries France was the other big contributor Saudi
[13:28.740 --> 13:32.340]  Arabia is the secret contributor and contributes the coordination that's
[13:32.340 --> 13:40.060]  come out to kill 17,000 times we did the math earlier what was the exact number
[13:40.060 --> 13:45.940]  if you divide 20 dead French into 350,000 dead Syrians most of them
[13:45.940 --> 13:50.060]  civilians killed by al-Qaeda and ISIS groups
[13:50.060 --> 13:57.700]  Boko Haram in in Africa al-Qaeda flag same group but in Syria 300 plus thousand
[13:57.700 --> 14:05.660]  if you divide 20 into that it's 17,000 plus times
[14:06.380 --> 14:12.980]  17 and a half thousand times more people have been killed in four and a half
[14:12.980 --> 14:23.180]  years Western backed paid for by US taxpayers Turkish taxpayers French
[14:23.180 --> 14:35.380]  taxpayers advised by our military 17,500 times more people and change have
[14:35.380 --> 14:39.940]  died are there going to be any marches for them no are they going to be
[14:39.940 --> 14:44.780]  catalyzed visuals no is there going to be any news coverage no only two years
[14:44.780 --> 14:49.660]  ago when thousands of officers commissioned and non-commissioned held
[14:49.660 --> 14:54.580]  up over their faces and their name tags computer printouts saying I will not
[14:54.580 --> 15:01.580]  fight or hand-drawn I will not fight in Syria for al-Qaeda and a lot of said

[15:32.780 --> 15:43.580]  yesterday I'm starting in with it again because the military gets it this is
[15:43.580 --> 15:50.380]  the reality of what's going on because our military's been over there they
[15:50.380 --> 15:55.420]  fought these people they know the players and they are really freaked out
[15:55.420 --> 16:03.020]  about it look up some of the signs I will not fight against I will not fight
[16:03.020 --> 16:09.260]  in Syria for al-Qaeda day oppressor Libre free the oppressed that's a green
[16:09.260 --> 16:13.620]  beret slogan info wars if you scroll back up I mean look at what the officers
[16:13.620 --> 16:17.420]  are saying there wake up people go back to one this is wake up I want to read
[16:17.420 --> 16:24.580]  that to viewers and listeners Obama I will not deploy to fight for your al-Qaeda
[16:24.580 --> 16:29.740]  rebels in Syria wake up people and the Pentagon Intel that was presented to
[16:29.740 --> 16:36.660]  Congress two years ago was 75% is al-Qaeda actual brigades trained in Saudi
[16:36.660 --> 16:43.180]  Arabia and Yemen and other areas as of late last year just two years ago it
[16:43.180 --> 16:49.620]  was that as of late last year so I keep forgetting it's 2015 now it was 95%
[16:49.620 --> 16:54.020]  were al-Qaeda they have killed or displaced any rebels that were not
[16:54.020 --> 17:01.420]  complete blood thirsty out of their mind scum so now as of two weeks ago the
[17:01.420 --> 17:06.460]  Iraqi president came out and said you continue to daily air drops to al-Qaeda
[17:06.460 --> 17:12.180]  10 miles off target battling the Kurds you are giving al-Qaeda weapons on
[17:12.180 --> 17:16.340]  purpose we're not stupid and they released videos and photos shot by the
[17:16.340 --> 17:22.700]  Iraqi military trained by our military of al-Qaeda getting the weapons so there
[17:22.700 --> 17:29.820]  Obama is continuing air drops to al-Qaeda right now I mean you cannot make
[17:29.820 --> 17:36.780]  this stuff up I cannot believe this myself this is so over the top there it
[17:36.780 --> 17:42.780]  is ISIS video America's airdrop weapons now in our hands
[17:42.780 --> 17:46.220]  well that's because our troops will no longer land on the ground and give it to
[17:46.220 --> 17:55.900]  them they've refused they will no longer do it and that really upsets the power
[17:55.900 --> 17:59.900]  structure because they want our military compartmentalized so that said I
[17:59.900 --> 18:03.340]  want to hear from listeners about this because we've been predicting a big
[18:03.340 --> 18:07.940]  Pearl Harbor false flag or a group of false flags in the entertainment
[18:07.940 --> 18:11.700]  industry and against the Pentagon and others to sell in Congress the idea of
[18:11.700 --> 18:17.500]  SOPA and international treaties SOPA and SISPA and the Cyber Security Act that
[18:17.500 --> 18:24.580]  legalizes all this currently illegal NSA spine I don't believe for a minute
[18:24.580 --> 18:29.580]  that ISIS who are a bunch of spoiled rotten 25 year old thugs on average who
[18:29.580 --> 18:32.820]  want to you know they don't want to join the army to prove they're a man of the
[18:32.820 --> 18:37.620]  Marines so they go join al-Qaeda they're allowed to fly out they're allowed to
[18:37.620 --> 18:40.700]  leave their countries they're allowed to go back and forth just like the
[18:40.700 --> 18:46.420]  attackers in in France it's real trendy all the cool hip-hop girls want to date
[18:46.420 --> 18:53.340]  them because they're real men that's the way to roll do you really believe ISIS
[18:53.340 --> 19:00.220]  hacked the Pentagon shent com and their Twitter and everything else bull bull
[19:00.220 --> 19:08.740]  bull bull ISIS hack of Pentagon Twitter accounts traced back to Maryland I mean

[25:06.060 --> 25:11.420]  this is what modern feminism has done does this is the trendiness but to speak
[25:11.420 --> 25:15.980]  out against your daughter being put in a slave pit that's not culturally open
[25:15.980 --> 25:21.020]  you know I always love how they say all cultures are equal and all cultures are
[25:21.020 --> 25:27.620]  good but classical Western culture it's bad it's got to be overturned well no
[25:27.620 --> 25:31.980]  I think the Aztec culture sacrificing 10,000 people on a lunar eclipse and
[25:31.980 --> 25:37.060]  killing all the neighboring tribes to supply slaves and the main source of
[25:37.060 --> 25:42.380]  meat for the priest class was the dead bodies chalk mule got the heart and
[25:42.380 --> 25:48.220]  things like that but they would hang the bodies up down in the market and then
[25:48.220 --> 25:53.940]  sell the human flesh as the main meat I think that was a pretty sick culture of
[25:53.940 --> 25:58.460]  the Aztecs that degenerated the Mayans when the Mayans at one period would
[25:58.460 --> 26:02.180]  like sacrifice a couple people a year I'm not saying that's good but it was
[26:02.180 --> 26:07.620]  done to the priest class themselves then it degenerated down into the Aztecs who
[26:07.620 --> 26:10.940]  were ready to collapse the entire culture by the time Cortez showed up with a
[26:10.940 --> 26:15.100]  couple hundred men and took over millions about three million people were
[26:15.100 --> 26:19.220]  down there and a couple hundred guys conquered them with disease and other
[26:19.220 --> 26:27.100]  things but the point I'm getting at is radical Islam is taking over Islam you
[26:27.100 --> 26:32.860]  can't debate that it's taking over bullying because moderates it's like
[26:32.860 --> 26:37.060]  the moderate Americans libertarians the average American in major studies is
[26:37.060 --> 26:40.860]  libertarian that's pretty much agreed to you can look it up I'm there even the
[26:40.860 --> 26:43.380]  financial times of London and said libertarianism is sweeping the world
[26:43.380 --> 26:46.740]  even if you're physically conservative and socially conservative you know
[26:46.740 --> 26:51.780]  you're living let live hey okay live how you want no we're gonna tell you how to
[26:51.780 --> 26:55.700]  live we're gonna teach your kids sexual education one or six we're gonna give
[26:55.700 --> 26:58.860]  them vaccines even if you don't want we're gonna teach your daughters about
[26:58.860 --> 27:04.580]  this and that you're like well that's not tolerant I should go live my life no
[27:04.580 --> 27:07.780]  no no no you understand this is a one-way street you don't tell us how to
[27:07.780 --> 27:14.700]  live we tell you how to live and so because we don't have any defense and
[27:14.700 --> 27:21.180]  we just lay down to whoever bosses us around we have no culture the NFL and
[27:21.180 --> 27:31.180]  the NBA and the NHL is not a culture men I mean who are you what do you stand
[27:31.180 --> 27:35.980]  for Al Qaeda stands for something the globalists that are setting up a
[27:35.980 --> 27:40.420]  worldwide eugenics platform they have an agenda they stand for something and
[27:40.420 --> 27:45.700]  why do you think Homeland Security here domestically but also in the EU why
[27:45.700 --> 27:52.420]  they're so against Le Pen which is a mild libertarian nationalist French group
[27:52.420 --> 27:58.860]  very classy what why do you think it's so demonized it's like Ron Paul white
[27:58.860 --> 28:05.820]  because it's a culture and any culture can stand up against another culture and
[28:05.820 --> 28:11.420]  if it's a superior culture that creates incredible wealth and architecture and
[28:11.420 --> 28:17.140]  literature and freedom and and and indoor plumbing and electricity and
[28:17.140 --> 28:31.140]  spaceships and classical music how can that be overrun by the worst elements of
[28:31.140 --> 28:36.060]  radical Islam out of Saudi Arabia I mean what a dirtbag government that is
[28:36.060 --> 28:43.660]  it's because we have no culture folks it's been removed we have the NFL in
[28:43.660 --> 28:49.020]  between the vaccine ads and the Prozac ads and the beer ads and being lectured
[28:49.020 --> 28:57.340]  about how great Obamacare is well that can't stand up against Al Qaeda that
[28:57.340 --> 29:05.060]  can't stand up against gangster rap the worst vile mindless scum type garbage is
[29:05.060 --> 29:10.100]  what will come to the top because we have been set up to fail and lay down and
[29:10.100 --> 29:15.540]  die in a ditch but the gangster culture and all that's just to induct our youth
[29:15.540 --> 29:20.980]  into prison system and the whole Al Qaeda threat has been for a clash of
[29:20.980 --> 29:26.540]  civilizations to destabilize the West in the end though the great culture that's
[29:26.540 --> 29:30.780]  overriding us is the scientific dictatorship of eugenics and transhumanism
[29:30.780 --> 29:34.900]  that has already announced the end of humanity the end of the age of man and
[29:34.900 --> 29:40.300]  the rise of humans merging with machines so I'm just here to let you know what's
[29:40.300 --> 29:44.020]  going on and that you might want to rally against it and get informed on it

[33:18.860 --> 33:26.460]  I went over the phones up specifically on the big cyber attacks but on the

[33:33.940 --> 33:37.780]  Paris attacks we now know it leads back to the same globalist controlled and
[33:37.780 --> 33:43.100]  we're all a locky who always basically handles the terrorists that attack and
[33:43.100 --> 33:46.820]  these these attacks never get foiled even though there's a long trail of
[33:46.820 --> 33:51.500]  evidence and every reason to arrest these people prior to the attacks it's
[33:51.500 --> 33:54.500]  being allowed to happen do you disagree with that do you agree with that
[33:54.500 --> 33:58.660]  statement I don't know how you could disagree and then how obvious are all
[33:58.660 --> 34:02.580]  these cyber attacks that they claim North Korea launched I'm no fan of North
[34:02.580 --> 34:07.260]  Korea but they can't even manufacture an automobile only two cities have
[34:07.260 --> 34:12.700]  electricity they have primitive computers North Korea is a joke and then
[34:12.700 --> 34:17.940]  of course it turned out North Korea did not hack Sony it was an inside job well
[34:17.940 --> 34:23.460]  now ISIS hack of Pentagon Twitter accounts traced back to Maryland NSA
[34:23.460 --> 34:27.580]  implicated in latest cybersecurity scare the articles by Paul Joseph Watson on
[34:27.580 --> 34:33.100]  info wars.com according to the group which unifies itself as anonymous the
[34:33.100 --> 34:37.980]  ISIS hack of the Pentagon Twitter accounts traced back to Maryland home of
[34:37.980 --> 34:42.900]  the National Security Agency Twitter and YouTube accounts belong to the US
[34:42.900 --> 34:46.660]  military command that oversees operations the Middle East were reportedly
[34:46.660 --> 34:51.980]  hacked by ISIS sympathizers earlier today with messages being sent out for
[34:51.980 --> 34:56.500]  almost an hour before the accounts temporarily shut down American soldiers
[34:56.500 --> 35:02.460]  we are coming watch your back ISIS the hackers posted on the US Central Command
[35:02.460 --> 35:07.980]  Twitter feed on that first one out yesterday I saw it and read it and
[35:07.980 --> 35:13.300]  misinterpreted it as if shent com was saying we're coming after you so that's
[35:13.300 --> 35:16.500]  a correction and that's the type of mistakes I make because there's no
[35:16.500 --> 35:22.860]  there's no teleprompters here I'm just going off stacks of news even though I'm
[35:22.860 --> 35:27.620]  accurate probably 95% of the time I make mistakes like that and I try to correct
[35:27.620 --> 35:33.660]  them in fact the crew corrected me during the last break I had read these
[35:33.660 --> 35:37.900]  articles yesterday and I was going off memory there's a whole bunch of young
[35:37.900 --> 35:43.260]  women in Europe and in and other countries the United States UK that are
[35:43.260 --> 35:48.420]  traveling and joining the jihad and I had read these articles yesterday and
[35:48.420 --> 35:53.660]  then it said Australia sometimes that word gets in my mind from Austria the
[35:53.660 --> 35:57.860]  country bordering Germany that Hitler came from and it's capital is Vienna I
[35:57.860 --> 36:02.260]  know all about it I'll just make the most ridiculous mistakes sometimes so
[36:02.260 --> 36:07.100]  that's a mistake I made not about the young women getting pregnant and going
[36:07.100 --> 36:13.780]  and joining them here's the headlines pregnant Austrian teens in ISIS we've
[36:13.780 --> 36:19.460]  made a huge mistake to Austrian teens got way more than they bargained for when
[36:19.460 --> 36:22.900]  they abandoned their homes and families to become poster girls for ISIS
[36:22.900 --> 36:29.300]  terrorist that's like wanting to become poster girls for piranhas or something
[36:29.300 --> 36:34.940]  it's just and now they desperately want to come home
[36:35.900 --> 36:41.620]  Samra Kizanovich 17 and her friend
[36:41.620 --> 36:47.500]  Selmovic 15 would love to press the undo button on the last six months during
[36:47.500 --> 36:51.220]  which they traded their comfortable existence in Europe for a life of evil
[36:51.220 --> 36:57.220]  engineered by terrorists and it goes on to show them in Syria from what they
[36:57.220 --> 37:04.180]  look like before to in their jihadi garb working with people that grab small
[37:04.180 --> 37:10.900]  young girls from the families in Syria and shell them into sex slavery and have
[37:10.900 --> 37:16.060]  public auctions of them which of course the feminists say zero about modern
[37:16.060 --> 37:18.700]  feminists just want to dominate women and tell them what to do and be their
[37:18.700 --> 37:23.900]  cultural bosses and then have the women boss the men around well all of you see
[37:23.900 --> 37:27.660]  I a glorious stymies that tell women not to have kids but you got a bunch of kids
[37:27.660 --> 37:34.300]  and you know everything else you can go straight to Hades no one listens to you
[37:34.300 --> 37:40.180]  but idiots every metric every poll shows that the vast majority of women do not
[37:40.180 --> 37:45.620]  identify themselves as feminist you don't represent femininity people don't
[37:45.620 --> 37:50.740]  to go through you the priest class of women to find femininity and feminine
[37:50.740 --> 37:58.460]  power you understand that you lose you fail I don't care how much social
[37:58.460 --> 38:03.380]  engineering you engage in I don't care about how much brainwashing you do to
[38:03.380 --> 38:07.540]  try to break up the family and screw up society folks now know what you've done
[38:07.540 --> 38:16.540]  to the world they know how premeditatedly evil you are and in places that
[38:16.540 --> 38:20.220]  are run by feminist and total liberals this is what the young women revolt
[38:20.220 --> 38:24.820]  against and then go and join something that's the opposite but just as bad or
[38:24.820 --> 38:32.980]  worse and I just cannot believe how on the major universities the sexiest thing
[38:32.980 --> 38:40.780]  out there is radical Islam and this is all being done to destabilize and screw
[38:40.780 --> 38:50.020]  up the country you know we raised our boys to not be men and then women end up
[38:50.020 --> 38:53.820]  going for quote the bad boys the convicts the gangbangers and end up totally
[38:53.820 --> 38:58.780]  unhappy and unfulfilled because good men won't act like men arrest the
[38:58.780 --> 39:04.180]  development playing video games all day the good boys are all the bad boys are
[39:04.180 --> 39:08.140]  out there robbing liquor stores and getting your daughter on heroin and
[39:08.140 --> 39:13.300]  put her on the street men need to start acting like men and stop being
[39:13.300 --> 39:17.700]  politically correct and start taking control of your families or the state
[39:17.700 --> 39:25.260]  will ISIS police quiz teenage girls who tried to flee Austria to become
[39:25.260 --> 39:30.460]  terror brides in Syria so more trying to make their way there to have the fun
[39:30.460 --> 39:37.900]  here's the toll-free number ahead of Ron Paul joining us 800 259 9231 1
[39:37.900 --> 39:46.500]  800 259 9231 and we will get you up and on the air very interesting video it's
[39:46.500 --> 39:51.060]  bleeped out Moroccan born mayor of Rotterdam in the Netherlands tells
[39:51.060 --> 39:54.300]  fellow Muslims who don't appreciate their freedoms of living in the West to
[39:54.300 --> 39:59.860]  pack your bags and get the f out of the country on live television let's queue
[39:59.860 --> 40:04.980]  that up we've got it beeped I really like that perspective I mean here's the
[40:04.980 --> 40:10.860]  deal we can't go to Saudi Arabia and preach the gospel on the street or even
[40:10.860 --> 40:15.140]  hand out Bibles or they will put you in prison for life or execute you and you
[40:15.140 --> 40:20.940]  you won't hear any civil rights movement to crying that it's their culture
[40:20.940 --> 40:25.900]  and if they want to kill you it's fine it's trendy it's liberal
[40:26.220 --> 40:33.500]  free speech though is bad if you say that men should be men and that if a
[40:33.500 --> 40:37.980]  woman wants to do that and have the man wear the pants that's a good thing oh
[40:37.980 --> 40:42.940]  that's evil or all sex is raped between a man and a woman that's just a bunch of
[40:42.940 --> 40:47.820]  feminists that want all the women for themselves and if it of lesbian feminists
[40:47.820 --> 40:51.780]  like women that's their prerogative I'm a libertarian I'm not just just you're
[40:51.780 --> 40:55.900]  not gonna control them all and put them in a harem for yourself I know you want
[40:55.900 --> 40:59.020]  to get them when they're five years old in school and train them up to be you
[40:59.020 --> 41:04.460]  know only like women but I'm sorry you're not gonna get all of them
[41:04.900 --> 41:10.940]  I mean you just want to run pimp gang pimp game ladies I understand the
[41:10.940 --> 41:15.500]  feminists are government pimps and they're pimping they shit up there on
[41:15.500 --> 41:21.500]  TV and tell women how to run their lives and some women step in fetch it but so
[41:21.500 --> 41:25.340]  many women followed what the feminists said forever and were totally unhappy
[41:25.340 --> 41:30.460]  and unfulfilled and and now the big craze is women like to crawl around on
[41:30.460 --> 41:33.580]  their all fours of the chain around their neck being told what to do by men I
[41:33.580 --> 41:39.660]  think that's bad I don't like that but that's what you people create you get
[41:39.660 --> 41:43.660]  all these women begging to be dominated now all over the place begging to go
[41:43.660 --> 41:49.020]  join jihad and live in a live in a slave pit because they women would rather go
[41:49.020 --> 41:56.340]  live in a slave pit with dirty jihadis then sit there and have a you know what
[41:56.340 --> 42:01.500]  you call it Janet Reno lookalike tell her how to live her life sorry it's game
[42:01.500 --> 42:12.900]  over that anyways side issue I mean let's just get down to what this is
[42:12.900 --> 42:20.580]  really all about let's just get right down to it the big battle comes down to
[42:20.580 --> 42:25.580]  who loves the woman more truth is you don't love the women do you Janet Reno
[42:25.580 --> 42:29.700]  you just want to run their lives cuz you don't like real femininity you don't
[42:29.700 --> 42:33.300]  like how beautiful they are you don't want to be free you don't want to have
[42:33.300 --> 42:37.700]  guns and be free and strong you want to dominate them and control them and ruin
[42:37.700 --> 42:41.460]  them and make the state their dirty husband don't you well that's not gonna
[42:41.460 --> 42:45.860]  work scum because people want to be free and they want to be empowered and they
[42:45.860 --> 42:52.500]  want to be natural you have failed and they failed all over the place everybody
[42:52.500 --> 42:56.460]  I talked to I hear it on talk radio no one is buying that these ISIS hacks are
[42:56.460 --> 43:02.700]  real but they're still gonna try to ram through all this censorship here's the
[43:02.700 --> 43:06.780]  Financial Times of London article Russian and Turkish conspiracy theories
[43:06.780 --> 43:14.380]  swirl after Paris attacks and major leaders in Russia and Turkey are saying
[43:14.380 --> 43:19.020]  that it's not Muslim extremists that did the shootings but a French false flag
[43:19.020 --> 43:23.740]  the culprits are clear French citizens undertook this massacre and Muslims
[43:23.740 --> 43:30.740]  were blamed for it it goes on here's the problem false flags do happen and I'm
[43:30.740 --> 43:34.700]  the guy that popularized it let's just face it it's well known that I got people
[43:34.700 --> 43:39.260]  look into false flags inside jobs and all the different variants of that that
[43:39.260 --> 43:44.140]  said this worldwide jihad being funded by the West and Saudi Arabia is real
[43:44.140 --> 43:50.020]  these guys were set up and protected but nevertheless they were real terrorists
[43:50.020 --> 44:03.140]  from as best we can tell so there's that story I've got a bunch of economy news
[44:03.140 --> 44:09.780]  science news political news Rand Paul news we got Seahawks players shelling for
[44:09.780 --> 44:15.260]  Obamacare and new ads the NFL is just such a joke Lieberman turns outrage
[44:15.260 --> 44:20.180]  over Charlie Hebdo into World Wide War against Islam well yeah that's the plan
[44:20.180 --> 44:25.340]  but I would ask these real conspiracy theorists saying that these radical
[44:25.340 --> 44:29.620]  Muslims didn't kill 20 people did they kill the 300 plus thousand people in
[44:29.620 --> 44:33.900]  Syria who weren't radical Muslims or Christians yes they did did the Muslim
[44:33.900 --> 44:37.700]  Brotherhood crucified Christians and blow up hundreds of churches yes they did
[44:37.700 --> 44:41.740]  did they attack non radical Muslims and throw them off buildings on TV yes they
[44:41.740 --> 44:46.820]  did stop acting like you can dictate reality like Obama does saying you
[44:46.820 --> 44:50.100]  didn't build your business or two plus two equals five or raising the debt
[44:50.100 --> 44:52.780]  limit doesn't raise the debt limit or you can keep your doctor even though you
[44:52.780 --> 44:58.620]  can't and I never said that you don't control reality and let's just face it
[44:58.620 --> 45:08.300]  there is a major growing vein of Islam made up of ne'er-do-well thugs who want
[45:08.300 --> 45:12.260]  to run around murdering and killing and who are giving Western backing and are
[45:12.260 --> 45:15.780]  allowed to fly wherever they want and think they're all really sexy movie
[45:15.780 --> 45:21.380]  stars a bunch of crazy narcissist running around killing people everywhere
[45:21.380 --> 45:31.660]  and so just stop acting like it's not going on just stop it Brian AJ Michael
[45:31.660 --> 45:37.820]  Chris Shane we're gonna get to all of you briefly there's a great way to wake

[49:10.340 --> 49:14.140]  to not hold anything back and go forward let's go to your phone calls
[49:14.140 --> 49:19.340]  Brian Shane AJ Michael Chris and others Brian thanks for calling you're on the
[49:19.340 --> 49:25.500]  year. How you doing Alex? Good brother. I wanted to talk about you said yesterday
[49:25.500 --> 49:30.020]  that we had lost God in this country and that's why it's going down hell but I
[49:30.020 --> 49:34.300]  would say we've lost philosophy we've lost the ability to think and use logic.
[49:34.300 --> 49:39.940]  Yeah common sense. And to understand what you know Obama is doing you have to
[49:39.940 --> 49:44.620]  understand his philosophical background he was groomed and trained at Harvard
[49:44.620 --> 49:49.180]  under the teachings of William James and pragmatism and if you understand
[49:49.180 --> 49:53.500]  pragmatism it's an excuse for those empowered to do anything. And if you
[49:53.500 --> 49:57.300]  understand pragmatism you understand the ram corporation 50 years ago saying
[49:57.300 --> 50:02.940]  they would sell us on pragmatism and use financial incentives to enslave us. Yes
[50:02.940 --> 50:07.340]  it goes back to Plato to Kant and it's all a philosophical excuse to ignore
[50:07.340 --> 50:12.540]  law it's just pretty much anyone in power to do anything they want to so when
[50:12.540 --> 50:16.620]  you have a constitutional lawyer sitting there violating the law every day you
[50:16.620 --> 50:22.260]  know why because he's adhering to his pragmatism. But they're not pragmatic
[50:22.260 --> 50:26.780]  when they get their rights run over though. Of course not it's only who's
[50:26.780 --> 50:31.580]  in power it's who rules it's when you're in power you can control whoever.
[50:31.580 --> 50:37.260]  God forbid you become the low man on the totem pole. You want to add more are you
[50:37.260 --> 50:42.340]  done Brian? I'm good Alex thank you. Great caller. God I love that kind of info.
[50:42.340 --> 50:46.140]  Absolutely right. Well that's what we have no culture we have no common sense we
[50:46.140 --> 50:49.620]  were just rudderless on average and those of us that are concerned are called
[50:49.620 --> 50:53.140]  terrorists. Our country's turning into tyranny we're going into too much debt.
[50:53.140 --> 50:58.140]  That person's probably a terrorist the Southern Poverty Law Center says. We'll be right back stay with us.

[54:54.940 --> 55:02.900]  Megadeth.com to find their latest. Yeah, he got censored a lot in the tax whenever
[55:02.900 --> 55:07.900]  he dared to criticize Obama in his last album. Oh, but we support free speech
[55:07.900 --> 55:10.700]  to Americans, of course.
[55:13.700 --> 55:20.380]  The United States of America. I'm gonna stop. I want to go to Chris and Shane and
[55:20.380 --> 55:25.140]  AJ and Michael and Shirley and others. Ron Paul is coming up. Chris in Texas,
[55:25.140 --> 55:32.460]  you're on the air. Thank you for joining us. Hello? Yes, sir. Yeah, well I have a
[55:32.460 --> 55:42.300]  few points I'd like to make about the ISIS hat. Yeah, go ahead. The supposed ISIS hat.
[55:42.300 --> 55:56.020]  Well, I think it's pretty contrived. I mean, I think it's 75% that the NSA is
[55:56.020 --> 56:03.220]  behind it. I haven't even read the article, but I think these people forget that humans
[56:03.220 --> 56:13.420]  have senses and we can sense when things are, you know, off-putting. Well, sure. I
[56:13.420 --> 56:19.740]  mean, it just turned out that the whole North Korea hack thing was just a PR
[56:19.740 --> 56:23.660]  stunt, basically, an inside job. And then who really believes all these government
[56:23.660 --> 56:28.820]  systems got hacked and taken over by ISIS? I mean, give and then it's anonymous,
[56:28.820 --> 56:33.580]  though. So no one knows. It's just a perfect way to frame people. Look, the
[56:33.580 --> 56:37.260]  Internet is a tool to fight tyranny, but the tyrants designed it. They believe
[56:37.260 --> 56:42.740]  that they get the upper hand being able to spy on everybody. They now want to be
[56:42.740 --> 56:47.580]  able to legitimize the spying and legitimize the takeover and all the
[56:47.580 --> 56:50.380]  stuff they were hiding. And so you're going to see more of these cyber attacks
[56:50.380 --> 56:54.060]  and all these movies are coming out where nuclear reactors are getting blown up
[56:54.060 --> 56:58.060]  and stuff by hacks and one kind can destroy the world. So we need a big
[56:58.060 --> 57:01.820]  government program to stop it. I mean, this is, they're getting us ready for the
[57:01.820 --> 57:06.100]  new electronic Pearl Harbor. Appreciate the call. AJ in Ohio, you're on the air.
[57:06.100 --> 57:12.140]  Go ahead. Hey Alex, I just want to make two quick comments about two subjects. The
[57:12.140 --> 57:16.860]  first one was what you talked about culture. I'm here in Ohio and as you
[57:16.860 --> 57:21.260]  know, I was state one national championship last night down in Columbus.
[57:21.260 --> 57:26.180]  The Columbus police dealt with rioting and 90 different fires last night. Okay.
[57:26.180 --> 57:31.420]  Why can't we get together and, you know, riot or not riot, but, you know,
[57:31.420 --> 57:35.700]  protest and get together and, and, you know, fight back against tyranny? We have
[57:35.700 --> 57:39.380]  to worry about a stupid football game. Well, and I mean, notice that nobody's
[57:39.380 --> 57:42.540]  criticizing the police for trying to stop people that burned down a bunch of
[57:42.540 --> 57:46.700]  buildings. Well, it's the same thing when people use a cop that shoots somebody
[57:46.700 --> 57:51.460]  questionably to burn stuff down. That's just criminals using that as cover to go
[57:51.460 --> 57:55.460]  out and loot that then discredits legitimate demonstration. But yeah, why
[57:55.460 --> 57:58.940]  don't people go out and demonstrate about the bill of rights or the border
[57:58.940 --> 58:03.020]  being wide open or Obama becoming a dictator or our government arming
[58:03.020 --> 58:08.020]  Al Qaeda, only our military protested. Why do people go out and riot when their
[58:08.020 --> 58:14.940]  team wins or loses? It shows screwed up priorities, doesn't it? Yes, it does. And
[58:14.940 --> 58:19.780]  the second thing I wanted to talk about was the ISIS hacks. One of my best
[58:19.780 --> 58:27.460]  friends was in Iraq. He did three tours in Iraq and he said that that whole
[58:27.460 --> 58:31.140]  Middle Eastern area, not only is it incredibly hard to get any kind of
[58:31.140 --> 58:35.300]  internet access, they had to use satellites and things like that. Oh yeah, it's
[58:35.300 --> 58:38.820]  cavemanville. Stay there. I want to come back and talk to you next hour coming up.
[58:38.820 --> 58:43.540]  Ron Paul, but yeah, I mean, North Korea can't tie their shoelaces and they ran
[58:43.540 --> 58:51.580]  the hacks. It's all BS. From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere
[58:51.580 --> 58:56.140]  itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day. But it's
[58:56.140 --> 59:00.100]  not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to
[59:00.100 --> 59:03.460]  five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air. And
[59:03.460 --> 59:08.100]  most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within
[59:08.100 --> 59:11.700]  their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[59:11.700 --> 59:15.820]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[59:15.820 --> 59:19.260]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets. They're
[59:19.260 --> 59:22.780]  allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics, it was clear
[59:22.780 --> 59:27.460]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic
[59:27.460 --> 59:31.020]  environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against. Made with
[59:31.020 --> 59:35.620]  organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA. The new Info
[59:35.620 --> 59:39.220]  Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be
[59:39.220 --> 59:42.820]  brought with you throughout any toxic environment. Now available exclusively
[59:42.820 --> 59:49.740]  at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3888-253-3139.
[59:50.620 --> 59:55.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:55.980 --> 01:00:11.660]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:18.980]  does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin,
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:26.460]  Texas. Alex Jones. Farmer Congressman and the leader of the Libertarian
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.900]  Worldwide Movement, Ron Paul, is going to be joining us Dr. Paul. A.J. in Ohio was
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:37.380]  talking about this hack, ISIS hack of Pentagon Twitter accounts traced back to
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:43.820]  Maryland. NSA implicated in latest cybersecurity scare. They've got the
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:49.100]  motive. They've got the know-how. There was all of it hoax that North Korea hacked.
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.220]  Sony and you were saying you were talking to one of your friends that's
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.540]  spent three tours over in the Middle East and he was saying that basically
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:02.340]  it's dirt floor stone age. No internet, correct? Yeah, I mean basically you have
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:06.300]  to have you know advanced satellite equipment to you know even be able to
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:11.540]  get internet access out there for one. And for two, I mean just the education
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.940]  that it takes to be able to learn how to hack and things like that. Yes, there's
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.780]  been incidences where there's 17 year old kids, but these are kids that are
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:23.140]  prodigies. You have the average, you know, caveman, you know, thug mentality that goes
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:26.980]  and joins ISIS. You can't just go down to your local bookstore and buy hacking
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.220]  for dummies and hack, you know, an intricate system like Facebook or
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:36.260]  Twitter. Sure, I mean you've got people out there. Some of the hackers are just
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:40.180]  really smart and able to guess passwords. But when it comes to the code hacking,
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:45.660]  this is idiot savant type stuff and it's not coming out of North Korea. It's not
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:50.940]  coming out of the, you know, the deserts of Iraq or Syria or the mountains of
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:58.020]  Syria. We now know it's come out in the news that it bounces back to Maryland.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:04.220]  I mean they don't even try to hide where this is coming from. I mean these people
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:08.700]  are smoking their own dope. They have to be to think that we would actually
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:13.780]  believe this. All it is is a push for cybersecurity. Of course it is. You see you're
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:20.060]  informed though. Remember the average person out there is really scared that
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.900]  Al-Qaeda's hiding under the bed at night and gonna, I mean it's like a child
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:27.780]  believing that there's monsters in the closet. Exactly and you know that's the
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.460]  kind of the sad part because it really doesn't take much brain power to think
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.980]  outside of the box and go wait a minute. There's something wrong with this
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:37.620]  picture but the average American just doesn't see it and I don't understand.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.940]  Or they go to the extreme and say it's all fake. There was no shooters in
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.940]  France. Just default and believe nothing that's being said. When all the evidence
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:50.980]  shows these are terrorists protected, funded and aided by the West who are
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:57.180]  useful idiots. We have that proven false flag by proxy. In fact that's the term I'm
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.580]  pointing. False flag by proxy is what this is. It's a variant of false flag.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:05.700]  It's a let it happen, open the door, finance it scenario. We have them. They
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.740]  did this. They're going to let a bunch of these people attack us and folks it's
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:13.620]  going to be real when they shoot down jet airliners and stuff and I am here
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:18.740]  saying do not take our freedoms. You let this happen to do this. I've got a bunch
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:22.660]  of top economists and others have come out and they're all saying the same
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:28.740]  thing that this is going to be exploited to take freedoms. Economists, world
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:32.420]  leaders will exploit Charlie Hebdo to eliminate encryption. They will use this
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:36.940]  to strip us of all rights. Close quote. We got to get William Benning back on to
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.660]  pop it about this as well. Former head of the NSA. I mean look at this. It just
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:47.220]  goes on and on. Anything else caller? Yeah actually the funny thing is is you
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.460]  keep hearing you know it's plastered all over the news about these 12 people that
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.340]  died in this Charlie Hebdo attack but then you have Boko Haram going into
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:57.580]  Africa and killing 2,000 people and you don't even see anything about that on
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.620]  the nightly news. So there's a there's a narrative control here. There you the
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.500]  West is funding out of Libya. They turned Libya four years ago over to Al Qaeda.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.940]  They're using that now as a pipeline because Libya had built roads and
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:16.020]  infrastructure into sub-Saharan Africa to fund Boko Haram and others to run
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.940]  around killing tens of thousands and putting women into slavery and you're
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.540]  not going to hear Jack squat out of feminists. That feminists want your five
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:28.580]  year old boy to be taught how to dress like a girl and teach you that you're
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.060]  not their parents and enslave you and dominate you and break your will. They
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.460]  can care less if thousands of women are being gang raped and murdered right now
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:39.900]  by groups funded by Western intelligence. They just want to dominate you
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.860]  because you're a high earner and make you learn to step and fetch it when they
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.100]  snap their fingers out of fake guilt. We'll be right back with former
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:51.700]  Congressman Ron Paul. They'll be with us just for 20 minutes then I'll go to
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:05:00.460]  Shane and others that are holding stay with us. Every year we make resolutions
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:03.980]  to lose weight and get in shape and the truth is it's hard even with diet and
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:08.860]  exercise because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:12.460]  more than ever before. Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry I
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.740]  found that super high-quality nutraceuticals in addition to my
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:20.140]  diet and exercise were the answers synergistically worked. I can see the
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.860]  drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost my increased
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.860]  stamina and more of a twinkle in my eye. That's why we are now so excited to

[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:51.140]  he is I think almost more effective now than when he was in Congress from 1996
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:56.020]  until just a year or so ago his son is one of the major front runners for
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:01.340]  president we're gonna talk about that and more joining us is former
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:05.740]  congressman and the leader of the libertarian Liberty Movement worldwide
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:12.380]  Dr. Ron Paul and drudgereport.com picked it up we picked it up they got a lot
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:18.940]  of attention Ron Paul's predictions really for 2015 and beyond what he sees
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:22.980]  coming in the new year now he wrote that a few weeks ago now we're into the new
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:29.340]  year now a lot of economists are saying they believe that the real economic
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:35.100]  implosion is getting closer so he's going to spend 20 minutes with us
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:41.500]  giving us his breakdown of what he sees coming and and remember he said many
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:46.660]  times if we put out the ideas of liberty as the solution to the crisis we
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:51.100]  could use the crisis at the end of this cycle to try to promote freedom and
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:54.980]  fix things the socialists and the insiders are gonna try to use it to
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.740]  bring in more tyranny so we're reaching that critical point Dr. Paul thank you
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:03.860]  so much for joining us thank you Alex good to be with you again you've got
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:09.620]  the floor tell us what's what you see coming well you know is even though I
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:13.260]  wrote something I think it was about 18 pages long but it was longer when I was
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:16.340]  doing it I was thinking about my special orders that I used to do on the
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:20.420]  house floor when you could get a special hour so it goes over you know the
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:23.980]  analysis of what's going on and why we have trouble and what I think we should
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:28.740]  do but actually the motivation for me to start to write it was just to write
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:32.660]  something much shorter and talk about the crisis in the inner city you know
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.820]  the militarization of our police the abuse of our civil liberties at the same
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.740]  time the demands of the inner cities because I sympathize with those who are
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:45.620]  on the receiving end of the militarization of the police at the same
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:52.540]  time you know those individuals in the inner city are you know they have been
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:57.580]  they have been used to have an entitlement mentality and it just serves
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:02.180]  their interest to be being more and more and then we end up in conflict well
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:07.380]  each side has different demands I think each side are wrong to a degree but I
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:11.740]  certainly think that the big issue of the inner cities and I mentioned in my
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:17.420]  paper that this has been going on for a long time I I think it was even in the
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:21.660]  60s the riots we had in the 60s had a lot to do with the inner cities and the
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:26.860]  poverty in the inner cities everybody agrees there's poverty there but some
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.500]  people think well we need more government transfer programs which I don't
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:34.220]  agree with but we need to understand first that we protect civil liberties
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:39.860]  for everybody equally at the same time we have to understand poverty then you
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.220]  have to get into economic policy you have to get into the Federal Reserve the
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.260]  destruction of the currency the destruction of the middle class and
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:52.500]  why the welfare state ends up getting the very wealthy people in charge of the
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:57.020]  distribution of wealth so I've always maintained that welfare isn't the
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:01.980]  principle is so bad but it's it's accepted by the far left and the people
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.940]  who want something for free but they don't get anything because the people
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.860]  who are really in charge the bankers in the military industrial complex they
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:13.820]  get in charge and they use that principle to their benefits and I think
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:18.300]  that's the mess that we're in in today because the the cities are getting poor
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:24.300]  the middle class is being eliminated and there's these constant demands and I
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.820]  think it's because we've lost our way in the understanding about personal
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:31.380]  liberties all about and property rights and sound money and all the things I've
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:37.580]  talked about for so long so I saw the big debate between the militarization of
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:41.060]  the police and the people who are unreceiving in and the poverty in the
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:45.820]  inner city as a consequence of a lot of ignorance is as far as what is good
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.220]  economic policy and what true liberty is all about I mean true liberty doesn't
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:53.740]  mean that you get what you want and you demand that and that you're entitled to
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:57.580]  it that has nothing to do with liberty that's a that represents a violation of
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:03.140]  liberty so that is the general theme of what I was writing about but even though
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:07.500]  most of it was warning people and telling people what a mess I think we're
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:12.700]  in I really conclude with a bit of optimism as I always do that you know
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:17.860]  the Internet is providing us a vehicle for getting our message out and I think
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:22.460]  that the message is alive and well I think the young people are listening I
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:27.180]  think what you do on on radio and all your efforts I think is is very
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:32.700]  beneficial and a lot of people realize the mess we're in that the economy is
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.500]  in shambles and the foreign policy is ridiculous so they're looking for answers
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:42.020]  and I believe that the freedom movement provides those answers well and and
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:46.300]  certainly we've predicted what's coming you've written books on the subjects we
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.940]  know how this works we're not rocket scientists this has happened hundreds and
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:54.020]  hundreds of times in history or even more hundreds of times in different
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:58.260]  countries just the last few hundred years going back to your essay that's at
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:05.020]  ronpaulinstitute.org we posted it at infowars.com as well inner city
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:09.620]  turmoil and other crises my predictions for 2015 I want to get into some of
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:13.580]  those other crises but you know I've always been a you know nonpartisan
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:17.500]  constitutionalist but I have supported libertarians who run as Republicans or
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:22.380]  Democrats and have supported you and your son and and others against
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:27.620]  statist but the Democrats I think really have sunk to a new low with their
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:32.580]  open fanning of racial division of anti-police garbage that isn't meant to
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:38.820]  reform police but meant to create a Balkanization and really to democratic
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:44.100]  connected groups out singing deck the halls with dead cops we have these
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:49.900]  videos really vicious provocations that if libertarians did anything like this
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:54.020]  we'd be arrested and I know you're familiar with this what do you think the
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:59.540]  attempt is there we know unemployment's doubled for blacks under Obama we know
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:03.980]  collectivism has hurt them more than anybody is this a desperate attempt to
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:09.140]  just distract and make it racial or or scapegoat the police because I'm a
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:13.500]  critic of the police state as are you but not of just scapegoating the
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:20.300]  individual police no this is the far left likes this evil and they like you
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.060]  know the discord because then they figure that they can promote their
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:26.220]  programs just like I said you know the inner cities have messed so they're
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:30.980]  arguing that the 16 trillion dollars we've spent the past 50 years on on the
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:36.300]  trying to get rid of poverty you know starting with lbj and they figure 32
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:41.220]  trillion dollars with would do the job but no I think they're a provocateur's
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:47.420]  and I think they're small but they do get the crowds riled up and they sort of
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:52.180]  you know I think the Al Sharpton's of the world are I think what one the one
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:56.180]  suggestion I had made is that you know there's going to be a math there is a
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:00.060]  math people ought to understand the Second Amendment and they ought to make
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:05.100]  sure that they you know pay attention to the false promises of the Al Sharpton's
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:10.180]  of the world and that is why you know the people if you and I talk about this
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:14.260]  you know we can get on the receiving end oh you know flaming blacks and all that
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:19.900]  kind of stuff but what they ought to do is look to two black leaders that we
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:24.460]  have in economic policy and they understand this and they understand
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:29.260]  racism because because they have put up with it in their own life and that's
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:34.420]  Walter Williams and Tom so I think these guys are are just great they're free
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.500]  market people they believe in liberty and they understand why there's poverty in
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.260]  the inner city and I think they're they're fantastic so if your listeners
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:47.620]  have not read Walter Williams and Tom so they I'm sure they have because of I
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:52.540]  know your audience but there's some I think it's really worthwhile looking at
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:58.940]  what they say rather than than believing that I al Sharpton talks for people you
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:04.300]  know and they hate aggravate things and and of course that generally what
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.700]  happens you know they go in there and and just stir up more trouble sure let's
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:11.780]  elaborate briefly on that and get into some of some of the other warnings and
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:16.180]  crises you see getting worse in the new year and then we'll talk about the
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:19.300]  economy with you and then the election coming up and more again former
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:24.940]  congressman Ron Paul of Ron Paul Institute.org is our guest amazing
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:30.460]  analysis amazing essays and articles there every day videos every day at
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:35.860]  Ron Paul channel.com specifically you were alluding to the Second Amendment as
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:41.140]  a good thing to maintain order if society breaks down
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:45.860]  undoubtedly I think the Democrats would like to start a limited civil war in
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:49.420]  this country. Can you elaborate on your statement about the Second Amendment's
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:54.020]  role in any type of societal breakdown? You know I was thinking about in the
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:18:01.220]  midst of the problem up in Ferguson what would I do if I lived there and I had a
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:07.060]  store I mean it just makes no sense for the people who feel like they've been
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:11.180]  mistreated and they want to strike out against white people in the
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:15.100]  establishment they go and destroy buildings that are owned by black people
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.180]  their neighbors the people who make a living there they'll go and bust up
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:23.180]  their windows so it made no sense but it seems like there wasn't this
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.900]  understanding that they have a right and they should be defending their
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:31.700]  property so you know if if you really had an understanding of the Second
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:35.860]  Amendment whether you're in Ferguson or wherever if people started breaking in
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:39.660]  and you see people jumping in and out of the broken windows and hauling off their
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:44.260]  loot it seems to me like maybe some of that could have been averted by just
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.780]  somebody having a right to defend themselves and that means the use of
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:54.740]  the Second Amendment but evidently that was not done I guess people maybe the
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:19:01.100]  rules are too strict in places like this and in the city so I think they would be
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:04.740]  less confident if they knew that they were likely to be shot at if they
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.100]  broke into something you try to burn down my house or business you're gonna
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.980]  get shot and that's not because I'm looking for trouble that's the normal
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.980]  behavior and in areas where people act like that you don't have looting in
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:18.420]  robbing like this because folks would end up pushing daisies and not be on the
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:22.620]  green side Ron Paul moving quick in these six seven minutes we've got left
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:27.100]  with you here today I want to get into more of your predictions but shifting
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:34.100]  gears back to Obama himself even Turley the liberal professor of law says
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:38.380]  Obama has done about triple the constitutional violations of Bush that
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:42.540]  you and I and others were big critics of as well the Republican leadership is
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:46.540]  standing down when Obama wants to open the border shut down more power plants
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:51.780]  put our military under NATO control I mean for all intents and purposes is
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:56.300]  Obama not setting the precedent for an imperial presidency and what should be
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:00.340]  done about it well he's continuing it but that's been going on for so long I
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:06.020]  mean we could go back and study Woodrow Wilson he was no saint you know and
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:11.620]  even though some of that stuff with our government's backed off after Wilson was
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:19.140]  out of office and after he died but the the process has continued you know what
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:22.980]  we haven't really had a constitutional president in a long long time so
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:26.860]  whether it was Bush or and Obama's just building on this executive order has
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:30.180]  been around for a long time we've been going to war with executive orders and
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:35.540]  without declarations we have a monetary system that can bail out anybody
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.180]  everybody not only in the United States and our corporations but worldwide
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:43.780]  trillions and trillions of dollars and that's not done with approval I think
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:48.060]  the Congress is totally derelict in their responsibility because they allow
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:53.780]  it to happen and policies come and the Fed does what they please there's no
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:59.820]  limits on who what which friends they can bail out so it is a process and yes
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:04.660]  he's an imperial president but he's just falling in the footsteps of others
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:10.140]  and he had you know especially been bad on the curtailment of freedom of speech
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:15.460]  you talk about all this talk about what was going on in France I wish they would
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:20.660]  deal with you know what is going on in this country because Obama's been known
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:25.460]  to put people in prison if they if they don't reveal their sources and and so
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:29.380]  it's freedom of freedom of speech is being attacked here as well well that's
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:34.060]  right on the heels of this so-called ISIS hack that's now been traced back to
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:40.060]  Maryland and US sources just like the North Korea hack was fake now Obama AFP
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:44.140]  reports has renewed push for cybersecurity and restricting internet
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:50.260]  freedom Ron Paul do you buy into ISIS being able to hack US military sites and
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.700]  take them over or do you think this might be a false flag well I'm always
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:57.820]  skeptical what was it that they were blaming the North Koreans on long I
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:07.100]  said they can't even turn on their lights you know they don't have any lights there is a dark country and they were accusing them of this expertise and it's
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:12.820]  something you know on the internet and I was very doubtful so yes you know whether
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:20.060]  it's a deliberately planned false flag or whether it is accidental or a blowback
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:24.740]  or an unintended consequence it's always used to expand the state and then when
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:28.980]  there is a problem there's an assassination or bombing and we have a
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:33.700]  government investigation it's have an investigation well the investigation
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:39.460]  isn't to seek out truth and most of time we never get to truth but we do get the
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:43.700]  defense of the government you know when when this torture issue came up and they
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:47.580]  had this you know right now they're not releasing the report you know in the
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:53.580]  Congress and they and they should but they talked about all the torturers and
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:57.620]  they're finding out that people were breaking the law right and left but
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:02.860]  none of them get punished none of them go to go to prison nobody got penalized
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:09.260]  for messing up on the information that was available before 9-11 but for the
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:13.380]  torturers the only person that went to prison is the CIA agent that came clean
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:17.380]  and warned us and told us the truth about it so we put him in prison that's
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:22.460]  what is what is disgusting and that is what people have to know and and we're
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:28.100]  making progress here I think it's like 80% of the people are very untrusting
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.100]  toward the government you think oh well that's terrible you don't want people
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:35.420]  untrusting yep but if the government is not taking care of us and protecting our
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:39.780]  liberties if the people are waking up and all of a sudden saying hey you know we
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:43.700]  we can't really rely on the government to tell us the truth that means they
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:48.300]  have to seek the truth someplace else and hopefully we all can provide that
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:52.740]  for them oh absolutely and the few minutes we've got left some of the other
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:57.180]  predictions that are in your essay that's up at Ron Paul Institute.org and
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:03.060]  infowars.com other predictions or crises you see in 2015 and then briefly I
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:07.100]  want to talk about I mean I believe Rand Paul is the best person for president
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:10.140]  it's obvious he's gonna run you know the news just said a few weeks ago you know
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.820]  he of course he's gonna run you've said it six eight months ago I mean sure I
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:19.660]  mean Rand Paul's getting ready Ted Cruz I mean you see Jeb Bush absolutely
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:23.460]  terrible might as well just have Hillary you've got Hillary but is this a
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:27.780]  dynasty where we're gonna have King George the Ninth or King, King Clinton
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:31.340]  the 12th I mean we're not North Korea or England there's got to in fact let's
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:38.340]  cover that first election coming up 2016 it's pretty much already starting where
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.940]  do you I mean obviously you support your son but he is the best candidate there
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:49.020]  I like Ted Cruz as well and then it just gets worse from there. No no obviously
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:54.860]  Rand is doing quite well and they have to sort of you know they were giving him
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.780]  some attention and it wasn't all bad it was it was decent and a lot of people
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:05.380]  know him now and they like what he's been saying but but all of a sudden what
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:10.960]  has happened the last couple weeks first it was they don't they didn't want you
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.220]  know Rand and others to get much attention so they had to divert the
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:19.620]  attention and they say oh Bush is going to run. Jeb Bush is a great candidate
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:24.260]  Bush Bush Bush he's you know getting ready and he's gonna have the money and
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:28.980]  he's our guy but then you know there's dissension among the ranks and
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:35.300]  evidently Romney wasn't as wasn't too pleased to just step back so he's you
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:40.420]  know maybe I'm going to run so the media plays this up now the only two
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:47.140]  candidates that seem to exist will be Bush and Romney so that's their way
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:51.820]  of exclusion it's sometimes even when they say well there's now you know 10
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:57.260]  people 15 people going to run they'll include Rand but it's not where it was
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:02.540]  by all the polling you know a month ago these guys didn't even show up but but
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:07.540]  all of which means that he's on the receiving end that I guess I could say
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:15.660]  I had received as well they know how to handle it in the public if they think
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:19.820]  you're doing too well they don't want you to succeed. Well that's why I thought
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:24.820]  it was smart that Rand started basically doing presidential type election
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.820]  things first so that he would get the attention up front and is still a
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:33.020]  frontrunner in most polls that's why they're scared and are trying to only
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:38.260]  put Jeb Bush and Romney out there and make that fight all about it we don't
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:42.620]  need Mitt Romney after two runs we don't need Jeb Bush my goodness we don't
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:48.020]  need Chris Christie these guys are just Democrats or Beltway Republican Rhinos
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:54.660]  we need Rand Paul and he is just the best candidate across the board I mean
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:58.300]  can you what do you say to the libertarian and constitutionalist troops
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.980]  out there what can they do to really make sure that Rand stays at the top
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:07.860]  of the ticket. Well I'm not too keen on giving people precise advice a lot of
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:13.780]  people have asked me and I would sort of try to dismiss it a bit and say well do
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:17.980]  whatever you want you know if you want to be involved and get involved if you
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:23.700]  like a candidate support him you know campaign and I thought that was what was
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:28.100]  so neat about our campaign you know is that a lot of people did spontaneously
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:33.740]  do a lot of things that organize and raise money so I think that people need
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:38.980]  to do something to be helpful and sometimes it's running for office and
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:42.560]  and you know at the same time you're running for office that you can speak
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.620]  out about all the issues and all the other candidates so it's it's something
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:52.460]  that the individuals has to decide even if an individual is much more into
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:58.500]  education and teaching people how wide that they should understand the issues
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:03.260]  that were that were pushing you know on the sound money and civil liberties that
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.980]  to me is very important you have to change people absolutely that would help
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:10.180]  a person like Rand as well. Ron you've got to go you're already over I want to
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:13.700]  get any other just quick predictions but please say to Rand it's just my
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:19.100]  layman advice do what Ted Cruz is doing attacking Jeb Bush and attacking
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:25.260]  Romney as squishy middle because that's what we need to keep him at the top from
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:31.260]  my view he needs to come out in a classy way obviously and point out how bad
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:36.300]  Jeb Bush is point out how bad Chris Christie is point out how bad you know
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:40.580]  Romney is compared or they are gonna really try to push him to the back
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.460]  anything else you think is important for 2015 to warn people about?
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:50.420]  No other than the fact that I think our economic crisis is going to continue it's going to get worse during this year it's not going to get
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:55.420]  better the government is going to try to play it up that things are getting better
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:59.620]  I think our foreign policy is going to continue I think it's very very dangerous
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:05.780]  and this country has to face up the fact that it's bankrupt if it doesn't
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:10.020]  things are gonna get much worse before it gets better. Ronpaulinstitute.org
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:14.700]  thank you so much Godspeed. All right there he goes ladies and gentlemen
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:21.060]  Ronpaul joining us for the last 25 minutes or so exclusive intense in-depth
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:27.260]  real-question interview. Ronpaul is the best I trust him I've known him for
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:36.740]  I can't believe it's 18 19 years 19 years and he's the guy for president Ted Cruz
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:40.460]  to make a great VP but I'm telling you Ted Cruz is getting more aggressive
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:45.140]  that's why in polls he's now number one in real polls Ted Cruz is now taking a
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:49.740]  lead because he's being aggressive it's what people want. We're on the march the
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:56.740]  Empire. They want to see Painter attack. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:03.860]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:07.420]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:11.420]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:15.660]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:19.500]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.660]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:27.440]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:30.820]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:34.500]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:38.900]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:42.740]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:44.300]  well Obama now wants to take over the internet after Al Qaeda attacked the
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:49.700]  Pentagon websites and Twitter and Facebook oh excuse me Isis the new name I
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:57.100]  forgot her IS or is solar whatever they've confused the public with well
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:02.900]  now Obama has renewed push for cybersecurity law and the more NSA the
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:09.060]  more spying the more trillions we spend the bigger bases Al Qaeda gets and our
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:13.100]  government funds them boy that makes sense it actually does president Barack
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:17.340]  Obama made a renewed push today for cyber security legislation asking the
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:21.420]  new Congress to revive an initiative stalled over the past few years the
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:25.060]  new proposal would allow increased sharing information on cyber threats from
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:29.100]  the private sector with protection from liability that means spying illegally
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:33.380]  the measure also would criminalize the sale of stolen financial data and that's
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:36.780]  already illegal folks it's called wire fraud and would require companies to
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:41.300]  notify consumers about data breaches Obama speaking at the White House
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:45.140]  meeting congressional leaders and recent events have highlighted the need for
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:49.260]  tougher legislation quote with the sony attack that took place which is now
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:54.100]  admitted to be an inside job I'm quoting Obama this is insane with the
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:57.780]  sony attack that took place with the Twitter account that was hacked by
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:02.700]  Islamist jihadist sympathizers yesterday it just goes to show how much work we
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:09.180]  need to do both public and private sector to strengthen our cyber security so
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:14.340]  there you go that's what's going on ladies and gentlemen and it's just so
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:19.100]  predictable that right as all this legislation is being reintroduced all
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:27.740]  hell breaks loose I want to go to Shane and I want to go to Shirley and Terry and

[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:48.300]  they were trained with the underwear bomber I mean that this is just insane
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:52.300]  is that he was run by a globalist handler so we're gonna be talking about
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:56.300]  that getting into the economy and a lot more but you heard Ron Paul earlier

[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:22.900]  thanks for holding you're on the air there yeah I definitely mainly called
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:27.300]  about the the Paris incident but I'll kick it off with a couple of comments
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:30.900]  looking forward to hearing Kurt Haskell I think you mentioned about him
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:35.020]  calling from Detroit I believe he's an expat now and he's actually relocated
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:40.180]  to Central America somewhere I hadn't paid attention to that but I saw him on
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:43.380]  video Skype earlier when they were testing I'll ask him that when he comes
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:47.300]  on yeah and he's got a he's doing a little bit of radio now actually so I
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:50.780]  think that's pretty cool he sees you know this this whole thing that's happened
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:54.500]  to him made him pretty active yeah he looked like he lost some weight when I
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:58.700]  saw him on Skype before Ron Paul came on and they just corrected me he is now
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:04.540]  in Costa Rica most of the time so he is boy voyage the United States yeah
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:09.460]  climbing climbing tropical fruit trees will help you peel off a few pounds as
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:14.020]  far as Rand Paul which isn't the main reason I called I don't know I'm still
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:18.100]  on the fence if I'm even going to vote this time around because Rand Paul that
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:22.940]  I feel like it's becoming more of a what I call tealtown these days it just he
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:28.940]  just seems to not really reflect his father whatsoever I mean well he has
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.700]  made some more hawkish statements and separated himself a bit from his dad in
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:37.660]  a purely political attempt to win the presidency but I know he's a libertarian
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:43.060]  pro-gun pro sovereignty and a trillion times better than Hillary Clinton so
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:46.780]  that's where I stand on that but yeah he's made some disturbing comments so is
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:53.420]  Nigel Farage the leader of UKIP and that's being done purely to play politics
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:43:00.020]  I think it's a mistake but he's doing it it's better than Joppa Bush but as far
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:04.300]  as the Paris thing I had a couple quick little comments and one was that the
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:08.740]  video footage that appeared to be you know kind of fake or whatever with the
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:13.460]  cop being missed by the gun supposedly that was taken with the cell phone
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:19.540]  camera and I think that's kind of odd because if I was witnessing something
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:23.420]  like that I don't think grabbing my phone to shoot video would be my first
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:28.340]  priority I think it would probably be maybe making a call to you know get some
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:32.740]  backup because clearly in the cops in the area are all being shot so I thought
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:36.380]  that that was a little sketchy but what I was what I was curious about is this
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:41.620]  may or may not be the case with this Paris thing but you know how after
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:45.220]  Sandy Hook it's like every other person seems to think everything's a total
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:49.540]  hoax and I know that's not what you think but what I'm curious about is do
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:53.180]  you think that there's a new level of sophistication with a lot of these
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:44:00.300]  false flags where they plant a couple of pieces of you know flimsy evidence that
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:05.140]  get everybody talking and steer them in the wrong direction so like to make it
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:10.020]  to me yeah when you're trying to I mean decipher cloak and dagger dirty tricks
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:14.260]  it's pretty hard to do it's just that when you then you learn that they were
[01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:18.460]  funded by Western funding the then you learn that it was the same Amarillo
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:22.100]  Locky connection underwear bomber then those are big red flags that they were
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:27.500]  patchy provocateurs the classic MO has been followed and then yeah it kind of
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:32.100]  becomes a red herring you know to say the whole thing was staged because they
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:36.660]  have staged events before but then you learn the school had been closed and
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:40.140]  reopened and you got video of the kids going in circles in and out of the
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:44.140]  building and they don't call the rescue choppers for two hours and then they
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:48.020]  tear the building down and seal it and they they get caught using blue screens
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:53.660]  and a email by Bloomberg comes out in the lawsuit where he's telling his
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:59.340]  people get ready in the next 24 hours to capitalize on a shooting yeah so Sandy
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:06.540]  Hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors in my view manufactured I
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:10.620]  couldn't believe it at first I knew they had actors there clearly but I thought
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:15.340]  they killed some real kids and it just shows how bold they are that they
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:22.380]  clearly used actors I mean they even ended up using photos of kids killed in
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:29.620]  mass shootings here in a fake mass shooting in Turkey so yeah or Pakistan
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:32.720]  the sky is now the limit I appreciate your call
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:39.540]  Shirley in Louisiana you're on the air welcome yeah how many times does the
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:46.820]  person have to lie to you before you quit believing anything they say if if they
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:50.980]  lie to me saying food tastes good and it doesn't then I trust them still or
[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:55.980]  if they if they fudge on something you know because they don't want to get in
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:46:00.580]  trouble then I might let it pass once or twice but if they lie on substantive
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:07.060]  business deals or are deceptive about products or as government lie to me two
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:10.900]  or three times then I certify them as liars and don't believe anything they
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:14.340]  ever say and will not associate with them the problem is with corrupt
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:18.660]  corporations and governments we can't get them out of our lives and they're
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:22.420]  there in our lives at the barrel of a gun
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:27.980]  you're a better person than I am all you have to do is lie to me once and case
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:32.580]  closed I won't believe anything you say even if you were staying on 20 story
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:37.380]  stack of Bibles no I hear you but I mean I I mean I consider one big lie on
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:44.380]  something substantive to be a deal breaker with me in relationships or
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:52.820]  anything else but if somebody you know lies to you about something to save
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:58.580]  face that that isn't premeditated I mean let's be honest I mean I think
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:02.700]  everybody their wife has asked them does this look good and you and you've
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:05.700]  learned a woman doesn't really want to know if it looks good they want to hear
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:10.340]  you tell them it looks good so you just tell them it looks good and maybe that
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:16.500]  goes for men as well because you know people say really give me criticism and
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:20.220]  you give them criticism and they don't like it so I don't consider white lies
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:28.740]  the same as big lies but but yes I get what you're saying I mean and then we
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:33.140]  expect the country to do better I mean the people just keep falling for it
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:41.180]  falling for it I don't see any help for us at all well Gallup showed 84% of
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:45.020]  Americans think the government's the number one threat and think that it's
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:49.220]  run by criminals two weeks ago Congress has a 7 to 8 percent approval rating
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:52.820]  depending on which poll you look at whether it's Gallup or Mason Dixon or
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:58.580]  Zogby or others or CNN time polls it's about 7-8 percent summer as high as 9
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:03.580]  percent ooh you know 9% like the government so I wouldn't say the public
[01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:10.580]  keeps buying it we've gotten to the point where we just accept being lied to I
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:20.500]  think the word is broken they have a movie out you know unbroken well we are
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:24.940]  broken and see I'm not broken you're not broken you're calling into a show
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:29.500]  you're upset you want folks to do something I get it but we can go from
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.140]  being broken to unbroken in a matter of minutes and that's what homeland
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:38.020]  securities really for is that if we try to impeach the president or the states
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:43.220]  move to block all this tyranny and there's a gun confiscation order criminal
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:46.860]  elements of the federal government will detonate bombs blaming on the liberty
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:51.020]  movement to gain the moral high ground to start a civil war we have to
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:55.980]  pre-neutralize that or have our assets in place everywhere to videotape it when
[01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:59.500]  it happens to prove its false flag quickly that's why they'll put an
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:03.340]  internet kill switch in place which they have to shut down opposition to
[01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:07.580]  expose their game plan when they go for it all and there's a good chance they'll
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:11.540]  nuke a city or something and claim us army troops that were patriots did it
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:15.860]  and claim that I'm involved and I mean I've already been blamed with the Boston
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:20.820]  bombing and other crazy stuff on MSNBC so I fully expect if there's a
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:26.300]  mushroom cloud they'll blame talk radio in general I'll be named and then they'll
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:31.380]  say something like you know he was pulled over and pulled a gun on an officer
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:37.860]  and was taken out or Alex Jones had a stroke today Ron Paul had a heart attack
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:42.060]  today I mean when they move folks they're gonna kill a bunch of people in
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:45.140]  Congress they know we're patriots they're gonna try to wipe out opposition
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:50.300]  but the minute I see that stuff starting I go into a whole different posture so
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:55.380]  it's it's not like I'm a sitting duck or anything so we know the enemy plan and
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:50:00.020]  that's a big deal that gives us a major leg up thank you Shirley we're gonna go
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:04.220]  to break and come back and go to Joseph and then go to Terry Michael Blake and

[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:12.340]  one of the radio producers out there CJ one of the producers of the Elkshown
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:18.580]  show was asking the question why does Centcom even have a Twitter account well
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:24.060]  they've got to communicate and release statements to the media and you could say
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:26.380]  well they could have figured out the passcode no they're saying they hacked
[01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:32.380]  into the Twitter system there are hundreds of cyber security companies
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:35.380]  well there's really thousands that try to get contracts but hundreds of big
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:39.460]  ones tens of billions a year conservatively well it's hundreds of
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:44.180]  billions really are spent on this and some of it legitimately a lot of it is
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:49.100]  not these are the companies that stand to gain to hire an outside group to do it
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:53.540]  so it doesn't even need to be the Pentagon this hacking itself but the
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:58.500]  articles up on info wars.com ISIS hack of Pentagon Twitter accounts traced back
[01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:01.860]  to Maryland according to the group which affiliates itself with anonymous the
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:05.860]  ISIS hack of the Pentagon Twitter accounts traces back to Maryland home of
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:11.740]  the National Security Agency Twitter and YouTube accounts belong to US military
[01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:14.980]  command that oversees operations the Middle East reportedly hacked by ISIS
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:18.500]  sympathizers earlier today with messages being sent out for almost an hour
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:21.980]  before the accounts were temporarily shut down American soldiers were coming
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:25.500]  for you watch your back ISIS the hackers posted on US Central Command
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:30.580]  Twitter feed. USA Today reports a Twitter account from a group identifying
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:34.820]  itself as anonymous said Monday it had tracked the source of the hack to
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:41.020]  Maryland but that was not confirmed by officials that is of course the home of
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:47.380]  the National Security Agency. Okay let's go back to the calls Joseph in Tennessee
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:53.860]  you're on the air thanks for calling. How are you doing today? Good brother. Well I
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:59.020]  have a I just want to bring something to stop everyone's attention I think that
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:04.180]  a lot of people are overlooking this gas price issue a lot of the mainstream
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:08.300]  media and a lot of the alternative media continues to say that that the gas
[01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:13.860]  prices are due are coming down because Saudi Arabia the United Nations and
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:18.820]  sanctions on Russia well I'm I've done quite a bit of research and seeing what
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:24.220]  it does to the United States and it you know I really think it's not aimed
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:28.300]  toward Russia it's aimed toward the United States it's aimed at completely
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:31.780]  destroying the rest of our economy getting rid of what good jobs are left
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:37.340]  and stopping us from exporting the oil making the oil and exporting it and
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:41.100]  making any kind of revenue. Well sir you must not have been listening to my show
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.860]  very closely I'm not mad at you but let me just explain something it's globalist
[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:49.700]  so we shouldn't look at it as Russia or America but globalist interest using
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:55.420]  America and using Russia but you're right Saudi Arabia is leading the pack to
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:57:01.060]  bankrupt Iran and Russia and Saudi Arabia is in a proxy war with Russia in
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:08.260]  Syria Saudi Arabia admits this separately Obama and others have given Saudi
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:13.340]  Arabia the green light to do it because worldwide top 10 oil companies don't
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:17.900]  like the hundreds of smaller oil companies that are lobbying to open new
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:23.860]  refineries and in that bottleneck and to go in and get shale oil frac and new oil
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:28.180]  and gas that is the only part of our economy that was growing and could have
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:33.900]  pulled us out of the recession so yes you'd think lowering gas prices would
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:38.100]  help the economy and lowering it somewhat but drastically cutting it in half
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:43.260]  basically is now bankrupting oil development in Texas the Dakotas
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:49.180]  California Canada you name it and so yes you're right they also want to get
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:53.780]  that through to then pass a bunch of gas taxes while it's low so this strategy
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:59.660]  is admitted but the larger strategy is bankrupting allies of Russia and Russia
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:06.980]  and forcing Europe to start buying BP and other oil and gas they got these new
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:12.020]  super tankers for gas to come in so I totally agree with you that it's a
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:16.060]  multi the globalist don't do things unless it helps them across the board
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:23.620]  do you see what I'm saying yes I just have one last point to make I do know
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:28.300]  that that it has a huge impact on the United States when I'm gonna come back

[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:25.580]  through your calls here the Kurt Askell pops in and back to your calls we were
[02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:29.980]  talking to Joseph in Tennessee I'm gonna go back to him he's saying gas prices
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:35.660]  affecting US economy this is what needs to be known everything is rigged
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:44.700]  interest rates the stock market casinos even Rolling Stone Matt Taibbi who they
[02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:48.460]  glorify in the media is knowing everything says everything is rigged the
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:54.260]  biggest price-fixing scandal ever and it gets into LIBOR and so much more and he
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:59.940]  goes into the real international conspiracy conspiracy theorists the
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:02.380]  world believers in the hidden hand of the Rothschilds the Mace of the
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:08.100]  Illuminati we skeptics owe you an apology you were right the players were a
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:13.300]  little bit different but your basic premise is correct the world is rigged
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:18.860]  well no then you'll learn that they just use Masonic orders and other orders not
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:22.380]  that the Masons were the conspiracy they would use the secret chambers and
[02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:31.700]  procedures as the envelope like a virus will use a cell to replicate in just
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:34.940]  like they'll use a police department the corrupt will to take over if they can
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:38.980]  to engage in organized crime too big to fail because the system will defend it
[02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:44.740]  not wanting the truth to come out there's that natural instinct to insulate
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:51.820]  the corruption but when you talk about the rigging of things it's all public
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:57.260]  an AP investigative report in 2001 had the big 10 oil companies meeting in 95
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:02.020]  96 to shut down and use environmentalist groups to shut down refineries they
[02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:05.860]  didn't own to create an artificial bottleneck to guarantee high prices even
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:11.460]  if there was an oil war and a glut by pumping too much oil so there's that
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:17.900]  then diesel is a distillate of gasoline and has always been cheaper to the last
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:23.660]  five years and is now way more than gas in a giant screw job just like ranchers
[02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:27.580]  are going bankrupt with record low sales of beef but then the meat packer
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:32.220]  selling at record high prices it's a rigged game and it hurts the consumer
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:37.260]  so gas prices were way too high for a while now they're way too low it will
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:42.620]  hurt the economy in a lot of different ways but the only boom sector we had was
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:48.260]  energy and we already have so many other commodities going up this is meant to
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:52.220]  kind of hide the other commodities going up and slow inflation they did it to
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:56.340]  slow inflation bankrupt Russia and shut down burgeoning independent oil
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:03:03.620]  companies and exploration to make the US energy independent as well as Canada and
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:07.780]  the Saudis are financing the shutdown of shale oil exploration all over the
[02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:11.700]  world not just here that's a fact that's what's admitted it's not debated
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:15.380]  Joseph in Tennessee you got a couple minutes to finish up and give us from
[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:21.580]  your research why you say it hurts the economy well just looking at what is
[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:26.260]  done to Russia okay we all know that the American economy is complete shit in
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:30.380]  complete shambles and and I couldn't agree with you more that in that's why
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:33.300]  they call it the world stage because everything set up just like you've said
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:38.620]  a million times well big stuff like global energy it's rigged I mean it
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:42.540]  wasn't totally rigged the Russians in the US suppliers tried to drive down
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:46.140]  prices naturally and the system went you know what we're gonna do we're gonna
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:50.860]  drop the hammer and bankrupt to you how's that sound this is to jack the prices
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:57.140]  up to the moon later uh-huh and and it's just what I've seen is that you know
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:02.140]  Russia has got you know their economy was already fragile giving what happened
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:06.620]  with the gas it completely bankrupt their economy well not completely but you
[02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:12.580]  know they're bankrupt they're going down right now well looking at looking at
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:16.340]  how fragile the United States economy is what do you think that's going to do to
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:20.980]  us since the energy the the energy output and energy sales what we've done is
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:24.140]  the only thing that's really been keeping us afloat I think it was done to
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:29.140]  completely destroy to put the last nail in the coffin of the US economy well
[02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:34.500]  even if it goes on too long and is too low if they cut gas prices 40 50% that
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:37.540]  would have been reasonable for what it really cost to explore and deploy and
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:41.220]  they have a profit from the numbers I've seen it would have been okay cutting it
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:49.460]  in half or or or or or or even more will end up hurting the economy and and and
[02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:54.820]  is not balanced I mean oil is going down to basically below what it takes to get
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:59.660]  it out of the ground and that's the bankrupt competition when cells become
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:04.560]  toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula that

[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:06.220]  renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the
[02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:13.460]  Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces of the
[02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:19.820]  United States to take action and reply. Dr. Martin Luther King the apostle of
[02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:23.460]  non-violence in the civil rights movement has been shot to death in
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:28.780]  Memphis, Tennessee he still has the gun the gun is going to the point of defeat
[02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:32.660]  at this moment. Take a hold of this bomb and break it if you have to.
[02:08:32.660 --> 02:08:41.820]  People calling themselves members of the
[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:45.660]  weather underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in
[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:50.100]  Washington and Oakland, California. They took the babies out of incubators and left
[02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:54.260]  the children to die on the cold floor. Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding
[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:58.300]  a congressional investigation into what happened and acknowledgment that the
[02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:02.700]  Israeli Air Force bombed a US intelligence Navy ship. The death of
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:06.420]  bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:10.740]  effort to defeat Al Qaeda. The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:14.940]  a US helicopter. More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:19.540]  morning that most of them are US Navy SEALs. There may be a false flag incident
[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:25.460]  where a ship goes down and used for the excuse to accelerate the next war. If
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:28.900]  there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:32.940]  everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout. The Department of
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:37.620]  Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree. It comes out to
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:43.740]  like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. Today, it is infinitely easier to kill
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:48.180]  a million people than to control a million people. They estimated that they
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:52.860]  would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers. And when I
[02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:56.460]  say eliminate, I mean kill. I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:10:04.700]  up. This isn't a game. From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex
[02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:10.900]  Jones. It is estimated by Lancet British Medical Journal and others that in the
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:16.900]  four and a half year staged Western backed civil war in Syria, 350 plus
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:22.420]  thousand people have been killed. Upwards of 200 plus thousand of those being
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:27.700]  innocent civilians, most of the casualties being carried out by Al Qaeda or Al
[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:34.500]  Qaeda is affiliated to groups. Almost 100% of the Syrian Free Army that John
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:37.540]  McCain and others have met with and financed and given more than $10
[02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:45.340]  million of U.S. taxpayer money so far. Almost all of them are Al Qaeda. They fly
[02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:49.420]  Al Qaeda flags. You name it. Now we learn the girlfriend of three of the supposed
[02:10:49.420 --> 02:10:54.220]  Paris shooters has fled through Turkey, even though she's on no fly list and was
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:11:00.180]  able to get days ago into Syria, their home base where they control about a
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:08.100]  third of the country in the east of Syria into the west of Iraq. Huge convoys
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:11.620]  that invaded Iraq were allowed to invade. Nothing was done. Now they airdrop them
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:16.700]  weapons and now we learn Paris shooters trained and we have these clips with
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:22.280]  underwear bomber Patsy. Evidence reveals CIA, FBI complicit in allowing
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:25.860]  Paris shooting to happen. Now we have Colonel Schaefer from years ago who
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:31.220]  ran the unit Huntington-Lotten and he was twice not allowed to kill him saying
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:36.180]  that yes, Amar al-Laki is a double triple agent of our government. He's the guy
[02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:40.500]  that ran Hassan that ran the underwear bomber and that is now running these
[02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:45.900]  idiots who were allowed to have rocket launchers and machine guns and had
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:50.900]  Facebook's planning terror attacks but we need more cyber security and 10,000
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:55.020]  troops on the streets of France and troops here and Obama has now introduced
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:12:02.100]  legislation, he's pushing for it, that is SOPA and SISPA by a new name. That's the
[02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:07.140]  headline info wars dot com. That story just went live so you can see the new
[02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:14.540]  leg of financing and opening up radical Islamists. Now Kurt Haskell is a
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:18.740]  successful lawyer along with his wife and he survived the Christmas Day
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:22.740]  underwear bombing and witnessed it all. A month and a half after he said he saw
[02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:27.220]  a U.S. person get him on the plane without proper identification, it was
[02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:31.020]  admitted in Congress. We played those clips yesterday. I wanted to get him on,
[02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:35.300]  he's now run for Congress and failed, tried to fix things that way, left
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:41.820]  Detroit, he's moved to Costa Rica. But frankly I want to go join him. I've
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:45.900]  pledged to stay here until the end. As Churchill said, we shall go on to the
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:50.220]  end, whatever the cost may be, we shall defend our island, we shall never
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:55.140]  surrender. Well I will go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, I will defend
[02:12:55.140 --> 02:12:59.740]  the Republic, I will go on to the end, I will never surrender. And I'm not saying
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:04.260]  he surrendered, he does a weekly radio show, updates his website, a lot of expats
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:10.140]  are down there, beautiful place to go. I want to move down there but I just, I
[02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:15.020]  just got to stay in Texas and be sick from a cedar pollen. But we go now to
[02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:19.620]  Kurt Haskell, I'm going to give him the floor to talk about the latest events,
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:23.900]  Paris, what he saw, what happened to him. I got to tell you man, you were never
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:28.500]  fat but you've lost a lot of weight and you look like Dana White of the UFC
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:32.340]  now, don't beat me up. How long you been in Costa Rica? Looks like it's been good
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:37.020]  for you, you lost a lot of weight, look like you're 10 years younger. Yeah, eight
[02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:42.180]  months now. Yeah, you know it helps staying in shape when you don't work and
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:46.700]  you get the proper amount of rest and the proper diet and you know when you go
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:50.540]  to the gym every day you can give it your all so it helps a lot. Well you got
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:54.180]  the floor brother for this segment and the next. Alright. You want to start back
[02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:59.260]  at the beginning of the underwear bombing you witnessed? You want to? Well, just a
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:05.500]  couple quick thoughts on that. I really want to talk about Paris more but for
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:10.540]  your listeners that don't know, you know I spent two years and 2,000 hours my own
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:15.740]  time investigating the underwear bomber case so my conclusions that I finally
[02:14:15.740 --> 02:14:22.460]  drew in that case weren't just made on a whim. I thoroughly put a lot of my own
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:27.380]  time into figuring out why this happened to us and what my ultimate
[02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:32.100]  conclusion was was that this CIA put the underwear bomber on our plane
[02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:37.700]  intentionally knowing that they had provided him a defective bomb that would
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:41.620]  light a small fire on our plane but knowing that it didn't have a detonator
[02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:47.900]  that would blow up and blow the plane out of the sky so with Umar
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:53.140]  thinking that himself he was a terrorist but of course you know he was very
[02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:57.780]  uneducated and never would have had the capability to pull off a plot such as
[02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:04.980]  this without CIA help and of course he had a defective bomb so there was never
[02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:09.900]  really any threat that the plane would go down so that was my ultimate
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:17.300]  conclusion. Now we have the media saying that the parachuters are tied to the
[02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:21.060]  underwear bomber and one of them was actually his roommate apparently while
[02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:26.340]  being radicalized somewhere in Europe. Well you know that's a that's a big
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:30.340]  red flag to me because I proved the underwear bomber was a false flag and
[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:33.900]  there was as you mentioned admissions in Congress that he was put on the plane
[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:39.100]  intentionally so to me the underwear bombers approved false flag tying the
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:43.620]  parachuting into that proves that one is also a false flag but you know we have
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:49.620]  a lot of other questionable things with the parachuting that tie into other
[02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:54.900]  false flags or corrupt plots you know the one that's a big red flag to me is
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:16:00.220]  the dropped ID card I mean come on where did we see this before at the World
[02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:06.420]  Trade Center 9-11 you know with the drop passport found in the burning rubble of
[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:10.620]  the World Trade Center so to me that's another huge red flag what that tells me
[02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:18.540]  is whoever put that there is pointing the finger incorrectly at Muslim so what
[02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:22.860]  that tells me is Muslims did not perpetrate this attack at all it's it's
[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:27.300]  meant to create a false story much of the information we're being fed by the
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:32.940]  mainstream media in these attacks will be intentionally false to pay in a false
[02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:35.860]  narrative so that's a big one for me because we've seen it before with
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:41.540]  another fake attack 9-11 not saying nobody died in 9-11 of course not what
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:46.660]  I'm saying is the wrong people were meant to be the patsies in that case so
[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:50.660]  here we have it again so what we take out of that Muslims did not commit
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:54.820]  this that or at least they weren't the major planners so we have that and then
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:59.340]  we just have the utter we have the size to the underwear bomber we have that too
[02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:04.100]  and then we just have the utter unbelievable of the story so let's
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:07.540]  start out with the story I'll go through some points that I just think are
[02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:13.860]  ridiculous they they go into Charlie Hebdo offices they have a woman hostage
[02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:20.580]  they take outside to get in fine okay believable next we're told they instead
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:25.820]  of demanding that she take them to the Charlie Hebdo office they go to the
[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:31.300]  front desk and ask where the office is what this is just ridiculous you know
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:34.980]  the nonsense this would never happen in real life you point the gun at the
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:39.100]  woman's head and you say take me to the office you don't go and ask for directions
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:45.340]  at the front desk so ridiculous not not credible to me okay next we have they go
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:50.100]  upstairs they are already knew an important meeting was apparently going
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:54.820]  on all the major players from the magazine were in a meeting which they
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:59.260]  do only once a week I guess the rest of the week they work at home so they knew
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:04.220]  something was going on ahead of time and then we're told they call out the
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:08.980]  names of the people they want to shoot not really what Muslim extremists do
[02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:13.980]  Muslim extremists would open the door and shoot everybody in the room so that
[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:19.180]  that doesn't sit right with me either they also wouldn't flee after the attack
[02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:24.900]  they'd wait and die in a glorious jihad right or maybe blow up the whole
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:29.780]  building you know and something like that in a suicide bomb that's more in
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:35.140]  line with what crazy Muslims would do so we're told that they have a precision
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:40.500]  attack here killing the names on the list okay if you believe that fine but
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:45.020]  then how do 11 people get wounded in the Charlie Hebdo offices I mean how many
[02:18:45.020 --> 02:18:50.660]  people were wounded in the Sandy Hook shooting three 26 dead three wounded in
[02:18:50.660 --> 02:18:55.340]  Sandy Hook and here in a precise precision shooting 10 dead 11 wounded
[02:18:55.340 --> 02:19:01.620]  no so somebody's lying there or I don't know why it's conflicting stories so
[02:19:01.620 --> 02:19:08.020]  that tells me we're not being told the real story by somebody okay then they
[02:19:08.020 --> 02:19:15.260]  leave fine but now there's only evidence of two I mean there's video of when
[02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:19.340]  they leave outside they get it in the two shootouts with cops fine but where's
[02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:23.140]  guy number three you know we're told right away that there's three of them
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:27.940]  he's nowhere to be seen anywhere he's not in the escape car he's not in the
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:32.500]  building the witnesses don't see him matter of fact one of the witnesses in
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:36.060]  Charlie Hebdo said one of the perpetrators had blue eyes and the
[02:19:36.060 --> 02:19:41.140]  three suspects name all have brown eyes low and behold one of them the kid and
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:44.860]  he's in school during the shooting and it's impossible and now we have a police
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:49.660]  chief that was involved in investigating killing himself while writing the report
[02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:55.540]  yeah of course stay there I mean I know they've got radical Muslims to me it
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:58.340]  looks like they just financed them to do this you're saying it may be totally
[02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:03.020]  fake the human body is extraordinary despite all the stress as we inflict

[02:24:20.900 --> 02:24:26.780]  the pride and I hope that Republicans out there don't have pride if we get a
[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:32.060]  Chris Christie or a Jeb Bush and go well at least it didn't know Obama or at
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:37.700]  least it didn't Hillary I don't like Jeb but he's better than Hillary I don't
[02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:40.660]  know it'd be better to have Hillary because folks are really angry and
[02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:46.140]  sick of it she couldn't get Jack squat done I'm thinking about beating these
[02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:50.740]  people not being played by them if the system wants Jeb Bush over Hillary
[02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:56.500]  there's a reason for that that's another debate we're gonna have mr. Haskell

[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:15.340]  interesting comments like gas prices works in a refinery once I bought the
[02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:19.220]  economy that's Wildman Blake once talk about the parachuting truth writer
[02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:24.820]  once about hacking and 9-11 Blake once talk about Bobby once about collapse of
[02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:29.180]  the dollar that's all coming up but finishing up with questions about Paris
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:35.100]  when you say Muslims didn't do it I would agree the West has financed the
[02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:39.380]  takeover of regions giving the weapons to radicals he haughties that do come out
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:43.100]  of Saudi Arabia they're allowing these people to fly back and forth out of the
[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:47.500]  West they're recruiting Western terror armies to now attack us to complete the
[02:25:47.500 --> 02:25:51.540]  police state takeover that's all clear but are you saying from your research
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:55.300]  you're smart guy I mean Mutala wanted to call you in the trial till they blocked
[02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:59.820]  it we shouldn't forget that and what you said got confirmed in Congress so I
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:04.340]  know you're an accurate guy but your gut really tells you these guys may not
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:08.940]  have even been involved or what are you saying no I want to be really clear on
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:16.020]  it kind of complicated how I see these going down I see that the US and and or
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:21.180]  Israel however you want to take it I most of the plots I think works have been
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:25.540]  CIA plots this particular plot I think it's a massage plot I can get into why
[02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:30.700]  if you want me to but anyway I think what they're doing they're taking these
[02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:35.860]  stupid uneducated Muslims they're hand-picking some and they're having
[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:43.420]  undercover CIA massage agents whoever radicalized them in Europe believing
[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:48.780]  that the undercover agents are actually Al Qaeda ISIS whoever they're taking
[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:54.180]  them in these camps whatever you want to call them they're having to make videos
[02:26:54.180 --> 02:27:00.300]  and when the time it comes that they're needed to be a Patsy then all of a sudden
[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:06.900]  they get a call from bin Laden al-Laki whoever the most holiest CIA agent would
[02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:13.020]  be at that time to demand that they go to do their mission and then they hand
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:18.380]  pick whichever ones you know best at that particular mission and by the way we
[02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:21.740]  know that's what they've done in the past with a sign the underwear bomb or
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:25.100]  the rest of them so you're absolutely right and I believe that's what went on
[02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:31.220]  so it's not completely accurate to say Muslims aren't involved they do carry
[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:35.820]  out the attack some of them or at least parts of them are real not all of them
[02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:41.500]  but to stay there the Muslims are doing the attacks is not correct because
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:47.940]  without training financing planning of the events inside information none of
[02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:52.060]  these events would take place they're the useful idiots that are done enough to
[02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:56.260]  carry it out yes that's all they are but it's not completely correct to say
[02:27:56.260 --> 02:28:01.380]  Muslims aren't involved because they are but without that helping hand there
[02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:04.220]  would be none of these that sure well no I totally agree with your analysis and
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:08.180]  that's pretty much what I see going on here I don't right I mean I know I've
[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:12.500]  seen UPI and AP and Jerusalem post headlines that Israel created fake Al
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:20.460]  Qaeda groups in the in 1992 to counter Hamas and that's on record that Israel
[02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:24.580]  a stage false bombings on itself that's not me that's the Jerusalem post and
[02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:30.420]  Haritz so I don't put it past Israel or elements of it to get sympathy just like
[02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:33.860]  a black dorm might burn a cross out front to get you know extra money or
[02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:38.460]  something I get people doing things for sympathy people wounding themselves it's
[02:28:38.460 --> 02:28:44.540]  very common in psychology how do you say it's CIA or Assad this one I think is
[02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:50.340]  Assad and here's why okay so you have the the France vote to recognize Palestine
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:56.260]  as a state which allows them to go into the International Criminal Court now and
[02:28:56.260 --> 02:29:02.300]  bring proceedings against Israel now before that vote Netanyahu threatened
[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:06.660]  France saying if they voted for this there would be grave consequences so
[02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:11.300]  let's think about what grave consequences from Israel to France would be
[02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:15.340]  well obviously they're not going to go bomb France they're not that open about
[02:29:15.340 --> 02:29:21.180]  it they would do something via the Mossad so you know if if I threaten your
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:26.180]  family Alex and say if you take a particular action and then you do that
[02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:30.060]  and then 12 members of your family end up dead shortly thereafter who are the
[02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:34.220]  police going to come look after me I'll be suspect number one stay there keep

[02:33:51.460 --> 02:34:00.300]  over again the motive by totalitarians in government by despotic pushers used to
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:05.420]  allow these attacks to take place and to stir them up and they usually find the
[02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:11.300]  same narcissistic egomaniac low IQ dum-dums to do it just like the FBI has
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:14.460]  been caught the New York Times reported on it hatching almost every major
[02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:22.700]  terror plot sometimes with people with 70 and 75 IQs mentally retarded people
[02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:27.860]  remember the FBI famously it's gonna be like 10 years ago it's nine years ago
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:35.380]  2006 got a bunch of black street kids who were homeless and 20 down to about
[02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:42.860]  16 who were Christians they were pothead Rastafarians they they dealt pot and for
[02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:46.820]  a year and a half the FBI got him a warehouse gave him hundreds of thousands
[02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:52.020]  of dollars some cases a month all the weed they could smoke all the beer big
[02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:56.300]  screen TVs and had a fake Rastafarian lead them and say we must convert to
[02:34:56.300 --> 02:35:01.860]  Islam or I won't give you more money and more weed and we must blow up the FBI
[02:35:01.860 --> 02:35:08.060]  building in Miami and the news was like a virtual army to take down America and
[02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:12.340]  destroy everything was been and then it came out in court they could not tie
[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:17.380]  their shoelaces and a bunch of them were on welfare and were raided as mentally
[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:25.500]  retarded and the same story repeats time and time again the guys that drove the
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:29.660]  truck bomb in 93 and I had the former federal informant Ahmad Salam on earlier
[02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:43.340]  this week one up and had a 71 IQ and one had an 80 IQ 70 is mentally retarded so
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:46.660]  you need to understand the guys I saw doing the shooting did not look stupid
[02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:52.940]  so I don't know what's going on I just cannot believe how bold all this is but
[02:35:52.940 --> 02:35:56.460]  look how everything's rolling out how the PR is all prepared when you have a terror
[02:35:56.460 --> 02:35:59.780]  attack and then have a bunch of legislation ready there's not a big push
[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:03.820]  sometimes it's a real attack but when it's all ready to go and you see the
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:07.900]  rollout that's the big sign for me so you've gotten up to the point of talking
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:12.380]  about how they recruit them how they set them up how they use Yemen and other
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:18.580]  areas captured in Syria as training grounds they have these handlers that's
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:22.340]  on record they're allowed to fly even though no fly list because other good
[02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:25.660]  agencies and subgroups identify them and put them on list and then the higher
[02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:29.060]  ups are like oh no let them travel please continue and then I want to talk
[02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:33.780]  about why you decided to evacuate the United States and how you're locking
[02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:38.180]  Costa Rica and some of your views on the world Kurt Haskell again survivor of
[02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:41.140]  the underwear bombing and blew the whistle on it with his wife also a lawyer
[02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:46.740]  go ahead so I get I've given the motive for Assad to do this now I'll give you
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:51.260]  the evidence that I think shows that they did it so first of all we have the
[02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:55.860]  dropped ID card pointing to a Muslim doing this which I think is nonsense
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:37:03.340]  okay but along with the ID card various evidence used in the shooting was there
[02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:09.340]  that they they allegedly used to pick DNA off of and within a couple hours they
[02:37:09.340 --> 02:37:14.300]  run it through DNA database and now they have names and pictures of all three
[02:37:14.300 --> 02:37:19.180]  suspects within a couple hours they're putting on TV utterly nonsense but where
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:24.220]  did we see this before we saw it at 9-11 so but the reason for that was that
[02:37:24.220 --> 02:37:29.980]  there was a very quick need to point the finger away from Israel because what I
[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:34.620]  said earlier because of the boat that directly points the finger to Israel's
[02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:38.340]  being the most likely perpetrator of this attack so we have the immediate need
[02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:44.860]  to identify Muslims and show their pictures okay next we have Kula lobby
[02:37:44.860 --> 02:37:48.580]  now there's no evidence that I've seen anywhere that shows Kula lobby involved
[02:37:48.580 --> 02:37:53.980]  in the shooting whatsoever the third guy he's the black guy you know then there's
[02:37:53.980 --> 02:37:57.140]  the two kawachi brothers but all the videos they're shooting only show two
[02:37:57.140 --> 02:38:02.940]  guys so what what this cool lobby attack well he goes into a kosher grocery
[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:10.260]  store of course okay completely what I would expect while he's in there he does
[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:14.580]  two miraculous things he talks to a radio station hangs up the phone but he
[02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:17.900]  doesn't hang it up all the way so the radio station can listen to what he's
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:22.780]  saying there and then he has a phone call with CNN are you kidding me CNN
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:28.300]  while he's holding hostages so there it's utterly unbelievable but what he says
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:33.700]  is he says he's a co-conspirator with the kawachi brothers and he's part of
[02:38:33.700 --> 02:38:41.580]  ISIS so what this does is this ties in Kula lobby attack on Jewish people kosher
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:48.140]  grocery store with the two brothers that allegedly perpetrated Charlie Hebdo so
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:54.700]  what we have it's a subliminal message here Israel did not do this here the
[02:38:54.700 --> 02:38:59.780]  Muslims and Israel would not kill or people the kosher grocery store that
[02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:04.740]  Kula lobby is alleged to do and how do we find out the evidence that Kula lobby
[02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:10.700]  is tied to the kawachi brothers why it's his phone call with CNN so which brings
[02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:16.740]  in to end the question the where we've seen this before the fake phone calls on
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:21.620]  9-11 so we have another fake phone call here to give evidence tying him in
[02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:28.620]  where he does not otherwise belong so that is the extra boom if you will the
[02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:33.260]  Israel did not do this because four Jewish people died in the attack at a
[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:38.500]  kosher store so there was a little extra push needed here to first you point
[02:39:38.500 --> 02:39:41.620]  the immediate finger away from Israel and then you give it the little extra
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:47.340]  push of four Jewish people dying with a guy who wasn't involved in the shooting
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:52.980]  in any way except by this phone call with CNN where he admits he's a
[02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:58.260]  co-conspirator so that's how I tie in the Mossad in this one I think that's most
[02:39:58.260 --> 02:40:02.860]  likely and then the last part of it is you have Netanyahu kind of bringing
[02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:08.140]  himself center stage in France you know appearing in a synagogue where all the
[02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:12.140]  members sing the national anthem for him and it's all over the media and we
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:17.380]  have Obama taking the opposite tactic staying away staying in US not going to
[02:40:17.380 --> 02:40:22.340]  the March of World Leaders which which tells me this is not Obama's deal this
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:27.420]  is Netanyahu's deal he's pushing it up if he's playing it up to the max and
[02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:31.420]  Obama's kind of stepping aside so that those are the reasons I think this is a
[02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:37.000]  Mossad plot well I've had former famous Mossad commanders on the show that
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:43.420]  talked about declassified examples where they would tap into undersea cables and
[02:40:43.420 --> 02:40:47.260]  stuff and then send terrorist transmissions over them to even blame
[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:52.180]  countries on their cables things like that I mean I'm not a hater just of
[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:56.980]  Israel to hate Israel because all major countries engage in this stuff what I'm
[02:40:56.980 --> 02:41:00.700]  saying is I don't want to be identified with those that their whole religion is
[02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:07.220]  blaming Israel if somebody falls on a banana peel but that said Israel is
[02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:15.220]  very famous for staging terror attacks that were then to be blamed on political
[02:41:15.220 --> 02:41:19.180]  enemies they got caught in Egypt famously doing that I mean that's in
[02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:24.900]  mainstream Israeli papers Israel was in UPI did admit they created fake al-
[02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:30.740]  qaeda groups and did bombings at key political times to mess up the peace process
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:38.700]  Israel has also in Iraq and in Spain after World War two they would blow up
[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:44.380]  mosques blaming on other groups to make Jews move to Israel so that they could
[02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:48.900]  then be controlled by the political parties there and so the tactics being
[02:41:48.900 --> 02:41:53.540]  used are the same ones that our own government's been caught engaging in and
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:59.140]  so I don't know what you do though when you're faced with real radical Muslims
[02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:04.300]  that the West has armed and Israel's been involved in that as well they're in the
[02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:08.180]  Golan Heights aiding the Free Syrian Army France is involved everybody's
[02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:13.700]  involved what do you do Kurt when we know governments do this including the
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:19.140]  Russian government stages stuff I mean this is an old tactic it's in British
[02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:22.820]  manuals it's in army manuals WikiLeaks released those the army admitted that
[02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:28.580]  those were real and when prosecuted manning for it they teach army captains
[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:33.740]  who were in covert operations in certain areas how to do false flags that's in
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:39.580]  the manual well I've interviewed green berets kernels he got sued over but he
[02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:43.060]  won a lawsuit who admitted that all tortures not new we used to do it with
[02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:47.060]  you know with electricity we carry it in our field pack I tortured people all
[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:52.500]  the time I just think there's a naive atta out there about what's really going
[02:42:52.500 --> 02:43:00.380]  on and how widespread is so what do we do then about these tactics that we know
[02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:05.060]  we're taking place and again what there is though now a new giant army of
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:09.820]  radical Muslims that have been created so the question is why wouldn't they just
[02:43:09.820 --> 02:43:13.500]  order and deploy some of them into attack and I guess the answer is they
[02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:18.900]  just did well then why would you then need to set them up and have somebody
[02:43:18.900 --> 02:43:22.220]  else do it if you've got an army that's willing to do it why make the operation
[02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:27.620]  so complex well they want to have a look they want to have limited damage and
[02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:31.220]  they want to be able to control the situation I mean we don't even know
[02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:37.140]  honestly if anyone in Charlie Hebdo even died we don't know there's no
[02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:43.380]  evidence of this so for all that we know this could be another Sandy Hook event
[02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:47.660]  where it's very questionable whether anyone died at all so but it's to
[02:43:47.660 --> 02:43:52.860]  control the narrative I mean if you send in real radicalized Muslims who knows
[02:43:52.860 --> 02:43:58.060]  what they're going to do they may blow up entire buildings suicide bombs all
[02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:01.740]  over the place you might be talking about a mass casualty event the government
[02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:06.700]  looks really bad getting for a while defeated by it or absolutely up yeah
[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:12.180]  that's that's not the goal the goal is to have a minor terrorist attack with
[02:44:12.180 --> 02:44:16.980]  limited casualties that can be exploited majorly in the media that's the goal
[02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:20.900]  well let's not forget I went there days after it happened and made it a big part
[02:44:20.900 --> 02:44:29.780]  of my film terror storm they bombed the subway in two areas and the train the
[02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:35.820]  train to places in the bus in one area the leader of it was in my six and was
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:40.380]  protected and then Netanyahu was like 300 yards from where the first bomb went
[02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:45.940]  off and they had visor consultancy with running a drill of the exact trains and
[02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:52.740]  exact bus hit at the same time in the exact place that is impossible so they
[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:56.620]  also run drills in case any other operatives get caught they just say
[02:44:56.620 --> 02:45:02.020]  it's part of the drill Kurt I mean really these false flags are so obvious so I
[02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:06.460]  just have trouble believing it's always the false flag but but then the
[02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:12.500]  evidence just keeps emerging that it is well well my definition of a false
[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:17.460]  flag is the event is blamed on someone other than the ones really pulling the
[02:45:17.460 --> 02:45:23.060]  strings so that's my definition there may be people dying there may not be I
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:28.620]  may be mostly as told or partly as told but what we're never told is who are the
[02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:32.860]  people really pulling the strings so that to me is the definition of false
[02:45:32.860 --> 02:45:38.100]  flag but what's extra troubling to me in this plot is it's the tying into the
[02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:43.060]  underwear bomber because the underwear bomber case in my opinion was definitely
[02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:52.060]  a CIA plot and this case is most likely a Mossad plot so what we have here to me
[02:45:52.060 --> 02:45:59.500]  is a definite link between Mossad and CIA in the grooming of Patsy's and which
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:03.460]  tells me there's some kind of coordination going on between those two
[02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:07.860]  governments in the implementation of these false flag attacks which is very
[02:46:07.860 --> 02:46:10.860]  scary thought if you ask me
[02:46:11.380 --> 02:46:15.860]  well what should we call this video when we posted and do an article about it
[02:46:15.860 --> 02:46:26.220]  tomorrow terror survivor Paris an inside job or would you say expert Paris attack
[02:46:26.220 --> 02:46:32.860]  Mossad operation I mean I don't know if with the circumstantial evidence it all
[02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:36.860]  points to false flag it all points to the proxy cutouts we know they were allowed
[02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:41.060]  to fly we know they're being trained of the CIA handler why would it be a CIA
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:46.700]  handler and now it's a Mossad op even though Israel certainly has capitalized
[02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:50.780]  not letting a good crisis go to waste I mean I'll blame Israel in a second if
[02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:54.460]  they just red-handed admit it and then then Israel's declassified you know they
[02:46:54.460 --> 02:46:58.780]  blew up hotels and blamed it on the Egyptians or blew up nightclubs and
[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:02.940]  blamed it on jihadis I mean that's declassified so I mean I'm not shying
[02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:07.700]  away from blaming Israel I think now you got to look at the CIA because it's
[02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:11.500]  their handler that was over these guys and it was Western governments letting
[02:47:11.500 --> 02:47:16.060]  these idiots fly around I mean I would have to say Mossad then working in
[02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:21.180]  concert with Western intelligence could be could very well be you know I just
[02:47:21.180 --> 02:47:26.180]  look at the evidence and see what is the most likely outcome I I don't know a
[02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:30.900]  hundred percent and none of us do but to me that's the most likely outcome so
[02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:35.940]  then the next question is well are they working in concert with the CIA
[02:47:35.940 --> 02:47:43.140]  government or the CIA was this a joint operation but with Obama not going to the
[02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:48.380]  march of the leaders and all the other factors I mentioned I think this is a
[02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:53.940]  Mossad plot which to me means that the two governments are working hand-in-hand
[02:47:53.940 --> 02:48:00.100]  in the grooming of the patsies or you know they kind of have a kind of a pool
[02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:05.060]  or you know a school for the training of sure we know camp x-ray is a school for
[02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:11.420]  jihadi commanders that's now on record it is just totally insane and I don't
[02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:14.980]  think we can safely say who's behind it I think what you're pointing at has a lot
[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:19.340]  of evidence to it and certainly a major suspect of not prime suspect just because
[02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:23.180]  of the motive and also some of the other staging of things that stinks to high
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:27.380]  heaven I just know this not one but two passports survived the fiery infernos of
[02:48:27.380 --> 02:48:32.580]  9-11 and were found that day on the ground that's pure bull and the fact that
[02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:38.780]  it's been done again I mean does this never end Kurt how obvious this is with
[02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:44.060]  the sad thing is it's only obvious to what 10 or 20% of the population that's
[02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:49.380]  that's what's really sad the rest are brainwashed and won't even consider what's
[02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:52.980]  going on when it's right before their eyes that's that's what's really sad
[02:48:52.980 --> 02:48:56.540]  well more people are becoming aware you already a smart lawyer but now you were
[02:48:56.540 --> 02:48:59.740]  a listener and we're investigating 9-11 and then you saw it happen with the
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:04.420]  underwear bomber and your story got proven true came out in Congress twice
[02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:10.380]  and it just it just shows you how much trouble we're in in closing we were gonna
[02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:13.420]  go to break and come back and take a few calls from Blake and others Kurt I'd like
[02:49:13.420 --> 02:49:16.300]  to invite you back soon sometime to be a guest host when I'm out of town with
[02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:20.780]  some of the fill-in crew like David Knight doing a good job with you but
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:24.260]  but in closing in one minute why did you split the US and how do you like
[02:49:24.260 --> 02:49:29.420]  Costa Rica well I love Costa Rica let me tell you it's a it's a really great
[02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:33.860]  country why did I leave the US the reason I left us is a very simple one I
[02:49:33.860 --> 02:49:38.060]  wanted to live in a free country not where you live for free but a country
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:42.540]  where you can have freedom you know I had my life very negatively affected by a
[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:47.900]  false flag attack and I ran for Congress hoping to make a change and the
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:52.860]  people did not have enough sense to vote me in someone that would actually
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:58.020]  represent the interests of the people against this corrupt government so I
[02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:02.020]  did not want to live in a country anymore where we have such a corrupt
[02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:06.620]  government doing false flag attacks that hurt the people and a majority of the
[02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:10.340]  people they can't see what's good for them when it's right before their eyes so
[02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:14.700]  the combination of all those things and this to me this is the best country in
[02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:20.180]  the world well there's a lot of CIA and FBI expats down there so maybe they'll
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:23.900]  leave that as somewhat free like Switzerland because I've looked at
[02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:27.740]  Costa Rica as an emergency bug out and I'm gonna be looking a lot closer not
[02:50:27.740 --> 02:50:31.580]  that I'm gonna ever leave but I may have to get my family out or do something
[02:50:31.580 --> 02:50:35.340]  like that at some time just because this I'll go to a FEMA camp but not my kids
[02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:38.460]  and it's all going that way folks when they false flag it blaming on the
[02:50:38.460 --> 02:50:40.580]  Patriots that's what all this is a buildup to when they're done with the
[02:50:40.580 --> 02:50:47.220]  Muslims Kurt Haskell Godspeed give folks your website well I co-host a

[02:52:05.700 --> 02:52:10.020]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:13.460]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:52:13.460 --> 02:52:18.020]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace

[02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:40.940]  out they were being handled by the known CIA operative and we're all lucky and
[02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:45.340]  I've got colonel saying he works for the CIA and is protected and I've got
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:50.180]  London Guardian articles and I've got our government helping create this new
[02:54:50.180 --> 02:54:55.020]  Islamic State and then are the US Army's gonna have to fight it now and the
[02:54:55.020 --> 02:54:58.620]  bomb makers will have more money I mean it just it's a bunch of interest I
[02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:04.700]  really think you can't blame Germany or France or Israel or the US just like you
[02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:08.380]  can't blame an average cop for a cop killing somebody in cold blood in
[02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:13.500]  albuquerque those cops have now been indicted by the way as of yesterday who
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:16.980]  famously you know killed the unarmed homeless guy and celebrated his killing
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:20.060]  they've been indicted because one of them driving up said I'm gonna kill this
[02:55:20.060 --> 02:55:24.860]  guy on video just I can't wait to kill him and I'm gonna blow his testicles
[02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:30.860]  off and the other police are like what are you saying I mean it shows mental
[02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:33.980]  illness but you don't blame all the cops in the country because there's one
[02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:43.020]  crazy person and I just it's very unhealthy to just say the US is behind
[02:55:43.020 --> 02:55:48.580]  it Israel's behind it criminal operations and special interest across the
[02:55:48.580 --> 02:55:52.060]  world are working together because this gives them more power and more
[02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:56.940]  control and let's them roll out the cybersecurity takeover I mean here's the

[02:56:52.540 --> 02:56:59.740]  Blake in FEMA region nine thank you for holding hey Jones my brother so it sounds
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:02.820]  like we're not I was calling in to disagree but it sounds like we're not
[02:57:02.820 --> 02:57:08.740]  in disagreement anymore it's actually almost it's a beautiful thing that I
[02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:14.660]  got on right after Haskell because what you guys are saying is just okay so you
[02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:17.620]  guys are perfect what you're saying but it sounds like you have some
[02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:21.140]  disagreements but you really don't what we've got to do is we're going to focus
[02:57:21.140 --> 02:57:26.340]  on who's really above all these people you know it's like he's saying most
[02:57:26.340 --> 02:57:31.140]  sad you're saying you know the term it's the termites right it's the termites
[02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:37.300]  have been put into them but you don't okay and doctor know there's a snake
[02:57:37.300 --> 02:57:41.500]  right that he puts in the bed you remember that yes make the snake fails
[02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:45.380]  and doctor know learns his lesson you don't put it you gotta send a human to
[02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:49.700]  do the job you don't send in the termites to do a specific operation like
[02:57:49.700 --> 02:57:56.180]  this the termites are the scapegoat so that's I think that's the crux of the
[02:57:56.180 --> 02:58:01.260]  difference that we're all saying the the the the the Muslim radical jihad
[02:58:01.260 --> 02:58:05.740]  dum-dums are nothing but decoys absolutely your gut instincts was
[02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:09.860]  pertinent we're right on when you first saw it these guys were too good all the
[02:58:09.860 --> 02:58:13.580]  mistakes they made were planned mistakes just like Haskell was saying about the
[02:58:13.580 --> 02:58:18.100]  telephone call but you know he leaves the phone off the hook those are planned
[02:58:18.100 --> 02:58:22.140]  mistakes what they actually did was perfect operation so those guys were
[02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:25.900]  not you know they weren't the black widows in the bed the black widows have
[02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:29.260]  a purpose but they don't use them for that kind of a purpose when they want a
[02:58:29.260 --> 02:58:32.620]  specific operation done right if you don't know what they'll do when you put
[02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:36.820]  the black widows in the bed or the snake well I mean it's a false flag now a
[02:58:36.820 --> 02:58:40.020]  lock he's behind it I mean they let him fly all over the place the woman

[03:01:34.580 --> 03:01:39.380]  solved documentary I spoke to you briefly about it I know you're really busy
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:45.540]  but did you get a chance to look at any of it on YouTube yes I believe I'd
[03:01:45.540 --> 03:01:50.540]  watch part of that before I didn't go the time you called in about it okay
[03:01:50.540 --> 03:01:54.380]  just reviewing some of the names you got white you know the list goes on and on
[03:01:54.380 --> 03:01:58.860]  you know Wells Fargo what Covey a bank of America HSBC you know AIG
[03:01:58.860 --> 03:02:04.420]  counterfeits Gerald Garban yeah we had all the insider trading you know the
[03:02:04.420 --> 03:02:09.460]  the passports floating down on burned I mean it's just total bull right right
[03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:13.980]  it seems to me more like a Wall Street hit more than anything else when I'm
[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:17.700]  looking at it it's just something just to move great trillions of dollars well
[03:02:17.700 --> 03:02:20.740]  it was it was a cover-up a bunch of Wall Street fraud and derivatives and a
[03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:25.460]  bunch of records that were destroyed right right exactly so I just want to
[03:02:25.460 --> 03:02:29.220]  see what you do what you thought about that anyway proposition 92 I believe it
[03:02:29.220 --> 03:02:34.780]  was the GMO bill here for Oregon went down narrowly so he was ahead for a
[03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:40.580]  while I mean everybody wants it but guess what it gets shot down yeah it
[03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:45.620]  shows a massive election fraud going on and also a lot of disinformation good
[03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:49.740]  to hear from you wild man in Texas go ahead thanks for holding her on the
[03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:56.780]  ear God bless you Alex thanks for taking my call thank you for calling on this
[03:02:56.780 --> 03:03:00.700]  gasoline you know just talking earlier to God Tennessee that and you made a
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:04.220]  comment about why diesel was so high and everything and the reason is EPA did
[03:03:04.220 --> 03:03:08.220]  that and it's because of the desolverization of diesel there's just
[03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:13.580]  another way to jack the price up and it's actually the low end of the distilling
[03:03:13.580 --> 03:03:17.700]  process it's on the heavier end because of gasoline is made from it they could
[03:03:17.700 --> 03:03:21.580]  different components that make it but anyway the long run what it's gonna do
[03:03:21.580 --> 03:03:27.860]  it's good it's helping the single parent families out there the low gas process
[03:03:27.860 --> 03:03:31.820]  they don't see the big picture this is a domino effect and eventually it's gonna
[03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:34.460]  get them because you're right it eventually it's gonna be five six
[03:03:34.460 --> 03:03:39.060]  bucks a gallon but what right now it's the big boys that are falling with
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:44.340]  everybody's cutting back exploration you know aka the jail and the fracking and
[03:03:44.340 --> 03:03:49.700]  all that's cut back the here in Texas WTI is going way down which helps up
[03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:53.700]  the particular primary I'm at because we don't do exploration like desert ones
[03:03:53.700 --> 03:03:59.540]  like Exxon Mobil, Chronicle Phillips and them they've already cut their capital
[03:03:59.540 --> 03:04:07.820]  spending for this year by 20% which and that domino effect affects the people
[03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:14.660]  that do the turnarounds and do upgrades to refineries to expand so they cut that
[03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:19.580]  back well all the people that work for these contractors subcontractors
[03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:23.340]  come in and do this work for these refineries they don't have a job because
[03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:27.860]  they're cutting back capital spending so they start laying off so eventually it
[03:04:27.860 --> 03:04:32.900]  trickles down to the low guy and it's gonna hurt everybody I mean it's you
[03:04:32.900 --> 03:04:37.860]  can see it I mean the same thing happened in the 70s and 80s I've been doing this
[03:04:37.860 --> 03:04:43.060]  31 years it's absolutely a way to knock out the competition and then massively
[03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:47.060]  increase the prices later and they admit that and it's really sad I mean they
[03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:51.140]  should have it was too expensive before now it's way too cheap and it just shows
[03:04:51.140 --> 03:04:55.540]  it's an artificial economy it's like beef producers they can't make 11 but the
[03:04:55.540 --> 03:05:20.060]  meat packers make record money
