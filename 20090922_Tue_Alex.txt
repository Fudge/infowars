[00:32.560 --> 00:38.240]  attempt to remain calm and cover the hundreds of vitally important news
[00:38.240 --> 00:45.800]  reports on so many fronts as tyranny lashes out against humanity on a
[00:45.800 --> 00:54.840]  global scale we have for part two of an interview we started yesterday dr.
[00:54.840 --> 00:59.200]  Lynn Horowitz joining us in the second hour today he's filed a criminal affidavit
[00:59.200 --> 01:06.680]  with the FBI directly fingering pointing out who he states he has the
[01:06.680 --> 01:11.320]  evidence is behind the controlled release of the genetically engineered h1n1
[01:11.320 --> 01:19.240]  virus and the subsequent forced vaccination inoculation campaign that's
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.800]  going on then dr. Corsi joins us in the final hour we've been talking about this
[01:23.800 --> 01:28.400]  for years but people are finally starting to pay attention to it here in
[01:28.400 --> 01:32.960]  Texas and in California and everywhere else they're putting in quotes smart
[01:32.960 --> 01:36.040]  meters that track everything that's going on in your home through the
[01:36.040 --> 01:42.760]  electricity system with algorithms they know off the different power drains
[01:42.760 --> 01:49.280]  and basically what appliances you're using how many people are in the house
[01:49.280 --> 01:53.160]  and they're going to regulate and tax and control every facet of our lives with

[02:42.160 --> 02:46.240]  police are being brainwashed for the final complete takeover and it is going
[02:46.240 --> 02:53.720]  to be hellish they plan a Stalinistic Mao type slash Hitler type operation and

[04:28.280 --> 04:32.560]  watching it and it just tears my guts out I mean I really can hardly do the
[04:32.560 --> 04:38.200]  show anymore they're poison in the water they're poison in the food they're
[04:38.200 --> 04:41.800]  just turning eugenics loose on us incrementally turning the heat up every
[04:41.800 --> 04:47.520]  day every week every year hitting us hard hitting us hard and the poor
[04:47.520 --> 04:51.800]  stupid enforcers of all of this on their mindless power trips pressing on the
[04:51.800 --> 04:55.960]  nerve of power the priest of petty control freak power have no idea they're
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.440]  in the eugenics crosshairs I'm breaking it all down on the other side have you
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.160]  heard that millionaire entrepreneur businessman your congressional candidate
[05:04.160 --> 05:08.160]  and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called here's what you do you can

[05:57.200 --> 06:26.200]  It's a day. May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you? David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR, the police and the underground shallows. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[06:26.200 --> 06:39.200]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job? How dare you?
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.200]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[06:43.200 --> 06:51.200]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue and if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[06:51.200 --> 07:00.200]  The truth rises. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com. It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[07:00.200 --> 07:14.200]  The phone rings and the questions are asked. I've been so sick. Will the life change tea help me? Our answer is always the same. Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.
[07:14.200 --> 07:24.200]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately. Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[07:24.200 --> 07:35.200]  We use results. Life change tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years. There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[07:35.200 --> 07:47.200]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness. This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now. Our number is 928-308-0408.

[08:00.200 --> 08:11.200]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:11.200 --> 08:20.200]  I'm going to be honest with the listeners of this radio show.
[08:20.200 --> 08:29.200]  I am intellectually, psychologically, spiritually reeling right now.
[08:29.200 --> 08:45.200]  I have studied deeply with intense focus different terranies throughout the last 4,000 years of large civilizations of Homo sapiens sapiens.
[08:45.200 --> 08:52.200]  Our species on this planet, terra firma.
[08:52.200 --> 09:07.200]  And I get so close to the problem and so close to the predator class and how they hunt us and how they set up these predatory parasitical systems
[09:07.200 --> 09:22.200]  that I tend to become acclimated to what's happening and to not fully impart my perspective to the audience.
[09:22.200 --> 09:41.200]  I have been seeing thousands of pieces of news the last few weeks that confirm to me that the analysis that I have been giving you was a gross underestimation of the scope
[09:41.200 --> 09:53.200]  into the overall operations of the dark side, of the hell force, of the armies of wickedness and darkness.
[09:53.200 --> 09:57.200]  They are moving quicker than I believe they would.
[09:57.200 --> 09:59.200]  Their program is in full scale.
[09:59.200 --> 10:04.200]  They have turned up the ambient background of their social engineering and their tyranny.
[10:04.200 --> 10:22.200]  And they are now engaged in massive conditioning operations that have increased their propagandizing to an entire different magnitude of intensity and level.
[10:22.200 --> 10:25.200]  They are arresting people for things that aren't even crimes.
[10:25.200 --> 10:31.200]  They are engaged in color of law intimidation and harassment of the citizenry.
[10:31.200 --> 10:34.200]  They are brainwashing the police and military.
[10:34.200 --> 10:42.200]  And they don't care if it wakes people up at their running warrantless checkpoints all over the country taking blood without warrants.
[10:42.200 --> 10:55.200]  They don't care if all over the nation they are arresting people and taking their children for taking a photo of their two year old daughter toddler in their underwear
[10:55.200 --> 10:58.200]  hitting their brother or sister with a pillow over the head.
[10:58.200 --> 11:05.200]  They don't care if it's obviously ridiculous and tyrannical for them to take people's children.
[11:05.200 --> 11:15.200]  If it shows two girls one 16 months, the other two and a half years old with towels over their shoulders wrapped around their waist.
[11:15.200 --> 11:22.200]  If one breast, of course they don't even have a breast, this little girl can be seen.
[11:22.200 --> 11:25.200]  They hit you with SWAT teams and they hit you hard.
[11:25.200 --> 11:29.200]  They are hellish. They are evil.
[11:29.200 --> 11:32.200]  And I ask God to judge these scumbag filth.
[11:32.200 --> 11:37.200]  I just, I just more and more I just cry out to God for justice against these people.
[11:37.200 --> 11:41.200]  They are just chewing through good people. They are hurting so many good people.
[11:41.200 --> 11:46.200]  And I'm tired of watching evil have its way with innocence.
[11:46.200 --> 11:55.200]  It's declassified that the Pentagon in the mid 70s was given hundreds of millions of dollars of congressional funding on record.
[11:55.200 --> 11:57.200]  We'll even get Horowitz to give you the document numbers.
[11:57.200 --> 12:01.200]  You can pull them up next hour to create HIV.
[12:01.200 --> 12:06.200]  In some countries in Africa over 40% of the population have got it.
[12:06.200 --> 12:10.200]  They've done medical tests and most of the people haven't even ever had sex.
[12:10.200 --> 12:12.200]  Most little kids have it in many countries.
[12:12.200 --> 12:17.200]  They've only had their inoculations.
[12:17.200 --> 12:22.200]  Their crimes are so massive. Their crimes are so complete. Their crimes are so legion.
[12:22.200 --> 12:27.200]  That it's like watching a giant army spill through the gates and just slaughter the people in front of me.
[12:27.200 --> 12:30.200]  And the public is mesmerized. They're in a trance.
[12:30.200 --> 12:35.200]  They've been bathed in tyranny from birth and in the psychological warfare system.
[12:35.200 --> 12:39.200]  And they don't even know it as they're being hacked down.
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.200]  And the most incredible part is the police, the military, the bureaucrats, the enforcers.
[12:44.200 --> 12:47.200]  Most of them are brainwashed to believe they're doing good.
[12:47.200 --> 12:52.200]  And others that are leading them are psychopaths and sadists and control freaks and they enjoy it.
[12:52.200 --> 13:00.200]  And I want to tell you something you sadist and control freaks.
[13:00.200 --> 13:03.200]  The way evil works, you are destroyed by your own evil.
[13:03.200 --> 13:09.200]  You drink the fluoride and the poisons in the water and eat the poisons in the lead and the mercury,
[13:09.200 --> 13:13.200]  putting your food by design on record.
[13:13.200 --> 13:16.200]  And you're fed on by your own system as well.
[13:16.200 --> 13:20.200]  You think you're part of the power structure. You're not.
[13:20.200 --> 13:26.200]  But I want to tell the military and police something and I want you to listen to me very carefully.
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.200]  If you will simply go to YouTube or Google, you don't even have to buy the DVD.
[13:31.200 --> 13:35.200]  But in a way, by me giving it out free, it's like pearls before swine.
[13:35.200 --> 13:40.200]  You don't even appreciate it that somebody make over $100,000 film and give it to you for free.
[13:40.200 --> 13:43.200]  But how would I do anything other than give it to you for free?
[13:43.200 --> 13:49.200]  How, I mean, I make these films to reach people and to warn people.
[13:49.200 --> 13:54.200]  I would hope you'd respect yourself enough to watch it in the high quality DVD and try to support people that made it.
[13:54.200 --> 13:56.200]  But I don't care in the final equation.
[13:56.200 --> 14:00.200]  We're able to find our operation. That's what matters.
[14:00.200 --> 14:05.200]  But I would beg you.
[14:05.200 --> 14:14.200]  If you've got any soul left, any discernment left, any spark of humanity and decency left in that fog of.
[14:14.200 --> 14:19.200]  In that poison brain.
[14:19.200 --> 14:24.200]  To go watch in game and then go to what is the end game dot com or in game the movie dot com.
[14:24.200 --> 14:33.200]  They'll both those addresses will take you to the same URL, the same site.
[14:33.200 --> 14:41.200]  And to go to what is the end game dot com.
[14:41.200 --> 14:49.200]  And to look at that bibliography, because when you watch the film and you see 20 minutes of that two hour 44 minute film.
[14:49.200 --> 14:59.200]  The 20 minutes near the end is just where I list in rapid fire, showing you AP, BBC, Department of Energy, Pentagon admissions.
[14:59.200 --> 15:07.200]  Of where thousands of times they've taken our soldiers and British soldiers and Australian soldiers and the Russians are the same.
[15:07.200 --> 15:14.200]  They did it and marched them into containment facilities and murdered them with nerve gas.
[15:14.200 --> 15:17.200]  Now, I want to explain something to you.
[15:17.200 --> 15:26.200]  When you got a government that thousands of times has murdered our troops, just to see if the army and Pentagon medical officers would carry out the murders.
[15:26.200 --> 15:27.200]  That's what it was really about.
[15:27.200 --> 15:31.200]  They knew what the nerve gas did to mammals.
[15:31.200 --> 15:41.200]  If you don't know the people running the system are completely evil and completely murderous.
[15:41.200 --> 15:42.200]  How do you serve them?
[15:42.200 --> 15:45.200]  How do you make excuses for the system?
[15:45.200 --> 15:58.200]  How do you say the police state and the naked body scanners in the airports and the checkpoints and the license plate reading cameras and the smart thermostats on houses in California and Texas tracking everything you're doing in live time?
[15:58.200 --> 16:02.200]  How do you fools sit there and say, oh, we're the government.
[16:02.200 --> 16:05.200]  We're good.
[16:05.200 --> 16:12.200]  When the people running the government murder you.
[16:12.200 --> 16:15.200]  How?
[16:15.200 --> 16:18.200]  How do you not immediately join us in speaking out and standing up?
[16:18.200 --> 16:24.200]  How in the hell do you trust the government and sit there and take their stinking vaccines?
[16:24.200 --> 16:29.200]  How in the world, what is your problem?
[16:29.200 --> 16:43.200]  There are thousands and thousands and thousands of declassified examples of where they would take healthy foster children up until the 1980s, the last time this was declassified because they only declassified over 25 years.
[16:43.200 --> 16:56.200]  And they take little one-year-old, two-year-old, three-year-old, five-year-old, sweet little children and men in white lab coats march them in and throw a switch and shoot radiation through their bodies at different levels, some dying on the table,
[16:56.200 --> 17:05.200]  strapped down, some dying a week later, a month later, their hair falling out, their teeth falling out, blood pouring out of their mouths.
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.200]  And it's the elite's religion.
[17:09.200 --> 17:23.200]  I jog on the treadmill about 45 minutes every morning and I'm watching a Mark Warburg film titled
[17:23.200 --> 17:36.200]  The Happening and I actually know a producer who knows Warburg and before Shooter even came out said it was a film about false black terror and I should see it and Mark Warburg was a fan of this show.
[17:36.200 --> 17:41.200]  So I'm not attacking Marky Mark, never really tried to reach out to him.
[17:41.200 --> 17:52.200]  The point is, is I don't think he even understands what he's part of in this film, The Happening, where the plants release a toxin to kill the evil humans in the northeast and kill tens of millions of people.
[17:52.200 --> 18:03.200]  And watching the film the last two mornings, I haven't finished it, I got a few minutes left while I jog on the treadmill.
[18:03.200 --> 18:16.200]  In different scenes, they have billboards, one where they're leaving a model home community and it says model home, 1,600 and something homes, this is what you deserve.
[18:16.200 --> 18:25.200]  While in the background over the shoulder of the billboard, people are committing suicide.
[18:25.200 --> 18:29.200]  That's what the toxin, the plants release and mass does.
[18:29.200 --> 18:34.200]  And one guy, this is happening is laying down in front of a giant riding lawn mower.
[18:34.200 --> 18:38.200]  He turns it on and then lays down in front of it as his body's being cut up.
[18:38.200 --> 18:41.200]  They cut to the billboard saying this is what you deserve.
[18:41.200 --> 18:46.200]  And the whole film is saying we must exterminate all of humanity.
[18:46.200 --> 18:48.200]  Humanity deserves to die.
[18:48.200 --> 18:54.200]  And an hour and a half into the film, I already had seen that message, seen it on other billboards in the background.
[18:54.200 --> 18:58.200]  And then there it was saying you deserve to be killed.
[18:58.200 --> 19:00.200]  And I'm going to explain something to you.
[19:00.200 --> 19:05.200]  This is in every, almost every major movie I see now.
[19:05.200 --> 19:07.200]  This is everywhere.
[19:07.200 --> 19:14.200]  And they are going to have control bio weapons releases that are low level just to train you to go under quarantine and control.
[19:14.200 --> 19:19.200]  And once they've got you trained, they are going to release a bio weapon that is going to kill almost everybody.
[19:19.200 --> 19:21.200]  Now, I want to explain something to you.
[19:21.200 --> 19:22.200]  This is guaranteed.
[19:22.200 --> 19:25.200]  And I keep saying we're 10, 15 years away.
[19:25.200 --> 19:30.200]  The way things are going currently, they could do this within five to six years unless we expose them.
[19:30.200 --> 19:36.200]  I'm telling you right now, most people listening to my voice right now.
[19:36.200 --> 19:40.200]  Are going to be killed by the eugenicist within the next decade.
[19:40.200 --> 19:42.200]  We are all dead.
[19:42.200 --> 19:45.200]  Unless we get the word out, I'm going to tell you, there's no doubting it.
[19:45.200 --> 19:47.200]  There's no debating it.
[19:47.200 --> 19:55.200]  And you fools argue with me that the government wouldn't stage 9 11 when they admittedly in one program radiated over 4,300 children to death.
[19:55.200 --> 19:57.200]  They will radiate babies to death.
[19:57.200 --> 20:00.200]  You better believe they'll kill you.
[20:00.200 --> 20:02.200]  Are you constantly tired?
[20:02.200 --> 20:04.200]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[20:04.200 --> 20:07.200]  Have you experienced muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?

[24:05.200 --> 24:06.200]  Alright, we're back live.
[24:06.200 --> 24:08.200]  I'm calling Mark Warburg.
[24:08.200 --> 24:17.200]  It's Mark Wahlberg and the film The Happening, where the environment gets mad at humans.
[24:17.200 --> 24:24.200]  The trees create a toxin and start causing everybody to kill themselves.
[24:24.200 --> 24:33.200]  And they've got discovery channel shows about the end of the world and about civilization collapsing and just scores of television programs coming out right now
[24:33.200 --> 24:39.200]  preconditioning everyone with predictive programming to psychologically accept this when it happens.
[24:39.200 --> 24:49.200]  And all these big biology chiefs and government officials writing books and publications about how they can't wait for at least 90% of the earth to be killed.
[24:49.200 --> 24:55.200]  This is a final revolution of the scientific dictatorship to remake the world and their image to play God.
[24:55.200 --> 25:01.200]  And they write hundreds of textbooks and white papers that we list here every day about how they're going to do it.
[25:01.200 --> 25:08.200]  They want a planetary world government to carry out the forced extermination incrementally.
[25:08.200 --> 25:19.200]  There is no doubt, and I just can't believe that they've got the general public fighting with each other over black and white and Hispanic and Asian and Christian Muslim.
[25:19.200 --> 25:25.200]  And they've got us fighting with each other over all of this while they build their scientific dictatorship around us.
[25:25.200 --> 25:34.200]  Now, I'm going to talk more about the scientific control grid and some of the basics of it when we come back in the next segment.
[25:34.200 --> 25:41.200]  But we also were sent scores. We're reading over them, calling the numbers on the documents, collating them.
[25:41.200 --> 25:50.200]  We've confirmed several of the documents. This is breaking extremely important news.
[25:50.200 --> 26:05.200]  Obama is all over TV saying no one will be forced to take the vaccine, but they're making in many cities and counties, police, federal officers, medical workers, daycare workers.
[26:05.200 --> 26:10.200]  They're saying take the shot of your fired. It's the local health department policy.
[26:10.200 --> 26:24.200]  So government is ordering this and large mega corporations in health in the disease factories are pushing this. It is confirmed up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com.
[26:24.200 --> 26:29.200]  Home health care workers in New York required to get vaccinated.
[26:29.200 --> 26:36.200]  We have the policy document saying you'll be fired if you don't.
[26:36.200 --> 26:43.200]  Okay, here's another one daycare workers told she'll be fired for refusing mandatory flu shot, the regular flu shot.
[26:43.200 --> 26:51.200]  They're setting the precedent to force everybody and then they're talking about making the public take it the new H1N1 next week.
[26:51.200 --> 26:55.200]  We'll talk to Dr Horowitz about the health effects of this vaccine and others.
[26:55.200 --> 26:57.200]  We've got Dr. Stan Monteef coming up this week.
[26:57.200 --> 26:59.200]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny coming up this week.
[26:59.200 --> 27:02.200]  Dr. Ron Paul coming up Thursday.
[27:02.200 --> 27:10.200]  By the way, I just remember do is handling that guest and he's going to be gone now in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the G 20 where they have 2000 troops on the ground.
[27:10.200 --> 27:12.200]  So take that over from him.
[27:12.200 --> 27:17.200]  Please jaren and nail that down double check that he's on Thursday because they can get not flaky but a bit.
[27:17.200 --> 27:21.200]  They always change the date when he's in Congress or change the hour he's on.
[27:21.200 --> 27:28.200]  So let's double check that today on Ron Paul for Thursday separately.
[27:28.200 --> 27:34.200]  The Christian Science Monitor and World Mint Daily and others are picking up on a story we've been writing about for years.
[27:34.200 --> 27:36.200]  I'm glad they are.
[27:36.200 --> 27:40.200]  We were sent when we first moved into this office a year ago.
[27:40.200 --> 27:46.200]  The fact that they're coming around without even asking and they now added it on the side of the building, the smart thermostat.
[27:46.200 --> 27:55.200]  And through its algorithms, you can go to the websites of the big consortium that runs all of this.
[27:55.200 --> 28:01.200]  It's the smart meter and go to the smart meter website, the big consortium running it.
[28:01.200 --> 28:03.200]  And they admit that it has an algorithm.
[28:03.200 --> 28:06.200]  It knows what a toaster does.
[28:06.200 --> 28:07.200]  It knows what a microwave pulls.
[28:07.200 --> 28:09.200]  It knows what washing machines pull.
[28:09.200 --> 28:11.200]  It learns the cycles in your home.
[28:11.200 --> 28:14.200]  What you do that information is given to police.
[28:14.200 --> 28:21.200]  If they gauge that you're using too much power in your house for who supposedly lives there, they swat team you claiming it's probable cause for growing marijuana.
[28:21.200 --> 28:23.200]  That happens here in Austin.
[28:23.200 --> 28:32.200]  They raided a famous former UT professor retired of studies fish to the old lady and a bunch of fish tanks in her house and lived alone.
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.200]  And that was the evidence for a warrant saying she was using too much power.
[28:36.200 --> 28:41.200]  License plate scanning cameras, face scanning cameras up everywhere.
[28:41.200 --> 28:43.200]  It's just hellish what they've set up.
[28:43.200 --> 28:46.200]  And it's all a giant grid applied digital.
[28:46.200 --> 28:56.200]  The very chip corporation coming out and saying they've got the patents for implantable medical chips to prove that you've had all the shots you're supposed to have.
[28:56.200 --> 29:04.200]  That's all this current vaccine fair mongering is is testing the federalization of local communities and local police going under federal control.
[29:04.200 --> 29:11.200]  They use any big presidential or G 20 or G eight or fortune 500 event in the city for total lockdown with the Pentagon running the cities.
[29:11.200 --> 29:19.200]  The reports are pouring in mainstream alternative news, violating Posse commentatus National Guard on the streets of Kingman, Arizona, running checkpoints.
[29:19.200 --> 29:23.200]  We're going to play that video later when we're live at prisonplanet.tv.
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.200]  That's up on info wars.com right now.
[29:25.200 --> 29:27.200]  One of the top stories.
[29:27.200 --> 29:35.200]  Panamics 2009 US military exercise to train soldiers impose pandemic martial law.
[29:35.200 --> 29:40.200]  They mean business, ladies and gentlemen, we're being domesticated and acclimated to go under total control.
[29:40.200 --> 29:48.200]  Why? Because they're about to destroy our free market economy to bankrupt basically everyone to make you all go under government control so they can have their way with you.
[29:48.200 --> 29:50.200]  We'll stay with us.
[29:50.200 --> 30:00.200]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.200 --> 30:03.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[30:03.200 --> 30:08.200]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[30:08.200 --> 30:13.200]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[30:13.200 --> 30:15.200]  Food is your only ammunition.
[30:15.200 --> 30:17.200]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[30:17.200 --> 30:20.200]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[30:20.200 --> 30:24.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[30:24.200 --> 30:28.200]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[30:28.200 --> 30:31.200]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[30:31.200 --> 30:34.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[30:38.200 --> 30:40.200]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[30:40.200 --> 30:42.200]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[30:42.200 --> 30:46.200]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[30:46.200 --> 30:54.200]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[30:54.200 --> 30:59.200]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[30:59.200 --> 31:07.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.200 --> 31:13.200]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[31:13.200 --> 31:20.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[31:20.200 --> 31:24.200]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[31:24.200 --> 31:29.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist,
[31:29.200 --> 31:37.200]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[31:37.200 --> 31:41.200]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[31:41.200 --> 31:48.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[31:48.200 --> 31:56.200]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[31:56.200 --> 32:00.200]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[32:00.200 --> 32:06.200]  This is Alex Jones with important news. I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[32:06.200 --> 32:08.200]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[32:08.200 --> 32:14.200]  Here's the story. The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[32:14.200 --> 32:20.200]  Well, here's the bad news. The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[32:20.200 --> 32:27.200]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt. Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[32:27.200 --> 32:32.200]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[32:32.200 --> 32:34.200]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[32:34.200 --> 32:43.200]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[32:43.200 --> 32:48.200]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and is flat out the best course of its kind.
[32:48.200 --> 33:17.200]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com. That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[33:18.200 --> 33:30.200]  Even if you support taking the very dangerous flu vaccines they push every year.
[33:30.200 --> 33:41.200]  Even if you don't care the CDC's own internal documents admit that it causes and has been linked to serious neurological disorders.
[33:41.200 --> 33:53.200]  Is it good that the government is quietly forcing counties and states to make a lot of their employees take it and make nurses and medical workers take it while telling them not to tell the public and not to speak out?
[33:53.200 --> 34:02.200]  I mean, is that freedom? Is it really freedom to have the government monitoring with a smart thermostat, everything going on in your house?
[34:02.200 --> 34:05.200]  Is it really freedom to have face scanning cameras going up everywhere?
[34:05.200 --> 34:14.200]  Is it really freedom to now, if you take a picture of your daughter or son with a towel wrapped around them, they take your two-year-old?
[34:14.200 --> 34:25.200]  Is that freedom? Is it freedom to give you $15 million fines for garage sales if you sell any recalled products having no idea what's been recalled to the tens of thousands of products over the years?
[34:25.200 --> 34:38.200]  So the system is changing all the regulations and rules and laws. This is just a government regulation with the flea markets and garage sales.
[34:38.200 --> 34:45.200]  It's a way to get in the average person's life, just the average hard work in person. You're the target of the criminals.
[34:45.200 --> 34:48.200]  When you have a tyrannical, that's all tyranny means is a criminal government.
[34:48.200 --> 34:55.200]  When you have a criminal government, they want you disarmed. They want you to psychologically accept being dominated.
[34:55.200 --> 35:01.200]  So they just march up and say, we're going to take your kids because the state wants to raise your kids as their government textbooks and white papers admit.
[35:01.200 --> 35:07.200]  You would say, no, you're a tyrant. I'm going to fight you. But if they say, oh, your child's overweight.
[35:07.200 --> 35:14.200]  By the way, in England in the U.S., they've snatched thousands of children from being overweight that we know of.
[35:14.200 --> 35:18.200]  And first, they use an example of some 10-year-old who weighs 300 pounds.
[35:18.200 --> 35:27.200]  And then next, in Arkansas, it's kids that are even a pound over the body index, which according to their index, you've got to be extremely skinny.
[35:27.200 --> 35:31.200]  So it doesn't matter if you're husky. It doesn't matter if you've got a thyroid issue.
[35:31.200 --> 35:38.200]  It doesn't matter if they admit that mercury and MSG and all the pesticides destroy the glands.
[35:38.200 --> 35:45.200]  And Time magazine's admitting that an issue I've got here with Glenn Beck on the cover, Madman.
[35:45.200 --> 35:51.200]  They admit in here that the pesticides and the foods making people fat, they don't care.
[35:51.200 --> 35:56.200]  They're going to take your kids. It's about taking your kids, breaking up your families.
[35:56.200 --> 36:03.200]  That's what they state in Ecoscience, written by John P. Holdren, the White House science are.
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.200]  That's what they state in all these different government documents. That's what China does.
[36:06.200 --> 36:13.200]  That's the model of control.
[36:13.200 --> 36:19.200]  And we have a vicious predator class that has militarized the police, is now domestically using the military.
[36:19.200 --> 36:30.200]  They've basically gotten rid of Posse commentatus through practice, through simple domination.
[36:30.200 --> 36:40.200]  And they have set up a system to engage in predator actions against the people, and they have created swarms of new bureaucracies
[36:40.200 --> 36:45.200]  and sent forth their officers to eat out our substance as the Declaration of Independent States.
[36:45.200 --> 36:55.200]  We know what tyranny is, and this is the most organized, mechanized, scientifically focused, wide-spectrum
[36:55.200 --> 37:01.200]  tyranny and oppression and despotism that I have ever studied or looked at.
[37:01.200 --> 37:08.200]  This dwarfs them all, and it's just now been constructed and built, and the finishing touches are being put on it,
[37:08.200 --> 37:13.200]  and it's being expanded, and it is metastasizing like a cancer throughout the body right now.
[37:13.200 --> 37:20.200]  And its goal is not to conquer you. Just like the Goldfinger quote, when James Bond says to Goldfinger,
[37:20.200 --> 37:29.200]  check me to talk, and he says, no, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[37:29.200 --> 37:36.200]  There's no quarter. This is total domination. What did the Romans do to Carthage after they beat Hannibal?
[37:36.200 --> 37:43.200]  They killed everybody in the city, burned it to the ground, had their engineers come in, their Army Corps of Engineers,
[37:43.200 --> 37:49.200]  their Centurion Engineers, and pulled down every major facility, every major building.
[37:49.200 --> 37:54.200]  And then they took salt, which was money at the time, very expensive, tons of salt,
[37:54.200 --> 38:01.200]  and threw it into all the fertile fields so that you couldn't grow there for hundreds of years.
[38:01.200 --> 38:10.200]  God help us. That's what we're facing now, and that's what neo-futilism is, and literally,
[38:10.200 --> 38:16.200]  I couldn't count them all last night and this morning, if you go to the search engine and type in the term
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.200]  New World Order and Click News, hundreds of reports the last week.
[38:20.200 --> 38:28.200]  World government, New World Order, Gordon Brown says he wants global tax. Prince Charles says you shouldn't be able to own a car.
[38:28.200 --> 38:40.200]  Tax is on this. Tax is on that. And then right out in the open, it's admitted that they want to set up a one-child policy
[38:40.200 --> 38:44.200]  starting with getting rid of the tax credit. California is trying to pass that state level.
[38:44.200 --> 38:50.200]  First, they're going to get rid of the tax credit when you have children because of their expense.
[38:50.200 --> 39:00.200]  And then overnight, England, Australia, New Zealand, many areas of Europe are announcing huge, multi-thousand dollar a year fines
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.200]  for more than one child. In some countries, they're saying children, period, they're going to bankrupt the jobs,
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.200]  get you on government welfare and government control, and just tax you.
[39:10.200 --> 39:16.200]  And then if you can't afford the children and you go on welfare, they're going to take them and they're going to sterilize your children
[39:16.200 --> 39:24.200]  and write the ones that strike their fancy.
[39:24.200 --> 39:31.200]  God help us. This is so hellish. Why do we have to have this happen? We got to get in the streets and take action
[39:31.200 --> 39:39.200]  and speak out against this. But I'm going to tell you something right now.
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.200]  Just like the establishment as social engineers that study how humans operate
[39:44.200 --> 39:49.200]  and how people tend to stand up and resist peaceably,
[39:49.200 --> 39:54.200]  Bill Clinton was put in power to expand every policy of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[39:54.200 --> 39:57.200]  Seamless integration between the presidents after they're out of office.
[39:57.200 --> 39:59.200]  They admit they've been buddies the whole time.
[39:59.200 --> 40:03.200]  11 meetings between George Bush Sr. and Clinton when he was governor.
[40:03.200 --> 40:07.200]  Private meetings on record, totally staged.
[40:07.200 --> 40:13.200]  For a time when...
[40:13.200 --> 40:18.200]  For a time, the CIA section chief in London ran Hillary and Bill.
[40:18.200 --> 40:20.200]  That's now declassified.
[40:20.200 --> 40:25.200]  Then in the mid-70s, when he was CIA director, George Herbert Walker Bush,
[40:25.200 --> 40:29.200]  managed and handled William Jefferson Clinton.
[40:29.200 --> 40:30.200]  They then ran narcotics together.
[40:30.200 --> 40:37.200]  I've had the CIA officers on record, submitted, even on the local news there.
[40:37.200 --> 40:43.200]  The point is it's seamless integration from Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama.
[40:43.200 --> 40:50.200]  Totally seamless.
[40:50.200 --> 40:53.200]  And when Bill Clinton came in and started going after the guns
[40:53.200 --> 40:56.200]  and saying we want to disarm people and admitting it on MTV,
[40:56.200 --> 40:59.200]  they knew there'd be a resistance.
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.200]  So they put Newt Gennrich in with a contract on America,
[41:03.200 --> 41:06.200]  not for America, to act like a conservative,
[41:06.200 --> 41:11.200]  looked into discredit and to derail the freshman Republicans
[41:11.200 --> 41:19.200]  and to make sure there wasn't a real rebellion in the House.
[41:19.200 --> 41:20.200]  It's the same thing.
[41:20.200 --> 41:24.200]  And now they know both parties are discredited, so that won't work.
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.200]  So you already have these giant tea parties and demonstrations happening everywhere.
[41:28.200 --> 41:34.200]  The media demonizes it, says it's all staged by Republicans.
[41:34.200 --> 41:36.200]  It wasn't true.
[41:36.200 --> 41:40.200]  Then Glenn Beck, who had been maneuvered into the position,
[41:40.200 --> 41:43.200]  began sponsoring giant events and then taking them over.
[41:43.200 --> 41:46.200]  And you'll have 2 million people who can't even hear what Glenn Beck's saying
[41:46.200 --> 41:49.200]  at the head of them on loudspeakers.
[41:49.200 --> 41:53.200]  And then they have in front of the media, Glenn Beck and Fox News
[41:53.200 --> 41:55.200]  directing them and telling them what to say and do.
[41:55.200 --> 41:59.200]  Media Matters George Soros puts it up, showing it's staged to discredit it.
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.200]  Glenn Beck poses for the cover of Time magazine,
[42:02.200 --> 42:05.200]  sticking his tongue out, the cover of Esquire, fake crying.
[42:05.200 --> 42:08.200]  He's meant to discredit us.
[42:08.200 --> 42:12.200]  And at key points, to call for Ron Paul Supporters' arrest,
[42:12.200 --> 42:15.200]  to call for the military to be used against Ron Paul Supporters,
[42:15.200 --> 42:17.200]  to say there are no FEMA camps when the mainstream media is admitting
[42:17.200 --> 42:19.200]  they're FEMA camps and saying they're good.
[42:19.200 --> 42:22.200]  He comes out and says they don't exist.
[42:22.200 --> 42:24.200]  He comes out and supports the banker bailout.
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.200]  He meets with Bush more than any other talk show host in private meetings.
[42:27.200 --> 42:28.200]  That's on record.
[42:28.200 --> 42:31.200]  We can play clips of him saying I've met with President Bush.
[42:31.200 --> 42:36.200]  So they positioned him to make sure there isn't a real peaceful revolution
[42:36.200 --> 42:42.200]  through the House of Representatives with the new group of Republicans
[42:42.200 --> 42:45.200]  that are undoubtedly going to come in in 2010.
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.200]  And then in 2012, I predict that Barack Obama is going to be
[42:50.200 --> 42:53.200]  one of the most despised and hated presidents ever.
[42:53.200 --> 42:56.200]  He's meant to do that, to take all the blame for the agenda,
[42:56.200 --> 42:57.200]  just like Bush.
[42:57.200 --> 42:59.200]  And then the next puppet's going to come in,
[42:59.200 --> 43:01.200]  and that's going to be the one you've got to watch.
[43:01.200 --> 43:03.200]  Now, Obama's still got some tricks up his sleeves,
[43:03.200 --> 43:05.200]  a lot of other things he's doing.
[43:05.200 --> 43:08.200]  He's also meant the name of creating racial harmony.
[43:08.200 --> 43:11.200]  I told you, and we've covered this in the Obama deception,
[43:11.200 --> 43:13.200]  that he would be meant to bring in racial division.
[43:13.200 --> 43:16.200]  And he has his surrogates go out, White House operatives,
[43:16.200 --> 43:19.200]  and say any criticism of government health care,
[43:19.200 --> 43:22.200]  any criticism of new gun control, victim disarmament,
[43:22.200 --> 43:25.200]  any criticism of any other agenda, you are a racist.
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.200]  And he goes on David Letterman and says,
[43:29.200 --> 43:31.200]  oh no, I was black before the election.
[43:31.200 --> 43:33.200]  I don't think it's about race.
[43:33.200 --> 43:37.200]  And he sounds magnanimous and friendly and good.
[43:37.200 --> 43:40.200]  So see, the government comes out and says,
[43:40.200 --> 43:41.200]  we're going to have forced inoculations.
[43:41.200 --> 43:42.200]  He liked the big daddy.
[43:42.200 --> 43:44.200]  He says, don't worry, you don't have to, but I think you should.
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.200]  Then they go ahead and push with forced inoculations behind the scenes.
[43:48.200 --> 43:49.200]  His surrogates come out and say,
[43:49.200 --> 43:53.200]  if you criticize them in any way, you're racist to create racial division.
[43:53.200 --> 43:57.200]  The phony liberal talk show host all push it on TV and radio and in print.
[43:57.200 --> 43:59.200]  Jimmy Carter comes out and says it.
[43:59.200 --> 44:02.200]  The surrogates come out and say it, the front men, the shills.
[44:02.200 --> 44:08.200]  But then he comes out and soothes everybody.
[44:08.200 --> 44:11.200]  This is how they operate.
[44:11.200 --> 44:16.200]  This is how they run their system.
[44:16.200 --> 44:19.200]  And they do this on every front.
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.200]  All of his major administration people are in eugenics groups.
[44:23.200 --> 44:26.200]  They write eugenics books, the most horrible stuff you can imagine.
[44:26.200 --> 44:28.200]  We cover it here.
[44:28.200 --> 44:32.200]  And then he comes out and says, oh no, I don't want all of this to happen.
[44:32.200 --> 44:35.200]  Oh, I don't want a global tax.
[44:35.200 --> 44:36.200]  Here it is.
[44:36.200 --> 44:38.200]  Here he is playing the good cop.
[44:38.200 --> 44:40.200]  His surrogates play the bad cop, create racial division,
[44:40.200 --> 44:42.200]  make everybody fight with each other, divide and conquer.
[44:42.200 --> 44:44.200]  Then he comes out and acts like the unifier.
[44:44.200 --> 44:50.200]  Here it is.
[44:50.200 --> 44:56.200]  And just a moment, the video should load for us.
[44:56.200 --> 45:02.200]  I guess we can't play that.
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.200]  Sometimes our computers crash.
[45:06.200 --> 45:12.200]  But ladies and gentlemen, I understand their program.
[45:12.200 --> 45:22.200]  Once you know the less than 100 tricks they play, it's a playbook.
[45:22.200 --> 45:33.200]  Once you understand how they operate.
[45:33.200 --> 45:41.200]  Once you understand how they operate,
[45:41.200 --> 45:44.200]  it's good to know their operations.
[45:44.200 --> 45:46.200]  It's good to know their tricks.
[45:46.200 --> 45:55.200]  But it's also very, very disgusting and very, very painful because they enjoy it.
[45:55.200 --> 45:57.200]  They enjoy manipulating.
[45:57.200 --> 46:05.200]  I would think because we all tend to judge the world through our own eyes.
[46:05.200 --> 46:12.200]  We all tend to, if we're a nice person, if we're gregarious, if we're friendly, if we have a good nature,
[46:12.200 --> 46:15.200]  we tend to think everybody else is like us, and that's not the case.
[46:15.200 --> 46:21.200]  I've actually found that a lot of people who find out about how humans operate,
[46:21.200 --> 46:31.200]  that find out psychological tricks, who get trained by government and industry and PR and propaganda.
[46:31.200 --> 46:39.200]  It is my experience that a lot of people, when they find this out,
[46:39.200 --> 46:44.200]  get a sense of satisfaction and they laugh about it and they enjoy it and they write books about it
[46:44.200 --> 46:51.200]  and they celebrate feeding on people and dumbing people down
[46:51.200 --> 46:53.200]  and using their ignorance to control them.
[46:53.200 --> 47:02.200]  In fact, they write textbooks and debate and discuss how they want to dumb people down further
[47:02.200 --> 47:20.200]  and how much fun it is and how good it is.
[47:20.200 --> 47:28.200]  They understand what makes us tick and it's very, very funny to them.
[47:28.200 --> 47:35.200]  But you see, the higher level controllers understand how to manipulate the low level parasites and controllers
[47:35.200 --> 47:41.200]  and you're just as manipulated as people that are more ignorant, more dumbed down than you, below you.
[47:41.200 --> 47:43.200]  And you talk to yuppies.
[47:43.200 --> 47:48.200]  I found that yuppies and people think they're part of the system and make $100,000 a year or whatever.
[47:48.200 --> 47:53.200]  You'll explain to them how things are operating and they go, I know that, so what?
[47:53.200 --> 47:58.200]  And they'll giggle and go, if people are dumb and buy all this, that's what they deserve.
[47:58.200 --> 48:00.200]  And I go, but you're being manipulated too.
[48:00.200 --> 48:02.200]  We're going into a very oppressive system.
[48:02.200 --> 48:04.200]  Tyranny isn't cutesy.
[48:04.200 --> 48:05.200]  Tyranny isn't funny.
[48:05.200 --> 48:06.200]  It's very dangerous.
[48:06.200 --> 48:12.200]  See, all of us, all of our ancestors come from adversity and strife and war
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.200]  and great defeats and great victories and great struggles for humanity.
[48:17.200 --> 48:28.200]  But particularly American frontier folks were already the most bold of Europe, the most daring, the trailblazers.
[48:28.200 --> 48:37.200]  And they had the pioneer spirit and the instincts and the will to go out and face the truth and face the reality.
[48:37.200 --> 48:44.200]  And so from a social Darwinistic perspective, because there's truth to any of these systems they roll out,
[48:44.200 --> 48:52.200]  I sit here with my antennae recognizing a threat, recognizing a police state grid.
[48:52.200 --> 48:56.200]  I recognize it before I ever read their white papers and their systems of control.
[48:56.200 --> 48:59.200]  And over the years went and discovered their white papers.
[48:59.200 --> 49:03.200]  And it's like reading something I would write if I was doing it from their perspective.
[49:03.200 --> 49:05.200]  I know what the next line is going to say.
[49:05.200 --> 49:10.200]  When I read their psych warfare manuals that have been declassified, I understand it before I even read it.
[49:10.200 --> 49:14.200]  It's amazing because once you have the knowledge, you understand it.
[49:14.200 --> 49:19.200]  But it's so bizarre to read it from their perspective doing it to the people.
[49:19.200 --> 49:27.200]  It's just so horrible.
[49:27.200 --> 49:32.200]  But here's Obama sickeningly playing the good cop on Letterman Monday night.
[49:32.200 --> 49:41.200]  Noticing when they would have the town hall meetings and there was vitriol and general animosity and anger and shouting and pushing.
[49:41.200 --> 49:44.200]  And just unsavory behavior reported.
[49:44.200 --> 49:47.200]  I also was generally speaking, but it would be reported here.
[49:47.200 --> 49:50.200]  See, they can beat our heads in with billy clubs.
[49:50.200 --> 49:52.200]  They can do whatever they want.
[49:52.200 --> 49:59.200]  The system can be abusive and aggressive, but we're supposed to be docile like jellyfish.
[49:59.200 --> 50:01.200]  We're not allowed.
[50:01.200 --> 50:02.200]  It's savory.
[50:02.200 --> 50:06.200]  It's bad to say, no, we don't want something that's unconstitutional and unpopular.
[50:06.200 --> 50:08.200]  Here's what Obama says.
[50:08.200 --> 50:25.200]  A few days ago, Jimmy Carter started talking about this behavior and was speculating that perhaps this unease or poor decorum was because people was rooted in racism.
[50:25.200 --> 50:29.200]  Is he onto something there or is that just something to talk about?
[50:29.200 --> 50:35.200]  Well, first of all, I think it's important to realize that I was actually black before the election.
[50:35.200 --> 50:44.200]  So, really, this is true.
[50:44.200 --> 50:45.200]  This is true.
[50:45.200 --> 50:50.200]  How long have you been a black man?
[50:50.200 --> 50:55.200]  And so the American people, I think, gave me this exposure here.
[50:55.200 --> 51:01.200]  We're going to come back to this when we get back. This is mind control.
[51:01.200 --> 51:08.200]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[51:08.200 --> 51:13.200]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher.
[51:13.200 --> 51:18.200]  Alchivision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[51:18.200 --> 51:25.200]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[51:25.200 --> 51:30.200]  Simply put, 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[51:30.200 --> 51:36.200]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[51:36.200 --> 51:43.200]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[52:00.200 --> 52:03.200]  It is a big idea.
[52:03.200 --> 52:05.200]  A new world order.
[52:05.200 --> 52:10.200]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[52:10.200 --> 52:13.200]  It is known as the Bilderberg.
[52:13.200 --> 52:16.200]  Could their objective be world domination?
[52:16.200 --> 52:19.200]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[52:19.200 --> 52:29.200]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[52:29.200 --> 52:35.200]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[52:35.200 --> 52:39.200]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[52:39.200 --> 52:41.200]  Great progress toward a world government.
[52:41.200 --> 52:42.200]  Most people have no idea.
[52:42.200 --> 52:43.200]  They're not after money.
[52:43.200 --> 52:44.200]  They have all the money they need.
[52:44.200 --> 52:45.200]  They're after power.
[52:45.200 --> 52:46.200]  That's their affidavit.

[54:09.200 --> 54:11.200]  Now listen to Obama here.
[54:11.200 --> 54:19.200]  He says I was black before I was elected, which is actually the true response.
[54:19.200 --> 54:22.200]  That's good propaganda mixes truth with lies.
[54:22.200 --> 54:24.200]  That's the point I've made.
[54:24.200 --> 54:32.200]  Record numbers of white Americans right at 50% who voted, voted for Barack Obama.
[54:32.200 --> 54:38.200]  And so we were all meant to come together and then be betrayed.
[54:38.200 --> 54:42.200]  And that's exactly what Barack H. Obama is doing.
[54:42.200 --> 54:43.200]  That's what his job is.
[54:43.200 --> 54:44.200]  So now he plays the good cop.
[54:44.200 --> 54:49.200]  All his surrogates go out and commit this horrible act of creating division,
[54:49.200 --> 54:53.200]  making everybody think that there's racist everywhere and that everyone hates each other.
[54:53.200 --> 54:55.200]  But the government, it can be the conciliator.
[54:55.200 --> 54:57.200]  It can pass hate laws.
[54:57.200 --> 54:58.200]  It can restrict free speech.
[54:58.200 --> 54:59.200]  It's going to handle it.
[54:59.200 --> 55:01.200]  They're race pimps.
[55:01.200 --> 55:02.200]  They're Balkanizers.
[55:02.200 --> 55:06.200]  That's what the Romans would do in Europe when they were taking over different areas.
[55:06.200 --> 55:08.200]  They would play different tribes off against each other.
[55:08.200 --> 55:11.200]  They exploit differences, petty differences.
[55:11.200 --> 55:16.200]  But then he comes out as the conciliator and then he says, oh, presidents always get attacked.
[55:16.200 --> 55:19.200]  And he talks about Ronald Reagan as a way to manipulate conservatives.
[55:19.200 --> 55:23.200]  And he says, you know, I'm making some changes in some people.
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.200]  And he shows his fingers about an inch apart.
[55:28.200 --> 55:33.200]  The nonverbal message is with sign language, a tiny minority.
[55:33.200 --> 55:36.200]  But he doesn't have to say it's a minority because the polls actually show it's a majority.
[55:36.200 --> 55:38.200]  Disagree with him now.
[55:38.200 --> 55:41.200]  But he implies, oh, it's just a tiny group that disagree with me.
[55:41.200 --> 55:43.200]  Here it is.
[55:43.200 --> 55:48.200]  Well, I think it's important to realize that I was actually black before the election.
[55:48.200 --> 55:50.200]  So...
[55:54.200 --> 55:55.200]  Really.
[55:55.200 --> 55:57.200]  This is true.
[55:57.200 --> 55:59.200]  This is true.
[55:59.200 --> 56:03.200]  How long have you been a black man?
[56:03.200 --> 56:09.200]  And so the American people, I think, gave me this extraordinary honor.
[56:09.200 --> 56:14.200]  And that tells you, I think, a lot about where the country is at.
[56:14.200 --> 56:23.200]  I actually think that what's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes,
[56:23.200 --> 56:26.200]  particularly during times of economic unease,
[56:26.200 --> 56:33.200]  then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up.
[56:33.200 --> 56:35.200]  And it happened.
[56:35.200 --> 56:38.200]  FDR was called a socialist and a communist.
[56:38.200 --> 56:43.200]  JFK, there were all kinds of names hurled at him.
[56:43.200 --> 56:47.200]  Ronald Reagan, when he came into office, he was moving in a different direction,
[56:47.200 --> 56:51.200]  and people were sure that he was bringing the country down.
[56:51.200 --> 56:54.200]  And so this is not untypical.
[56:54.200 --> 56:59.200]  One of the things you sign up for in politics is folks yell at you.
[56:59.200 --> 57:10.200]  But I think that what has been missing from the conversation is that the overwhelming majority of people,
[57:10.200 --> 57:14.200]  whether they be Republican or Democrat, I think they just want to see some common sense.
[57:14.200 --> 57:18.200]  They want to see some honesty and integrity in Washington.
[57:18.200 --> 57:20.200]  I think they're turned off by the shout-
[57:20.200 --> 57:22.200]  Okay, that's enough.
[57:22.200 --> 57:25.200]  He goes on the line, so people are turned off by the yelling and screaming,
[57:25.200 --> 57:27.200]  and they just want integrity and honesty.
[57:27.200 --> 57:29.200]  The image is he's got integrity.
[57:29.200 --> 57:32.200]  He's got honesty when he's lied about everything he said he would do.
[57:32.200 --> 57:35.200]  That's why his support is waning.
[57:35.200 --> 57:38.200]  But there they are injecting racism, injecting division,
[57:38.200 --> 57:41.200]  and then he poses as if he is above the fray.
[57:41.200 --> 57:45.200]  He is above it all when his controllers are giving the orders to his minions
[57:45.200 --> 57:47.200]  to go out and create this division.
[57:47.200 --> 57:49.200]  It is outrageous.
[57:49.200 --> 57:51.200]  And we need to get on the offensive against them,
[57:51.200 --> 57:53.200]  pointing out that they are the race pimps.
[57:53.200 --> 57:55.200]  They are creating the racism.
[57:55.200 --> 57:58.200]  This is just absolutely disgusting.
[57:58.200 --> 58:00.200]  But they want to, through political correctness,
[58:00.200 --> 58:04.200]  cow any debate and any criticism of what they're doing.
[58:04.200 --> 58:08.200]  Before I end this hour and come back with Dr. Leonard Horowitz when we go live at prisonplanet.tv
[58:08.200 --> 58:10.200]  with the members of prisonplanet.tv,
[58:10.200 --> 58:14.200]  when this radio show becomes a TV show at eight after.
[58:14.200 --> 58:17.200]  I want to encourage everybody to remember Camp FEMA,
[58:17.200 --> 58:19.200]  American Lockdown that I consulted on,
[58:19.200 --> 58:22.200]  and I'm one of the main featured presenters in,
[58:22.200 --> 58:25.200]  really documents the FEMA camps, your neighbors, your friends, your family.
[58:25.200 --> 58:27.200]  They need to see this film.
[58:27.200 --> 58:30.200]  This proves the concentration camps, the martial law takeover.
[58:30.200 --> 58:33.200]  Great film by William Lewis, available at infowars.com,
[58:33.200 --> 58:37.200]  or by calling toll-free 888-2533139.
[58:37.200 --> 58:40.200]  Get Camp FEMA today.
[58:40.200 --> 58:46.200]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[58:46.200 --> 58:50.200]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[58:50.200 --> 58:52.200]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones,
[58:52.200 --> 58:54.200]  and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[58:54.200 --> 58:56.200]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[58:56.200 --> 59:00.200]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[59:00.200 --> 59:05.200]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[59:05.200 --> 59:07.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[59:07.200 --> 59:10.200]  reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[59:10.200 --> 59:12.200]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[59:12.200 --> 59:17.200]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control
[59:17.200 --> 59:19.200]  of you and your family's drinking water.
[59:19.200 --> 59:23.200]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere,
[59:23.200 --> 59:27.200]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis,
[59:27.200 --> 59:29.200]  and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[59:29.200 --> 59:33.200]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.
[59:33.200 --> 59:38.200]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[59:38.200 --> 59:41.200]  That's 1-800-691-6043,
[59:41.200 --> 59:48.200]  or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[59:48.200 --> 1:00:00.200]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:09.200]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:09.200 --> 1:00:11.200]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:13.200]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:22.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:26.200]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz joins us for part two of an interview we started yesterday
[1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:29.200]  dealing with the flu and key information coming up in a moment.
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:33.200]  In the third hour, I'm going to spend some time on the open announcements
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:35.200]  of world government and global taxation.
[1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:39.200]  I'm also going to get into the family courts
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:41.200]  and how they're saying if your children are overweight,
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:44.200]  they're going to start taking them, even a little bit overweight.
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:47.200]  And all over the nation, I see these reports every week or so.
[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:52.200]  Now, not only have you shown your 18-month-old sitting on the toilet
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:56.200]  being potty-trained or getting out of the bathtub,
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:59.200]  not even showing their private parts,
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:02.200]  photos that 99% of Americans have of their children.
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:07.200]  Now, if you show your girls or boys with a towel around them
[1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:11.200]  and show their chest, your children are taken,
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:14.200]  the police raid your house.
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:15.200]  This is an eight-minute clip.
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:17.200]  We've got links to it up on infowars.com,
[1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:19.200]  but I'm going to play part of this going out of break
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:23.200]  because you need to know, even though this ABC News report sounds somewhat fair,
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:26.200]  they still act like, well, maybe it's needed.
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:28.200]  And like, well, the family didn't know.
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:32.200]  They took the photos to Walmart, and now ABC News has shown the photos.
[1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:37.200]  It's little two-year-old, 18-month-old younger girls
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:39.200]  with a towel wrapped around their shoulders,
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:43.200]  but you can see one of the little girls' breasts,
[1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:45.200]  oh, this is over, it's evil.
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:49.200]  Now, you go to the beach and you see toddlers running around in diapers,
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:52.200]  but see, they like to hunch you down and get you at your house when you're all alone.
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:54.200]  But they are going to start coming to the beaches.
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:56.200]  In fact, they're already starting that.
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:57.200]  They're going to hunt everybody down.
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:58.200]  They want you in their system.
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:00.200]  Here's part of that clip coming up.
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:04.200]  The couple now sewing Walmart after they lost custody of their three little girls
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:08.200]  when a Walmart employee turned in their family photos of bath time,
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:10.200]  calling them obscene.
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:15.200]  We're going to talk to the couple live in just a moment, but first, their story.
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:19.200]  Anthony and Lisa Damari went to this Walmart in Peoria, Arizona
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:22.200]  to get their family vacation photos developed.
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:25.200]  But an employee there quickly raised a red flag.
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:29.200]  Mixed in with the 144 snapshots were eight pictures of their three little girls
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:31.200]  playing during bath time.
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:35.200]  The girls, then 18 months, four and five years old, were partially nude.
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:40.200]  The Walmart employee called police who decided some of the photos could be child pornography.
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:46.200]  Despite pleas by the Damaris that the photos were innocent shots of the kids goofing around at bath time,
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:49.200]  Child Protective Services removed the three girls from their home.
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:55.200]  But a medical examiner found no signs of abuse and a judge ruled the photos were harmless.
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:03:01.200]  The authorities need to prove intent on the part of the parents, some sort of sexual intent.
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:07.200]  And once a judge reviewed the situation, I think everybody agreed that there was no such sexual intent.
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:11.200]  After a month, the girls were returned, but the damages were done.
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:14.200]  Lisa was suspended from her job at a school for a year.
[1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:17.200]  And the couple says they were put on a list of sex offenders.
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:24.200]  Now Anthony and Lisa are fighting back with a lawsuit against Walmart in the city of Peoria.
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:28.200]  And joining us now from there in an exclusive interview, Anthony and Lisa Dimmery
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:32.200]  is actually how they say their last name and also their attorney, Dick Trion.
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:35.200]  Thank you all three for joining us this morning.
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:37.200]  And Lisa, let me begin with you.
[1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:39.200]  This happened a year ago.
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:42.200]  The photos were taken in August of 2008 for a time.
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:44.200]  You didn't have your three little girls with you.
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:46.200]  You do have them again.
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:48.200]  How are they doing, Lisa?
[1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:56.200]  They're doing really well, I think, considering what's happened.
[1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:05.200]  But sometimes we don't know the effects that children experience and are undergoing
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:07.200]  when they've been through something like this.
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:14.200]  Occasionally, my oldest has a lot of anxiety about going over to other people's homes,
[1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:19.200]  her family members who she's very close with, and they talk about it sometimes.
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:22.200]  They refer to it as the stranger's house.
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:24.200]  I know.
[1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:29.200]  It's been a difficult, difficult year for everyone concerned.
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:31.200]  And AJ, take us back, if you will.
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:34.200]  They're digital photos.
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:38.200]  You take the memory stick into Walmart.
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:40.200]  Tell us what was on that memory stick.
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:43.200]  There were over 100 photos.
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:47.200]  Yeah, there was, like you said, 144 photos.
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:55.200]  The majority of them were from a vacation that we had taken with a bunch of our friends in San Diego.
[1:04:55.200 --> 1:05:01.200]  The photos that were in question, I believe of the 13, only two of them were from that vacation.
[1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:15.200]  Most of the photos I need is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:31.200]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:37.200]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health manager.
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:47.200]  I love their Nutricafé, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system. Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:07.200]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:12.200]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:16.200]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:22.200]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.

[1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:29.200]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz is with us for the rest of the hour with investigative journalist Sherry Cain,
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:34.200]  who helped him write up his lengthy affidavit he's given to the FBI,
[1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:45.200]  implicating who he believes the evidence shows is behind the purposeful release of this genetically modified and laboratory produced H1N1.
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:48.200]  And we're going to talk about a host of issues with both of these researchers,
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:53.200]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz and Sherry Cain, here in this hour today.
[1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:58.200]  I want to get into what's in the vaccine, what the adjuvants do.
[1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:03.200]  I talked to Dr. Stan Montee who's coming up on the show later this week, medical doctor,
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:17.200]  and he said it's really bad stuff that's in there, but also that the CDC has issued a report saying that they believe it's going to peak sometime in the next few weeks as the flu vaccine begins.
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:20.200]  And it's not even killing a lot of people, it's not a big deal.
[1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:24.200]  So if it's engineered, why would they engineer something that isn't that deadly?
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:30.200]  But then the other issue is we know the adjuvants with the anthrac shots with the troops is what was killing them and maiming them.
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:35.200]  So we'll talk about that with Sherry Cain, Dr. Leonard Horowitz, right now today.
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:37.200]  Great to have you both here with us.
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:39.200]  Thanks, Alex. Great to be with you.
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:41.200]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:46.200]  How much can you tell us tomorrow you're going to be putting out a release on several fronts?
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:51.200]  How much foreshadowing or sneak peek at that can you give us?
[1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:57.200]  Well, I think that the facts of the adjuvants, the ingredients in the vaccinations,
[1:09:57.200 --> 1:10:10.200]  hideously implicate the Baxter Corporation and the links between the Baxter Corporation, Safeway, the entire national health care reform agenda.
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:23.200]  You're not going to believe, I mean, it's incredible that America's health care reform agenda is actually being set forwarded by people with intimate links to the swine flu vaccine.
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:34.200]  This is one of the reasons why you go into Safeway food stores today and they're giving you a 10% discount if you take the shot right then and there in the store.
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:47.200]  And when you look at who's in charge, we're going to be naming the names, we're going to be showing you the connections between the flu scam and the health care reform issues.
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:51.200]  And please look forward to it. It's going to be a stunning revelation.
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:57.200]  We're going to ask for a boycott of all bonds as well as Safeway food stores.
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:04.200]  Well, here in Texas, and I know it's nationwide, the biggest chain, Walgreens aggressively pushes it when you come in the door.
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:07.200]  They're like, take a shot, you need it, it's for your children.
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:13.200]  And they've got bureaucrats and doctors everywhere going to schools, confirming the news, saying you've got to take it.
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:15.200]  You've got to give it to your kids if you love your kids.
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:18.200]  CPS is saying it may be abusive, you don't.
[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:27.200]  We've confirmed, we got the letters from nurses, medical workers, people working in daycares and public schools.
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:35.200]  And these are up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com confirming that Obama's a liar saying you won't have to take the shot through color of law.
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:38.200]  They are pushing this aggressively everywhere.
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:42.200]  Sherry Cain and Dr. Leonard Horowitz, what can you tell us about that?
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:49.200]  I can tell you that my latest press release is going to be titled Safeway's Killer Flu Shot Marketing Campaign.
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:51.200]  What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Sicker.
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:12:00.200]  Steve Byrd is the chairman and he's also the president and CEO of Safeway and the founder of the Coalition to Advanced Healthcare Reform.
[1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:04.200]  The organization is called CAHR.
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:15.200]  Apparently they're working overtime to promote this vaccination campaign and they are catering to uninsured low income public and blue collar workers for just under $30.
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:18.200]  You can walk into Safeway Vaughn to get vaccinated.
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:27.200]  They get you in the front door, somebody hands you a flyer with a big smile, tells you that they get the flu shot in their in-house pharmacy on your way out the door.
[1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:33.200]  If you don't go for the flu shot, they get you while you're swiping your credit card, which is going to be a photo I took of it.
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:39.200]  In my latest press release, it's going to show you where they're offering you 10% off your grocery purchases.
[1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:41.200]  If you get that flu vaccination right there.
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:42.200]  I mean, folks, come on.
[1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:48.200]  This, I mean, a 10% off the average grocery bill of $150, we're talking about $1213.
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:13:01.200]  I mean, they are really pushing this with a government with a history of genetic engineering, of eugenics, of poisoning vaccines, of radiating foster children, of black men, and giving them syphilis, Tuskegee.
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:04.200]  I mean, how would anyone trust these people?
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:05.200]  Well, that's it.
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:06.200]  That's the greatest point.
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:23.200]  I think you really have to look at how persuasive the mainstream media is and how malfeasent the officials are to actually say that these vaccines are safe and effective when actually the science disproves all of that.
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:31.200]  And one of the big questions actually is who's actually getting out these vaccines in a safe way?
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:42.200]  According to the Infections Disease Society of America, which is not on our team, they claim that these are travel medicine providers that have no experience or unqualified, untrained.
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:44.200]  They don't know anything about the side effects.
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:49.200]  If somebody is already not feeling well and they give them these vaccinations, they can be deadly.
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:14:01.200]  That's right. In fact, a medical doctor or a nurse will ask you if you've already been sick, if you've already had the flu, if you've got preexisting conditions, do you have allergic responses to vaccines?
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:03.200]  And I was talking to one of my employees.
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:05.200]  His mother is not in the medical field.
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:09.200]  She was offered $45 an hour to go to events and give people shots.
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:14.200]  They're not trained in the multi-use vials to use the needles properly.
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:15.200]  I mean, this is hellish.
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:16.200]  Hellish.
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:17.200]  It could be contamination.
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:19.200]  Lots of contamination involved.
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:24.200]  And I would recommend that no one rolls up their sleeve for any vaccination.
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:27.200]  One of the main ingredients is the MS-59.
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:34.200]  And you spoke about that, which has the sub-micron oil and water emulsion of squalene, which is an adjective.
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:36.200]  And it's unlicensed in the U.S.
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:44.200]  You know, the other thing that the additive that is implicated is IL-2, interleukin-2.
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:47.200]  There's also non-oxyl-9.
[1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:57.200]  What we're going to be coming out with tomorrow are the links between the fact that factors, vaccinations are being produced, not in the chicken embryo,
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:06.200]  but actually in the very green monkey kidney tissue cell cultures with SD-40, simian virus, 40 contaminants.
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:07.200]  And that's not your opinion.
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:11.200]  Build the biggest newspaper in Germany reported that three weeks ago.
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:12.200]  I know you have new info.
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:13.200]  Give us that new info now.
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:22.200]  They have top virologist in the paper saying, look, this is being grown in monkeys with cancer viruses that will kill humans.
[1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:23.200]  Period.
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:24.200]  Right.
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:34.200]  And then now you understand why they're putting non-oxyl-9 into the adjuvant solution because it's a virus side.
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:41.200]  It basically is associated with killing HIV, which is linked to SD-40 in the scientific literature.
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:50.200]  But the medical doctors I've talked to and confirmed this is right, they're saying that with the virus RNA that it doesn't even kill them, that it just still combines.
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:52.200]  That's exactly right.
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:16:07.200]  Well, that's why it's such a risk what they're producing is another potential deadly aid, HIV, because they're injecting live, reverse engineered viruses in the flu vaccines with all these recombinants in it.
[1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:10.200]  And basically it's literally a witch's brew.
[1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:11.200]  I'm going to stop you.
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:12.200]  I'm going to stop you then.
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:13.200]  I'm going to sit back and I want you to have the Florida Horowitz.
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:15.200]  We go to break and we'll come back to Sherry.
[1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:18.200]  But I don't want to just glaze over this massive announcement.
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:23.200]  It is confirmed that they're growing it in the monkey kidneys.
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:28.200]  It's confirmed those monkeys carry virulent virus that they admit has killed tens of millions worldwide.
[1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:36.200]  Government admits that the SV-40, simian cancer virus, and that it's in there.
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:38.200]  And this is massive news.
[1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:39.200]  It's in the German and British news.
[1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:42.200]  You'll never hear it here.
[1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:44.200]  Explain to people what SV-40 does.
[1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:45.200]  Go ahead.
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:49.200]  Simian virus 40 is the 40th monkey virus ever discovered.
[1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:52.200]  It was actually stolen by Dr. Maurice Hillerman.
[1:16:52.200 --> 1:17:07.200]  On YouTube, you can actually view the segment I put up several months ago where Hillerman, Merck Sharpen Dome, Merck Pharmaceutical Company's chief vaccine developer admits bringing the AIDS virus into North America.
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:13.200]  It's in these monkeys that are currently being used by Baxter to produce the flu vaccine.
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:14.200]  And he laughs.
[1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:15.200]  It's very funny.
[1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:16.200]  Yeah, it's sick.
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:18.200]  It's actually on YouTube.
[1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:24.200]  Check out Merck, chief vaccine chief, brings AIDS to the world.
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:39.200]  And so what you're looking at is SV-40, and I have a publication in Journal of Medical Hypothesis that goes into detail about how the hepatitis B vaccines, as well as the polio vaccines, were contaminated.
[1:17:39.200 --> 1:17:46.200]  And that this is what, according to all the scientific evidence, brought HIV-AIDS to the world.
[1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:57.200]  Now, what they're currently doing, another breaking news is that number one man in the United States on HIV-AIDS, he's the AIDS czar for America.
[1:17:57.200 --> 1:18:00.200]  His name is Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:09.200]  He's the co-patent holder on Interleukin II, which is another adjuvant additive in this vaccine.
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:23.200]  So what you're looking at is Interleukin II and its relationship to boosting and actually manipulating the human immune system, combining that with the non-oxyl 9.
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:33.200]  In essence, this adjuvant is preparing the population to be infected with HIV-like viruses.
[1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:37.200]  So it's a soft kill preparation?
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:47.200]  It's actually, it is another mutation of HIV for immune depression and human population reduction.
[1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:59.200]  Well, I mean, I'm no doctor, Dr. Horowitz, but the Interleukin you mentioned, I've read about that as one of the dangerous HIV drugs they were forcing on New York foster children and killing them with it.
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:00.200]  That's exactly right.
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.200]  And the most recent studies are that they're not helpful.
[1:19:04.200 --> 1:19:10.200]  They've tested them in thousands of HIV-AIDS patients over long periods of time.
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:17.200]  It was developed initially to say, well, we're going to increase CD4 helper cell levels.
[1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:27.200]  But in essence, what it does is it falsely prompts the immune response that then the cells are so sick, they don't really respond to HIV.
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:33.200]  They're overwhelmed and the patients die just like every other non-treated patient.
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:42.200]  So basically, and I've read the studies about cancer being associated with an overly active immune system and finally just burns out, gives up.
[1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:44.200]  My God, this is so diabolical.
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:55.200]  And it goes back to New York City with the big Rockefeller Foundation that discovered the cancer viruses and pushed it, that controls the big medical trust that you and your affidavit are saying is running this whole operation.
[1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:56.200]  Stay there.
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:20:00.200]  Dr. Lerner Horowitz and Sherry Kane, stay with us.
[1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:06.200]  This is an emergency alert. Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[1:20:06.200 --> 1:20:10.200]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[1:20:10.200 --> 1:20:20.200]  I'm Dr. Lerner Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.
[1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:22.200]  Rely instead on oxysilver.
[1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:28.200]  Oxysilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[1:20:28.200 --> 1:20:33.200]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:41.200]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family that has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:06.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:14.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:21.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:25.200]  Well Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:37.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:47.200]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:21:47.200 --> 1:22:08.200]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:26.200]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources with an exciting announcement.

[1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:19.200]  The five companies putting out the H1N1 flu vaccine know the army admits that the adjuvants that were very similar to this put in the anthrax shot for the troops killed a bunch of people and maimed thousands.
[1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:21.200]  That's on record.
[1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:36.200]  Dr. Horowitz, am I right in saying and also Sherry Kane from your research that they are fully conscious of what they're doing A and B then what is the master plan? What is the point of all of this?
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:54.200]  Well, the actual adjuvants to the squalene that are included, there's no doubt that the scientific literature slam dunks the contraindications of these. You really again have the scientific agenda that says that this is more toxic than helpful.
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:25:09.200]  And, you know, it's kind of like the same scam of how the concentration camp victims were lulled into believing they were actually going to go in to take a shower for public health and disinfection.
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:24.200]  Here we were allegedly adding squalene adjuvant to reduce risk to vaccinations and increase efficacy of vaccinations and that the science is actually the opposite.
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:48.200]  And I think what the agenda is, again, my concern about this is, and then again, there's a good researcher out there, William Alec, Bill Alec, who likewise confirmed yesterday after our show, Alex, that the most likely scenario is because there's such incredible amount of investment in this scam,
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:26:03.200]  that the authorities are likely to release something or do something that is going to compel the expenditures and the use of the stockpile vaccinations so that even that they would save face.
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:16.200]  I mean, you just mentioned a couple minutes ago that there's really nothing happening. And, you know, they've hyped us all up and they've spent these billions and billions of dollars to prepare us.
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:27.200]  And what's the likelihood? Is this just going to just go away? I don't think so. It's not likely. The more likely scenario is, I mean, I pray it will go away.
[1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:37.200]  I pray that nothing will happen and I pray that the government would simply cease and desist based on the several litigations that have been filed even in the United States now.
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:48.200]  Well, Dr. Horowitz, look at the political landscape. Even Dick Armey has said he thinks Obama is using this hype to pass his eugenics health care. They need their new bank of the world.
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:57.200]  Everything legislatively is coming up in the fall and winter. This is a perfect cover. And we know they're suddenly putting troops on the streets everywhere. The news reports are coming in.
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:07.200]  The amateur videos are coming in of Marines and Army searching people randomly. They're now medicalizing the police under federal grants to take citizens blood.
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:12.200]  I mean, they're definitely built up to show that this isn't just some tabletop drill.
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:33.200]  Right. And, you know, you look at the Wizard of Oz. Who's pulling the strings? And, you know, Sherry Cain can comment in detail on this Mr. Byrd, who's in charge of the organization that's advancing health care reform in the United States, and his links to the Merck Pharmaceutical Company, Smith-Klein, Beecham, all the drug index.
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:36.200]  Sherry, tell us about that.
[1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:47.200]  Basically, Steve Byrd, he's in bed with all of these other pharmaceutical companies, and they are all on the same campaign together to get their message out.
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:28:03.200]  I mean, you know, I want to go back to what Dr. Horowitz said about World War II. I mean, one of Hitler's most famous quotes was, make the lie big, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.
[1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:15.200]  So, I mean, this is part of what they're trying to do. They're brainwashing people into believing that there's this mass epidemic going on when there actually isn't any epidemic going on.
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:28.200]  It's being created by these people, and they're all pulling the strings. I actually am doing research, and so is Dr. Horowitz on Rupert Murdoch, who is on the board.
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:39.200]  And I wanted to make the top heads of the partnership for New York City. And if you check out partnership for New York City, you can link all the people on there. It's like a who's who.
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:51.200]  You'll see that there's people like Thomas Gloster, who is the CEO, the director of Reuters. I mean, we know Reuters, right? The wire service.
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:29:05.200]  This guy is also the director of Merck Pharmaceutical. I mean, the same person that's out there controlling what we say is the same person that is manufacturing these viruses and these vaccinations.
[1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:21.200]  And by the way, Sherry, did you see the Reuters article on September 16th? Flu experts gear up for pandemic vaccine worry, and they say, look, millions are going to die. They're going to think it was from the vaccine, but it's not. It's a mass diagnosis that.
[1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:40.200]  Let me read it. 1 million heart attacks, 700,000 strokes and 900,000 miscarriages. U.S. public health officials want Americans to know these will happen every year with or without the swine flu vaccine campaign. Yet this year, they know a significant number will be blamed on the H1N1 vaccine, which will roll out within weeks and they are struggling to be ready.
[1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:52.200]  So when we come back in the long segment coming up, I want you both to comment on this because they're saying, look, a lot of people will take the shot. A lot of people will die, but it's not the shot on the march.
[1:29:52.200 --> 1:30:00.200]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:14.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:26.200]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:35.200]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:44.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones.
[1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:59.200]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.

[1:32:01.200 --> 1:32:08.200]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:32:08.200 --> 1:32:12.200]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:32:12.200 --> 1:32:14.200]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:17.200]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:24.200]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:31.200]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:35.200]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:32:35.200 --> 1:32:45.200]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:32:45.200 --> 1:32:53.200]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com. Forsee it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:57.200]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:32:57.200 --> 1:33:25.200]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz and investigative journalist Sherry Kane join us right now.
[1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:32.200]  You can go to fluscam.com to see the affidavit and see all the other research that Dr. Horowitz has.
[1:33:32.200 --> 1:33:34.200]  We're going to go back to them in just one moment.
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:38.200]  I did want to tell all the TV viewers that I consulted on this film.
[1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:41.200]  I am one of the main featured people in the film.
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:47.200]  So my detailed research on the FEMA camps, where they are, how they're run, how they're rolling out the military.
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:57.200]  Northcom, how they use sports stadiums under Operation Top Off and their tabletop exercises in NLE09.
[1:33:57.200 --> 1:34:06.200]  This is really a film I'm proud that I'm in and I'm really proud of the job they did for anybody that wants to know the truth about concentration camps in America
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:11.200]  and how they want to use pandemics and other excuses to roll it out and condition everybody to accept it.
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:15.200]  Camp FEMA, American Lockdown, is the film, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:17.200]  It's available at infowars.com.
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:22.200]  You can also get some of my other films at half price when you get them with Camp FEMA.
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:25.200]  And it is just an amazing documentary.
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:29.200]  I hope everyone will visit infowars.com and order the DVD.
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:31.200]  We've been shipping it out since last week.
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:32.200]  In fact, we even got it first.
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:34.200]  We're shipping it before anybody.
[1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:36.200]  And these are sold out in the other places.
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:37.200]  We happen to have them.
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:43.200]  So again, Camp FEMA American Lockdown that I consulted on and I feature massively in.
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:48.200]  This is an amazing job by William Lewis and Gary Franchi.
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:50.200]  And will we end up in these camps?
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:52.200]  See what the experts have to say.
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:58.200]  Camp FEMA boasts an all-star lineup of guests who have dedicated their lives, sacred honor and fortunes to upholding the U.S. Constitution.
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:00.200]  The evidence is strong and their warnings are clear.
[1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:04.200]  Camp FEMA available at infowars.com on the online video bookstore.
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:11.200]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139-888-2533139.
[1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:14.200]  Or you can, again, also write to us.
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:21.200]  It's 1995, P.O. Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:27.200]  Again, that's infowars.com, P.O. Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:36.200]  Camp FEMA in-game terror storm, the Obama deception, books, videos, all the best stuff I've seen out there.
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:38.200]  Not just my films are there.
[1:35:38.200 --> 1:35:45.200]  We also are now carrying Dr. Sherry Tenpenny's book, Foul Revised and Updated Bird Flu.
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:46.200]  It's not just what you think.
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:51.200]  It goes along the same line as the swine flu, understanding the police state, what the vaccines really do.
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:53.200]  That's available at infowars.com as well.
[1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:55.200]  And she's joining us, by the way, on Thursday.
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:57.200]  Dr. Ron Paul is also on.
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:03.200]  I want to get back with Ms. Cain and Dr. Horowitz here in just a moment.
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:08.200]  First, Dr. Horowitz, you have tetrahedron.org, you have other sites, and you have researched this.
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:15.200]  And you have also a lot of fact sheets and other things about how to get your immune system up, how to protect your body.
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:19.200]  Tell us the best site to learn about your books, your films, your materials.
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:33.200]  Well, the best preventative that I recommend is oxysilver.com, and the best place to order it is online at 888-508-4787.
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:41.200]  I'm sorry, for people who are not on the internet, they can call toll-free 888-508-4787.
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:42.200]  I don't worry personally.
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:46.200]  My family doesn't worry about the flu because we are covered by oxysilver.
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:52.200]  I urge people to learn about it because it's not just even a top-rated silver hydrosol.
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:53.200]  It goes way beyond.
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:37:03.200]  It takes people into, and actually the first nutraceutical that actually brings you into the understanding of bioenergetics for protection,
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:05.200]  which is where we really should be going.
[1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:12.200]  And I'm going to have you back up in the next week specifically on that so people can go to fluscam.com and find that.
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:16.200]  Yeah, fluscam.com has links to oxysilver.
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:18.200]  Also, the affidavit, like you mentioned, is on there.
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:21.200]  There's a tremendous amount of information.
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:24.200]  There's counterintelligence propaganda flying everywhere.
[1:37:24.200 --> 1:37:26.200]  The national vaccine information...
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:27.200]  Yeah, let's stop right there.
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:29.200]  That's a good next question.
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:32.200]  You're believing they're going to release something.
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:37.200]  Finish up with that, and then let's get into their counter propaganda, their lies.
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:43.200]  I see them on the news saying there's no mercury in it, even when they admit down the article that there is the merisol.
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:46.200]  I see them saying there's not an adjuvant in there.
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:49.200]  I see them just engage in unbelievable propaganda.
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:58.200]  Okay, now you mentioned earlier on, and I applaud you and Charlie Sheen for putting this into the release that you guys did on 9-11.
[1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:03.200]  You know, remember they said they already reported building 7 was pulled before it was pulled?
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:04.200]  Yes.
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:11.200]  This is the same kind of thing. They're reporting that this is going to be a horrific thing before it's a horrific thing.
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:19.200]  Actually, if you look at Ms. Cain's research and my research into the partnership for New York City,
[1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:22.200]  and you have the Rockefeller link to the royalty of Europe,
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:27.200]  literally this organization was chartered by the Royal Family of England.
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:32.200]  When you understand the Rockefellers are behind everything from New York City Blood Council
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:40.200]  to the New York City Blood Bank, that like Baxter's spread contaminated HIV in the blood supplies,
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:45.200]  Baxter, of course, put it out in their cooperation, put it out in Clotting Factor 8,
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:48.200]  and Baxter put it out in the heparin.
[1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:50.200]  HIV, we're talking AIDS.
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:52.200]  Again, these are on-record mass killers.
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:56.200]  They were convicted of that in French courts and didn't even get in trouble worldwide.
[1:38:56.200 --> 1:39:02.200]  It came out in the court documents that Bayer, especially, knew for 10 years it was in the Factor 8
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:04.200]  and shipped it out to millions.
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:09.200]  Again, the history these people have of doing this over and over again,
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:12.200]  and then we're the weirdos for not trusting them.
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:15.200]  Right. So this is why I'm very concerned.
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:19.200]  I mean, honestly, I think that these people's backs are up against the wall.
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:24.200]  We've been out there successfully now persuading the public to open their eyes.
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:28.200]  And so they're really now stuck between a rock and a hard place.
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:31.200]  They've got to, in essence, produce a pandemic.
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:34.200]  They've got to show us that they were right or wrong,
[1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:37.200]  and that's what I'm mostly frightened about.
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:43.200]  Now, you spoke yesterday, and I want to get you to comment on this, and then Sherry,
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:46.200]  that, and this is in the UN press release as we've covered it.
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:51.200]  It was in documents three months ago and four months ago, and this really got going in April,
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:57.200]  that they have these virus simulants, and they use other terms that are really viruses,
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:40:02.200]  that they say they released to prepare people some immunity.
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:06.200]  I mean, and then they just kind of announced this huge issue like it's no big deal.
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:10.200]  Yeah, that was confirmed a couple weeks ago by the World Health Organization
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:16.200]  when the propaganda became thick and heavy because they realized that the physicians already,
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:19.200]  over 50% of the doctors are not going to take it,
[1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:21.200]  and they're going to prescribe it for their patients.
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:26.200]  So when they needed to promote this flu vaccine, the World Health Organization issued a statement
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:32.200]  wherein they actually reinforced what I had already reported with you on this show,
[1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:39.200]  whereby we said that Dr. James Robertson, the World Health Organization director for influenza,
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:45.200]  who was in charge of selecting the viruses for the vaccination companies,
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:49.200]  and that this doctor and Dr. Woods, who he works with,
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:53.200]  came out and actually said that we're going to release in advance.
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:59.200]  We're going to feed the population with viruses to allegedly, they say,
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:04.200]  enhance our immunity against the pandemic that's forthcoming.
[1:41:04.200 --> 1:41:07.200]  So that's what we reported with you, Alex,
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:11.200]  was that the Mexican flu outbreak was the most likely the seeding,
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:18.200]  and that this now transition as the virus is going from America to Asia and then to Europe,
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:20.200]  the Euro-Asia connection.
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:27.200]  Now you've got Baxter, the most untrustworthy company in the field of pharmaceuticals,
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:36.200]  is actually spreading HIV, I'm sorry, spreading avian flu, H5N1 in their H1N1 vaccinations
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:41.200]  to 18 European laboratories, and they say it's an accident.
[1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:47.200]  At the same time, you've got a train that somehow there's an accident in a laboratory.
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:50.200]  Biles blow up inside a box.
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:53.200]  I mean, it's ridiculous accidents that are happening.
[1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:54.200]  On a train.
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:59.200]  And remember, this is Baxter with Bayer knowingly shipping out the AIDS product.
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:00.200]  Right.
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:02.200]  I mean, this is incredible.
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:06.200]  It's unbelievable, and there's no mention of this on the mainstream.
[1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:11.200]  So we're really looking at absolutely with the new affidavit.
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:13.200]  With the affidavit, you've got the definitive proof.
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:19.200]  You've got all the links that show you that the Rockefeller Trust from the partnerships of New York City
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:24.200]  is intimately engaged in not only the deception through the mainstream media,
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:35.200]  but actually engaged in the vaccination and toxication and the dissemination of these hideously toxic vaccines.
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:41.200]  Now, I want to go back to something, and I want to get your take on it, and then Sherry's take on this.
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:46.200]  We have confirmed, this is up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:52.200]  and we're getting more and more of these every hour coming in from Texas and New York and Illinois,
[1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:58.200]  health care workers, school teachers, people that run daycares, daycare workers, police.
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:02.200]  They're being called in, they're told, you've got to take the regular flu shot,
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:06.200]  and many of them in the last two weeks have already been forced to do it through color of law.
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:07.200]  They're told it's a new regulation.
[1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:08.200]  The Fed said we have to.
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:10.200]  They don't show them any law.
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:16.200]  They say we're under level six, and they say, don't tell anyone we made you do this.
[1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:17.200]  I mean, how criminal is that?
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:22.200]  How obviously underhanded and stinking to high heaven is that?
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:24.200]  And we now have these documents.
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:27.200]  In fact, we'll go to infowars and punch up on screen.
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:32.200]  It's got the document posted, the article, home health care workers in New York required to get vaccinated.
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:34.200]  That's on the main page of infowars.
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:38.200]  You click on it, and here's the letter where they're told, you take this or you're fired.
[1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:45.200]  So Obama's saying you don't have to take it, but quietly they're testing to see if they can force the medical workers and police to do it,
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:50.200]  because if they can force them, then they can try to force the general public.
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:44:04.200]  Yeah, my greatest urging right now is for all the attorneys who have a heart for humanity to advance the temporary restraining orders based on the evidence that we have on the vaccine adjuvant.
[1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:17.200]  That alone, the toxicity of the science and the documentation, even congressional records, is enough to say, hey, courts and judges, please stop this right now.
[1:44:17.200 --> 1:44:31.200]  And I really am not seeing a lot of heroic attorneys come forward, and the ones that I believe are heroic, I just watched them stalling and stammering and debating whether or not they should do X, Y, Z.
[1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:34.200]  We're running out of time.
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:42.200]  Well, even if you're forward-taking all these poisons from Baxter and Bayer, who knowingly ship out HIV-filled factor rate, killing people en masse on record.
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:44.200]  I mean, we can pull up the MSNBC report.
[1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:46.200]  I mean, this is not us just saying this.
[1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:50.200]  I wouldn't dare come out and just say that about Bayer or Baxter if it wasn't in the news.
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:52.200]  I get emails saying I'm making it up.
[1:44:52.200 --> 1:45:00.200]  No, these companies admittedly do this, and then now we're going to trust their vaccine that the squalene alone the army admits they suspended the anthrax.
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:03.200]  Campaign because it was killing the troops.
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:04.200]  Right.
[1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:08.200]  And it's more concentrated in this according to the reports that I've been reading.
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:21.200]  And Alex, I also want to add that Baxter is in partnership with CSL, which is basically the Australian pharmaceutical company that is connected with Rupert Murdoch's research institute.
[1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:30.200]  That's Murdoch Children's Research Institute that is actually conducting swine flu trials on babies and children up to eight years old.
[1:45:30.200 --> 1:45:31.200]  And pregnant women.
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:32.200]  And pregnant women.
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:39.200]  And it's operating, it's actually being, the class action suit against Baxter and CSL right now.
[1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:48.200]  There's a hospital, a small hospital that is suing them because they are restricting the blood supply that the hospital has.
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:51.200]  And so what that means is all connected dots.
[1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:57.200]  I mean, well, these companies connect back to New York because I had the doctors involved who were in the prisons.
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:01.200]  I remember back in the late eighties, they banned prisoners giving blood.
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:08.200]  But in Arkansas, Clinton would ship it out to New York, then to Toronto and then to these companies filled with HIV.
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:11.200]  People they knew had AIDS and hepatitis were allowed to give.
[1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:14.200]  They do this because they're eugenicists.
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:15.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:20.200]  And again, I want to reinforce the American Red Double Cross.
[1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:25.200]  The American Red Cross was created by the Rockefeller Brothers.
[1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:32.200]  They first started the Blood Council of the City of New York that then gave rise to the American Red Cross.
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:37.200]  So what we're really witnessing when we give blood to these demons, we're really allowing them.
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:48.200]  They're using our blood to transmit disease so that their drug industrialists can make best fortunes off of humanity's suffering.
[1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:56.200]  This is just hard to deal with knowing the facts and seeing how diabolical this is.
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:05.200]  Dr. Horowitz, from studying how they've done things in the past, you predicted the anthrax attacks successfully with total precision and said we'd be through the mail because you saw their studies on it.
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:19.200]  Looking at other studies they've done with Dark Winter and other flu pandemic scenarios for martial law lockdowns, how do you and your crystal ball see them releasing something?
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:22.200]  What areas of the country, how would they do it?
[1:47:22.200 --> 1:47:28.200]  What should police that are waking up but are compartmentalized, what should they be on the lookout for?
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:41.200]  Well, I think Los Angeles is the highest likely place that a central intelligence agency because Rockefeller controls CIA and CIA is on top of all the infectious disease organizations.
[1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:46.200]  That's according to their own documentation. They see infectious disease as a national security risk.
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:59.200]  So CIA oversees NIAID, Dr. Fauci, he's a puppet of CIA. So we're looking at, if you read the book Death in the Air, Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare.
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:05.200]  Like I said yesterday on the show, I came out with the title long before September 11th.
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:10.200]  You think about Death in the Air, Globalism, Terrorism, Toxic Warfare.
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:22.200]  Very few people were talking about that back then and evergreen helicopters and the covert operations, the fronts for the CIA that are operating the aircraft.
[1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:31.200]  It could either be spraying, they could easily redo what they did in the New York subway systems and in the tunnels of Pennsylvania Turnpike.
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:41.200]  Years ago, CIA and United States Congress investigated CIA wrongdoing involved in spreading biological weapons over San Francisco.
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:42.200]  They could do the same thing.
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:46.200]  New York subway, deaths resulted, the tales remain classified, 1968.
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:54.200]  Right, exactly. So these are their capabilities. And again, I believe they're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:49:06.200]  And I believe that, you know, because we're all waking up and I believe that just like you shared with the pre-announcement that Building 7 was already coming down in Europe.
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:11.200]  That's again, Thomas Glosier runs Reuters, intimately connected to the drug industry.
[1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:14.200]  And it was Reuters. I want to just stop you. It was Reuters.
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:24.200]  At first, two BBC channels simultaneously reported the exact same text. Their news reporters reading off teleprompters said Solomon Brothers Building 7,
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:29.200]  47-story building is falling completely from fires into its own footprint.
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:32.200]  And then the firefighters are all standing there and then they hear the countdown.
[1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:35.200]  25 minutes later, they're told, get back. We're bringing it down.
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:38.200]  This is on CNN videos. They're running and then it blows up.
[1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:44.200]  And then BBC said, no, you don't have that video. No, we lost the video. No, it isn't real.
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:49.200]  Then they made a TV show on BBC last year admitting, okay, we just screwed up.
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:50:00.200]  And then the reporter admitted on the BBC News article they wrote, the editor of the BBC of BBC News admitted Reuters quote, screwed up.
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:09.200]  And an hour before gave us an internal news brief that Building 7 had fallen with how it actually fell.
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.200]  Okay, that's like saying somebody's going to have a heart attack in an hour who's walking along healthy.
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:15.200]  Police are going to come back to you and say, did you poison them?
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:21.200]  How did you know that Bob, who was 45 and in perfect health sitting at a park bench was going to die in an hour?
[1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:23.200]  They had a crystal ball, Alex.
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:26.200]  They had a real crystal ball and then it came out Reuters.
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:34.200]  I don't know if you knew this doctor, but you just brought it up, but we discovered Reuters was the one that sent that to BBC.
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:51.200]  Yeah, and look at also, before anybody knew anything about this H1N1, Reuters reported that it was a combination of avian swine and Spanish flu viruses that now they agree that the scientists agree.
[1:50:51.200 --> 1:50:56.200]  How did they know that that early on and how come they reported that?
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:50:57.200]  And then when you just...
[1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:25.200]  Turns out they had patents years before. Stay there.
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:29.200]  Blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:33.200]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:35.200]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:52:01.200]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:08.200]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-Eleven was an inside job.
[1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:11.200]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:18.200]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:27.200]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:52:27.200 --> 1:52:33.200]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:33.200 --> 1:52:40.200]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:44.200]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:44.200 --> 1:52:46.200]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:52.200]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:58.200]  The truth rises. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.

[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:42.200]  Then I'm going to cover the CPS coming out to people's kids for no reason.
[1:54:42.200 --> 1:54:45.200]  $15 million fines for garage sales.
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:51.200]  If you have any even 10-year-old recalled product having no idea what you're selling, that's all coming up.
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:58.200]  A bunch of global government economic news is coming up as well today.

[1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:41.200]  I did want to let you know about some of the sponsors that make this radio show possible briefly.
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:43.200]  One of them is E-Foods Direct.
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:49.200]  These insane economic and biological times and all the things that are happening, I believe in storeable foods.
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:56.200]  These last more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years guaranteed if it's in your garage like mine is, don't have room in my house.
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:59.200]  I've got a three-year supply for my entire family.
[1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:02.200]  And I bought other storeable foods, didn't like the quality or they were old.
[1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:07.200]  These are non-GMO, non-hybrid, freshly packed, everything but the bananas has grown right here in the U.S.
[1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:12.200]  This stuff is packed every month, biggest outfit out there, longest continually operating.

[1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:34.200]  Also, Diginet.net.
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:39.200]  I noticed we were sent a video of National Guard running an illegal checkpoint in Arizona with the police.
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:42.200]  Somebody shot on the Diginet.net pin.
[1:56:42.200 --> 1:56:47.200]  Very inexpensive, high quality, solid state, press one button, it records audio and video.
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:52.200]  They've got sunglasses that have a tiny camera and little chip in them that are awesome.
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:59.200]  In fact, we've got some of these. Don't let the guys forget not to take these to the G20 that's coming up because
[1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:01.200]  they've got 2,000 troops on the ground in Pittsburgh.
[1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:05.200]  I'm sending three guys up there, Burmese is going to and Douglas.
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:12.200]  Anyway, side issue, the point is Diginet.net, Diginet.net, have something that can be a record in court, anything.
[1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:18.200]  Great for journalists, great for people stopped by the police, Diginet.net, that's Diginet.net.
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:28.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, give them a call at 888-344-6681, 888-344-6681, Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net.
[1:57:28.200 --> 1:57:30.200]  We're about to go to break. That was a short segment.
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:37.200]  Come back in the next 30 minutes and take your phone calls for Dr. Leonard Horowitz and the investigative journalist
[1:57:37.200 --> 1:57:41.200]  he's collaborating with at fluscam.com, his website.
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:44.200]  And of course, we are going to continue with your calls.
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:51.200]  But when we come back, I do after this one minute break, 70 seconds if you want to be technical, with the station ID.
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:56.200]  I want to ask him about this Reuters article that I was just mentioning.
[1:57:56.200 --> 1:58:04.200]  I just had it in front of me, but I'll dig it out during the break where they are openly saying that all these people are going to die.
[1:58:04.200 --> 1:58:12.200]  They are openly saying that even though there's going to be all these deaths after you take the flu shot, it's not the flu shot.
[1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:14.200]  And it's Reuters saying this.
[1:58:14.200 --> 1:58:22.200]  This key group that Dr. Horowitz and Ms. Kane, Sherry Kane are saying are connected into all this intimately.
[1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:28.200]  So I'll get their take after this quick break when we come back in 70 seconds to start the third hour.
[1:58:28.200 --> 1:58:35.200]  They'll be with us for 30 minutes, toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9331 on the flu issue.
[1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:39.200]  Okay, that's what we're taking calls on right now. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:48.200]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:48.200 --> 1:58:54.200]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:58:54.200 --> 1:59:00.200]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:05.200]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:59:05.200 --> 1:59:10.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:12.200]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:19.200]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:26.200]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration,
[1:59:26.200 --> 1:59:30.200]  reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[1:59:30.200 --> 1:59:33.200]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[1:59:33.200 --> 1:59:38.200]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[1:59:48.200 --> 2:00:09.200]  That's acolablue.com.
[2:00:18.200 --> 2:00:25.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:25.200 --> 2:00:33.200]  Here is the Reuters article, and it says millions of people are going to die after taking the flu shot,
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:35.200]  but it's not the flu shot that's going to kill you.
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:39.200]  They're diagnosing everyone saying there's going to be no adverse reactions,
[2:00:39.200 --> 2:00:43.200]  even though they admit every vaccine, even those that push them have adverse reactions.
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:50.200]  And Dr. Horowitz, Sherry Kane, you were bringing up this director of Reuters, who's also a Bilderberg member,
[2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:56.200]  being a key operative in this and profiting from it and knowing, knowing,
[2:00:56.200 --> 2:01:02.200]  and the medical community is asking how did they know day one that it was swine, bird, and human all mixed with the H1N1.
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:04.200]  Dr. Horowitz and Sherry Kane.
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:13.200]  Well, Thomas Gloser, who is the CEO and director of Thompson Reuters, which is the world's largest international multimedia news agency,
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:20.200]  is also the director of Merck & Company, which is the leading pharmaceutical company in the world that manufactures,
[2:01:20.200 --> 2:01:22.200]  influence, and HPV vaccines.
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:27.200]  And he's also on the board of directors for partnership for New York City.
[2:01:27.200 --> 2:01:32.200]  Again, we go back to David Rockefeller's partnership for New York City,
[2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:45.200]  which, if you look at the people on that board, who are also in charge of rebuilding the World Trade Center in partnership with Jerry Silverstein Properties,
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:51.200]  Jerry Silverstein, who purchased the World Trade Center six weeks before it came down.
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:54.200]  We can look at all the people that are players in this.
[2:01:54.200 --> 2:02:04.200]  Rupert Murdoch, who has the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, who is partnered with CSL, which is the Australia's largest,
[2:02:04.200 --> 2:02:11.200]  Australia's leading biopharmaceutical company that produces the avion and H1N1 swine flu vaccination,
[2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:20.200]  and is now conducting swine flu trial, vaccination trials on children between six months and eight years old.
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:26.200]  They have recruited in Melbourne about 100 Victorian children aged between six months to eight,
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:33.200]  who were targeted for studying collaboration with the University of Melbourne and the federal government of Australia.
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:38.200]  The person that runs that is Sarah Murdoch, who is Rupert Murdoch's daughter-in-law.
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:45.200]  He is the chairman of the partnership of New York City, but here's something really interesting.
[2:02:45.200 --> 2:02:52.200]  Co-chairman for the partnership of New York City is a man named Lloyd Blankfein,
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:59.200]  who happened to be to co-op the overseer for Wilde Medical College of Cornell University,
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:05.200]  which had the very first well-publicized university outbreak of the swine flu.
[2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:07.200]  They've been using those as hype.
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:11.200]  We noticed three months ago they'd have military drills of locking down universities,
[2:03:11.200 --> 2:03:16.200]  and those universities are the ones where they hype it and claim there's been 2,000 cases.
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:18.200]  Right, so it's a RICO scam.
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:26.200]  It's an organized crime ring, and it's being run initially out of New York by David Rockefeller at all.
[2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:31.200]  And he's in the Encyclopedia Britannica, the founder of the Rockefeller family,
[2:03:31.200 --> 2:03:36.200]  and then his son, and now David, in all the literature, mainline Pulitzer Prize-winning books,
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:42.200]  book on it, it's always the Rockefellers. They created the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[2:03:42.200 --> 2:03:45.200]  Hitler thanked them in his speeches and in mind comp.
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:48.200]  I mean, these guys have set up the architecture of our planet.
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:51.200]  They're social Darwinistic eugenicists.
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:54.200]  Dr. Horowitz, can you speak to their mindset briefly?
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:57.200]  Well, the mindset obviously is either they're extraterrestrial,
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:02.200]  or they're absolutely demonically traumatized when they're young,
[2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:09.200]  and because when you study, as I have, and I've worked with the FBI's official methods and materials
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:15.200]  in diagnosing organized serial killers and apprehending them by understanding their mindset.
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:18.200]  And that's how you first got famous back in the 80s.
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:21.200]  Right, that's my area of primary expertise.
[2:04:21.200 --> 2:04:28.200]  Harvard investigator in regard to looking at medical sociology, psychopathology,
[2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:34.200]  and how we can try to change how we can actually develop beyond this trauma-based journey.
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:36.200]  Stay there. I want to talk more about that, because that's right.
[2:04:36.200 --> 2:04:41.200]  You were all over the news in the 80s exposing the doctors with the AIDS and killing people and all of that,
[2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:45.200]  and so that's your degree is in studying that type of special medical criminology.
[2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:48.200]  That's why you could predict the anthrax attacks with total precision.
[2:04:48.200 --> 2:04:50.200]  That's how you're able to predict all this.
[2:04:50.200 --> 2:04:56.200]  My God, Dr. Horowitz, what an asset you are, my friend, a true Maverick, a true Renaissance man,
[2:04:56.200 --> 2:05:00.200]  and you've got a great investigative journal is working with you as well, Sherry Kane.
[2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:31.200]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:34.200]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,
[2:05:34.200 --> 2:05:37.200]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:40.200]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:05:40.200 --> 2:05:43.200]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science,
[2:05:43.200 --> 2:05:47.200]  go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:05:47.200 --> 2:05:54.200]  That's mysolarbackup.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[2:05:54.200 --> 2:06:00.200]  877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:06:24.200 --> 2:06:28.200]  This book will work for anyone. Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:31.200]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy,
[2:06:31.200 --> 2:06:33.200]  and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[2:06:33.200 --> 2:06:37.200]  You know the government isn't looking out for you. You need to look out for yourself.
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:40.200]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:44.200]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:48.200]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[2:06:48.200 --> 2:06:51.200]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:56.200]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net. One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[2:07:21.200 --> 2:07:26.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:31.200]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:07:31.200 --> 2:07:35.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:35.200 --> 2:07:39.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:43.200]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:47.200]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:55.200]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:07:55.200 --> 2:08:23.200]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:32.200]  We're going to your phone calls here in just a moment, but the break interrupted Dr. Horowitz.
[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:36.200]  Dr. Horowitz, you're talking about this being a crime syndicate, a racketeering operation.
[2:08:36.200 --> 2:08:44.200]  All the evidence is there. You were finishing up with studying medical criminology,
[2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:46.200]  and then we're going to go to calls. Go ahead.
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:56.200]  Well, again, there's so much evidence that shows when a child is traumatized.
[2:08:56.200 --> 2:09:04.200]  The doctors are actually maturing and candidates licensed to kill the brainwashed mind control slaves by trauma.
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:11.200]  The whole medical education process reflects what takes place, has got to take place in serial killer's mind.
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:20.200]  Because what happens, the neurology gets crossed. What brings people, normal people, joy brings them anxiety.
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:25.200]  And what brings normal people fear and horror brings them joy.
[2:09:25.200 --> 2:09:29.200]  Instead of nurturing, they enjoy strapping a child down and ripping their teeth out with pliers.
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:35.200]  Yeah, they actually do. That's exactly how organized serial killers feel and think.
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:40.200]  And because of the trauma that they sustain when they're child, their children.
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:43.200]  Look at Stalin, look at Hitler, look at Mao.
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:47.200]  Yeah, and this is what's going on in these secret societies.
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:53.200]  Basically, you remember there was a reporter several years ago that was, I believe he was killed after going in,
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:58.200]  and George H.W. Bush was asked, you know, what about the skull and bones? And he laughed.
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:05.200]  Well, that reporter was actually videotaping them conducting mock killings.
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:12.200]  And so this is kind of what we're dealing with. We're not dealing with normal human beings.
[2:10:12.200 --> 2:10:17.200]  And this is what your number one risk in society is.
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:24.200]  As a behavioral science expert and a social, a medical sociologist, I can tell you that the number one risk
[2:10:24.200 --> 2:10:30.200]  that people have this concept that there can't possibly be people who are so evil.
[2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:39.200]  When, in fact, it is your love. It is the truth in your heart that really is inconceivable to you that people could do this.
[2:10:39.200 --> 2:10:45.200]  That's your blind spot. That's why women, you know, got in the yellow Volkswagen with Ted Bundy.
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:52.200]  Look at this evidence. Ecoscience alone, when he went before J. Rockefeller to be confirmed as the White House science are,
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:58.200]  and we have these clips in the upcoming film, J. Rockefeller worships him.
[2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:03.200]  They worship Zbigniew Brzezinski because he brags he helped kill 3 million in Cambodia funding that.
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:08.200]  That's their rock stars. To them, they want control so they can kill.
[2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:13.200]  Just like other tyrants, when they get control, suddenly start setting up death camps in every case.
[2:11:13.200 --> 2:11:21.200]  This is their beauty. Black uniforms, piles of dead bodies, tortures, screaming death, hellraiser, event horizon type stuff.
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:28.200]  This is what they're into and Ecoscience is admitting they want to kill at least 80% of us and they believe it's beautiful.
[2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:32.200]  And it's totally sick and they put their messages everywhere.
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:37.200]  I was telling people earlier, Dr. Horowitz, I was watching this morning on the treadmill I was jogging.
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:45.200]  I was watching Mark Wahlberg's film titled The Happening where the environment gets mad and the plants kill everybody
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:48.200]  by making them commit suicide with the chemical, the plants release.
[2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:54.200]  And as this guy is being run over by a lawn mower, he turns on the big lawn mower, the big riding mower, runs it over him.
[2:11:54.200 --> 2:11:59.200]  It cuts to a billboard that says, this is what you deserve.
[2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:04.200]  And it's all these movies and all these shows about everybody dying from a bio-release.
[2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:08.200]  They are getting everyone ready for this mass killing.
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:13.200]  Right. And again, to do that, you're not dealing with anything normal.
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:22.200]  It's either extraterrestrial or it's trauma-based human that's become an organized mass murderer.
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:26.200]  By extraterrestrial, you mean demonic?
[2:12:26.200 --> 2:12:33.200]  Yeah, again, because I have a spiritual orientation and basically it's talked about in the Bible.
[2:12:33.200 --> 2:12:38.200]  There's things called Nephilim, fallen angels who come into the daughters of men, change the genetics
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:42.200]  and that's why it rained for 40 days and 40 nights back in Noah's age.
[2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:45.200]  We're dealing with the genetic engineers of today.
[2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:50.200]  And my own orientation to this is that the Creator is not going to stand for it.
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:55.200]  There's nothing more powerful than the Creator in the universe and we who are working for the Creator,
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:58.200]  there's a lot more light than darkness and basically darkness.
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:02.200]  You know what's funny? The transhumanists that I covered in an in-game to a man, Kurzweil, all of them,
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:07.200]  say they're going to be gods, they're going to become creators, they're going to merge with machine
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:09.200]  and then they're going to kill the rest of us.
[2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:13.200]  That's what they're up to.
[2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:18.200]  I mean, even if this isn't real, I mean, even if they're just delusional, these people are crazy.
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:20.200]  They're out there. They're completely gone.
[2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:28.200]  And the sad thing is that the normal human being can't conceive of the devilishness of these people
[2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:32.200]  and what the risk is to them for not waking up.
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:33.200]  Sherry?
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:40.200]  I believe that these people are definitely worshiping Satan. If you even watched the film Eyes Wide Shut
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:46.200]  with one of Stanley Cooper's last film, it gives you an example of the kind of people they are.
[2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:51.200]  By the way, they killed him and cut 25 minutes out. I have that from sources in Hollywood.
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:52.200]  I believe that.
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:56.200]  But you know, I snuck into the real Eyes Wide Shut Bohemian Grove.
[2:13:56.200 --> 2:13:59.200]  Yeah, that's great. I applaud you.
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:06.200]  Amazing. I mean, I knew that something happened with him because he was really revealing all of his movies were about based on truth.
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:10.200]  Well, I mean, here's an example, Sherry, that I want you to comment on that.
[2:14:10.200 --> 2:14:14.200]  Dr. Eric Pionk, who made headlines three years ago, two and a half years ago, saying,
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:17.200]  I want a weaponized Ebola to be released, kill 90%.
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:20.200]  I'm ready for my family to die. I want to die.
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:22.200]  Rob Jacobson was at Whole Foods the other day.
[2:14:22.200 --> 2:14:30.200]  Carol saw him with the Somewhere in My Stack Newsweek, the case for killing Granny and how great it is to kill the old people.
[2:14:30.200 --> 2:14:34.200]  And he said, well, they want to kill you too.
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:39.200]  And she said, good, I need to die. Humans are bad, but going back to Pionka, you go to his UT website.
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:41.200]  I checked it again a month ago. It's still there.
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:43.200]  This is the official UT website.
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:50.200]  It's him dressed as a druid with a big beard and talking about how much he loves Lucifer on the UT website.
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:57.200]  And every time you research Maurice Strong or any of them, they are completely open worshipers of Lucifer.
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:14:58.200]  Go ahead.
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:04.200]  Well, I mean, the whole idea that Satanism is even much more mainstream than people realize.
[2:15:04.200 --> 2:15:09.200]  I mean, look at all the followers of Elron Hubbard, who was a well-known Satanist.
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:15.200]  This man was a following Aleister Crowley, and there were so many people involved in his group.
[2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:22.200]  So if you really research who's involved and all the people and players, they see it as not only,
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:28.200]  they don't see it as a religion, but more of a reason to do these killing.
[2:15:28.200 --> 2:15:36.200]  It's a group. It's a socialized, psychopathic organization.
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:41.200]  And the outcome is this indoctrination of the culture.
[2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:49.200]  We are an American medical culture that we've now been engineered, behaviorally, socially engineered to become.
[2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:51.200]  And this is the greatest challenge.
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:58.200]  You know, it is a complete fraud to say that the behavioral sciences is a soft science compared to, let's say,
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:01.200]  you know, mathematics or physics.
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:04.200]  Those are considered hard sciences.
[2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:13.200]  But the truth of the matter is the most powerful and the most well-studied and meticulously directed science of all
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:17.200]  is the mass mind control mainstream media's behavioral science.
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:19.200]  And the Pentagon says that. They admit it.
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:22.200]  They say 90% of warfare is psychological.
[2:16:22.200 --> 2:16:25.200]  The people will just become conscious of this. We can beat it.
[2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:28.200]  But if you won't wake up out of your trance, folks, there's no hope.
[2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:33.200]  Leah, son is in school, has a story about the flu shot. Go ahead.
[2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:37.200]  Yes, hi. So if I want to say thank you for waking up.
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:39.200]  We've been listening to you for about a year.
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:42.200]  And this is the first time I've called.
[2:16:42.200 --> 2:16:50.200]  My son came home on Friday from school saying that he was asked to escort a student to the front office who was ill.
[2:16:50.200 --> 2:16:59.200]  They placed a mask on the ill child's face and had my son escort him to the front office, to the clinic while waiting to go back to his classroom.
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:05.200]  Leah, this is a fear mongering indoctrination where they get everybody trained to freak out so the medical mafia can come in.
[2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:08.200]  So your son is escorting him. Go ahead.
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:16.200]  In the office, he's waiting for his, somebody walked into the class, nurse, say to the child,
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:19.200]  I'm going to give you a shot just in case it's the swine flu.
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:21.200]  He watched the nurse give a shot.
[2:17:21.200 --> 2:17:32.200]  He then watched the nurse on speakerphone call the boy's parents afterwards and informed the parent that she had given the child a shot and that they needed to come pick him up.
[2:17:32.200 --> 2:17:38.200]  And the mother was furious as far as my son said her reaction was, what? I'm coming to get my child.
[2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:39.200]  I went up to the school.
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:41.200]  What is the name of your school? This is huge.
[2:17:41.200 --> 2:17:46.200]  So without parent consent, your son saw them inject. What's the name of the school?
[2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:49.200]  The name of the school is Velvet Elementary School. It's an Orange County school.
[2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:53.200]  Okay, your phone's cutting out. Elementary in Orange County, Florida?
[2:17:53.200 --> 2:17:57.200]  Velvet Elementary School in Orange County, Florida.
[2:17:57.200 --> 2:18:02.200]  And we spoke to them this morning. We spoke to the principal. We had a meeting with the principal.
[2:18:02.200 --> 2:18:04.200]  The principal said she was going to look into it.
[2:18:04.200 --> 2:18:09.200]  My husband proceeded to leave. I stayed. I was going to go on a field trip today.
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:22.200]  The principal then called me and my son as well as the clinic nurse and his teacher, my son's teacher, into the office and intimidating sort of asked my son, did you see this?
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:31.200]  And my son said, yes, I did. The nurse proceeded to stand up, smack her hand on the table violently and call my son a liar.
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:37.200]  Completely upset. Spoke with another parent of a student in the same class. She had no idea that anyone was in the school.
[2:18:37.200 --> 2:18:40.200]  We've gotten no notice. Let me stop you. That's what they do.
[2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:45.200]  Obama says there's no shots, but we have the letters confirming from the nurses they're forcing them.
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:50.200]  My God, stay there, ma'am. Dr. Horowitz, we may have to keep you longer into the hour to take more of these calls.
[2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:53.200]  They're all lined up here with people here witnessing this.
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:56.200]  I mean, this looks like this is criminal, but this is true.
[2:18:56.200 --> 2:19:02.200]  It is criminal. It's absolute official criminal malfeasance beyond gross negligence.
[2:19:02.200 --> 2:19:08.200]  Gross negligence is where you basically, you know what to do, but you don't do it.
[2:19:08.200 --> 2:19:14.200]  This is where there's an actual agenda to inject and somebody's telling me...
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:19.200]  Hold on. How many hospitals have been caught when parents say no vaccines?
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:23.200]  They take the baby away and inject them. That's illegal. They just do whatever the hell they want.
[2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:27.200]  They think they're gods. They're a priesthood of control freak. Sorry, doctor. Go ahead.
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:34.200]  That's exactly right. And this is what I've been absolutely appalled at, people in public health and the officials in medicine.
[2:19:34.200 --> 2:19:41.200]  These are supposed to be my colleagues. These people are absolute mass murderers, and they've got to stop this.
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:47.200]  My God, and they know we're waking up to them, so they're trying to come in, scare us, set the precedent to forcibly inject.
[2:19:47.200 --> 2:19:50.200]  Stay there, Leah. Finish your story. Recap it when we get back.
[2:19:50.200 --> 2:19:59.200]  In Paul, Louisiana, a friend told to take a shot at work. Nate and Georgia, Anthony, Elijah, and others. Stay with us.
[2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:30.200]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[2:20:48.200 --> 2:20:57.200]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:00.200]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[2:21:00.200 --> 2:21:06.200]  There are many guarantees in this world. The closest I can come to a guarantee is that the dollar is going to zero.
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:14.200]  During the Great Hyperinflation in Weimar, Germany, people who had worked all their lives and vested conservatively were wiped out, reduced to poverty.
[2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:18.200]  There are many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S. today. I'll send you a list.
[2:21:18.200 --> 2:21:27.200]  There are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and silver, and legal and constitutional ways to avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable.
[2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:35.200]  I'm Bob Moss with Midas Resources. Many of the people I talk to today are aware of trouble coming, but haven't taken action to protect themselves.
[2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:40.200]  There is, in fact, a financial tsunami coming, and it could fall upon us quickly with little warning.
[2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:48.200]  Don't procrastinate, protect yourself. Call me today, Bob Moss, at 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[2:21:48.200 --> 2:22:01.200]  That's Bob Moss, Midas Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 111. Again, that's Bob Moss, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:10.200]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:16.200]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:27.200]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:22:27.200 --> 2:22:35.200]  Oh, the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:22:35.200 --> 2:22:39.200]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:42.200]  Builder Bird is making big progress toward a world government.
[2:22:42.200 --> 2:22:47.200]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their attitude.

[2:24:00.200 --> 2:24:12.200]  Okay, Leah, son in school, Zellwood Elementary, Orange County, Florida.
[2:24:12.200 --> 2:24:21.200]  So the nurse slams her hand down and says, you're a liar to your son. What about this other little boy? Was he there? I guess he was at home sick.
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:35.200]  No, actually, he had showed back up at school on Monday and told everyone that he had had swine flu. And I really just want to put this out there because we were very persistent today that we had told the principal, we only want verification that this did not happen.
[2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:44.200]  Allow us to speak to the other child's parents. We can have a meeting at the school. She refused to do that. My husband asked, he said, fine.
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:52.200]  Well, listen, find out the kid's name, call the parents out of the phone book, and then you've got a major lawsuit here of what you're saying is accurate.
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:25:01.200]  Now, this is, it's the same MO I've seen. It's the same pathology here because now they're trying to cover up what they did and you get those two families together.
[2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:11.200]  It's over for these people and we need to make examples out of them because I guarantee you this is, it's the same MO. They shoot up the nurses and then say, you're not to talk about this. Dr. Horowitz.
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:20.200]  We've got to make them the models for simply a cease and desist restraining orders.
[2:25:20.200 --> 2:25:34.200]  We've got to basically hold them accountable for this gross breach of faith and trust that we have in our school administrators who are simply following out a vaccination intoxication depopulation agenda.
[2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:38.200]  But doctor, are you not supposed to give a flu shot to somebody who's already got it?
[2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:46.200]  Yes, there are numerous contraindications. That's one of them. Also, there's 15% of the population approximately that have eczema.
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:54.200]  That's an autoimmune disease. It's an ailment that also indicates your immune system would be potentially overwhelmed by vaccinations.
[2:25:54.200 --> 2:26:03.200]  All of these risks are being completely neglected. The school administrators, as well as what's taking place in, like we talked about earlier,
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:11.200]  safely supermarket pharmacists, we interviewed the other day, had no clue what's even in the vaccinations that he's administering.
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:15.200]  And we asked him, would you take this vaccination yourself? And he said, of course not.
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:18.200]  Well, then I asked him to administer it.
[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:28.200]  Two years ago, I had the Prince George County, Maryland state attorney on. He was on CNN saying, the kids got to take the shots, images of police dog barking at kids,
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:33.200]  2,000 kids being shot up with their families, crying, saying, I don't want it, but I have to or I'm arrested.
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:38.200]  All color of law, they use truancy laws to do it, saying you'll be kicked out if you don't take the shots.
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:42.200]  Well, then we'll arrest you for that when they couldn't do it. And then I had him on.
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:47.200]  He said, yeah, I don't vaccinate my kids and started laughing at me. It's funny, isn't it, Dr. Horowitz?
[2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:55.200]  Oh, it's disgusting. Again, it's demonic, sinful spirit that takes over these people's minds.
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:27:03.200]  It is a spirit. More and more, I realize, just as a layman, not even coming at them, coming from a secular perspective, it's like a download.
[2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:10.200]  It's like a giggling demon. It's like funny and happy. And they love it and they laugh when they're stealing people's kids.
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:15.200]  And what is that? It's like they're all the same. Their eyes are the same.
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:25.200]  Yeah, it's a cult. It's a cult indoctrination. They have literally been brainwashed by the use of trauma into a certain track mentality.
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:34.200]  And it's a consciousness system. You know, like there's a cognitive, there's a little voice in the back of your head that sometimes you have to say, shut up.
[2:27:34.200 --> 2:27:40.200]  Well, yeah, I don't want to do that. These guys are ingrained and engaged in it and it has taken over them.
[2:27:40.200 --> 2:27:47.200]  They have no reasonable sense. They have no desire to look at the facts. They have no desire to even look at the science.
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:54.200]  They are simply following an agenda like any mind controlled Manchurian candidate would.
[2:27:54.200 --> 2:28:00.200]  That's it. I mean, more and more, I realize, and I read Pentagon documents, psych warfare documents that are declassified.
[2:28:00.200 --> 2:28:05.200]  They say they're putting the public into a state. They say a lower alpha state.
[2:28:05.200 --> 2:28:10.200]  They say that they don't want the public to snap out of it. The general public is hypnotized.
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:19.200]  Once they're hypnotized, they can put in the programming and we're literally dealing with people that have been turned into nothing but biological androids.
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:26.200]  Right. And then when you really consider this in the theological sense, if you look at the book of Revelation, for example, it says,
[2:28:26.200 --> 2:28:35.200]  those who fornicated with the devil in the end times and deceived the wealthiest men of all the nations. That's, of course, the Rockefeller et al. group,
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:41.200]  because to deceive the wealthiest men of all the nations, you've got to be mega wealthy. They practice sorcery.
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:45.200]  Look up the root word in concordance of sorcery. It's pharmacopeia.
[2:28:45.200 --> 2:28:53.200]  These are the pharmaceutical industrialists that then cast magic spells, says the Bible. Magic spells? What is that?
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:29:00.200]  A hypnosis machine. Television. Pharmacheia. Pharmacheia. That's why the symbol of medicine is the double snakes.
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:10.200]  Exactly. So this is, we're dealing with the end time scenario here. And these are the demons. We've just now, the affidavit exposes them royally.
[2:29:10.200 --> 2:29:15.200]  We now know who they are. We now know how they're operating and we can't trust them.
[2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:24.200]  Now we've got to simply continue to wake up our beloved friends and neighbors and relatives to say, hey, if I love you and you love me,
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:31.200]  we've got a problem here. Let's do something about it. And we've got to get these attorneys to literally issue their restraining laws,
[2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:35.200]  not only on these administrators, but also on the health officials.
[2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:51.200]  We got a break. We're going to race through five calls on the other side. Your call straight ahead.
[2:29:51.200 --> 2:30:00.200]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:00.200 --> 2:30:07.200]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:07.200 --> 2:30:15.200]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:15.200 --> 2:30:21.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:21.200 --> 2:30:23.200]  Now, what are you going to do about it?

[2:33:08.200 --> 2:33:17.200]  Final segment with Dr. Lynn Horowitz and investigative journalist Sherry Cain going to go to your phone calls right now for people that have been patiently holding.
[2:33:17.200 --> 2:33:23.200]  Leah, stay in contact with us with what's happening with your son at that school and trying to nail down if that happened or not.
[2:33:23.200 --> 2:33:29.200]  Let's talk to Paul in Louisiana. You're on the air. Go ahead, Paul.
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:36.200]  Yes, sir. Alex, I'd like to thank you and your family and let you know we pray for you and yours as you do that job.
[2:33:36.200 --> 2:33:43.200]  I appreciate that. A friend of mine's a nurse and they gave him the option to take the flu shot, but they didn't threaten their jobs.
[2:33:43.200 --> 2:33:48.200]  They just told him, you'd have to wear a mask, you know, for the next, what, six months or so?
[2:33:48.200 --> 2:33:49.200]  A yellow star.
[2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:54.200]  She answered him and said, I'll just do the Michael Jackson impression. So she opted out.
[2:33:54.200 --> 2:34:06.200]  So the rest of them didn't seem concerned. The doctor didn't seem concerned. And later, she came down with some symptoms, I guess, flu-like, which a lot of symptoms are. So he starts treating her for the flu.
[2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:09.200]  Now, automatically, nothing. No questions. Just start treating her.
[2:34:09.200 --> 2:34:15.200]  Yeah, we see a lot of that, Dr. Horowitz, where people don't even have the flu, but they put out false reports that they do.
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:29.200]  The other thing is that the treatment, if you think about the abuse of antibiotics and how antibiotics toxicity and the concept of us constantly creating new microbes from overuse of antibiotics,
[2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:34.200]  even for viral infections, they're prescribing antibiotics, which is they should be prescribing antivirals.
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:45.200]  And then the antivirals, like the Tamiflu, totally toxic. You know, again, this is why I urge people to consider the silver hydrosols, especially oxysilver.com.
[2:34:45.200 --> 2:34:49.200]  Absolutely. Thank you. Paul, good to hear from you.
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:52.200]  Nate and Georgia has questions for our guests. Go ahead, Nate.
[2:34:52.200 --> 2:34:54.200]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex? It's been a while.
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:34:56.200]  God bless you. What's on your mind?
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:06.200]  Well, I just wanted to talk about the swine flu. I have two stories I wanted to tell you. A couple weeks ago, my fiancee's little sister, she went to school in Roswell, Georgia,
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:16.200]  has called us in Tenio. And when she went to school, when she went to go see the school nurse, they told her that she had to take the swine flu shot.
[2:35:16.200 --> 2:35:21.200]  And if she didn't take the shot, the teachers would be arrested and charged with a misdemean.
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:31.200]  Well, the nurse kind of knew how to get out of taking the shot, had her sign of waiver saying that she was a Jehovah's Witness and she couldn't take the shot.
[2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:33.200]  So that's how she got out of taking the shot.
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:39.200]  And then another story, I was at Publix, which is a store down here in Georgia.
[2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:48.200]  I was here in Publix. I was walking through the store. One of the coworkers, all of the grocery stores, give the swine flu shot now and the regular flu shot.
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:57.200]  So this guy just went and got the swine flu shot in the Publix store. Well, two hours after he had the shot, it was like a stroke-like symptom.
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:04.200]  He left his head on the counter, literally split his head open in two, fell on the floor, was all bleeding and shaking in convulsions as if he was having a stroke.
[2:36:04.200 --> 2:36:10.200]  They called the police and the people around him were like, what happened to him?
[2:36:10.200 --> 2:36:16.200]  They said, well, the only thing that happened was he took the swine flu shot a couple of hours ago and then he went into convulsions.
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:22.200]  And I'm just amazed that the people sitting around him didn't put two or two together and realized that the swine flu shot...
[2:36:22.200 --> 2:36:32.200]  Well, that's because Reuters has told everybody you're not allowed to say it's connected to that, even though every other vaccine always causes things like this to happen.
[2:36:32.200 --> 2:36:42.200]  And who is the director of Reuters? Thomas Gloster. And Thomas Gloster is also the director of the Merck.
[2:36:42.200 --> 2:36:53.200]  Which is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, mostly responsible for what we're looking at, HIV-Aid today by the transmission through the hepatitis B vaccine,
[2:36:53.200 --> 2:36:57.200]  given between 1972 and 74.
[2:36:57.200 --> 2:36:58.200]  Unbelievable.
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:05.200]  I mean, you're amazed and you're stuck and there's no exit because everywhere you turn, there's another connection to all of these people.
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:08.200]  They're all in collaboration with each other.
[2:37:08.200 --> 2:37:13.200]  And they're hunting us. They're literally doing what psychopaths do. Thank you so much, Nate.
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:17.200]  Anthony in New York, flu questions for the guests. Go ahead.
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:19.200]  Okay, hello?
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:21.200]  Hear me?
[2:37:21.200 --> 2:37:22.200]  Yes, go ahead.
[2:37:22.200 --> 2:37:23.200]  Go ahead.
[2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:34.200]  Alex Jones, I deeply respect and I'm grateful for your show. I've been listening to it for a couple of years now and Dr. Horowitz, you're one of my heroes.
[2:37:34.200 --> 2:37:40.200]  I'm greatly informed by all the research you've been doing.
[2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:50.200]  And I don't know, I'm in a predicament that you are also in, Dr. Horowitz, which is I have a school child here, mine in a school in New York.
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:57.200]  And I have started to read your affidavit, but I haven't forwarded it to any FBI yet.
[2:37:57.200 --> 2:38:04.200]  And that's one issue and then the other issue is what is a parent supposed to do? Well, what am I supposed to do?
[2:38:04.200 --> 2:38:14.200]  Keep my kid out of school because they might be using not only the vaccinations over there, but they might be administering a...
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:21.200]  Children are the most precious thing in our lives. The teachers themselves aren't bad, but the system is bad.
[2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:24.200]  I don't think anybody should have their children in public school. I'm not making a moral judgment here.
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:31.200]  I'm just saying my children are homeschooled. They don't get anywhere near a government-controlled facility.
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:39.200]  Well, I applaud that. You know, again, maybe I'm too nice a dad for my own children because, you know, I've been pressured by them.
[2:38:39.200 --> 2:38:45.200]  The one that I have right now, as a matter of fact, we're preparing this evening to go to Laguna Beach School Board meeting
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:55.200]  and then tomorrow to the Parents' Teachers Association. Parents need to know right now that all the PTAs are gearing up by direction of virtually FEMA
[2:38:55.200 --> 2:39:03.200]  to direct the emergency response, which they're predicting and this whole vaccination agenda will be conducted partially
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:07.200]  or administered partially by volunteer parents from the PTA.
[2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:15.200]  So, number one, there's two things that I would recommend. Not only read and study the affidavit in all these links
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:24.200]  so that you can articulate very, very clearly and reasonably calmly to the health officials as well as the school board persons.
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:31.200]  That this is an issue that has not been addressed by the health department and these vaccinations are risky.
[2:39:31.200 --> 2:39:35.200]  And these are companies that have histories of killing people knowingly over and over again.
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:43.200]  Right. And then the other thing is take the resolution on fluscam.com. Copy and paste the resolution.
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:49.200]  There's the actual Hawaii, the new Hawaii resolution has gone through the attorneys from the county of Hawaii.
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:55.200]  They're currently this coming week debating it on the floor of the legislature.
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:40:02.200]  So, you have all that information. Copy and paste it and make your own county council and township.
[2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:05.200]  Now, tell people what the resolution says briefly.
[2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:12.200]  The resolution states that because of all of these issues that we're talking about that there will shall be a religious exemption
[2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:18.200]  and philosophical exemption administered to anyone who wants to exempt from the vaccine program
[2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:23.200]  and that children shall not be injected without their parents consent.
[2:40:23.200 --> 2:40:28.200]  All right. Thank you so much, Coller. A few final calls for our guests.
[2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:34.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alicia in California. Go ahead.
[2:40:34.200 --> 2:40:41.200]  Hi, Alex Jones. I'm a big fan and my dad is a big fan of you.
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:45.200]  It's just a great honor to be on a talk show.
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:48.200]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you. What's on your mind?
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:57.200]  We've been doing some research about how they're talking about mandatory fine flu shots behind doors.
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:04.200]  We just need our schools is leaning on the fine flu.
[2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:09.200]  They can take you out of school if you don't do fine flu and stuff.
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:12.200]  Yeah, they're saying if you don't take the shot, we're going to kick you out.
[2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:14.200]  Yeah, I heard that.
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:19.200]  But they said you will have some disabilities on your grades and stuff.
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:27.200]  Here's what you do. You download Alan Phillips' book on vaccination exemptions.
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:32.200]  Read it. It's only about 120 pages. It's big writing and it's easy to read
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:39.200]  and he'll share with you the state's laws as well as the number one urging you
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:41.200]  to assert your religious exemption.
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:43.200]  Yeah, this is all being done through color of law.
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:47.200]  Obama's saying you don't have to take it, but then they're pushing it and threatening to fire people.
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:49.200]  God bless you. Good to hear from you.
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:54.200]  I want to talk to Marcus and Georgia, a vaccine worker, then Charlene and New York Medical Worker.
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:41:58.200]  We're going to let our guests go. We'll be back later this week graciously.
[2:41:58.200 --> 2:42:00.200]  Marcus and Georgia, you're on the air.
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:02.200]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:03.200]  Good, sir.
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:09.200]  Yes, I work for Novartis. We're the number two flu-making vaccine company in the world.
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:18.200]  Yeah, you guys just brought up Novartis, which was one of the CDC's organizations that advanced the Mexican flu fright.
[2:42:18.200 --> 2:42:22.200]  That's right. And part of what the adjuvants and everything that you mentioned.
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:27.200]  Yes, they are in there and I read news articles in which they mentioned that it's not in there.
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:29.200]  They're lying.
[2:42:29.200 --> 2:42:34.200]  I know it's admittedly on the insert, admitted on their own website.
[2:42:34.200 --> 2:42:40.200]  The news is, see, even if you believe all there's, that it's good, how do you believe people who are always lying?
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:43.200]  I'm sorry, sir. I'm going to shut up because you're a key person, Marcus.
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:50.200]  Tell us as a vaccine worker what's going on.
[2:42:50.200 --> 2:42:58.200]  We have, they're rolling out with a new one that's supposed to be a one dose vaccine.
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:07.200]  And what they said that the two shot vaccine no longer will be required and they're going to offer it to the employees and also to the family of the employees beginning.
[2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:12.200]  They ate October, October 21st. I actually believe it is the actual date.
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:17.200]  What do you do for the vaccine company?
[2:43:17.200 --> 2:43:23.200]  Well, I work for the daughter company and I get all the information due to the internet part.
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:28.200]  The daily, I have all the information and what are the workers saying?
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:31.200]  What are the workers saying around you?
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:38.200]  Well, the younger people, they, I'll say maybe in their mid 30s and below, they're not with it.
[2:43:38.200 --> 2:43:51.200]  They don't want to take it, but a lot of the older employees, I think just due to the overwhelming media hype, they fear for it and they're going to, a lot of them going to go ahead and take it.
[2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:58.200]  A lot of them and some are doing their research and they're going to think about it.
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:08.200]  We had meetings on it this past weekend in which they went down a full outline on the way that they're going to prescribe it to the employees.
[2:44:08.200 --> 2:44:10.200]  They haven't made a mandatory yet.
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:12.200]  Are they discussing making it mandatory?
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:16.200]  It's a discussion. It's a discussion that's taking place.
[2:44:16.200 --> 2:44:31.200]  What they're doing is gauging whether they can make you take it. The federal government, we just confirmed this, it's up on presentplanet.com in my stack, sent out questionnaires, the CEOs and corporate leaders asking, will you follow orders for quarantines forced inoculations?
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:33.200]  That's right.
[2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:51.200]  The new one that they came out with, that the FDA just approved, I think it's called CELTORA, the MLB Denied Adjuvant CELT based culturet one. They have it ready and I think that's going to be one of the ones they're going to have available for the employees.
[2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:52.200]  Sir, what are you?
[2:44:52.200 --> 2:44:55.200]  They said that was not available to the population yet.
[2:44:55.200 --> 2:45:05.200]  Oh, yeah, they get a test wire on people.
[2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:29.200]  This was his opinion. He said they're going to have one that was going to turn the immune system off and the second one will be the one in which they will be arrived.
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:43.200]  Every single one of the vaccinations, we've got the package inserts now posted freely downloadable on flu scam.com and you can see even the manufacturers are telling you all the warnings about it.
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:50.200]  But then meanwhile Reuters is saying there's no problem and there's no adjuvants, there's no mercury, all lies.
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:57.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, so what are the employees saying? As you know this stuff's in there, but the media is saying it's not in there.
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:08.200]  You know what? When we interviewed the other day in Safeway supermarket, we interviewed all the employees and no one was going to take the vaccination.
[2:46:08.200 --> 2:46:13.200]  The pharmacist, like I said, had no clue whatsoever and he wasn't going to take it.
[2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:21.200]  Yeah, they're just finding, but in closing, Marcus, what's the bottom line with people you're talking to? I mean, are your coworkers smelling a rat?
[2:46:21.200 --> 2:46:32.200]  Yes, they are and I printed off the insert for one of them, the fluverine and on a warning and precaution, it does mention the Guillain-Barre syndrome.
[2:46:32.200 --> 2:46:46.200]  And it says on answer if Guillain-Barre syndrome has occurred within six weeks of receipt of prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give a fluverine should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits.
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:52.200]  Yeah, we need to get that up on infowars.com. Do you have the fluverine posted up on FluScam, Dr. Horowitz?
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:46:58.200]  Yes, we do, Alex. Just connect to fluscam.com and you'll see the new page that's there.
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:07.200]  I want to get Paul Watson to do a headline. Flu vaccine maker admits link to Guillain-Barre, which killed your mother, Dr. Horowitz, sorry to mention that.
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:14.200]  It's painful. We can save lives here, but again, then we need to show how they're hoaxing saying it doesn't.
[2:47:14.200 --> 2:47:20.200]  And I hear that Dr. Dina Dell every weekend on the radio saying that's not true and that the insert says it.
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:28.200]  Yeah, but you know what? The insert itself is a fraud because you can't simply say at six weeks it's a cutoff.
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:41.200]  If you've ever had Guillain-Barre, it means that you have your system engaged with antigenic complexes and immune system sensitivities that are going to be aggravated hideously by these new injections.
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:46.200]  This is unbelievable. God bless you, Marcus. Stay in contact with us. Anything else?
[2:47:46.200 --> 2:47:54.200]  I've got one more point that you mentioned about the microchip. With me working for Novartis, I also had access to another story that was linked on their website.
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:48:01.200]  Microchip and blood pressure pills. Nags. Patients who get the medication. So they do have the microchip ready.
[2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:07.200]  No, they're saying they're going to make people, they're considering making you take a chip to prove you've had the flu shot.
[2:48:07.200 --> 2:48:14.200]  That's mainstream news. I mean, we're entering the twilight zone. Thank you, Marcus. Final caller and then we've got other key flu and economic news coming up after the break.
[2:48:14.200 --> 2:48:20.200]  And then Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us as well. Charlene, New York medical worker, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:31.200]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex. I was just, I've been trying to call for a while now and I just wanted to really, as a person who's experienced great health most of my life.
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:46.200]  I swam every day, played ten or four hours at a time and was in perfect health, worked in the medical field and had a chance to unknowingly receive the hepatitis B immunization, the trifecta.
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:59.200]  After receiving the third shot, I moved to a different work site. So three months or three weeks later, excuse me, I was noticing some very photosensitivity.
[2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:09.200]  I was waking up in the morning in my head. It was really weird. It looked like a corpse. It looked like there was no blood. It wasn't like pretty and pale.
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:20.200]  It was like a corpse head. But I still had never heard of any kind of bad reactions to things knowing I was in the most excellent health you could be in.
[2:49:20.200 --> 2:49:33.200]  Anyways, just to make a long story short, I want to let people know out there that the neurological storms that came upon me shortly after that are, it's like being stuck in a Stephen King novel and I'm not kidding.
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:37.200]  Well, they admit it causes the brain to swell. Dr. Horowitz.
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:52.200]  You know, the hepatitis B vaccine, just look at the documents in the affidavit on the hepatitis B vaccine. Give it to 12-hour-old infants whose immune systems aren't mature yet is absolute genocide.
[2:49:52.200 --> 2:50:00.200]  And we wonder why the kids are all dull and half retarded now. It's soft kill weapons. Ma'am, call me back again with more. We're out of time.
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:08.200]  Charlene, because tomorrow we're going to open the phones up again for victims and other people. God bless you. And I'm sorry that happened to you.
[2:50:08.200 --> 2:50:18.200]  That's why I want to warn people. We know. We know. And they just keep killing us. The Gardasil, they keep killing us. They're dying. They're becoming paralyzed.
[2:50:18.200 --> 2:50:37.200]  Dr. Horowitz and his investigative journalist friend, Ms. Kane, back up this week. In fact, as I put you on hold, Dr. Horowitz, with my producers, let's set a time up for you to come back on the next three days with the latest updates as this develops.
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:45.200]  This is a war room here as we try to warn everybody. Dr. Horowitz, Sherry Kane, thank you so much for your incredible courage.
[2:50:45.200 --> 2:50:53.200]  Thanks a lot, Alex. Thank you, Alex. Stay there. We're going to set you up again. And we've got a bunch of other medical doctors coming up. We've got Sherry Timpinney. We've got Dr. Blalock.

Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.

Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more.

[2:54:04.200 --> 2:54:13.200]  Don't worry, this show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:54:34.200 --> 2:54:39.200]  We're going to continue in the last half hour to take your whistleblower calls about forced inoculations, troop movements.
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:46.200]  I have a video clip of troops running checkpoints in Arizona against citizens. It's all starting to happen as they just ratchet it up incrementally.
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:56.200]  Here's a Reuters headline. Gold climbs towards 18-month high, eyes on fed, and gold is at $1,019 in climbing.
[2:54:56.200 --> 2:55:07.200]  We have Ted Anderson joining us because Ted Anderson bought gold again when it was a lot lower than it is now and he can sell you gold and silver at a price much lower than it is right now.
[2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:13.200]  You can't beat that in this market when most people can't even get their hands on gold and silver now. A lot of the brokers are running out.
[2:55:13.200 --> 2:55:16.200]  Ted Anderson, Midas Resources, thanks for joining us.
[2:55:16.200 --> 2:55:28.200]  Thanks for having me up, Alex. Boy, I can tell you, it's getting tough to buy it in the dips right now. I had about maybe an hour and a half to two hours to lock things in when gold was at $995 here just yesterday,
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:33.200]  and now it's jumped right up to $1,020, and it's getting tough.
[2:55:33.200 --> 2:55:42.200]  I mean, India right now is buying gold like crazy. The Chinese are. There is a lot of demand in this marketplace, not just here in the United States, but in the world.
[2:55:42.200 --> 2:55:52.200]  And mostly you'll see that reflected in the prices when the Asian markets open up while we're sleeping. Every now and then we have this dip here because the feds in to try to push the prices down.
[2:55:52.200 --> 2:55:59.200]  And then you watch the European market and the Asian markets and the price just runs right back up.
[2:55:59.200 --> 2:56:10.200]  Well, this is like being able to buy Google or IBM stock when it's at $100, and then it goes up to $130 or $150, and you're still selling the stock for the lower price.
[2:56:10.200 --> 2:56:20.200]  People cannot beat this deal. Ted, gold's more than doubled in the last five years. It's over 20% gain a year. What is it?
[2:56:20.200 --> 2:56:28.200]  Yeah, it's running right in at that 20% level because you got to remember, we go back down to about $245 gold, and yeah, gold has really done well.
[2:56:28.200 --> 2:56:29.200]  So it's over.
[2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:36.200]  Well, wait, wait, if it was $245 then, and now it's up to over $1,000, that's more than a doubling. That's a tripling quadrupling.
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:42.200]  Yeah, quadrupling from the lowest point in the marketplace. You know, it's hard to hit those points.
[2:56:42.200 --> 2:56:49.200]  And like I said, I mean, to be able to buy in these dips right now when you only have little tiny opportunities, usually have a day or two.
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:55.200]  I don't even get that anymore. It's like an hour, it'll come down and boom, it's right back up again and it's strong.
[2:56:55.200 --> 2:57:02.200]  I expect to see gold go up further. It's breaking forward. If you're a technician, you can see what's going on in the marketplace.
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:06.200]  It's hitting this resistance level and heading right back on up again.
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:12.200]  It looks like a W on a chart, which is what, you know, it's an indication that we're going to break forward.
[2:57:12.200 --> 2:57:17.200]  You know, Bob Chapman was mentioning that on a show. I was on with them just yesterday.
[2:57:17.200 --> 2:57:24.200]  And I've been following the same thing. If you follow Robert Proctor and you're a technician at all, you can see what's going on.
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:28.200]  Well, Ted, tell people the gold and silver you've got at the below market price.
[2:57:28.200 --> 2:57:35.200]  Well, the best things that I have right now still are the walking Liberty haves at 869 silver trading around 17 bucks.
[2:57:35.200 --> 2:57:39.200]  That's a steal. That's like buying walking Liberty haves at the junk price.
[2:57:39.200 --> 2:57:47.200]  And then the 10 dollar Liberty right now at 81850, roughly about $150 more if I buy them back in the marketplace right now.
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:53.200]  And seriously, I mean, if you're looking at the Franks or the British sovereigns, they're at a good buy too.
[2:57:53.200 --> 2:57:56.200]  But those two coins without a question hands down.
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:58:00.200]  Well, where is crazy Eddie when you need him? I should be yelling and screaming and saying incredible deal.
[2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:06.200]  It is such an amazing deal. We're just going to calmly let you know that price is there. Tell folks about the silver.
[2:58:06.200 --> 2:58:11.200]  Yeah, the silver right now, the best thing to buy is that walking Liberty half. It's 869.
[2:58:11.200 --> 2:58:15.200]  If you like those Lakota coins, they're going to be jumping up to there at 2230.
[2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:20.200]  You can call us at 1-800-686-2237. We'll have all that for you.
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:24.200]  But mention you heard it on the Alex Jones show, please.
[2:58:24.200 --> 2:58:30.200]  800-686-2237. If you don't tell them you heard it on this radio show today, Ted is selling gold at a higher price.
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:33.200]  This is special for our listeners only.
[2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:36.200]  800-686-2237.
[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:38.200]  Dr. Jerome Kors is coming up in five minutes.
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:42.200]  I want to talk to you more about the market, Ted. Stay with us back in one minute.
[2:58:42.200 --> 2:58:50.200]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:50.200 --> 2:58:54.200]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:58:54.200 --> 2:58:58.200]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:58:58.200 --> 2:59:02.200]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:59:02.200 --> 2:59:07.200]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:13.200]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:16.200]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:59:16.200 --> 2:59:21.200]  Run some pumps, short-wave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:28.200]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:59:28.200 --> 2:59:30.200]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:59:30.200 --> 2:59:38.200]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:59:38.200 --> 2:59:51.200]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[3:00:09.200 --> 3:00:15.200]  Ted Anderson is our guest for the next five minutes in Dr. Jerome Corsi on a host of important issues.
[3:00:15.200 --> 3:00:21.200]  The economy. Got a doctorate in that. His take on the flu. I don't know his view on it. We'll get it.
[3:00:21.200 --> 3:00:25.200]  I would imagine it's similar to ours from the research.
[3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:31.200]  And what's happening with Google and others wanting to track everything you do inside your home, that is coming up.
[3:00:31.200 --> 3:00:37.200]  In fact, as you guys print me that article of Watson's story three years ago about Google wanting to use the cameras and microphone
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:42.200]  on your computer to watch and track you, we can't find that. Get Watson to...
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:48.200]  I know you gave it to us. I got the stack here on the tracking in the home. I just need that one.
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:52.200]  Going back to Ted Anderson, Ted, you've been in the gold and silver business for 30 years.
[3:00:52.200 --> 3:00:57.200]  You've had minus resources for 12.
[3:00:57.200 --> 3:01:01.200]  I mean, we knew in the fall gold would go up. We told everybody that. I mean, that's what the smart money was on.
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:07.200]  The dollars plunging, the world is talking about all the overprinting of money and issuance of currency and credit to the central banks.
[3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:11.200]  They're telling us we're going to have the first jobless recovery, a booming economy where you're homeless.
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:16.200]  Because the banks are doing well. That's the only gauge in the economy now. Thanks to their heist, they're doing well.
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:20.200]  A $23.7 trillion in the U.S. alone of taxpayer money, the last 11 months.
[3:01:20.200 --> 3:01:25.200]  We haven't gotten new numbers. So it's just really the first 10 months. It'll be higher.
[3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:27.200]  What is really going on, Ted?
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:31.200]  What's really going on at this particular time is you said it like you did.
[3:01:31.200 --> 3:01:37.200]  We're in the time of the year where gold and silver does better as a historical fact.
[3:01:37.200 --> 3:01:40.200]  And right now we're at the beginning of it and not the end of it.
[3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:48.200]  We've just about reached the gold peak. That's the highest price that's ever been seen, which is $1,030.80.
[3:01:48.200 --> 3:01:52.200]  When we break through that level, gold is going to see a new trading range.
[3:01:52.200 --> 3:01:58.200]  We'll probably be seeing that 1,016 level and then we'll be bouncing down when maybe we'll get lucky
[3:01:58.200 --> 3:02:02.200]  and we'll be able to buy gold at about 1,050 on the dip.
[3:02:02.200 --> 3:02:06.200]  And so this momentum is building. You can see it in the charts and graphs.
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:12.200]  With India, every time, this time of year, they're always buying gold. This is their wedding season.
[3:02:12.200 --> 3:02:16.200]  It's part of the dowry to have gold for the women when they get married.
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:23.200]  In the springtime, they always sell to buy their seed for their farms. It's just timing-wise in the marketplace.
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:29.200]  But you compound this issue with all the money that's been printed by the Fed and issued into the banks
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:35.200]  and now you're seeing the velocity that money hit in the economy. That's why you're seeing gold go up.
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:42.200]  Right now, the Chinese are looking closer at a gold-backed basket-type currency to hold in reserve
[3:02:42.200 --> 3:02:48.200]  than they are the U.S. dollar and they hold $3.3 trillion of U.S. government assets,
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:55.200]  meaning the U.S. Treasury bonds, notes, and bills, and cash. All that money comes back to the United States.
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:03:00.200]  We're toast. We're going to be in worse shape than Argentina was when they failed.
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:08.200]  The United States has been on a credit binge and still is. Every time the government turns around and has a problem,
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:13.200]  they want to print money, which means that the United States has to borrow money directly from the Fed
[3:03:13.200 --> 3:03:17.200]  through the open market operation, and that means more money coming into the system,
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:21.200]  and it means a loss of purchasing power, and gold prices are reflecting that,
[3:03:21.200 --> 3:03:26.200]  and you can see the Fed trying to step in and manipulate the market and bring the price down.
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:32.200]  If you want to know more about that, all you have to do is go to gata.org, G-A-T-A.org,
[3:03:32.200 --> 3:03:36.200]  and you can find out more on that. I can just tell you right now, Alex,
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:43.200]  there's so much manipulation going on in the marketplace, but the Fed and its operations are losing the battle,
[3:03:43.200 --> 3:03:49.200]  and the value of the currency is going to be lost in the math of it,
[3:03:49.200 --> 3:03:54.200]  and unfortunately, the people of the United States are going to lose a lot of purchasing power,
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:59.200]  whether it's in the stocks, bond market, you're sitting in annuities, it doesn't matter what you're holding.
[3:03:59.200 --> 3:04:03.200]  What's going to happen is, as the yuppies that laugh at us finally, and it's starting to happen,
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:07.200]  start buying gold and silver as it goes up, that's going to make it even harder to get.
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:11.200]  You've now come to the point where it's hard for you to get it, you've got it in stock, silver and gold,
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:16.200]  way below what it's currently selling for. How long can you hold that deal you made in the last segment?
[3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:20.200]  Well, this one here, I'm going to hold until midnight, and if I'm lucky, if I'm really lucky,
[3:04:20.200 --> 3:04:25.200]  we'll get another dip, and I can buy again and still keep the prices low, but it's getting to be more difficult.
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:31.200]  Like I said, Alex, I had about a two-hour window here to pick up things at that $9.94.
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:36.200]  And you're selling it in the market right now at that one, gold's above $1,020.
[3:04:36.200 --> 3:04:42.200]  800-686-2237. The brokers will be there until midnight, central standard time tonight.
[3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:49.200]  Don't wait. The deal ends at midnight tonight, 800-686-2237.
[3:04:49.200 --> 3:04:54.200]  Midas Resources, the owner of the GCN Radio Network, the best deal out there, Ted Anderson,
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:04:59.200]  800-686-2237. Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get that, or you'll pay more.
[3:04:59.200 --> 3:05:01.200]  We'll be right back.
[3:05:30.200 --> 3:05:33.200]  Will you go to the Gathering Center and be immunized?
[3:05:33.200 --> 3:05:36.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:05:36.200 --> 3:05:40.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:05:40.200 --> 3:05:44.200]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[3:05:44.200 --> 3:05:48.200]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[3:07:58.200 --> 3:08:00.200]  You will never use anything else again.
[3:08:02.200 --> 3:08:09.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.200 --> 3:08:12.200]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:12.200 --> 3:08:17.200]  That's right, coming to you by Corporate Occupied Territory, the global corporate takeover
[3:08:17.200 --> 3:08:21.200]  of the United States, the entire planet, owns the new allotter, is moving quickly.
[3:08:21.200 --> 3:08:23.200]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to break down all these mainstream articles
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:26.200]  calling for a world government, world taxes.
[3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:29.200]  Meanwhile, the George Soros publications are saying we're liars.
[3:08:29.200 --> 3:08:32.200]  None of this exists using a military tactic of stalling,
[3:08:32.200 --> 3:08:36.200]  so we just argue about whether or not it exists rather than whether we want it or not.
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:41.200]  Dr. Jerome Corsi received a PhD from Harvard University in political science in 1972
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:45.200]  and has written many best-selling books, including the number one New York Times bestseller,
[3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:48.200]  New Fit for Command, Swift Boat, Veterans Speak Out Against Kerry.
[3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:51.200]  His latest bestseller was the late Great USA that we sell by the way,
[3:08:51.200 --> 3:08:55.200]  the latest edition at infoawards.com, the coming merger of Mexico, Canada.
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:08:57.200]  He's a senior staff reporter for WorldNet Daily.
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:09:01.200]  He's also written for human events and other big publications.
[3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:03.200]  His newest book is America for Sale.
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:05.200]  We'll have him back on in the next few weeks about that.
[3:09:05.200 --> 3:09:07.200]  Dr. Corsi, I got a host of issues.
[3:09:07.200 --> 3:09:13.200]  The flu, Google and the smart thermostats, California putting in another system that tracks Texas putting them in.
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:15.200]  We have one here at the office.
[3:09:15.200 --> 3:09:19.200]  It can tell what we're using, what we're doing, total surveillance.
[3:09:19.200 --> 3:09:22.200]  But I wanted to throw this out at you while I have you.
[3:09:22.200 --> 3:09:28.200]  I consulted on a new film, Camp FEMA, that just came out that we have at infoawards.com, and I'm in it.
[3:09:28.200 --> 3:09:34.200]  It has the FEMA documents, the legislation, the emergency management plans, the continuity of government,
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:38.200]  the whole system, and Glenn Beck, who I know you've been on the Fox News shows,
[3:09:38.200 --> 3:09:44.200]  and here to bash, and he's a big leader in the patriot movement and exposing a lot of things that are important like the government health care.
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:49.200]  But he's had popular mechanics on to say that the FEMA camps is all made up,
[3:09:49.200 --> 3:09:55.200]  and he used a strong man of a debunk thing from the mid-90s to say none of this exists,
[3:09:55.200 --> 3:09:58.200]  but you've written a bunch of articles about the FEMA camps.
[3:09:58.200 --> 3:10:00.200]  So is the New York Times for that matter and the Houston Chronicle.
[3:10:00.200 --> 3:10:06.200]  Give us quickly your take on the FEMA camps, and maybe I could send this video that I worked on to him,
[3:10:06.200 --> 3:10:09.200]  and maybe then he'll change his tune.
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:11.200]  Well, I don't have the article in front of me right now.
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:20.200]  I have documented contracts from the Department of Homeland Security to build a temporary detention camp.
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:25.200]  These have been in effect since the Bush administration.
[3:10:25.200 --> 3:10:33.200]  I continue to be concerned that under the idea of protecting us in natural disasters like Katrina,
[3:10:33.200 --> 3:10:38.200]  the government is gaining powers which could be used in the event of civil disorder.
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:47.200]  I lived through the 1970s. I did a lot of reporting, even when I was working for research institutes and academics.
[3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:56.200]  Going back to the 1970s about the detention camps that were used in protests like the May Day protests in Washington, D.C.
[3:10:56.200 --> 3:11:06.200]  I did a lot of research on Captain Zander that was head of the Washington, D.C. police force.
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:10.200]  So there's been a lot of history in the United States, and it's not all been good,
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:16.200]  of utilizing detention camps going back to the Japanese detention camps in World War II.
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:22.200]  I think any attempt to just poo-poo the effort, for instance,
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:27.200]  I reported on the National Homeland Security Directive, the president Bush signed,
[3:11:27.200 --> 3:11:34.200]  PDD 51, which gave him authority to declare that the office of the president was in charge of all levels of government,
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:41.200]  down to tribal government, and the declaration, the self-declaration by the president of a national emergency,
[3:11:41.200 --> 3:11:47.200]  very broadly defined, which could include, again, not just natural disasters or health disasters,
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:52.200]  but it could include a variety of civil protest situations.
[3:11:52.200 --> 3:11:56.200]  And now they're using the Army to spy on in-the-fed protests. That's been declassified.
[3:11:56.200 --> 3:12:01.200]  Now the Army wants 379,000 troops in America.
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:10.200]  Well, I've also reported extensively on U.S. Northcom and its mission to be a military presence in civil emergency situations.
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:18.200]  And these things are always very difficult. They're presented as if this is the United States government trying to assist the citizens.
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:28.200]  And there can be legitimate but limited roles for the federal government and even the military to play in natural hazards or other national emergencies.
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:34.200]  But what about the Arcadia drill in Iowa this year for gun confiscation?
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:47.200]  These are very fine lines, and they very easily cross over into violations of civil liberties on disrespect for the fundamental aggressive rights of protests that we have under the First Amendment.
[3:12:47.200 --> 3:12:51.200]  So I'm always very concerned about these, Alex, and the powers exist.
[3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:58.200]  There are presidential directives which could be used to exert martial law.
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:03.200]  There are powers to create temporary camps which could be used to create detention camps.
[3:13:03.200 --> 3:13:19.200]  I think it's important and responsible for people like yourself, for us at WorldNet Daily, to keep reporting of these issues so the American people are aware of a potential expansion of government power that would be completely antagonistic to the First Amendment.
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:27.200]  Well, sir, just so you know, from Texas to Arizona to Michigan to California, regular Army, regular Marines and National Guard.
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:33.200]  In Tennessee, three months ago, we had the state rep on the Army was running checkpoints with Homeland Security in Tennessee.
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:35.200]  The governor said, don't do it, and the Army ignored them.
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:45.200]  I'm playing a YouTube video sent to us from just a few days ago of National Guard troops in the middle of Arizona out searching people's cars.
[3:13:45.200 --> 3:13:47.200]  And I want to see this new film you created.
[3:13:47.200 --> 3:13:48.200]  I haven't seen this one.
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:53.200]  I've seen most of your previous film, and I enjoyed them, and I think they're well done.
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:55.200]  I want to see this new one.
[3:13:55.200 --> 3:14:00.200]  Well, I want to get into some other subjects with you, like the big report you've got at WorldNet Daily today.
[3:14:00.200 --> 3:14:03.200]  Also, Christian Science Monitor coming soon.
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:09.200]  Google your electricity use, tracking everything going on in your home.
[3:14:09.200 --> 3:14:11.200]  Also, your article, Get Ready.
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:12.200]  Here come the Energy Police.
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:16.200]  Google Power Meter could mean regulation of your private home.
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:18.200]  And we're going to go over these.
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:34.200] .org has partnered with E-P-B-J-E-A, Reliance Energy, SDGE, Semper Energy, Toronto Hydro, TXU, White River, Electric Cooperative, WPS, Wisconsin, Yellow Storm.
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:37.200]  It goes on and on, Eitron.
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:43.200]  And then I have the other articles here out of California where they're making people take these.
[3:14:43.200 --> 3:14:48.200]  And they came and put it on our business a few months ago here in Austin on our company.
[3:14:48.200 --> 3:14:49.200]  They didn't even ask.
[3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:52.200]  They just put it in, and they admit it tracks everything we're doing.
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:56.200]  Well, again, what this is is what's called a Google Power Meter.
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:15:03.200]  And it's an internet-based technology that measures your use of energy.
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:09.200]  And of course, Google, all these things come presenting themselves as a great favor to you.
[3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:15.200]  Google says, well, when you go to the grocery store, you get an itemized list of the groceries you bought.
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:27.200]  Why should you just get an energy bill at the end of the month for the energy company without itemizing your use of power by specific refrigerator, air conditioning, heater, et cetera?
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:28.200]  And they mentioned carbon tax.
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:30.200]  This is getting us ready for carbon audits.
[3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:42.200]  I know this sounds great, but what happens on this, Alex, is it sets up the basis for the government then to have standards where they say, oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, you're using too much energy.
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:56.200]  And when you combine it, as I have with the census reporting that's being planned, including the census survey that's going to be taken on a sample of the American people, where the government's going to know exactly who's in your home,
[3:15:56.200 --> 3:16:07.200]  what education they've got, what languages they speak, what nationality they are, how much money they make, et cetera, it's very conceivable that this energy meter then becomes the energy police.
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:14.200]  And Google provides the government with the data to say, oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, of course, your home is too big.
[3:16:14.200 --> 3:16:23.200]  You know, you've got to pay surcharge because you've got these additional rooms, unless you, of course, you want to maybe move in a poor family and house them.
[3:16:23.200 --> 3:16:30.200]  And by the way, your refrigerator's a little bit old, and we don't think you had proper insulation in your home.
[3:16:30.200 --> 3:16:33.200]  And they say if you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:42.200]  They're admitting this is part of the new climate change bill with these home inspections where the feds can evict you any time they want if you don't, quote, comply with federal international zoning.
[3:16:42.200 --> 3:16:59.200]  And what they're saying is that ET meets IT. In other words, energy technology meeting, internet technology, information technology, and it's being beta tested by Google, not just in the United States, but in India, Germany, Canada.
[3:16:59.200 --> 3:17:22.200]  Google intends this to be a global standard, so we've got more one-world order of vision here, saying that our energy use, our carbon emission footprint, all of these things can be measured, controlled, regulated by the government with new standards that are fundamentally anti-free enterprise.
[3:17:22.200 --> 3:17:30.200]  But right now, if you use energy and you pay for it, you have a right to buy the energy being sold to you by the utility.
[3:17:30.200 --> 3:17:37.200]  And again, they brag. Enron came up with this idea more than 12 years ago. They brag just like with artificial scarcity with water or diamonds or oil.
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:45.200]  They will restrict it, make you cut back on what you're using, and then just charge you more for less. It's a total scam.
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:58.200]  Well, and again, people have got to be aware of the power of the government in these situations. Look at the farmers out in Southern California, where the government is cutting off their water to protect some environmental creature that they don't want to go extinct.
[3:17:58.200 --> 3:18:11.200]  But this also sets the precedent, as you write in your article, that Google is hooked into your house. It's got algorithms that can tell when you're using the washing machine, the toaster. They admit this. They're now going to be itemizing what you're doing.
[3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:23.200]  This is the equivalent of cameras in the house. They can tell when you're using your television, when you're using your washer and dryer, when you're using your dishwasher, when you're using your air conditioner.
[3:18:23.200 --> 3:18:36.200]  They can measure whether or not this meets. So it's a complete monitoring if you're an energy waster or like in Austin, they charge you more if you use a lot of water. They're going to penalize you. They're surveilling you. This is big brother.
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:54.200]  This is a monitoring of what goes on inside your home. Your daily activities measured in terms of energy with a government regulation that could either say, you're violating some law, how you're using energy, or you're going to have a surcharge placed on you.
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:19:10.200]  Or under these new public welfare definitions that have, for instance, allowed expanded powers and eminent domain, the government either going to move a family in with you or they're going to restrict your ability to use the entire house the way you want to use it.
[3:19:10.200 --> 3:19:25.200]  And this is all stated. This is not our opinion. It's like they deny death panels, but then Newsweek comes out and says the case for killing Granny. And that's a psych warfare tactic, as you know, Dr. Corsi, where they announce they're going to do it and then deny they're doing it.
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:33.200]  Or Obama has a surrogate say, any criticism of him as racism, then he comes out and says, oh, that's not true. He plays the part of the good cop.
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:41.200]  Well, and just like the government regulates efficiency standards on cars and trucks, they're aiming to do it in your home.
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:55.200]  Well, of course, Tivo washes what you watch and creates a psychological algorithm and profile. And Google announced three years ago, government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[3:19:55.200 --> 3:19:58.200]  Google's already doing that. I mean, this is big brother.
[3:19:58.200 --> 3:19:59.200]  Exactly.
[3:19:59.200 --> 3:20:02.200]  Stay there. Stay there. Stay there, Dr.
[3:20:02.200 --> 3:20:11.200]  That search engine spy on you spy on me. Yeah, don't you know, Google, Yahoo and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database. You should use start page instead.
[3:20:11.200 --> 3:20:12.200]  Start page.
[3:20:12.200 --> 3:20:23.200]  Yeah, start page.com, the new name for Xquik, the world's most private search engine. They don't record your searches or your IP address and the search results are great. Plus, start page is third party certified and it's totally free.
[3:20:23.200 --> 3:20:28.200]  I don't want big brother watching what I do on the Internet. I'm adding start page to my browser.

[3:21:01.200 --> 3:21:23.200]  Good day. Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, September 22, 2009. Gold opened this morning at 1,016.10. A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for 1,044.58, 522.29 for a half ounce or 261.15 for the quarter ounce. That's 1,044.58, 522.29 and 261.15.
[3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:41.200]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources with an exciting announcement. Friday, September 25, at 7 p.m., two of the most influential representatives in Congress, Ron Paul and Michelle Bachman, are putting on a student town hall meeting free to the public at Northrop Auditorium University Campus.
[3:21:41.200 --> 3:22:01.200]  The topics of this rare event will be monetary reform, limited government and free market economy. Don't miss this powerful gathering. Again, dates for this event is Friday, September 25, at 7 p.m., Northrop U of M campus, or go to www.MidasResources.com for more information.
[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:11.200]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-Eleven was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:22:11.200 --> 3:22:19.200]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR?
[3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:33.200]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:38.200]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:22:38.200 --> 3:22:44.200]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:22:44.200 --> 3:22:52.200]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[3:22:52.200 --> 3:22:58.200]  Truth Rises. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:22:58.200 --> 3:23:25.200]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:23:28.200 --> 3:23:38.200]  We'll be back with a full list of all the stuff you need to know about the R-Charger in the battery without additives.
[3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:47.200]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity. Renaissance Charger offers a full line of products made in the USA for all types and sizes of batteries.

[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:09.200]  The U.N. Braggs, these big corporations braggs, they're going to charge you more for water, energy, everything.
[3:24:09.200 --> 3:24:13.200]  They're creating mega monopolies, duopolies, oligopolies.
[3:24:13.200 --> 3:24:20.200]  This is widespread. It's not just Google, but they're the big global player as you write in WorldNet Daily.
[3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:32.200]  Christian Science Monitor is saying how great it is. They're just doing this, and they explain that this computer system through the electrical grid is going to be tracking everything you do.
[3:24:32.200 --> 3:24:39.200]  I mean, this is a total violation of the Fourth Amendment, a total Trojan horse of Big Brother Panopticon.
[3:24:39.200 --> 3:24:56.200]  It's a home invasion by the federal government, ultimately, and state governments, if they want to participate, into your home with Google providing the technology for the government to measure all your activities based on how much energy you're using and what type of energy you're using.
[3:24:56.200 --> 3:25:14.200]  Down to, is your television on? Is your stereo on? Is your computer on? Are you using your dishwasher? How much air conditioning or heat are you using? And then, Alex, it sets up a standard where the government can either impose surcharges, oh, you're using too much energy.
[3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:24.200]  Your carbon footprint is too large. Or to say that there's something defective in your home. And why do you live in such a big home? How about if we move a poor family in?
[3:25:24.200 --> 3:25:33.200]  Maybe you need to close down part of that home. We don't think your refrigerator's old enough. Why don't you buy a new one? I mean, these are the kinds of intrusion.
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:35.200]  Well, that's the idea with the cash for clunkers.
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:54.200]  Yes. Well, the whole aim of government saying, well, we just want to provide you the information to be more efficient is a trojan horse because it looks like the government's there to help you. But once you let the government in the front door, you've let the government measure and monitor your home activity.
[3:25:54.200 --> 3:26:06.200]  And if your home is your castle, this is a invasion, a Fourth Amendment invasion into what people have as their most sacred part of their life, namely the privacy in their home.
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:19.200]  And this is being done by stealth. I mean, 5 million homes in California having it put in, 20,000 families are having cameras put in their homes to watch their kids. They're now saying they may make it standard for all new parents to have cameras watching them in the home.
[3:26:19.200 --> 3:26:21.200]  I mean, this is worse than 1984.
[3:26:21.200 --> 3:26:35.200]  Well, Alex, the fundamental freedom in terms of not only the government imposition on our lives, monitoring, measuring, controlling, having a bureaucrat make a decision about what you do, whether it's right or wrong.
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:52.200]  All of that's got to be offensive. Any American cares about fundamental freedom for the Fourth Amendment invasion coming into your home with electronics where the government can measure and impose taxes on you for energy use or demand that you use your home in a particular way.
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:56.200]  It's completely antithetical to the free enterprise system.
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:27:00.200]  Well, doc, you you reach millions of people on your radio interviews and your column.
[3:27:00.200 --> 3:27:12.200]  Did you know that we did this off of Google press release three years ago that they bragged they're already testing using the camera and the microphone built in if you have Google and you're using it to dial in.
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:15.200]  I'll have to research that further. I did not know that.
[3:27:15.200 --> 3:27:31.200]  Well, let's dial in with AI and they say, don't worry, a human isn't listening. A computer listens for keywords and they save a dog barks. Then Google ads pop up for a dog headline government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[3:27:31.200 --> 3:27:42.200]  And they have a link to in the story from three years ago. We have a link to Google admitting this. In fact, this is just one of Paul's articles.
[3:27:42.200 --> 3:27:51.200]  Well, this, I think is one of the key issues of the technology being utilized by the government to control and invade our lives.
[3:27:51.200 --> 3:28:00.200]  The idea of the free enterprise should be if you want to buy energy and pay for it, it should be up to you what you want to use it for.
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:15.200]  We're getting these definitions of the general welfare, general welfare clause, the Constitution, which is similar to the way that the Supreme Court's already expanded eminent domain to confiscate your private property.
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:21.200]  The pretext of the common good demand that your home be taken from you.
[3:28:21.200 --> 3:28:43.200]  So these are the kinds of concerns that I have when we allow these powerful technologies that Google's developing, this energy meter to be placed in our home, ultimately, whether we like it or not, as a condition of our receiving electricity that could ultimately be used to tax us or limit our freedom to how we live our lives within our home.
[3:28:43.200 --> 3:28:50.200]  Is there any way to stop this? I mean, obviously educating people, but how do you say no? I mean, they just came and plopped one on the building here.
[3:28:50.200 --> 3:29:10.200]  Well, I think the first issue is to fight it by letting people know that it's there, and then I think we've got to start demanding there be some legal action here, because unless they've got a search warrant, what is Google doing in baiting your business or your home to monitor or measure your energy consumption against your will?
[3:29:10.200 --> 3:29:17.200]  Well, it's like poisoning a well. They just put it into the technology like the iPhones, and then we're all just surveilled.
[3:29:17.200 --> 3:29:35.200]  And we've got to be aware of this and start fighting it. I think the article I wrote in my red alert newsletter here, the energy police, is really the issue because the Google power meter regulating your private home by government, which ultimately is the beginning of a police state.
[3:29:35.200 --> 3:29:41.200]  It is. Dr. Corsi, thank you so much for joining us. The new book, Just Out, America for Sale.

[3:29:51.200 --> 3:29:59.200]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:59.200 --> 3:30:15.200]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:23.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it?

[3:31:11.200 --> 3:31:15.800]  people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow
[3:31:15.800 --> 3:31:19.860]  man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time frame to
[3:31:19.860 --> 3:31:22.860]  fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[3:32:02.080 --> 3:32:05.920]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder
[3:32:05.920 --> 3:32:10.040]  would have made a difference in your life? In the past, owning a hidden video recorder
[3:32:10.040 --> 3:32:16.040]  has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry. That was then. This is now. Introducing

[3:33:26.160 --> 3:33:37.040]  it will hurt you bad. There is a murderer, a killer on the road. I think this song says
[3:33:37.040 --> 3:33:56.400]  it all. Crank it up. Let your children play. If you give this man a ride, sweet memory
[3:33:56.400 --> 3:34:03.400]  will die. I've cleared the phone lines. Specifically, if you're a nurse, military person, police
[3:34:03.400 --> 3:34:08.760]  officer, medical worker, with inside info on the force inoculations, we've confirmed
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:14.160]  with hospital letters, government letters. They're up on infowars.com, prisonpunna.com.
[3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:19.120]  I want to hear your whistleblowing or what's happening at your public school, private school,
[3:34:19.120 --> 3:34:25.320]  whatever intel you've got specifically on the flu. Those calls only, please. You have
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:35.720]  folks a chance to get in. 800-259-9231-800-259-9231. Here's that number. You're driving along
[3:34:35.720 --> 3:34:45.200]  in a squad car. You're a nurse. You're a military person. You've got key info. 1-800-259-9231.
[3:34:45.200 --> 3:34:50.680]  I wanted to get into violating Posse Commentatus National Guard on the streets of Kingman,
[3:34:50.680 --> 3:34:56.840]  Arizona, and we are going to do that in just a moment. Play that video for viewers. The
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:35:01.320]  audio for radio listeners as I break it down. Great job to the folks that shot this. You
[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:07.120]  just carry a little digital pen, hit the one button on the top, have it in your compartment.
[3:35:07.120 --> 3:35:11.680]  You see military checkpoint. They're all over the place now. I've run into these in Austin
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:17.160]  years ago. They do them illegally. We had a Marine Corps retired officer who ran a computer
[3:35:17.160 --> 3:35:23.200]  company in Austin, a listener. He was driving down I-35, had an illegal Army checkpoint.
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:27.800]  That made him go public to me about secret Army raids in the late 80s. That's in my
[3:35:27.800 --> 3:35:32.320]  film Road to Terrany. This stuff's intensifying, though, and they're acclimating the police,
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:38.920]  the military, the citizenry to go along with this, and it's very, very, very serious. So
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:41.280]  that is coming up here in just a few minutes. I wanted to tell you about a couple of the
[3:35:41.280 --> 3:35:46.280]  sponsors that made this hours possible. One of them is MySolarBackup.com. A lot of things
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:51.800]  can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms, or the government regulating
[3:35:51.800 --> 3:35:57.400]  how much power you can have. Enron shutting off power on purpose to then jack up prizes.
[3:35:57.400 --> 3:36:02.840]  All those examples we were just covering, you need to go to MySolarBackup.com from our
[3:36:02.840 --> 3:36:06.800]  great sponsor Solutions from Science. You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists
[3:36:06.800 --> 3:36:11.600]  of the power source 800 watt generator and a high efficiency solar panel designed to
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:15.680]  provide endless electricity. Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but the blackout
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:20.320]  gas pumps can't pump gas because they run in electricity. Everybody should just move
[3:36:20.320 --> 3:36:24.160]  towards getting self-sufficient. That's what the globalists hate. They want to control
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:28.120]  you. Go to MySolarBackup.com and check out this great starter unit. Great way to get
[3:36:28.120 --> 3:36:39.840]  into solar, 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or one word, www.MySolarBackup.com. Also, another
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:45.360]  great sponsor we have is Silver Lungs. This is a colloidal silver, a great colloidal silver.
[3:36:45.360 --> 3:36:51.240]  It's on our radar in its own right that then aerosolizes it where you inhale it. We've
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:55.240]  had a lot of, well, just check out the medical information they have there in the testimonials
[3:36:55.240 --> 3:37:04.800]  and reports at silverlungs.com. That's S-I-L-V-E-R lungs. SilverLungs.com, super high quality
[3:37:04.800 --> 3:37:11.560]  colloidal silver, has never been this easy and effective. It is just very, very effective.
[3:37:11.560 --> 3:37:15.120]  Silver Lungs has pioneered this nanotechnology one step further, but providing the most
[3:37:15.120 --> 3:37:21.520]  superior delivery method directly in the bloodstream through the lungs, silverlungs.com,
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:27.880]  ladies and gentlemen. Okay, thanks to those sponsors too for making the show possible.
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:34.120]  I now want to get into this martial law video and then we're going to talk to Alan, New
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:40.120]  York nurse at church, told to take vaccine in just a few minutes. Whistleblowers, people
[3:37:40.120 --> 3:37:44.080]  whose children have been threatened, told to take it. Any type of forced inoculation
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:47.920]  or intimidation or having it pushed on you, we want to hear about it. We confirm from
[3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:53.520]  listeners with all these documents. We call the numbers states, the feds, medical companies,
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:37:58.800]  big conglomerates, ordering people to take it or they're fired. Absolutely insane. So
[3:37:58.800 --> 3:38:02.440]  we've confirmed that. That's important to prove the government's lying and quietly
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:09.880]  doing this and telling people not to talk about it. But let's now go to this video violating
[3:38:09.880 --> 3:38:15.120]  posicom and taught us a national guard on the streets of Kingman, Arizona, Kingman,
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:24.400]  Arizona, Friday, the 18th of September at around 445 p.m. downtown on Andy divine national
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:29.960]  guard performing police duty, providing security and directing traffic. And again, the skin
[3:38:29.960 --> 3:38:38.760]  activity, New York, other areas, the mayor say, Oh, we want troops in Alabama, Birmingham
[3:38:38.760 --> 3:38:43.640]  is talking about wanting troops on the streets. They're just just announcing it to you. What
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:47.200]  is it the feds have been preparing for decades for? Why have they been gearing this up? We
[3:38:47.200 --> 3:38:51.720]  told you years ago, banking fraud, stealing everything through Fiat fraud, the Federal
[3:38:51.720 --> 3:38:57.560]  Reserve has carried out the crime. Now they've got to suppress us for bringing them to justice.
[3:38:57.560 --> 3:39:00.760]  So as we support our soldiers and troops, we cannot support the unlawful deployment
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:05.000]  of our soldiers on us soil to police the citizens, a clear violation of the posicom and taught
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:12.080]  us that. But yeah, they're not our troops anymore. And here is the unamerican precedent
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:18.640]  violating the law in the police state in Kingman, Arizona. Last week, here it is. Play the
[3:39:18.640 --> 3:39:26.640]  video Kingman, Arizona, Friday, 18, 2009 around 445 p.m. National Guard performing police
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:31.360]  duty. Again, they restate, they support the troops. Why don't we have to always say that
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:51.880]  like we're bad, like we're an enemy army. Here they are driving regular there. This is
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:40:15.680]  off a video pin. So they just saw troops and got their little camera. And why are they
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:39.360]  driving so fast?
[3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:41.360]  Have you ever done anything like this before?
[3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:43.360]  A fair or a National Guard?
[3:40:43.360 --> 3:40:45.360]  I've tried to change it.
[3:40:45.360 --> 3:40:47.360]  This is not for seeing it.
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:49.360]  You're a very nice human environment.
[3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:51.360]  There's a bunch of commentators, though.
[3:40:51.360 --> 3:40:54.360]  A National Guard shouldn't be here unless there is an emergency.
[3:40:54.360 --> 3:40:56.360]  Anyway, thank you. I wanted to answer that.
[3:40:56.360 --> 3:40:59.360]  Not against you, but it's not a good thing
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:01.360]  what's happening in this country when the military
[3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:03.360]  is teaming up with local police.
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:05.360]  We're not liking this at all.
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:07.360]  No, nothing with you.
[3:41:07.360 --> 3:41:09.360]  Nothing with you. Thank you.
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:11.360]  We're not liking this at all.
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:15.360]  Back at the scene of the crime an hour later,
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:17.360]  there were more troops.
[3:41:17.360 --> 3:41:19.360]  I'm so drunk.
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:21.360]  I hope so.
[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:23.360]  I don't think so.
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:25.360]  I don't think so, Brian.
[3:41:25.360 --> 3:41:27.360]  This is so criminal.
[3:41:27.360 --> 3:41:29.360]  It's a whole part of acclimation.
[3:41:29.360 --> 3:41:31.360]  They've set up a checkpoint.
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:33.360]  They've got roadblocks.
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:35.360]  Acclimating over here.
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:37.360]  Acclimating everyone for the total takeover.
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:39.360]  They'll just do it year after year
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:41.360]  until you totally accept it.
[3:41:41.360 --> 3:41:43.360]  They're going to be coming in your homes.
[3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:45.360]  $15 million fines for selling any recall toys
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:47.360]  or products in a garage sale.
[3:41:47.360 --> 3:41:49.360]  Here come the troops over to them.
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:51.360]  Let me see.
[3:41:55.360 --> 3:41:57.360]  Hello there.
[3:41:57.360 --> 3:41:59.360]  The National Guard isn't here.
[3:41:59.360 --> 3:42:01.360]  Yeah, they just left.
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:03.360]  What are they doing here?
[3:42:03.360 --> 3:42:05.360]  They're doing security service.
[3:42:05.360 --> 3:42:07.360]  They're security service.
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:09.360]  All right, that's enough.
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:11.360]  That's enough.
[3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:13.360]  You can watch the rest at infowars.com
[3:42:13.360 --> 3:42:15.360]  from the Mojave Minutemen.
[3:42:15.360 --> 3:42:17.360]  I want to get the Mojave Minutemen on.
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:19.360]  We have Tom in Arizona saying he's a witness
[3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:21.360]  at National Guard.
[3:42:21.360 --> 3:42:23.360]  We're going to Alex in Florida.
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:25.360]  Children in school told to take shots.
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:27.360]  Alan in New York Nurse told to take vaccine.
[3:42:27.360 --> 3:42:29.360]  This is unbelievable.
[3:42:29.360 --> 3:42:31.360]  Tom in Arizona, did you see this
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:33.360]  when I lived in Kingman, Arizona?
[3:42:33.360 --> 3:42:35.360]  And they were there on Friday.
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:37.360]  And they were eyeballing me as I drove by.
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:39.360]  It was very uncomfortable.
[3:42:39.360 --> 3:42:41.360]  They're told to go out.
[3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:43.360]  Have you seen in-game
[3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:45.360]  where I have troops come over with guns
[3:42:45.360 --> 3:42:47.360]  and they say you turn your bleep and camera off?
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:49.360]  Absolutely.
[3:42:49.360 --> 3:42:51.360]  Yes.
[3:42:51.360 --> 3:42:53.360]  And I know the man that was videotaping that.
[3:42:53.360 --> 3:42:55.360]  And we had a protest
[3:42:55.360 --> 3:42:57.360]  a few weeks ago in Kingman.
[3:42:57.360 --> 3:42:59.360]  And none of the press showed up
[3:42:59.360 --> 3:43:01.360]  even though they were all notified
[3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:03.360]  for oath keepers.
[3:43:03.360 --> 3:43:05.360]  That's what that man is involved in.
[3:43:05.360 --> 3:43:07.360]  Also, I have to tell you
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:09.360]  that at UNLV in Las Vegas,
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:11.360]  forced inoculations.
[3:43:11.360 --> 3:43:13.360]  My daughter got inoculated.
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:15.360]  They forced her to go.
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:17.360]  If she wanted to go to the school,
[3:43:17.360 --> 3:43:19.360]  you got to be inoculated.
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:21.360]  Now, the Kingman police
[3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:23.360]  are out of their jurisdiction
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:25.360]  all the way up by the dam
[3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:27.360]  40 miles north of the town.
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:29.360]  It's hard in Kingman.
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:31.360]  I also would like to tell you
[3:43:31.360 --> 3:43:33.360]  are you still there?
[3:43:33.360 --> 3:43:35.360]  Listen, let me just stop you.
[3:43:35.360 --> 3:43:37.360]  I can't even pay attention to all that's happening.
[3:43:37.360 --> 3:43:39.360]  I just noticed we have a We Are Change Ohio
[3:43:39.360 --> 3:43:41.360]  with MPs coming up
[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:43.360]  and talking to people.
[3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:45.360]  I mean, the military is totally taking over.
[3:43:45.360 --> 3:43:47.360]  This is red dawn, but they just do it
[3:43:47.360 --> 3:43:49.360]  and then nothing happens.
[3:43:49.360 --> 3:43:51.360]  And you're saying at the university
[3:43:51.360 --> 3:43:53.360]  they ordered your daughter and made her?
[3:43:53.360 --> 3:43:55.360]  She didn't run?
[3:43:55.360 --> 3:43:57.360]  I don't know what inoculations she had to take,
[3:43:57.360 --> 3:43:59.360]  but she said they had her take
[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:01.360]  a whole bunch of inoculations,
[3:44:01.360 --> 3:44:03.360]  even a tetanus shot.
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:05.360]  See, it's all beginning.
[3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:07.360]  Listen to this, Alex. This is very important.
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:09.360]  In the early 90s,
[3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:11.360]  my kids were sexually molested in Chicago
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:13.360]  and she got hooked up
[3:44:13.360 --> 3:44:15.360]  with the political machine there.
[3:44:15.360 --> 3:44:17.360]  They covered it up.
[3:44:17.360 --> 3:44:19.360]  The psychiatrist's name, can I mention it?
[3:44:19.360 --> 3:44:21.360]  No, I don't want to get into stuff I can't document.
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:23.360]  Besides that,
[3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:25.360]  their solution was to cover it up
[3:44:25.360 --> 3:44:27.360]  and put all my kids on dexadrine
[3:44:27.360 --> 3:44:29.360]  saying they had ADHD for years.
[3:44:29.360 --> 3:44:31.360]  And you can imagine
[3:44:31.360 --> 3:44:33.360]  what effect that has on them.
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:35.360]  Well, sir, listen, I got to get to the other calls on flu.
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:37.360]  Call me back when we're not in such a rush.
[3:44:37.360 --> 3:44:39.360]  Thank you for the great folks there getting the video.
[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:41.360]  We commend you and salute you.
[3:44:41.360 --> 3:44:43.360]  I don't doubt anything you're saying.
[3:44:43.360 --> 3:44:45.360]  I just have to be careful because you could be an operative calling in.
[3:44:45.360 --> 3:44:47.360]  I don't think you are, but I just have to watch
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:49.360]  people if something isn't substantiated.
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:51.360]  Even when I used to show the Marines
[3:44:51.360 --> 3:44:53.360]  how to confiscate our guns
[3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:55.360]  in my film, Marshall Law,
[3:44:55.360 --> 3:44:57.360]  and the film, Police Say 2000,
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:44:59.360]  people thought it was fake.
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:01.360]  They just can't understand how real this is.
[3:45:01.360 --> 3:45:03.360]  They're just acclimating, acclimating,
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:05.360]  but it's all building through a crescendo.
[3:45:05.360 --> 3:45:07.360]  Guys, pull up that We Are Change Ohio video.
[3:45:07.360 --> 3:45:09.360]  Play that.
[3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:11.360]  I know it's got some music at the first.
[3:45:11.360 --> 3:45:13.360]  This is troops in Ohio.
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:15.360]  They're just everywhere. Here it is.
[3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:17.360]  First is the Kentucky Derby.
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:19.360]  Then it's New York.
[3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:21.360]  Then it's high school games.
[3:45:21.360 --> 3:45:23.360]  Then it's high school college games.
[3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:25.360]  We have troops doing it.
[3:45:25.360 --> 3:45:27.360]  Now it's Ohio.
[3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:29.360]  This is
[3:45:29.360 --> 3:45:31.360]  Newport, Kentucky.
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:33.360]  Military checkpoints that appeared around downtown September 6.
[3:45:33.360 --> 3:45:35.360]  Officially,
[3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:37.360]  this was done
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:39.360]  for traffic control.
[3:45:39.360 --> 3:45:41.360]  See for the local river fest celebration.
[3:45:41.360 --> 3:45:43.360]  They use any excuse. Oh, the Army is just here.
[3:45:43.360 --> 3:45:45.360]  Oh, it's just normal.
[3:45:45.360 --> 3:45:47.360]  Get everybody used to it. I can't believe this.
[3:45:47.360 --> 3:45:49.360]  Look, there are the troops.
[3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:51.360]  Videos up on infowars.com.
[3:45:51.360 --> 3:45:53.360]  We got to get We Are Change Ohio on about this as soon as possible.
[3:45:53.360 --> 3:45:55.360]  I want to get Mojave Minutemen on.
[3:45:55.360 --> 3:45:57.360]  This is just, I mean, they know the people are waking up.
[3:45:57.360 --> 3:45:59.360]  They know they're going to destroy the dollar.
[3:45:59.360 --> 3:46:01.360]  The people are going to get angry, and they've got the troops standing by.
[3:46:01.360 --> 3:46:03.360]  Every time there's a shooting, they call out regular Marines now.
[3:46:03.360 --> 3:46:05.360]  Look at this.
[3:46:05.360 --> 3:46:07.360]  Look at this.
[3:46:07.360 --> 3:46:09.360]  This is total red dawn.
[3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:11.360]  Absolutely kryptonite to America.
[3:46:11.360 --> 3:46:13.360]  Look at him.
[3:46:13.360 --> 3:46:15.360]  He's got a son.
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:17.360]  Look at him.
[3:46:17.360 --> 3:46:19.360]  He's got a sidearm on.
[3:46:19.360 --> 3:46:21.360]  A Beretta or 45 Beretta 9 mil or
[3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:23.360]  my gosh.
[3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:25.360]  Heaven help us. Oh, look at all those Humvees.
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:27.360]  Look at all those troops, armed troops.
[3:46:27.360 --> 3:46:29.360]  Oh, yes, just, just helping with
[3:46:29.360 --> 3:46:31.360]  security at the river fest.
[3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:33.360]  Just any event.
[3:46:33.360 --> 3:46:35.360]  Ohio, Kentucky, Texas,
[3:46:35.360 --> 3:46:37.360]  California, Arizona,
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:39.360]  Florida. Florida's had a drill
[3:46:39.360 --> 3:46:41.360]  two months ago with, uh,
[3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:43.360]  was it 12 or 13 nations from
[3:46:43.360 --> 3:46:45.360]  America landing quote for anti-terror drills
[3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:47.360]  in LA09 admits they're going to use foreign troops
[3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:49.360]  in America.
[3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:51.360]  Foreign corporate takeover the United States.
[3:46:51.360 --> 3:46:53.360]  Absolute total hot reason.
[3:46:53.360 --> 3:46:55.360]  Folks, they're doing this so they can rob you blind.
[3:46:55.360 --> 3:46:57.360]  I want you to know, and they're acclimating
[3:46:57.360 --> 3:46:59.360]  the troops to direct the public.
[3:46:59.360 --> 3:47:01.360]  Look at this guy fresh back
[3:47:01.360 --> 3:47:03.360]  from Iraq. He's now out there.
[3:47:03.360 --> 3:47:05.360]  They're getting everybody ready
[3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:07.360]  for checkpoints. Everybody ready for control.
[3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:09.360]  This is so criminal. This is so
[3:47:09.360 --> 3:47:11.360]  evil. They're trying to number gun confiscation drills
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:13.360]  in Arcadia.
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:15.360]  Iowa. Just all over the town.
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:17.360]  Troops. Oh my God.
[3:47:17.360 --> 3:47:19.360]  The troops are questioning people right there on the video.
[3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:21.360]  Troops coming up directing
[3:47:21.360 --> 3:47:23.360]  people. Everybody getting used to troops
[3:47:23.360 --> 3:47:25.360]  eyeballing everyone. We have the
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:27.360]  internal FBI training videos for police
[3:47:27.360 --> 3:47:29.360]  and military where they train them to watch citizens.
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:31.360]  Absolutely hellish.
[3:47:31.360 --> 3:47:33.360]  Total criminality unfolding.
[3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:39.360]  We got Alex in Texas calling him with Fox News,
[3:47:39.360 --> 3:47:41.360]  Massachusetts Governor Marshall Law
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:43.360]  report. Children in school being told to take
[3:47:43.360 --> 3:47:45.360]  forcible shots.
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:47.360]  Just keep rolling. I just can't even
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:49.360]  why does this have to happen to us?
[3:47:49.360 --> 3:47:51.360]  Do you know what this means? And they're just
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:53.360]  going to keep doing it like it's no big deal
[3:47:53.360 --> 3:47:55.360]  till they finally drop the hammer. Here they
[3:47:55.360 --> 3:47:57.360]  are talking to the troops. We'll turn it up.
[3:47:59.360 --> 3:48:01.360]  Unbelievable.
[3:48:01.360 --> 3:48:03.360]  Look at the troops coming over
[3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:05.360]  trained to look for terrorists.
[3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:07.360]  I've seen two Marines earlier,
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:09.360]  but I think it's just us that's running this.
[3:48:09.360 --> 3:48:11.360]  Cool.
[3:48:11.360 --> 3:48:13.360]  So what exactly are you guys
[3:48:13.360 --> 3:48:15.360]  here for? Like what's the
[3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:17.360]  main reason?
[3:48:17.360 --> 3:48:19.360]  Questioning.
[3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:21.360]  Traffic control.
[3:48:21.360 --> 3:48:23.360]  Traffic control. Hit pause.
[3:48:23.360 --> 3:48:25.360]  Notice, notice, local events
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:27.360]  all over the country. This is what they were doing
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:29.360]  years ago. It's in Marshall Law
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:31.360]  searching three-year-old kids walking
[3:48:31.360 --> 3:48:33.360]  down the street on video photos.
[3:48:33.360 --> 3:48:35.360]  We have, I mean it's so evil.
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:37.360]  Remember the guys that ran on the field
[3:48:37.360 --> 3:48:39.360]  after the Kentucky Derby and I'm sitting there
[3:48:39.360 --> 3:48:41.360]  eating at a restaurant watching it? And troops
[3:48:41.360 --> 3:48:43.360]  jump out with guns and run on the field
[3:48:43.360 --> 3:48:45.360]  for fans? See, they don't use police
[3:48:45.360 --> 3:48:47.360]  now. It's about training you. Go back
[3:48:47.360 --> 3:48:49.360]  to the video.
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:51.360]  Traffic from
[3:48:51.360 --> 3:48:53.360]  that way to this way.
[3:48:53.360 --> 3:48:55.360]  Whole ice water is free.
[3:48:55.360 --> 3:48:57.360]  Don't cost any civilian traffic out of the
[3:48:57.360 --> 3:48:59.360]  inner city.
[3:48:59.360 --> 3:49:01.360]  We're the Army National Guard.
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:03.360]  We cover stuff inside the
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:05.360]  home land brigade.
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:07.360]  That was an emergency.
[3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:09.360]  It's for
[3:49:09.360 --> 3:49:11.360]  anything.
[3:49:11.360 --> 3:49:13.360]  Public events where
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:15.360]  local police departments don't have the manpower to cover.
[3:49:15.360 --> 3:49:17.360]  Hit pause.
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:19.360]  Total federalization.
[3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:21.360]  We'll cover more of this tomorrow.
[3:49:21.360 --> 3:49:23.360]  I just, they're
[3:49:23.360 --> 3:49:25.360]  definitely dropping the hammer right now and I love this
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:27.360]  country and my family that lives here so much.
[3:49:27.360 --> 3:49:29.360]  This is so bad. This is Nazi
[3:49:29.360 --> 3:49:31.360]  Germany. This is Soviet Russia.
[3:49:31.360 --> 3:49:33.360]  This is going to be so bad, folks. It's
[3:49:33.360 --> 3:49:35.360]  so bad.
[3:49:35.360 --> 3:49:37.360]  And when those dumb young kids try to go out and get
[3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:39.360]  our guns, it's going to be hell and that's what
[3:49:39.360 --> 3:49:41.360]  the globalists are planning on. We've got to get
[3:49:41.360 --> 3:49:43.360]  the government to back off. They got to stop
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:45.360]  their criminal activity.
[3:49:45.360 --> 3:49:47.360]  Alex in Texas and we're going to the parents
[3:49:47.360 --> 3:49:49.360]  and people with the four shots.
[3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:51.360]  What is Fox News reporting in Massachusetts?
[3:49:51.360 --> 3:49:53.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:49:53.360 --> 3:49:55.360]  Thank you for all the information and the education.
[3:49:55.360 --> 3:49:57.360]  But yes, this morning on
[3:49:57.360 --> 3:49:59.360]  Fox News around six o'clock in the morning,
[3:49:59.360 --> 3:50:01.360]  they're saying that the governor
[3:50:01.360 --> 3:50:03.360]  of Massachusetts has
[3:50:03.360 --> 3:50:05.360]  signed
[3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:07.360]  an executive order
[3:50:07.360 --> 3:50:09.360]  for non-medical personnel
[3:50:09.360 --> 3:50:11.360]  to be able to go into people's
[3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:13.360]  homes, inject them with
[3:50:13.360 --> 3:50:15.360]  the vaccine. Oh, I saw that.
[3:50:15.360 --> 3:50:17.360]  They're children. Yes, I saw that.
[3:50:17.360 --> 3:50:19.360]  Massachusetts
[3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:21.360]  non-medical workers in oculation
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:23.360]  Boston Globe last week, but they couldn't
[3:50:23.360 --> 3:50:25.360]  pass the law, I guess, because they were trying.
[3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:27.360]  He just did an executive order.
[3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:29.360]  Yes, and I said that it's
[3:50:29.360 --> 3:50:31.360]  going to go to the Senate for approval, so...
[3:50:31.360 --> 3:50:33.360]  And then notice they're
[3:50:33.360 --> 3:50:35.360]  busy denying all this is happening
[3:50:35.360 --> 3:50:37.360]  as it's happening.
[3:50:37.360 --> 3:50:39.360]  Absolutely.
[3:50:39.360 --> 3:50:41.360]  What do you think about all this?
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:43.360]  Troops everywhere.
[3:50:43.360 --> 3:50:45.360]  It's awful, Alex.
[3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:47.360]  I mean, it's hard
[3:50:47.360 --> 3:50:49.360]  to believe it. I'm surprised
[3:50:49.360 --> 3:50:51.360]  people aren't, you know,
[3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:53.360]  you're helping people
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:55.360]  wake up to this, but I know
[3:50:55.360 --> 3:50:57.360]  there's a lot of people out there in denial.
[3:50:57.360 --> 3:50:59.360]  They can't believe that our country can do this
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:01.360]  to the people.
[3:51:01.360 --> 3:51:03.360]  Look, they're going for broke. I just
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:05.360]  skipped the break. This is too important.
[3:51:05.360 --> 3:51:07.360]  Folks, this is eugenics. This is pure evil.
[3:51:07.360 --> 3:51:09.360]  They're brainwashing these dumb young kids
[3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:11.360]  in these uniforms.
[3:51:11.360 --> 3:51:13.360]  They're bringing them back from Iraq against us.
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:15.360]  This is hell.
[3:51:17.360 --> 3:51:19.360]  Anything else?
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:21.360]  No, Alex. I just...
[3:51:21.360 --> 3:51:23.360]  I hadn't heard you mention that, so I just want to...
[3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:25.360]  We've got to launch some. Thank you, God bless.
[3:51:25.360 --> 3:51:27.360]  Yeah, that's...
[3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:29.360]  You're right. I remember the story.
[3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:31.360]  Yeah, they say they're going to come in your house, take your kids.
[3:51:31.360 --> 3:51:33.360]  They're trained to clergy, tens of thousands
[3:51:33.360 --> 3:51:35.360]  to tell their flocks go to FEMA camps, turn their guns in.
[3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:37.360]  They're sending out questionnaires
[3:51:37.360 --> 3:51:39.360]  to business owners saying, will you submit to martial law,
[3:51:39.360 --> 3:51:41.360]  mainstream government document, prisonplanet.com?
[3:51:41.360 --> 3:51:43.360]  They are going to use the flu
[3:51:43.360 --> 3:51:45.360]  as their cover. Now, if we get the word out on this,
[3:51:45.360 --> 3:51:47.360]  they'll back off, but then keep
[3:51:47.360 --> 3:51:49.360]  acclimating and then go, well, large
[3:51:49.360 --> 3:51:51.360]  and have all the local good old boys.
[3:51:51.360 --> 3:51:53.360]  We're here with the troops and the Marines
[3:51:53.360 --> 3:51:55.360]  and the National Guard. What's wrong with them searching
[3:51:55.360 --> 3:51:57.360]  for stuff? We're patriots.
[3:51:57.360 --> 3:51:59.360]  You know, this fake conservatism,
[3:51:59.360 --> 3:52:01.360]  this fake liberalism, I'm just...
[3:52:01.360 --> 3:52:03.360]  Everybody needs to call
[3:52:03.360 --> 3:52:05.360]  the White House Congress. We need to get
[3:52:05.360 --> 3:52:07.360]  our congressman speaking out against this.
[3:52:07.360 --> 3:52:09.360]  The Governor's Association did write letters
[3:52:09.360 --> 3:52:11.360]  to Obama saying, we don't want martial law.
[3:52:11.360 --> 3:52:13.360]  We don't want North Com on the streets.
[3:52:13.360 --> 3:52:15.360]  My head is spinning right now.
[3:52:17.360 --> 3:52:19.360]  God help us. And I'm sending my guys
[3:52:19.360 --> 3:52:21.360]  to do just like those guys just did
[3:52:21.360 --> 3:52:23.360]  to go up and talk to the troops.
[3:52:23.360 --> 3:52:25.360]  In fact, call do right now before I forget.
[3:52:25.360 --> 3:52:27.360]  Leave a video. I want them to go up
[3:52:27.360 --> 3:52:29.360]  and talk to the troops like we are Change Ohio
[3:52:29.360 --> 3:52:31.360]  and everybody else are doing. They're already on an airplane,
[3:52:31.360 --> 3:52:33.360]  but I want that on to his phone so he knows.
[3:52:33.360 --> 3:52:35.360]  Oh, my God.
[3:52:37.360 --> 3:52:39.360]  I just...
[3:52:39.360 --> 3:52:41.360]  Because it's just happening everywhere now.
[3:52:41.360 --> 3:52:43.360]  Like I told you it would. This is the build up.
[3:52:43.360 --> 3:52:45.360]  Red Alert.
[3:52:45.360 --> 3:52:47.360]  Let's go to
[3:52:47.360 --> 3:52:49.360]  Alex in Florida.
[3:52:49.360 --> 3:52:51.360]  Children in school told to take shots.
[3:52:51.360 --> 3:52:53.360]  Alex?
[3:52:53.360 --> 3:52:55.360]  Hello?
[3:52:55.360 --> 3:52:57.360]  Yes, sir.
[3:52:57.360 --> 3:52:59.360]  Hello? Yes, Alex. Can you hear me?
[3:52:59.360 --> 3:53:01.360]  Yeah, now I can hear you.
[3:53:01.360 --> 3:53:03.360]  Yeah, I just...
[3:53:03.360 --> 3:53:05.360]  Good to speak to you and thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:09.360]  Basically, when my wife went to go ahead
[3:53:09.360 --> 3:53:11.360]  and signed my two children and my daughter,
[3:53:11.360 --> 3:53:13.360]  which is in high school and my son,
[3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:15.360]  which is an elementary school,
[3:53:15.360 --> 3:53:17.360]  they had a paper and
[3:53:17.360 --> 3:53:19.360]  basically the questions are asking
[3:53:19.360 --> 3:53:21.360]  or telling requirements
[3:53:21.360 --> 3:53:23.360]  in regards to the fluoride pill,
[3:53:23.360 --> 3:53:25.360]  the H1N1 vaccine.
[3:53:25.360 --> 3:53:27.360]  The fluoride pills.
[3:53:27.360 --> 3:53:29.360]  I remember giving me that at Margaret Sanger Elementary
[3:53:29.360 --> 3:53:31.360]  I went to in Dallas.
[3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:33.360]  They're now saying you've got to take the fluoride pills, too.
[3:53:33.360 --> 3:53:35.360]  Yeah, and that's the first time I've ever heard of it.
[3:53:35.360 --> 3:53:37.360]  So I was actually in shock,
[3:53:37.360 --> 3:53:39.360]  but thankfully because I have listened to you
[3:53:39.360 --> 3:53:41.360]  and have looked up the information on the Internet,
[3:53:41.360 --> 3:53:43.360]  I told her prior to this
[3:53:43.360 --> 3:53:45.360]  that they gave her the ability to adapt
[3:53:45.360 --> 3:53:47.360]  and to say no.
[3:53:47.360 --> 3:53:49.360]  She said no and she signed off
[3:53:49.360 --> 3:53:51.360]  on the piece of paper.
[3:53:51.360 --> 3:53:53.360]  She does have a copy of the sheet,
[3:53:53.360 --> 3:53:55.360]  but it does require...
[3:53:55.360 --> 3:53:57.360]  I'm begging you to scan it
[3:53:57.360 --> 3:53:59.360]  and send it to ridersandinfowars.com
[3:53:59.360 --> 3:54:01.360]  with a short email blurb.
[3:54:01.360 --> 3:54:03.360]  You must take the fluoride pills.
[3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:05.360]  I mean, it's body snatcher level.
[3:54:05.360 --> 3:54:07.360]  It's twilight zone.
[3:54:07.360 --> 3:54:09.360]  It's hellish.
[3:54:09.360 --> 3:54:11.360]  But Glenn Beck's not going to tell his people about it.
[3:54:11.360 --> 3:54:13.360]  All their people were just going into tyranny.
[3:54:15.360 --> 3:54:17.360]  That's correct, sir.
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:19.360]  God bless you, Alex.
[3:54:19.360 --> 3:54:21.360]  Go ahead.
[3:54:21.360 --> 3:54:23.360]  They still sell fluoride toothpaste as well
[3:54:23.360 --> 3:54:25.360]  and they're still pushing that stuff
[3:54:25.360 --> 3:54:27.360]  in a dentist's office.
[3:54:27.360 --> 3:54:29.360]  They're brain damaging people by design.
[3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:31.360]  Most of the public's completely brain damaged.
[3:54:31.360 --> 3:54:33.360]  That's why you can't even talk to them.
[3:54:33.360 --> 3:54:35.360]  I appreciate your call. God help us.
[3:54:35.360 --> 3:54:37.360]  I'm telling you, in my gut and intellectually,
[3:54:37.360 --> 3:54:39.360]  and I'm seeing all the signs,
[3:54:39.360 --> 3:54:41.360]  light, speed.
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:43.360]  Everybody, you better do...
[3:54:43.360 --> 3:54:45.360]  Banner hangs over overpasses.
[3:54:45.360 --> 3:54:47.360]  You better put up micro-FMs.
[3:54:47.360 --> 3:54:49.360]  You better put up your own websites.
[3:54:49.360 --> 3:54:51.360]  You better call into talk radio.
[3:54:51.360 --> 3:54:53.360]  You better go to city council.
[3:54:53.360 --> 3:54:55.360]  You better run around with bullhorns in the streets.
[3:54:55.360 --> 3:54:57.360]  It's time for everybody to go completely wild
[3:54:57.360 --> 3:54:59.360]  speaking out about the New World Order,
[3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:01.360]  about the troops.
[3:55:01.360 --> 3:55:03.360]  It's time to go up to the troops.
[3:55:03.360 --> 3:55:05.360]  It's time to talk to them.
[3:55:05.360 --> 3:55:07.360]  It's time to let them know
[3:55:07.360 --> 3:55:09.360]  God, these are just kids out there
[3:55:09.360 --> 3:55:11.360]  brainwashing these poor, stupid, young punks.
[3:55:13.360 --> 3:55:15.360]  Oh, God, and I've seen the internal drilling.
[3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:17.360]  They are trained into... I got it in martial law
[3:55:17.360 --> 3:55:19.360]  where the Marines put a militiamen down on his knees
[3:55:19.360 --> 3:55:22.360]  and they simulate shooting you in the back of the head.
[3:55:22.360 --> 3:55:24.360]  And I want to tell the stupid Marines
[3:55:24.360 --> 3:55:26.360]  and Army people something that aren't awake.
[3:55:26.360 --> 3:55:28.360]  They will use you up in a minute
[3:55:28.360 --> 3:55:30.360]  and they plan for you to get shoot up
[3:55:30.360 --> 3:55:32.360]  for the I-4 troops to come in after the Patriots
[3:55:32.360 --> 3:55:34.360]  defeat you.
[3:55:34.360 --> 3:55:37.360]  You're being played. God help you.
[3:55:37.360 --> 3:55:40.360]  God help you. God help us.
[3:55:40.360 --> 3:55:42.360]  It's got to really hit home how real this is.
[3:55:42.360 --> 3:55:45.360]  It's got to really hit home what's happening to us.
[3:55:47.360 --> 3:55:51.360]  Alan, New York nurse, church told to take vaccine.
[3:55:51.360 --> 3:55:53.360]  What is your clergy response team?
[3:55:53.360 --> 3:55:56.360]  FEMA, preacher tell you to take it or you go to help?
[3:55:56.360 --> 3:55:59.360]  Alex, God bless you.
[3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:01.360]  There is a lady in our church
[3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:04.360]  who is a full-time nurse at a local hospital
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:07.360]  and her story actually made the front page
[3:56:07.360 --> 3:56:09.360]  of the Schenectady Gazette.
[3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:12.360]  How are your mayors calling for martial law?
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:15.360]  See, it's everywhere. It's everywhere.
[3:56:15.360 --> 3:56:18.360]  No matter what. I remember that.
[3:56:18.360 --> 3:56:21.360]  She's been told, according to the September 19th copy
[3:56:21.360 --> 3:56:24.360]  of the Gazette, mandatory flu shots,
[3:56:24.360 --> 3:56:27.360]  not welcome health care workers can be fired
[3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:29.360]  if they refuse.
[3:56:29.360 --> 3:56:31.360]  If you'll furnish me with an address,
[3:56:31.360 --> 3:56:33.360]  I'll send you a copy of the papers
[3:56:33.360 --> 3:56:35.360]  so that you have this documented.
[3:56:35.360 --> 3:56:37.360]  Well, we can probably pull it up in this.
[3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:39.360]  What's the headline in this Schenectady News again?
[3:56:39.360 --> 3:56:42.360]  It's the Schenectady Gazette September 19th.
[3:56:42.360 --> 3:56:44.360]  And what was the headline?
[3:56:44.360 --> 3:56:46.360]  It's on the very front page.
[3:56:46.360 --> 3:56:49.360]  It says mandatory flu shots, not welcome health care workers.
[3:56:49.360 --> 3:56:51.360]  Mandatory flu shots, not welcome.
[3:56:51.360 --> 3:56:53.360]  Schenectady Gazette.
[3:56:53.360 --> 3:56:56.360]  Make sure flu shots, not welcome health care workers
[3:56:56.360 --> 3:56:59.360]  who refuse if this lady does not
[3:56:59.360 --> 3:57:01.360]  accept the flu shot by November.
[3:57:01.360 --> 3:57:02.360]  So there it is.
[3:57:02.360 --> 3:57:04.360]  We've got Obama lying and denying it
[3:57:04.360 --> 3:57:06.360]  and caller after caller after caller
[3:57:06.360 --> 3:57:07.360]  with it in the local news.
[3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:09.360]  We have the internal documents,
[3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:11.360]  troops popping up everywhere.
[3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:13.360]  God help us.
[3:57:13.360 --> 3:57:14.360]  Absolutely.
[3:57:14.360 --> 3:57:16.360]  Do you understand how they do this martial law
[3:57:16.360 --> 3:57:19.360]  in slow motion?
[3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:20.360]  Yes.
[3:57:20.360 --> 3:57:22.360]  Sorry. Go ahead.
[3:57:22.360 --> 3:57:23.360]  But Alex, God bless you.
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:25.360]  You're doing an excellent job.
[3:57:25.360 --> 3:57:26.360]  Well, what are...
[3:57:26.360 --> 3:57:28.360]  Listen, everybody's got to do banner hangs.
[3:57:28.360 --> 3:57:29.360]  There's the article.
[3:57:29.360 --> 3:57:31.360]  Schenectady Gazette.
[3:57:31.360 --> 3:57:32.360]  Mandatory flu shots, not welcome.
[3:57:32.360 --> 3:57:34.360]  Health care workers can be fired if they refuse.
[3:57:34.360 --> 3:57:35.360]  Totally criminal.
[3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:37.360]  No law, but they just say it.
[3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:41.360]  What are we going to do, folks?
[3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:42.360]  Everybody, don't wait.
[3:57:42.360 --> 3:57:44.360]  Do banner hangs against martial law.
[3:57:44.360 --> 3:57:46.360]  Banner hangs saying martial law taking over.
[3:57:46.360 --> 3:57:48.360]  Call into all, talk radio.
[3:57:48.360 --> 3:57:50.360]  I need a battle plan from Paul Watson
[3:57:50.360 --> 3:57:53.360]  explaining that we got to get the info war out now.
[3:57:53.360 --> 3:57:55.360]  They are just incrementally moving against us.
[3:57:55.360 --> 3:57:57.360]  They know that's hard to beat.
[3:57:57.360 --> 3:57:58.360]  Brainwashing the troops,
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:57:59.360]  brainwashing the police,
[3:57:59.360 --> 3:58:00.360]  brainwashing the public,
[3:58:00.360 --> 3:58:02.360]  total acclimation happening,
[3:58:02.360 --> 3:58:04.360]  foreign banks robbing us.
[3:58:04.360 --> 3:58:06.360]  This radio show,
[3:58:06.360 --> 3:58:07.360]  we're on the front lines of the info war.

[3:58:09.360 --> 3:58:11.360]  battling to save the republic.
[3:58:11.360 --> 3:58:12.360]  The republic has essentially been seized
[3:58:12.360 --> 3:58:14.360]  by foreign offshore corporations.
[3:58:14.360 --> 3:58:16.360]  The republic has fallen.
[3:58:16.360 --> 3:58:18.360]  We must resuscitate it.
