[00:00.000 --> 00:24.560]  All right, we are live on this October 14th Friday broadcast and we have got an incredible
[00:24.560 --> 00:28.880]  broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:28.880 --> 00:32.600]  The adventurer of podcasting with the smartest people out there about the whole new world
[00:32.600 --> 00:39.200]  order, Adam Curry will be joining us, David Ikes joining us and so much more.
[00:39.200 --> 00:46.480]  But wow, man, the nuclear war clock just went seconds closer to midnight.
[00:46.480 --> 00:52.400]  You've got leftist eco terrorist attacking one of the most famous paintings in the world,
[00:52.400 --> 00:53.400]  sunflowers.
[00:53.400 --> 00:58.120]  We've got that insanity just showing how they're totally trying to pull down civilization
[00:58.120 --> 01:01.600]  society like demonic zombies.
[01:01.600 --> 01:08.040]  We have got massive news dealing with it coming out that Pfizer didn't just know the shot
[01:08.040 --> 01:10.680]  didn't work, but they knew it hurt people.
[01:10.680 --> 01:13.520]  That's coming out.
[01:13.520 --> 01:16.680]  It's insane.
[01:16.680 --> 01:18.360]  Absolutely insane.
[01:18.360 --> 01:20.400]  What is going on?
[01:20.400 --> 01:24.000]  And then yeah, January 6th we know was provocative operation.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.320]  We all know Roger Stone and Steve Bannon and everybody are innocent and trying to have
[01:27.320 --> 01:28.320]  an overthrow.
[01:28.320 --> 01:33.360]  You don't attack the Capitol do that, but they're now going into overdrive literally
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.520]  trying to outlaw their political opposition 25 days out for the midterms.
[01:37.520 --> 01:41.160]  Roger pops in at the bottom of the hour.
[01:41.160 --> 01:45.080]  All the broadcasts were important, but this one I'm particularly proud of that we have
[01:45.080 --> 01:48.400]  got lined up for you today and then separately.
[01:48.400 --> 01:52.160]  I can't announce it yet, but man behind the scenes what they're doing to me, what they're
[01:52.160 --> 01:53.160]  trying to do to you.
[01:53.160 --> 01:55.720]  It's next level because they're desperate.
[01:55.720 --> 01:57.600]  They know the world's turning against them.
[01:57.600 --> 01:59.920]  The world's waking up.
[01:59.920 --> 02:00.920]  It is just insane.
[02:00.920 --> 02:01.920]  What's going down?
[02:01.920 --> 02:04.680]  It is totally insane.
[02:04.680 --> 02:05.920]  What is unfolding?
[02:05.920 --> 02:10.960]  And the good news is we have got on our side and we're going to make it through this together.
[02:10.960 --> 02:15.040]  But I just cannot, I cannot thank you as the viewers or listeners enough.
[02:15.040 --> 02:21.480]  I mean, there's nothing I want more in the world than to defeat tyranny.
[02:21.480 --> 02:24.120]  It's like a sheepdog wants to attack wolves.
[02:24.120 --> 02:25.960]  It's not like even a desire.
[02:25.960 --> 02:27.460]  It's not even a drive.
[02:27.460 --> 02:32.280]  It is an order and it's only you that keeps me in the fight.
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.480]  So I don't worship you, but almost do.
[02:35.480 --> 02:41.480]  I worship God, but that's why when you call in praising me, I'm just like, stop.
[02:41.480 --> 02:43.560]  Do you understand we're in this together?
[02:43.560 --> 02:44.920]  I love you.
[02:44.920 --> 02:45.920]  Thank you.
[02:45.920 --> 02:47.920]  Just help me fight, please.
[02:47.920 --> 02:49.960]  This what I'm doing is not special.
[02:49.960 --> 02:51.800]  What I'm doing is not incredible.
[02:51.800 --> 02:53.600]  It's what you're supposed to do.
[02:53.600 --> 02:58.760]  You tuning in shows you're awake, shows you're involved, shows you're connected, shows you
[02:58.760 --> 03:01.440]  understand and shows we're one person.
[03:01.440 --> 03:04.800]  We are together in shows right now.
[03:04.800 --> 03:08.120]  And I have no more fear.
[03:08.120 --> 03:11.480]  I never had a lot of fear, but I'm going to get trepidation and get upset and be frustrated
[03:11.480 --> 03:12.800]  and be angry.
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.280]  And now I just have peace because I know there's a real God that made us and I know there's
[03:17.280 --> 03:23.320]  a real devil who will be defeated and I know we're going to make it through this together.
[03:23.320 --> 03:28.800]  And for every person they censor and shut down, so many other beautiful people pop up
[03:28.800 --> 03:36.640]  and I'm just seeing all these new folks, brown, yellow, red, black, pink.
[03:36.640 --> 03:38.120]  Some folks have beautiful porcelain skin.
[03:38.120 --> 03:39.120]  It's true.
[03:39.120 --> 03:43.320]  Some of you call white, but beautiful ebony skin and beautiful just beautiful humans with
[03:43.320 --> 03:49.760]  beautiful eyes and beautiful souls and so beautiful and so good.
[03:49.760 --> 03:54.960]  The soul is what's so beautiful and shines through those eyes and to see this test and
[03:54.960 --> 03:58.840]  what it's really all about to show who's who is incredible.
[03:58.840 --> 04:02.320]  A lot of people are going to tap out, a lot of people are going to back down, a lot of
[04:02.320 --> 04:06.760]  people are going to roll over and try to hide, but this broadcast is not about hiding.
[04:06.760 --> 04:09.920]  This broadcast is about victory and overcoming.
[04:09.920 --> 04:17.640]  And when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against
[04:17.640 --> 04:18.640]  it.
[04:18.640 --> 04:22.200]  And I'm not that standard, but we together collectively, our guests, our callers, the
[04:22.200 --> 04:29.880]  crew, our reporters, everything that's in force is, is the standard that when the enemy
[04:29.880 --> 04:38.920]  comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it and I can feel
[04:38.920 --> 04:47.360]  my spirit in the wind as that, as that standard, as that flag going forward, I could feel the
[04:47.360 --> 04:52.000]  energy and the resistance and the power of the people and I am just so honored to be
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.400]  here with you.
[04:53.400 --> 04:54.880]  God bless you all.
[04:54.880 --> 04:55.960]  We'll be right back.
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.760]  The transmission kicks off in 60 seconds.
[05:00.760 --> 05:03.200]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[05:03.200 --> 05:10.080]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge of the spirit.
[05:10.080 --> 05:14.200]  And when we talk about the products at infomercial.com, they all blow you away.
[05:14.200 --> 05:19.000]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be, we'll be customers.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.280]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back in stock, it's X3.
[05:23.280 --> 05:29.680]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,
[05:29.680 --> 05:33.880]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[05:33.880 --> 05:40.360]  So X3, despite the fact that it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right
[05:40.360 --> 05:46.160]  now at infowarstore.com and it funds the Info War, which is a 360 win.
[05:46.160 --> 05:50.200]  If you've got experience, the power of iodine takes two weeks to kick out on average.
[05:50.200 --> 06:01.200]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off, X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[06:20.200 --> 06:49.360]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:49.360 --> 06:52.280]  Gold and Goose, that's the brass ring.
[06:52.280 --> 06:54.960]  That's what the New World Order wants.
[06:54.960 --> 06:59.480]  And PayPal, a totally New World Order company, Peter Till hasn't owned it in over a decade.
[06:59.480 --> 07:03.560]  When I got banned on PayPal like four years ago, they go, well, that Peter Till's a conservative.
[07:03.560 --> 07:04.560]  He would ban you.
[07:04.560 --> 07:05.560]  He didn't own it.
[07:05.560 --> 07:10.440]  He didn't have any interest in it anymore or no controlling interest.
[07:10.440 --> 07:14.160]  They came out and said, if we don't like what you say on climate change, open borders, election
[07:14.160 --> 07:21.840]  law, you name it, we are going to find you $2,500.
[07:21.840 --> 07:29.200]  So I want to play actually first this J.P. Sears great little piece that the news host
[07:29.200 --> 07:34.280]  and comedian just released dealing with this because it's all completely accurate.
[07:34.280 --> 07:35.280]  It's all real.
[07:35.280 --> 07:39.200]  He just puts it in a comical fashion, except he says the power is the people rallying and
[07:39.200 --> 07:41.680]  saying no, that's what's defeating PayPal.
[07:41.680 --> 07:45.680]  And that's true, but PayPal didn't do this on its own.
[07:45.680 --> 07:47.240]  This is the admitted agenda.
[07:47.240 --> 07:52.280]  This is already in place in China, going in in India and many other places.
[07:52.280 --> 07:58.280]  So the secret to this is, yes, we can do it until all the platforms do it.
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.440]  And that's what they're putting in place.
[07:59.440 --> 08:02.320]  And then you must follow every directive they give you.
[08:02.320 --> 08:04.560]  And it won't just be the latest leftist directive.
[08:04.560 --> 08:07.240]  Once the chains are on, it will be depopulation.
[08:07.240 --> 08:08.600]  It will be sterilization.
[08:08.600 --> 08:10.680]  It will be death.
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.840]  Total surveillance, total control.
[08:13.840 --> 08:20.360]  So J.P. Sears, I give him an A plus, a 95, but he didn't get a hundred because he didn't
[08:20.360 --> 08:24.080]  explain the Achilles heel.
[08:24.080 --> 08:33.240]  Once they get this in system wide, once they make college students or federal workers or
[08:33.240 --> 08:37.800]  certain groups accept a social credit score, then it's for everybody else later, the military,
[08:37.800 --> 08:38.800]  then it's for everybody.
[08:38.800 --> 08:42.920]  And that's when they get us, but they are trying it and now's the key time to beat it
[08:42.920 --> 08:45.840]  and say no when humanity is waking up and is saying no.
[08:45.840 --> 08:51.360]  So the front and center is this, they may able to freeze your bank account, control
[08:51.360 --> 08:54.360]  your digital currency, force you onto this, get rid of cash.
[08:54.360 --> 08:55.360]  That's the holy grail.
[08:55.360 --> 08:56.680]  That's the mark of the beast.
[08:56.680 --> 09:04.400]  And so here's the piece where J.P. Sears really knocks it all apart.
[09:04.400 --> 09:11.480]  All right, we're making billions of dollars and that's still not enough.
[09:11.480 --> 09:15.960]  We need to figure out how we can make even more money from our users.
[09:15.960 --> 09:19.800]  You mean even more money than we already charge for transactions?
[09:19.800 --> 09:22.720]  Yes, we're just making peanuts.
[09:22.720 --> 09:29.040]  We need to find a way to massively spike our profits by asserting more control over our
[09:29.040 --> 09:30.640]  users as people.
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.080]  Well, that'll be tough to think of in a way that's ethical.
[09:35.080 --> 09:36.440]  I've got an idea.
[09:36.440 --> 09:38.760]  Yes, Cletus, what is it?
[09:38.760 --> 09:42.840]  Well, what if we treat our users like they're criminals?
[09:42.840 --> 09:44.760]  I like where you're going with this.
[09:44.760 --> 09:45.760]  Say more.
[09:45.760 --> 09:50.520]  Yeah, like what if we find our users $2,500?
[09:50.520 --> 09:52.000]  Find them for what?
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.800]  We find them $2,500 anytime they speak misinformation.
[09:58.800 --> 10:03.280]  And who determines what this misinformation is?
[10:03.280 --> 10:04.280]  We do.
[10:04.280 --> 10:05.280]  I like it.
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.600]  Well, even if we find them, sir, no one's going to just willingly pay us for a fine
[10:09.600 --> 10:10.680]  like that.
[10:10.680 --> 10:12.000]  They won't have to.
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.320]  We take it from them by directly debiting their accounts because we hold all their money.
[10:18.320 --> 10:20.600]  What do the numbers on this look like?
[10:20.600 --> 10:22.800]  I don't think that's a good idea.
[10:22.800 --> 10:23.800]  Silence!
[10:23.800 --> 10:26.960]  Cletus, what do our projections on this look like?
[10:26.960 --> 10:33.800]  Well, we have 429 million users, and we determine what misinformation is based on the working
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.760]  definition of misinformation is anything we disagree with.
[10:37.760 --> 10:42.520]  Then we correlate that with the statistical analysis we ran of how many people will eventually
[10:42.520 --> 10:48.240]  say something that we disagree with, and we find that's all of them.
[10:48.240 --> 10:55.120]  Then we take all of them, our 429 million users, and multiply that by the misinformation
[10:55.120 --> 11:06.080]  fine slash take of $2,500, and that equals $1,072,500 million in new revenue.
[11:06.080 --> 11:09.760]  That is amazing.
[11:09.760 --> 11:12.400]  Are there any downsides to this policy?
[11:12.400 --> 11:14.560]  None that I've been able to think of.
[11:14.560 --> 11:15.760]  Exactly.
[11:15.760 --> 11:17.440]  No downsides at all.
[11:17.440 --> 11:19.440]  I think this is a bad idea.
[11:19.440 --> 11:22.400]  Put this out of the new terms of service immediately.
[11:22.400 --> 11:26.000]  Sure thing, boss.
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.480]  Okay, so it turns out there was a downside we didn't think of.
[11:32.480 --> 11:33.480]  Really?
[11:33.480 --> 11:34.480]  What's that?
[11:34.480 --> 11:35.920]  We're getting major backlash.
[11:35.920 --> 11:37.640]  People don't like the policy.
[11:37.640 --> 11:38.880]  Who cares what people like?
[11:38.880 --> 11:40.640]  This is amazing for us.
[11:40.640 --> 11:42.320]  We ran the numbers.
[11:42.320 --> 11:43.760]  Excellent points, sir.
[11:43.760 --> 11:45.640]  But we're hemorrhaging users.
[11:45.640 --> 11:48.920]  People are closing their accounts left and right.
[11:48.920 --> 11:50.800]  No longer using PayPal.
[11:50.800 --> 11:53.240]  Who told these people they could just stop using PayPal?
[11:53.240 --> 11:55.480]  They can't just do that?
[11:55.480 --> 11:57.280]  They actually can.
[11:57.280 --> 11:59.800]  I didn't know they could just do that.
[11:59.800 --> 12:04.000]  Well they need to stop it because I don't like that they're doing that.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.720]  But they are.
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.800]  It looks like this new scheme to make us a lot more money by serving our users much better
[12:10.800 --> 12:17.640]  with this new policy could end up costing us a lot if we don't act fast.
[12:17.640 --> 12:21.240]  All right, we need to backtrack fast.
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.440]  We need a statement that's going to win back the trust of our users and keep them on the
[12:25.440 --> 12:26.440]  platform.
[12:26.440 --> 12:28.640]  Cletus, any ideas?
[12:28.640 --> 12:33.000]  Yeah, we could just tell people we did it by accident.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  That's brilliant.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.440]  They'll definitely go for that.
[12:36.440 --> 12:38.000]  I don't think they will.
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.440]  How would that sound?
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.760]  I've already written up our statement, sir.
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.920]  PayPal is not finding people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be
[12:47.920 --> 12:50.120]  inserted in our policy.
[12:50.120 --> 12:53.000]  We're sorry for the confusion this has caused.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.360]  That's perfect.
[12:54.360 --> 12:56.440]  Did you write that in crayon?
[12:56.440 --> 12:58.600]  Publish it!
[12:58.600 --> 13:03.280]  Well, have we fully recovered yet?
[13:03.280 --> 13:06.320]  It looks like our statement didn't exactly work, sir.
[13:06.320 --> 13:07.320]  What do you mean?
[13:07.320 --> 13:09.280]  Well, things have gotten even worse.
[13:09.280 --> 13:12.160]  We've lost $6 billion in market cap.
[13:12.160 --> 13:13.560]  How could that be?
[13:13.560 --> 13:18.520]  We told these morons we didn't mean to do the thing that we deliberately did.
[13:18.520 --> 13:23.240]  Yeah, but it's almost like they somehow just know.
[13:23.240 --> 13:27.960]  They're still leaving the platform in droves because they know what we're about.
[13:27.960 --> 13:30.680]  I can't believe our statement didn't work.
[13:30.680 --> 13:35.320]  We're powerful big tech and our users are just moronic people.
[13:35.320 --> 13:36.880]  Another great point, sir.
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.600]  But it looks like when people unite, they're seemingly more powerful than we are.
[13:42.600 --> 13:49.040]  Enough of your kumbaya hippie bulls**t losing $6 billion in market cap almost overnight.
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.840]  We need a new strategy to boost our revenue and fast.
[13:53.840 --> 13:58.720]  We could find people for trying to leave the platform.
[13:58.720 --> 14:00.720]  Say more about that.
[14:00.720 --> 14:08.640]  All right, great job, J.P. Sears to the full video on his YouTube site and his website.
[14:08.640 --> 14:10.320]  There it is on screen.
[14:10.320 --> 14:13.040]  But here's the problem.
[14:13.040 --> 14:15.440]  Since he cut that video, they came out and said, you know what?
[14:15.440 --> 14:17.320]  We are going to go ahead and find you.
[14:17.320 --> 14:20.880]  But only if you're a racist, but they can find anything they want.
[14:20.880 --> 14:24.880]  But understand, what PayPal's doing is the whole model of the whole thing we've been
[14:24.880 --> 14:27.520]  harping on for decades, it's here.
[14:27.520 --> 14:34.520]  So once they get it in place everywhere, and Visa and MasterCard and J.P. Morgan Chase
[14:34.520 --> 14:39.520]  just took Kanye off of his bank account, it's here.
[14:39.520 --> 14:42.760]  We've got to find the companies and the banks that will work with us.
[14:42.760 --> 14:46.560]  And that's what I'm doing behind the scenes, got some big stuff ready to launch.
[14:46.560 --> 14:47.560]  Not BS.
[14:47.560 --> 14:50.280]  We're, oh, we got a place for you to bank, it's actually for you and then it really
[14:50.280 --> 14:51.280]  isn't.
[14:51.280 --> 14:54.280]  But the real deal with some big players, there's a lot of folks that want to go along
[14:54.280 --> 14:55.600]  with this that are very successful.
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.840]  So we've been the main target of this, and as Nietzsche said, that which doesn't kill
[15:00.840 --> 15:03.200]  you makes you stronger, only makes you stronger.
[15:03.200 --> 15:06.840]  Because we didn't give up, we've learned a lot of this and we're ready for it.
[15:06.840 --> 15:09.480]  But that's currently going on against InfoWars.
[15:09.480 --> 15:12.440]  So that's why you're prayer, that's why you're supportive, that's why you're worried about
[15:12.440 --> 15:13.600]  this so critical.
[15:13.600 --> 15:17.640]  We're in the end game now.
[15:17.640 --> 15:18.640]  That's where we are.
[15:18.640 --> 15:21.920]  All right, I want to talk about solutions when we come back.
[15:21.920 --> 15:29.160]  Taking footage of leftists finally waking up and confronting their globalist controllers.
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.400]  Not just AOC getting confronted about nuclear war, but Rashid Tlaib being confronted about
[15:33.400 --> 15:35.720]  pedophilia and the Democratic Party.
[15:35.720 --> 15:36.720]  That's coming up.
[15:36.720 --> 15:41.640]  But please remember, InfoWarsStore.com has products ready to ship to you.
[15:41.640 --> 15:44.280]  The globalists can't take it down because it's in bankruptcy.
[15:44.280 --> 15:47.600]  Chapter five, we're going to continue on as long as you support ready to ship products
[15:47.600 --> 15:48.600]  to you right now.
[15:48.600 --> 15:52.600]  Go code 1776, get you an additional 10% off at checkout.
[15:52.600 --> 16:00.240]  That means I'm a product 50% off like X3 or DNA Force Plus, you get 60.
[16:00.240 --> 16:02.040]  It's our best seller.
[16:02.040 --> 16:05.360]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[16:05.360 --> 16:10.400]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[16:10.400 --> 16:14.320]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[16:14.320 --> 16:17.760]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[16:17.760 --> 16:23.200]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[16:23.200 --> 16:24.200]  function of the body.
[16:24.200 --> 16:29.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.560]  need to live and be healthy.
[16:31.560 --> 16:33.840]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[16:33.840 --> 16:35.600]  And so much of the food is debased.
[16:35.600 --> 16:40.680]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body defenses
[16:40.680 --> 16:41.680]  with a product like this.
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.360]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[16:45.360 --> 16:48.880]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[16:48.880 --> 16:53.040]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally
[16:53.040 --> 16:59.960]  back in stock at infowarkshore.com for 50% off vitamin mineral fusion back in stock infowarkshore.com

[17:10.960 --> 17:11.960]  media.

[17:17.680 --> 17:21.080]  and kept info wars and free speech on the air and I thank you.
[17:21.080 --> 17:25.520]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them and

[18:07.440 --> 18:09.160]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[18:09.160 --> 18:12.720]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[18:12.720 --> 18:16.600]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[18:16.600 --> 18:20.040]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves, it doesn't just
[18:20.040 --> 18:23.400]  give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system, but it also blocks the
[18:23.400 --> 18:28.480]  bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.

[20:00.720 --> 20:21.080]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, I'm Alex Jones, your host, thank you so much
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.080]  for joining us.
[20:22.080 --> 20:27.080]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.080 --> 20:35.000]  So there's a lot of Achilles heels the globalists have people waking up, people saying no, people
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.480]  being independent, people sporting local business, people getting back to God's number one.
[20:40.480 --> 20:45.720]  And it's also their own constituents waking up to the fact that you're in a cult, you're
[20:45.720 --> 20:47.440]  being run in the ground.
[20:47.440 --> 20:51.320]  So all over the country, I've got dozens of clips here of this, I'm going to just play
[20:51.320 --> 20:57.320]  two because of time constraints, dozens of clips of AOC getting confronted, we talked
[20:57.320 --> 21:02.120]  about it yesterday, of Rashid Tlaib being confronted by their constituents who were angry in mass
[21:02.120 --> 21:07.840]  over the pedophilia support, over the nuclear war support, over all of it.
[21:07.840 --> 21:11.560]  And as soon as these people finally wake up, that the average Christian or conservative
[21:11.560 --> 21:17.000]  or white person or gun owner or Republican is not their enemy, it's game over for the
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.880]  globalist because our enemy is the Democratic Party and the CCP and Klaus Schwab and Bill
[21:21.880 --> 21:22.880]  Gates.
[21:22.880 --> 21:28.440]  So here it is in New York, again, AOC being confronted about nuclear war.
[21:28.440 --> 21:34.560]  Congresswoman, none of this matters unless there's a nuclear war, which you voted to
[21:34.560 --> 21:40.360]  send arms and weapons to Ukraine, post the adverts, she's left the Democratic Party.
[21:40.360 --> 21:43.000]  Because there are some war hunts.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.800]  You originally voted, you ran as an outsider, yet you've been voting to start this war
[21:48.800 --> 21:49.800]  in Ukraine.
[21:49.800 --> 21:54.720]  You're voting to start a thermonuclear war with Russia and China, why are you playing
[21:54.720 --> 21:59.200]  with the lives of American citizens, you're playing with our lives.
[21:59.200 --> 22:02.880]  There will be no neighbors if there's a nuclear bomb.
[22:02.880 --> 22:07.360]  You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis.
[22:07.360 --> 22:12.840]  You're a coward, you're a progressive socialist, where are you against the warm mobilization?
[22:12.840 --> 22:20.120]  He's telling the right truth, you have done nothing, Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts where
[22:20.120 --> 22:25.800]  you've shown cowardice, I believed in you and you became the very thing you sought to
[22:25.800 --> 22:26.800]  fought against.
[22:26.800 --> 22:29.640]  That's what you've become.
[22:29.640 --> 22:33.560]  You are the establishment and you are the reason why everybody will end up in a nuclear
[22:33.560 --> 22:40.680]  war unless you choose to stand up right now and denounce the Democratic Party.
[22:40.680 --> 22:49.200]  Until you do that, choose always the establishment, okay, simple, are you going to stop nuclear
[22:49.200 --> 22:50.200]  war?
[22:50.200 --> 22:51.200]  Yes or no?
[22:51.200 --> 22:53.200]  There is no line.
[22:53.200 --> 22:58.520]  Little tip to the left, when Vogue magazine and CNN's promote you, you're for the establishment.
[22:58.520 --> 23:06.600]  You know that, then let's take it up right now because this is the only thing that matters.
[23:06.600 --> 23:07.600]  That's good.
[23:07.600 --> 23:10.920]  That's good.
[23:10.920 --> 23:12.160]  And obviously, they think socialism is going to save them.
[23:12.160 --> 23:14.920]  They don't know the big banks are funding that to make them dependent, but they're at
[23:14.920 --> 23:16.960]  least getting that she doesn't represent them.
[23:16.960 --> 23:19.440]  And there she is in a college with like 50 people.
[23:19.440 --> 23:20.680]  No one wants to see her.
[23:20.680 --> 23:21.680]  Nobody cares.
[23:21.680 --> 23:27.240]  I said I was going to college not bragging, 10,000 show up in one day, no announcement.
[23:27.240 --> 23:30.100]  People hear one day I'm coming, no big push, 10,000.
[23:30.100 --> 23:32.520]  These people, Trump shows up 100,000.
[23:32.520 --> 23:35.320]  These people are a joke, they're a straw dog.
[23:35.320 --> 23:39.360]  They're a paper tiger, but people don't call them on that.
[23:39.360 --> 23:45.480]  So here he is, Rashid Tlaib, this is happening in Michigan, this is happening in Minnesota.
[23:45.480 --> 23:47.520]  We're good job with the Muslims.
[23:47.520 --> 23:52.640]  They're like, you're going to literally have pornographic stuff for middle schoolers.
[23:52.640 --> 23:53.640]  I've seen these books.
[23:53.640 --> 23:54.720]  I can't show them on here.
[23:54.720 --> 24:02.240]  They are children having sex with their teachers, men giving children below jobs, sexually assaulting
[24:02.240 --> 24:03.240]  them.
[24:03.240 --> 24:07.760]  I've shown in Austin, that's in all the middle schools in Austin, sixth, seventh graders,
[24:07.760 --> 24:14.320]  eighth, yeah, eighth graders, literal cartoon porn.
[24:14.320 --> 24:17.360]  I mean, I've never looked at child porn in my life, thank God, never seen it until I
[24:17.360 --> 24:19.880]  looked at the book when we covered it last year.
[24:19.880 --> 24:25.680]  And I looked at the book that was at the Austin library, school library, Austin AISD library.
[24:25.680 --> 24:30.200]  And I was like, okay, I hear this, I'm like, what the hell is literally children being
[24:30.200 --> 24:31.560]  raped by adults?
[24:31.560 --> 24:35.200]  And I'm like, oh my God, I have been assaulted.
[24:35.200 --> 24:36.800]  I have never seen something like this.
[24:36.800 --> 24:38.480]  I would never want to see this.
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.560]  And now I'm looking at children being raped.
[24:42.560 --> 24:47.480]  It's just, it's who these people are.
[24:47.480 --> 24:49.400]  And they claim they have the moral high ground.
[24:49.400 --> 24:52.120]  So here's Tlaib being confronted about it.
[24:52.120 --> 24:53.920]  I'm not against the body camera.
[24:53.920 --> 24:54.920]  I'm against anything.
[24:54.920 --> 24:55.920]  I'm against the books.
[24:55.920 --> 24:56.920]  Okay.
[24:56.920 --> 25:01.000]  Don't sit here and say that people are sitting here, coming to you guys.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.040]  They're just telling you, oh, we want these books out.
[25:04.040 --> 25:05.480]  You worried about the gay people?
[25:05.480 --> 25:06.480]  No problem.
[25:06.480 --> 25:07.480]  We're not worried about the gay people.
[25:07.480 --> 25:08.480]  We're worried about our children.
[25:08.480 --> 25:09.480]  Okay.
[25:09.480 --> 25:15.440]  And second of all, I don't want to hear anybody, okay, saying they're saying, oh, you guys
[25:15.440 --> 25:17.600]  are offending the gay.
[25:17.600 --> 25:18.600]  These are kids.
[25:18.600 --> 25:19.600]  They can be 18.
[25:19.600 --> 25:22.200]  If they want to become gay, let them become gay.
[25:22.200 --> 25:23.200]  Who cares?
[25:23.200 --> 25:25.800]  It's not our problem.
[25:25.800 --> 25:29.520]  We don't want kids to have access to these books.
[25:29.520 --> 25:30.520]  It's nice and simple.
[25:30.520 --> 25:33.600]  I'm not going to address this situation no more.
[25:33.600 --> 25:34.600]  It is.
[25:34.600 --> 25:35.600]  It is what it is.
[25:35.600 --> 25:39.120]  And the only person that's behind this is Washeeda Tlaib.
[25:39.120 --> 25:40.120]  Cool.
[25:40.120 --> 25:41.120]  Washeeda Tlaib.
[25:41.120 --> 25:42.120]  Cool.
[25:42.120 --> 25:43.120]  There it is.
[25:43.120 --> 25:44.120]  It's nice and simple.
[25:44.120 --> 25:45.120]  Holy shit.
[25:45.120 --> 25:46.120]  Holy shit.
[25:46.120 --> 25:48.800]  Too much cussing on this, I guess.
[25:48.800 --> 25:50.520]  We didn't bleep it, so we got to turn it off.
[25:50.520 --> 25:54.600]  But it was Christy Lee, reporter for Info Wars.
[25:54.600 --> 25:59.080]  She moved here two years ago with her family and her four children with her husband, and
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.040]  when she put her child in the AISD, she comes to me and says, I'm going to cover this book
[26:04.040 --> 26:05.040]  when you look at it.
[26:05.040 --> 26:06.040]  And I'd heard about the book.
[26:06.040 --> 26:07.040]  I never looked.
[26:07.040 --> 26:08.040]  I went, sure.
[26:08.040 --> 26:09.040]  She goes, you know, there's pedophilia.
[26:09.040 --> 26:10.840]  And I'm like, I really...
[26:10.840 --> 26:11.840]  She goes, just look at it.
[26:11.840 --> 26:12.840]  So I go into my office.
[26:12.840 --> 26:14.560]  About a day goes by, I don't look at it.
[26:14.560 --> 26:16.560]  And I go, okay, let me see this book.
[26:16.560 --> 26:21.680]  And I open it up, and like three pages in, the teacher seduces the eight-year-old and
[26:21.680 --> 26:23.520]  is having sex with him.
[26:23.520 --> 26:25.080]  And I mean, it's like porno.
[26:25.080 --> 26:31.600]  I mean, it's an adult sexually assaulting a child, performing a blowjob on him, and then
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.400]  bidding him over the table and raping him, sodomizing him.
[26:37.400 --> 26:38.840]  That's America.
[26:38.840 --> 26:43.400]  That's what seven graders and eight graders get in Austin, Texas.
[26:43.400 --> 26:50.960]  And it's all over the world, the same book.
[26:50.960 --> 26:54.440]  When she tried to go to city council and show it, they detained her and threw her out.
[26:54.440 --> 26:57.440]  Oh, you can't show child porn on TV.
[26:57.440 --> 26:58.440]  Exactly.
[26:58.440 --> 27:04.200]  Adults can't see it because they're showing it to children without your knowledge.
[27:04.200 --> 27:05.600]  And I'll be completely honest with you.
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.880]  Listers in mail, there's a bunch more books that are in bookstores and in libraries, school
[27:11.880 --> 27:12.880]  libraries.
[27:12.880 --> 27:13.880]  I won't even open them up.
[27:13.880 --> 27:15.440]  And that's why they're winning.
[27:15.440 --> 27:16.440]  Because we won't even...
[27:16.440 --> 27:17.680]  And I'll be honest, I'm weak.
[27:17.680 --> 27:22.160]  I won't look at it.
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.160]  We won't look at it, no one will prosecute it because it's so embarrassing because the
[27:26.160 --> 27:28.640]  authority figures, the schools are doing this.
[27:28.640 --> 27:31.680]  Just like they're injecting the kids with poison shots that give them blood clots and
[27:31.680 --> 27:34.400]  heart attacks and destroy their immune systems.
[27:34.400 --> 27:35.560]  This is death.
[27:35.560 --> 27:36.840]  This is suicide.
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.080]  This is the murder of humanity.
[27:41.080 --> 27:54.720]  What the good news is, they're trying to put fantasies in children's heads so that when
[27:54.720 --> 28:00.480]  an adult tries to have sex with them, when they're 10 years old, they bend over to desk
[28:00.480 --> 28:05.120]  and their teacher rapes them.
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.840]  These are pedophiles running a lot of these schools and they're handing your kid a book
[28:09.840 --> 28:14.040]  of the teacher having sex with you.
[28:14.040 --> 28:18.200]  Imagine how much worse it is than we even know.
[28:18.200 --> 28:22.240]  And that's why when these courts and these systems attack us, you need to know they're
[28:22.240 --> 28:24.520]  on the side of this and they support this.
[28:24.520 --> 28:26.120]  They don't have the moral high ground.
[28:26.120 --> 28:28.080]  These people are devils.
[28:28.080 --> 28:32.920]  But all they gotta do is support people fighting tyranny and withdraw support from them.
[28:32.920 --> 28:36.760]  Just withdraw support from them and nothing to do with them and just set up your own family,
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.600]  your own system and come out of Babylon, come out of Egypt, come out of it.
[28:41.600 --> 28:43.200]  All right, so that was key.
[28:43.200 --> 28:49.280]  When we come back, Roger Stone's on, but I first want to hit the attack on the arguably
[28:49.280 --> 28:54.800]  of the modern lease of the most famous painting in the world, Sunflowers, attack with red
[28:54.800 --> 28:59.560]  paint by leftist crazies.
[28:59.560 --> 29:02.040]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[29:02.040 --> 29:08.680]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge tip of the
[29:08.680 --> 29:09.680]  spirit.
[29:09.680 --> 29:12.680]  And when we talk about the products in infomercial.com, they all blow you away.
[29:12.680 --> 29:17.800]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be repeat customers.
[29:17.800 --> 29:22.040]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back in Stockings X3.
[29:22.040 --> 29:28.520]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,
[29:28.520 --> 29:32.680]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[29:32.680 --> 29:39.160]  So X3, despite the fact that it was running iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right
[29:39.160 --> 29:44.960]  now at infowarstore.com, and it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[29:44.960 --> 29:49.000]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, takes two weeks to get that on average.
[29:49.000 --> 29:52.840]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off.
[29:52.840 --> 29:59.880]  X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[29:59.880 --> 30:04.680]  Think about a world without info wars.
[30:04.680 --> 30:09.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.320]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[30:14.320 --> 30:19.440]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[30:19.440 --> 30:26.920]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[30:26.920 --> 30:30.400]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[30:30.400 --> 30:36.160]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[30:36.160 --> 30:40.640]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[30:40.640 --> 30:42.400]  I don't take the credit.
[30:42.400 --> 30:44.240]  I give you the credit.
[30:44.240 --> 30:48.640]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[30:48.640 --> 30:50.400]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[30:50.400 --> 30:59.680]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[30:59.680 --> 31:04.320]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the globalist stone documents from their own
[31:04.320 --> 31:06.360]  admissions is now happening.
[31:06.360 --> 31:10.840]  Info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's because of your
[31:10.840 --> 31:16.880]  backing of this operation that I could steadfastly despite the censorship and the boycotts and
[31:16.880 --> 31:22.720]  the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[31:22.720 --> 31:23.720]  in the fight together.
[31:23.720 --> 31:29.520]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[31:29.520 --> 31:33.440]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[31:33.440 --> 31:38.960]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[31:38.960 --> 31:39.960]  It's unsustainable.
[31:39.960 --> 31:44.640]  So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[31:44.640 --> 31:50.000]  Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.480]  can so that I can continue to persevere.

[31:53.480 --> 31:55.720]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[31:55.720 --> 31:56.720]  Thank you for your support.

[33:01.400 --> 33:17.280]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:17.280 --> 33:19.280]  Big brother.
[33:19.280 --> 33:22.400]  Mainstream media.
[33:22.400 --> 33:23.400]  Government coverups.
[33:23.400 --> 33:24.400]  You want answers?
[33:24.400 --> 33:25.400]  Well, so does he.
[33:25.400 --> 33:34.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:34.480 --> 33:42.800]  You know, I was right out of high school then, so it was 30 years ago.
[33:42.800 --> 33:46.360]  And Vincent Van Gogh display came to Texas.
[33:46.360 --> 33:48.920]  I can't remember whether it was Dallas or Houston.
[33:48.920 --> 33:50.800]  I think it was Dallas.
[33:50.800 --> 33:56.560]  And so I went with some family and a girlfriend, and we went in and saw sunflowers and some
[33:56.560 --> 33:57.560]  of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings.
[33:57.560 --> 33:59.440]  They were amazing to see in person.
[33:59.440 --> 34:02.880]  Well to show you who the climate terrorists are, supported by the banks, supported by
[34:02.880 --> 34:09.280]  the media, in London, arguably the most important painting in the world, you can say it's the
[34:09.280 --> 34:13.920]  Sistine Chapel, you can say it's Montelisa, or you can say it's sunflowers, I mean there's
[34:13.920 --> 34:15.400]  those three paintings they debate about it.
[34:15.400 --> 34:18.200]  I'd probably say Sistine Chapel had a chance to see that in Rome.
[34:18.200 --> 34:20.000]  It was amazing.
[34:20.000 --> 34:26.680]  But you have so-called climate activists wearing nylon clothes made out of oil, with cell phones
[34:26.680 --> 34:36.440]  made out of oil and earth minerals, throwing tomato soup onto Vincent Van Gogh's sunflowers.
[34:36.440 --> 34:41.520]  Now later we learned there was a glass sheet over it, but the point is because it's oil
[34:41.520 --> 34:43.920]  and made out of oil, it's bad.
[34:43.920 --> 34:48.320]  And because, well we're going to kill the earth, let's kill this painting, as if they're
[34:48.320 --> 34:51.600]  the guardians of the earth, as if they're the bosses, and it's a bunch of dumb-down
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.960]  college freshman girls, funded by the big banks, they want to make you guilty, so Al
[34:56.960 --> 35:01.000]  Gore and George Soros can charge you a carbon tax to track everything you're doing.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  These people are a menace.
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.200]  They block roads, they block trains, they sabotage factories, let us like them.
[35:07.200 --> 35:11.080]  Extinction Rebellion is the ground troops of the World Economic Forum.
[35:11.080 --> 35:29.440]  Here's a club of them attacking Vincent Van Gogh's painting.
[35:29.440 --> 35:31.640]  You know her pink hair dyes made out of petroleum.
[35:31.640 --> 35:36.360]  They think they're cleaning their hands like little demonic monkeys.
[35:36.360 --> 35:46.960]  What is the art or life, is it worth more than food, worth more than justice?
[35:46.960 --> 35:53.880]  Are you more concerned about the protection of the painting or the protection of our planet
[35:53.880 --> 35:54.880]  and people?
[35:54.880 --> 36:00.400]  The cost of living crisis is part of the cost of oil crisis.
[36:00.400 --> 36:06.920]  Alright, so this is the ground forces of the New World Order, and their two-year climate
[36:06.920 --> 36:10.680]  lockdowns already killed 65 million people, cutting off fossil fuels will kill billions
[36:10.680 --> 36:11.960]  as estimated.
[36:11.960 --> 36:13.840]  These are truly monsters.
[36:13.840 --> 36:18.520]  These are the idiot depopulationists of the New World Order.
[36:18.520 --> 36:22.280]  Shifting gears, they just had more congressional hearings, not about the open borders, not
[36:22.280 --> 36:26.120]  about the war in Russia, not about nuclear war, not about the value currencies, not about
[36:26.120 --> 36:31.480]  inflation, not about the Keystone pipeline, not about the Nord Stream blown up, not about
[36:31.480 --> 36:37.160]  the crime of the streets, but about Roger Stone with maps as him as a mastermind with
[36:37.160 --> 36:41.560]  Steve Bannon, even though they don't get along, and war rooms were all in, planning
[36:41.560 --> 36:44.800]  attacks in 25 days from the midterms.
[36:44.800 --> 36:45.800]  It's imminent.
[36:45.800 --> 36:47.760]  Again, Roger Stone's planning something.
[36:47.760 --> 36:50.440]  Meanwhile, we have CNN cuts.
[36:50.440 --> 36:54.360]  Let's get to the violence a year plus before.
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.760]  Number two, he renounces violence, and the five-between-good deal will play these clips
[36:58.760 --> 37:03.640]  in a moment, but people can say we know Roger's innocent, we know Roger didn't do anything.
[37:03.640 --> 37:04.800]  Let's move on.
[37:04.800 --> 37:11.280]  But the deep state is betting everything they've got right now on January 6th.
[37:11.280 --> 37:12.880]  What do you think they're really trying?
[37:12.880 --> 37:19.400]  Well, as you know, Alex, they've demonized me the way they've demonized you, and we're
[37:19.400 --> 37:21.800]  extremely polarizing figures.
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.800]  So they went around to various outlets, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington
[37:27.800 --> 37:33.400]  Post, and they said, we've got the goods on stone, shocking new evidence that he was at
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.400]  the centerpiece of the crime, probably the mastermind.
[37:36.400 --> 37:37.880]  We're going to reveal it at the hearing.
[37:37.880 --> 37:40.960]  He'll be arrested immediately after the hearing.
[37:40.960 --> 37:46.800]  My own lawyer is getting a call from CNN saying, so your client will be ameshed in the conspiracy
[37:46.800 --> 37:47.800]  today.
[37:47.800 --> 37:53.920]  We have no idea what they're talking about, because any claim that I knew in advance about
[37:53.920 --> 37:59.920]  was involved in or condoned any illegal action on January 6th is just false, and sorry, there
[37:59.920 --> 38:02.240]  is no evidence to the contrary.
[38:02.240 --> 38:06.960]  So we're scratching our heads, what could this possibly be?
[38:06.960 --> 38:09.880]  And then they have their phony baloney hearing.
[38:09.880 --> 38:15.080]  They show one completely falsified video, we'll show that in a little bit, just that's
[38:15.080 --> 38:18.440]  completely fabricated, just not true.
[38:18.440 --> 38:25.600]  They failed to show actual video of me renouncing violence, and then they just repeat the guilt
[38:25.600 --> 38:32.280]  by association, well, stone was seen with a proud boy, therefore, no, therefore nothing,
[38:32.280 --> 38:34.520]  that proves nothing.
[38:34.520 --> 38:41.360]  Joshua James, one of the oath keepers, was in stone sweep, they say, no, he delivered
[38:41.360 --> 38:43.760]  a suitcase to my room.
[38:43.760 --> 38:46.880]  James is a longtime associate of stones.
[38:46.880 --> 38:51.280]  I met this young guy on January 5th, never saw him again.
[38:51.280 --> 38:56.840]  He was charged with seditious conspiracy, he pled guilty, doesn't mean he told me what
[38:56.840 --> 39:04.200]  he was going to do on the 6th, I never saw him past the morning of the 6th when I elected
[39:04.200 --> 39:06.480]  not to go to the Capitol.
[39:06.480 --> 39:13.280]  So it's a nothing burger, it's guilt by association, but Alex, here's what they know, you can
[39:13.280 --> 39:20.480]  be sued, I can be sued, but they have congressional immunity, they can tell whatever whopper of
[39:20.480 --> 39:27.480]  a lie they want, but you can't bring a lawsuit against them, you can sue witnesses before
[39:27.480 --> 39:34.280]  their committee who don't tell the truth, that's why these two gay Danish documentary
[39:34.280 --> 39:39.640]  filmmakers who have leveled accusations against me, this is why they didn't testify live,
[39:39.640 --> 39:42.760]  because they would have been hit with a defamation suit like that.
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.440]  Now, I'm going to sue them anyway, because in various interviews they have said that
[39:47.440 --> 39:54.800]  I was, quote, at the heart of a criminal conspiracy, in the next breath they say they have no
[39:54.800 --> 39:56.920]  evidence of that even in their-
[39:56.920 --> 40:01.040]  Sure, so Roger, Roger, everyone knows that you didn't even weren't there on January 6th,
[40:01.040 --> 40:03.840]  you stayed in your hotel room because there was so many millions of people you couldn't
[40:03.840 --> 40:07.640]  get out your door, everybody knows you didn't do this, we know that, I know you can put
[40:07.640 --> 40:11.240]  the story out, explain the history, we all know it's true.
[40:11.240 --> 40:15.960]  My question to you as a top political analyst is, even Jen Psaki said last week they should
[40:15.960 --> 40:21.000]  stop betting everything on January 6th, the polls show people care way more about inflation
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.720]  or crime than that by order of magnitude, like 5% care about January 6th, 95% care about
[40:27.720 --> 40:34.760]  inflation, 90% care about open borders, so it's a dying issue for them, why are they
[40:34.760 --> 40:36.880]  obsessed with it?
[40:36.880 --> 40:43.760]  Because they have nothing else, they can't run on gas prices, they can't run on food
[40:43.760 --> 40:50.720]  shortages, they can't run on the open border policies that are causing a fentanyl epidemic
[40:50.720 --> 40:56.760]  and killing thousands of Americans every week, they can't run on the fact that they're shipping
[40:56.760 --> 41:03.560]  more and more and more billions to Ukraine when we have problems here in this country
[41:03.560 --> 41:10.920]  and they're walking us right to the brink of World War III, they can't run on the epic
[41:10.920 --> 41:18.600]  inflation, which shows that if you go to the grocery store, you can spend seven bucks on
[41:18.600 --> 41:25.440]  a steak and it's two and a half bites, they can't run on any of those issues, they have
[41:25.440 --> 41:30.160]  to obscure the fact that the President of the United States can't even string together
[41:30.160 --> 41:36.800]  a coherent sentence, they can't run on any of those things, so here's what this election
[41:36.800 --> 41:43.320]  needs to be about, Alex Jones, look at the coverage of your trial where you exercised
[41:43.320 --> 41:48.040]  your First Amendment right and you're being penalized to the tunes of a billion dollars
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.840]  because you exercised your right to express an opinion, which you have an absolute constitutional
[41:52.840 --> 41:53.840]  right to.
[41:53.840 --> 41:59.840]  I don't have to agree with you, people can find what you say offensive, but you still
[41:59.840 --> 42:00.840]  have a right to say.
[42:00.840 --> 42:04.320]  And it's all old, it's all out of context, they built this up.
[42:04.320 --> 42:12.840]  Right, and they wanted it to be about me because I'm a demon, I was pardoned for lying about
[42:12.840 --> 42:18.760]  Russian collusion, sorry folks, there was no Russian collusion to lie about, they wanted
[42:18.760 --> 42:24.080]  to be about the documents at Mar-a-Lago, Trump is hiding documents, what about the documents
[42:24.080 --> 42:30.240]  that Barack Obama has at a furniture warehouse in Chicago or the documents that George-
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.080]  And let's talk about that, the kangaroo January 6th is now subpoenaed Trump, that broke today,
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.600]  where you see all this going, got some clips of the so-called Danish film crew with a smoking
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.760]  gun a year before, you know, about the left being violent, remember the left was saying
[42:43.760 --> 42:47.400]  we're not going to accept the election, we're going to burn America down, civil war no matter
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.280]  what, and then you're talking about it, so you're the bad guy, Roger Stone's our guest
[42:51.280 --> 42:57.160]  and coming up, Adam Curry, David Ike and more, this is a big broadcast today in FullWars.com.

[43:04.920 --> 43:10.000]  but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel

[43:28.600 --> 43:33.840]  need to live and be healthy, essential means without these things you die, and so much
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.880]  of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster

[43:42.920 --> 43:47.440]  products out there, but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds

[46:09.320 --> 46:13.920]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[46:13.920 --> 46:19.040]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and
[46:19.040 --> 46:26.520]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[46:26.520 --> 46:30.040]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[46:30.040 --> 46:35.800]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[46:35.800 --> 46:40.280]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[46:40.280 --> 46:46.320]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.040]  and isn't going to give up, without your support we can be shut down.
[46:50.040 --> 47:01.160]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[47:01.160 --> 47:30.520]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.960]  Get him, he knows they're losing, they're throwing out all the stops now.
[47:34.960 --> 47:39.360]  Roger Stone is our guest, they're having wall to wall coverage on control TV that he's
[47:39.360 --> 47:43.200]  a mastermind of a planned overthrow of the government, steal the election, we know that's
[47:43.200 --> 47:45.080]  what they actually did.
[47:45.080 --> 47:50.320]  Roger, what does this signify at this point, the January 6th committee now trying to violate
[47:50.320 --> 47:57.240]  the separation of powers between the legislative executive judicial demanding Trump now testify
[47:57.240 --> 48:02.080]  or be subpoenaed for their kangaroo operation?
[48:02.080 --> 48:09.160]  That's an all in effort Alex to make this election about Trump, because by, that was
[48:09.160 --> 48:13.760]  their big take away, that was their big headline, they subpoena Donald Trump.
[48:13.760 --> 48:20.520]  I can't understand any circumstances under which that would happen, previous attempts
[48:20.520 --> 48:28.040]  by Congress to subpoena presidents have fallen entirely flat.
[48:28.040 --> 48:32.200]  What's amazing to me, and as a Texan you'll appreciate this, one of the things they said
[48:32.200 --> 48:40.000]  yesterday was, here's a video in which Roger Stone tells, says that if Trump loses, he
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.600]  should declare victory anyway.
[48:42.600 --> 48:49.400]  Where when I actually said was, if it's still up in the air, Trump should declare victory.
[48:49.400 --> 48:56.680]  This is precisely the advice that James A. Baker III, former Secretary of the Treasury
[48:56.680 --> 49:03.720]  gave George W. Bush in 2000, it is sound political and public relations advice, notice I didn't
[49:03.720 --> 49:10.960]  say if Trump loses, he should claim he won, I said if it's up in the air, he should declare
[49:10.960 --> 49:11.960]  victory.
[49:11.960 --> 49:16.520]  That shows that I'm smart, not dumb, but it certainly doesn't show that there was some
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.760]  premeditated plan to declare victory even if he did that.
[49:20.760 --> 49:24.200]  Well by the way, the Democrats from Pelosi, you name it, said no matter if Trump wins,
[49:24.200 --> 49:27.600]  we're not going to accept it, we're going to have our own inauguration of Biden.
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.960]  So they were all in the place saying they weren't going to accept it.
[49:31.960 --> 49:36.280]  Exactly right, but they erased that, look, Hillary Clinton and John Podesta actually
[49:36.280 --> 49:41.760]  tried to delay the certification of Trump's election in the Electoral College in 2016,
[49:41.760 --> 49:45.120]  along with 131 House Democrats.
[49:45.120 --> 49:50.360]  The Washington Post just tries to say that didn't happen, but of course it did happen.
[49:50.360 --> 49:57.280]  So yesterday was a cornucopia of completely fabricated videos, and then they failed to
[49:57.280 --> 50:05.240]  show the actual videos in which I stood in front of the US Supreme Court and I specifically
[50:05.240 --> 50:11.000]  told people don't be baited into violence, they had that video, why didn't they show
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  that video?
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.440]  I show trials, they show little 10, 15 second clips, let's play these clips, number one,
[50:16.440 --> 50:21.440]  two and three, back to back, you can respond, CNN, cut, let's get to the violence, number
[50:21.440 --> 50:24.800]  two, we renounce violence, they are the violent ones, they don't want you to see, number three,
[50:24.800 --> 50:26.800]  fight between good and evil, here's the three clips.
[50:26.800 --> 50:49.040]  We are committed to is the truth, to speak the truth, to fight the truth, to live for
[50:49.040 --> 51:00.440]  the truth, and the truth is Donald Trump won this election, tomorrow when the left tries
[51:00.440 --> 51:09.000]  to beat you, let's be very clear, we renounce violence, they are the violent ones.
[51:09.000 --> 51:17.400]  Let's be very clear, this is not an election between Republicans and Democrats, this is
[51:17.400 --> 51:24.520]  not a fight between liberals and conservatives, this is nothing less than an epic struggle
[51:24.520 --> 51:34.680]  for the future of this country between dark and light, between the godly and the godless,
[51:34.680 --> 51:42.960]  between good and evil, and we will win this fight or America will step off into a thousand
[51:42.960 --> 51:50.360]  years of darkness, we dare not fail.
[51:50.360 --> 51:56.240]  So that's what they've got on you, Roger, you're quite the villain.
[51:56.240 --> 52:01.000]  So Alex, in that first video, did you see me or see my mouth moving anyplace?
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.520]  No, in fact, we can play those short videos again, the best they've got is edited five
[52:05.520 --> 52:11.800]  second clips, but don't even show your face, you're saying these are fake clips?
[52:11.800 --> 52:20.080]  That's a fabrication, a week ago it had no visual, then in the version they showed at
[52:20.080 --> 52:27.600]  the hearing yesterday, they have showed visual of me wearing a mask, but the digital soundtrack
[52:27.600 --> 52:35.560]  is exactly the same, that's a fabrication, it's a complete fraud, and I'll prove that
[52:35.560 --> 52:42.400]  in federal court because I'm bringing a $25 million lawsuit against these two Foghazy
[52:42.400 --> 52:53.960]  Danish filmmakers, that is entirely fabricated, and they very cleverly put the visuals on
[52:53.960 --> 52:54.960]  there.
[52:54.960 --> 52:58.280]  So when a Democrat's calling for confronting people being violent, mostly peaceful, burned
[52:58.280 --> 53:04.280]  out cities, all this, they're good, and now they have five second clips of you just saying
[53:04.280 --> 53:07.360]  the violence or something, it's a joke.
[53:07.360 --> 53:11.640]  Which I will prove in the federal court is not even real.
[53:11.640 --> 53:17.880]  We've done the digital analysis, both soundtracks are the same audio, but they invented the
[53:17.880 --> 53:23.720]  second visual to try to tie me into, I'm wearing a mask, you can't see anyone's mouth
[53:23.720 --> 53:28.040]  moving, it's a fraud, it's just a completely fraud.
[53:28.040 --> 53:33.680]  I should say I am working on cleaning up my language, even if the F-bombs there I didn't
[53:33.680 --> 53:40.040]  really say, I really need to be somewhat more circumspect, I promise my wife and my pastor
[53:40.040 --> 53:41.040]  I will work on.
[53:41.040 --> 53:45.680]  But I mean, here are all these people constantly recording us and then putting out little snippets,
[53:45.680 --> 53:51.120]  in my show trials they play five second clips, and they know exactly what they're doing,
[53:51.120 --> 53:53.160]  so it's total desperateness.
[53:53.160 --> 53:59.760]  Yet, we saw Chuck Schumer threaten violence against the US Supreme Court, we've seen that
[53:59.760 --> 54:06.960]  video, but he won't be prosecuted, there's Maxine Waters, the multi-millionaire congresswoman
[54:06.960 --> 54:13.880]  who doesn't live in her district in California, she's advocates violence, you'll find no controversy.
[54:13.880 --> 54:17.920]  No, no, but I agree with you, they have nothing else but this, they keep pushing it, but even
[54:17.920 --> 54:22.600]  Saki said last week they should stop it, it's not working in the polls.
[54:22.600 --> 54:28.760]  There's no poll information, but I'm absolutely convinced this is why they have made the news
[54:28.760 --> 54:32.800]  regarding your trial has gotten such wall-to-wall coverage.
[54:32.800 --> 54:39.960]  They want this election to be about Donald Trump, or Alex Jones, or Roger Stone, or Documents
[54:39.960 --> 54:48.440]  at Mar-Lago, or January 6th, and you and I have both been demonized by an extraordinary
[54:48.440 --> 54:50.000]  hostile press.
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.600]  Thank God we have InfoWars as a beacon of freedom, as a platform for us to punch back
[54:56.600 --> 55:03.960]  or we'd have no place to mount our defense, not Twitter, not Facebook, not Instagram,
[55:03.960 --> 55:07.440]  so this is why InfoWars is so important.
[55:07.440 --> 55:12.520]  All right, Roger, well, I'm doing a special emergency broadcast tomorrow, we've got time
[55:12.520 --> 55:15.800]  tape with us, this is a live show right now, but we're gonna have tape tomorrow, I'm doing
[55:15.800 --> 55:20.920]  the nuclear war crisis, and the admitted COVID camps from other UN all over the world, they're
[55:20.920 --> 55:26.920]  planning during nuclear war to round us up all in, start airing tomorrow at 1 p.m. Central
[55:26.920 --> 55:32.280]  Standard Time, StoneDefenseFund.com, God bless you, Roger, be safe.
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.800]  Alex, absolutely, I would love to join you for tomorrow's broadcast, I am free.
[55:37.800 --> 55:42.480]  Folks go to StoneDefenseFund.com, it's not that I'm trying to make a profit, it's that
[55:42.480 --> 55:48.240]  I'm trying to defend myself, I have $100,000 in new legal bills just based on the false
[55:48.240 --> 55:55.240]  allegations made against me yesterday, but I will never stop fighting, and while you're
[55:55.240 --> 56:01.040]  at it, folks, go to the InfoWars store right now, buy a great product, or make a contribution,
[56:01.040 --> 56:07.880]  because InfoWars is the point of the spear, we are the tip of the spear, and if it weren't
[56:07.880 --> 56:12.920]  for a great platform like this, I wouldn't have any place that I can go to punch back
[56:12.920 --> 56:19.400]  at the CNN, MSNBC, Democrat fake news media cabal.
[56:19.400 --> 56:21.800]  Well, that's right, thank you, Roger, God bless you.
[56:21.800 --> 56:25.840]  They failed, they've collapsed, they're a joke, they know it, their number one mission
[56:25.840 --> 56:30.400]  is silence us at any cost, and folks, we don't want to complain, you don't know about one
[56:30.400 --> 56:34.360]  tenth of the attacks behind the scene, but I'm so excited, I'm so emboldened, I'm so
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.360]  empowered, I'm so buoyed right now, because I know humanity is waking up, thank you, Roger
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.800]  Stone, and we'll take 30 minutes commercial free with Roger tomorrow, I come in at 10
[56:44.800 --> 56:49.880]  a.m., and I've got a bunch of big guys, a bunch of big analysis, we'll have it all tomorrow
[56:49.880 --> 56:54.200]  airing at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[56:54.200 --> 56:59.440]  All right, we've got Adam Curry coming up to talk about the digital currency, the world
[56:59.440 --> 57:05.240]  government, how to stop it, and then David Eich coming up, and so much more here today,
[57:05.240 --> 57:09.760]  and yes, listeners, you can see work to quickening, we're the twelfth round of the fight, we're
[57:09.760 --> 57:14.480]  in the last inning of the baseball game, this is the most critical time to be informed,
[57:14.480 --> 57:19.040]  to be engaged, and to be involved that we've ever been, so all I ask is for your prayers
[57:19.040 --> 57:24.880]  that you share the live links to infowars.com and infowars.com for a slash show and band
[57:24.880 --> 57:30.000]  dot video, and that yes, if you want to get great products and fund the info war, get
[57:30.000 --> 57:37.320]  us on air, we have 1776 is the promo code, infowars.com, for additional 10% off on X3

[57:42.400 --> 57:43.400]  Fusion, infowars.com.
[57:43.400 --> 57:47.200]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone, we'll be right back with Adam Curry.
[57:47.200 --> 57:55.440]  I don't promote things unless they really work, when it comes to politics or culture,
[57:55.440 --> 58:00.040]  economics, we're always the cutting edge tip of the spear, and when we talk about the
[58:00.040 --> 58:05.080]  products at infowars.com, they all blow you away, it'll just take them, it'll just try
[58:05.080 --> 58:09.440]  them, I know you'll be, we'll be customers, and finally one of our best selling products
[58:09.440 --> 58:15.000]  sold out for months back in stock, it's X3, it's all three types of the very best atomic
[58:15.000 --> 58:21.520]  iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one,
[58:21.520 --> 58:22.520]  your immune system.
[58:22.520 --> 58:29.000]  So X3, despite the fact that it was around an iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right
[58:29.000 --> 58:35.160]  now at infowarsstore.com, and it funds the info war, which is a 360 win, if you've not
[58:35.160 --> 58:39.080]  experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick it on average, you've got
[58:39.080 --> 58:49.880]  to go to infowarsstore.com and get X3 50% off, X3 50% off infowarsstore.com, look it's not
[58:49.880 --> 58:54.880]  hyped that infowars has changed the world, it's not hyped that your support of infowars
[58:54.880 --> 58:58.840]  is the reason we were able to do this, so I salute you and I thank you.
[58:58.840 --> 59:03.920]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table, well high quality iodine
[59:03.920 --> 59:07.400]  is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride, and when you've got it in your
[59:07.400 --> 59:10.520]  body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves, it doesn't just give you more energy, it doesn't
[59:10.520 --> 59:16.360]  just boost your immune system, but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine,
[59:16.360 --> 59:18.200]  bromide, bromine family.
[59:18.200 --> 59:22.720]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average, take a
[59:22.720 --> 59:28.160]  few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results, plus it funds the info war,
[59:28.160 --> 59:32.480]  so what do you have to lose but taking action?
[59:32.480 --> 59:41.640]  Experience X3, finally back in stock at infowarsstore.com, right now for 50% off, experience tri-iodine,
[59:41.640 --> 59:46.000]  learn about the iodine fluoride conspiracy, learn how to counter the fluoride and fund
[59:46.000 --> 59:50.200]  the info war, and empower your life at infowarsstore.com.
[59:50.200 --> 1:00:20.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:24.000]  So the globalist, the Adam Curry, David Icon interviews are coming up here in the next
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:29.280]  segment, hit you with a bio weapon that gives you a heart attack, so microcarditis and blood
[1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:34.480]  clots, and don't worry, the CEO confirms new mRNA injection to repair heart muscles after
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:35.480]  heart attack.
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:39.280]  So they give you a heart attack, they give you the solution to it, and here's another
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:42.080]  headline of the LA Times.
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:48.400]  Why the war in Ukraine has countless different countries stockpiling iodine tablets.
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:52.680]  Why the war in Ukraine has countries stockpiling iodine tablets, because that protects you
[1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:56.080]  from some of the radioactive isotopes that are most common when a hydrogen bomb goes
[1:00:56.080 --> 1:00:57.080]  off.
[1:00:57.080 --> 1:01:01.160]  We don't sell X3 to protect you from radiation.
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:06.280]  We sell X3 because iodine that's true and pure and has all three good types is so amazing
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:12.680]  for your body, your energy, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, and yes, your thyroid.
[1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:13.680]  That's a game changer.
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:17.960]  But I told you a few weeks ago when it came back in, I said there's a huge run on X3,
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:21.400]  it's going to sell out soon, but despite that, it's 50% off.
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:25.240]  We can be sold out in a week at current sales rates, but I'm still keeping it 50% off because
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:28.600]  I want those that haven't experienced, it takes about two weeks to kick in, what it
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:32.920]  does for energy, stamina, libido, everything.
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:34.600]  But it's not 50% off right now.
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:35.600]  It was.
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:42.040]  It's 60% off with promo code 1776, 1776, and the enemy works around the clock to shut
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:45.920]  our money off and destroy us, but if I can celebrate product that empowers you and your
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:50.720]  body and your life force and your immune system and your energy and your stamina, then it's
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:51.720]  a win-win.

[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:05.640]  Their attacks haven't worked.
[1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:08.760]  Their criminal investigations haven't worked because we're so clean.
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:13.040]  They are in full panic mode and they want this broadcast off the air ahead of what they're
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:16.280]  about to launch election theft in 25 days.
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:18.880]  We are so close to winning a major battle.
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:24.640]  Obviously in the war is one yet, Christ will win that war, but God is watching us and wants
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:27.640]  to see what we are going to do in this fight.
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:32.920]  So I beyond salute, thank from the bottom of my heart, the listeners and viewers for keeping
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:38.680]  us in the fight and I encourage you now to take the articles and the videos, the most
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:42.520]  important information from infowars.com and share it and to tell folks about those local
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:47.040]  AM and FM stations, those old TV stations and to pray for a global awakening and to
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:53.520]  pray for peace and justice and for a stop to World War III and to then support infowars.com
[1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:56.280]  while getting products that will blow you away.

[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:21.080]  All right, we're going to go to break, we're going to come back with Adam Curry on the
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:25.400]  digital currency and New World Order and the David Ike scheduled to be coming up as well
[1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:29.560]  in the nature of reality, how to break free from the matrix, want to salute and thank
[1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:30.560]  this crew as well.
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:39.360]  We're doing a kick-ass job and then tomorrow, 1pm central, I'm going to tape a special
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:45.880]  show, tomorrow I'll tape it, a special broadcast to air at 1pm central and the real magic is
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:50.160]  when you take it and share it, I salute you, you really are the tip of the spear, you are
[1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:59.880]  the resistance, we are a family, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:04.560]  This is our best seller, we first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:09.440]  seller, but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made it
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:14.440]  feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:17.440]  and it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:22.880]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system but it helps every cellular
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:27.840]  function of the body and has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential
[1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:31.240]  vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:35.680]  Essential means without these things you die and so much of the food is debased, there's
[1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:40.520]  so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with
[1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:41.520]  a product like this.
[1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:45.040]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there but this is amongst the
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:49.560]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the info work so the only way you lose is
[1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:55.000]  not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at infoworkstore.com
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:59.600]  for 50% off, vitamin mineral fusion back in stock at infoworkstore.com.
[1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:09.600]  Again, I know we have record numbers of new listeners and viewers tuning in to the forbidden
[1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:10.600]  broadcast.
[1:06:10.600 --> 1:06:16.520]  We're now to the hour number two on this Friday, October 14th, 2022 transmission.
[1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:23.520]  Tomorrow, I'm going to be up here at 10 a.m. and I'm going to tape till past noon or so
[1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:26.680]  and then we'll start streaming it by I would guess one o'clock and then post it to Band
[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:27.680]  Up video.
[1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:33.800]  I'm going to do a two hour commercial free emergency broadcast on the threat of nuclear
[1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:41.800]  war and also how governments under UN control have built under the guise of COVID camps,
[1:06:41.800 --> 1:06:45.720]  relocation, political prisoner camps and their admissions of that.
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:50.200]  So tomorrow, commercial free because I want to be able to roll all this out, play all
[1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:55.800]  the clips, show the documents over the evidence, I'm going to blow everybody away and break
[1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:59.200]  some of the biggest news ever.
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:06.120]  And again, we'll start taping at about 10.30 or so, we'll be done in two hours.
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:08.920]  It'll start streaming at one o'clock, two o'clock tomorrow, not sure when, we'll add
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:12.080]  a lot of documents and information to it.
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:18.360]  So look for that tomorrow, Saturday, the 15th of October, we're about to go to Adam Curry,
[1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:24.840]  the inventor of podcasting, famous talk show host in his own right on the casual society,
[1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:29.160]  on the new world order, on what PayPal is doing and how it's the model of the social
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:31.000]  credit score and so much more.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:37.640]  And then a huge interview that we taped a few weeks ago that we're going to premiere
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:42.600]  here live on air with David Eich that is super in depth and extremely powerful about the
[1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:44.640]  nature of reality.
[1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:47.320]  So that's all coming up and so much more.
[1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:49.600]  Because remember, only way we stay on air is your support.
[1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:54.200]  I salute you for your support, additional 10% off of the big mega sale right now at

[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:03.960]  on so much more.
[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:08.080]  And again, that's how we stay on air, that's how we battle these people, they've been lying
[1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:11.680]  and saying we're going away, we're bankrupt, we've got to pay a million dollars.
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:16.720]  None of that's true, two men can't have a baby, this is all a fraud, they can't silence
[1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:20.200]  us, they can't take us off air unless they kill me or put me in prison, what you're trying
[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:21.200]  to do.
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:26.440]  So as long as you support and get great products at the same time and spread the word, infowars.com,
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:31.760]  this broadcast, Owen Schreuer, Harrison Smith, all the rest of the great crew, Gregory Shunamit
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:34.560]  will still be battling and we're all in this together.

[1:09:37.160 --> 1:10:03.560]  here on air and then David Eich is coming up and so much more, please stay with us.
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:14.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this emergency Saturday broadcast.
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:22.080]  When I say emergency, you see we are in a growing, intensifying emergency.
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:30.560]  Geopolitically, war, proxy wars, destabilized borders, collapsing currencies, the list goes
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:31.560]  on and on.
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:37.480]  And you have Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum admitting, out of these global crises,
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:42.280]  they are bringing in their great reset and their new world order agenda 2030.
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:45.160]  So we're going to be looking at Russia.
[1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:50.400]  I told you two weeks ago, look for a massive, massive escalation.
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:55.880]  Now the pipelines are both been one blown up, one damaged, Nord Stream one and two.
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:59.000]  Now they're talking about other pipelines are probably going to get destroyed.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  We've got other European pipelines turning on the same day that Nord Stream was blown
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:04.320]  up.
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:08.280]  You have Russia threatening nuclear war, Putin saying he's not bluffing.
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:12.480]  And in the background of this, we have the private Federal Reserve, we have the head
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:17.720]  of the European Union, all the big banking heads saying that they're soon going to roll
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:21.160]  out these digital programmable currencies.
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:27.800]  I was driving down the highway the other morning and I was flipping through the AM dial and
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:32.280]  came across 1200 OAI and I heard a voice I recognized.
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:36.040]  And then I drove under and overpassed as they were going to break and I didn't hear who
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:37.040]  he was talking to.
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:38.540]  But I said, I know this guy.
[1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:39.540]  This guy is so smart.
[1:11:39.540 --> 1:11:40.540]  I got to get him on.
[1:11:40.540 --> 1:11:41.540]  Who is it?
[1:11:41.540 --> 1:11:43.080]  They come back, do another segment.
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:44.240]  It's Adam Curry.
[1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:46.440]  And I'm like, oh my gosh, I got to beg Adam to come on.
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:47.440]  He's such a busy guy.
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:51.720]  He is credited as being the creator or the first podcaster.
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:55.880]  He's also a super smart guy and of course well known for being the number one host when
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:12:00.000]  they kicked off MTV back when it was the biggest thing in the world.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:07.360]  And he joins us now for a 50 minute transmission, no agenda show dot com to get into the entire
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:08.440]  waterfront.
[1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:11.800]  And you know, if you think I interrupt, Glenn Beck, I think he's a great guy overall.
[1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:12.800]  He was really interrupting.
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:16.240]  But he was raising a lot of great points, but I wanted to get Adam on.
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:21.280]  This was the Thursday I was listening and here he is with a Saturday to just have the floor
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:26.400]  and really be able to walk through all this because Adam obviously has an amazing background
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:27.400]  as well.
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:32.480]  He had a family very close to him that was a CIA section chief, so he has a whole background
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.920]  really growing up of understanding how the world really works.
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:40.640]  And he's here with us to cover the midterms, January 6, the whole waterfront.
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:41.640]  Adam, great to have you.
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:42.640]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:43.640]  Yeah, sure.
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:45.880]  It's always good to see you, man.
[1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:46.880]  Where do you want to start?
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:49.600]  Because I'm going to try to just shut up and let you roll because the way you laid out
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.520]  the digital currencies, the way you lay out everything, I mean, I listen to the show routinely,
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:58.080]  but the way you laid it out on Glenn Beck was amazing and I wanted to give you more time.
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:02.040]  Yeah, and I'm not a financial guy, obviously.
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:07.800]  I would say because of my interest in Bitcoin is kind of how I learn more and more about
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:09.720]  the financial system.
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:11.920]  And this goes back to Ron Paul's and the Fed.
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:15.440]  That's where I really start to understand what the Federal Reserve does.
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:20.080]  And that's now, what is it, 15 years, been quite a while since that book.
[1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:25.120]  But what I'm seeing, Alex, is the way it's presented in the media, what's going on right
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:27.560]  now, it's upside down.
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:35.080]  What we continuously hear is because of Putin, because of the war in Ukraine, because of
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:39.840]  COVID, these are all the reasons that the financial system is in turmoil, but that's
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:41.160]  upside down.
[1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:46.080]  We have all of these things happening because of the financial system, and that's the part
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:53.160]  that frustrates me when I see how it's reported is all of this, all problems stem from the
[1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:59.360]  financial system as it is kind of, I mean, it seems like it's coming to its end, this
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:00.520]  version of the system.
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:05.560]  And we've had many versions of financial systems for the United States dollar.
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:10.120]  We were at one point on the gold standard in the 70s, we were taken off the gold standard.
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:14.480]  And if you think the government won't mess with your money, I mean, there was an actual
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:19.880]  gold confiscation, it was illegal to have gold or gold coins, you had to give it up,
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:23.600]  so anything can change ultimately.
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:30.840]  But now we're in a world where I think, unfortunately, the money creation has just gotten out of
[1:14:30.840 --> 1:14:39.640]  control, and that is truly the parameters for inflation are money creation and something
[1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:41.240]  called the velocity of money.
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:47.520]  So how fast people are spending money that they get into their hands, that has been bastardized
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:54.960]  and turned into something called the consumer price index, and it only looks at the cost
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:58.120]  of gas and the cost of food.
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:04.960]  But really, that's not what the problem is, and of all the US dollars ever created, ever
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:12.720]  brought into existence, ever, since the beginning, 40% was created in the last two years.
[1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:17.680]  So when you have, and this is something that I did learn in high school, and I think everyone
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:24.860]  kind of agrees, if you have X amount of money and X amount of goods, there's price discovery.
[1:15:24.860 --> 1:15:30.240]  If everybody has a lot more money, then the prices will have to change.
[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:32.920]  So it's the supply and demand.
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:39.560]  And we just got into this perfect situation, which now, in my opinion, is just being exasperated
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.920]  and to just to prove that it's a financial issue.
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:47.360]  The first thing that they did as this started, well, in my opinion, we probably shut down
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:55.280]  the economy as the first way to stop the bleeding since hyperinflation can actually happen.
[1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:58.640]  And that was probably the main reason behind the...
[1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:04.720]  I don't promote things unless they really work, when it comes to politics or culture,
[1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:08.160]  economics, we are always the cutting edge in the tip of the spear.
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:12.160]  And when we talk about the products in infomercial.com, they all blow you away.
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:16.360]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be, we'll be customers.
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:21.240]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back in stock, it's X3.
[1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:27.720]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,
[1:16:27.720 --> 1:16:31.880]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:38.320]  So X3, despite the fact that it was running iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:44.120]  now at infowarstore.com, and it funds the Info War, which is a 360 win.
[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:48.200]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, takes two weeks to kick it on average, you've
[1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:59.000]  got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off, X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:03.640]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents, from their own
[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:09.440]  admissions is now happening, Info Wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:14.840]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:20.400]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most
[1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:23.720]  critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:28.800]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:32.720]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:38.240]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:39.520]  It's unsustainable.
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:43.960]  So please visit saveinfowars.com.

[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:10.720]  media.
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:11.720]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:16.440]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:19.840]  and kept Info Wars and Free Speech on the air, and I thank you.
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:24.240]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them, and
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:25.240]  I need your support.
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:29.960]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:34.960]  against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com.

[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:50.760]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:54.400]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom

[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:03.760]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:08.240]  on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:11.360]  their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:14.560]  Well it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:19.280]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:23.240]  don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:25.320]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:31.720]  I don't play any Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from infowars.com,
[1:19:31.720 --> 1:19:35.040]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:40.200]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible and despite the
[1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:46.520]  fact that it's selling out, X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:49.160]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:50.160]  We're not selling it for that.
[1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:53.880]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:59.720]  Get X3 today, 50% off at infowarsstore.com all supplies last.
[1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:26.120]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:38.040]  Now we come out of this and there's no way to stop it.
[1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:41.120]  You can't get it under control.
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:47.960]  So we have to be able to control the money at a more granular level and that is why you
[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:53.920]  hear all this talk of the CBDC or the central bank digital currency because they'll tackle
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:21:01.120]  the problem from the opposite end, whereas now they can really create and destroy dollars
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:06.320]  to manage inflation and thus somehow the economy and the prices.
[1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:10.720]  They want to now, in essence, have control over your money so they can remove money
[1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:13.320]  from you, small increments, you won't know it.
[1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:19.480]  Or when they put money in, they can basically determine where it's going to be spent.
[1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:23.120]  And we'll have to get into the details.
[1:21:23.120 --> 1:21:31.440]  This all comes back in my mind to this drive towards the green carbon neutral or net neutral
[1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:38.960]  economy that is now, and all the actions in the European Union, they're ahead of us right
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:39.960]  now.
[1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:43.040]  They are reigniting their carbon markets.
[1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:49.880]  So the basic concept is your money will be controlled based upon your carbon footprint.
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:57.760]  So you will be given personal responsibility to do the right thing if you want to access
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:03.400]  your money in the way that the government now, in fact, intends.
[1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:09.640]  And it sounds really far out there and I don't know about you, Alex, but every single time
[1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:13.240]  I look at something and say, crap, they're doing this like vaccines, you know, all these
[1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:16.600]  things, it kind of comes into play 10 years later.
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:21.760]  So I don't know if this is going to happen in 10 years, Powell, the chairman of the Fed,
[1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:26.040]  he said, well, you know, central bank digital currency, we're looking at it probably three
[1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:27.280]  years away.
[1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:31.680]  But Christine Lagarde, who was the Powell of the European central bank, she made it sound
[1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:36.720]  recently at Atlantic Council interview, like it was kind of happening.
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:44.480]  And what was creepy there is she said, the way they're pitching this is credit cards
[1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:47.360]  track you.
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:53.320]  Credit cards build a profile of you and these are exploited commercially to sell things
[1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:55.280]  to you and know what you're doing.
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:22:59.360]  And she says our central bank digital currency, it won't do that.
[1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:03.560]  It will and not that they won't be tracking and building a profile of you, but they won't
[1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:05.800]  sell it to commercial companies.
[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:07.960]  But the government could do a heck of a lot with that.
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:14.240]  So this digital twin profile, they want to build that and they want to know who you are
[1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:18.200]  and subsequently how to control you.
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:21.880]  And you walked through that when I heard you on the radio the other day and you made the
[1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:24.000]  point, this is not your opinion.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:28.040]  This is not something that's just we're surmising they could do this.
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:33.880]  They're saying in these IMF World Bank Federal Reserve and also BlackRock statements that
[1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:39.360]  also what the Bank of England came out about a month ago, two months ago and said, oh, we're
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:43.400]  going to program the tokens and we're going to program these new digital systems and we'll
[1:23:43.400 --> 1:23:47.440]  decide when you can spend it, how you can spend it, we'll put it in your account and
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:48.920]  then maybe it has two days.
[1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:54.320]  That way we can have stimulus or we can take some of the value out of if we want to slow
[1:23:54.320 --> 1:23:55.320]  things down.
[1:23:55.320 --> 1:24:00.920]  I mean, this is total surveillance, total control and you bring in the SEGs with all
[1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:06.080]  these big private corporations and banks and BlackRock and then central banks admitting
[1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:09.720]  that they're also going to tell you where you can spend it and how you can spend it
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:14.240]  quote for the environment, but really it's to send the money right back to themselves.
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:21.320]  Oh, absolutely, yes, the environmental, social governance regulations that kind of came out
[1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:22.320]  of nowhere.
[1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:27.080]  I think, you know, I really start tuning into it about a year ago is like, wow, this thing
[1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:28.080]  is real.
[1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:33.880]  They in essence made their own ranking system and their own little way of determining if
[1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:37.720]  you as a company are good at environmental goals.
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:44.200]  If you're good at social goals, which would be your woke culture and governance, which
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:50.160]  is also a part of that, making sure you have equity everywhere and so they make up their
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:59.000]  own rules and determine what is environmentally or socially or what is friendly and since
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:04.680]  they make the rules, they can in essence determine who's going to get investments or not because
[1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:09.880]  when you look at the true investment market out in Wall Street, it's pension funds.
[1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:14.640]  These are the biggest ones, pension funds, retirement funds, and they're the ones that
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:19.000]  are then making these decisions and if the so-called rules which just kind of came into
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:25.120]  existence like many other rules in our country say, well, you know, you can't invest in fracking
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:29.320]  or you can't invest in pipelines or anything of this nature, then that investment won't
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:31.000]  go in there.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:38.960]  And to me, it feels also like there's a lot of subplots here as right now Europe is and
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:44.840]  I have a lot of friends who live there is really, it's chaos.
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:49.240]  People's energy bills just for electricity have doubled in Germany that are close to
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:52.520]  quadrupling in the UK as well.
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:57.000]  This gets people's attention and so they're focused on, oh, it's because of Ukraine, it's
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:01.840]  because of Putin, they throw all that out there, but really it's your fault because
[1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:07.880]  we shouldn't be using these horrible things to heat our home or to cook with.
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:12.480]  But at the same time, the solutions they have which is wind and solar aren't sufficient,
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:15.000]  may never be sufficient, and so they're not working.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  So now there's this push and they're going to do everything to shame us into it being
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:21.960]  our fault.
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:26.000]  And I think it's working and you see people are just zombifying, they're starting to
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:32.440]  shut down, okay, whatever you say, we'll just do it, we'll go along with it.
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.880]  And that's when you introduce your carbon footprint and this is where it's going to
[1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:39.320]  get interesting.
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:44.200]  Just listen to what they're saying, meat is bad because of methane that is emitted from
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:46.640]  cow farts and burps.
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:50.920]  So if you're eating meat, they're going to calculate your portion of the fart, your
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:56.160]  portion of the burp and how much greenhouse gas that is and that's going to be marked
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:27:01.200]  up somewhere on your chart which will be directly calculable against what you can or can't
[1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:02.200]  do without your money.
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:07.240]  And it doesn't, I mean, it sounds futuristic, but China of course already does this to a
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:12.120]  certain degree with WeChat and that's what the kind of platform is there.
[1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:20.200]  And you know, when I think about the government being stupid and being backwards and the
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:25.720]  true meaning of the term retarded, they actually are backwards, it's not really true.
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:30.880]  I think that you look at DARPA and these guys, you know, they were testing the effects of
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:33.280]  social networking in the 70s.
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:36.800]  So when it comes to a central bank digital currency, I have a feeling they have a lot
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:41.720]  more knowledge and have been working on this for a long time and there's been tons of rumors
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:47.800]  about different types of financial systems, different altcoins that were supposed to,
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:52.480]  you know, like XRP or Ripple that was supposed to be this backbone and all of that seems
[1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:55.920]  unlikely but it seems very likely they do have a plan and they've probably had that
[1:27:55.920 --> 1:27:57.280]  for a long time.
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:05.360]  The question is, what event will we need to bring this into play and we're seeing events
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:06.360]  daily now.
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:07.360]  I mean, this is fantastic.
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:13.680]  I mean, the most shocking one was the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines.
[1:28:13.680 --> 1:28:14.680]  That's a big deal.
[1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:20.360]  We'll have its own Wikipedia page in the future.
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:23.360]  It's really just stunning to be at this moment.
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:26.680]  Adam Curry is our guest here and I'm just sitting back thinking about this.
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:29.280]  Let's just talk about food for a moment.
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:36.880]  You have a massive global inflation after all the stimulus, not just by the U.S. but
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:41.720]  dozens of other major nations that did it, hundreds of smaller countries.
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:45.520]  You have people paid for several years in the third world, that is, the governments
[1:28:45.520 --> 1:28:50.120]  were paid IMF and World Bank money to just shut down their economies that's now caused
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:55.680]  mass formation and collapsed the third world, now flooding via the U.N. Refugee Centers
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:58.640]  into Europe and into the U.S. and...
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:01.160]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:07.960]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we're always cutting edge to the tip of the
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:12.160]  iceberg, and when we talk about the products at infomerstore.com, they all blow you away.

[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:09.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made it feel and
[1:30:09.440 --> 1:30:13.280]  how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.

[1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:34.440]  And so much of the food is debased.
[1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:39.600]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses

[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:10.600]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:22.080]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:27.240]  The Canada North America, and then you have in the Netherlands and many other places like
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:32.120]  Australia, ordering people to get rid of a certain amount of their sheep and cows by
[1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:37.240]  2030, they want it to be 90% of them, that's why the farmers are obviously protesting.
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:41.720]  You have the fertilizer prices exploding, and you look at these numbers, the UN World
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:47.440]  Food Chief just said last week, this is going to be hell on earth, hundreds of millions
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:53.200]  can starve to death, probably will, we already know in the last few years of lockdown that
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:58.120]  tens of millions extra starve to death, they are deliberately cutting off the industrial
[1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:00.160]  base of the planet.
[1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:03.720]  Yes, and they have a plan for this.
[1:34:03.720 --> 1:34:08.440]  A couple years ago, I met a guy called Texas Slim, who was starting something called the
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:14.680]  beef initiative, beefinitiative.com, and it was really interesting, he says, Adam, you
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:18.840]  have to understand, we need some real food intelligence, like food intelligence, what
[1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:19.840]  are you talking about?
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:27.800]  And as he kind of lifted the veil for me, in 2018, the final consolidation of big ag
[1:34:27.800 --> 1:34:32.640]  and pharmaceuticals, we had bear in Monsanto and all these big mega mergers, that was kind
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:37.400]  of when everyone decided, when those guys decided, here we go, we're moving towards
[1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:45.880]  new food, and this of course is not going to unnoticed, the idea is, since meat is bad
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:51.040]  for you and bad for the environment, and the siop is also that it's been bad for you,
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:56.880]  this has been something that's been jammed into people's heads for many, many decades,
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:01.720]  you are going to eat meat alternatives, and you need your protein, so it will be soy,
[1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:08.040]  plant based products, as well as insects for protein, and that's already kind of slipping
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:09.040]  in.
[1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:14.560]  And in a way, you get Nicole Kidman eating some bugs on camera, part of the obvious promotion,
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:19.080]  but really they've already slipped it in, it has different names, cricket powders in
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:26.200]  all kinds of flour products already, but what is interesting is, particularly in the United
[1:35:26.200 --> 1:35:33.680]  States, the food industry, when it comes to animal protein, it's a cartel of four major
[1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:42.960]  food processors, so it's JBS, it's Cargill, it's two others, and ranchers and farmers,
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:47.640]  let's just talk about ranchers for a second, have been really removed from the consumer,
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:53.680]  so it's almost like commodity cowboys, where we raise our cattle and then whenever the
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:58.080]  processing plant says we can take them, whether they're ready or not, whether they could grow
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:04.600]  more, they go, it's completely out of the ranchers' hands at this point, then the processing
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:08.800]  takes place, and what's interesting in Texas, most of our Texas beef, that's not what's
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:14.440]  in HEB, that's not in our local supermarket chain, that's sold off very high prices to
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:18.920]  restaurants and countries all over the world, where the elites eat our beef, and what we're
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:24.680]  getting is cattle that's been, either it's been processed and slaughtered in Australia,
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:30.120]  and it's been frozen, it's been in transit for a while, and who knows what inputs are
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:35.320]  going into that before it finally reaches your kitchen, or we're getting it from the
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:40.480]  cattle drive from South America, which includes, I think, 10 different touch points of the
[1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:44.800]  cattle before they're finally up here and taken to slaughter, so we're not really getting
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:45.800]  the clue.
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:49.360]  That was the famous joke with McDonald's even in the 80s, it was a big investigation, the
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:53.840]  burgers would say all American beef on the wrapper, well all American, Brazilian and
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:55.600]  Argentinian beef.
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:01.240]  Correct, correct, and just because it says USDA, I mean it's all lies, all the packaging,
[1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:07.960]  it's all meant to obfuscate the truth, so the bottom line is, as Americans, we're not
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:13.280]  eating food, we really are not eating food, and we don't know it because it all looks
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:17.480]  good and it tastes good, you know, you used to hear, oh processed foods, that's bad for
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:22.800]  you, yeah, it's not even food, I didn't really realize it myself to be honest, but then when
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:30.040]  you start consuming real beef, you can get it directly from a rancher, which is what the
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:34.200]  beef initiative is trying to do, to connect consumers to ranchers again and create this
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:39.440]  parallel economy, that's the only way out because the plan, and it's also, it's not
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:45.240]  hidden, the plan is less actual animal protein, more synthetics.
[1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:48.960]  Let me just back you up on this, just a few weeks ago there were a bunch of articles from
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:55.760]  the WEF from Bill Gates saying to fight climate change, we need ultra processed food and then
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:38:01.680]  the FDA came out a few months ago and said we're not going to even regulate nanotech
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:06.840]  in food, that was a finding where we just don't have a jurisdiction, so this is really
[1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:12.000]  a transhumanist revolution, you got Gates, the biggest private farm owner in the United
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:17.320]  States, talking about his magic GMO seeds, I mean this really is a corporate takeover
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:21.320]  of the entire infrastructure, can you elaborate on your in-depth research and perspective
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:22.720]  on that Adam Curry?
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:28.560]  Yeah, I would say, here's an interesting one, you mentioned the Netherlands and the farmers,
[1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:32.640]  well I grew up in the Netherlands, I moved there from the States when I was seven and
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:37.960]  actually went through the Dutch schooling system and been there for quite a while and
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:42.520]  know a lot about it, and also know a lot of the farmers and everything you've heard is
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:50.640]  absolutely true, the whole idea of this net zero is to create this huge city which would
[1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:57.440]  consist of the Netherlands, the Benelux, essentially Belgium, I think they'll add a piece of Germany
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:02.120]  to that and that'll be this big bedroom community where everybody I guess goes to work or they
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:06.880]  zoom in to work and all the farm production is supposed to diminish, that's where you
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:10.640]  need that for housing, it's a very small country, it's the size of Rhode Island, they have
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:16.880]  17 million people living there, but what was surprising since they are very famous and
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:24.960]  very big in their animal and other farm exports is that this company that I grew up with called
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:31.760]  Royal DSM, Royal DSM was a Royal because of the Dutch Royal Family's investment like
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:40.400]  Royal Dutch Shell, DSM was a chemical company, it was a chemical, yeah, big chemical processing
[1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:47.600]  company and I woke up one day and I looked around, I'm reading about food and processing
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:52.120]  stuff and I see DSM acquired some company and go take a look, these guys have completely
[1:39:52.120 --> 1:40:00.000]  transformed, now with 8 billion euros in revenue every year, they are the largest supplier
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:10.880]  to the world of processed food, i.e. bugs, soy and plants of taste and texture products
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:18.840]  and that's it, that's the key there is it tastes good, it tastes right, it feels right,
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:23.920]  we don't care, as Americans we really are not good at recognizing food and it's hard
[1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:28.800]  because they are really making this stuff look and taste the way it should and even
[1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:32.480]  the way it's not even natural, they do lots of tests to make sure that you're going to
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:40.400]  like it and this is what's made us sick and I look at the statistics, 47% of all children
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:50.560]  in America are at least pre-diabetic, I mean that's a genocide, absolutely and part of
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:56.480]  this stems from and the same people around from climate change, it all goes back to the
[1:40:56.480 --> 1:41:01.600]  population bomb and Dvorak and I talk about this all the time on the show, in the 70s
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:06.240]  there was a book that came out and everyone was freaking out and this is likely the genesis
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:11.440]  of the Georgia guide stones as we need less people on the planet, how are we going to
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:12.440]  do that?
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:18.040]  I mean the eugenics movement in the United States which is rarely discussed but man Hitler
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:23.280]  was writing fan letters to the people who were involved in that, it's very embarrassing
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:30.280]  and very little known about how, we had beautiful baby contest at state fairs to show hey look
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:37.600]  at this is my perfect baby and after you look at some of these less perfect human beings
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:39.000]  we got to get rid of them.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:44.680]  Well to be clear, Hitler got eugenics from the UK and the United States, so Adam Curry,
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:50.280]  big picture here, the globalists want to scientifically control all of human aspects,
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:54.800]  they said they're building a transhumanist post human world, how do all these factors
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:58.720]  come together and where do you think from their own admissions they're trying to take
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:05.080]  us and how is their operation to get us there going, if this was a football game, pro freedom
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:11.360]  folks versus the technocracy, team freedom versus team demon, how's humanity doing right
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:12.360]  now?
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:19.680]  How's humanity, well humanity is not licked by a long shot, they wouldn't have to put
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:25.240]  so much into propagandizing us if they had it all figured out, in fact it's really not
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:28.920]  a football game, I don't think there's any finesse to it, they're going with sledge hammers
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:32.000]  and the sledge hammers are money and food, that's all.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:37.560]  I agree, it is just brute force controlling the infrastructure attack and the solution
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:43.960]  is we already see it happening, 100 years ago 90% of people were rural, 10% were urban,
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:48.760]  you know today 90% are urban, 10% are rural but we're seeing a mass exodus back to the
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:53.360]  country and people rediscovering local communities, the UN talks about sustainability but what
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.680]  they're pushing is the opposite, we need real sustainability, that means local community.
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:03.760]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the globalist documents from their own admissions
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:09.200]  is now happening, infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:14.480]  because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:20.120]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:26.840]  critical juncture in the fight together, so I want to ask all of you today to help keep
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:32.000]  me on the air, in my decades on air I've never asked for personal donations but I'm being
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:36.680]  forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:43.680]  myself, it's unsustainable, so please visit, saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com,
[1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:49.040]  saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:53.800]  can so that I can continue to persevere, I'll never give up, I'll never give in but I could
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:59.720]  give out, thank you for your support, wouldn't be here without you, saveinfowars.com.
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:07.120]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist, I have come from nowhere to
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:13.040]  the very heights of politics not just in America but the world, we are engaging the globalist
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:18.440]  at point-blank range in the information war but I don't deserve the credit, yes I've
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:23.480]  persevered but the listeners and viewers who support infowars are the real reason we've
[1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:29.200]  had this success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:36.640]  we've ever had, we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today
[1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:40.160]  it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:45.320]  to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify it, God bless you all,

[1:44:50.760 --> 1:44:55.600]  are over the target and this dream is happening, the fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:44:58.720]  our fight, God bless you all.
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:02.800]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny but when you fight tyranny
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:08.040]  the new world order comes after you, now I knew that and for 28 years I've been on air
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:12.520]  exposing these people and together we've had a great effect but listen, they're coming

[1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:19.360]  body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells, it doesn't just give you more energy, it doesn't
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:25.120]  just boost your immune system but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride chlorine
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:27.000]  bromide bromine family.

[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:13.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:29.960]  I see only way to go and you know all of our problems stem from this, like our education
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:35.120]  system and I'll take some blame for that because in the 80s and 90s when we were coming up
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:41.720]  and I'm now 58, you know party time, making a career, having a good time, I was in New
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:49.880]  York, it was fantastic, school board, it's clearly some loser who couldn't get a better
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:55.560]  gig there on the school board, it's the local city council, whatever, so we weren't paying
[1:47:55.560 --> 1:48:00.960]  attention and that's where a lot of problems crept in, so that has to be dealt with locally
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:08.040]  but before that, and I know it sounds like doomsday but it's important that you find
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:15.120]  a rancher or whether it's beef or hog or chickens and farmers, although I think you
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:19.080]  can probably get away with just animal protein if it really gets bad, you need to go shake
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:25.240]  their hand, go find out how they operate, will they sell directly to you, these are
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:32.480]  things you just need to do for your family, it's not enough to have rice and whatever
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:39.360]  else people are storing, you really need to have access in my opinion to animal protein,
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:45.160]  good, pure animal protein which really starts with the source which is the seed and so the
[1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:51.680]  farmers and the ranchers that are clued into this, they don't have Monsanto grass and not
[1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:58.880]  only that but they're here in Texas, they're starting to go back to their old processes
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:02.280]  that they learned from their grandparents, and by the way for folks that don't know every
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:07.120]  ancient culture whether it was the Hindus 3,000 plus years ago or the Jews 3,000 plus
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:11.520]  years ago, when you read the Vedic text for the Old Testament, it's God then made the
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:17.920]  grass for the cows to eat and that gave us the wealth and then Moses says in Exodus stop
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:22.400]  worshiping the golden calf because that's what they were worshiping but people know
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:27.520]  beef and the protein and what it does when it's not been burned makes us stronger, makes
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:31.800]  our hearts better, our brains better, humans have basically developed into what we are
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:36.680]  with bigger heads, larger brains, healthier, longer lived because we went from being mainly
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:41.880]  a herbivore to a nondivore to a carnivore and that's in all the real science studies
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:47.720]  they know it and you take away red meat, clean healthy red meat from people, you literally
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:52.680]  emasculate them, you dumb them down, lower IQs and children, everything, we are a transitional
[1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:57.080]  species going carnivorous and they're trying to take us out of that because it has immediate
[1:49:57.080 --> 1:50:00.360]  effects from just mainline research, can you elaborate on that?
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:05.840]  Well, I agree with that and I think it was, I think it was Jordan Peterson who said that
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:11.040]  once we discovered fire and we were cooking our meat, our belly shrank and our heads grew
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:18.720]  and by the way, I've been looking for this study and I haven't found it, it seems to
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:23.400]  have disappeared but at the time when I saw it it looked like it was pretty legit, a study
[1:50:23.400 --> 1:50:27.000]  in Japan about something called soy rage.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:32.920]  If you're not feeding good healthy protein to your children's brains, weird stuff can
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:41.040]  start to happen and now we have to get into the medication of our children which is so
[1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:48.680]  flabbergasting how quickly this went from some Ritalin 20 years ago to now Adderall
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:58.320]  of Ivans, these are just standard things that kids trade in the schoolyard.
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:07.240]  The percentage of children on anti-anxiety medication is astounding and so I'm not quite
[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.760]  sure what we do with the current generation.
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:13.920]  Absolutely, let me just pause you there, let me just interrupt the famous Alex Jones interruption,
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:17.280]  Adam Curry kicking ass here with us today, really appreciate you joining us on this Saturday
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:19.800]  morning and we're going to air this later in the day and then later this week we're
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:21.880]  going to air it on the main show.
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:25.960]  Let's get into the medications but when you mentioned the soy study, there's actually
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:31.640]  one out of Italy, there's one out of Canada, there's a big one out of Japan you just mentioned,
[1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:37.200]  we actually just found it, we'll put it on screen but it turned out that the burgers,
[1:51:37.200 --> 1:51:40.800]  the veggie burgers that Gates was putting out in stores, people were rejecting them
[1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:47.760]  and also the one that Burger King was going to put out literally had more soy in one patty
[1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:52.480]  than what someone gendered transitioning would take of estrogen and so I saw those articles,
[1:51:52.480 --> 1:51:56.920]  I mean I ate one of them just to see what it would do, I literally got sick and threw
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:51:58.360]  up three hours later.
[1:51:58.360 --> 1:52:03.600]  So we already know the foods weaponized but this bombing men with soy feminizes men in
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:07.800]  the study show and hyper feminizes girls, that's why what girls usually going to puberty
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:12.520]  at 12, now the average is 9, they have three year olds going into puberty and it's directly
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:17.320]  tied to the plastics, the bisphenol A, but also the soy so let's just back up what you
[1:52:17.320 --> 1:52:21.160]  said and put the study back on screen that you're absolutely right Adam Curry about
[1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:27.600]  soy rage and you see these men that are on it and how they look crazy and just act so
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:31.920]  bizarre because literally they are mainlining estrogen, plant-based estrogen, there it
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:32.920]  is.
[1:52:32.920 --> 1:52:40.720]  I'm glad you found that, some puberty, I'm glad you found that.
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:47.640]  There's a lot at play here, take into account that according to the mainstream and according
[1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:57.200]  to the political left, the most horrible, dangerous, hated people in the United States
[1:52:57.200 --> 1:53:04.120]  certainly are white cis, cis, there you go, so white straight men, this is, you can't
[1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:11.640]  just add, men are complicated and simple at the same time, but men have some very specific
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:17.200]  needs that are not being met, in fact men are checking out, young men are checking out
[1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:24.600]  just in general in amazing numbers, now with all of this Alex I have to say there's so
[1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:31.160]  much hope and so much goodness because we don't have to fall into, we don't have to
[1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:35.000]  follow their systems, we don't have to use their systems, we don't have to buy their
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  fake food.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.920]  And we're going to talk about solutions, I totally agree, but we have to identify the
[1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:44.840]  problem and you're really smart guys, we got time here commercial free, lay it out for us,
[1:53:44.840 --> 1:53:50.560]  but men need a mission, men need a tribe, men need a culture, men need to feel needed and
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:54.640]  when men are told you're workless, you're bad, you're cancer, they go and blow their heads
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:59.480]  off or they drink themselves to death or they just play video games all day, men need to
[1:53:59.480 --> 1:54:04.640]  have a mission and the world is told men you're obsolete, women you're in charge, but really
[1:54:04.640 --> 1:54:08.400]  if you read you've all known Harari and the rest of them, they say actually the post human
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:15.000]  era is in 2047 and humans are obsolete and humans are not in the future, the future is
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:18.720]  not human and I think a lot of women we see the numbers are actually waking up to that
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:23.680]  now and realizing that Gloria Steinem was CIA, culture engineering, none of this was
[1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:28.120]  going to empower women, so spend some time on that, talk about the problem with men and
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:31.240]  what men need.
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:42.040]  Well, I mean, I don't know if I'm qualified to say that, but I am qualified to see the
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:43.520]  observations.
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:46.880]  Let me tell you about the men that I'm working with and the men that the young men I'm talking
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:54.000]  millennials, so around 30, younger could be a little older, they were born around 1990
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.680]  which was a very complicated time, well actually it was a complicated media time because we
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:04.800]  had the first Gulf War, CNN was at that point and hilarious if we go back and take a look
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:11.880]  some of the green screen and fakery and stuff, although what was happening there was real
[1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:16.240]  and I remember sitting with my daughter in her little rocker there just watching this
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:21.160]  day in, day out, it was quite a television experience.
[1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:28.080]  So they grew up with that then around middle school, we have 9-11, now that's traumatic,
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:32.680]  it was traumatic for the world and you can only imagine how that sets certain brains
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:40.760]  in emotion and how they look at things, it's very young, very impressionable.
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:49.120]  Then we invaded the wrong country, there was anthrax, yellow cake, aluminum tubes, weapons
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:56.280]  of mass destruction, lots of imagery, imagery, imagery that just was so destructive and damaging
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:55:59.320]  I think to that generation.
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:04.800]  But it's okay, we're going to find them, it'll all be fine and then that moves on a little
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:11.720]  bit and then we get to the financial crisis, meanwhile this generation is now in school,
[1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:16.920]  in college, many of them and they've taken out loans to get the education they say is
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:22.040]  a guaranteed ticket which has been another marketing exercise to say, yeah, don't just
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:31.680]  get this degree and you'll be good to go, they came out just as the financial collapse,
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:35.160]  and the last time we went through this which is kind of the reason why we're here today
[1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:41.600]  with the financial system and everything fell apart and they saw families having to move
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:48.240]  and that was quite a disastrous couple of years, 2008, 2009 and they were with their
[1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:54.240]  college degrees and it's like, well, this is what you got, $12 an hour, congratulations
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:57:02.080]  or you can maybe drive an Uber or the gig economy and then the social contract was
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:07.600]  kind of broken, that's not what was supposed to happen, now throw some COVID and lockdown
[1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:14.800]  at them and now you see the result, the demoralization is incredible across the board, we have quiet
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:20.520]  quitting, we have all these different things that people are doing and I think in a way
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:28.840]  also positive because people are reevaluating their lives and this is a real positive where
[1:57:28.840 --> 1:57:34.200]  if you worked at any company, any company that had Slack inside its organization, you
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:42.200]  were not working 9-5, you were working 24-7 because that had become the culture of our
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:52.840]  corporate economy, it's our best seller, we first came out with it 5 years ago and it
[1:57:52.840 --> 1:57:58.400]  was a moderate seller but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced what it made
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:03.520]  them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller
[1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:07.200]  and it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock, vitamin mineral fusion
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:12.480]  does it just supercharge your immune system but it helps every cellular function of the
[1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:17.320]  body, it has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:22.720]  that you need to live and be healthy, essential means without these things you die and so
[1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:27.280]  much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical
[1:58:27.280 --> 1:58:31.760]  to bolster our body defenses with a product like this, now there are other great vitamin
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:36.360]  mineral products out there but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it
[1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:40.520]  funds the info war, so the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin
[1:58:40.520 --> 1:58:46.320]  mineral fusion finally back in stock at infoworkstore.com for 50% off, vitamin mineral fusion back
[1:58:46.320 --> 1:58:52.360]  in stock at infoworkstore.com, by the will of God and by God working through you and
[1:58:52.360 --> 1:58:58.520]  your support, info wars continues to persevere against the tax never before seen in the western
[1:58:58.520 --> 1:59:02.600]  world against independent media, thanks for keeping me in the fight and over the years
[1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:07.320]  you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times and kept info wars
[1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:12.240]  and free speech on the air and I thank you, but now I have my own legal bills that have
[1:59:12.240 --> 1:59:16.160]  reached the point that I can't pay them and I need your support, so if you want to keep
[1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:20.920]  this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalist

[1:59:29.720 --> 1:59:35.240]  Alex Jones legal defense fund, this whole phase of their attacks, foyers in the making
[1:59:35.240 --> 1:59:39.720]  is almost over and right at the end we are not giving up, we are not giving in, but we
[1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:44.000]  could give out, so please if you support what we are doing and want to fight for liberty
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:50.160]  and freedom in just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[1:59:50.160 --> 2:00:02.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones, rallying
[2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:08.280]  patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:15.680]  I need to hop on a zoom call, do anything and I believe that people are reevaluating
[2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:19.960]  their lives and saying no, no, that's just not worth it to me and seeing as they came
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:24.960]  from $12 an hour, they're probably willing to give up a little now that we're at $20
[2:00:24.960 --> 2:00:31.360]  an hour, so this is a pullback in enthusiasm, oh yes, I'm sorry, and we're all going to
[2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:35.720]  die by 2030 thanks to climate change, what do you expect?
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:40.560]  Exactly, they're trying to get humanity to go up and roll over but then BlackRock and
[2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:44.840]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan in the last year have sent threat emails out to their employees
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:48.840]  saying if you don't start working four days a week in the office you're fired, so they
[2:00:48.840 --> 2:00:52.640]  told everybody else to quit, to get Main Street to quit, to get the small farmers to quit
[2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:56.280]  so they can consolidate and vertically integrate the economy, but now even their own minions
[2:00:56.280 --> 2:01:02.880]  are quitting and the robot revolution hasn't shown up on time to replace this yet.
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:10.520]  Well I don't know when the robot revolution will come in but you're absolutely right,
[2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:15.160]  and there's no reporting, there's no real analysis of some of these systems that have
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:20.520]  been broken because of this and also mandatory vaccinations.
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:25.000]  The most important one for the United States is our aviation system.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:31.280]  The system is broken, it is completely broken because pilots and aircrew, other aircrew and
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:36.720]  ground crew, the system, but pilots, you really need pilots to fly, many of them would not
[2:01:36.720 --> 2:01:41.840]  accept the vaccine into their life and so they either retired early or they quit, went
[2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:48.560]  to do, I know pilots who are ranchers now and then there was, there's a large contingent
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:54.880]  who literally can no longer be certified to fly because they have side effects such as
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:02:05.800]  myocarditis and other heart issues and it's not that simple to train a pilot to be a commercial
[2:02:05.800 --> 2:02:09.920]  airline aviator.
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:12.080]  The same thing holds true there.
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:17.880]  If you studied and you got your pilot, I'm a pilot like helicopters and fixed wing, just
[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:24.520]  my own, not commercially obviously, if you want to become a pilot you're going to spend
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:29.520]  probably, you could easily spend $40,000 but it's more like $140,000 to become a commercial
[2:02:29.520 --> 2:02:31.020]  airline pilot.
[2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:35.320]  You're going to have that loan that you're paying off and you're going to get in, if
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:40.200]  you're lucky into a regional airline, you're going to be making $35,000, $40,000 a year.
[2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:44.640]  And now we've seen all these headlines of we're going to fire our white pilots and hire
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:49.560]  minority pilots when we're talking a 3, 4, 5, 10 year learning curve, just the time you
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:50.560]  invest is insane.
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:53.360]  I don't want to interrupt you, but I don't want to get accused of trying to cover up
[2:02:53.360 --> 2:02:57.280]  for Big Pharma and Prozac and the mass murder pills.
[2:02:57.280 --> 2:03:01.360]  Let's go back to that segue where I interrupted you to get back into food and let's hit the
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:06.400]  drugs and your view on that and move into politics, the world, where you see this going
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:07.400]  in solutions.
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:15.920]  Well, the media is our problem, which is why I so enjoy what you do and podcasting in general,
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:21.600]  which is why we started podcasting 2.0, to ensure that your podcast is on podcasting
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:23.100]  2.0.
[2:03:23.100 --> 2:03:28.440]  Any podcast can be there unless you don't want it there, then it's taken off and it's
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:33.520]  distributed, so they can try and come after whatever we're doing, but it's distributed.
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:35.280]  There's no way to take it down.
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:36.280]  Let's just get this in there.
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:39.680]  You say you're not an expert, but you are really smart.
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:43.400]  I know you know what you're talking about, because all of this research, you are an expert
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:49.360]  in old media, new media, and have been in the vanguard of media for what is it, 40 years.
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:51.720]  So speak to that, Adam.
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:56.880]  You don't look that old, but you've been around a while, so you're an OG in this.
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:02.000]  You pioneered podcasting, where do you see the censorship wars, the dying corporate media
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:05.280]  trying to use censorship to cut down their competition, but the more they do that, it
[2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:08.760]  just gives room for even more people to come forward.
[2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:12.840]  What's going to happen in this big struggle between dinosaur media ally with big tech
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:19.240]  against the public's just craving for real independent ideas?
[2:04:19.240 --> 2:04:27.880]  Well, the problem is the business model, if you have any corporate money involved in
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:30.720]  media, it's a problem.
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:37.400]  So advertising is a problem, because advertising is always censorship.
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:42.200]  At the very minimum, you can't talk about a competing product while you have a product
[2:04:42.200 --> 2:04:46.320]  or service who is sponsoring your program.
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:51.680]  Having been in this business for a long time with commercial television and radio, the
[2:04:51.680 --> 2:05:20.400]  advertiser rules, the advertiser, if they don't want, they're there.
[2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:27.160]  All three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your
[2:05:27.160 --> 2:05:31.000]  stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:37.440]  So X3, despite the fact that it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right
[2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:43.240]  now at infowarstore.com, and it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[2:05:43.240 --> 2:05:47.280]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick out on average.
[2:05:47.280 --> 2:06:08.920]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off, X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[2:06:08.920 --> 2:06:13.560]  And we're already in the hour number three on this Friday, October 14th, worldwide transmission.
[2:06:13.560 --> 2:06:18.800]  We're going to finish up with some of the key excerpts of the Adam Curry historic interview,
[2:06:18.800 --> 2:06:24.480]  the full hour and a half plus interview, and we'll be posted later today to band.video.
[2:06:24.480 --> 2:06:30.000]  And then coming up in a little while, probably my most important interview out of more than
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:34.760]  60 or 70 over the years, coming more than that, now maybe 100, with the great David
[2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:35.760]  Ike.
[2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:40.080]  So that's coming up right into the fourth hour today, but here we are in the third hour.
[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:43.600]  I want to thank all the listeners and viewers and just appreciate your support.
[2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:46.960]  I want to clarify this again, I know most of you know this, but a lot of new listeners
[2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:48.560]  are tuning in, they don't know it.
[2:06:48.560 --> 2:06:51.120]  We're not going away, we're not being shut down.
[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:55.920]  This billion dollar verdicts of fraud, I don't have $3 million in the company or personally,
[2:06:55.920 --> 2:06:58.760]  they're not allowed to take away our First Amendment, we're not going to back down.
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:03.200]  As long as you support the broadcast and buy products and spread the word at infowarstore.com,
[2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:04.720]  we're not going anywhere.
[2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:09.320]  We're going to appeal these fraudulent decisions, this kangaroo court, and so much more.
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:13.280]  If you want to really know the details of it, Stephen Crowder wanted the full data dump.
[2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:19.000]  I did an hour long interview with him yesterday that's posted at infowars.com or on Stephen
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:22.920]  Crowder's YouTube, where we want all the details, all the facts, all the numbers, everything
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:28.000]  about me, you name it, you want to know where the fight's at, you can find that with that
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:35.400]  edition, that Thursday edition, now it's Friday, but again, you can find it at infowars.com.
[2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:41.120]  So, I'm going to get back to the conclusion of the very important Adam Curry interview,
[2:07:41.120 --> 2:07:46.320]  and then as I said, David, I guess coming up, I'm so honored and humbled by your support
[2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:47.960]  and your outpouring of love.
[2:07:47.960 --> 2:07:51.440]  Look, I knew I was in a fight with the New World Order, I expected these attacks and
[2:07:51.440 --> 2:07:52.440]  far more.
[2:07:52.440 --> 2:07:56.040]  So, I'm just blessed to be here, we're going up against pure evil, the world is waking
[2:07:56.040 --> 2:07:58.560]  up and it's a beautiful time to be alive.
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:03.480]  Just remember how incredibly powerful you are when you resist, when you speak up, when
[2:08:03.480 --> 2:08:08.440]  you say no, and when you share information like this broadcast with our incredible guests,
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:11.920]  callers, special reports, and my analysis, and so much more.
[2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:15.600]  So, thank you for your support, got a big mega sale, it's been extended through the

[2:08:56.920 --> 2:08:59.760]  back to Adam Curry, the inventor of podcasting.
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:05.880]  We're over a particular type of content, they will just stop advertising, and that's
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:16.360]  why the media is cucked, I mean the two big, right now the television advertising are saying
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:20.640]  hey, we're going to be great, it's going to be a great year, screw the recession, everything's
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:24.560]  going to be fine, but we're looking to the numbers, the reason why is because we have
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:28.560]  an election year, so they know that a billion dollars or more is going to be spent on the
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:31.280]  midterm elections, and pharma.
[2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:39.400]  So Pfizer, we've all seen the supercuts, they in essence own the media, which is why there's
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:44.800]  no real pushback against anything when it comes to pharmaceuticals, there you go, that's
[2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:47.880]  a perfect chart of how it all fits together.
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:55.360]  So what Dvorak and I discovered 15 years ago when we started the No Agenda podcast is
[2:09:55.360 --> 2:10:00.040]  it is very possible, and you know this too, to make a living.
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:05.200]  Now we only do an audio podcast, we don't have video, we literally do everything ourselves,
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:11.480]  our family members help out with some back office stuff, and we keep it very lean, I
[2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:16.280]  do all the audio production, and we have been able to sustain ourselves and our families
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:21.000]  with purely only support from the listeners, which we call producers because we expect
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:26.720]  them to produce with their time, their talent, or their treasure, for it'll be 15 years,
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:31.400]  the 26th of October, and it's only grown, it's only been better and more rewarding
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:32.600]  to do this.
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:40.440]  These models work, the minute you have anything that has finances attached to it, that's what
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:42.320]  will be gone after.
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:48.680]  So let's elaborate on that because I've uniquely gone through things that have shown me how
[2:10:48.680 --> 2:10:53.320]  the system works that a lot of folks have, you have as well, but to quantify what you
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:58.840]  were saying earlier, it's so important, whether it's CNN or ABC News or any of these places,
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:03.880]  they're extincting themselves because they're owned and controlled by corporate interest
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:08.280]  that simply use them as a repeater system, and the public has figured that out, but they
[2:11:08.280 --> 2:11:13.000]  can't stop because their sponsors won't let them, and anybody that's had sponsors
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:16.520]  learns over time, they try to take control of your life, that's why we moved to Direct
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:19.800]  Cell of Products at infowarstore.com.
[2:11:19.800 --> 2:11:23.040]  Our radio and TV stations still have their ads, that's what people hear during most of
[2:11:23.040 --> 2:11:29.960]  the breaks is the affiliates break, but absolutely, and so as this decentralization happens,
[2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:34.280]  they've had this big concerted effort, I remember a Wall Street Journal article five years ago
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:38.840]  that was a subscriber article, but the article that linked to it that had some excerpts was
[2:11:38.840 --> 2:11:44.440]  I think Gizmodo and it had the headline, hold on to your tinfoil hat, Alex Jones, you're
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:48.760]  about to be taken off the air, and in that big 25-page article that it linked to out
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:54.080]  of the Wall Street Journal, they said, this was an article before news course split and
[2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:58.360]  sold off entertainment to Disney, and they kept its news division, the Wall Street Journal,
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:03.520]  Fox News, and the local stations they own, and systems, and they said in there, people
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:06.040]  are going to read this article, I read an article like ten times back at the time, that's
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:11.440]  why I knew I was about to be de-platformed, they said, we're going to censor WikiLeaks,
[2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:16.880]  and when the corporate media censors it together, when the left accepts that, we'll have the
[2:12:16.880 --> 2:12:21.800]  left censor, that's how they saw it, and when we censor Alex Jones in the coming months,
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:25.840]  when the right wing doesn't stand up for him, we'll set the president to censor them, so
[2:12:25.840 --> 2:12:30.880]  it's Jack Spratt could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean, between the two they licked
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:37.600]  the platter clean, so people asked how I knew this was coming, they skated it to their shareholders
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:43.280]  saying you think corporate media is done, you think we're going to be supplanted by the
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:48.080]  base of the Alex Joneses and Julian Assange's of the day, now it's Joe Rogan, and of course
[2:12:48.080 --> 2:12:53.640]  you're bigger than ever, and the Adam Curry's, and so many others, but there they were telling
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:59.680]  their shareholders in no uncertain terms, we're working with major governments and corporations
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:03.840]  in big tech to bring in a new dark age of censorship against everybody, and when they
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:08.200]  don't stand up to the first domino with Julian Assange and Alex Jones, all the dominoes will
[2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:13.120]  go down, but yes there's been massive censorship, yes they even censor a former president, but
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:17.800]  it's backfiring even more now in my view, can you give us your take on my analysis, if you
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:21.880]  think it's accurate, and how you see this fight unfolding?
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:27.720]  It is accurate, but what's interesting is everyone, most people I think are looking
[2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:36.320]  at media the wrong way now, once the guardrails, the gatekeepers were removed, so what I mean
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:41.800]  by that is, and this was part of, I don't want to call it a vision, but when I approached
[2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:50.400]  Dave Weiner to implement some technical changes in RSS for podcasting, it was all part of
[2:13:50.400 --> 2:13:56.960]  solving a way to use the internet to broadcast, and the whole point was, we don't need transmitters,
[2:13:56.960 --> 2:14:01.320]  by the way, take your time, stop, stop, because you are credited as being the founder of the
[2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:07.200]  podcast idea, not just your new show in the last 15 years, you're relatively new, but
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:14.960]  going back, take your time here, because you are an expert on this, explaining this handing
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:20.120]  over of power or keys to the public, and this giant revolution that changed the whole world,
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:24.520]  this is one hell of an achievement, I mean this is like literally the Wright brothers
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:30.320]  and Kitty Hawk or Henry Ford and his assembly line, and I'm not blowing smoke, this is real
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:34.520]  Adam, this is a big deal, so take your time on this.
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:42.000]  It's fun to see that the core of podcasting is this one little thing called RSS, which
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:47.720]  is you can make it in a notepad, you can write one yourself, you typically have a hosting
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:55.880]  company, but it's just an XML is what it is, it's a computer readable instruction text
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:15:01.880]  file, computers can read it, but as a human you can read it as well, and because it's
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:09.580]  exactly that simple, anybody with one of these files and an MP3 recorder and a web server
[2:15:09.580 --> 2:15:11.080]  can create a podcast.
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:16.120]  So how did you visionary see that decentralization and then help get the code change and launch
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:18.080]  it, because this is a big deal?
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:23.240]  Honestly, I didn't see the decentralization in that manner at the time, what I saw, I
[2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:30.560]  just wanted to do a radio show, people have no idea what it's really like to be in mainstream
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:35.600]  because you really are very, there's line producers and people, you can't say this,
[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:40.600]  you can't say that, there's people in your ear talking, on the radio we have this famously
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:45.200]  oh goodness, the hotline is going, that's the PD, the program director, I screwed up,
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:48.880]  I said something wrong, you know, whatever it is, it's very stressful and you just build
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:53.400]  up these filters and it becomes very debilitating, and these are the filters that got put in
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:56.720]  in the 20s once radio became.
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:03.560]  Think about a world without InfoWars, just take a moment and sit back and think about
[2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:08.440]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family
[2:16:08.440 --> 2:16:11.160]  that is InfoWars.
[2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:16.480]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and other
[2:16:16.480 --> 2:16:24.040]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[2:16:24.040 --> 2:16:27.280]  base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:33.040]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:39.600]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show, I don't take the credit, I give
[2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:44.240]  you the credit, and now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:47.240]  up, without your support we can be shut down.
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:57.640]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our Legal Defense Fund.
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:05.120]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globals, I have come from nowhere to the
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:09.080]  very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:14.640]  We are engaging the Globals at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:15.640]  deserve the credit.
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:20.560]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars for the real
[2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:26.200]  reason we've had this success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against
[2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:28.520]  the New World Order we've ever had.
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:34.920]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:39.120]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight, and to continue
[2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:42.120]  in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[2:17:42.120 --> 2:17:47.760]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:51.600]  now, because we are over the target and this victory is happening.
[2:17:51.600 --> 2:17:56.480]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.

[2:20:27.760 --> 2:20:32.400]  Talk if you can for a moment about the safety, what have you learned about serious side effects
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:42.000]  in this vaccine?
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:45.720]  Do you anticipate or maybe stay up at night thinking about the possibility you're going
[2:20:45.720 --> 2:21:07.000]  to have to go back in the lab at some point and come up with something better?
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:29.640]  It's not like we control the world, let's get down to business, let's talk about reptoids,

[2:22:06.760 --> 2:22:11.320]  I gave you my kidney and it was delicious.
[2:22:11.320 --> 2:22:16.960]  Reagan, meet my favorite reptoid tentatives, Barb Shrike and Xarthax Griswold Walton of
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:18.800]  the Reptoid High Council.
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:21.280]  Good evening, your lizardness.
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:23.840]  We reptoids had had a great decade.
[2:22:23.840 --> 2:22:29.120]  Just a propaganda in the media, we had made society more tolerant of our kind from the
[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:32.360]  Geico Gekko to the shape of water.
[2:22:32.360 --> 2:22:36.800]  We even got K-Rule in smash, we did it everyone.
[2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:41.800]  The world temperature is rising, the time is coming brethren, soon we shall fulfill the
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:53.040]  prophecy, overthrow humanity and become the true rulers of the world.
[2:22:53.040 --> 2:22:56.200]  As our video, Pfizer's CEO shocks the world, Band-Aid video.
[2:22:56.200 --> 2:23:00.400]  We're having a little fun here and I got David Ike on this emergency Saturday show because
[2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:03.880]  I want to cover the wheels coming off.
[2:23:03.880 --> 2:23:08.200]  The whole Pfizer COVID hysteria, the emitting and erasure of your immune system, it kills
[2:23:08.200 --> 2:23:15.520]  you, euthanizing the old people, Russia, the pipeline, Elon Musk and his AI robots.
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:20.800]  So much to talk about with the iconic David Ike, DavidIke.com or Iconic.com has his own
[2:23:20.800 --> 2:23:23.440]  channel on Band-Aid video, David Ike.
[2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:27.360]  David, great to have you here, it's commercial free, we've got about 50 minutes with you,
[2:23:27.360 --> 2:23:28.640]  I appreciate you coming on with us.
[2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:33.120]  I'm going to try to sit back and let you roll here, love the new studio, love how you've
[2:23:33.120 --> 2:23:35.560]  been fighting back and not giving into the censorship.
[2:23:35.560 --> 2:23:39.920]  So you're quite the icon here, total trailblazer, great to have you here with us.
[2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:49.200]  Thanks mate, I'll tell you what, it might be a good place to start with the subject in
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:58.760]  the intro because when I came out with all that stuff a long time ago now, decades ago,
[2:23:58.760 --> 2:24:07.400]  30 years ago, that it's in the end what you're looking at is a non-human force manipulating
[2:24:07.400 --> 2:24:09.200]  human society.
[2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:13.800]  Of course people thought that was crazy and that was ridiculous and he's crazy and he's
[2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:16.960]  mad and all the rest of it.
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:24.200]  But as it's become more and more obvious, Alex, that what we're looking at is an anti-human
[2:24:24.200 --> 2:24:34.160]  agenda in which the very basics of human survival are being very blatantly targeted, more and
[2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:41.400]  more and more people are beginning to ask the question, well, maybe if we're looking
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:51.600]  at this extreme anti-human agenda, maybe there's a non-human force behind it then because we're
[2:24:51.600 --> 2:24:59.640]  looking at, look at the basics, the basics of life, the food, warmth, the atmosphere is
[2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:10.560]  being changed and you are looking at water, supplies and access increasingly being targeted.
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:18.480]  All these different areas of basic human survival are being targeted and then you look at the
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:29.560]  human body which is, as they call it, a biological phenomenon and then you see these fake vaccines
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:36.000]  which they've created this COVID hoax to justify, of course, and they're putting synthetic
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:42.880]  genetic material into the body which as we've seen many, many, many times now is self-replicating
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:54.160]  and building nanotechnology systems which I say are designed to connect the human body,
[2:25:54.160 --> 2:26:03.920]  the human brain to what they call the cloud and at the same time the cloud is being created
[2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:12.640]  not just by 5G towers and 6G and 7G in the pipeline but from increasingly from low orbit
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:19.320]  satellites, vast numbers of them being put up there by Elon Musk who's supposed to be
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:22.240]  a man of the people who cares about our freedom of speech.
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:29.820]  Well, it's funny because creating this cloud and then connecting the human brain to it
[2:26:29.820 --> 2:26:37.480]  via nanotechnology is straight off the script of this global cult as I call it and this
[2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:44.600]  global cult is the same cult that's behind the global destruction of freedom of speech
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:48.280]  and all the censorship.
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:27:00.640]  So I think what we need to do a little bit, those that are beginning to see this is to
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:04.920]  realize where it's coming from.
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:14.520]  From where I come from is that this world we call the human world, the so-called physical
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:20.780]  world that we're interacting with, that's like a movie screen.
[2:27:20.780 --> 2:27:25.980]  When it hits the movie screen, if you're sitting in a movie theater, when the film hits the
[2:27:25.980 --> 2:27:31.860]  screen, it's a done deal, you're changing it then, you're changing it from where it's
[2:27:31.860 --> 2:27:42.460]  being projected from, where it's coming from and the reason that the nature of reality,
[2:27:42.460 --> 2:27:49.020]  the nature of the true eye is not taught in the schools and the universities, it's not
[2:27:49.020 --> 2:27:55.540]  explored by the media is because we're not meant to know that because once we realize
[2:27:55.540 --> 2:28:00.420]  the nature of reality, the nature of the eye, the nature of who we are, the nature of what
[2:28:00.420 --> 2:28:09.340]  this is, the pennies drop on how the whole thing, the whole deal is being orchestrated
[2:28:09.340 --> 2:28:13.620]  and that's what I go into in my new book just out called The Trap.
[2:28:13.620 --> 2:28:21.020]  So first of all, we have to realize if we're going to grasp this is what we call the world
[2:28:21.020 --> 2:28:27.460]  of the scene is not everything that exists in the space that we're looking at, it's
[2:28:27.460 --> 2:28:36.220]  a tiny, tiny, ridiculously tiny band of frequency which we call visible light and visible light
[2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:42.940]  is a smear, an absolute smear, a fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum and according
[2:28:42.940 --> 2:28:48.900]  to mainstream science, that electromagnetic spectrum within which visible light, the only
[2:28:48.900 --> 2:28:56.860]  band we can see is a tiny part.
[2:28:56.860 --> 2:29:02.380]  It's our best seller, we first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller
[2:29:02.380 --> 2:29:07.020]  but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[2:29:07.020 --> 2:29:11.620]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller and it's
[2:29:11.620 --> 2:29:14.420]  been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[2:29:14.420 --> 2:29:19.860]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system but it helps every cellular
[2:29:19.860 --> 2:29:20.860]  function of the body.
[2:29:20.860 --> 2:29:25.660]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[2:29:25.660 --> 2:29:31.060]  need to live and be healthy, essential means without these things you die and so much the
[2:29:31.060 --> 2:29:35.980]  food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster
[2:29:35.980 --> 2:29:38.580]  our body's defenses with a product like this.
[2:29:38.580 --> 2:29:42.000]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there but this is amongst the
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:46.740]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the InfoWare so the only way you lose is not
[2:29:46.740 --> 2:29:51.940]  taking action today getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at InfoWareStore.com
[2:29:51.940 --> 2:29:56.580]  for a 50% off, vitamin mineral fusion back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[2:29:56.580 --> 2:30:01.740]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's
[2:30:01.740 --> 2:30:06.260]  on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to
[2:30:06.260 --> 2:30:09.380]  their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[2:30:09.380 --> 2:30:12.580]  Well it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[2:30:12.580 --> 2:30:17.300]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[2:30:17.300 --> 2:30:21.260]  don't listen and they don't supplement it's literally an intervention.
[2:30:21.260 --> 2:30:26.660]  I lead an incredibly stressful life, I don't play with Mr. Health but if I wasn't taking
[2:30:26.660 --> 2:30:33.060]  products like X3 from InfoWareStore.com I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[2:30:33.060 --> 2:30:38.200]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible and despite the
[2:30:38.200 --> 2:30:44.500]  fact that selling out X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[2:30:44.500 --> 2:30:47.140]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[2:30:47.140 --> 2:30:50.460]  We're not selling it for that, we're selling it for what it does for your immune system
[2:30:50.460 --> 2:30:51.900]  and your focus and clarity.
[2:30:51.900 --> 2:30:56.740]  Get X3 today 50% off at InfoWareStore.com all supplies last.
[2:30:56.740 --> 2:31:01.860]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions
[2:31:01.860 --> 2:31:03.180]  is now happening.
[2:31:03.180 --> 2:31:07.900]  InfoWare's credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's because of your
[2:31:07.900 --> 2:31:13.980]  backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and
[2:31:13.980 --> 2:31:19.820]  the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air but now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[2:31:19.820 --> 2:31:20.820]  in the fight together.
[2:31:20.820 --> 2:31:26.580]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[2:31:26.580 --> 2:31:30.500]  In my decades on air I've never asked for personal donations but I've been forced by
[2:31:30.500 --> 2:31:36.020]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[2:31:36.020 --> 2:31:37.020]  It's unsustainable.
[2:31:37.020 --> 2:31:45.260]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, $5,
[2:31:45.260 --> 2:31:49.540]  $10, $50, $100, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.

[2:32:58.380 --> 2:33:12.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:12.220 --> 2:33:23.340]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[2:33:23.340 --> 2:33:24.340]  Jones.
[2:33:24.340 --> 2:33:36.620]  The band we can see is a tiny part, that spectrum itself is only around 0.005% of what exists
[2:33:36.620 --> 2:33:39.980]  in what they call the universe.
[2:33:39.980 --> 2:33:52.100]  So we are seeing next to nothing and to understand that is to grasp how these non-human entities
[2:33:52.100 --> 2:34:01.220]  in the end, this consciousness that's manipulating human society can do it without us being seen
[2:34:01.220 --> 2:34:02.220]  as seeing.
[2:34:02.220 --> 2:34:05.220]  And David, to interrupt, as you've been saying for 30 years, I've read most of your books,
[2:34:05.220 --> 2:34:08.140]  I haven't read the new one, but I read first books you wrote 30 years ago that have been
[2:34:08.140 --> 2:34:09.740]  proven to be dead on.
[2:34:09.740 --> 2:34:14.260]  They don't even want us in the visual light spectrum, they want us in the VR, in the matrix,
[2:34:14.260 --> 2:34:18.660]  they want to even get us out of what we can see at this level to be able to totally confuse
[2:34:18.660 --> 2:34:19.660]  us.
[2:34:19.660 --> 2:34:23.860]  As part of the lockdowns, they now admit was forcing us into the metaverse.
[2:34:23.860 --> 2:34:30.500]  Yeah, I mean, from where I'm coming from, and you know, just after the turn of the millennium,
[2:34:30.500 --> 2:34:41.220]  I said that this reality is actually a simulation, it's a virtual reality, it's an illusion
[2:34:41.220 --> 2:34:46.180]  to confuses and to hijack our perception of reality.
[2:34:46.180 --> 2:34:54.060]  And I said at that time that the limit of this simulation at the level we experience
[2:34:54.060 --> 2:35:00.620]  it as the human world, because there are other levels of it, which I talk about in the trap,
[2:35:00.620 --> 2:35:04.460]  that limit is the speed of light.
[2:35:04.460 --> 2:35:11.020]  So the speed of light is not the fastest speed possible, as people like Einstein said, no,
[2:35:11.020 --> 2:35:16.580]  it's pedestrian compared with what's possible, but it is the limit of this simulation, which
[2:35:16.580 --> 2:35:21.780]  is why it appears to be the fastest speed when you're in the simulation.
[2:35:21.780 --> 2:35:31.740]  And then in the spring of 2021, Scientific American ran a story, an article by an academic,
[2:35:31.740 --> 2:35:39.460]  and he said that he concluded that we live in a simulation and the limit of the simulation
[2:35:39.460 --> 2:35:41.460]  is the speed of light.
[2:35:41.460 --> 2:35:47.420]  And one of the things I've been saying over the decades is that what we call the laws
[2:35:47.420 --> 2:35:56.800]  of physics are actually the coding that's written into the simulation.
[2:35:56.800 --> 2:36:04.020]  So when you're creating a virtual reality game, which mimics the reality we're in, you
[2:36:04.020 --> 2:36:09.420]  write the codes, you write the rules of the game, the limits of the game, what you can
[2:36:09.420 --> 2:36:19.100]  do, what you can't do, and what we call the laws of physics are actually the rules of
[2:36:19.100 --> 2:36:23.660]  the simulation, which have been put in there as part of the control system.
[2:36:23.660 --> 2:36:31.980]  And what this academic said in Scientific American is that we live in a simulation,
[2:36:31.980 --> 2:36:38.420]  its limit is the speed of light, and he related, and I say quite rightly, the speed of light
[2:36:38.420 --> 2:36:40.540]  to processing speed.
[2:36:40.540 --> 2:36:47.460]  So if you're writing a virtual reality computer game, then you write the rules, but even though
[2:36:47.460 --> 2:36:54.100]  you're doing that, you're still limited by your processing speed, as this article said,
[2:36:54.100 --> 2:36:57.220]  and so that's the limit of the simulation.
[2:36:57.220 --> 2:37:04.300]  And so this is like a projection, I do explain in the books how it's created, how we actually
[2:37:04.300 --> 2:37:10.300]  create it in fact, but it's the projection.
[2:37:10.300 --> 2:37:13.540]  So the question is, where does the projection come from?
[2:37:13.540 --> 2:37:20.860]  Where does this, because you know, if you look at the Matrix movies, Alex, and the symbolism
[2:37:20.860 --> 2:37:31.180]  of them, the Neo and Morpheus, etc., they're in the ship, they're outside the Matrix, outside
[2:37:31.180 --> 2:37:33.020]  of it.
[2:37:33.020 --> 2:37:38.540]  And so what happens is they go into the Matrix with that probe in the back of the neck, actually
[2:37:38.540 --> 2:37:46.140]  in the reptilian brain part of the human brain fun enough, and they go into the Matrix, not
[2:37:46.140 --> 2:37:50.580]  with their bodies, they go into them with their minds.
[2:37:50.580 --> 2:37:54.980]  And that's what I'm talking about in the trap about how actually all this is happening
[2:37:54.980 --> 2:37:55.980]  in our mind.
[2:37:55.980 --> 2:37:59.340]  It's literally is a mind game.
[2:37:59.340 --> 2:38:01.340]  Where's the mind?
[2:38:01.340 --> 2:38:02.340]  Okay.
[2:38:02.340 --> 2:38:07.420]  So basically, a little bit more to it than this, yes, but basically a way of putting
[2:38:07.420 --> 2:38:15.660]  it really simply is if you can't see it, then it's not in this dimension.
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:17.460]  And so it's in another dimension.
[2:38:17.460 --> 2:38:22.580]  So you can see a brain, yeah, okay, there's the brain.
[2:38:22.580 --> 2:38:28.460]  Well, therefore, it's in this reality, we'll call it 3D reality, there it is, the brain.
[2:38:28.460 --> 2:38:34.060]  But the brain is not the source of consciousness.
[2:38:34.060 --> 2:38:38.340]  What it does is process information.
[2:38:38.340 --> 2:38:39.340]  It's the receiver.
[2:38:39.340 --> 2:38:44.940]  Yes, the receiver, in that sense, it processes information.
[2:38:44.940 --> 2:38:49.220]  Now, the question is, where does that information come from?
[2:38:49.220 --> 2:38:56.420]  Because we have this whole concept now, although science denied it, that writes up to quite
[2:38:56.420 --> 2:38:57.420]  recently.
[2:38:57.420 --> 2:39:02.260]  I mean, what you said 25 years ago is now accepted mainline science.
[2:39:02.260 --> 2:39:04.260]  I read it in Scientific America, everywhere.
[2:39:04.260 --> 2:39:06.940]  All the big billionaires, they sound like David Ike now.
[2:39:06.940 --> 2:39:10.940]  But they say, oh, we're going to jack into it and create a new reality for you, instead
[2:39:10.940 --> 2:39:14.460]  of not letting you know that we could break free of this as well.
[2:39:14.460 --> 2:39:18.700]  I mean, obviously, they're not going to bring us into some bigger, better reality.
[2:39:18.700 --> 2:39:22.900]  Everything they do is to make the reality smaller and more controlled.
[2:39:22.900 --> 2:39:27.380]  More and more myopia of sense of reality, that's what the metaverse is about.
[2:39:27.380 --> 2:39:30.940]  It's about creating a simulation within a simulation.
[2:39:30.940 --> 2:39:34.300]  In fact, a simulation within a simulation within a simulation.
[2:39:34.300 --> 2:39:36.660]  So you've got the simulation we call the human world.
[2:39:36.660 --> 2:39:41.580]  Then you've got the smart grid, which is actually another simulation.
[2:39:41.580 --> 2:39:44.340]  And then you've got the metaverse, which is another simulation.
[2:39:44.340 --> 2:39:48.140]  And they admit the internet of things, the smart grid, is a new world.
[2:39:48.140 --> 2:39:49.340]  They call it a new dimension.
[2:39:49.340 --> 2:39:52.460]  They're creating of the machines interfacing and directing us.
[2:39:52.460 --> 2:39:53.460]  So it's a prison.
[2:39:53.460 --> 2:39:55.420]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[2:39:55.420 --> 2:39:59.020]  And that's why people should look at Elon Musk and ask, what the heck are you doing?
[2:39:59.020 --> 2:40:03.020]  Because almost virtually, no, no, no, no, not virtually.
[2:40:03.020 --> 2:40:08.140]  Everything he does and produces is straight off the script of the cult.
[2:40:08.140 --> 2:40:10.340]  But I was saying, you've got the brain.
[2:40:10.340 --> 2:40:12.420]  So you can see that that's in this reality.
[2:40:12.420 --> 2:40:14.380]  And it's processing information.
[2:40:14.380 --> 2:40:25.340]  And this concept of brain placidity, there's a placidity about the brain in this sense.
[2:40:25.340 --> 2:40:31.180]  They believed until relatively recently that once the brain formed, that was it.
[2:40:31.180 --> 2:40:32.580]  That was the brain for your life.
[2:40:32.580 --> 2:40:34.380]  Now they know very different.
[2:40:34.380 --> 2:40:41.940]  They know that the brain changes according to the information it receives.
[2:40:41.940 --> 2:40:49.780]  So if you have one source of information, the cult narrative, let's say, in all its forms,
[2:40:49.780 --> 2:40:55.420]  and you never look outside of that for other forms of information and other explanations,
[2:40:55.420 --> 2:41:01.580]  your brain, and this is mainstream science now, your brain will process information
[2:41:01.580 --> 2:41:07.460]  and all the neurons and the neuron networks will form to process that information.
[2:41:07.460 --> 2:41:09.380]  And I'm going to interrupt you because you're right.
[2:41:09.380 --> 2:41:11.100]  This is mainline science now.
[2:41:11.100 --> 2:41:16.340]  Blue light is making little girls go into puberty earlier just from iPads and screams.
[2:41:16.340 --> 2:41:18.580]  That's mainline scientific study two weeks ago.
[2:41:18.580 --> 2:41:22.340]  And they admit that people that watch more TV, that isn't interactive, people that just
[2:41:22.340 --> 2:41:27.540]  sit there and vegetate, don't grow the new neuron networks and literally get early onset
[2:41:27.540 --> 2:41:29.860]  of Alzheimer's and die early.
[2:41:29.860 --> 2:41:33.900]  And they admit young people in South Korea are dying from watching 20 hours of television
[2:41:33.900 --> 2:41:36.900]  today because your body just literally turns off.
[2:41:36.900 --> 2:41:39.780]  Bottom line, this stuff is killing us.
[2:41:39.780 --> 2:41:53.540]  A very simple way of doing an analogy for this is imagine that you had Wi-Fi which is
[2:41:53.540 --> 2:42:07.220]  outside the computer or around us, but you program the computer not to read, decode,
[2:42:07.220 --> 2:42:13.940]  process vast amounts of information in Wi-Fi.
[2:42:13.940 --> 2:42:20.420]  What you would do, the information would still be there, but it wouldn't be in a form that
[2:42:20.420 --> 2:42:27.820]  you could see and interact with because the computer would not take that Wi-Fi and put
[2:42:27.820 --> 2:42:32.620]  it on the screen in the form of words, graphics, moving pictures and so on.
[2:42:32.620 --> 2:42:39.100]  And that's what they're doing with the human brain because they know about this malleable
[2:42:39.100 --> 2:42:40.780]  nature of the brain.
[2:42:40.780 --> 2:42:47.620]  They are trying, this is one level of it, they're trying to just let you have one source
[2:42:47.620 --> 2:42:48.620]  of information.
[2:42:48.620 --> 2:42:56.620]  It's what censorship is all about.
[2:42:56.620 --> 2:43:02.900]  I don't promote things unless they really work, when it comes to politics or culture,
[2:43:02.900 --> 2:43:07.100]  economics, we are always the cutting edge, the tip of the spear, and when we talk about
[2:43:07.100 --> 2:43:11.300]  the products in infomercials.com, they all blow you away, if you'll just take them,
[2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:14.300]  if you'll just try them, I know you'll be, we'll be customers.
[2:43:14.300 --> 2:43:18.140]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months, it's back in stock, it's

[2:46:44.300 --> 2:46:48.500]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[2:46:52.140 --> 2:46:58.340]  and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:46:58.340 --> 2:47:05.340]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:23.340]  Live from the Info Wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:23.340 --> 2:47:31.220]  So that your brain forms, your neurons in your networks form to process that.
[2:47:31.220 --> 2:47:39.220]  And literally, if you're in that mode, and it solidifies enough, it doesn't matter what
[2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:47.100]  information you receive in other ways, because this is why people look at others saying that
[2:47:47.100 --> 2:47:48.100]  the COVID era.
[2:47:48.100 --> 2:47:52.140]  And they say, look, why can't they get it?
[2:47:52.140 --> 2:47:53.140]  It's so obvious.
[2:47:53.140 --> 2:48:00.660]  Well, it's obvious to you, because your brain is in a state where it can process that information
[2:48:00.660 --> 2:48:02.500]  that sees through the illusion.
[2:48:02.500 --> 2:48:10.780]  But if you're stuck in this repetitive, that the brain will only decode certain information,
[2:48:10.780 --> 2:48:16.940]  which is basically frequencies, then you're literally, literally not going to be able
[2:48:16.940 --> 2:48:21.260]  to compute what's actually happening.
[2:48:21.260 --> 2:48:25.620]  And this is why they want us only to see the mainstream media, shut off all other media.
[2:48:25.620 --> 2:48:32.740]  That's why they're going for you, because they want to control the source of information,
[2:48:32.740 --> 2:48:35.260]  because from the information comes our perception.
[2:48:35.260 --> 2:48:40.940]  From our perception comes the way the brain wires itself.
[2:48:40.940 --> 2:48:48.340]  And they're terrified of other information being made available to people, which will
[2:48:48.340 --> 2:48:53.620]  over time, and with some who are more malleable immediately, will get them to see, actually
[2:48:53.620 --> 2:48:55.940]  there's a different way of looking at the world.
[2:48:55.940 --> 2:49:02.300]  And at that point, the brain in its malleable nature will start changing and start firing
[2:49:02.300 --> 2:49:03.300]  in a different way.
[2:49:03.300 --> 2:49:07.820]  And it will start processing another form, sense of reality and perception.
[2:49:07.820 --> 2:49:10.260]  Now that's what they don't want.
[2:49:10.260 --> 2:49:19.020]  What they have to do is hold us purely in five sense reality, because once we are processing
[2:49:19.020 --> 2:49:25.220]  information and processing our perceptions only through five sense reality, they got
[2:49:25.220 --> 2:49:26.220]  us.
[2:49:26.220 --> 2:49:27.220]  We're in the trap.
[2:49:27.220 --> 2:49:28.220]  We're in the jail.
[2:49:28.220 --> 2:49:30.020]  We're in the cell.
[2:49:30.020 --> 2:49:36.540]  And so they are seeking to control in every way the information that we see.
[2:49:36.540 --> 2:49:39.500]  And there's no doubt they're doing that and you've been vindicated in spades.
[2:49:39.500 --> 2:49:42.620]  So big picture, because I want to go through a lot of current issues with you.
[2:49:42.620 --> 2:49:48.060]  How are things going for the architects of this post-human world, this cyborg takeover
[2:49:48.060 --> 2:49:50.940]  matrix they admit they're now launching?
[2:49:50.940 --> 2:49:52.540]  How would you lay out the current state of the world?
[2:49:52.540 --> 2:49:55.540]  Because it seems like there's a huge awakening happening, but they're also coming down on
[2:49:55.540 --> 2:49:57.060]  us with both feet.
[2:49:57.060 --> 2:49:58.060]  Yeah.
[2:49:58.060 --> 2:50:05.020]  I mean, we are in a real state of transition here.
[2:50:05.020 --> 2:50:09.420]  And we go a certain way and we'll dismantle this.
[2:50:09.420 --> 2:50:13.380]  We go another way and it will get more and more extreme.
[2:50:13.380 --> 2:50:16.900]  And again, we come back to the same thing, Alex.
[2:50:16.900 --> 2:50:24.780]  The stadium in which this is all playing out and the stadium in which the outcome of the
[2:50:24.780 --> 2:50:29.660]  game will be decided is the human mind.
[2:50:29.660 --> 2:50:30.660]  That's it.
[2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:36.180]  Because as I was saying, you can see the brain, so it's in this reality.
[2:50:36.180 --> 2:50:37.340]  So where's the mind?
[2:50:37.340 --> 2:50:42.020]  You can't see the mind just as you can't see Wi-Fi, but you know it's there.
[2:50:42.020 --> 2:50:48.260]  The mind is on the level that we directly interact with, with the brain, is an electromagnetic
[2:50:48.260 --> 2:50:49.980]  field.
[2:50:49.980 --> 2:50:55.260]  That's beyond the limits of visible light, human sight, but it's there.
[2:50:55.260 --> 2:50:58.660]  It's in another what you would call dimension.
[2:50:58.660 --> 2:51:07.060]  And people talk about a dimension of reality that is very close to this one.
[2:51:07.060 --> 2:51:12.940]  On the dial, and they call it the astral dimension, some people call it the fourth dimension.
[2:51:12.940 --> 2:51:18.300]  And in the lower levels of that fourth dimension, that lower levels of that astral dimension,
[2:51:18.300 --> 2:51:24.940]  which is very close in frequency terms to this world, that's where it's being orchestrated
[2:51:24.940 --> 2:51:28.500]  from as I go into a length in the trap.
[2:51:28.500 --> 2:51:35.300]  And you know, this is where these entities are that are orchestrating this global cult
[2:51:35.300 --> 2:51:39.580]  in the world of the scenes with people like Schwab and Gates and all the rest of them.
[2:51:39.580 --> 2:51:43.940]  Talk about the trap, the new book, and these entities.
[2:51:43.940 --> 2:51:53.700]  Well, once you realize, Alex, that this reality, this global conspiracy is ultimately being
[2:51:53.700 --> 2:52:02.260]  manipulated from this lower fourth dimension, lower astral dimension, then so much falls
[2:52:02.260 --> 2:52:04.380]  into place.
[2:52:04.380 --> 2:52:12.980]  Why do these people in the cult take part in Satanism and Satanic ritual?
[2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:15.380]  Because who are they interacting with?
[2:52:15.380 --> 2:52:18.300]  Because they are interacting with entities.
[2:52:18.300 --> 2:52:23.260]  I mean, these people may be mad, but they're not completely stupid.
[2:52:23.260 --> 2:52:29.700]  And they're interacting with these entities in this lower fourth, lower astral dimension
[2:52:29.700 --> 2:52:31.380]  from where all this is coming.
[2:52:31.380 --> 2:52:35.220]  So they do their rituals and they keep doing them.
[2:52:35.220 --> 2:52:43.540]  You know, you see when you look into this, I know you have over the years, that they're
[2:52:43.540 --> 2:52:48.820]  doing Babylonian rituals, they're doing Egyptian rituals now.
[2:52:48.820 --> 2:52:49.820]  Why?
[2:52:49.820 --> 2:52:50.820]  Why?
[2:52:50.820 --> 2:52:53.380]  Why are they doing ancient rituals now?
[2:52:53.380 --> 2:53:01.620]  Because those ancient rituals were specifically designed to create a vibrational environment
[2:53:01.620 --> 2:53:09.900]  which thins out the difference in frequency between this reality and this lower astral
[2:53:09.900 --> 2:53:10.900]  reality.
[2:53:10.900 --> 2:53:18.380]  And if you keep doing this in the same place over and over again, then it thins it out even
[2:53:18.380 --> 2:53:19.380]  more.
[2:53:19.380 --> 2:53:24.620]  They talk to people who've taken part in these rituals over the years, different parts of
[2:53:24.620 --> 2:53:30.260]  the world, because it's a global phenomenon, and they explain how these often hideous looking
[2:53:30.260 --> 2:53:38.100]  entities, often taking a reptilian form, not always, but often, slip into this reality
[2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:44.980]  during the ritual where these satanists and these super satanists, which is what the elite
[2:53:44.980 --> 2:53:48.620]  are, are interacting with them.
[2:53:48.620 --> 2:53:55.380]  And so that's what they're doing, that's what the rituals are for, to create this interaction.
[2:53:55.380 --> 2:53:59.020]  Now, what do satanists do also?
[2:53:59.020 --> 2:54:04.100]  They sacrifice kids, they sacrifice adults too, but they sacrifice kids.
[2:54:04.100 --> 2:54:06.980]  Why do they do that?
[2:54:06.980 --> 2:54:13.140]  Why did the ancients say in, you know, places like Central America and all over the world
[2:54:13.140 --> 2:54:23.380]  actually say Babylon, we are sacrificing young virgins, children or someone else to the gods.
[2:54:23.380 --> 2:54:24.380]  What does that mean?
[2:54:24.380 --> 2:54:26.020]  Why would they do that?
[2:54:26.020 --> 2:54:33.260]  Because you come back to the Matrix movie and the Morpheus character, and he's holding
[2:54:33.260 --> 2:54:39.340]  up a battery, and he says the machines have turned humans into one of these.
[2:54:39.340 --> 2:54:43.180]  In other words, a source of energy.
[2:54:43.180 --> 2:54:51.140]  Now these, in this lower astral dimension where all this is being orchestrated from,
[2:54:51.140 --> 2:54:57.540]  the vibration is very low and very slow, that's why they are what they are.
[2:54:57.540 --> 2:55:04.060]  That's why they are so what we would call evil, which I define as the absence of love.
[2:55:04.060 --> 2:55:13.460]  And so to absorb energy from another source, that energy has to be within the frequency
[2:55:13.460 --> 2:55:20.860]  band that these entities operate on, otherwise they can't absorb it, like two radio stations
[2:55:20.860 --> 2:55:24.380]  passing in the same space, but not interfering with each other.
[2:55:24.380 --> 2:55:31.340]  The energy they want is the energy, which is the energy of them, the energy of fear,
[2:55:31.340 --> 2:55:37.500]  the energy of terror, the energy of anxiety, of depression, all these low vibrational emotional
[2:55:37.500 --> 2:55:38.500]  human states.
[2:55:38.500 --> 2:55:40.380]  And that's what they wanted during the Cover Deal.
[2:55:40.380 --> 2:55:44.620]  Record suicide, record depression, families breaking up, people isolated, that's what
[2:55:44.620 --> 2:55:46.220]  they feed off of.
[2:55:46.220 --> 2:55:53.180]  Yes, and you know, fear of nuclear war, fear of not having enough food, fear of the price
[2:55:53.180 --> 2:56:00.780]  of energy, all these things, you take a world war, it's a bloody banquet to these entities
[2:56:00.780 --> 2:56:08.340]  because of all the emotional charge that goes into fighting the war, all the emotional charge
[2:56:08.340 --> 2:56:12.580]  from people back home who are terrified that their loved one is not going to come home.
[2:56:12.580 --> 2:56:16.540]  So it's interdimensional transference of psychic energy?
[2:56:16.540 --> 2:56:19.900]  Of energy, yeah, of emotional energy.
[2:56:19.900 --> 2:56:28.900]  And so they've set up this reality to generate maximum amounts of low vibrational emotional
[2:56:28.900 --> 2:56:33.540]  energy, of course, they've done it very well, and they are then feeding off this energy
[2:56:33.540 --> 2:56:35.860]  and it's empowering them.
[2:56:35.860 --> 2:56:43.740]  They don't want people getting on, they don't want people loving each other, they don't
[2:56:43.740 --> 2:56:50.660]  want people having joy and happiness and contentment, because these are high, these are high frequency
[2:56:50.660 --> 2:56:51.660]  energies.
[2:56:51.660 --> 2:56:57.060]  For instance, when you're in a low frequency state, a low emotional state, let's put it
[2:56:57.060 --> 2:57:00.340]  that way, but it's a low frequency state, in other words.
[2:57:00.340 --> 2:57:06.300]  People say things like, I feel so heavy today, why is that?
[2:57:06.300 --> 2:57:14.980]  Because that state of perception emotion is generating these low, slow frequencies.
[2:57:14.980 --> 2:57:20.460]  And studies are now showing that electromagnetic, artificial 5G and other systems are actually
[2:57:20.460 --> 2:57:26.660]  making people depressed, so they're artificially putting us into that, that type of system.
[2:57:26.660 --> 2:57:29.780]  I forget the name, but the cruise, sorry, go ahead.
[2:57:29.780 --> 2:57:34.020]  Good, and this is why, this is the point, this is why they're doing it.
[2:57:34.020 --> 2:57:42.300]  So when you are generating these low, slow frequencies through a low emotional state
[2:57:42.300 --> 2:57:48.620]  or they're coming the other way, it's our best seller.
[2:57:48.620 --> 2:57:53.300]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller, but as folks tried
[2:57:53.300 --> 2:57:57.900]  vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made
[2:57:57.900 --> 2:58:00.980]  them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[2:58:00.980 --> 2:58:04.380]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[2:58:04.380 --> 2:58:09.820]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[2:58:09.820 --> 2:58:10.820]  function of the body.
[2:58:10.820 --> 2:58:15.620]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[2:58:15.620 --> 2:58:18.180]  need to live and be healthy.
[2:58:18.180 --> 2:58:20.460]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[2:58:20.460 --> 2:58:24.540]  Because so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is
[2:58:24.540 --> 2:58:28.460]  critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[2:58:28.460 --> 2:58:31.980]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[2:58:31.980 --> 2:58:35.500]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[2:58:35.500 --> 2:58:39.660]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally
[2:58:39.660 --> 2:58:43.420]  back in stock at infowarstore.com for a 50% off.
[2:58:43.420 --> 2:58:46.780]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[2:58:46.780 --> 2:58:51.580]  Think about a world without info wars.
[2:58:51.580 --> 2:58:55.900]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[2:58:55.900 --> 2:58:58.100]  and stories we've broken together.
[2:58:58.100 --> 2:59:01.180]  This family that is info wars.
[2:59:01.180 --> 2:59:06.500]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other
[2:59:06.500 --> 2:59:14.060]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[2:59:14.060 --> 2:59:17.260]  base to defeat the new world order.
[2:59:17.260 --> 2:59:23.020]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[2:59:23.020 --> 2:59:27.500]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:59:27.500 --> 2:59:31.100]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit.
[2:59:31.100 --> 2:59:35.460]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[2:59:35.460 --> 2:59:37.220]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[2:59:37.220 --> 2:59:48.220]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[2:59:48.220 --> 3:00:00.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:00.460 --> 3:00:07.140]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:00:07.140 --> 3:00:11.220]  the info war.
[3:00:11.220 --> 3:00:16.700]  Happiness and contentment, because these are high, these are high-frequency energies.
[3:00:16.700 --> 3:00:22.140]  For instance, when you're in a low-frequency state, a low-emotional state, let's put it
[3:00:22.140 --> 3:00:25.420]  that way, but it's a low-frequency state in other words.
[3:00:25.420 --> 3:00:31.380]  People say things like, I feel so heavy today, why is that?
[3:00:31.380 --> 3:00:39.300]  Because that state of perception emotion is generating these low-sum frequencies.
[3:00:39.300 --> 3:00:44.780]  And studies are now showing that electromagnetic, artificial 5G and others are actually making
[3:00:44.780 --> 3:00:50.660]  people depressed, so they're artificially putting us into that type of system.
[3:00:50.660 --> 3:00:53.740]  I forget the name, but the crews, sorry, go ahead.
[3:00:53.740 --> 3:00:58.060]  And this is why, this is the point, this is why they're doing it.
[3:00:58.060 --> 3:01:06.220]  So when you are generating these low-slow frequencies through a low-emotional state,
[3:01:06.220 --> 3:01:13.700]  or they're coming the other way through this cloud and these low-orbit satellites and towers,
[3:01:13.700 --> 3:01:20.260]  then the energy, the frequencies going through your energetic field are low and slow.
[3:01:20.260 --> 3:01:26.580]  And so when that happens, the field gets denser and you feel this, oh, I feel so heavy.
[3:01:26.580 --> 3:01:35.300]  But when you feel joy and love and happiness, life's great, then they are high, fast frequencies
[3:01:35.300 --> 3:01:39.820]  that are generated from those emotional and perceptual states.
[3:01:39.820 --> 3:01:45.700]  And so they go through your energetic field and they vibrate it very quickly and it becomes
[3:01:45.700 --> 3:01:47.300]  lighter.
[3:01:47.300 --> 3:01:51.780]  So people say, I feel so light today because I feel so good.
[3:01:51.780 --> 3:01:56.060]  So it's at this level, you see, and this is the other thing, I've done this in some of
[3:01:56.060 --> 3:02:05.740]  my books, but I think it was in the 1950s that a guy studied the frequencies of different
[3:02:05.740 --> 3:02:11.620]  emotional states and actually listed what they were.
[3:02:11.620 --> 3:02:19.500]  And this is the point that we've already introduced, that yes, you can feel an emotional state
[3:02:19.500 --> 3:02:25.780]  and generate the frequency, but if the frequency relating to that emotional state is coming
[3:02:25.780 --> 3:02:30.740]  the other way through this bloody cloud, then the throttle goes both ways.
[3:02:30.740 --> 3:02:34.220]  And that's how all this mainstream television watching literally is causing Alzheimer's
[3:02:34.220 --> 3:02:35.720]  and killing people.
[3:02:35.720 --> 3:02:39.020]  Let me raise this point, David.
[3:02:39.020 --> 3:02:43.620]  How is this operation by this force running?
[3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:44.620]  How is there war?
[3:02:44.620 --> 3:02:46.660]  Because I asked you earlier, you said we're at crossroads.
[3:02:46.660 --> 3:02:47.660]  I agree.
[3:02:47.660 --> 3:02:48.660]  And how do we transcend it?
[3:02:48.660 --> 3:02:52.780]  Because as an example, certainly we see limited reality, but at one point in the universe
[3:02:52.780 --> 3:02:56.460]  of the dimensions, we're seeing what I believe is a limited layer of it or what you call
[3:02:56.460 --> 3:02:58.940]  a simulation, but at least something tangible.
[3:02:58.940 --> 3:03:02.180]  Why in literally, as you know, thousands of studies, people don't need studies to know
[3:03:02.180 --> 3:03:06.380]  this, you go swimming in the Caribbean or the Mediterranean, you go out of the stars
[3:03:06.380 --> 3:03:12.060]  at night with the moon with your friends and laugh and tell jokes by a fire, you walk through
[3:03:12.060 --> 3:03:16.580]  the forest or the fields and you feel light and empowered and connected to the universe
[3:03:16.580 --> 3:03:18.740]  and God and the infinite.
[3:03:18.740 --> 3:03:23.700]  But then when you go and plug into the VR matrix, you feel nauseous, you feel sick, you
[3:03:23.700 --> 3:03:26.700]  feel depressed, you have nightmares, you don't sleep well.
[3:03:26.700 --> 3:03:32.980]  What is it about being out in nature that counteracts this?
[3:03:32.980 --> 3:03:39.340]  Well, what they're seeking to do is to negate that.
[3:03:39.340 --> 3:03:46.220]  See, at the moment, if you're in a city, I mean, China is the blueprint, obviously.
[3:03:46.220 --> 3:03:55.580]  You are bombarded with technologically generated electromagnetic fields that are designed to
[3:03:55.580 --> 3:03:59.300]  put you in these low vibrational states.
[3:03:59.300 --> 3:04:03.660]  But up to this point, you've been able to get out of there, get out.
[3:04:03.660 --> 3:04:09.460]  I mean, I talk about nature in a different way, but you can get away from that, you get
[3:04:09.460 --> 3:04:16.980]  out into the areas that are not subject to that bombardment and therefore, I mean, these
[3:04:16.980 --> 3:04:22.980]  people that have this electro sensitivity where they're so sensitive to electromagnetic
[3:04:22.980 --> 3:04:29.420]  fields generated technologically that they become very, very sick and they have to go
[3:04:29.420 --> 3:04:34.420]  and live in caravans in the forest to get away from it because that's the only place
[3:04:34.420 --> 3:04:37.420]  that they don't feel sick.
[3:04:37.420 --> 3:04:43.180]  You have this, you know, this building syndrome where people get the same thing, where they
[3:04:43.180 --> 3:04:46.420]  work in an office surrounded by these bomb-bodied bodies.
[3:04:46.420 --> 3:04:47.420]  Sure.
[3:04:47.420 --> 3:04:48.420]  What about the Havana syndrome?
[3:04:48.420 --> 3:04:53.820]  Even the top is more than 20 CIA scientists sent in who didn't think it was real.
[3:04:53.820 --> 3:04:55.940]  They're getting nauseous and super sick now.
[3:04:55.940 --> 3:05:02.020]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's
[3:05:02.020 --> 3:05:06.500]  on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to
[3:05:06.500 --> 3:05:09.220]  their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[3:05:09.220 --> 3:05:12.820]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[3:05:12.820 --> 3:05:17.540]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[3:05:17.540 --> 3:05:21.500]  don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[3:05:21.500 --> 3:05:23.580]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[3:05:23.580 --> 3:05:29.980]  I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from m4short.com,
[3:05:29.980 --> 3:05:33.300]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[3:05:33.300 --> 3:05:37.980]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible.
[3:05:37.980 --> 3:05:44.780]  And despite the fact that it's selling out, X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at m4short.com.
[3:05:44.780 --> 3:05:47.380]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[3:05:47.380 --> 3:05:48.380]  We're not selling it for that.
[3:05:48.380 --> 3:05:52.140]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[3:05:52.140 --> 3:05:57.020]  Get X3 today, 50% off at m4short.com all supplies last.
[3:05:57.020 --> 3:06:05.380]  Well, here we are on the unbattled Alex Jones broadcast on this Friday, October 14th worldwide
[3:06:05.380 --> 3:06:06.380]  transmission.
[3:06:06.380 --> 3:06:10.140]  We are now well into the amazing David Ike interview.
[3:06:10.140 --> 3:06:16.220]  If you'd like to see it commercial free or without the regular radio and TV ads programmed
[3:06:16.220 --> 3:06:22.180]  in, it'll be posted very soon at band.video later this afternoon.
[3:06:22.180 --> 3:06:26.580]  David's talking about the nature of reality getting outside the box and realizing the
[3:06:26.580 --> 3:06:29.260]  globalist are not in total control.
[3:06:29.260 --> 3:06:34.300]  If we decide to be in control and then act collectively as individuals together, we are
[3:06:34.300 --> 3:06:36.300]  unstoppable.
[3:06:36.300 --> 3:06:42.420]  And just remember, folks around the world, not just in the U.S., are rallying the m4short
[3:06:42.420 --> 3:06:46.900]  support right now because they saw how when we got deplatformed four years ago, that was
[3:06:46.900 --> 3:06:49.580]  then used as the model and serve everybody else.
[3:06:49.580 --> 3:06:52.180]  And so finally, people are really getting it.
[3:06:52.180 --> 3:06:55.740]  And quite frankly, all this persecution has been a blessing.
[3:06:55.740 --> 3:06:59.420]  If they can't convince us to give up, if they can't convince us they're winning and
[3:06:59.420 --> 3:07:03.820]  they're in the wrong, and if they can't play a mind trick, a Jedi mind trick to make us
[3:07:03.820 --> 3:07:07.540]  believe their propaganda, it's game over for them.
[3:07:07.540 --> 3:07:09.900]  It is the Emperor's new clothes.
[3:07:09.900 --> 3:07:12.860]  It is the Wizard of Oz and the man behind the curtain.
[3:07:12.860 --> 3:07:18.980]  So let's go back here in the fourth hour to most of the rest of the David Ike interview.
[3:07:18.980 --> 3:07:23.300]  And then again, there's about 20 minutes or so we won't get to that'll be posted again
[3:07:23.300 --> 3:07:28.420]  in full, but the 20 minutes you miss at band.video a little bit later this afternoon.
[3:07:28.420 --> 3:07:31.260]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:07:31.260 --> 3:07:32.420]  We've seen an outpouring.
[3:07:32.420 --> 3:07:37.820]  We were back in the red in the last month, treading water to fund payroll and ban went
[3:07:37.820 --> 3:07:39.900]  and legal and everything.
[3:07:39.900 --> 3:07:44.420]  And now because of these evil judgments in the in the Kangaroo Court, we've seen massive
[3:07:44.420 --> 3:07:48.140]  outpouring that has almost pushed us back into the black.
[3:07:48.140 --> 3:07:52.140]  So if you'll just go to saveinfullwords.com for my personal legal fees, if you want to
[3:07:52.140 --> 3:07:55.460]  help me because I'm running out of money, not going to pay 40% of the fees in these
[3:07:55.460 --> 3:07:59.780]  legal cases, according to bankruptcy court, and I'm following that, go to saveinfullwords.com.
[3:07:59.780 --> 3:08:03.020]  I'm very thankful and humble and I appreciate you.
[3:08:03.020 --> 3:08:07.740]  And I encourage those that happen to make a donation was $5, $10, whatever you can.
[3:08:07.740 --> 3:08:13.260]  I really appreciate it and your freedom will appreciate as well at saveinfullwords.com.
[3:08:13.260 --> 3:08:16.500]  But whatever you do, get the amazing products that are so incredible.
[3:08:16.500 --> 3:08:21.140]  There's global runs on iodine all over the world as people are figuring out how important
[3:08:21.140 --> 3:08:22.140]  it is.
[3:08:22.140 --> 3:08:23.140]  We've got the very, very best.
[3:08:23.140 --> 3:08:25.380]  Here's the headline.
[3:08:25.380 --> 3:08:30.140]  Why the war in Ukraine has country stockpiling iodine tablets?
[3:08:30.140 --> 3:08:34.460]  That is out of LA Times.
[3:08:34.460 --> 3:08:36.740]  I talked about it some in the first hour.
[3:08:36.740 --> 3:08:38.820]  So these are some of the big issues going on.
[3:08:38.820 --> 3:08:40.420]  We don't sell it for nuclear war.
[3:08:40.420 --> 3:08:44.420]  We sell it because it's so powerful for what it does for everything else in your body,
[3:08:44.420 --> 3:08:49.420]  including your energy, your libido, but more importantly, your immune system.
[3:08:49.420 --> 3:08:55.420]  X3 in stock, 60% off at infowarstore.com, even though it's selling out, we're keeping
[3:08:55.420 --> 3:08:59.340]  it at that price with promo code 1776.
[3:08:59.340 --> 3:09:04.140]  All you do is put that number in and instead of 50% off, you get 60% off and double patriot
[3:09:04.140 --> 3:09:09.700]  points on X3, vitamin refuge, your DNA force, and so many other products right now, the
[3:09:09.700 --> 3:09:13.700]  biggest sell of the year that's extended and expanded at infowarstore.com.
[3:09:13.700 --> 3:09:19.220]  All right, let's go back to the rest of the incredible David Ike interview.
[3:09:19.220 --> 3:09:24.140]  I think it's their own devices and their own systems and what they've tied into is physically
[3:09:24.140 --> 3:09:28.220]  making them ill and they think it's the Russians or the Chinese.
[3:09:28.220 --> 3:09:34.060]  Well, you know, it could be any source of generating the electromagnetic field.
[3:09:34.060 --> 3:09:39.220]  So these satellites that are going up through people like Musk who's looking at 42,000,
[3:09:39.220 --> 3:09:46.460]  well, I say eventually, that's the number being given now, they're seeking to take
[3:09:46.460 --> 3:09:54.740]  out or generate these fields and 5G and what follows to every inch of the planet and they
[3:09:54.740 --> 3:10:00.300]  need to do that in their agenda because they want to connect, not least through what's
[3:10:00.300 --> 3:10:06.420]  going into people with these fake vaccines and of course, these fake vaccines are planned
[3:10:06.420 --> 3:10:13.540]  to be transferred to every other vaccine and any other ones that they can justify and come
[3:10:13.540 --> 3:10:21.260]  up with with their excuses and therefore, if they're going to connect every human to
[3:10:21.260 --> 3:10:26.380]  artificial intelligence via the cloud, as they call it, then they have to hit every
[3:10:26.380 --> 3:10:31.260]  inch of the planet with absolutely David, the time we've got the time we've got left,
[3:10:31.260 --> 3:10:34.140]  I want to move through a lot of the current things that are folding and happening.
[3:10:34.140 --> 3:10:40.140]  But since you mentioned this, in the 1960s, there was an episode day of the dove and Star
[3:10:40.140 --> 3:10:46.140]  Trek where an energy sucking vampire has come on board interdimensionally on the ship and
[3:10:46.140 --> 3:10:50.660]  it's playing the Klingons off against the humans and the humans off against each other
[3:10:50.660 --> 3:10:54.940]  and as soon as they figure that out and become positive and loving, it dissipates, it makes
[3:10:54.940 --> 3:10:55.940]  it go away.
[3:10:55.940 --> 3:11:21.940]  Let's play a clip from Day of the Dove.
[3:11:21.940 --> 3:11:35.620]  What are you doing here?
[3:11:35.620 --> 3:11:39.060]  You're boarding for duty, sir.
[3:11:39.060 --> 3:11:40.060]  Duty?
[3:11:40.060 --> 3:11:41.860]  Look, I'll release you from sick pain.
[3:11:41.860 --> 3:11:42.860]  I'll release myself.
[3:11:42.860 --> 3:11:43.860]  And get back to sick pain.
[3:11:43.860 --> 3:11:44.860]  Now in your life, sir.
[3:11:44.860 --> 3:11:45.860]  I'm fitting ready for action.
[3:11:45.860 --> 3:11:49.620]  Klingons almost hit me at once and I'm not even a score.
[3:11:49.620 --> 3:11:50.620]  I order you to get back.
[3:11:50.620 --> 3:11:51.620]  I've got my orders.
[3:11:51.620 --> 3:11:55.820]  Kill the Klingons, stab them or ask those nips.
[3:11:55.820 --> 3:12:08.420]  And so then they figure out that it's manipulating their emotions.
[3:12:08.420 --> 3:12:13.880]  During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and loss for vengeance,
[3:12:13.880 --> 3:12:17.500]  the alien's life energy level increased.
[3:12:17.500 --> 3:12:22.140]  And the lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy.
[3:12:22.140 --> 3:12:25.980]  It subsists on the emotions of others.
[3:12:25.980 --> 3:12:34.940]  This one appears to be strengthened by mental radiations of hostility, violent intentions.
[3:12:34.940 --> 3:12:39.980]  It exists on the hate of others.
[3:12:39.980 --> 3:12:46.500]  To put it simply, and it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation in order to satisfy
[3:12:46.500 --> 3:12:47.500]  that need.
[3:12:47.500 --> 3:12:53.380]  It has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments, in an effort to promote
[3:12:53.380 --> 3:12:56.460]  the most violent mode of conflict.
[3:12:56.460 --> 3:13:03.180]  And kept numbers and resources balanced so that it can maintain a constant state of
[3:13:03.180 --> 3:13:04.180]  violence.
[3:13:04.180 --> 3:13:08.300]  It's got to have a vulnerable area.
[3:13:08.300 --> 3:13:09.860]  We've got to get rid of it.
[3:13:09.860 --> 3:13:13.540]  Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated.
[3:13:13.540 --> 3:13:15.180]  The fighting must end.
[3:13:15.180 --> 3:13:16.180]  And soon.
[3:13:16.180 --> 3:13:25.100]  A doomed ship traveling forever between galaxies filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare.
[3:13:25.100 --> 3:13:27.540]  Kang has got to listen.
[3:13:27.540 --> 3:13:39.020]  We've got to pull our knowledge and get rid of this thing.
[3:13:39.020 --> 3:13:40.020]  Almost over.
[3:13:40.020 --> 3:13:41.020]  We'll be back to David.
[3:13:41.020 --> 3:13:42.020]  This is important, though.
[3:13:42.020 --> 3:14:05.940]  This is Captain Kirk, a truce is ordered, the fighting is over, lay down your weapons.
[3:14:05.940 --> 3:14:22.060]  This is Kang, cease hostilities, disarm.
[3:14:22.060 --> 3:14:26.340]  The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain, and I suggest that good
[3:14:26.340 --> 3:14:39.580]  spirits might make an effective weapon.
[3:14:39.580 --> 3:14:40.580]  Get off my ship.
[3:14:40.580 --> 3:14:48.260]  You're a dead duck, you're powerless, we know about you, and we don't want to play.
[3:14:48.260 --> 3:14:54.980]  Maybe there are others like you around, maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of
[3:14:54.980 --> 3:14:56.980]  history, but that's all over.
[3:14:56.980 --> 3:15:00.980]  We'll be on guard now, we'll be ready for you, so ship out.
[3:15:00.980 --> 3:15:01.980]  Come on, hold it.
[3:15:01.980 --> 3:15:02.980]  Out already.
[3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:03.980]  Out.
[3:15:03.980 --> 3:15:04.980]  We need no urging to hate humans.
[3:15:04.980 --> 3:15:16.980]  For the present, only a fool fights in a burning house.
[3:15:16.980 --> 3:15:17.980]  Out.
[3:15:17.980 --> 3:15:26.980]  All right, so that's a little long clip, but they knew what they were doing when they wrote
[3:15:26.980 --> 3:15:29.980]  that back in the late 1960s.
[3:15:29.980 --> 3:15:30.980]  David, I could take on that.
[3:15:30.980 --> 3:15:33.780]  Well, I thought that was fantastic, mate.
[3:15:33.780 --> 3:15:39.980]  I mean, it just encapsulated, you know, what I've just been saying, and this is the thing.
[3:15:39.980 --> 3:15:47.980]  They don't care what we fight about, what we hate each other about, and what we abuse
[3:15:47.980 --> 3:15:49.300]  each other about.
[3:15:49.300 --> 3:15:57.380]  What they care about is that we do all those things.
[3:15:57.380 --> 3:16:02.300]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[3:16:02.300 --> 3:16:07.980]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but to the
[3:16:07.980 --> 3:16:08.980]  world.
[3:16:08.980 --> 3:16:14.380]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[3:16:14.380 --> 3:16:15.380]  deserve the credit.
[3:16:15.380 --> 3:16:20.300]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them forward are the real
[3:16:20.300 --> 3:16:22.860]  reason you've had the success.
[3:16:22.860 --> 3:16:27.580]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever
[3:16:27.580 --> 3:16:28.580]  had.
[3:16:28.580 --> 3:16:34.980]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important
[3:16:34.980 --> 3:16:38.980]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight, and to continue in the
[3:16:38.980 --> 3:16:41.780]  efforts you've been carrying out, and to intensify them.
[3:16:41.780 --> 3:16:42.780]  God bless you all.
[3:16:42.780 --> 3:16:43.780]  I salute you.
[3:16:43.780 --> 3:16:48.900]  I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the
[3:16:48.900 --> 3:16:50.980]  target, and history is happening.
[3:16:50.980 --> 3:16:52.660]  The fight is my fight.
[3:16:52.660 --> 3:16:53.660]  It's your fight.
[3:16:53.660 --> 3:16:54.660]  It's our fight.
[3:16:54.660 --> 3:16:56.340]  God bless you all.
[3:16:56.340 --> 3:17:01.140]  Think about a world without info wars.
[3:17:01.140 --> 3:17:05.460]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[3:17:05.460 --> 3:17:10.780]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[3:17:10.780 --> 3:17:15.900]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[3:17:15.900 --> 3:17:23.380]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[3:17:23.380 --> 3:17:26.900]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[3:17:26.900 --> 3:17:32.640]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[3:17:32.640 --> 3:17:37.140]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[3:17:37.140 --> 3:17:38.860]  I don't take the credit.
[3:17:38.860 --> 3:17:40.700]  I give you the credit.
[3:17:40.700 --> 3:17:45.100]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[3:17:45.100 --> 3:17:46.860]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[3:17:46.860 --> 3:17:50.260]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.

[3:17:56.380 --> 3:17:58.740]  Cloride is the enemy.
[3:17:58.740 --> 3:18:04.220]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[3:18:04.220 --> 3:18:05.900]  What's the good halogen?
[3:18:05.900 --> 3:18:08.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[3:19:56.980 --> 3:20:07.460]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.460 --> 3:20:12.500]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:12.500 --> 3:20:17.180]  They're not bothered about why as long as we do them.
[3:20:17.180 --> 3:20:21.620]  Notice the point is made that it equalizes the forces to keep it going forever.
[3:20:21.620 --> 3:20:22.620]  It's an energy transference.
[3:20:22.620 --> 3:20:28.500]  Yeah, well this is a point I've made in the books over the years.
[3:20:28.500 --> 3:20:31.940]  This is why I say we don't need to fight.
[3:20:31.940 --> 3:20:35.500]  The last thing we do is fight this force.
[3:20:35.500 --> 3:20:42.700]  What we do is cease to cooperate with it and one way we cooperate with it is the fight.
[3:20:42.700 --> 3:20:50.740]  So if you've got an electrical circuit, you need two polarities and the electrical charge
[3:20:50.740 --> 3:20:52.500]  goes between them.
[3:20:52.500 --> 3:21:01.340]  So when you refuse to take part, then that force which wants to set up an electrical
[3:21:01.340 --> 3:21:10.220]  interaction with you, so it vampires your energy, suddenly it's one hand clapping.
[3:21:10.220 --> 3:21:15.140]  It's got no way of setting up that connection because you're not having it.
[3:21:15.140 --> 3:21:17.060]  You don't want to fight it.
[3:21:17.060 --> 3:21:22.460]  What you want to do is cease to cooperate with it and that's why the power of none
[3:21:22.460 --> 3:21:25.140]  know is so fundamental.
[3:21:25.140 --> 3:21:28.420]  The power of know has ended every tyranny in history.
[3:21:28.420 --> 3:21:33.660]  The power of know says I can see what you're doing.
[3:21:33.660 --> 3:21:37.980]  I can see why you're doing it and I'm not playing your game.
[3:21:37.980 --> 3:21:40.180]  I'm not being a pawn in your game.
[3:21:40.180 --> 3:21:41.540]  I'm not having it.
[3:21:41.540 --> 3:21:52.420]  So if you look at the COVID period, if people had said no to house arrest, so-called lockdown,
[3:21:52.420 --> 3:21:58.300]  if they had said no to social distancing, if no to masks, none of that could have been
[3:21:58.300 --> 3:21:59.300]  enforced.
[3:21:59.300 --> 3:22:04.100]  David, I want to go there and talk about the fact that people did submit in Australia
[3:22:04.100 --> 3:22:07.540]  and the UK and the US to some extent, but they woke up, now the pendulum is swinging
[3:22:07.540 --> 3:22:12.260]  back, 1% of who was taking the Pfizer-Bodernas shots according to a study that came out last
[3:22:12.260 --> 3:22:13.780]  month are taking it now.
[3:22:13.780 --> 3:22:15.780]  So people are really rejecting it in mass.
[3:22:15.780 --> 3:22:19.380]  It takes people a while, yes, you're vindicated, I'm vindicated, our viewers and listeners
[3:22:19.380 --> 3:22:23.700]  are those rallies you have with hundreds of thousands, the rallies Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[3:22:23.700 --> 3:22:24.700]  had with millions.
[3:22:24.700 --> 3:22:28.140]  I see this as an awakening, but you're right, now they're coming for the kids.
[3:22:28.140 --> 3:22:33.020]  I want to speak to that, but since you talk about how they're manipulating us and taking
[3:22:33.020 --> 3:22:37.260]  off our energy, here's Julian Assange, now many years ago, before he got arrested or
[3:22:37.260 --> 3:22:42.020]  put on house arrest, explaining the goal of these wars, like Vietnam or Ukraine, is to
[3:22:42.020 --> 3:22:43.020]  be endless.
[3:22:43.020 --> 3:22:45.020]  Here it is.
[3:22:45.020 --> 3:22:51.260]  Because the goal is not to completely subjugate Afghanistan, the goal is to use Afghanistan
[3:22:51.260 --> 3:22:58.140]  to wash money out of the tax bases of the United States, out of the tax bases of European
[3:22:58.140 --> 3:23:04.300]  countries through Afghanistan and back into the hands of a transnational security elite.
[3:23:04.300 --> 3:23:11.860]  That is the goal, i.e. the goal is to have an endless war, not a successful war.
[3:23:11.860 --> 3:23:16.580]  But it's bigger than that, it's energetic at the end of the day, so David, spend a few
[3:23:16.580 --> 3:23:19.220]  minutes just on the temporal level of this dimension for us.
[3:23:19.220 --> 3:23:23.500]  We know you're really teaching us a lot here, but specifically the last two and a half years
[3:23:23.500 --> 3:23:29.580]  of hell, the euthanizing people here and in your country, the lockdowns, the police dogs,
[3:23:29.580 --> 3:23:33.700]  the people being put in jail, the quarantines, that helped build their emergency infrastructure
[3:23:33.700 --> 3:23:34.700]  that's still there.
[3:23:34.700 --> 3:23:37.500]  We know they're going to come back soon, I want your take on how that happens, but it
[3:23:37.500 --> 3:23:42.140]  does look like they wanted to keep lockdowns going longer, control longer, and that there
[3:23:42.140 --> 3:23:46.980]  was a massive rejection, so when they saw the crescendo of resistance building that
[3:23:46.980 --> 3:23:50.980]  would have been a chain reaction to take us over the top, they backed off at least for
[3:23:50.980 --> 3:23:56.620]  a little while, so your description of coming out that you're way more likely in studies
[3:23:56.620 --> 3:23:59.980]  to die of COVID or get COVID if you have the shot, that it doesn't work, that it erases
[3:23:59.980 --> 3:24:05.100]  your immune system, that it is confirmed to be building some type of nanotech matrix
[3:24:05.100 --> 3:24:06.100]  in people.
[3:24:06.100 --> 3:24:10.940]  This is part of something big, what is it, how did it go, and what do you see them getting
[3:24:10.940 --> 3:24:13.060]  ready to hit us with the next?
[3:24:13.060 --> 3:24:21.180]  Well, what they're doing, Alex, is going through their agenda for the human body.
[3:24:21.180 --> 3:24:28.980]  Like I said, it's an anti-human agenda, and they're moving from human 1.0, the biological
[3:24:28.980 --> 3:24:36.900]  body as we call it, to human 2.0, which is a far more synthetic body, and this was described
[3:24:36.900 --> 3:24:45.100]  by Elder Sluxley in Brave New World, and this new human is not meant to procreate, it's
[3:24:45.100 --> 3:24:50.020]  meant to be produced technologically, which is what Sluxley was talking about in world
[3:24:50.020 --> 3:24:55.900]  state hatcheries, and he said that with the world state hatcheries and the production
[3:24:55.900 --> 3:25:04.700]  of the human species by technology, that would be the end of parenthood.
[3:25:04.700 --> 3:25:10.340]  So from that comes an enormous number of dots to connect.
[3:25:10.340 --> 3:25:16.580]  First of all, the end of parenthood, that's why in Europe and America, Canada, and so
[3:25:16.580 --> 3:25:25.060]  on, you're seeing the influence and ability to make decisions by parents about their children
[3:25:25.060 --> 3:25:29.420]  being completely and utterly erased.
[3:25:29.420 --> 3:25:31.540]  Why are they doing that?
[3:25:31.540 --> 3:25:36.580]  Because they're preparing for this no-parent society.
[3:25:36.580 --> 3:25:44.620]  Now, if you don't need parents to procreate, you don't need men and you don't need women,
[3:25:44.620 --> 3:25:53.980]  and so we had the toxic masculinity agenda where men started to be and continue to be
[3:25:53.980 --> 3:26:01.540]  abused and marginalized and attacked, and I said when that started, Alex, they're coming
[3:26:01.540 --> 3:26:08.140]  for the women next because they don't need men and women in this Brave New World of the
[3:26:08.140 --> 3:26:18.900]  human 2.0 to procreate, and so they're now going for the women, and the dominant force
[3:26:18.900 --> 3:26:25.700]  now in the hierarchy of political correctness is transgender.
[3:26:25.700 --> 3:26:28.340]  So where does transgender come from?
[3:26:28.340 --> 3:26:32.100]  Why did it come out of nowhere and it was suddenly everywhere?
[3:26:32.100 --> 3:26:38.100]  Why are they targeting the children in this extraordinarily extreme, blatant, in-your-face
[3:26:38.100 --> 3:26:41.660]  manner with the drag queens and so on?
[3:26:41.660 --> 3:26:49.220]  They're doing it because on the road to fusing gender, because this new human is meant not
[3:26:49.220 --> 3:26:58.140]  to be male or female, is no need for it to be because you are not procreating anymore.
[3:26:58.140 --> 3:27:03.900]  You have to, on the way to fusing gender, you have to confuse gender.
[3:27:03.900 --> 3:27:12.300]  You have to take out the basics in the perception of the population of what gender is, not male
[3:27:12.300 --> 3:27:13.300]  or female.
[3:27:13.300 --> 3:27:18.740]  You have to scramble that whole perception, and they are doing these horrific things to
[3:27:18.740 --> 3:27:24.620]  children both perceptually and literally with the surgery and the drugs and the castration
[3:27:24.620 --> 3:27:31.460]  of young kids on the road to totally scrambling the perception of gender on the road to the
[3:27:31.460 --> 3:27:32.460]  no-gender human.
[3:27:32.460 --> 3:27:42.140]  And the no-gender human, as Huxley described, would be produced in casts, and these casts
[3:27:42.140 --> 3:27:51.420]  would be genetic casts, actually synthetic genetic casts, which would have different
[3:27:51.420 --> 3:27:52.420]  abilities.
[3:27:52.420 --> 3:27:54.300]  We come back to what we were talking about earlier.
[3:27:54.300 --> 3:28:00.380]  They'd have different abilities to process information into a perception, into a conclusion,
[3:28:00.380 --> 3:28:02.820]  into an action or behavior.
[3:28:02.820 --> 3:28:14.300]  So the worker cast would be unable to process information, thus understand any information
[3:28:14.300 --> 3:28:17.860]  beyond their ability to serve as the worker cast.
[3:28:17.860 --> 3:28:19.940]  And to back you up, Huxley wrote that in 31.
[3:28:19.940 --> 3:28:23.380]  His brother was a head transhumanist who ran the UN.
[3:28:23.380 --> 3:28:27.340]  He said in a speech in 61 in his book, Brave New World Revisited, that this was an actual
[3:28:27.340 --> 3:28:32.460]  plan of the elites, and as you know, he was part of that British breeding program, eugenics
[3:28:32.460 --> 3:28:33.460]  program himself.
[3:28:33.460 --> 3:28:42.700]  Yeah, I mean, his brother was a eugenicist, I mean, quite obviously, and of course he
[3:28:42.700 --> 3:28:49.460]  would be involved in the UN, which is a front for this cult to justify and to stepping stone
[3:28:49.460 --> 3:28:58.180]  towards total global control by the will of God.
[3:28:58.180 --> 3:29:03.420]  And by God working through you and your support, info wars continues to persevere against the
[3:29:03.420 --> 3:29:07.740]  tax never before seen in the Western world against independent media.
[3:29:07.740 --> 3:29:08.740]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.

[3:29:16.940 --> 3:29:21.220]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.

[3:29:55.700 --> 3:30:01.020]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a coworker that's on
[3:30:01.020 --> 3:30:05.500]  drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their
[3:30:05.500 --> 3:30:08.060]  aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[3:30:08.060 --> 3:30:11.660]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[3:30:11.660 --> 3:30:16.380]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[3:30:16.380 --> 3:30:20.340]  don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[3:30:20.340 --> 3:30:22.420]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.

[3:32:56.860 --> 3:33:14.900]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:14.900 --> 3:33:36.980]  So these really are just human alien collaborators with a center dimensional force.
[3:33:36.980 --> 3:33:39.620]  I mean, the Bible tells us that everything, this is really it.
[3:33:39.620 --> 3:33:41.940]  They're building a post human world, building a nightmare.
[3:33:41.940 --> 3:33:45.140]  They see us as lab rats, David, you've been vindicated.
[3:33:45.140 --> 3:33:50.060]  Well, again, what I find interesting, what I found interesting over the years as I researched
[3:33:50.060 --> 3:33:56.700]  this, Alex, is that, you know, we look at the different religions and so on.
[3:33:56.700 --> 3:34:05.820]  And what strikes me is not how the religions differ from each other, but actually the common
[3:34:05.820 --> 3:34:07.540]  themes.
[3:34:07.540 --> 3:34:11.140]  So I looked at the Christian belief in demons.
[3:34:11.140 --> 3:34:17.740]  I looked at the whole, you know, demonic realm as Christians describe it.
[3:34:17.740 --> 3:34:20.060]  I looked at Islam and the Jinn.
[3:34:20.060 --> 3:34:21.060]  What are the Jinn?
[3:34:21.060 --> 3:34:25.780]  They're entities that operate outside of human sight, manipulating human society.
[3:34:25.780 --> 3:34:32.940]  I looked at the Gnostics, which were a kind of vaguely a form of Christianity in theme,
[3:34:32.940 --> 3:34:35.220]  if not detail.
[3:34:35.220 --> 3:34:41.620]  And they talked about Archons in the writings that they left, there was one amazing group
[3:34:41.620 --> 3:34:47.740]  of writings by Gnostics that were found in an earthen jar in Egypt.
[3:34:47.740 --> 3:34:51.820]  These were mystic Christians that formed the basis of the Renaissance.
[3:34:51.820 --> 3:34:52.820]  Yeah.
[3:34:52.820 --> 3:34:59.940]  And they left these writings, very substantial writings in an earthen jar.
[3:34:59.940 --> 3:35:06.700]  It's estimated that they were hidden away about 75 miles north of Luxor in Egypt, a place
[3:35:06.700 --> 3:35:11.260]  called Nagamadi, about 400 AD.
[3:35:11.260 --> 3:35:16.900]  And about a fifth of these writings, after they were found in 1945, were found to be
[3:35:16.900 --> 3:35:18.980]  about these Archons.
[3:35:18.980 --> 3:35:22.540]  Now, well, hold on a second, what do they say?
[3:35:22.540 --> 3:35:28.260]  They called them Archons because Archon is a Greek word meaning rulers.
[3:35:28.260 --> 3:35:35.740]  They said that these Archons created what we call the physical world.
[3:35:35.740 --> 3:35:43.020]  And that this was a bad copy of prime reality.
[3:35:43.020 --> 3:35:55.020]  They also talked about the fact that the great ability of these Archons was virtual reality.
[3:35:55.020 --> 3:36:01.140]  In the translation, what we would call today virtual reality, the ability to manipulate
[3:36:01.140 --> 3:36:07.180]  and generate illusions that made people believe they were somewhere was not anything like
[3:36:07.180 --> 3:36:11.420]  where they thought they were or what they thought it was.
[3:36:11.420 --> 3:36:19.900]  And then you go to the Zulus in South Africa, and they have the concept of the Chittahuri.
[3:36:19.900 --> 3:36:24.380]  And wherever you go, I've talked to Aboriginals in Australia as I've traveled around the
[3:36:24.380 --> 3:36:25.380]  world.
[3:36:25.380 --> 3:36:32.460]  And you see these common, common themes of entities operating outside of human sight,
[3:36:32.460 --> 3:36:36.340]  which is not saying much, given how narrow human sight is.
[3:36:36.340 --> 3:36:40.100]  And they're always trying to drag us into their dimension.
[3:36:40.100 --> 3:36:41.100]  Yeah.
[3:36:41.100 --> 3:36:48.980]  What they see, if we could think of mind, say fourth dimension is or astral dimension
[3:36:48.980 --> 3:36:51.460]  is the dimension of mind.
[3:36:51.460 --> 3:37:00.860]  Now you can be at the higher levels of it and see things and understand things with
[3:37:00.860 --> 3:37:07.660]  your mind that people in these lower levels of the astral dimension, where these entities
[3:37:07.660 --> 3:37:11.820]  are, cannot see.
[3:37:11.820 --> 3:37:18.620]  You're much more expansive in your understanding, in your ability to see the greater picture.
[3:37:18.620 --> 3:37:24.380]  You go beyond that too, way beyond that, but you're seeing a much bigger picture.
[3:37:24.380 --> 3:37:33.060]  Whereas in the lower levels of this astral dimension, this is where these entities are,
[3:37:33.060 --> 3:37:38.900]  what are called archons and demons and all these different names for the same entities,
[3:37:38.900 --> 3:37:43.380]  the gods as the ancients would perceive them.
[3:37:43.380 --> 3:37:49.620]  And so they are dominating that area of this astral dimension.
[3:37:49.620 --> 3:37:58.820]  So they want your mind, the frequency of your mind thoughts, perceptions to be in that level
[3:37:58.820 --> 3:38:02.060]  of the astral dimension where they dominate.
[3:38:02.060 --> 3:38:08.780]  That's why they're trying to pull us into these low frequency states of mind and of
[3:38:08.780 --> 3:38:09.780]  emotion.
[3:38:09.780 --> 3:38:13.660]  David, I want to get your take on how people can break out of that, but I want to play
[3:38:13.660 --> 3:38:14.660]  this clip.
[3:38:14.660 --> 3:38:18.460]  Can you talk about Stockholm Syndrome in your previous books and how they mind control people?
[3:38:18.460 --> 3:38:23.820]  This is Jennifer Gibson, well-known actress, who took one of the poison shots and now has
[3:38:23.820 --> 3:38:24.820]  Bell's palsies.
[3:38:24.820 --> 3:38:26.700]  He says she'd do it again.
[3:38:26.700 --> 3:38:32.100]  I find one of the prime things that these people that are under this control basically
[3:38:32.100 --> 3:38:35.780]  want to destroy themselves and don't care that they're being hurt by the system.
[3:38:35.780 --> 3:38:40.860]  How would we break somebody or how could she break herself out, Jennifer Gibson, out of
[3:38:40.860 --> 3:38:41.860]  these things grasped?
[3:38:41.860 --> 3:38:42.860]  Here's the clip.
[3:38:42.860 --> 3:38:50.860]  Well, this is not a video I want to make and it's kind of hard to make because as I'm
[3:38:50.860 --> 3:38:59.980]  watching myself, I see what I'm going to say, which is I have been diagnosed with Bell's
[3:38:59.980 --> 3:39:09.660]  palsy, which is paralysis on one side of the face, for me it's this side here, obviously.
[3:39:09.660 --> 3:39:17.820]  So I got it about two weeks after getting my vaccine and I had a rough go with the vaccine
[3:39:17.820 --> 3:39:24.780]  and I guess still am, but I have to say that I would do it again because it's what we have
[3:39:24.780 --> 3:39:27.820]  to do to see people.
[3:39:27.820 --> 3:39:34.460]  So I don't know why I'm making this video, but here's my word smile.
[3:39:34.460 --> 3:39:35.980]  It's what we have to do to save people.
[3:39:35.980 --> 3:39:36.980]  She believes she's a hero.
[3:39:36.980 --> 3:39:39.940]  Can't look at the statistics, can't know the facts for herself.
[3:39:39.940 --> 3:39:41.940]  What is going on with this woman, David?
[3:39:41.940 --> 3:39:47.580]  Well, you see what you've got here and we can talk about the fake vaccine as well and
[3:39:47.580 --> 3:39:50.180]  it's effect on the psyche of people.
[3:39:50.180 --> 3:39:54.140]  I mean the number of people, I mean we all interact with people, we both interact with
[3:39:54.140 --> 3:39:57.220]  people a lot and we both read a lot.
[3:39:57.220 --> 3:40:02.540]  Everyone I know that's taken it has less energy, is sick now and acts more zombie like.
[3:40:02.540 --> 3:40:03.540]  It's very sad.
[3:40:03.540 --> 3:40:10.900]  Well, I'll tell you the word, Alex, that I've heard so many times in relation to people
[3:40:10.900 --> 3:40:16.540]  who've had loved ones or work people who they've worked with who've had the fake vaccine when
[3:40:16.540 --> 3:40:18.540]  they have it.
[3:40:18.540 --> 3:40:20.100]  It's vacant.
[3:40:20.100 --> 3:40:23.380]  These people are vacant.
[3:40:23.380 --> 3:40:32.700]  It's basically, we have what people call a soul, which is experiencing this reality
[3:40:32.700 --> 3:40:37.380]  through the human body and that soul is supposed to connect out into the great beyond and the
[3:40:37.380 --> 3:40:41.100]  great expansion of awareness, insight, knowledge, all that stuff.
[3:40:41.100 --> 3:40:46.140]  The idea of these fake vaccines, one level of them, there are many reasons for them,
[3:40:46.140 --> 3:40:53.740]  is to break that connection so that basically, if I'm sitting here in front of a computer
[3:40:53.740 --> 3:40:58.300]  and I'm the soul, I'm interacting with the computer.
[3:40:58.300 --> 3:41:03.020]  I've got the mouse, I've got the keyboard, I'm interacting with it.
[3:41:03.020 --> 3:41:11.620]  But when you get a computer virus, which is essentially in theme is what these fake vaccines
[3:41:11.620 --> 3:41:14.500]  are doing.
[3:41:14.500 --> 3:41:22.020]  That computer virus takes over the operating system and it disconnects the interaction
[3:41:22.020 --> 3:41:27.660]  between me, symbolic of soul, and the operating system, symbolic of the body.
[3:41:27.660 --> 3:41:36.140]  So now the five sense level of the person is running the show and it's been literally
[3:41:36.140 --> 3:41:46.300]  possessed by another force, by being disconnected from its source, what we call the soul.
[3:41:46.300 --> 3:41:51.500]  So with this lady, something has happened physically.
[3:41:51.500 --> 3:41:56.100]  It's happened in the five sense realm of her life.
[3:41:56.100 --> 3:41:59.980]  Therefore, she cannot ignore it.
[3:41:59.980 --> 3:42:01.300]  She can't ignore it.
[3:42:01.300 --> 3:42:03.820]  Her five senses are seeing it.
[3:42:03.820 --> 3:42:05.500]  They're experiencing it.
[3:42:05.500 --> 3:42:08.460]  So that level can't be hidden from her.
[3:42:08.460 --> 3:42:16.260]  But what can be manipulated is her response to it, which comes from perception.
[3:42:16.260 --> 3:42:22.460]  And her perception is that even though I can't ignore it, look at it, what this fake vaccine
[3:42:22.460 --> 3:42:31.060]  has done to me, my response is still, well, I'd have it again, which is insane.
[3:42:31.060 --> 3:42:34.300]  But that's the way the program works.
[3:42:34.300 --> 3:42:41.420]  Now if you were connected to what people call soul, if your mind was more expansive, as
[3:42:41.420 --> 3:42:47.460]  with all the people who have not had the fake facts, they would say, bloody hell, have you
[3:42:47.460 --> 3:42:49.180]  seen what this thing's done to me?
[3:42:49.180 --> 3:42:56.580]  Of course I'd never have it again.
[3:42:56.580 --> 3:42:58.380]  It's our best seller.
[3:42:58.380 --> 3:43:01.740]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[3:43:01.740 --> 3:43:06.740]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[3:43:06.740 --> 3:43:10.740]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[3:43:10.740 --> 3:43:14.100]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[3:43:14.100 --> 3:43:19.540]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[3:43:19.540 --> 3:43:20.540]  function of the body.
[3:43:20.540 --> 3:43:25.340]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[3:43:25.340 --> 3:43:27.940]  need to live and be healthy.
[3:43:27.940 --> 3:43:30.220]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[3:43:30.220 --> 3:43:34.220]  Because so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is
[3:43:34.220 --> 3:43:38.220]  critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[3:43:38.220 --> 3:43:41.700]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[3:43:41.700 --> 3:43:45.220]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the infill war.

[3:46:57.020 --> 3:47:12.340]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:12.340 --> 3:47:19.460]  That's what you would say if you had any kind of expansive mind, but these people do not
[3:47:19.460 --> 3:47:24.620]  and therefore they cannot, coming back to what I said earlier Alex, they literally cannot
[3:47:24.620 --> 3:47:27.340]  process the information.
[3:47:27.340 --> 3:47:28.340]  Absolutely.
[3:47:28.340 --> 3:47:29.980]  So how do you get her out of the trance?
[3:47:29.980 --> 3:47:35.940]  How do you, I mean, how do we help these people or are they just lost causes?
[3:47:35.940 --> 3:47:46.900]  Well, as I say earlier in our chat, everything is mind, everything is mind.
[3:47:46.900 --> 3:47:58.220]  This force is manipulating mind to perceive and conclude in a way that suits its agenda,
[3:47:58.220 --> 3:48:05.980]  but mind consciousness beyond mind into the great beyond what people call spirit is capable
[3:48:05.980 --> 3:48:09.100]  of overriding that.
[3:48:09.100 --> 3:48:21.460]  You know, I've said in the trap that the mind is not in the body, the body is in the mind.
[3:48:21.460 --> 3:48:28.980]  Mind is generating or decoding the information into what we call the body.
[3:48:28.980 --> 3:48:37.340]  Now once the mind is manipulated to believe it's in the body and the body systems are
[3:48:37.340 --> 3:48:45.660]  the dominant force in the relationship, then when a doctor says to someone you've got five
[3:48:45.660 --> 3:48:53.020]  months to live, if you look at the statistics, you'll see that the doctor's prognosis for
[3:48:53.020 --> 3:49:01.380]  life turns out to be overwhelmingly the period that people live before they die.
[3:49:01.380 --> 3:49:03.820]  Now is that because doctors are so clever?
[3:49:03.820 --> 3:49:04.820]  No, no.
[3:49:04.820 --> 3:49:07.020]  Are you bloody kidding?
[3:49:07.020 --> 3:49:14.500]  It's because the mind takes on the belief that it has five months to live and that's
[3:49:14.500 --> 3:49:15.500]  what it creates.
[3:49:15.500 --> 3:49:20.820]  A reverse placebo, psychosomatic, incredible, and I understand the technical is what you're
[3:49:20.820 --> 3:49:21.820]  saying, you're totally right.
[3:49:21.820 --> 3:49:26.700]  I'm asking, if you had five minutes to talk to this woman on a park bench, what would
[3:49:26.700 --> 3:49:31.980]  David Ike, just not as a philosopher, not as a best-selling author, not as a researcher,
[3:49:31.980 --> 3:49:36.020]  not as a trailblazer, a maverick, but just as a man, if she was saying this to you, how
[3:49:36.020 --> 3:49:40.460]  is there any tricks to get her to realize she can override the control, she can get back
[3:49:40.460 --> 3:49:45.780]  in control, like look at you, what have they done to you, sweetheart, are you giving her
[3:49:45.780 --> 3:49:51.340]  statistics or is there some way to get her out of the Stockholm syndrome?
[3:49:51.340 --> 3:50:00.580]  Well in the end, it's information that creates the program that programs people into that
[3:50:00.580 --> 3:50:05.180]  state of mind and therefore it's information that can deprogram.
[3:50:05.180 --> 3:50:11.380]  So people need to flood her Twitter and Instagram with this interview today and so she needs
[3:50:11.380 --> 3:50:12.380]  outreach.
[3:50:12.380 --> 3:50:20.980]  Yeah, what I would say to her is look at, first of all, look at this level and look
[3:50:20.980 --> 3:50:29.180]  at the fact that you've taken a fake vaccine, which is not a vaccine by any previous criteria,
[3:50:29.180 --> 3:50:31.980]  and you've got into this state.
[3:50:31.980 --> 3:50:39.340]  Now why would you then say you'd have it again given what it's done to you?
[3:50:39.340 --> 3:50:46.420]  I would then show her all the other people across the world just going by the VAERS system
[3:50:46.420 --> 3:50:51.820]  in America and the yellow card system of reporting in Britain, which is only between one and
[3:50:51.820 --> 3:50:57.460]  ten percent maximum of their actual deaths and adverse effects.
[3:50:57.460 --> 3:51:05.100]  And I would point out that the consequences, not just for her, it's not just the one off,
[3:51:05.100 --> 3:51:12.540]  are absolutely massive, both in deaths and in destroyed health long term and reduced
[3:51:12.540 --> 3:51:14.700]  life expectancy.
[3:51:14.700 --> 3:51:20.100]  And then I'd ask them if they asked her if she really believed that someone who would
[3:51:20.100 --> 3:51:23.860]  promote that had the best interests of humanity at heart.
[3:51:23.860 --> 3:51:31.460]  I would show her all the kids' figures who've died about having this fake vaccine, because
[3:51:31.460 --> 3:51:39.340]  the question comes, why do they want to give this fake vaccine and it's the ones that follow
[3:51:39.340 --> 3:51:43.220]  to every man, woman, and child on the planet because they want every man, woman, and child
[3:51:43.220 --> 3:51:48.140]  on the planet connected to the cloud and controlled by AI so they don't even have to manipulate
[3:51:48.140 --> 3:51:53.900]  the perception anymore, it comes direct from AI and that's the whole point.
[3:51:53.900 --> 3:51:58.460]  And then I would start to ask her, who do you think you are?
[3:51:58.460 --> 3:52:04.660]  You think you're just that body and I'd go deeper into the nature of reality.
[3:52:04.660 --> 3:52:14.020]  And the only way you can get people out of the program is for them to expand their minds
[3:52:14.020 --> 3:52:19.020]  into greatest ways of consciousness beyond the program.
[3:52:19.020 --> 3:52:22.740]  And this is what Alex, we call awakening.
[3:52:22.740 --> 3:52:24.060]  What is awakening?
[3:52:24.060 --> 3:52:31.620]  It's awakening from the five sense prison, the five sense focus of attention because
[3:52:31.620 --> 3:52:33.020]  that's what it is.
[3:52:33.020 --> 3:52:41.620]  The whole process of human control is of focusing attention on the smallest myopia of possibility
[3:52:41.620 --> 3:52:45.220]  of self-identity of reality.
[3:52:45.220 --> 3:52:56.420]  And so if people can start to ask questions, that's the process, asking questions of what
[3:52:56.420 --> 3:53:00.740]  they've been told and they'll realize if they do any research at all or read other people's
[3:53:00.740 --> 3:53:04.100]  research, they'll see that what they're told overwhelming, there is no...
[3:53:04.100 --> 3:53:05.100]  Absolutely.
[3:53:05.100 --> 3:53:06.100]  Well, well, David, you have been so...
[3:53:06.100 --> 3:53:07.100]  You've been so...
[3:53:07.100 --> 3:53:08.100]  Go ahead.
[3:53:08.100 --> 3:53:09.100]  Lies.
[3:53:09.100 --> 3:53:13.700]  So if an authority tells you something, whether it's a fake vaccine or the reason for a war,
[3:53:13.700 --> 3:53:21.420]  what you say is okay on the basis of the entirety of human known human history, authority lies.
[3:53:21.420 --> 3:53:27.020]  So I'm going to start on the basis that what you're telling me is a bloody lie, like the
[3:53:27.020 --> 3:53:32.620]  gas pipeline this week, and you've got to convince me with evidence that this time you're
[3:53:32.620 --> 3:53:36.100]  not lying and they never will because they're always bloody lying.
[3:53:36.100 --> 3:53:42.580]  So awakening is... and what you're doing when you're awakening, what's the process?
[3:53:42.580 --> 3:53:48.660]  You're opening your mind to other possibilities.
[3:53:48.660 --> 3:53:56.380]  Once you start that process, what are the other possibilities of what is happening or
[3:53:56.380 --> 3:53:59.780]  other possibilities of the reality I'm experiencing?
[3:53:59.780 --> 3:54:05.620]  That questioning starts to open your mind and you start to see things you couldn't see
[3:54:05.620 --> 3:54:06.620]  before.
[3:54:06.620 --> 3:54:12.940]  And there's a real process, and so many people watching this program, this chat, will have
[3:54:12.940 --> 3:54:16.700]  gone through this, otherwise they wouldn't be watching this.
[3:54:16.700 --> 3:54:26.460]  There's this process known as synchronicity, which Jung talked about, the Swiss psychiatrist
[3:54:26.460 --> 3:54:33.660]  called Jung, synchronicity, where things just happen and you think, what's the chances
[3:54:33.660 --> 3:54:34.660]  of that?
[3:54:34.660 --> 3:54:37.900]  There's another coincidence, lie me, how did that happen?
[3:54:37.900 --> 3:54:47.060]  And what it is, is this, when you are operating on a certain perceptual state, that frequency
[3:54:47.060 --> 3:54:53.140]  that's going out, that is a frequency reflection of the perceptual state, is pulling towards
[3:54:53.140 --> 3:54:59.420]  you other frequencies, other magnetic fields called people, places, ways of life, experiences
[3:54:59.420 --> 3:55:04.420]  that relate to that original perception.
[3:55:04.420 --> 3:55:12.860]  So if your perceptions are only coming from mainstream media, the mainstream everything,
[3:55:12.860 --> 3:55:19.660]  then what you will do will experience things that seem to confirm that what you're told
[3:55:19.660 --> 3:55:24.060]  by the mainstream everything is true, because that's all you're experiencing.
[3:55:24.060 --> 3:55:29.140]  But when you start to open your mind and say, well, hold on, what's some other explanations
[3:55:29.140 --> 3:55:30.140]  for this?
[3:55:30.140 --> 3:55:32.580]  What's the other possible explanation for this?
[3:55:32.580 --> 3:55:36.780]  That changes the frequency you're putting out because you're expanding, opening your
[3:55:36.780 --> 3:55:39.060]  mind to ask those questions.
[3:55:39.060 --> 3:55:44.940]  And what then happens is you start attracting to you, and it's a frequency attraction of
[3:55:44.940 --> 3:55:51.660]  electromagnetic fields on this level, people, places, ways of life, experiences, coincidences,
[3:55:51.660 --> 3:55:52.660]  that.
[3:55:52.660 --> 3:56:00.860]  And it's the end of this special Friday broadcast.
[3:56:00.860 --> 3:56:04.620]  If you missed any of the Adam Curry interview or the incredible David Eich interview as
[3:56:04.620 --> 3:56:06.340]  well, both are amazing.
[3:56:06.340 --> 3:56:12.020]  We're posting them all commercial free up on band.video.
[3:56:12.020 --> 3:56:15.460]  As we speak, I'm told to be up in an hour or so at band.video.
[3:56:15.460 --> 3:56:16.780]  But let me tell you, it's coming up right now.
[3:56:16.780 --> 3:56:23.340]  The great, the intrepid, a guy that I just admire so much, so wise, so strong for his
[3:56:23.340 --> 3:56:24.340]  age.
[3:56:24.340 --> 3:56:27.420]  I mean, I can't imagine what I was to be like when he's 48, because I just got better and
[3:56:27.420 --> 3:56:30.460]  better over the years and I was about as good as I am already.
[3:56:30.460 --> 3:56:36.100]  So Owen Schreuer is about to take over, 3 to 6 p.m. today at infowars.com, forward slash
[3:56:36.100 --> 3:56:40.580]  show, or on local stations in your area, whatever you do, please send out the link and promote
[3:56:40.580 --> 3:56:41.580]  what we're doing here.
[3:56:41.580 --> 3:56:46.860]  Also, Harris Smith, weekday mornings, 8 a.m., Knox Valley Park as well, infowars.com, forward
[3:56:46.860 --> 3:56:47.860]  slash show.
[3:56:47.860 --> 3:56:49.740]  Thank you all for your support.
[3:56:49.740 --> 3:56:50.740]  It's been humbling.
[3:56:50.740 --> 3:56:55.060]  And as I said, tomorrow, I'm coming up here at 10, we'll probably start taping about 10.30.
[3:56:55.060 --> 3:56:58.500]  You know, the weekday shows are live, Sunday shows are live too, but we do these Saturday
[3:56:58.500 --> 3:57:03.060]  shows, tapes usually, sometimes are live, and we're going to do nuclear war analysis
[3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:09.220]  in detail and how they set up under the UN, these COVID camps that are still being expanded
[3:57:09.220 --> 3:57:11.580]  worldwide for political dissidents.
[3:57:11.580 --> 3:57:16.020]  This is going to be as important information tomorrow's news today, so critical to all our
[3:57:16.020 --> 3:57:17.140]  freedom and future.
[3:57:17.140 --> 3:57:20.620]  We expose this program, we can stop it now, but they keep building it in secret, they're
[3:57:20.620 --> 3:57:25.340]  going to use it on us with worldwide martial law, probably during World War III.
[3:57:25.340 --> 3:57:27.940]  So that's tomorrow.
[3:57:27.940 --> 3:57:28.940]  I'll put a deadline on it.
[3:57:28.940 --> 3:57:35.340]  We'll start streaming it and post it at 1 p.m. tomorrow, 1 p.m. tomorrow, special report
[3:57:35.340 --> 3:57:41.460]  goes live, man.video, special report goes live in the streams at infowars.com, forward
[3:57:41.460 --> 3:57:42.660]  slash show.
[3:57:42.660 --> 3:57:43.660]  Thank you so much.
[3:57:43.660 --> 3:57:46.380]  God bless and good luck.
[3:57:46.380 --> 3:57:48.260]  Look around you.
[3:57:48.260 --> 3:57:51.620]  Everything I predicted from the globalist own documents, from their own admissions is
[3:57:51.620 --> 3:57:53.120]  now happening.
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:54.620]  Infowars credibility.
[3:57:54.620 --> 3:57:56.820]  My credibility has never been higher.
[3:57:56.820 --> 3:58:01.060]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite
[3:58:01.060 --> 3:58:06.180]  the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[3:58:06.180 --> 3:58:10.980]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[3:58:10.980 --> 3:58:16.220]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[3:58:16.220 --> 3:58:20.140]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[3:58:20.140 --> 3:58:25.660]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[3:58:25.660 --> 3:58:26.940]  It's unsustainable.
[3:58:26.940 --> 3:58:34.820]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, $5,
[3:58:34.820 --> 3:58:39.220]  $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[3:58:39.220 --> 3:58:40.220]  I'll never give up.
[3:58:40.220 --> 3:58:42.420]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[3:58:42.420 --> 3:58:43.700]  Thank you for your support.
[3:58:43.700 --> 3:58:44.700]  Wouldn't be without you.
[3:58:44.700 --> 3:58:45.700]  Saveinfowars.com.
[3:58:45.700 --> 3:58:52.300]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[3:58:52.300 --> 3:58:58.820]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America but the world.
[3:58:58.820 --> 3:59:04.340]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[3:59:04.340 --> 3:59:05.340]  deserve the credit.
[3:59:05.340 --> 3:59:10.300]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support in info wars are the real
[3:59:10.300 --> 3:59:12.860]  reason you've had the success.
[3:59:12.860 --> 3:59:18.260]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever had.
[3:59:18.260 --> 3:59:24.980]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important
[3:59:24.980 --> 3:59:28.940]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[3:59:28.940 --> 3:59:31.780]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify it.
[3:59:31.780 --> 3:59:32.780]  God bless you all.
[3:59:32.780 --> 3:59:33.780]  I salute you.
[3:59:33.780 --> 3:59:34.780]  I thank you.
[3:59:34.780 --> 3:59:39.780]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[3:59:39.780 --> 3:59:40.780]  streak is happening.
[3:59:40.780 --> 3:59:41.780]  The fight is my fight.
[3:59:41.780 --> 3:59:42.780]  It's your fight.
[3:59:42.780 --> 3:59:43.780]  It's our fight.
[3:59:43.780 --> 3:59:53.100]  God bless you all.
