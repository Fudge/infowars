[00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:12.199]  It's a frontline report.
[00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.640]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.180]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:28.844]  All right, we are live on this October 14th Friday broadcast and we have got an incredible broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:33.705]  The inventor of podcasting, one of the smartest people out there, about the whole New World Order, Adam Curry,
[00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:39.079]  We'll be joining us, David Icke's joining us, and so much more.
[00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.920]  But wow!
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.323]  Man, the nuclear war clock just went seconds closer to midnight.
[00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:53.167]  You've got leftist eco-terrorists attacking one of the most famous paintings in the world, sunflowers.
[00:00:53.167 --> 00:01:00.271]  We've got that insanity just showing how they're totally trying to pull down civilization and society like demonic zombies.
[00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:10.433]  We have got massive news dealing with it coming out that Pfizer didn't just know the shot didn't work, but they knew it hurt people.
[00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:13.454]  That's coming out.
[00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:15.975]  It's insane.
[00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:20.336]  Absolutely insane what is going on.
[00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:23.957]  And then, yeah, January 6, we know, was a provocateur operation.
[00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:28.558]  We all know Roger Stone and Steve Bannon and everybody are innocent of trying to have an overthrow.
[00:01:28.558 --> 00:01:29.819]  You don't attack the Capitol to do that.
[00:01:30.987 --> 00:01:35.988]  But they're now going into overdrive, literally trying to outlaw their political opposition.
[00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:37.269]  25 days out for the midterms.
[00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:41.070]  Roger pops in at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.651]  All the broadcasts were important, but this one I'm particularly proud of that we have got lined up for you today.
[00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:55.673]  And then separately, I can't announce it yet, but man, behind the scenes, what they're doing to me, what they're trying to do to you, it's next level because they're desperate.
[00:01:55.673 --> 00:01:57.574]  They know the world's turning against them.
[00:01:57.574 --> 00:01:58.574]  The world's waking up.
[00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:01.521]  It is just insane what's going down.
[00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:05.762]  It is totally insane what is unfolding.
[00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:10.863]  And the good news is we have God on our side and we're going to make it through this together.
[00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:15.064]  But I just cannot, I cannot thank you as the viewers and listeners enough.
[00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:21.405]  I mean, there's nothing I want more in the world than to defeat tyranny.
[00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:24.045]  It's like a sheepdog wants to attack wolves.
[00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:25.866]  It's not like even a desire.
[00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.446]  It's not even a drive.
[00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.206]  It is an order.
[00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:32.179]  And it's only you that keeps me in the fight.
[00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.523]  So I don't worship you, but almost do.
[00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:37.726]  I worship God.
[00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:41.411]  But that's why when you call in praising me, I'm just like, stop.
[00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.813]  Do you understand we're in this together?
[00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:44.696]  I love you.
[00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:45.196]  Thank you.
[00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:46.258]  Just help me fight, please.
[00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.950]  This
[00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:08.264]  I have no more fear.
[00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:20.570]  I never had a lot of fear but I would get trepidation and get upset and be frustrated and be angry and now I just have peace because I know there's a real God that made us and I know there's a real devil who will be defeated and I know we're gonna make it through this.
[00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.202]  Together.
[00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:28.847]  And for every person they censor and shut down, so many other beautiful people pop up.
[00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:31.749]  And I'm just seeing all these new folks.
[00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:36.534]  Brown, yellow, red, black, pink.
[00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:38.095]  Some folks have beautiful porcelain skin.
[00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:38.415]  It's true.
[00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:39.957]  Some are like what you'd call white.
[00:03:39.957 --> 00:03:46.983]  But beautiful ebony skin and beautiful, just beautiful humans with beautiful eyes and beautiful souls.
[00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:47.684]  And so beautiful.
[00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:49.716]  And so good.
[00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:51.318]  The soul is what's so beautiful.
[00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:53.119]  It shines through those eyes.
[00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:58.545]  And to see this test and what it's really all about to show who's who is incredible.
[00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:00.026]  A lot of people are going to tap out.
[00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:01.728]  A lot of people are going to back down.
[00:04:01.728 --> 00:04:03.830]  A lot of people are going to roll over and try to hide.
[00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.653]  But this broadcast is not about hiding.
[00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:09.856]  This broadcast is about victory and overcoming.
[00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:13.059]  And when the enemy comes in like a flood,
[00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:18.250]  The Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:34.266]  And I'm not that standard, but we together, collectively, our guests, our callers, the crew, our reporters, everything that's InfoWars is, is the standard that when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord
[00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:45.387]  Lifts up a standard against it, and I can feel my spirit in the wind as that standard, as that flag going forward.
[00:04:45.387 --> 00:04:50.471]  I can feel the energy and the resistance and the power of the people.
[00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:53.214]  And I am just so honored to be here with you.
[00:04:53.214 --> 00:04:54.755]  God bless you all.
[00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:55.896]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:57.838]  The transmission kicks off in 60 seconds.
[00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:02.935]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.820]  You'll just take them and you'll just try them.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.962]  I know you'll be our big customers.
[00:05:18.962 --> 00:05:22.184]  And finally, one of our best-selling products, sold out for months, it's back in stock.
[00:05:22.184 --> 00:05:23.165]  It's X3.
[00:05:23.165 --> 00:05:33.832]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:38.435]  So X3, despite the fact it was run on iodine, is still on sale.

[00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.373]  X3 50% off, InfoWarStore.com.
[00:06:11.218 --> 00:06:12.339]  Big Brother.
[00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.141]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:16.022]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.022 --> 00:06:17.743]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:19.405]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.405 --> 00:06:25.270]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:35.198]  So, if you want to know the enemy main battle plan, it's the destabilization of civilization, the destruction of the family, the annihilation of small businesses and farms, to make us dependent on them.
[00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:48.712]  Then they'll have this digital overlay, digital currency, where they can program the digital tokens, where you can only spend them the ways they want you to, and they can track and trace you, and basically take money out of your account anytime they want.
[00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:50.413]  That's the golden goose.
[00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:52.074]  That's the brass ring.
[00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:54.916]  That's what the New World Order wants.
[00:06:54.916 --> 00:07:00.380]  And PayPal, a totally New World Order company, Peter Thiel hasn't owned it in over a decade.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.542]  When I got banned on PayPal like four years ago, they go, Peter Thiel's a conservative.
[00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:04.182]  He wouldn't ban you.
[00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:05.423]  He didn't own it.
[00:07:05.423 --> 00:07:06.424]  Didn't have any interest in it anymore.
[00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.470]  I don't
[00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:26.128]  This J.P.
[00:07:26.128 --> 00:07:34.194]  Sears great little piece that the news host and comedian just released dealing with this because it's all completely accurate.
[00:07:34.194 --> 00:07:35.275]  It's all real.
[00:07:35.275 --> 00:07:40.219]  He just puts it in a comical fashion except he says the power is the people rallying and saying no.
[00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:41.600]  That's what's defeating PayPal.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.162]  And that's true.
[00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:45.603]  But PayPal didn't do this on its own.
[00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:47.184]  This is the admitted agenda.
[00:07:47.184 --> 00:07:50.607]  This is already in place in China, going in in India and many other places.
[00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:57.401]  So the secret to this is, yes, we can do it until all the platforms do it.
[00:07:57.401 --> 00:07:59.322]  And that's what they're putting in place.
[00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:02.223]  And then you must follow every directive they give you.
[00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:04.464]  And it won't just be the latest leftist directive.
[00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:07.205]  Once the chains are on, it will be depopulation.
[00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:08.566]  It will be sterilization.
[00:08:08.566 --> 00:08:10.306]  It will be death.
[00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:13.768]  Total surveillance, total control.
[00:08:13.768 --> 00:08:14.308]  So J.P.
[00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:17.489]  Sears, I give him an A+, a 95.
[00:08:17.489 --> 00:08:18.130]  But you can get a 100.
[00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.891]  Because he didn't explain
[00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.950]  The Achilles heel.
[00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:38.573]  Once they get this in system-wide, once they make college students or federal workers or certain groups accept a social credit score, then it's for everybody else later, the military, then it's for everybody.
[00:08:38.573 --> 00:08:39.913]  So that's when they get us.
[00:08:39.913 --> 00:08:43.554]  But they are trying it and now's the key time to beat it and say no.
[00:08:43.554 --> 00:08:45.775]  And humanity is waking up and is saying no.
[00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.595]  So the front and center is this.
[00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:54.158]  They may be able to freeze your bank account, control your digital currency, force you onto this, get rid of cash.
[00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:55.178]  That's the holy grail.
[00:08:55.178 --> 00:08:56.619]  That's the mark of the beast.
[00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.741]  And so here's the piece where J.P.
[00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:01.162]  Sears really knocks it all apart.
[00:09:05.576 --> 00:09:11.400]  Alright, we're making billions of dollars and that's still not enough.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.922]  We need to figure out how we can make even more money from our users.
[00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:19.785]  You mean even more money than we already charge for transactions?
[00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:20.585]  Yes!
[00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:22.687]  We're just making peanuts!
[00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:31.252]  We need to find a way to massively spike our profits by asserting more control over our users as people.
[00:09:31.252 --> 00:09:34.414]  Well that'll be tough to think of in a way that's ethical.
[00:09:35.134 --> 00:09:36.334]  I've got an idea.
[00:09:36.334 --> 00:09:37.895]  Yes, Cletus?
[00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:38.835]  What is it?
[00:09:38.835 --> 00:09:42.915]  Well, what if we treat our users like they're criminals?
[00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.696]  I like where you're going with this.
[00:09:44.696 --> 00:09:45.996]  Say more.
[00:09:45.996 --> 00:09:49.157]  Yeah, like, what if we fine our users $2,500?
[00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:51.937]  Fine them for what?
[00:09:51.937 --> 00:09:58.698]  We fine them $2,500 any time they speak misinformation.
[00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:02.119]  And who determines what this misinformation is?
[00:10:03.246 --> 00:10:04.067]  We do.
[00:10:04.067 --> 00:10:05.129]  I like it.
[00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:10.657]  Well, even if we fine them, sir, no one's gonna just willingly pay us for a fine like that.
[00:10:10.657 --> 00:10:11.959]  They won't have to.
[00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:16.886]  We take it from them by directly debiting their accounts because we hold all their money.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.681]  What do the numbers on this look like?
[00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:22.501]  I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:23.622]  Silence!
[00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:24.642]  Cletus!
[00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:26.903]  What do our projections on this look like?
[00:10:26.903 --> 00:10:37.666]  Well, we have 429 million users and we determine what misinformation is based on the working definition of misinformation is anything we disagree with.
[00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:45.369]  Then we correlate that with a statistical analysis we ran of how many people will eventually say something that we disagree with and we find
[00:10:47.253 --> 00:10:48.515]  That's all of them.
[00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:57.087]  Then we take all of them, our 429 million users, and multiply that by the misinformation find slash take of $2,500, and that equals...
[00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.733]  $1,072,500,000 in new revenue.
[00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:09.717]  That is amazing.
[00:11:09.717 --> 00:11:11.979]  Are there any downsides to this policy?
[00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:14.501]  None that I've been able to think of.
[00:11:14.501 --> 00:11:15.722]  Exactly.
[00:11:15.722 --> 00:11:17.563]  No downsides at all.
[00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:19.085]  I think this is a bad idea.
[00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:23.028]  Put this out of the new terms of service immediately.
[00:11:23.028 --> 00:11:23.869]  Sure thing, boss.
[00:11:27.483 --> 00:11:32.268]  Okay, so it turns out there was a downside we didn't think of.
[00:11:32.268 --> 00:11:33.229]  Really?
[00:11:33.229 --> 00:11:33.910]  What's that?
[00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.752]  We're getting major backlash.
[00:11:35.752 --> 00:11:37.614]  People don't like the policy.
[00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:38.795]  Who cares what people like?
[00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:40.637]  This is amazing for us.
[00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:41.938]  We ran the numbers.
[00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:43.700]  Excellent point, sir.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.462]  But we're hemorrhaging users.
[00:11:45.462 --> 00:11:47.524]  People are closing their accounts left and right.
[00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:50.787]  No longer using PayPal.
[00:11:50.787 --> 00:11:53.771]  Who told these people they could just stop using PayPal?
[00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:55.473]  They can't just do that.
[00:11:55.473 --> 00:11:57.396]  They actually can.
[00:11:57.396 --> 00:11:59.759]  I didn't know they could just do that.
[00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:03.944]  Well, they need to stop it, because I don't like that they're doing that.
[00:12:03.944 --> 00:12:04.485]  But they are.
[00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:17.572]  It looks like this new scheme to make us a lot more money by serving our users much better with this new policy could end up costing us a lot if we don't act fast.
[00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:21.194]  Alright, we need to backtrack fast.
[00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:26.137]  We need a statement that's going to win back the trust of our users and keep them on the platform.
[00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:29.075]  Cletus, any ideas?
[00:12:29.075 --> 00:12:32.818]  Yeah, we could just tell people we did it by accident.
[00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:34.619]  That's brilliant!
[00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:36.520]  They'll definitely go for that.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.941]  I don't think they will.
[00:12:37.941 --> 00:12:39.562]  How would that sound?
[00:12:39.562 --> 00:12:42.404]  I've already written up our statement, sir.
[00:12:42.404 --> 00:12:50.029]  PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy.
[00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:52.771]  We're sorry for the confusion this has caused.
[00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.292]  That's perfect!
[00:12:54.292 --> 00:12:56.093]  Did you write that in crayon?
[00:12:56.093 --> 00:12:56.694]  Publish it!
[00:13:00.216 --> 00:13:03.237]  Well, have we fully recovered yet?
[00:13:03.237 --> 00:13:06.218]  It looks like our statement didn't exactly work, sir.
[00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:06.859]  What do you mean?
[00:13:06.859 --> 00:13:09.180]  Well, things have gotten even worse.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.061]  We've lost six billion dollars in market cap.
[00:13:12.061 --> 00:13:13.482]  How could that be?
[00:13:13.482 --> 00:13:18.544]  We told these morons we didn't mean to do the thing that we deliberately did!
[00:13:18.544 --> 00:13:21.186]  Yeah, but it's almost like they somehow just...
[00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:23.127]  No.
[00:13:23.127 --> 00:13:28.312]  They're still leaving the platform in droves because they know what we're about.
[00:13:28.312 --> 00:13:30.554]  I can't believe our statement didn't work!
[00:13:30.554 --> 00:13:35.059]  We're powerful big tech, and our users are just moronic people!
[00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:36.780]  Another great point, sir.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.885]  But it looks like when people unite, they're seemingly more powerful than we are.
[00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:48.989]  Enough of your kumbaya hippie bulls**t. Losing $6 billion in market cap almost overnight?
[00:13:48.989 --> 00:13:53.812]  We need a new strategy to boost our revenue and fast.
[00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:58.694]  We could fine people for trying to leave the platform.
[00:13:58.694 --> 00:14:00.715]  Say more about that.
[00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:05.077]  Alright, great job.
[00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:05.797]  JP Sears.
[00:14:05.797 --> 00:14:08.559]  You can see the full video on his YouTube site and his website.
[00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:09.819]  There it is on screen.
[00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:11.100]  But here's the problem.
[00:14:12.842 --> 00:14:17.204]  Since he cut that video, they came out and said, you know what, we are going to go ahead and fine you.
[00:14:17.204 --> 00:14:20.766]  But only if you're a racist, but they can fine us anything they want.
[00:14:20.766 --> 00:14:27.410]  But understand, what PayPal's doing is the whole model of the whole thing we've been harping on for decades, it's here.
[00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:38.156]  So once they get it in place everywhere, and Visa, and MasterCard, and JP Morgan, Chase just took Kanye off of his bank account, it's here.
[00:14:39.338 --> 00:14:42.699]  We've got to find the companies and the banks that'll work with us.
[00:14:42.699 --> 00:14:44.779]  And that's what I'm doing behind the scenes.
[00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:46.420]  Got some big stuff ready to launch.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.841]  Not BS where, oh, we got a place for you to bank that's actually for you.
[00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:50.901]  And then it really isn't.
[00:14:50.901 --> 00:14:52.982]  But the real deal with some big players.
[00:14:52.982 --> 00:14:55.542]  There's a lot of folks that want to go along with this that are very successful.
[00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:59.023]  So we've been the main target of this.
[00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:03.084]  And as Nietzsche said, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger, only makes you stronger.
[00:15:03.084 --> 00:15:04.164]  Because we didn't give up.
[00:15:04.164 --> 00:15:06.165]  We've learned a lot of this and we're ready for it.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:13.467]  But that's currently going on against Infowars, so that's why your prayer, that's why your support, that's why you're worried about this so critical.
[00:15:13.467 --> 00:15:17.491]  We're in the endgame now.
[00:15:17.491 --> 00:15:18.252]  That's where we are.
[00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:21.516]  Alright, I want to talk about solutions when we come back.
[00:15:21.516 --> 00:15:27.963]  Amazing footage of leftists finally waking up and confronting their globalist controllers.
[00:15:29.025 --> 00:15:35.570]  Not just AOC getting confronted about nuclear war, but Rashid Tlaib being confronted about pedophilia and the Democratic Party.
[00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.630]  That's coming up.
[00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:41.594]  But please remember, InfoWarStore.com has products ready to ship to you.
[00:15:41.594 --> 00:15:44.036]  The globalists can't take it down because it's in bankruptcy.
[00:15:44.036 --> 00:15:45.236]  Chapter 5.
[00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.998]  We're going to continue on as long as you support.
[00:15:46.998 --> 00:15:48.419]  Ready to ship products to you right now.
[00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:52.502]  Promo code 1776 gets you an additional 10% off at checkout.
[00:15:52.502 --> 00:15:58.126]  That means on a product 50% off, like X3, or DNA Force Plus, you get 60.
[00:16:00.134 --> 00:16:01.975]  It's our bestseller.
[00:16:01.975 --> 00:16:05.738]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[00:16:05.738 --> 00:16:14.825]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[00:16:14.825 --> 00:16:17.427]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[00:16:17.427 --> 00:16:24.072]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[00:16:24.072 --> 00:16:25.093]  It has all the minerals.
[00:16:25.613 --> 00:16:27.035]  All the key amino acids.
[00:16:27.035 --> 00:16:31.199]  All of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.802]  Essential means without these things you die.
[00:16:33.802 --> 00:16:35.865]  And so much of the food is debased.
[00:16:35.865 --> 00:16:37.767]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:41.911]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[00:16:41.911 --> 00:16:44.134]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[00:16:44.594 --> 00:16:48.798]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.

[00:17:20.982 --> 00:17:25.425]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[00:17:25.425 --> 00:17:26.686]  And I need your support.
[00:17:26.686 --> 00:17:34.311]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com

[00:17:47.696 --> 00:17:51.918]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:01.902]  Look, it's not hype that InfoWars has changed the world.
[00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:07.383]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars is the reason we were able to do this.
[00:18:07.383 --> 00:18:09.064]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:12.985]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[00:18:12.985 --> 00:18:16.866]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[00:18:16.866 --> 00:18:19.427]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells.
[00:18:19.427 --> 00:18:20.568]  It does just give you more energy.
[00:18:20.568 --> 00:18:21.728]  It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:28.429]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[00:18:28.429 --> 00:18:32.810]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.
[00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.871]  Take a few drops every day and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:38.351]  Plus it funds the InfoWar.
[00:18:38.351 --> 00:18:42.151]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[00:19:57.689 --> 00:20:00.450]  Visit InfoWareStore.com right now.
[00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:06.352]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:14.224 --> 00:20:20.049]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:21.771]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:30.218]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.218 --> 00:20:33.381]  So, there's a lot of Achilles heels that globalists have.
[00:20:33.381 --> 00:20:38.406]  People waking up, people saying no, people being independent, people supporting local business, people getting back to God's number one.
[00:20:40.367 --> 00:20:47.371]  And it's also their own constituents waking up to the fact that you're in a cult and you're being run into the ground.
[00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:53.754]  So all over the country, I've got dozens of clips here of this, but I'm going to just play two because of time constraints.
[00:20:53.754 --> 00:21:06.361]  Dozens of clips of AOC getting confronted, we talked about it yesterday, of Rashid Tlaib being confronted by their constituents who were angry en masse over the pedophilia support, over the nuclear war support, over all of it.
[00:21:07.765 --> 00:21:17.896]  And as soon as these people finally wake up that the average Christian or conservative or white person or gun owner or Republican is not their enemy, it's game over for the globalists.
[00:21:17.896 --> 00:21:22.862]  Because our enemy is the Democratic Party and the CCP and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[00:21:22.862 --> 00:21:27.928]  So here it is in New York, again AOC being confronted about nuclear war.
[00:21:29.403 --> 00:21:37.507]  Congresswoman, none of this matters unless there's a nuclear war, which you voted to send arms and weapons to Ukraine.
[00:21:37.507 --> 00:21:43.191]  Kelsey Gathers, she's left the Democratic Party, because there are so many war hunts, okay?
[00:21:43.191 --> 00:21:48.734]  You originally voted, you ran as an outsider, yet you've been voting to start this war in Ukraine.
[00:21:48.734 --> 00:21:52.876]  You're voting to start a further nuclear war with Russia and China.
[00:21:52.876 --> 00:21:56.738]  Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens?
[00:21:56.738 --> 00:21:58.239]  You're playing with our lives.
[00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:02.821]  There will be no neighbors if there's a nuclear bomb!
[00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:07.182]  You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis!
[00:22:07.182 --> 00:22:08.583]  You're a coward!
[00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:10.543]  You're a progressive socialist!
[00:22:10.543 --> 00:22:13.384]  Where are you against the war mobilization?
[00:22:13.384 --> 00:22:15.545]  He's telling the right truth!
[00:22:15.545 --> 00:22:17.426]  You have done nothing!
[00:22:17.426 --> 00:22:22.207]  Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts where you've shown cowardice!
[00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:26.629]  I believed in you and you became the very thing you sought to fight against!
[00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:29.554]  That's what you've become.
[00:22:29.554 --> 00:22:40.584]  You are the establishment and you are the reason why everybody will end up in a nuclear war unless you choose to stand up right now and denounce the Democratic Party.
[00:22:40.584 --> 00:22:42.586]  Will you do that?
[00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:45.649]  Choose always the establishment.
[00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:47.190]  Okay, simple.
[00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.133]  Are you going to stop nuclear war?
[00:22:50.133 --> 00:22:50.914]  Yes or no?
[00:22:52.179 --> 00:22:53.140]  There is no lie.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.821]  Little tip to the left.
[00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:58.483]  When Vogue Magazine and CNN's promoting you, you're for the establishment.
[00:22:58.483 --> 00:23:00.084]  You know that!
[00:23:00.084 --> 00:23:06.128]  Then let's take it up right now because this is the only thing that matters.
[00:23:06.128 --> 00:23:06.889]  Alright, that's good.
[00:23:06.889 --> 00:23:09.110]  He goes on the full videos on Infowars.com.
[00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:12.115]  And obviously they think socialism is going to save them.
[00:23:12.115 --> 00:23:14.636]  They don't know the big banks are funding that to make them dependent.
[00:23:14.636 --> 00:23:16.877]  But they're at least getting that she doesn't represent them.
[00:23:16.877 --> 00:23:19.438]  And there she is in a college with like 50 people.
[00:23:19.438 --> 00:23:20.498]  No one wants to see her.
[00:23:20.498 --> 00:23:21.718]  Nobody cares.
[00:23:21.718 --> 00:23:23.219]  I said I was going to college not bragging.
[00:23:23.219 --> 00:23:25.679]  10,000 show up in one day.
[00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:27.120]  No announcement.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.340]  People hear one day I'm coming.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.201]  No big push.
[00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:30.701]  10,000.
[00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:31.821]  Trump shows up.
[00:23:31.821 --> 00:23:32.481]  100,000.
[00:23:32.481 --> 00:23:33.622]  These people are a joke.
[00:23:33.622 --> 00:23:35.242]  They're a straw dog.
[00:23:35.242 --> 00:23:36.122]  They're a paper tiger.
[00:23:36.122 --> 00:23:37.863]  But people don't call them on that.
[00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:41.422]  So here is Rashid Tlaib.
[00:23:41.422 --> 00:23:43.723]  This is happening in Michigan.
[00:23:43.723 --> 00:23:46.064]  This is happening in Minnesota.
[00:23:46.064 --> 00:23:48.425]  Good job with the Muslims!
[00:23:48.425 --> 00:23:52.727]  They're like, you're going to literally have pornographic stuff for middle schoolers?
[00:23:52.727 --> 00:23:53.467]  I've seen these books.
[00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:54.667]  I can't show them all here.
[00:23:54.667 --> 00:24:03.071]  They are children having sex with their teachers, men giving children blowjobs, sexually assaulting them.
[00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:03.991]  That's shown in Austin.
[00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:05.592]  That's in all the middle schools in Austin.
[00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:08.297]  6th, 7th graders.
[00:24:08.297 --> 00:24:10.759]  8th, yeah, 8th graders.
[00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:13.602]  Literal cartoon porn.
[00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:19.815]  I mean, I've never looked at child porn in my life, thank God, never seen it, until I looked at the book when we covered it last year.
[00:24:19.815 --> 00:24:26.899]  And I looked at the book that was at the Austin Library, School Library, Austin AISD Library, and I was like, okay, I hear this.
[00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:28.720]  I'm like, what the hell?
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.501]  It's literally children being raped by adults.
[00:24:31.501 --> 00:24:35.263]  And I'm like, oh my God, I have been assaulted.
[00:24:35.263 --> 00:24:36.824]  I have never seen something like this.
[00:24:36.824 --> 00:24:38.385]  I would never want to see this.
[00:24:38.385 --> 00:24:40.986]  And now I'm looking at children being raped.
[00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:47.678]  It's who these people are.
[00:24:47.678 --> 00:24:49.319]  They claim they have the moral high ground.
[00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:50.939]  So here's Tlaib being confronted about it.
[00:24:50.939 --> 00:24:53.220]  I'm not against the gay people.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.581]  I'm not against anything.
[00:24:54.581 --> 00:24:56.021]  I'm against the books.
[00:24:56.021 --> 00:24:56.462]  Okay?
[00:24:56.462 --> 00:25:03.964]  Don't sit here and say that people are sitting here coming to you guys and just telling you, oh, we want these books out.
[00:25:03.964 --> 00:25:05.425]  You're worried about the gay people?
[00:25:05.425 --> 00:25:05.965]  No problem.
[00:25:05.965 --> 00:25:07.026]  We're not worried about the gay people.
[00:25:07.026 --> 00:25:08.006]  We're worried about our children.
[00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:09.699]  Okay?
[00:25:09.699 --> 00:25:17.361]  And second of all, I don't want to hear anybody, okay, saying they're saying, oh, you guys are offending the gay.
[00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:18.561]  These are kids!
[00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:19.002]  They can be 18.
[00:25:19.002 --> 00:25:22.142]  If they want to become gay, let them become gay.
[00:25:22.142 --> 00:25:23.843]  Who cares?
[00:25:23.843 --> 00:25:25.703]  It's not a problem.
[00:25:25.703 --> 00:25:29.404]  We don't want kids to have access to these books.
[00:25:29.404 --> 00:25:30.484]  It's nice and simple.
[00:25:30.484 --> 00:25:32.365]  I'm not going to address the situation no more.
[00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.290]  It is.
[00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.251]  It is what it is.
[00:25:35.251 --> 00:25:39.453]  And the only person that's behind this is Rashida Tlaib.
[00:25:39.453 --> 00:25:41.855]  Cool.
[00:25:41.855 --> 00:25:42.795]  Oh, there it is!
[00:25:42.795 --> 00:25:44.896]  Holy shit!
[00:25:44.896 --> 00:25:47.598]  Holy shit!
[00:25:47.598 --> 00:25:48.519]  Too much cussing on this.
[00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:50.480]  I guess we didn't bleep it, so we got to turn it off.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.522]  It was Christy Lee, reporter for InfoWars.
[00:25:54.522 --> 00:25:58.984]  She moved here two years ago with her family and her four children with her husband.
[00:25:58.984 --> 00:26:01.286]  And she put her child in the AISD.
[00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:05.031]  She comes to me and says, I'm going to cover this book, will you look at it?
[00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:06.913]  And I'd heard about the book, I'd never looked.
[00:26:06.913 --> 00:26:07.814]  I went, sure.
[00:26:07.814 --> 00:26:08.955]  She goes, you know, there's pedophilia.
[00:26:08.955 --> 00:26:10.777]  And I'm like, really?
[00:26:10.777 --> 00:26:11.598]  She goes, just look at it.
[00:26:11.598 --> 00:26:13.199]  So I go in my office.
[00:26:13.199 --> 00:26:14.580]  About a day goes by, I don't look at it.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.502]  I go, okay, let me see this book.
[00:26:16.502 --> 00:26:23.469]  And I open it up, and like three pages in, the teacher seduces the eight-year-old and is having sex with him.
[00:26:23.469 --> 00:26:25.050]  And I mean, it's like porno.
[00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:25.491]  I mean, it's...
[00:26:26.937 --> 00:26:37.204]  An adult sexually assaulting a child, performing a blowjob on him, and then bending him over the table and raping him, sodomizing him.
[00:26:37.204 --> 00:26:38.685]  That's America.
[00:26:38.685 --> 00:26:43.348]  That's what 7th graders and 8th graders get in Austin, Texas.
[00:26:43.348 --> 00:26:45.109]  And it's all over the world, the same book.
[00:26:50.902 --> 00:26:54.603]  When she tried to go to city council and show it, they detained her and threw her out.
[00:26:54.603 --> 00:26:57.444]  Oh, you can't show child porn on TV.
[00:26:57.444 --> 00:26:58.005]  Exactly.
[00:26:58.005 --> 00:27:04.167]  Adults can't see it because they're showing it to children without your knowledge.
[00:27:04.167 --> 00:27:12.590]  And I'll be completely honest with you, listeners didn't mail us a bunch more books that are in bookstores and in libraries, school libraries.
[00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.810]  I won't even open them up.
[00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.311]  And that's why they're winning.
[00:27:15.311 --> 00:27:17.812]  Because we won't even, and I'll be honest, I'm weak.
[00:27:17.812 --> 00:27:18.392]  I won't look at it.
[00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:23.385]  We won't look at it.
[00:27:23.385 --> 00:27:25.926]  No one will prosecute it because it's so embarrassing.
[00:27:25.926 --> 00:27:28.507]  Because the authority figures, the schools are doing this.
[00:27:28.507 --> 00:27:34.248]  Just like they're injecting the kids with poison shots that give them blood clots and heart attacks and destroy their immune systems.
[00:27:34.248 --> 00:27:35.448]  This is death.
[00:27:35.448 --> 00:27:36.768]  This is suicide.
[00:27:36.768 --> 00:27:41.029]  This is the murder of humanity.
[00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:46.591]  But the good news is... I'm having flashbacks, man.
[00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:46.831]  It's just...
[00:27:51.547 --> 00:28:05.079]  They're trying to put fantasies in children's heads so that when an adult tries to have sex with them, when they're 10 years old, they bend over at a desk and their teacher rapes them?
[00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:08.923]  These are pedophiles running a lot of these schools.
[00:28:08.923 --> 00:28:13.767]  And they're handing your kid a book of the teacher having sex with you.
[00:28:13.767 --> 00:28:15.269]  Imagine how much worse it is.
[00:28:16.988 --> 00:28:18.129]  Then we even know.
[00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:24.796]  And that's why when these courts and these systems attack us, you need to know they're on the side of this and they support this.
[00:28:24.796 --> 00:28:26.097]  They don't have the moral high ground.
[00:28:26.097 --> 00:28:28.039]  These people are devils.
[00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:32.863]  But all we gotta do is support people fighting tyranny and withdraw support from them.
[00:28:32.863 --> 00:28:41.232]  Just withdraw support from them, have nothing to do with them, and just set up your own family, your own system, and come out of Babylon, come out of Egypt, come out of it.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.301]  All right, so that was key.
[00:28:43.301 --> 00:28:59.627]  When we come back, Roger Stone's on, but I first want to hit the attack on the, arguably, of the Mona Lisa, the most famous painting in the world, Sunflowers, attacked with red paint by leftist crazies.
[00:28:59.627 --> 00:29:02.468]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[00:29:02.468 --> 00:29:04.389]  When it comes to politics or culture,
[00:29:05.618 --> 00:29:06.238]  Economics.
[00:29:06.238 --> 00:29:09.360]  We are always the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.302]  And when we talk about the products at InfoWareStore.com, they all blow you away.
[00:29:13.302 --> 00:29:17.765]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be your big customers.
[00:29:17.765 --> 00:29:21.967]  And finally, one of our best-selling products, sold out for months, back in stock, is X3.
[00:29:21.967 --> 00:29:32.633]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[00:29:32.633 --> 00:29:35.015]  So X3, despite the fact that it's run on iodine,
[00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:37.656]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:14.154]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[00:30:14.154 --> 00:30:30.358]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[00:30:30.358 --> 00:30:33.279]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[00:30:34.173 --> 00:30:40.760]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.462]  I don't take the credit.
[00:30:42.462 --> 00:30:44.163]  I give you the credit.
[00:30:44.163 --> 00:30:46.786]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[00:30:46.786 --> 00:30:48.388]  It isn't going to give up.
[00:30:48.388 --> 00:30:50.250]  Without your support we could be shut down.
[00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.513]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[00:30:53.513 --> 00:30:57.197]  SaveInfoWars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:01.118]  Look around you.
[00:31:01.118 --> 00:31:06.140]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.021]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[00:31:10.021 --> 00:31:19.365]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[00:31:19.365 --> 00:31:25.027]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[00:31:25.027 --> 00:31:28.629]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[00:31:29.469 --> 00:31:32.575]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[00:31:32.575 --> 00:31:38.886]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[00:31:38.886 --> 00:31:40.168]  It's unsustainable.
[00:31:40.168 --> 00:31:41.390]  So please, visit.
[00:31:42.469 --> 00:31:44.451]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[00:31:44.451 --> 00:31:52.557]  SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[00:31:52.557 --> 00:31:55.559]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:56.860]  Thank you for your support.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.961]  Wouldn't be here without you.
[00:31:57.961 --> 00:31:59.422]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[00:31:59.422 --> 00:31:59.442]  X3.
[00:32:02.109 --> 00:32:03.930]  X3.
[00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.851]  It stands for tri-iodine.
[00:32:06.851 --> 00:32:12.734]  All three types of iodine that the body needs to be healthy and survive and thrive.
[00:32:12.734 --> 00:32:17.136]  It boosts your libido, your energy, your stamina, your immune system.
[00:32:17.136 --> 00:32:20.518]  X3 is the ultimate iodine product on the market.
[00:32:20.518 --> 00:32:26.421]  It's back in stock at infowarshore.com for 50% off and it funds the InfoWarp.
[00:32:27.393 --> 00:32:29.475]  So many of you are on the fence.
[00:32:29.475 --> 00:32:30.895]  You know our information is powerful.
[00:32:30.895 --> 00:32:32.176]  You know it's changed the world.

[00:32:43.224 --> 00:32:45.265]  It takes about two weeks to kick in.
[00:32:45.265 --> 00:32:47.226]  An aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes.
[00:32:47.226 --> 00:32:48.827]  Tylenol kicks in in 30 minutes.
[00:32:48.827 --> 00:32:51.549]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:53.330]  You need to experience it.
[00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.811]  Don't wait.
[00:32:54.611 --> 00:32:55.772]  You'll be impressed.
[00:32:55.772 --> 00:32:57.313]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:32:57.313 --> 00:33:01.295]  X3.
[00:33:01.295 --> 00:33:05.878]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.878 --> 00:33:17.126]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.126 --> 00:33:18.607]  Big Brother.
[00:33:18.607 --> 00:33:22.009]  Mainstream Media.
[00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:23.070]  Government Cover-Ups.
[00:33:24.605 --> 00:33:26.487]  You want answers?
[00:33:26.487 --> 00:33:28.428]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:28.428 --> 00:33:35.753]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.753 --> 00:33:46.441]  You know, I was right out of high school then, so it was 30 years ago, and a Vincent Van Gogh display came to Texas.
[00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.923]  I can't remember whether it was Dallas or Houston.
[00:33:48.923 --> 00:33:50.725]  I think it was Dallas.
[00:33:50.725 --> 00:33:53.427]  And so I went with some family and a girlfriend,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.483]  And we went in and saw Sunflowers and some of Vincent van Gogh's paintings.
[00:33:57.483 --> 00:33:59.325]  They were amazing to see in person.
[00:33:59.325 --> 00:34:13.338]  Well, to show you who the climate terrorists are, supported by the banks, supported by the media, in London, arguably the most important painting in the world, you can say it's the Sistine Chapel, you can say it's the Mona Lisa, or you can say it's Sunflowers.
[00:34:13.338 --> 00:34:15.520]  I mean, there's those three paintings, they debate about it.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.702]  I'd probably say Sistine Chapel.
[00:34:16.702 --> 00:34:18.163]  I had a chance to see that in Rome.
[00:34:18.163 --> 00:34:18.744]  It was amazing.
[00:34:21.957 --> 00:34:32.719]  You have so-called climate activists wearing nylon clothes made out of oil, with cell phones made out of oil and earth minerals, throwing tomato soup onto
[00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.380]  Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:43.846]  Now, later we learned there was a glass sheet over it, but the point is, because it's oil, and made out of oil, it's bad.
[00:34:43.846 --> 00:34:47.909]  And because, well, if we're going to kill the Earth, let's kill this painting.
[00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:50.531]  As if they're the guardians of the Earth, as if they're the bosses.
[00:34:50.531 --> 00:34:55.655]  And it's a bunch of dumbed-down college freshman girls, funded by the big banks, who want to make you guilty.
[00:34:56.716 --> 00:35:00.978]  So Al Gore and George Soros can charge you a carbon tax to track everything you're doing.
[00:35:00.978 --> 00:35:01.899]  These people are a menace.
[00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:06.821]  They block roads, they block trains, they sabotage factories, leftists like them.
[00:35:06.821 --> 00:35:11.023]  Extinction Rebellion is the ground troops of the World Economic Forum.
[00:35:11.023 --> 00:35:19.347]  Here's a clip of them attacking Vincent Van Gogh's painting.
[00:35:19.347 --> 00:35:20.508]  Security!
[00:35:22.364 --> 00:35:33.336]  You know her pink hair dye is made out of petroleum.
[00:35:33.336 --> 00:35:38.162]  They sit there and clean their hands like little demonic monkeys.
[00:35:38.162 --> 00:35:39.103]  Just say no to oil.
[00:35:41.241 --> 00:35:45.402]  Alright, so this is the ground forces.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.020]  Of the New World Order.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.042]  And their two-year climate lockdown has already killed 65 million people.
[00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:11.763]  Cutting off fossil fuels will kill billions, it's estimated.
[00:36:11.763 --> 00:36:13.584]  These are truly monsters.
[00:36:13.584 --> 00:36:18.326]  These are the idiot depopulationists of the New World Order.
[00:36:18.326 --> 00:36:21.008]  Shifting gears, they just had more congressional hearings.
[00:36:21.008 --> 00:36:30.032]  Not about the open borders, not about the war in Russia, not about nuclear war, not about devalued currencies, not about inflation, not about the Keystone Pipeline, not about the Nord Stream blown up.
[00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:39.653]  Not about the crime in the streets, but about Roger Stone with maps as him as a mastermind with Steve Bannon, even though they don't get along.
[00:36:39.653 --> 00:36:48.220]  And war rooms were all in, planning attacks, and 25 days from the midterms, it's imminent again, Roger Stone's planning something.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.281]  Meanwhile, we have CNN cuts.
[00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:54.244]  Let's get to the violence a year plus before.
[00:36:54.244 --> 00:36:54.664]  Number two,
[00:36:55.865 --> 00:36:57.286]  He renounces violence.
[00:36:57.286 --> 00:36:58.166]  And the fight between good and evil.
[00:36:58.166 --> 00:36:59.707]  We'll play these clips in a moment.
[00:36:59.707 --> 00:37:01.748]  But Roger, people can say, we know Roger's innocent.
[00:37:01.748 --> 00:37:03.468]  We know Roger didn't do anything.
[00:37:03.468 --> 00:37:04.709]  Let's move on.
[00:37:04.709 --> 00:37:11.151]  But the deep state is betting everything they've got right now on January 6th.
[00:37:11.151 --> 00:37:12.212]  What do you think they're really trying?
[00:37:13.737 --> 00:37:18.418]  Well, as you know, Alex, they've demonized me the way they've demonized you.
[00:37:18.418 --> 00:37:21.739]  And we're extremely polarizing figures.
[00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:30.561]  So they went around to various outlets, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and they said, we've got the goods on stone.
[00:37:30.561 --> 00:37:36.282]  Shocking new evidence that he was at the centerpiece of the crime, probably the mastermind.
[00:37:36.282 --> 00:37:37.782]  We're going to reveal it at the hearing.
[00:37:37.782 --> 00:37:40.243]  He'll be arrested immediately after the hearing.
[00:37:40.963 --> 00:37:48.126]  My own lawyer is getting a call from CNN saying, so your client will be enmeshed in the conspiracy today.
[00:37:48.126 --> 00:37:58.589]  We have no idea what they're talking about because any claim that I knew in advance about was involved in or condoned any illegal action on January 6th is just false.
[00:37:58.589 --> 00:38:02.171]  And sorry, there is no evidence to the contrary.
[00:38:02.171 --> 00:38:03.811]  So we're scratching our heads.
[00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:05.292]  What could this possibly be?
[00:38:06.713 --> 00:38:07.154]  I don't know.
[00:38:25.405 --> 00:38:26.826]  Guilt by association.
[00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:29.748]  Oh, well, Stone was seen with a proud boy.
[00:38:29.748 --> 00:38:31.088]  Therefore, no.
[00:38:31.088 --> 00:38:32.149]  Therefore, nothing.
[00:38:32.149 --> 00:38:34.551]  That proves nothing.
[00:38:34.551 --> 00:38:40.314]  Joshua James, one of the Oath Keepers, was in Stone's suite, they say.
[00:38:40.314 --> 00:38:43.836]  No, he delivered a suitcase to my room.
[00:38:43.836 --> 00:38:47.138]  James is a longtime associate of Stone's.
[00:38:47.138 --> 00:38:50.160]  I met this young guy on January 5th, never saw him again.
[00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:54.063]  He was charged with seditious conspiracy.
[00:38:54.063 --> 00:38:55.344]  He pled guilty.
[00:38:55.344 --> 00:38:58.606]  Doesn't mean he told me what he was going to do on the 6th.
[00:38:58.606 --> 00:39:06.412]  I never saw him past the morning of the 6th when I elected not to go to the Capitol.
[00:39:06.412 --> 00:39:08.213]  So it's a nothing burger.
[00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:10.675]  It's guilt by association.
[00:39:10.675 --> 00:39:12.917]  But Alex, here's what they know.
[00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.838]  You can be sued.
[00:39:14.838 --> 00:39:15.619]  I can be sued.
[00:39:16.403 --> 00:39:18.466]  But they have congressional immunity.
[00:39:18.466 --> 00:39:25.757]  They can tell whatever whopper of a lie they want, but you can't bring a lawsuit against them.
[00:39:25.757 --> 00:39:28.321]  You can sue witnesses before their committee.
[00:39:29.085 --> 00:39:42.739]  Who don't tell the truth, that's why these two gay Danish documentary filmmakers who have leveled accusations against me, this is why they didn't testify live, because they would have been hit with a defamation suit like that.
[00:39:42.739 --> 00:39:51.689]  Now, I'm going to sue them anyway, because in various interviews they have said that I was, quote, at the heart of a criminal conspiracy.
[00:39:52.712 --> 00:40:04.877]  In the next breath they say they have no evidence of that, even in their... Sure, so Roger, Roger, everyone knows that you didn't even, weren't there on January 6th, you stayed in your hotel room because there was so many millions of people you couldn't get out your door.
[00:40:04.877 --> 00:40:06.918]  Everybody knows you didn't do this, we know that.
[00:40:06.918 --> 00:40:10.180]  I don't know, you can put the story out, explain the history, we all know it's true.
[00:40:11.215 --> 00:40:17.937]  My question to you as a top political analyst is, even Jen Psaki said last week they should stop betting everything on January 6th.
[00:40:17.937 --> 00:40:24.159]  The polls show people care way more about inflation or crime than that, by order of magnitude.
[00:40:24.159 --> 00:40:31.481]  Like, 5% care about January 6th, 95% care about inflation, 90% care about open borders.
[00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:34.042]  So, it's a dying issue for them.
[00:40:34.042 --> 00:40:36.683]  Why are they obsessed with it?
[00:40:36.683 --> 00:40:39.284]  Because they have nothing else.
[00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:42.701]  They can't run on gas prices.
[00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:45.262]  They can't run on food shortages.
[00:40:45.262 --> 00:40:54.724]  They can't run on the open border policies that are causing a fentanyl epidemic and killing thousands of Americans every week.
[00:40:54.724 --> 00:41:07.827]  They can't run on the fact that they're shipping more and more and more billions to Ukraine when we have problems here in this country, and they're walking us right to the brink of World War III.
[00:41:08.912 --> 00:41:21.859]  They can't run on the epic inflation, which shows that if you go to the grocery store, you can spend seven bucks on a steak and it's two and a half bites.
[00:41:21.859 --> 00:41:25.100]  They can't run on any of those issues.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:33.285]  They have to obscure the fact that the President of the United States can't even string together a coherent sentence.
[00:41:33.285 --> 00:41:35.266]  They can't run on any of those things.
[00:41:35.266 --> 00:41:37.707]  So here's what this election needs to be about.
[00:41:38.803 --> 00:41:53.615]  Alex Jones, look at the coverage of your trial where you exercised your First Amendment right and you're being penalized to the tunes of a billion dollars because you exercised your right to express an opinion, which you have an absolute constitutional right to.
[00:41:53.615 --> 00:41:55.497]  I don't have to agree with you.
[00:41:55.497 --> 00:42:00.861]  People can find what you say, you know, offensive, but you still have a right to say it.
[00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:03.083]  And it's all old, it's all out of context.
[00:42:03.083 --> 00:42:03.804]  They built this up.
[00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:13.873]  Right, and they wanted it to be about me, because I'm a demon, you know, I was pardoned for lying about Russian collusion.
[00:42:14.517 --> 00:42:18.419]  Sorry folks, there was no Russian collusion to lie about.
[00:42:18.419 --> 00:42:21.780]  They want it to be about the documents at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.121]  Trump is hiding documents.
[00:42:23.121 --> 00:42:28.603]  What about the documents that Barack Obama has at a furniture warehouse in Chicago?
[00:42:28.603 --> 00:42:31.284]  Or the documents that George... And let's talk about that.
[00:42:31.284 --> 00:42:33.705]  The kangaroo, January 6th, has now subpoenaed Trump.
[00:42:33.705 --> 00:42:34.986]  That broke today.
[00:42:34.986 --> 00:42:40.468]  Where you see all this going, we've got some clips of this so-called Danish film crew with a smoking gun a year before.
[00:42:40.968 --> 00:42:41.668]  It's our bestseller.
[00:43:01.616 --> 00:43:05.359]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:14.447]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[00:43:14.447 --> 00:43:16.509]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[00:43:17.029 --> 00:43:23.691]  Vitamin-mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:30.814]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[00:43:30.814 --> 00:43:33.414]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[00:43:33.414 --> 00:43:41.497]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[00:43:41.497 --> 00:43:43.738]  Now, there are other great vitamin-mineral products out there.
[00:43:44.218 --> 00:43:48.425]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.

[00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:07.685]  Now, I knew that.

[00:46:13.798 --> 00:46:30.008]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[00:46:30.008 --> 00:46:32.930]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[00:46:33.815 --> 00:46:40.397]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:42.098]  I don't take the credit.
[00:46:42.098 --> 00:46:43.798]  I give you the credit.
[00:46:43.798 --> 00:46:46.419]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[00:46:46.419 --> 00:46:48.019]  It isn't going to give up.
[00:46:48.019 --> 00:46:49.880]  Without your support we could be shut down.

[00:47:01.098 --> 00:47:05.719]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:11.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.200]  Now you're standing there tongue-tied
[00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:31.951]  The enemy knows they're losing.
[00:47:31.951 --> 00:47:34.993]  They're throwing out all the stops now.
[00:47:34.993 --> 00:47:36.114]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[00:47:36.114 --> 00:47:42.779]  They're having wall-to-wall coverage on controlled TV that he's a mastermind of a plan to overthrow the government, steal the election.
[00:47:42.779 --> 00:47:44.119]  We know that's what they actually did.
[00:47:45.222 --> 00:47:47.583]  Roger, what does this signify at this point?
[00:47:47.583 --> 00:48:01.871]  The January 6th committee now trying to violate the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, judicial, demanding Trump now testify or be subpoenaed for their kangaroo operation.
[00:48:01.871 --> 00:48:06.473]  That's in all an effort, Alex, to make this election about Trump.
[00:48:07.539 --> 00:48:10.020]  Because that was their big takeaway.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.561]  That was their big headline.
[00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:13.942]  They subpoenaed Donald Trump.
[00:48:13.942 --> 00:48:19.744]  I can't understand any circumstances under which that would happen.
[00:48:19.744 --> 00:48:27.948]  Previous attempts by Congress to subpoena presidents have fallen entirely flat.
[00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:31.329]  What's amazing to me, and as a Texan, you'll appreciate this.
[00:48:31.329 --> 00:48:32.910]  One of the things they said yesterday was,
[00:48:34.102 --> 00:48:42.530]  Here's a video in which Roger Stone says that if Trump loses, he should declare victory anyway.
[00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:48.776]  Where what I actually said was, if it's still up in the air, Trump should declare victory.
[00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:59.749]  This is precisely the advice that James A. Baker III, former Secretary of State, former Secretary of the Treasury, gave George W. Bush in 2000.
[00:48:59.749 --> 00:49:03.290]  It is sound political and public relations advice.
[00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:07.432]  Notice I didn't say, if Trump loses, he should claim he won.
[00:49:07.432 --> 00:49:11.473]  I said, if it's up in the air, he should declare victory.
[00:49:11.853 --> 00:49:14.215]  That shows that I'm smart, not dumb.
[00:49:14.215 --> 00:49:19.918]  But it certainly doesn't show that there was some premeditated plan to declare victory.
[00:49:19.918 --> 00:49:24.941]  Well, by the way, the Democrats from Pelosi, you name it, said no matter if Trump wins, we're not going to accept it.
[00:49:24.941 --> 00:49:27.523]  We're going to have our own inauguration of Biden.
[00:49:27.523 --> 00:49:29.624]  So they were all over the place saying they weren't going to accept it.
[00:49:31.484 --> 00:49:33.626]  Exactly right, but they erased that.
[00:49:33.626 --> 00:49:45.116]  Look, Hillary Clinton and John Podesta actually tried to delay the certification of Trump's election in the Electoral College in 2016, along with 131 House Democrats.
[00:49:45.116 --> 00:49:50.300]  The Washington Post just tries to say that didn't happen, but of course it did happen.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:59.828]  So yesterday was a cornucopia of completely fabricated videos, and then they failed to show the actual videos in which
[00:50:00.488 --> 00:50:02.590]  I stood in front of the U.S.
[00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:08.894]  Supreme Court, and I specifically told people, don't be baited into violence.
[00:50:08.894 --> 00:50:10.455]  They had that video.
[00:50:10.455 --> 00:50:11.496]  Why didn't they show that video?
[00:50:11.496 --> 00:50:12.677]  It's just like my show, Charles.
[00:50:12.677 --> 00:50:15.119]  They show little 10, 15 second clips.
[00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:15.999]  Let's play these clips.
[00:50:15.999 --> 00:50:17.520]  Number one, two, and three, back to back.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.481]  You can respond.
[00:50:18.481 --> 00:50:19.722]  CNN, cut.
[00:50:19.722 --> 00:50:21.263]  Let's get to the violence.
[00:50:21.263 --> 00:50:22.624]  Number two, we renounce violence.
[00:50:22.624 --> 00:50:23.425]  They are the violent ones.
[00:50:23.425 --> 00:50:24.345]  They don't want you to see.
[00:50:24.345 --> 00:50:25.886]  Number three, fight between good and evil.
[00:50:25.886 --> 00:50:26.587]  Here's the three clips.
[00:50:30.838 --> 00:50:34.239]  Let's get right to the violence.
[00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:39.160]  Let's get right to the violence.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:50.181]  We are committed to is the truth, to speak the truth, to fight the truth, to live for the truth.
[00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:57.943]  And the truth is Donald Trump won this election.
[00:50:57.943 --> 00:50:58.483]  Tomorrow.
[00:50:59.372 --> 00:51:03.474]  When the left tries to beat you, let's be very clear.
[00:51:03.474 --> 00:51:06.675]  We renounce violence.
[00:51:06.675 --> 00:51:08.856]  They are the violent ones.
[00:51:08.856 --> 00:51:11.017]  Let's be very clear.
[00:51:11.017 --> 00:51:17.100]  This is not an election between Republicans and Democrats.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.542]  This is not a fight between liberals and conservatives.
[00:51:21.542 --> 00:51:28.886]  This is nothing less than an epic struggle for the future of this country between dark and light.
[00:51:30.492 --> 00:51:34.274]  Between the godly and the godless.
[00:51:34.274 --> 00:51:37.935]  Between good and evil.
[00:51:37.935 --> 00:51:46.779]  And we will win this fight or America will step off into a thousand years of darkness.
[00:51:46.779 --> 00:51:50.300]  We dare not fail.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.502]  So, that's what they've got on you, Roger.
[00:51:54.502 --> 00:51:55.142]  You're quite the villain.
[00:51:56.187 --> 00:52:01.591]  So Alex, in that first video, did you see me or see my mouth moving any place?
[00:52:01.591 --> 00:52:02.351]  No.
[00:52:02.351 --> 00:52:04.013]  We can play those short videos again.
[00:52:04.013 --> 00:52:07.875]  The best they've got is edited five second clips.
[00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:08.976]  But don't even show your face.
[00:52:08.976 --> 00:52:11.478]  You're saying these are fake clips.
[00:52:11.478 --> 00:52:12.819]  That's a fabrication.
[00:52:12.819 --> 00:52:17.882]  A week ago, they had no visual.
[00:52:17.882 --> 00:52:22.946]  Then in the version they showed at the hearing yesterday, they have showed
[00:52:23.886 --> 00:52:25.810]  Visual of me wearing a mask.
[00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:29.296]  But the digital soundtrack is exactly the same.
[00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:31.700]  That's a fabrication.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.443]  It's a complete fraud.
[00:52:34.699 --> 00:52:44.345]  And I'll prove that in federal court, because I'm bringing a $25 million lawsuit against these two fugazi Danish filmmakers.
[00:52:44.345 --> 00:52:47.648]  That is entirely fabricated.
[00:52:47.648 --> 00:52:54.512]  And they very cleverly put the visuals on there.
[00:52:54.512 --> 00:53:00.776]  So we have Democrats calling for confronting people, being violent, mostly peaceful, burned down cities, all this.
[00:53:00.776 --> 00:53:02.097]  They're good, and now they have
[00:53:02.757 --> 00:53:06.058]  Five second clips of you just saying the violence or something.
[00:53:06.058 --> 00:53:08.379]  It's a joke.
[00:53:08.379 --> 00:53:11.579]  Which I will prove in a federal court is not even real.
[00:53:11.579 --> 00:53:14.080]  We've done the digital analysis.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:21.182]  Both soundtracks are the same audio, but they invented the second visual to try to tie me in.
[00:53:21.182 --> 00:53:21.982]  I'm wearing a mask.
[00:53:21.982 --> 00:53:25.003]  You can't see anyone's mouth moving.
[00:53:25.003 --> 00:53:26.184]  It's a fraud.
[00:53:26.184 --> 00:53:27.364]  It's just a completely fraud.
[00:53:28.244 --> 00:53:31.987]  I should say I am working on cleaning up my language.
[00:53:31.987 --> 00:53:34.349]  Even if the F-bomb's there, I didn't really say.
[00:53:34.349 --> 00:53:37.932]  I really need to be somewhat more circumspect.
[00:53:37.932 --> 00:53:40.914]  I promised my wife and my pastor I will work on it.
[00:53:40.914 --> 00:53:45.658]  Well, but I mean, here are all these people constantly recording us and then putting out little snippets.
[00:53:45.658 --> 00:53:49.241]  In my show trials, they play five-second clips.
[00:53:49.241 --> 00:53:52.123]  And they know exactly what they're doing, so it's total desperateness.
[00:53:54.193 --> 00:53:58.156]  Yet, we saw Chuck Schumer threaten violence against the U.S.
[00:53:58.156 --> 00:53:59.217]  Supreme Court.
[00:53:59.217 --> 00:54:01.098]  We've seen that video.
[00:54:01.098 --> 00:54:02.699]  But he won't be prosecuted.
[00:54:02.699 --> 00:54:10.625]  There's Maxine Waters, the multi-millionaire congresswoman who doesn't live in her district in California.
[00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:12.706]  She advocates violence.
[00:54:12.706 --> 00:54:14.007]  You'll find no controversy.
[00:54:14.007 --> 00:54:14.928]  No, but I agree with you.
[00:54:14.928 --> 00:54:16.409]  They have nothing else but this.
[00:54:16.409 --> 00:54:17.690]  They keep pushing it.
[00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:19.871]  But even Psaki said last week they should stop it.
[00:54:19.871 --> 00:54:20.872]  It's not working in the polls.
[00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:32.763]  There's no poll information, but I'm absolutely convinced this is why they have made the news regarding your trial has gotten such wall-to-wall coverage.
[00:54:32.763 --> 00:54:43.468]  They want this election to be about Donald Trump or Alex Jones or Roger Stone or documents at Mar-a-Lago or January 6th.
[00:54:44.468 --> 00:54:49.890]  And you and I have both been demonized by an extraordinary hostile press.
[00:54:49.890 --> 00:55:00.332]  Thank God we have InfoWars as a beacon of freedom, as a platform for us to punch back or we'd have no place to mount our defense.
[00:55:00.332 --> 00:55:03.913]  Not Twitter, not Facebook, not Instagram.
[00:55:03.913 --> 00:55:07.394]  So this is why InfoWars is so important.
[00:55:08.268 --> 00:55:09.288]  All right, Roger.
[00:55:09.288 --> 00:55:11.509]  Well, I'm doing a special emergency broadcast tomorrow.
[00:55:11.509 --> 00:55:13.109]  If you've got time, tape with us.
[00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:15.430]  This is a live show right now, but we're going to have tape tomorrow.
[00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:20.291]  I'm doing the nuclear war crisis and the admitted COVID camps run by the U.N.
[00:55:20.291 --> 00:55:20.811]  all over the world.
[00:55:20.811 --> 00:55:23.892]  They're planning during nuclear war to round us up all in.
[00:55:23.892 --> 00:55:26.633]  That'll start airing tomorrow at 1 p.m.
[00:55:26.633 --> 00:55:28.393]  Central Standard Time.
[00:55:28.393 --> 00:55:30.134]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:55:30.134 --> 00:55:31.214]  God bless you, Roger.
[00:55:31.214 --> 00:55:31.594]  Be safe.
[00:55:33.014 --> 00:55:34.076]  Alex, absolutely.
[00:55:34.076 --> 00:55:36.519]  I would love to join you for tomorrow's broadcast.
[00:55:36.519 --> 00:55:37.580]  I am free.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:40.664]  Folks, go to stonedefensefund.com.
[00:55:40.664 --> 00:55:42.226]  It's not that I'm trying to make a profit.
[00:55:42.226 --> 00:55:44.408]  It's that I'm trying to defend myself.
[00:55:44.408 --> 00:55:52.118]  I have $100,000 in new legal bills just based on the false allegations made against me yesterday.
[00:55:52.458 --> 00:55:54.860]  But I will never stop fighting.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:56:04.568]  And while you're at it, folks, go to the InfoWars store right now, buy a great product or make a contribution because InfoWars is the point of the spear.
[00:56:04.568 --> 00:56:07.110]  We are the tip of the spear.
[00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:19.540]  And if it weren't for a great platform like this, I wouldn't have any place that I can go to punch back at the CNN, MSNBC, Democrat fake news media cabal.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:20.360]  Well, that's right.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:20.960]  Thank you, Roger.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.741]  God bless you.
[00:56:21.741 --> 00:56:22.501]  They failed.
[00:56:22.501 --> 00:56:23.361]  They've collapsed.
[00:56:23.361 --> 00:56:24.101]  They're a joke.
[00:56:24.101 --> 00:56:24.921]  They know it.
[00:56:24.921 --> 00:56:27.862]  Their number one mission is silence us at any cost.
[00:56:27.862 --> 00:56:29.703]  And folks, we don't want to complain.
[00:56:29.703 --> 00:56:32.104]  You don't know about one-tenth the attacks behind the scene.
[00:56:32.104 --> 00:56:33.304]  But I'm so excited.
[00:56:33.304 --> 00:56:34.164]  I'm so emboldened.
[00:56:34.164 --> 00:56:35.304]  I'm so empowered.
[00:56:35.304 --> 00:56:38.925]  I'm so buoyed right now because I know humanity is waking up.
[00:56:38.925 --> 00:56:40.286]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[00:56:40.286 --> 00:56:43.807]  And we'll take 30 minutes commercial free with Roger tomorrow.
[00:56:43.807 --> 00:56:45.047]  I come in at 10 a.m.
[00:56:45.047 --> 00:56:47.208]  and I've got a bunch of big guests, a bunch of big analysis.
[00:56:48.362 --> 00:56:51.624]  We'll have it all tomorrow airing at 1 p.m.
[00:56:51.624 --> 00:56:54.666]  Central Standard Time.
[00:56:54.666 --> 00:57:01.890]  All right, we've got Adam Curry coming up to talk about the digital currency, the world government, how to stop it, and then David Icke coming up.
[00:57:03.228 --> 00:57:04.869]  And so much more here today.
[00:57:04.869 --> 00:57:08.050]  And yes, listeners, you can see we're at the quickening.
[00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:09.650]  We're at the 12th round of the fight.
[00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:11.471]  We're in the last inning of the baseball game.
[00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:17.253]  This is the most critical time to be informed, to be engaged, and to be involved that we've ever been.
[00:57:17.253 --> 00:57:27.037]  So all I ask is for your prayers that you share the live links to InfoWars.com and InfoWars.com forward slash show and band video and that yes, if you want to
[00:57:28.186 --> 00:57:29.727]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[00:57:29.727 --> 00:57:31.208]  When it comes to politics or culture,
[00:57:55.498 --> 00:57:59.240]  Economics, we are always the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.183]  And when we talk about the products at InfoWareStore.com, they all blow you away.
[00:58:03.183 --> 00:58:07.645]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be with me customers.
[00:58:07.645 --> 00:58:11.868]  And finally, one of our best selling products, sold out for months, it's back in stock, it's X3.
[00:58:11.868 --> 00:58:22.534]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[00:58:22.534 --> 00:58:24.896]  So X3, despite the fact that it's run on iodine,
[00:58:25.496 --> 00:58:34.782]  It's still on sale at 50% off right now at InfoWarStore.com and it funds the Info War, which is a 360 win.
[00:58:34.782 --> 00:58:41.327]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick it on average, you've got to go to InfoWarStore.com and get X3 50% off.
[00:58:41.327 --> 00:58:42.047]  X3 50% off, InfoWarStore.com.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.583]  Look, it's not hype that InfoWars has changed the world.
[00:58:52.583 --> 00:58:57.127]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars is the reason we were able to do this.
[00:58:57.127 --> 00:58:58.808]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[00:58:58.808 --> 00:59:02.731]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[00:59:02.731 --> 00:59:06.614]  Well, high-quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[00:59:06.614 --> 00:59:17.704]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells, doesn't just give you more energy, doesn't just boost your immune system, but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[00:59:18.164 --> 00:59:26.608]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average, taking a few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[00:59:26.608 --> 00:59:28.088]  Plus it funds the Infowar.
[00:59:28.088 --> 00:59:31.890]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?
[00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:39.253]  Experience X3, finally back in stock at InfowarStore.com right now for 50% off.
[00:59:39.253 --> 00:59:41.494]  Experience Tri-Ionine.
[00:59:41.494 --> 00:59:45.756]  Learn about the Ionine Fluoride Conspiracy, learn how to counter the fluoride, and find
[00:59:45.936 --> 00:59:46.596]  We're good to go.
[01:00:17.563 --> 01:00:26.045]  So, the globalists, the Adam Curry, David Iken reviews are coming up here next segment.
[01:00:26.045 --> 01:00:29.666]  Hit you with a bio-weapon that gives you a heart attack, some myocarditis and blood clots.
[01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:35.907]  And don't worry, the CEO confirms new mRNA injection repair heart muscles after heart attack.
[01:00:35.907 --> 01:00:38.848]  So they give you a heart attack, they give you the solution to it.
[01:00:38.848 --> 01:00:40.408]  And here's another headline of the LA Times.
[01:00:41.994 --> 01:00:48.317]  Why the war in Ukraine has countless different countries stockpiling iodine tablets?
[01:00:48.317 --> 01:00:51.758]  Why the war in Ukraine has countries stockpiling iodine tablets?
[01:00:51.758 --> 01:00:56.840]  Because that protects you from some of the radioactive isotopes that are most common when a hydrogen bomb goes off.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.082]  We don't sell X3 to protect you from radiation.
[01:01:01.082 --> 01:01:06.884]  We sell X3 because iodine that's true and pure and has all three good types is so amazing for your body.
[01:01:08.305 --> 01:01:12.527]  Your energy, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, and yes, your thyroid.
[01:01:12.527 --> 01:01:13.368]  That's a game changer.
[01:01:13.368 --> 01:01:21.332]  But I told you a few weeks ago when it came back in, I said there's a huge run on X3, it's going to sell out soon, but despite that, it's 50% off.
[01:01:21.332 --> 01:01:30.457]  We could be sold out in a week at current sales rates, but I'm still keeping it at 50% off because I want those that haven't experienced, takes about two weeks to kick in, what it does for energy, stamina, libido, everything.
[01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.551]  But it's not 50% off right now.
[01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:35.231]  It was.
[01:01:35.231 --> 01:01:40.013]  It's 60% off with promo code 1776.
[01:01:40.013 --> 01:01:40.333]  1776.
[01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:43.875]  And the enemy works around the clock to shut our money off and destroy us.
[01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:51.679]  But if I can sell a great product that empowers you and your body and your life force and your immune system and your energy and your stamina, then it's a win-win.
[01:01:51.679 --> 01:01:53.980]  Go to infowarestore.com right now.
[01:01:55.404 --> 01:01:56.004]  We're good to go.
[01:02:13.908 --> 01:02:14.709]  Are you kidding me?

[01:02:57.039 --> 01:03:02.504]  1776, it is, 60% off, and the enemy is in full fits.
[01:03:02.504 --> 01:03:04.085]  Their lawsuits haven't worked.
[01:03:04.085 --> 01:03:05.506]  Their attacks haven't worked.
[01:03:05.506 --> 01:03:08.688]  Their criminal investigations haven't worked, because we're so clean.
[01:03:08.688 --> 01:03:16.214]  They are in full panic mode, and they want this broadcast off the air ahead of what they're about to launch, election theft, in 25 days.
[01:03:16.214 --> 01:03:19.257]  We are so close to winning a major battle.
[01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:23.160]  I've seen the wars won yet, Chrysler won that war, but God is watching us.
[01:03:24.332 --> 01:03:24.753]  I don't know.
[01:03:36.803 --> 01:03:41.465]  To take the articles and the videos, the most important information, from InfoWars.com and share it.
[01:03:41.465 --> 01:03:56.210]  And to tell folks at those local AM and FM stations, those local TV stations, and to pray for a global awakening, and to pray for peace and justice, and for a stop to World War III, and to then support InfoWarsTour.com while getting products that will blow you away.
[01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:57.231]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:03:57.231 --> 01:03:59.271]  60% off with promo code 1776.
[01:04:01.232 --> 01:04:04.974]  X3, 60% off, promo code 7076.
[01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:08.876]  Biomineral Fusion, 60% off, with promo code 7076.
[01:04:08.876 --> 01:04:16.301]  Take action, fund us, and we will never back down, we will never give in, and with your support, we will never give out.
[01:04:16.301 --> 01:04:17.941]  Alright.
[01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:18.522]  We're gonna go on a break.
[01:04:19.482 --> 01:04:28.125]  We're going to come back with Adam Curry on the digital currency and New World Order, and then David Icke is scheduled to be coming up as well on the nature of reality, how to break free from the Matrix.
[01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:30.366]  I want to salute and thank this crew as well.
[01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:33.988]  They are doing a kick-ass job.
[01:04:33.988 --> 01:04:35.148]  Woo!
[01:04:35.148 --> 01:04:38.309]  And then tomorrow, 1 p.m.
[01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:40.170]  Central, I'm going to tape a special show.
[01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:41.511]  Tomorrow, I'll tape it.
[01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:43.852]  A special broadcast to air at 1 p.m.
[01:04:43.852 --> 01:04:44.832]  Central.
[01:04:44.832 --> 01:04:47.033]  And the real magic is when you take it and share it.
[01:04:48.015 --> 01:04:48.615]  I salute you.
[01:04:48.615 --> 01:04:49.916]  You really are the tip of the spear.
[01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:51.116]  You are the resistance.
[01:04:51.116 --> 01:04:52.197]  We are a family.
[01:04:52.197 --> 01:04:53.097]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:59.820]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.661]  It's our bestseller.
[01:05:01.661 --> 01:05:05.423]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:14.487]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[01:05:14.487 --> 01:05:16.548]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[01:05:17.088 --> 01:05:23.734]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[01:05:23.734 --> 01:05:30.860]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.483]  Essential means without these things you die.
[01:05:33.483 --> 01:05:41.570]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.792]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[01:05:44.272 --> 01:05:48.477]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.
[01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:56.246]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting Vitamineral Fusion finally back in stock at InfoWareStore.com for 50% off.
[01:05:56.246 --> 01:05:58.929]  Vitamineral Fusion, back in stock, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:03.243 --> 01:06:10.329]  Again, I know we have record numbers of new listeners and viewers tuning in for the Forbidden Broadcast.
[01:06:10.329 --> 01:06:16.434]  We're now to the hour number two on this Friday, October 14th, 2022 transmission.
[01:06:16.434 --> 01:06:27.624]  Tomorrow, I'm going to be up here at 10 a.m., and I'm going to tape till past noon or so, and then we'll start streaming it by, I would guess, one o'clock, and then post it to Band.Video.
[01:06:27.624 --> 01:06:29.746]  I'm going to do a two-hour commercial-free
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:45.665]  Emergency broadcast on the threat of nuclear war and also how governments under UN control have built under the guise of COVID camps, relocation, political prisoner camps and their admissions of that.
[01:06:45.665 --> 01:06:53.307]  So tomorrow, commercial free, because I want to be able to roll all this out, play all the clips, show the documents, cover the evidence.
[01:06:53.307 --> 01:06:59.109]  I'm going to blow everybody away and break some of the biggest news ever.
[01:06:59.109 --> 01:07:00.229]  And again, we'll start taping
[01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:06.055]  At about 1030 or so, we'll be done in two hours.
[01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:08.639]  It'll start streaming at one o'clock, two o'clock tomorrow, not sure when.
[01:07:08.639 --> 01:07:12.024]  It's got a lot of documents and information to it.
[01:07:12.024 --> 01:07:15.730]  So look for that tomorrow, Saturday, the 15th of October.
[01:07:16.351 --> 01:07:30.902]  We're about to go to Adam Curry, the inventor of podcasting, famous talk show host in his own right, on the Cashless Society, on the New World Order, on what PayPal is doing and how it's the model of this social credit score and so much more.
[01:07:30.902 --> 01:07:43.811]  And then a huge interview that we taped a few weeks ago that we're going to premiere here live on air with David Icke that is super in-depth and extremely powerful about the nature of reality.
[01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:47.126]  So that's all coming up and so much more.
[01:07:47.126 --> 01:07:49.689]  Please remember, the only way we stay on air is your support.
[01:07:49.689 --> 01:07:50.690]  I salute you for your support.
[01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:55.076]  An additional 10% off of the Big Mega Sale right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:07:56.272 --> 01:08:04.417]  With promo code 1776, an additional 10% off on X3, on Vitamineral Fusion, and on so much more.
[01:08:04.417 --> 01:08:05.698]  And again, that's how we stay on air.
[01:08:05.698 --> 01:08:07.439]  That's how we battle these people.
[01:08:07.439 --> 01:08:09.501]  They've been lying and saying, we're going away.
[01:08:09.501 --> 01:08:10.101]  We're bankrupt.
[01:08:10.101 --> 01:08:11.602]  We got to pay a billion dollars.
[01:08:11.602 --> 01:08:12.883]  None of that's true.
[01:08:12.883 --> 01:08:14.404]  Two men can't have a baby.
[01:08:14.404 --> 01:08:15.885]  This is all a fraud.
[01:08:15.885 --> 01:08:16.966]  They can't silence us.
[01:08:16.966 --> 01:08:20.968]  They can't take us off air unless they kill me or put me in prison, which they're trying to do.
[01:08:20.968 --> 01:08:22.149]  So as long as you support
[01:08:22.759 --> 01:08:22.999]  I think so.

[01:09:03.826 --> 01:09:04.786]  Encourage those of you that have it.
[01:09:04.786 --> 01:09:05.867]  It's a limited edition.
[01:09:05.867 --> 01:09:07.107]  It is a fundraiser coin.
[01:09:07.107 --> 01:09:14.030]  Just like you get an unsigned book for 20-something bucks at The Great Reset at InfoWarsTore.com or a signed book for $99.
[01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:15.170]  It's the fundraising.
[01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:15.831]  It's the history.
[01:09:15.831 --> 01:09:16.971]  It's that piece of history.
[01:09:16.971 --> 01:09:19.672]  The coin is like the book, and it's a limited edition.
[01:09:19.672 --> 01:09:21.613]  It'll be sold out soon.
[01:09:21.613 --> 01:09:22.553]  1776coin.com.
[01:09:22.553 --> 01:09:30.616]  And speaking of 1776, again, you can get $10 off on the signed book at InfoWarsTore.com, The Great Reset and War for the World with promo code 1776 as well.
[01:09:33.331 --> 01:09:36.614]  Here is the Adam Curry interview that I taped recently.
[01:09:36.614 --> 01:09:38.256]  We're premiering it here on air.
[01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:41.419]  And then David Icke is coming up and so much more.
[01:09:41.419 --> 01:09:42.039]  Please stay with us.
[01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:14.311]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this emergency Saturday broadcast.
[01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:21.936]  When I say emergency, you see we are in a growing, intensifying emergency.
[01:10:21.936 --> 01:10:23.377]  Geopolitically, war
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:29.982]  Proxy wars, destabilized borders, collapsing currencies.
[01:10:29.982 --> 01:10:31.142]  The list goes on and on.
[01:10:31.142 --> 01:10:41.927]  And you have Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum admitting, out of these global crises, they are bringing in their Great Reset and their New World Order Agenda 2030.
[01:10:41.927 --> 01:10:49.490]  If we're going to be looking at Russia, I told you two weeks ago, look for a massive, massive escalation.
[01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:55.850]  Now the pipelines are both been, one blown up, one damaged, Nord Stream 1 and 2.
[01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:58.891]  Now they're talking about other pipelines are probably going to get destroyed.
[01:10:58.891 --> 01:11:04.254]  You've got other European pipelines turning on the same day that Nord Stream was blown up.
[01:11:04.254 --> 01:11:15.559]  You have Russia threatening nuclear war, Putin saying he's not bluffing, and in the background of this, we have the private Federal Reserve, we have the head of the European Union, all the big banking heads saying,
[01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:21.246]  That they're soon going to roll out these digital programmable currencies.
[01:11:21.246 --> 01:11:32.176]  I was driving down the highway the other morning, and I was flipping through the AM dial and came across 1200 OAI, and I heard a voice I recognized.
[01:11:32.176 --> 01:11:38.481]  And then I drove under an overpass right as they were going to break, and I didn't hear who he was talking to, but I said, I know this guy.
[01:11:38.481 --> 01:11:39.462]  This guy is so smart.
[01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:40.243]  I got to get him on.
[01:11:40.243 --> 01:11:41.084]  Who is it?
[01:11:41.084 --> 01:11:43.005]  They come back, do another segment.
[01:11:43.005 --> 01:11:43.626]  It's Adam Curry.
[01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:46.349]  And I'm like, oh my gosh, I gotta beg Adam to come on.
[01:11:46.349 --> 01:11:47.249]  He's such a busy guy.
[01:11:47.249 --> 01:11:51.092]  He is credited as being the creator or the first podcaster.
[01:11:51.092 --> 01:11:59.939]  He's also a super smart guy, and of course, well-known for being the number one host when they kicked off MTV back when it was the biggest thing in the world.
[01:11:59.939 --> 01:12:08.126]  And he joins us now for a 50-minute transmission, noagendashow.com, to get into the entire waterfront.
[01:12:09.269 --> 01:12:09.469]  You think?
[01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:25.282]  Yeah, sure Alex.
[01:12:25.282 --> 01:12:25.822]  Always good to see you, man.
[01:12:45.757 --> 01:12:46.559]  Where do you want to start?
[01:12:46.559 --> 01:12:57.340]  Because I'm going to try to just shut up and let you roll, because the way you laid out the digital currencies, the way you lay out everything, I mean, I listen to the show routinely, but the way you laid it out on Glenn Beck was amazing, and I wanted to give you more time.
[01:12:59.277 --> 01:13:01.299]  Yeah, and I'm not a financial guy, obviously.
[01:13:01.299 --> 01:13:09.567]  I would say because of my interest in Bitcoin is kind of how I learn more and more about the financial system.
[01:13:09.567 --> 01:13:11.809]  And this goes back to Ron Paul's End the Fed.
[01:13:11.809 --> 01:13:14.672]  That's where I really started to understand what the Federal Reserve does.
[01:13:14.672 --> 01:13:17.774]  And so and that's, you know, that's now what is it?
[01:13:17.774 --> 01:13:18.095]  15 years.
[01:13:18.095 --> 01:13:20.016]  It's been quite a while since that book.
[01:13:20.016 --> 01:13:21.478]  But what I'm seeing, Alex, is
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:27.465]  The way it's presented in the media, what's going on right now is upside down.
[01:13:27.465 --> 01:13:38.978]  What we continuously hear is because of Putin, because of the war in Ukraine, because of COVID, these are all the reasons that the financial system is in turmoil.
[01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:41.106]  But that's upside down.
[01:13:41.106 --> 01:13:45.389]  We have all of these things happening because of the financial system.
[01:13:45.389 --> 01:13:55.716]  And that's the part that frustrates me when I see how it's reported, is all of this, all problems stem from the financial system as it is kind of
[01:13:56.371 --> 01:14:00.593]  I mean, it seems like it's coming to its end, this version of the system.
[01:14:00.593 --> 01:14:05.535]  And we've had many versions of financial systems for the United States dollar.
[01:14:05.535 --> 01:14:10.056]  We were at one point on the gold standard and the 70s were taken off the gold standard.
[01:14:10.056 --> 01:14:15.758]  And if you think the government won't mess with your money, I mean, there was an actual gold confiscation.
[01:14:15.758 --> 01:14:18.900]  It was illegal to have gold or gold coins.
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:19.860]  You had to give it up.
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.121]  So, you know, anything can change ultimately.
[01:14:23.499 --> 01:14:45.289]  But now we're in a world where I think unfortunately the money creation has just gotten out of control and that is truly, you know, the parameters for inflation are money creation and something called the velocity of money, so how fast people are spending money that they get into their hands.
[01:14:46.129 --> 01:14:58.018]  That has been bastardized and turned into something called, you know, the Consumer Price Index, and it only looks at the cost of gas and the cost of food.
[01:14:58.018 --> 01:14:59.939]  But really, that's not what the problem is.
[01:14:59.939 --> 01:15:06.184]  And of all the US dollars ever created, ever brought into existence,
[01:15:06.904 --> 01:15:08.506]  Ever, since the beginning.
[01:15:08.506 --> 01:15:12.770]  40% was created in the last two years.
[01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:24.841]  And this is something that I did learn in high school, and I think everyone kind of agrees, if you have X amount of money and X amount of goods, there's price discovery.
[01:15:24.841 --> 01:15:29.786]  If everybody has a lot more money, then the prices will have to change.
[01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:32.827]  So it's the supply and demand.
[01:15:32.827 --> 01:15:38.970]  And we just got into this perfect situation, which now, in my opinion, is just being exasperated.
[01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:55.198]  And just to prove that it's a financial issue, the first thing that they did as this started, well, in my opinion, we probably shut down the economy as the first way to stop the bleeding, since hyperinflation can actually happen.
[01:15:55.198 --> 01:15:58.480]  And that was probably the main reason behind the...
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.901]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[01:16:12.637 --> 01:16:16.939]  You'll just take them, you'll just try them, I know you'll be one of the big customers.
[01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:21.161]  And finally, one of our best selling products, sold out for months, it's back in stock, it's X3.
[01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:31.806]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[01:16:31.806 --> 01:16:37.208]  So X3, despite the fact it was run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now.
[01:16:38.609 --> 01:16:39.550]  I think so.
[01:16:58.854 --> 01:17:00.415]  Look around you.
[01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:05.437]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[01:17:05.437 --> 01:17:09.339]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[01:17:09.339 --> 01:17:18.664]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[01:17:18.664 --> 01:17:24.327]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[01:17:24.327 --> 01:17:27.929]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.875]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[01:17:31.875 --> 01:17:38.186]  But I'm being forced by the Bankruptcy Court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:39.468]  It's unsustainable.
[01:17:39.468 --> 01:17:40.690]  So please, visit.
[01:17:41.773 --> 01:17:43.756]  SaveInfoWars.com.

[01:18:19.767 --> 01:18:24.231]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[01:18:24.231 --> 01:18:25.492]  And I need your support.
[01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:32.899]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:41.965]  And SaveInfoWars.com takes you to a URL at GiveSendGo for direct Alex Jones Legal Defense Fund.
[01:18:41.965 --> 01:18:46.487]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[01:18:46.487 --> 01:18:50.729]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[01:18:50.729 --> 01:18:58.553]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and justice in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[01:18:58.553 --> 01:19:00.054]  We've all heard of interventions.
[01:19:00.674 --> 01:19:03.595]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[01:19:03.595 --> 01:19:10.458]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people don't listen, and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[01:19:23.403 --> 01:19:25.385]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[01:19:25.385 --> 01:19:26.907]  I don't plan to be Mr. Health.
[01:19:26.907 --> 01:19:35.035]  But if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWarshaw.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[01:19:35.035 --> 01:19:39.179]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible.
[01:19:39.679 --> 01:19:46.403]  And despite the fact that selling out X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:46.403 --> 01:19:49.065]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[01:19:49.065 --> 01:19:50.326]  We're not selling it for that.
[01:19:50.326 --> 01:19:53.788]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:57.371]  Get X3 today, 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:57.371 --> 01:19:59.512]  All supplies last.
[01:19:59.512 --> 01:20:05.416]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:33.503]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.503 --> 01:20:37.965]  Now, we come out of this, and there's no way to stop it.
[01:20:37.965 --> 01:20:41.046]  You can't get it under control.
[01:20:41.046 --> 01:20:52.211]  So, we have to be able to control the money at a more granular level, and that is why you hear all this talk of the CBDC or the Central Bank Digital Currency.
[01:20:53.111 --> 01:20:56.932]  Because they'll tackle the problem from the opposite end.
[01:20:56.932 --> 01:21:06.274]  Whereas now they can really, you know, create and destroy dollars to manage inflation and thus somehow the economy and the prices.
[01:21:06.274 --> 01:21:13.256]  They want to now, in essence, have control over your money so they can remove money from you, small increments, you won't know it.
[01:21:13.256 --> 01:21:19.397]  Or, when they put money in, they can basically determine where it's going to be spent.
[01:21:19.397 --> 01:21:19.757]  And this
[01:21:21.013 --> 01:21:23.016]  And, you know, we'll have to get into the details.
[01:21:23.016 --> 01:21:32.089]  This all comes back in my mind to this drive towards the green, you know, carbon neutral or net neutral economy.
[01:21:33.699 --> 01:21:39.681]  That is now, and all the actions in the European Union, they're ahead of us right now.
[01:21:39.681 --> 01:21:42.942]  They are reigniting their carbon markets.
[01:21:42.942 --> 01:21:49.805]  So the basic concept is your money will be controlled based upon your carbon footprint.
[01:21:49.805 --> 01:21:56.167]  So you will be given personal responsibility to do the right thing if you want to
[01:21:57.461 --> 01:22:03.303]  Access your money in the way that the government now, in fact, intends.
[01:22:03.303 --> 01:22:05.984]  And it sounds really far out there.
[01:22:05.984 --> 01:22:16.529]  And I don't know about you, Alex, but every single time I look at something and say, crap, they're doing this, like vaccines, you know, all these things, it kind of comes into play 10 years later.
[01:22:16.529 --> 01:22:20.410]  So I don't know if this is going to happen in 10 years.
[01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:24.652]  Powell, the chairman of the Fed, he said, well, you know, central bank digital currency, we're looking at it.
[01:22:25.192 --> 01:22:27.195]  Probably three years away.
[01:22:27.195 --> 01:22:36.545]  But Christine Lagarde, who is the Powell of the European Central Bank, she made it sound recently at an Atlantic Council interview like it was kind of happening.
[01:22:36.545 --> 01:22:45.975]  And what was creepy there is she said the way they're pitching this is credit cards track you.
[01:22:47.163 --> 01:22:55.252]  Credit cards build a profile of you and these are exploited commercially to sell things to you and know what you're doing.
[01:22:55.252 --> 01:22:58.315]  And she says, our central bank digital currency, it won't do that.
[01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:05.757]  Not that they won't be tracking and building a profile of you, but they won't sell it to commercial companies.
[01:23:05.757 --> 01:23:07.939]  But the government could do a heck of a lot with that.
[01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:17.010]  So this digital twin profile, they want to build that and they want to know who you are and subsequently how to control you.
[01:23:18.135 --> 01:23:27.925]  And you walked through that when I heard you on the radio the other day, and you made the point, this is not your opinion, this is not something that's just we're surmising they could do this.
[01:23:27.925 --> 01:23:38.435]  They're saying in these IMF, World Bank, Federal Reserve, and also BlackRock statements that also what the Bank of England came out about a month ago, I guess down two months ago and said,
[01:23:39.115 --> 01:23:46.263]  Oh, we're going to program the tokens, and we're going to program these new digital systems, and we'll decide when you can spend it, how you can spend it.
[01:23:46.263 --> 01:23:48.846]  We'll put it in your account, and then maybe it has two days.
[01:23:48.846 --> 01:23:55.152]  That way we can have stimulus, or we can take some of the value out of it if we want to slow things down.
[01:23:55.152 --> 01:24:00.078]  I mean, this is total surveillance, total control, and you bring in the SEGs,
[01:24:00.698 --> 01:24:10.905]  With all these big private corporations and banks and BlackRock and then central banks admitting that they're also going to tell you where you can spend it and how you can spend it, quote, for the environment.
[01:24:10.905 --> 01:24:13.267]  But really, it's to send the money right back to themselves.
[01:24:15.034 --> 01:24:16.836]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:24:16.836 --> 01:24:25.762]  Yes, the environmental social governance regulations that kind of came out of nowhere, I think, you know, I really started tuning into it about a year ago.
[01:24:25.762 --> 01:24:28.043]  It's like, wow, this is this thing is real.
[01:24:28.043 --> 01:24:40.212]  They, in essence, made their own ranking system and their own little way of determining if you as a company are good at environmental goals, if you're good at social goals, which would be
[01:24:41.093 --> 01:24:41.794]  Thank you.
[01:24:57.593 --> 01:25:04.380]  And since they make the rules, they can, in essence, determine who's going to get investments or not.
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:09.805]  Because when you look at the true investment market out in Wall Street, it's pension funds.
[01:25:09.805 --> 01:25:10.826]  These are the biggest ones.
[01:25:10.826 --> 01:25:16.271]  Pension funds, retirement funds, and they're the ones that are then making these decisions.
[01:25:16.271 --> 01:25:21.376]  And if the so-called rules, which just kind of came into existence like many other rules in our country,
[01:25:22.477 --> 01:25:30.946]  Well, you know, you can't invest in fracking, you can't invest in pipelines or anything of this nature, then that investment won't go in there.
[01:25:30.946 --> 01:25:36.332]  And to me, it feels also like there's a lot of subplots here.
[01:25:36.332 --> 01:25:41.018]  Right now, Europe is, and I have a lot of friends who live there, it's chaos.
[01:25:44.541 --> 01:25:48.604]  People's energy bills, just for electricity, have doubled in Germany.
[01:25:48.604 --> 01:25:51.166]  They're close to quadrupling in the UK as well.
[01:25:51.166 --> 01:25:54.348]  You know, this gets people's attention.
[01:25:54.348 --> 01:25:59.432]  And so they're focused on, oh, it's because of Ukraine, it's because of Putin, they throw all that out there.
[01:25:59.432 --> 01:26:06.717]  But, you know, really, it's your fault because, you know, we shouldn't be using these horrible things to heat our home or to cook with.
[01:26:07.758 --> 01:26:13.862]  But at the same time, the solutions they have, which is wind and solar, aren't sufficient, may never be sufficient.
[01:26:13.862 --> 01:26:14.923]  And so they're not working.
[01:26:14.923 --> 01:26:21.889]  So now there's this push and they're going to do everything to shame us into it being our fault.
[01:26:21.889 --> 01:26:23.210]  And I think it's working.
[01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:25.471]  And you see people are just zombifying.
[01:26:25.471 --> 01:26:26.652]  They're starting to shut down.
[01:26:26.652 --> 01:26:28.954]  Okay, whatever you say, we'll just do it.
[01:26:28.954 --> 01:26:30.996]  We'll go along with it.
[01:26:30.996 --> 01:26:36.160]  And that's when you introduce your carbon footprint.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:39.162]  And this is where it's going to get interesting.
[01:26:39.162 --> 01:26:40.683]  Just listen to what they're saying.
[01:26:40.683 --> 01:26:46.587]  Meat is bad because of methane that is emitted from cow farts and burps.
[01:26:46.587 --> 01:26:54.613]  So if you're eating meat, they're going to calculate your portion of the fart, your portion of the burp, and how much greenhouse gas that is.
[01:26:54.613 --> 01:27:02.078]  And that's going to be marked up somewhere on your chart, which will be directly calculable against what you can or can't do without your money.
[01:27:02.078 --> 01:27:04.320]  And it doesn't, I mean, it sounds futuristic.
[01:27:04.904 --> 01:27:11.907]  But China, of course, already does this to a certain degree with WeChat, and that's what the kind of platform is there.
[01:27:11.907 --> 01:27:24.932]  And, you know, I when I when I think about the government being stupid and being backwards and the true meaning of the term retarded, they actually are backwards.
[01:27:24.932 --> 01:27:25.752]  It's not really true.
[01:27:25.752 --> 01:27:32.195]  I think that you look at DARPA and these guys, you know, they were they were testing the effects of social networking in the 70s.
[01:27:33.195 --> 01:27:39.719]  So when it comes to a central bank digital currency, I have a feeling they have a lot more knowledge and have been working on this for a long time.
[01:27:39.719 --> 01:27:51.887]  And there's been, you know, tons of rumors about different types of financial systems, different altcoins that were supposed to, you know, like XRP or Ripple that was supposed to be this backbone.
[01:27:51.887 --> 01:27:57.271]  All of that seems unlikely, but it seems very likely they do have a plan and they've probably had that for a long time.
[01:27:57.271 --> 01:28:00.013]  The question is, what events will we need
[01:28:00.673 --> 01:28:03.194]  It's really just stunning to be at this moment.
[01:28:03.194 --> 01:28:04.494]  Adam Curry is our guest here.
[01:28:04.494 --> 01:28:06.575]  I'm just sitting back thinking about this.
[01:28:06.575 --> 01:28:08.556]  Let's just talk about food for a moment.
[01:28:08.556 --> 01:28:08.776]  You have
[01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:57.293]  A massive global inflation, after all the stimulus, not just by the U.S., but dozens of other major nations that did it, hundreds of smaller countries, you have people paid for several years in the third world, that is the governments were paid IMF and World Bank money, to just shut down their economies that's now caused mass starvation and collapsed the third world, now flooding via the UN refugee centers into Europe and into the U.S.
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:01.604]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[01:29:01.604 --> 01:29:07.854]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[01:29:07.854 --> 01:29:11.920]  And when we talk about the products at InfoWareStore.com, they all blow you away.
[01:29:12.568 --> 01:29:16.890]  You'll just take them, you'll just try them, I know you'll be with me customers.
[01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:21.112]  And finally, one of our best selling products, sold out for months, it's back in stock, it's X3.
[01:29:21.112 --> 01:29:31.756]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[01:29:31.756 --> 01:29:36.358]  So X3, despite the fact it was run on iodine, is still on sale.
[01:29:36.898 --> 01:29:38.099]  It's our best seller.
[01:30:00.882 --> 01:30:04.645]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[01:30:04.645 --> 01:30:13.712]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[01:30:13.712 --> 01:30:16.335]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[01:30:16.335 --> 01:30:22.980]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:23.981]  It has all the minerals.
[01:30:24.521 --> 01:30:30.083]  All the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[01:30:30.083 --> 01:30:32.685]  Essential means without these things you die.

[01:30:59.057 --> 01:31:01.438]  Fluoride is the enemy.

[01:31:06.881 --> 01:31:08.542]  What's the good halogen?
[01:31:08.542 --> 01:31:11.363]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[01:31:49.846 --> 01:31:55.071]  But when you fight tyranny, the New World Order comes after you.
[01:31:55.071 --> 01:31:57.753]  Now, I knew that.
[01:32:06.997 --> 01:32:11.220]  And for 28 years I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.

[01:32:59.338 --> 01:33:05.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.836 --> 01:33:17.767]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:17.767 --> 01:33:22.016]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.016 --> 01:33:23.159]  The Canada North America.
[01:33:24.188 --> 01:33:31.935]  And then you have in the Netherlands and many other places like Australia ordering people to get rid of a certain amount of their sheep and cows.
[01:33:31.935 --> 01:33:34.257]  By 2030, they want it to be 90% of them.
[01:33:34.257 --> 01:33:37.159]  That's why the farmers are obviously protesting.
[01:33:37.159 --> 01:33:39.661]  You have the fertilizer prices exploding.
[01:33:39.661 --> 01:33:46.727]  And you look at these numbers, the UN World Food Chief just said last week, this is going to be hell on earth.
[01:33:46.727 --> 01:33:49.369]  Hundreds of millions can starve to death, probably will.
[01:33:49.369 --> 01:33:51.071]  We already know in the last few years of lockdown,
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:55.121]  That tens of millions extra starve to death.
[01:33:55.121 --> 01:34:01.304]  They are deliberately cutting off the industrial base of the planet.
[01:34:01.304 --> 01:34:03.325]  Yes, and they have a plan for this.
[01:34:03.325 --> 01:34:11.329]  A couple years ago, I met a guy called Texas Slim, who was starting something called the Beef Initiative, beefinitiative.com.
[01:34:11.329 --> 01:34:13.210]  And it was really interesting.
[01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:17.632]  He says, Adam, you know, you have to understand, we need some real food intelligence.
[01:34:17.632 --> 01:34:18.732]  I'm like, food intelligence?
[01:34:18.732 --> 01:34:19.553]  What are you talking about?
[01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:21.654]  So as he kind of lifted the veil for me,
[01:34:22.794 --> 01:34:43.483]  In 2018, the final consolidation of Big Ag and pharmaceuticals, you know, we had Bayer and Monsanto and all these big mega-mergers, that was kind of when everyone decided, when those guys decided, you know, here we go, we're moving towards new food and this, of course, has not gone unnoticed.
[01:34:43.483 --> 01:34:51.506]  The idea is, since meat is bad for you and bad for the environment, and the PSYOP is also that it's been bad for you, this has been
[01:34:52.128 --> 01:34:56.851]  Something that's been jammed into people's heads for many, many decades.
[01:34:56.851 --> 01:35:08.179]  You are going to eat meat alternatives, and you need your protein, so it'll be soy, plant-based products, as well as insects for protein, and that's already kind of slipping in.
[01:35:08.179 --> 01:35:16.405]  And in a way, you know, you get Nicole Kidman eating some bugs on camera, part of the obvious promotion, but really they've already slipped it in.
[01:35:16.405 --> 01:35:21.188]  It has different names, cricket powder is in all kinds of flour products already.
[01:35:22.089 --> 01:35:34.819]  But what is interesting is, particularly in the United States, the food industry, when it comes to animal protein, it's a cartel of four major food processors.
[01:35:34.819 --> 01:35:38.742]  So it's JBS, it's Cargill, it's two others.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:47.602]  And ranchers and farmers, but let's talk about ranchers for a second, have been really removed from the consumer.
[01:35:47.602 --> 01:35:59.765]  So it's almost like commodity cowboys where, you know, we raise our cattle and then whenever the processing plant says we can take them, whether they're ready or not, whether they, you know, could grow more, they go.
[01:35:59.765 --> 01:36:02.946]  You know, it's completely out of the ranchers' hands at this point.
[01:36:03.646 --> 01:36:03.987]  I think so.
[01:36:20.081 --> 01:36:20.962]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:39.183 --> 01:36:43.806]  10 different touch points of the cattle before they're finally up here and taken to slaughter.
[01:36:43.806 --> 01:36:47.128]  That was a famous joke with McDonald's even in the 80s.
[01:36:47.128 --> 01:36:49.330]  It was a big investigation.
[01:36:49.330 --> 01:36:55.834]  The burgers would say all American beef on the wrapper, while all American, Brazilian, and Argentinian beef.
[01:36:55.834 --> 01:36:56.994]  Correct, correct.
[01:36:56.994 --> 01:36:59.576]  And just because it says USDA, I mean it's all lies.
[01:36:59.576 --> 01:37:02.698]  All the packaging, it's all meant to obfuscate the truth.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:08.781]  So the bottom line is, as Americans, we're not eating food.
[01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:10.762]  We really are not eating food.
[01:37:10.762 --> 01:37:14.623]  And we don't know it because it all looks good and it tastes good.
[01:37:14.623 --> 01:37:17.644]  You know, you used to hear, oh, processed foods, that's bad for you.
[01:37:17.644 --> 01:37:19.544]  Yeah, it's not even food.
[01:37:19.544 --> 01:37:21.705]  I didn't really realize it myself, to be honest.
[01:37:22.465 --> 01:37:35.908]  But then when you start consuming real beef, you can get it directly from a rancher, which is what the Beef Initiative is trying to do, to connect consumers to ranchers again and create this parallel economy.
[01:37:35.908 --> 01:37:44.370]  That's the only way out because the plan, and also it's not hidden, the plan is less actual animal protein, more synthetics.
[01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:46.512]  And let me just back you up on this.
[01:37:46.512 --> 01:37:55.219]  Just a few weeks ago, there were a bunch of articles from the WEF, from Bill Gates, saying to fight climate change, we need ultra-processed food.
[01:37:55.219 --> 01:38:03.567]  And then the FDA came out a few months ago and said, we're not going to even regulate nanotech in food.
[01:38:03.567 --> 01:38:05.849]  That was a finding where we just don't have a jurisdiction.
[01:38:06.249 --> 01:38:08.653]  So this is really a transhumanist revolution.
[01:38:08.653 --> 01:38:15.022]  You got Gates, the biggest private farm owner in the United States, talking about his magic GMO seeds.
[01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:18.608]  I mean, this really is a corporate takeover of the entire infrastructure.
[01:38:18.608 --> 01:38:22.053]  Can you elaborate on your in-depth research and perspective on that, Adam Curry?
[01:38:24.002 --> 01:38:26.643]  Yeah, I would say here's an interesting one.
[01:38:26.643 --> 01:38:28.604]  You know, you mentioned the Netherlands and the farmers.
[01:38:28.604 --> 01:38:29.864]  Well, I grew up in the Netherlands.
[01:38:29.864 --> 01:38:43.528]  I moved there from the States when I was seven and actually went through the Dutch schooling system and I've been there for quite a while and know a lot about it and also know a lot of the farmers and everything you've heard is absolutely true.
[01:38:43.528 --> 01:38:49.290]  You know, the whole idea of this net zero is to create this huge
[01:38:49.730 --> 01:38:50.410]  We're good to go.
[01:39:12.826 --> 01:39:26.293]  But what was surprising, since they are, you know, very famous and very big in their animal and other farm exports, is that this company that I grew up with called Royal DSM.
[01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:34.578]  Royal DSM was a royal, because of the Dutch royal family's investment, like Royal Dutch Shell, DSM was a chemical company.
[01:39:34.578 --> 01:39:40.881]  It was just, it was a chemical, yeah, big chemical processing company.
[01:39:41.756 --> 01:39:51.180]  And I woke up one day and I looked around and I'm reading about, you know, food and processing stuff and I see DSM acquired some company, go take a look.
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:53.060]  These guys have completely transformed.
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:40:04.345]  Now with 8 billion euros in revenue every year, they are the largest supplier to the world of processed food, i.e.
[01:40:04.345 --> 01:40:09.987]  bugs, soy and plants, of taste and texture products.
[01:40:10.931 --> 01:40:12.273]  And that's it.
[01:40:12.273 --> 01:40:16.737]  That's the key there, is it tastes good.
[01:40:16.737 --> 01:40:17.819]  It tastes right.
[01:40:17.819 --> 01:40:18.800]  It feels right.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.400]  We don't care.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.385]  As Americans, we really are not good at recognizing food.
[01:40:23.385 --> 01:40:28.210]  And it's hard, because they're really making this stuff look and taste the way it should.
[01:40:28.210 --> 01:40:30.632]  And even the way, what's not even natural.
[01:40:30.632 --> 01:40:32.895]  They do lots of tests to make sure that you're going to like it.
[01:40:33.456 --> 01:40:44.163]  And this is what's made us sick, and I look at the statistics, 47% of all children in America are at least pre-diabetic.
[01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:47.205]  I mean, that's... They're killing us!
[01:40:47.205 --> 01:40:49.626]  That's a genocide, absolutely.
[01:40:49.626 --> 01:40:57.391]  And part of this stems from, and the same people around from climate change, it all goes back to the population bomb.
[01:40:58.001 --> 01:41:00.523]  And Dvorak and I talk about this all the time on the show.
[01:41:00.523 --> 01:41:10.949]  You know, in the 70s there was a book that came out and everyone was freaking out, and this is likely the genesis of the Georgia Guidestones, is we need, you know, we need less people on the planet.
[01:41:10.949 --> 01:41:11.830]  How are we going to do that?
[01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:16.333]  I mean, the eugenics movement in the United States, which is rarely discussed,
[01:41:16.813 --> 01:41:20.836]  But man, you know, Hitler was writing fan letters to the people who were involved in that.
[01:41:20.836 --> 01:41:31.684]  It's very embarrassing and very little known about how... I mean, we had beautiful baby contests at state fairs, you know, to show, hey, look, this is my perfect baby.
[01:41:31.684 --> 01:41:39.069]  And, you know, after, you know, you look at some of these less perfect human beings, we've got to get rid of them.
[01:41:39.069 --> 01:41:43.232]  Well, to be clear, Hitler got eugenics from the UK and the United States.
[01:41:43.232 --> 01:41:45.374]  So, Adam, big picture here.
[01:41:47.276 --> 01:41:50.259]  The globalists want to scientifically control all of human aspects.
[01:41:50.259 --> 01:41:53.802]  They said they're building a transhumanist post-human world.
[01:41:53.802 --> 01:41:55.684]  How do all these factors come together?
[01:41:55.684 --> 01:41:59.067]  And where do you think, from their own admissions, they're trying to take us?
[01:41:59.067 --> 01:42:02.350]  And how is their operation to get us there going?
[01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:11.538]  If this was a football game, pro-freedom folks versus the technocracy, team freedom versus team demon, how's humanity doing right now?
[01:42:14.627 --> 01:42:15.648]  How's humanity?
[01:42:15.648 --> 01:42:18.569]  Well, humanity is not licked by a long shot.
[01:42:18.569 --> 01:42:23.731]  They wouldn't have to put so much into propagandizing us if they had it all figured out.
[01:42:23.731 --> 01:42:26.052]  In fact, it's really not a football game.
[01:42:26.052 --> 01:42:27.632]  I don't think there's any finesse to it.
[01:42:27.632 --> 01:42:31.314]  They're going with sledgehammers, and the sledgehammers are money and food.
[01:42:31.314 --> 01:42:31.774]  That's all.
[01:42:31.774 --> 01:42:32.654]  I agree.
[01:42:32.654 --> 01:42:39.177]  It is just brute force controlling the infrastructure attack, and the solution is, we already see it happening,
[01:42:39.924 --> 01:42:44.167]  A hundred years ago, 90% of people were rural, 10% were urban.
[01:42:44.167 --> 01:42:51.333]  Today, 90% are urban, 10% are rural, but we're seeing a mass exodus back to the country and people rediscovering local communities.
[01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:55.296]  The UN talks about sustainability, but what they're pushing is the opposite.
[01:42:55.296 --> 01:42:57.638]  We need real sustainability, and that means local community.
[01:42:58.584 --> 01:43:00.145]  Look around you.
[01:43:00.145 --> 01:43:05.147]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[01:43:05.147 --> 01:43:06.908]  Infowars credibility.
[01:43:06.908 --> 01:43:09.049]  My credibility has never been higher.
[01:43:09.049 --> 01:43:18.374]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[01:43:18.374 --> 01:43:24.037]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[01:43:24.037 --> 01:43:27.639]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[01:43:28.479 --> 01:43:31.603]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[01:43:31.603 --> 01:43:37.892]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[01:43:37.892 --> 01:43:39.174]  It's unsustainable.
[01:43:39.174 --> 01:43:40.395]  So please, visit.
[01:43:41.485 --> 01:43:43.467]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:43:43.467 --> 01:43:51.576]  SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[01:43:51.576 --> 01:43:54.580]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:55.881]  Thank you for your support.
[01:43:55.881 --> 01:43:56.982]  Wouldn't be here without you.
[01:43:56.982 --> 01:43:58.064]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:43:59.807 --> 01:44:04.691]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:44:04.691 --> 01:44:11.116]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:44:11.116 --> 01:44:16.240]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.942]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:44:17.942 --> 01:44:24.367]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[01:44:25.087 --> 01:44:30.512]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[01:44:30.512 --> 01:44:34.835]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:44:34.835 --> 01:44:44.003]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:44:44.003 --> 01:44:45.424]  God bless you all.
[01:44:45.424 --> 01:44:46.465]  I salute you.
[01:44:46.465 --> 01:44:47.546]  I thank you.
[01:44:47.546 --> 01:44:52.931]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:44:53.551 --> 01:44:54.911]  The fight is my fight.
[01:44:54.911 --> 01:44:55.532]  It's your fight.
[01:44:55.532 --> 01:44:56.272]  It's our fight.
[01:44:56.272 --> 01:44:58.353]  God bless you all.
[01:44:58.353 --> 01:45:01.834]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[01:45:01.834 --> 01:45:04.975]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[01:45:04.975 --> 01:45:06.595]  Now, I knew that.
[01:45:06.595 --> 01:45:09.416]  And for 28 years, I've been on air exposing these people.
[01:45:09.416 --> 01:45:11.236]  And together, we've had a great effect.
[01:45:11.236 --> 01:45:13.257]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[01:45:13.257 --> 01:45:14.477]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:45:14.477 --> 01:45:16.538]  But they can't beat the power of we the people.
[01:45:16.798 --> 01:45:17.458]  We're good to go.
[01:45:41.803 --> 01:45:43.543]  Look, it's not hype that InfoWars has changed the world.
[01:46:01.363 --> 01:46:05.888]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars is the reason we were able to do this.
[01:46:05.888 --> 01:46:07.590]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:11.494]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[01:46:11.494 --> 01:46:15.398]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[01:46:15.398 --> 01:46:18.161]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells.
[01:46:18.161 --> 01:46:19.102]  It does just give you more energy.
[01:46:19.102 --> 01:46:20.243]  It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[01:46:20.723 --> 01:46:26.944]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[01:46:26.944 --> 01:46:31.325]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.
[01:46:31.325 --> 01:46:35.386]  Take a few drops every day and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[01:46:35.386 --> 01:46:36.866]  Plus it funds the InfoWar.
[01:46:36.866 --> 01:46:40.666]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:05.088]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.821 --> 01:47:20.063]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:23.507 --> 01:47:28.629]  That's the only way to go and you know all of our problems stem from this.
[01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:37.152]  It's like our education system and I'll take some blame for that because in the 80s and 90s when we were coming up and I'm now 58.
[01:47:37.152 --> 01:47:41.334]  You know, party time, making a career, having a good time.
[01:47:41.334 --> 01:47:43.955]  I was in New York, it was fantastic.
[01:47:44.575 --> 01:47:51.343]  Uh, school board, you know, clearly some loser who couldn't get a better gig there on the school board.
[01:47:51.343 --> 01:47:54.968]  You know, local city council, yeah, whatever.
[01:47:54.968 --> 01:47:57.050]  So we weren't paying attention.
[01:47:57.050 --> 01:47:59.593]  And that's where a lot of problems crept in.
[01:47:59.593 --> 01:48:01.095]  So that has to be dealt with locally.
[01:48:01.095 --> 01:48:01.836]  But before that...
[01:48:02.556 --> 01:48:18.488]  And I know it sounds like doomsday, but it's important that you find a rancher or whether it's beef or hog or chickens and farmers, although I think you can probably get away with just animal protein if it really gets bad.
[01:48:18.488 --> 01:48:22.691]  You need to go shake their hand, go find out how they operate.
[01:48:22.691 --> 01:48:24.452]  Will they sell directly to you?
[01:48:24.452 --> 01:48:25.913]  These are things you just need
[01:48:25.913 --> 01:48:26.553]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:48.946 --> 01:48:51.006]  They don't have Monsanto grass.
[01:48:51.006 --> 01:49:00.548]  And not only that, but here in Texas, they're starting to go back to their old processes that they learned from their grandparents.
[01:49:00.548 --> 01:49:15.211]  And by the way, for the folks that don't know, every ancient culture, whether it was the Hindus 3,000 plus years ago, or the Jews 3,000 plus years ago, when you read the Vedic text for the Old Testament, it's God then made the grass for the cows to eat, and that gave us the wealth.
[01:49:15.211 --> 01:49:16.031]  And then Moses says,
[01:49:16.691 --> 01:49:29.295]  You know, in Exodus, stop worshipping the golden calf because that's what they were worshipping, but people know beef and the protein in it, what it does when it's not been burned, makes us stronger, makes our hearts better, our brains better.
[01:49:29.295 --> 01:49:39.999]  Humans have basically developed into what we are with bigger heads, larger brains, healthier, longer-lived, because we went from being mainly a herbivore to a non-divore to a carnivore.
[01:49:40.219 --> 01:49:42.802]  And that's in all the real science studies, they know it.
[01:49:42.802 --> 01:49:51.513]  And you take away red meat, clean, healthy red meat from people, you literally emasculate them, you dumb them down, lower IQs in children, everything.
[01:49:51.513 --> 01:49:59.022]  We are a transitional species going carnivorous, and they're trying to take us out of that because it has immediate effects from just mainline research.
[01:49:59.022 --> 01:49:59.783]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:50:01.155 --> 01:50:10.568]  Well, I agree with that, and I think it was Jordan Peterson who said that once we discovered fire and we were cooking our meat, our bellies shrank and our heads grew.
[01:50:10.568 --> 01:50:13.792]  And by the way, there's
[01:50:15.482 --> 01:50:18.225]  I've been looking for this study and I haven't found it.
[01:50:18.225 --> 01:50:23.149]  It seems to have disappeared, but at the time when I saw it, it looked like it was pretty legit.
[01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:26.472]  A study in Japan about something called soy rage.
[01:50:26.472 --> 01:50:34.079]  You know, if you're not feeding good healthy protein to your children's brains, you know, weird stuff can start to happen.
[01:50:34.079 --> 01:50:38.503]  And now we have to get into the medication of our children.
[01:50:39.664 --> 01:50:49.312]  It's so flabbergasting how quickly this went from some Ritalin 20 years ago to now Adderall, Vyvanse.
[01:50:49.312 --> 01:50:58.300]  These are just standard things that kids trade in the schoolyard.
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:03.604]  The percentage of children on anti-anxiety medication is astounding.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:09.962]  I'm not quite sure what we do with the current generation.
[01:51:09.962 --> 01:51:10.263]  Absolutely.
[01:51:10.263 --> 01:51:11.443]  Let me just pause you there.
[01:51:11.443 --> 01:51:13.825]  Let me just interrupt the famous Alex Jones interruption.
[01:51:13.825 --> 01:51:15.326]  Adam Curry kicking ass here with us today.
[01:51:15.326 --> 01:51:17.627]  Really appreciate him joining us on this Saturday morning.
[01:51:17.627 --> 01:51:21.750]  We're going to air this later in the day and then later this week we're going to air it on the main show.
[01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:22.831]  Let's get into the medications.
[01:51:22.831 --> 01:51:27.374]  But when you mentioned the soy study, there's actually one out of Italy.
[01:51:27.374 --> 01:51:28.654]  There's one out of Canada.
[01:51:28.654 --> 01:51:31.576]  There's a big one out of Japan you just mentioned.
[01:51:31.576 --> 01:51:32.477]  We actually just found it.
[01:51:32.477 --> 01:51:33.157]  We'll put it on screen.
[01:51:35.070 --> 01:51:51.115]  It turned out that the burgers, the veggie burgers that Gates was putting out in stores, people were rejecting them, and also the one that Burger King was going to put out, literally had more soy in one patty than what someone gendered transitioning would take of estrogen.
[01:51:51.115 --> 01:51:52.695]  And so I saw those articles, I mean,
[01:51:53.707 --> 01:51:55.408]  I ate one of them just to see what it would do.
[01:51:55.408 --> 01:51:58.290]  I literally got sick and threw up three hours later.
[01:51:58.290 --> 01:52:06.354]  So we already know the food's weaponized, but this bombing men with soy feminizes men, the studies show, and hyperfeminizes girls.
[01:52:06.354 --> 01:52:07.955]  That's why what girls used to go into puberty at 12.
[01:52:09.139 --> 01:52:10.360]  Now the average is nine.
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:16.383]  They have three-year-olds going into puberty and it's directly tied to the plastics, the bisphenol A, but also the soy.
[01:52:16.383 --> 01:52:22.967]  So let's just back up what you said and put the study back on screen that you're absolutely right, Adam Curry, about soy rage.
[01:52:22.967 --> 01:52:31.732]  And you see these men that are on it and how they look crazy and just act so bizarre because literally they are mainlining estrogen, plant-based estrogen.
[01:52:31.732 --> 01:52:33.693]  There it is.
[01:52:33.693 --> 01:52:34.594]  I'm glad you found that.
[01:52:34.594 --> 01:52:36.194]  Some PubMed, I'm glad you found that.
[01:52:39.716 --> 01:52:47.925]  You know, there's a lot at play here, you know, take into account that according to the mainstream and according to
[01:52:50.192 --> 01:53:02.776]  The political left, you know, the most horrible, dangerous, hated people in the United States certainly are white cis, cis, there you go, so white straight men.
[01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:09.778]  This is, you can't just add, men are complicated and simple at the same time.
[01:53:09.778 --> 01:53:13.719]  But men have some very specific needs that are not being met.
[01:53:13.719 --> 01:53:16.600]  In fact, men are checking out, young men are checking out
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:21.263]  Just, in general, in amazing numbers.
[01:53:21.263 --> 01:53:35.794]  Now, with all of this, Alex, I have to say, there's so much hope and so much goodness because we don't have to fall into, we don't have to follow their systems, we don't have to use their systems, we don't have to buy their fake food.
[01:53:35.794 --> 01:53:40.017]  And we're going to talk about solutions, I totally agree, but we have to identify the problem.
[01:53:40.017 --> 01:53:42.819]  And you're a really smart guy, so we've got time here, commercial free.
[01:53:43.399 --> 01:53:43.959]  We're good to go.
[01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:04.271]  And women, you're in charge.
[01:54:04.271 --> 01:54:14.516]  But really, if you read Yuval Noah Harari and the rest of them, they say, actually, the post-human era is in 2047, and humans are obsolete, and humans are not in the future.
[01:54:14.516 --> 01:54:15.517]  The future is not human.
[01:54:15.517 --> 01:54:23.101]  And I think a lot of women, we see the numbers, are actually waking up to that now and realizing that Gloria Steinem was CIA, culture engineering.
[01:54:23.101 --> 01:54:24.662]  None of this was in power women.
[01:54:24.662 --> 01:54:26.403]  So spend some time on that.
[01:54:26.403 --> 01:54:28.804]  Talk about the problem with men and what men need.
[01:54:32.333 --> 01:54:43.439]  Well, I mean, I don't know if I'm qualified to say that, but I am qualified to see the observations.
[01:54:43.439 --> 01:54:51.224]  Let me tell you about the men that I'm working with, and the young men, I'm talking millennials, so around 30, could be a little younger, could be a little older.
[01:54:51.224 --> 01:54:55.786]  They were born around 1990, which was a very complicated time.
[01:54:57.587 --> 01:55:01.091]  Actually, it was a complicated media time because we had the first Gulf War.
[01:55:01.091 --> 01:55:11.721]  CNN was, at that point, hilarious if we go back and take a look at some of the green screen and fakery and stuff, although what was happening there was real.
[01:55:11.721 --> 01:55:17.526]  And I remember sitting with my daughter, you know, in her little rocker there, just watching this day in, day out.
[01:55:17.526 --> 01:55:20.269]  It was quite a television experience.
[01:55:21.159 --> 01:55:22.281]  So they grew up with that.
[01:55:22.281 --> 01:55:26.926]  Then around, you know, middle school, we have 9-11 now.
[01:55:26.926 --> 01:55:28.128]  That's traumatic.
[01:55:28.128 --> 01:55:29.830]  It was traumatic for the world.
[01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:36.978]  And you can only imagine how that sets certain brains into motion and how they or how they look at things.
[01:55:36.978 --> 01:55:39.061]  It's very, you know, very young, very impressionable.
[01:55:40.079 --> 01:55:59.291]  Then, you know, then we went into, we invaded the wrong country, you know, there was anthrax, yellow cake, aluminum tubes, weapons of mass destruction, lots of imagery, imagery, imagery that just was so destructive and damaging, I think, to that generation.
[01:55:59.291 --> 01:56:08.176]  But it's okay, we're gonna find him, it'll all be fine, you know, and then that moves on a little bit, and then we get to the financial crisis.
[01:56:09.008 --> 01:56:24.398]  Meanwhile, this generation is now in school, in college, many of them, and they've taken out loans to get the education they say is their guaranteed ticket, which has been another marketing exercise to say, yeah, don't, just get this degree and you'll be good to go.
[01:56:24.398 --> 01:56:25.019]  They came out.
[01:56:27.038 --> 01:56:41.845]  Just as the financial collapse, the last time we went through this, which is kind of the reason why we're here today with the financial system, and everything fell apart and they saw families having to move.
[01:56:41.845 --> 01:56:44.126]  That was quite a disastrous couple of years, 2008-2009.
[01:56:46.645 --> 01:56:52.991]  And there they were with their college degrees, and it's like, well, you know, this is what you got, $12 an hour.
[01:56:52.991 --> 01:56:54.813]  Congratulations.
[01:56:54.813 --> 01:56:58.437]  Or you can maybe drive an Uber or, you know, the gig economy.
[01:56:58.437 --> 01:57:02.721]  And then, you know, the social contract was kind of broken.
[01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:05.531]  That's not what was supposed to happen.
[01:57:05.531 --> 01:57:09.652]  Now throw some COVID and lockdown at them, and now you see the result.
[01:57:09.652 --> 01:57:13.473]  The demoralization is incredible across the board.
[01:57:13.473 --> 01:57:27.158]  We have quiet quitting, we have all these different things that people are doing, and I think in a way also positive because people are reevaluating their lives, and this is a real positive.
[01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:35.824]  Um, where if you worked at any company, any company that had slack inside its organization, you were not working 9 to 5.
[01:57:35.824 --> 01:57:48.913]  You were working 24-7 because that had become the culture of our corporate economy.
[01:57:48.913 --> 01:57:49.634]  It's our best seller.
[01:57:50.728 --> 01:57:51.148]  We're good to go.
[01:58:10.137 --> 01:58:12.818]  But it helps every cellular function of the body.
[01:58:12.818 --> 01:58:19.942]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[01:58:19.942 --> 01:58:22.543]  Essential means without these things you die.
[01:58:22.543 --> 01:58:30.647]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this.
[01:58:30.647 --> 01:58:32.868]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[01:58:33.348 --> 01:58:37.552]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWars.
[01:58:37.552 --> 01:58:44.498]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting Vitamin Mineral Fusion finally back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com for 50% off.

[01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:09.260]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and free speech on the air, and I thank you.
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:14.182]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[01:59:14.182 --> 01:59:15.443]  And I need your support.
[01:59:15.443 --> 01:59:22.846]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com

[01:59:31.912 --> 01:59:36.455]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[01:59:36.455 --> 01:59:40.678]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[01:59:40.678 --> 01:59:48.084]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and justice in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[01:59:50.106 --> 01:59:54.729]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:54.729 --> 02:00:01.594]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:06.638]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:00:06.638 --> 02:00:08.099]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:12.763]  I need to hop on a Zoom call, do anything.
[02:00:12.763 --> 02:00:19.128]  And I believe that people are re-evaluating their lives and saying, no, no, no, that's just not worth it to me.
[02:00:19.128 --> 02:00:26.235]  And seeing as they came from $12 an hour, they're probably willing to give up a little now that we're at $20 an hour.
[02:00:26.235 --> 02:00:29.378]  So this is a pullback in enthusiasm.
[02:00:29.378 --> 02:00:30.619]  Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
[02:00:30.619 --> 02:00:34.022]  And we're all going to die by 2030 thanks to climate change.
[02:00:34.022 --> 02:00:34.743]  What do you expect?
[02:00:36.485 --> 02:00:36.945]  Exactly.
[02:00:36.945 --> 02:00:48.650]  They're trying to get humanity to give up and roll over, but then BlackRock and Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in the last year have sent threat emails out that are public to their employees saying, if you don't start working four days a week in the office, you're fired.
[02:00:48.650 --> 02:01:00.395]  So they told everybody else to quit, to get Main Street to quit, to get the small farmers to quit so they can consolidate and vertically integrate the economy, but now even their own minions are quitting, and the robot revolution hasn't shown up on time to replace us yet.
[02:01:02.758 --> 02:01:10.186]  Well, I don't know when the robot revolution will come in, but you're absolutely right.
[02:01:10.186 --> 02:01:19.837]  And there's no reporting, there's no real analysis of some of these systems that have been broken because of this and also mandatory vaccinations.
[02:01:20.497 --> 02:01:24.978]  The most important one for the United States is our aviation system.
[02:01:24.978 --> 02:01:26.339]  The system is broken.
[02:01:26.339 --> 02:01:35.501]  It is completely broken because pilots and aircrew, other aircrew and ground crew, the system, but pilots, you really need pilots to fly.
[02:01:35.501 --> 02:01:43.744]  Many of them would not accept the vaccine into their life and so they either retired early or they quit, went to do... I know pilots who are ranchers now.
[02:01:45.747 --> 02:01:53.543]  And then there was a large contingent who literally can no longer be certified to fly because they have side effects.
[02:01:54.632 --> 02:01:57.453]  Such as myocarditis and other heart issues.
[02:01:57.453 --> 02:02:09.819]  And it's not that simple to train a pilot to be a commercial airline aviator.
[02:02:09.819 --> 02:02:12.040]  And the same thing holds true there.
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:21.124]  If you studied and you got your pilots, I'm a pilot, I fly helicopters and fixed wing, just my own, not commercially obviously.
[02:02:21.124 --> 02:02:21.884]  If you want to
[02:02:22.907 --> 02:02:23.127]  I don't
[02:02:40.111 --> 02:02:50.340]  And now we've seen all these headlines of, we're going to fire our white pilots and hire minority pilots, when we're talking about 3, 4, 5, 10 year learning curve, just the time you invest is insane.
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:57.146]  I don't want to interrupt you, but I don't want to get accused of trying to cover up for Big Pharma and Prozac and the mass murder pills.
[02:02:57.146 --> 02:03:07.175]  Let's go back to that segue where I interrupted you to get back into food, and let's hit the drugs and your view on that, and then move into politics, the world, where you see this going, and solutions.
[02:03:08.693 --> 02:03:23.042]  Well, the media is our problem, which is why I so enjoy what you do, and podcasting in general, which is why we started Podcasting 2.0, to ensure that your podcast is on Podcasting 2.0.
[02:03:23.042 --> 02:03:27.284]  Any podcast can be there, unless you don't want it there, then it's taken off.
[02:03:27.284 --> 02:03:31.187]  And it's distributed, so they can try and come after
[02:03:31.827 --> 02:03:33.448]  Whatever we're doing, but it's distributed.
[02:03:33.448 --> 02:03:34.868]  There's no way to take it down.
[02:03:34.868 --> 02:03:35.188]  That's right.
[02:03:35.188 --> 02:03:36.169]  Let's just get this in there.
[02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:39.730]  You say you're not an expert, but you are really smart.
[02:03:39.730 --> 02:03:42.091]  I know you know what you're talking about, because all of it is research.
[02:03:42.091 --> 02:03:49.273]  You are an expert in old media, new media, and have been in the vanguard of media for, what is it, 40 years.
[02:03:49.273 --> 02:03:51.674]  So speak to that, Adam.
[02:03:51.674 --> 02:03:55.235]  You don't look that old, but you've been around a while.
[02:03:55.235 --> 02:03:56.795]  So you're an OG in this.
[02:03:56.795 --> 02:03:58.136]  You pioneered podcasting.
[02:03:59.063 --> 02:04:04.390]  Where do you see the censorship wars, the dying corporate media trying to use censorship to cut down their competition?
[02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:07.854]  But the more they do that, it just gives room for even more people to come forward.
[02:04:07.854 --> 02:04:17.567]  What's going to happen in this big struggle between dinosaur media allied with big tech against the public's just craving for real independent ideas?
[02:04:20.289 --> 02:04:25.391]  Well, the problem is the business model.
[02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:30.713]  If you have any corporate money involved in media, it's a problem.
[02:04:30.713 --> 02:04:37.415]  So advertising is a problem because advertising is always censorship.
[02:04:37.415 --> 02:04:44.518]  At the very minimum, you can't talk about a competing product while you have a product or service who is sponsoring your program.
[02:04:46.159 --> 02:04:52.904]  Having been in this business for a long time with commercial television and radio, the advertiser rules.
[02:04:52.904 --> 02:05:00.790]  The advertiser, if they don't want a... I don't promote things unless they really work.
[02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:07.695]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge, tip of the spear.
[02:05:07.695 --> 02:05:10.958]  And when we talk about the products in InfoWareStore.com, they all blow you away.
[02:05:11.894 --> 02:05:13.916]  Just take them, and you'll just try them.
[02:05:13.916 --> 02:05:16.078]  I know you'll be your big customers.
[02:05:16.078 --> 02:05:19.301]  And finally, one of our best-selling products, sold out for months, it's back in stock.
[02:05:19.301 --> 02:05:20.282]  It's X3.
[02:05:20.282 --> 02:05:30.952]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[02:05:30.952 --> 02:05:35.536]  So X3, despite the fact it was run on iodine, is still on sale
[02:05:35.776 --> 02:05:36.096]  I think so.
[02:06:08.849 --> 02:06:14.655]  And we're already into hour number three on this Friday, October 14th worldwide transmission.
[02:06:14.655 --> 02:06:24.424]  We're going to finish up with some of the key excerpts of the Adam Curry historic interview, the full hour and a half plus interview, and will be posted later today to band.video.
[02:06:24.424 --> 02:06:31.250]  And then coming up in a little while, probably my most important interview out of more than 60 or 70 over the years,
[02:06:32.006 --> 02:06:35.207]  Coming more than that now, maybe a hundred, with the great David Icke.
[02:06:35.207 --> 02:06:37.967]  So that's coming up right into the fourth hour today.
[02:06:37.967 --> 02:06:39.688]  But here we are in the third hour.
[02:06:39.688 --> 02:06:43.529]  I want to thank all the listeners and viewers and just appreciate you for your support.
[02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:44.749]  And I want to clarify this again.
[02:06:44.749 --> 02:06:48.430]  I know most of you know this, but a lot of new listeners are tuning in and they don't know it.
[02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:49.570]  We're not going away.
[02:06:49.570 --> 02:06:51.030]  We're not being shut down.
[02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:52.510]  There's a million dollar verdicts of fraud.
[02:06:52.510 --> 02:06:54.711]  I don't have three million dollars in the company or personally.
[02:06:55.822 --> 02:06:57.283]  They're not allowed to take away our First Amendment.
[02:06:57.283 --> 02:06:58.725]  We're not going to back down.
[02:06:58.725 --> 02:07:04.650]  As long as you support the broadcast, and buy products, and spread the word, at m4tour.com, we're not going anywhere.
[02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:09.233]  We're going to appeal these fraudulent decisions, this kangaroo court, and so much more.
[02:07:09.233 --> 02:07:13.297]  If you want to really know the details of it, Steven Crowder wanted the full data dump.
[02:07:13.297 --> 02:07:15.619]  I did an hour-long interview with him yesterday.
[02:07:16.471 --> 02:07:16.631]  Let's
[02:07:33.366 --> 02:07:35.468]  Again, you can find it at Infowars.com.
[02:07:35.468 --> 02:07:41.034]  So I'm going to get back to the conclusion of the very important Adam Curry interview.
[02:07:41.034 --> 02:07:43.476]  And then, as I said, David Icke is coming up.
[02:07:43.476 --> 02:07:48.441]  I'm so honored and humbled by your support and your outpouring of love.
[02:07:48.441 --> 02:07:50.143]  Look, I knew I was in a fight with the New World Order.
[02:07:50.143 --> 02:07:52.245]  I expected these attacks and far more.
[02:07:52.245 --> 02:07:53.406]  So I'm just blessed to be here.
[02:07:54.082 --> 02:07:55.283]  We're going up against pure evil.
[02:07:55.283 --> 02:07:58.384]  The world is waking up, and it's a beautiful time to be alive.
[02:07:58.384 --> 02:08:12.171]  Just remember how incredibly powerful you are when you resist, when you speak up, when you say no, and when you share information like this broadcast with our incredible guests, callers, special reports, and my analysis, and so much more.
[02:08:12.171 --> 02:08:13.111]  So thank you for your support.
[02:08:13.111 --> 02:08:14.612]  Got a big mega sale.
[02:08:14.612 --> 02:08:16.673]  It's been extended for the weekend, and then it's got to end.
[02:08:16.673 --> 02:08:17.753]  There's a bunch of stuff selling out.
[02:08:17.753 --> 02:08:18.374]  50% off.

[02:08:49.315 --> 02:08:56.757]  So now's the time to support the broadcast and get really life-empowering, amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[02:08:56.757 --> 02:08:59.598]  Back to Adam Curry, the inventor of podcasting.
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:00.840]  We're good to go.
[02:09:21.713 --> 02:09:31.219]  Well, you look into the numbers, the reason why is because we have an election year, so they know that a billion dollars or more is going to be spent on the midterm elections, and pharma.
[02:09:31.219 --> 02:09:43.768]  So Pfizer, we've all seen the super cuts, you know, they in essence own the media, which is why there's no real pushback against anything when it comes to pharmaceuticals.
[02:09:43.768 --> 02:09:46.610]  There you go, that's a perfect chart of how it all fits together.
[02:09:48.968 --> 02:09:57.414]  Now, what Dvorak and I discovered 15 years ago when we started the No Agenda podcast is it is very possible, and you know this too,
[02:09:58.657 --> 02:10:00.319]  To make a living.
[02:10:00.319 --> 02:10:01.940]  Now, we only do an audio podcast.
[02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:03.261]  We don't have video.
[02:10:03.261 --> 02:10:05.163]  We literally do everything ourselves.
[02:10:05.163 --> 02:10:11.308]  Our family members help out with some back office stuff, and we keep it very lean.
[02:10:11.308 --> 02:10:24.058]  I do all the audio production, and we have been able to sustain ourselves and our families with purely only support from the listeners, which we call producers because we expect them to produce with their time, their talent, or their treasure.
[02:10:24.785 --> 02:10:25.306]  Thank you.
[02:10:39.935 --> 02:10:41.417]  That's what we'll be gone after.
[02:10:55.495 --> 02:11:06.740]  Whether it's CNN or ABC News or any of these places, they're extincting themselves because they're owned and controlled by corporate interests that simply use them as a repeater system.
[02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:08.101]  And the public has figured that out.
[02:11:08.101 --> 02:11:11.802]  But they can't stop because their sponsors won't let them.
[02:11:11.802 --> 02:11:14.984]  And anybody that's had sponsors learns over time they try to take control of your life.
[02:11:14.984 --> 02:11:17.365]  That's why we moved to direct sale of products.
[02:11:18.203 --> 02:11:21.584]  At InfoWarsTore.com, our radio and TV stations still have their ads.
[02:11:21.584 --> 02:11:25.686]  That's what people hear during most of the breaks, is the affiliates break.
[02:11:25.686 --> 02:11:31.848]  But absolutely, and so as this decentralization happens, they've had this big concerted effort.
[02:11:31.848 --> 02:11:42.832]  I remember a Wall Street Journal article five years ago that was a subscriber article, but the article that linked to it, that had some excerpts, was I think Gizmodo, and it had the headline, hold on to your tinfoil hat
[02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:46.192]  Alex Jones, you're about to be taken off the air.
[02:11:46.192 --> 02:12:01.503]  And in that big 25-page article that it linked to out of the Wall Street Journal, they said, this was an article before News Corp split and sold off entertainment to Disney, and then kept its news division, the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and the local stations they own, and systems.
[02:12:02.245 --> 02:12:18.117]  And they said in there, people gotta read this article, I read an article like 10 times back at the time, that's why I knew I was about to be deplatformed, they said, we're gonna censor Wikileaks, and when the left, when the corporate media censors it together, when the left accepts that, we'll have the left censored.
[02:12:18.117 --> 02:12:18.977]  That's how they saw it.
[02:12:18.977 --> 02:12:26.723]  And when we censor Alex Jones in the coming months, when the right wing doesn't stand up for him, we'll set the president to censor them, so it's Jack Spratt
[02:12:27.662 --> 02:12:28.022]  We're good to go.
[02:12:57.131 --> 02:13:03.614]  We're working with major governments and corporations and big tech to bring in a new dark age of censorship against everybody.
[02:13:03.614 --> 02:13:08.756]  And when they don't stand up to the first domino with Julian Assange and Alex Jones, all the dominoes will go down.
[02:13:08.756 --> 02:13:10.896]  But yes, there's been massive censorship.
[02:13:10.896 --> 02:13:12.937]  Yes, they even censor a former president.
[02:13:12.937 --> 02:13:15.778]  But it's backfiring even more now, in my view.
[02:13:15.778 --> 02:13:20.380]  Can you give us your take on my analysis, if you think it's accurate, and how you see this fight unfolding?
[02:13:21.867 --> 02:13:30.954]  It is accurate, but what's interesting is everyone, most people I think are looking at media the wrong way now.
[02:13:30.954 --> 02:13:47.647]  Once the guardrails, the gatekeepers were removed, so what I mean by that is, and this was part of, I don't want to call it a vision, but when I approached Dave Weiner to implement some technical changes in RSS for podcasting,
[02:13:48.147 --> 02:13:54.291]  You know, this was part, it was all part of solving a way to use the internet to broadcast.
[02:13:54.291 --> 02:13:57.193]  And the whole point was, you know, we don't need transmitters.
[02:13:57.193 --> 02:13:58.013]  By the way, take your time.
[02:13:58.013 --> 02:14:02.756]  Stop, stop, because you are credited as being the founder of the podcast idea.
[02:14:02.756 --> 02:14:04.737]  Not just your new show in the last 15 years.
[02:14:04.737 --> 02:14:07.119]  Yeah, new, but relatively new.
[02:14:07.119 --> 02:14:12.702]  But going back, take your time here, because you are an expert on this, explaining this
[02:14:14.643 --> 02:14:19.989]  Handing over of power or keys to the public and this giant revolution has changed the whole world.
[02:14:19.989 --> 02:14:21.891]  This is one hell of an achievement.
[02:14:21.891 --> 02:14:28.418]  I mean, this is like literally the Wright Brothers and Kitty Hawk or Henry Ford and his assembly line.
[02:14:28.418 --> 02:14:29.719]  And I'm not blowing smoke.
[02:14:29.719 --> 02:14:30.500]  This is real, Adam.
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:31.240]  This is a big deal.
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:32.522]  So take your time on this.
[02:14:34.018 --> 02:14:59.817]  It's fun to see that the core of podcasting is this one little thing called RSS, which is, you can make it in a notepad, you can write one yourself, you know, you typically have a hosting company, but it's just an XML is what it is, it's a part of, you know, it's a computer readable instruction text file, which you can, computers can read it, but as a human you can read it as well.
[02:15:00.877 --> 02:15:11.023]  And because it's exactly that simple, anybody with one of these files and an mp3 recorder and a web server can create a podcast.
[02:15:11.023 --> 02:15:16.206]  So how did you visionaries see that decentralization and then help get the code change and launch it?
[02:15:16.206 --> 02:15:17.067]  Because this is a big deal.
[02:15:18.969 --> 02:15:22.612]  Honestly, I didn't see the decentralization in that manner at the time.
[02:15:22.612 --> 02:15:25.094]  What I saw, I just wanted to do a radio show.
[02:15:25.094 --> 02:15:27.676]  I was like, you know, it's a pain.
[02:15:27.676 --> 02:15:47.112]  People have no idea what it's really like to be in mainstream because you really are very, there's line producers and people, you know, you can't say this, you can't say that, there's people in your ear talking on the radio, you know, we have this famously, oh goodness, the hotline is going, that's the PD, the program director, I screwed up, I said something wrong, you know, whatever it is.
[02:15:49.465 --> 02:15:49.905]  without InfoWars.
[02:15:49.905 --> 02:15:57.073]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[02:16:11.024 --> 02:16:27.228]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[02:16:27.228 --> 02:16:36.290]  The only reason Humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:39.322]  I don't take the credit.
[02:16:39.322 --> 02:16:41.023]  I give you the credit.
[02:16:41.023 --> 02:16:43.645]  And now, InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[02:16:43.645 --> 02:16:45.246]  It isn't going to give up.
[02:16:45.246 --> 02:16:47.088]  Without your support, we could be shut down.

[02:16:57.773 --> 02:17:02.674]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[02:17:02.674 --> 02:17:09.056]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[02:17:09.056 --> 02:17:14.197]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[02:17:14.197 --> 02:17:15.897]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[02:17:15.897 --> 02:17:17.298]  Yes, I've persevered.
[02:17:17.298 --> 02:17:22.319]  But the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had the success.
[02:17:23.039 --> 02:17:28.484]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[02:17:28.484 --> 02:17:41.836]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:17:41.836 --> 02:17:43.377]  God bless you all.
[02:17:43.377 --> 02:17:44.438]  I salute you.
[02:17:44.438 --> 02:17:46.160]  I thank you and I beg you
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:51.569]  To intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[02:17:51.569 --> 02:17:52.872]  The fight is my fight.
[02:17:52.872 --> 02:17:53.513]  It's your fight.
[02:17:53.513 --> 02:17:54.254]  It's our fight.
[02:17:54.254 --> 02:17:55.056]  God bless you all.
[02:17:59.105 --> 02:18:00.927]  X3.
[02:18:00.927 --> 02:18:03.869]  It stands for tri-iodine.
[02:18:03.869 --> 02:18:09.733]  All three types of iodine that the body needs to be healthy and survive and thrive.
[02:18:09.733 --> 02:18:14.136]  It boosts your libido, your energy, your stamina, your immune system.

[02:18:45.809 --> 02:18:48.509]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[02:18:48.509 --> 02:18:50.310]  You need to experience it.
[02:18:50.310 --> 02:18:50.790]  Don't wait.

[02:18:56.538 --> 02:18:58.899]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[02:18:58.899 --> 02:19:00.499]  It's the bad halogen.
[02:19:00.499 --> 02:19:04.341]  To the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[02:19:04.341 --> 02:19:06.021]  What's the good halogen?
[02:19:06.021 --> 02:19:08.822]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[02:19:58.344 --> 02:20:04.227]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:17.492 --> 02:20:22.635]  David Icke, ladies and gentlemen, uncensored, unfiltered, straight ahead.
[02:20:22.635 --> 02:20:27.558]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:20:27.558 --> 02:20:29.840]  Talk, if you can, for a moment about the safety.
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:33.202]  What have you learned about serious side effects in this vaccine?
[02:20:41.926 --> 02:20:49.365]  Do you anticipate or maybe stay up at night thinking about the possibility you're going to have to go back in the lab at some point and come up with something better?
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:21:02.783]  Many of your medicines we know from the COVID vaccine, very effective, very welcome.
[02:21:02.783 --> 02:21:06.905]  The logistics around that vaccine were not straightforward because of the new technology.
[02:21:06.905 --> 02:21:09.906]  It's not like we control the world.
[02:21:09.906 --> 02:21:12.007]  All rise for the reptilian anthem!
[02:21:25.868 --> 02:21:27.871]  Let's get down to business.
[02:21:27.871 --> 02:21:29.614]  Let's talk about Reptoids.
[02:21:29.614 --> 02:21:34.321]  Be sure to follow these do's and don'ts to avoid a diplomatic incident.
[02:21:34.321 --> 02:21:38.166]  Do offer them a cricket, mouse, or vole out of your pocket.
[02:21:38.166 --> 02:21:41.071]  Fun fact about voles, a vole ain't my father.
[02:21:42.157 --> 02:21:48.383]  Don't use loaded phrases like, hissy fit, or see you later alligator.
[02:21:48.383 --> 02:21:50.105]  Got it, be respectful.
[02:21:50.105 --> 02:21:51.946]  So when do we talk about the orgies?
[02:21:51.946 --> 02:21:53.088]  Oh, come on!
[02:21:53.088 --> 02:21:56.531]  So the song Shake It Off was about how I shed my skin every thousand years.
[02:21:56.531 --> 02:21:59.674]  And the song Bad Blood was about how I drink blood out of my Grammys.
[02:21:59.674 --> 02:22:03.377]  A toast to blood!
[02:22:03.377 --> 02:22:04.719]  Save some blood for Paul Rudd!
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:09.282]  I gave you my kidney!
[02:22:09.282 --> 02:22:11.124]  And it was delicious!
[02:22:11.124 --> 02:22:18.751]  Uh, Reagan, meet my favorite reptoid zentitives, Barb Shrike and Zarthax Griswold Walton of the Reptoid High Council.
[02:22:18.751 --> 02:22:21.233]  Good evening, your, uh, lizardness.
[02:22:21.233 --> 02:22:23.615]  We reptoids have had a great decade.
[02:22:23.615 --> 02:22:31.363]  Thanks to propaganda in the media, we have made society more tolerant of our kind, from the geico gecko to the shape of water.
[02:22:32.283 --> 02:22:35.365]  We even got K. Rool in Smash!
[02:22:35.365 --> 02:22:36.466]  We did it, everyone!
[02:22:36.466 --> 02:22:38.707]  The world temperature is rising.
[02:22:38.707 --> 02:22:40.368]  The time is coming, brethren.
[02:22:40.368 --> 02:22:52.895]  Soon we shall fulfill the prophecy, overthrow humanity, and become the true rulers of the world!
[02:22:52.895 --> 02:22:53.796]  Bizarre video.
[02:22:53.796 --> 02:22:55.337]  Pfizer CEO shocks the world.
[02:22:55.337 --> 02:22:56.737]  Banned out video.
[02:22:56.737 --> 02:23:00.980]  We're having a little fun here, and I got David Icahn on this emergency Saturday show because I want to cover
[02:23:02.811 --> 02:23:15.466]  The wheels coming off this, the whole Pfizer, COVID hysteria, them admitting it erases your immune system, it kills you, euthanizing the old people, Russia, the pipeline, Elon Musk and his AI robots.
[02:23:15.466 --> 02:23:19.851]  So much to talk about with the iconic David Icke, DavidIcke.com or Iconic.com.
[02:23:19.851 --> 02:23:22.855]  He has his own channel on Bandop Video, David Icke.
[02:23:23.519 --> 02:23:24.880]  David, great to have you here.
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:26.141]  It's commercial free.
[02:23:26.141 --> 02:23:27.342]  We got about 50 minutes with you.
[02:23:27.342 --> 02:23:29.004]  I appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:23:29.004 --> 02:23:31.005]  I'm going to try to sit back and let you roll here.
[02:23:31.005 --> 02:23:32.767]  Love the new studio.
[02:23:32.767 --> 02:23:35.489]  Love how you've been fighting back and not giving in to the censorship.
[02:23:35.489 --> 02:23:37.531]  So you're quite the icon here.
[02:23:37.531 --> 02:23:38.511]  Total trailblazer.
[02:23:38.511 --> 02:23:40.593]  Great to have you here with us.
[02:23:40.593 --> 02:23:41.234]  Thanks, mate.
[02:23:41.234 --> 02:23:51.042]  I'll tell you what, it might be a good place to start, you know, with the subject in the intro, because
[02:23:52.441 --> 02:23:58.703]  When I came out with all that stuff a long time ago now, decades ago.
[02:23:58.703 --> 02:24:00.403]  Thirty years ago.
[02:24:00.403 --> 02:24:09.225]  That it's, in the end, what you're looking at is a non-human force manipulating human society.
[02:24:09.225 --> 02:24:15.787]  Of course, people thought that was crazy and that was ridiculous and he's crazy and he's mad and all the rest of it.
[02:24:16.798 --> 02:24:44.743]  But as it's become more and more obvious, Alex, that what we're looking at is an anti-human agenda, in which the very basics of human survival are being very blatantly targeted, more and more and more people are beginning to ask the question, well, maybe if we're looking at this extreme anti-human agenda,
[02:24:45.959 --> 02:24:50.741]  Maybe there's a non-human force behind it then.
[02:24:50.741 --> 02:24:55.324]  Because we're looking at, look at the basics, the basics of life.
[02:24:55.324 --> 02:25:01.087]  The food, warmth, the atmosphere is being changed.
[02:25:01.087 --> 02:25:09.811]  And you are looking at water supplies and access increasingly being targeted.
[02:25:10.581 --> 02:25:16.106]  All these different areas of basic human survival are being targeted.
[02:25:16.106 --> 02:25:26.276]  And then you look at the human body, which is, as they call it, a biological phenomenon.
[02:25:26.276 --> 02:25:33.343]  And then you see these fake vaccines, which they've created this COVID hoax to justify, of course.
[02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:59.400]  And they're putting synthetic genetic material into the body, which as we've seen many, many, many times now, is self-replicating and building nanotechnology systems, which, I say, are designed to connect the human body, the human brain, to what they call the cloud.
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:03.162]  And at the same time, the cloud is being created
[02:26:04.039 --> 02:26:22.551]  Not just by 5G towers and 6G and 7G in the pipeline, but from increasingly from low orbit satellites, vast numbers of them being put up there by Elon Musk, who's supposed to be a man of the people who cares about our freedom of speech.
[02:26:22.551 --> 02:26:32.598]  Well, it's funny because creating this cloud and then connecting the human brain to it via nanotechnology
[02:26:33.394 --> 02:26:37.295]  is straight off the script of this global cult, as I call it.
[02:26:37.295 --> 02:26:48.259]  And this global cult is the same cult that's behind the global destruction of freedom of speech and all the censorship.
[02:26:48.259 --> 02:27:03.003]  So, you know, I think what we need to do a little bit, those that are beginning to see this, is to realize where it's coming from.
[02:27:04.764 --> 02:27:20.652]  From where I come from is that this world we call the human world, the so-called physical world that we're interacting with, that's like a movie screen.
[02:27:20.652 --> 02:27:27.835]  When it hits the movie screen, if you're sitting in a movie theater, when the film hits the screen, it's a done deal.
[02:27:27.835 --> 02:27:29.696]  You're not changing it then.
[02:27:29.696 --> 02:27:33.958]  You're changing it from where it's being projected from, where it's coming from.
[02:27:35.066 --> 02:27:54.181]  And the reason that the nature of reality, the nature of the true I, is not taught in the schools and the universities, it's not explored by the media, is because we're not meant to know that.
[02:27:54.181 --> 02:28:00.986]  Because once we realize the nature of reality, the nature of the I, the nature of who we are, the nature of what this is,
[02:28:01.983 --> 02:28:09.429]  The pennies drop on how the whole thing, the whole deal, is being orchestrated.
[02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:13.572]  And that's what I go into in my new book just out called The Trap.
[02:28:13.572 --> 02:28:27.404]  So, first of all, we have to realize, if we're going to grasp this, is what we call the world of the scene is not everything that exists in the space that we're looking at.
[02:28:27.404 --> 02:28:31.387]  It's a tiny, tiny, ridiculously tiny band of frequency
[02:28:32.142 --> 02:28:32.903]  It's our best seller.
[02:28:58.629 --> 02:29:02.392]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[02:29:02.392 --> 02:29:11.479]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[02:29:11.479 --> 02:29:14.082]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[02:29:14.082 --> 02:29:20.727]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[02:29:20.727 --> 02:29:21.748]  It has all the minerals.
[02:29:22.268 --> 02:29:27.834]  All the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[02:29:27.834 --> 02:29:30.437]  Essential means without these things you die.
[02:29:30.437 --> 02:29:38.546]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[02:29:38.546 --> 02:29:40.769]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[02:29:41.249 --> 02:29:45.450]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.
[02:29:45.450 --> 02:29:47.931]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today.
[02:29:47.931 --> 02:29:53.213]  Getting Vitamineral Fusion finally back in stock at InfoWareStore.com for 50% off.
[02:29:53.213 --> 02:29:55.894]  Vitamineral Fusion, back in stock, InfoWareStore.com.
[02:29:56.510 --> 02:30:09.260]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:11.722]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[02:30:12.483 --> 02:30:21.366]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people don't listen, and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[02:30:21.366 --> 02:30:23.367]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[02:30:23.367 --> 02:30:24.887]  I don't plan to miss your health.
[02:30:24.887 --> 02:30:32.490]  But if I wasn't taking products like X3 from m4warshaw.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[02:30:33.010 --> 02:30:37.651]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible.
[02:30:37.651 --> 02:30:44.373]  And despite the fact that selling out, X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:44.373 --> 02:30:47.054]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[02:30:47.054 --> 02:30:48.314]  We're not selling it for that.
[02:30:48.314 --> 02:30:51.755]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[02:30:51.755 --> 02:30:55.336]  Get X3 today, 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:55.336 --> 02:30:56.096]  All supplies last.
[02:30:56.596 --> 02:30:58.197]  Look around you.
[02:30:58.197 --> 02:31:03.199]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[02:31:03.199 --> 02:31:07.101]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[02:31:07.101 --> 02:31:16.426]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[02:31:16.426 --> 02:31:22.089]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[02:31:22.089 --> 02:31:25.691]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[02:31:26.531 --> 02:31:29.635]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[02:31:29.635 --> 02:31:35.942]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[02:31:35.942 --> 02:31:37.223]  It's unsustainable.
[02:31:37.223 --> 02:31:38.444]  So please, visit.
[02:31:39.534 --> 02:31:41.515]  SaveInfoWars.com.

[02:31:49.621 --> 02:31:52.623]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[02:31:52.623 --> 02:31:53.943]  Thank you for your support.
[02:31:53.943 --> 02:31:55.044]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[02:32:52.875 --> 02:32:54.335]  It's a critical fight.
[02:32:54.335 --> 02:32:58.317]  Visit InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:32:58.317 --> 02:33:04.219]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.125 --> 02:33:13.887]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:13.887 --> 02:33:19.291]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.291 --> 02:33:21.914]  The band we can see is a tiny part.
[02:33:21.914 --> 02:33:26.778]  That spectrum itself is only around 0.005% of what exists in what they call the universe.
[02:33:39.887 --> 02:33:44.429]  So, we are seeing next to nothing.
[02:33:44.429 --> 02:34:02.395]  And to understand that is to grasp how these non-human entities, in the end, this consciousness that's manipulating human society, can do it without us being, it being, seen, us seeing.
[02:34:02.395 --> 02:34:08.878]  And David, to interrupt, as you've been saying for 30 years, because I've read most of your books, haven't read the new one, but I read the first book she wrote 30 years ago that had been proven to be that on,
[02:34:09.697 --> 02:34:24.493]  They don't even want us in the visual light spectrum, they want us in the VR, in the Matrix, they want to even get us out of what we can see at this level to be able to totally confuse us, and that's part of the lockdowns they now admit was forcing us into the metaverse.
[02:34:24.493 --> 02:34:31.100]  Yeah, I mean, from where I'm coming from, and you know, just after the turn of the millennium, I said that
[02:34:32.449 --> 02:34:37.333]  This reality is actually a simulation.
[02:34:37.333 --> 02:34:39.054]  It's a virtual reality.
[02:34:39.054 --> 02:34:46.119]  It's an illusion to confuse us and to hijack our perception of reality.
[02:34:46.119 --> 02:34:55.326]  And I said at that time that the limit of this simulation at the level we experience it as the human world
[02:34:56.634 --> 02:34:59.935]  Uh, because there are other levels of it, which I talk about in the trap.
[02:34:59.935 --> 02:35:04.377]  Um, that, um, limit is the speed of light.
[02:35:04.377 --> 02:35:10.398]  So, uh, the speed of light is not the fastest speed possible, as, you know, people like Einstein said.
[02:35:10.398 --> 02:35:11.399]  No, no!
[02:35:11.399 --> 02:35:13.759]  It's pedestrian, compared with what's possible.
[02:35:13.759 --> 02:35:21.662]  But it is the limit of this simulation, which is why it appears to be the fastest speed, when you're in the simulation.
[02:35:21.662 --> 02:35:23.683]  And then, in the spring of 2021,
[02:35:25.609 --> 02:35:41.362]  Scientific American ran a story, an article by an academic, and he said that he concluded that we live in a simulation and the limit of the simulation is the speed of light.
[02:35:41.362 --> 02:35:52.732]  And one of the things I've been saying over the decades is that what we call the laws of physics are actually the coding
[02:35:53.775 --> 02:35:56.717]  That's written into the simulation.
[02:35:56.717 --> 02:36:11.586]  So when you're creating a virtual reality game, which mimics the reality we're in, you write the codes, you write the rules of the game, the limits of the game, what you can do, what you can't do.
[02:36:11.586 --> 02:36:16.008]  And what we call the laws of physics are actually
[02:36:17.815 --> 02:36:23.678]  The rules of the simulation, which have been put in there as part of the control system.
[02:36:23.678 --> 02:36:40.468]  And what this academic said in Scientific American is that we live in a simulation, its limit is the speed of light, and he related, and I say quite rightly, the speed of light to processing speed.
[02:36:40.468 --> 02:36:44.430]  So if you're writing a virtual reality computer game,
[02:36:45.149 --> 02:36:54.036]  Then you write the rules, but even though you're doing that, you're still limited by your processing speed, as this article said.
[02:36:54.036 --> 02:36:57.079]  And so that's the limit of the simulation.
[02:36:57.079 --> 02:37:01.403]  And so this is like a projection.
[02:37:01.403 --> 02:37:08.048]  I do explain in the books how it's created, how we actually create it, in fact.
[02:37:08.048 --> 02:37:10.250]  But it's the projection.
[02:37:10.250 --> 02:37:12.752]  So the question is, where does the projection come from?
[02:37:13.388 --> 02:37:32.944]  Where does this... because, you know, if you look at the Matrix movie, Alex, and the symbolism of them, the Neo and Morpheus, etc., they're in the ship, they're outside the Matrix, outside of it.
[02:37:32.944 --> 02:37:40.070]  And so what happens is they go into the Matrix with that probe in the back of the neck, actually in the reptilian brain part,
[02:37:40.689 --> 02:37:40.869]  Thank you.
[02:38:01.124 --> 02:38:02.285]  OK.
[02:38:02.285 --> 02:38:15.533]  Basically, there's a little bit more to it than this, yes, but basically, a way of putting it really simply, is if you can't see it, then it's not in this dimension.
[02:38:15.533 --> 02:38:17.255]  And so it's in another dimension.
[02:38:18.763 --> 02:38:20.404]  You can see a brain.
[02:38:20.404 --> 02:38:22.504]  Yeah, okay, there's the brain.
[02:38:22.504 --> 02:38:25.486]  Well, therefore, it's in this reality.
[02:38:25.486 --> 02:38:27.046]  We'll call it 3D reality.
[02:38:27.046 --> 02:38:28.387]  There it is, the brain.
[02:38:28.387 --> 02:38:33.949]  But the brain is not the source of consciousness.
[02:38:33.949 --> 02:38:38.310]  What it does is process information.
[02:38:38.310 --> 02:38:39.911]  It's the receiver.
[02:38:39.911 --> 02:38:43.032]  Yeah, it's a receiver in that sense.
[02:38:43.032 --> 02:38:44.893]  It processes information.
[02:38:44.893 --> 02:38:48.054]  Now, the question is, where does that information come from?
[02:38:48.962 --> 02:38:57.049]  Because we have this whole concept now, although science denied it, right up to quite recently.
[02:38:57.049 --> 02:39:02.354]  I mean, what you said 25 years ago is now accepted mainline science.
[02:39:02.354 --> 02:39:04.195]  I read it in Scientific America, everywhere.
[02:39:04.195 --> 02:39:06.858]  All the big billionaires, they sound like David Icke now.
[02:39:06.858 --> 02:39:14.004]  But they say, oh, we're going to jack into it and create a new reality for you, instead of not letting you know that we can break free of this as well.
[02:39:15.427 --> 02:39:18.508]  I mean, obviously, they're not going to bring us into some bigger, better reality.
[02:39:18.508 --> 02:39:22.709]  Everything they do is to make the reality smaller and more controlled.
[02:39:22.709 --> 02:39:25.850]  More and more myopia of sense of reality.
[02:39:25.850 --> 02:39:27.331]  That's what the metaverse is about.
[02:39:27.331 --> 02:39:31.372]  It's about creating a simulation within a simulation.
[02:39:31.372 --> 02:39:34.273]  In fact, a simulation within a simulation within a simulation.
[02:39:34.273 --> 02:39:37.094]  So you've got the simulation we call the human world.
[02:39:37.094 --> 02:39:40.855]  Then you've got the smart grid, which is actually another simulation.
[02:39:41.511 --> 02:39:52.434]  And then you've got the metaverse, which is another simulation, so... And they admit the Internet of Things, the smart grid, is a new world, they call it, a new dimension they're creating, of the machines interfacing and directing us.
[02:39:52.434 --> 02:39:53.894]  So it's a prison grid.
[02:39:53.894 --> 02:39:59.296]  That's exactly what they're doing, and that's why people should look at Elon Musk and ask, what the heck are you doing?
[02:39:59.296 --> 02:40:02.657]  Because almost virtually... No, no, no, no, not virtually.
[02:40:02.657 --> 02:40:06.098]  Everything he does and produces is straight off the script of the cult.
[02:40:08.038 --> 02:40:14.263]  But I was saying, you've got the brain, so you can see that, that's in this reality, and it's processing information.
[02:40:14.263 --> 02:40:25.291]  And this concept of brain placidity, there's a placidity about the brain in this sense.
[02:40:25.291 --> 02:40:32.536]  They believed until relatively recently that once the brain formed, that was it, that was the brain for your life.
[02:40:32.536 --> 02:40:34.338]  Now they know very different.
[02:40:34.338 --> 02:40:37.100]  They know that the brain changes
[02:40:38.058 --> 02:40:41.859]  According to the information it receives.
[02:40:41.859 --> 02:40:46.180]  So if you have one source of information, i.e.
[02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:57.223]  the cult narrative, let's say, in all its forms, and you never look outside of that for other forms of information and other explanations, your brain, and this is mainstream science now,
[02:40:57.927 --> 02:41:07.774]  Your brain will process information and all the neurons and the neuron networks will form to process that information.
[02:41:07.774 --> 02:41:10.917]  And let me interrupt you because you're right, this is mainline science now.
[02:41:10.917 --> 02:41:16.201]  Blue Light is making little girls go into puberty earlier just from iPads and screens.
[02:41:16.201 --> 02:41:18.482]  That's mainline scientific study two weeks ago.
[02:41:18.482 --> 02:41:23.326]  And they admit that people that watch more TV, that isn't interactive, people that just sit there and vegetate,
[02:41:23.866 --> 02:41:36.733]  Don't grow the new neuron networks and literally get early onset of Alzheimer's and die early and they admit young people in South Korea are dying from watching 20 hours of television a day because your body just literally turns off.
[02:41:36.733 --> 02:41:39.874]  Bottom line, this stuff is killing us.
[02:41:39.874 --> 02:41:51.180]  A very simple way of doing an analogy for this is imagine that you had Wi-Fi
[02:41:52.910 --> 02:42:13.821]  which is outside the computer or around us, but you program the computer not to read, decode, process vast amounts of information in Wi-Fi.
[02:42:13.821 --> 02:42:16.583]  What you would do, the information would still be there,
[02:42:17.856 --> 02:42:32.545]  But it wouldn't be in a form that you could see and interact with because the computer would not take that Wi-Fi and put it on the screen in the form of words, graphics, moving pictures, and so on.
[02:42:32.545 --> 02:42:35.327]  And that's what they're doing with the human brain.
[02:42:35.327 --> 02:42:40.070]  They are, because they know about this malleable nature of the brain,
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:48.605]  They are trying, this is one level of it, they're trying to just let you have one source of information.
[02:42:48.605 --> 02:42:56.670]  It's what censorship's all about.
[02:42:56.670 --> 02:42:59.512]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[02:42:59.512 --> 02:43:05.756]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge, tip of the spear.
[02:43:05.756 --> 02:43:09.698]  And when we talk about the products in InfoWareStore.com, they all blow you away.
[02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.949]  We're good to go.
[02:43:29.648 --> 02:43:41.931]  So X3, despite the fact it was run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now at InfoWarStore.com and it funds the InfoWar, which is a 360 win.

[02:44:53.082 --> 02:44:54.564]  It's a critical fight.
[02:44:54.564 --> 02:44:56.006]  Visit InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:44:56.414 --> 02:44:59.615]  Look, it's not hype that InfoWars has changed the world.
[02:44:59.615 --> 02:45:04.136]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars is the reason we were able to do this.
[02:45:04.136 --> 02:45:05.837]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[02:45:05.837 --> 02:45:09.738]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table?
[02:45:09.738 --> 02:45:13.639]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[02:45:13.639 --> 02:45:16.179]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells.
[02:45:16.179 --> 02:45:17.340]  It doesn't just give you more energy.
[02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:18.480]  It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[02:45:18.980 --> 02:45:25.183]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[02:45:25.183 --> 02:45:29.585]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.
[02:45:29.585 --> 02:45:33.627]  Take a few drops every day and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[02:45:33.627 --> 02:45:35.107]  Plus it funds the Infowar.
[02:45:35.107 --> 02:45:38.909]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[02:46:08.345 --> 02:46:09.966]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[02:46:09.966 --> 02:46:11.928]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[02:46:11.928 --> 02:46:17.191]  You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and free speech on the air, and I thank you.
[02:46:17.651 --> 02:46:21.956]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[02:46:21.956 --> 02:46:23.217]  And I need your support.
[02:46:23.217 --> 02:46:30.846]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:46:32.668 --> 02:46:39.674]  And SaveInfoWars.com takes you to a URL that gives him go for direct Alex Jones Legal Defense Fund.
[02:46:39.674 --> 02:46:44.218]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[02:46:44.218 --> 02:46:48.461]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[02:46:48.461 --> 02:46:55.868]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and justice in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[02:46:58.078 --> 02:47:13.562]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:13.562 --> 02:47:21.924]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:25.675 --> 02:47:31.119]  So that your brain forms, your neurons in your networks form to process that.
[02:47:31.119 --> 02:47:42.807]  And literally, if you're in that mode, and it solidifies enough, it doesn't matter what information you receive in other ways.
[02:47:42.807 --> 02:47:49.072]  Because this is why people look at others, say in the COVID era, and they say, look,
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:52.041]  Why can't they get it?
[02:47:52.041 --> 02:47:53.202]  It's so obvious!
[02:47:53.202 --> 02:48:02.406]  Well, it's obvious to you because your brain is in a state where it can process that information that sees through the illusion.
[02:48:02.406 --> 02:48:18.135]  But if you're stuck in this repetitive, that the brain will only decode certain information, which is basically frequencies, then you're literally not going to be able to compute
[02:48:19.207 --> 02:48:20.948]  What's actually happening?
[02:48:20.948 --> 02:48:24.350]  And this is why they want us only to see the mainstream media.
[02:48:24.350 --> 02:48:25.531]  Shut off all other media.
[02:48:25.531 --> 02:48:27.312]  That's why they're going for you.
[02:48:27.312 --> 02:48:32.515]  Because they want to control the source of information.
[02:48:32.515 --> 02:48:35.157]  Because from the information comes our perception.
[02:48:35.157 --> 02:48:39.760]  From our perception comes the way the brain wires itself.
[02:48:40.826 --> 02:49:07.921]  And they're terrified of other information being made available to people which will, over time, and with some who are more malleable immediately, will get them to see actually there's a different way of looking at the world and at that point the brain, in its malleable nature, will start changing and start firing in a different way and it will start processing another form, sense of reality and perception.
[02:49:07.921 --> 02:49:09.282]  Now that's what they don't want.
[02:49:10.142 --> 02:49:16.544]  What they have to do is hold us purely in five-sense reality.
[02:49:16.544 --> 02:49:25.987]  Because once we are processing information and processing our perceptions only through five-sense reality, they got us.
[02:49:25.987 --> 02:49:28.868]  We're in the trap, we're in the jail, we're in the cell.
[02:49:29.828 --> 02:49:36.451]  And so they are seeking to control, in every way, the information that we receive.
[02:49:36.451 --> 02:49:39.452]  And there's no doubt they're doing that, and you've been vindicated in spades.
[02:49:39.452 --> 02:49:42.534]  So big picture, because I want to go through a lot of current issues with you.
[02:49:42.534 --> 02:49:50.858]  How are things going for the architects of this post-human world, this cyborg takeover matrix they admit they're now launching?
[02:49:50.858 --> 02:49:52.478]  How would you lay out the current state of the world?
[02:49:52.478 --> 02:49:56.180]  Because it seems like there's a huge awakening happening, but they're also coming down on us with both feet.
[02:49:57.757 --> 02:50:09.383]  Yeah, I mean, we are in a real state of transition here and we go a certain way and we'll dismantle this.
[02:50:09.383 --> 02:50:13.266]  We go another way and it will get more and more extreme.
[02:50:13.266 --> 02:50:16.848]  And again, we come back to the same thing, Alex.
[02:50:16.848 --> 02:50:26.393]  The stadium in which this is all playing out and the stadium in which the outcome of the game will be decided
[02:50:27.306 --> 02:50:28.670]  Is the human mind.
[02:50:29.358 --> 02:50:30.358]  That's it!
[02:50:30.358 --> 02:50:36.100]  Because as I was saying, you can see the brain, so it's in this reality.
[02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:37.261]  So where's the mind?
[02:50:37.261 --> 02:50:41.962]  You can't see the mind, just as you can't see Wi-Fi, but you know it's there.
[02:50:41.962 --> 02:50:49.384]  The mind is on the level that we directly interact with, with the brain, is an electromagnetic field.
[02:50:49.384 --> 02:50:55.166]  That's beyond the limits of visible light, human sight, but it's there.
[02:50:55.166 --> 02:50:57.647]  It's in another, what you would call, dimension.
[02:50:58.527 --> 02:51:10.471]  And, you know, people talk about a dimension of reality that is very close to this one on the dial, and they call it the astral dimension.
[02:51:10.471 --> 02:51:12.831]  Some people call it the fourth dimension.
[02:51:12.831 --> 02:51:27.576]  And in the lower levels of that fourth dimension, that lower levels of that astral dimension, which is very close in frequency terms to this world, that's where it's being orchestrated from, as I go into at length in the chat.
[02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:39.487]  And, you know, this is where these entities are that are orchestrating this global cult in the world of the scenes with people like Schwab and Gates and all the rest of them.
[02:51:39.487 --> 02:51:43.850]  Talk about the trap, the new book and these entities.
[02:51:43.850 --> 02:51:55.178]  Well, once you realize, Alex, that this reality, this global conspiracy is ultimately being manipulated from this
[02:51:56.156 --> 02:52:00.557]  Lower fourth dimension, lower astral dimension.
[02:52:00.557 --> 02:52:04.278]  Then so much falls into place.
[02:52:04.278 --> 02:52:12.640]  Why do these people in the cult take part in satanism and satanic ritual?
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:15.841]  Because who are they interacting with?
[02:52:15.841 --> 02:52:18.761]  Because they are interacting with entities.
[02:52:18.761 --> 02:52:21.982]  I mean, these people may be mad, but they're not completely stupid.
[02:52:23.142 --> 02:52:31.325]  And they're interacting with these entities in this lower fourth, lower astral dimension from where all this is coming.
[02:52:31.325 --> 02:52:35.147]  So they do their rituals and they keep doing them.
[02:52:35.147 --> 02:52:47.592]  You know, you see when you look into this, and I know you have over the years, that they're doing Babylonian rituals, they're doing Egyptian rituals now.
[02:52:48.726 --> 02:52:49.827]  Why?
[02:52:49.827 --> 02:52:52.990]  Why are they doing ancient rituals now?
[02:52:52.990 --> 02:53:03.339]  Because those ancient rituals were specifically designed to create a vibrational environment which thins out
[02:53:04.119 --> 02:53:18.944]  The difference in frequency between this reality and this lower astral reality, and if you keep doing this in the same place over and over again, then it thins it out even more.
[02:53:18.944 --> 02:53:26.306]  And I've talked to people who've taken part in these rituals over the years, different parts of the world, because it's a global phenomenon.
[02:53:27.126 --> 02:53:39.197]  And they explain how these often hideous looking entities, often taking a reptilian form, not always but often, slip into this reality during the ritual.
[02:53:39.887 --> 02:53:48.531]  Where these Satanists and these Super Satanists, which is what the Elite are, are interacting with them.
[02:53:48.531 --> 02:53:55.315]  And so that's what they're doing, that's what the Rituals are for, to create this interaction.
[02:53:55.315 --> 02:53:58.997]  Now, what do Satanists do also?
[02:53:58.997 --> 02:54:04.039]  They sacrifice kids, they sacrifice adults too, but they sacrifice kids.
[02:54:04.039 --> 02:54:05.300]  Why do they do that?
[02:54:06.903 --> 02:54:23.296]  Why did the ancients say, in places like Central America and all over the world actually, say, Babylon, we are sacrificing young virgins, children, or someone else to the gods.
[02:54:23.296 --> 02:54:24.317]  What does that mean?
[02:54:24.317 --> 02:54:25.718]  Why would they do that?
[02:54:25.718 --> 02:54:34.985]  Because you come back to the Matrix movie and the Morpheus character, and he's holding up a battery
[02:54:35.732 --> 02:54:39.315]  And he says the machines have turned humans into one of these.
[02:54:39.315 --> 02:54:43.137]  In other words, a source of energy.
[02:54:43.137 --> 02:54:54.745]  Now these, in this lower astral dimension where all this is being orchestrated from, the vibration is very low and very slow.
[02:54:54.745 --> 02:54:57.367]  That's why they are what they are.
[02:54:57.367 --> 02:55:03.051]  That's why they are so what we would call evil, which I define as the absence of love.
[02:55:03.988 --> 02:55:18.337]  And so to absorb energy from another source, that energy has to be within the frequency band that these entities operate on.
[02:55:18.337 --> 02:55:24.360]  Otherwise they can't absorb it, like two radio stations passing in the same space but not interfering with each other.
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:28.883]  The energy they want is the energy which is the energy of them,
[02:55:29.662 --> 02:55:38.389]  It's the energy of fear, the energy of terror, the energy of anxiety, of depression, all these low vibrational emotional human states.
[02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:40.091]  And that's what they wanted during the COVID deal.
[02:55:40.091 --> 02:55:44.314]  Record suicide, record depression, families breaking up, people isolated.
[02:55:44.314 --> 02:55:45.335]  That's what they feed off of.
[02:55:46.252 --> 02:55:55.395]  Yes, and you know, fear of nuclear war, fear of not having enough food, fear of the price of energy, all these things.
[02:55:55.395 --> 02:56:12.580]  You take a world war, it's a bloody banquet to these entities because of all the emotional charge that goes into fighting the war, all the emotional charge from people back home who are terrified that their loved one is not going to come home.
[02:56:12.580 --> 02:56:14.461]  So it's interdimensional transference of
[02:56:15.321 --> 02:56:17.243]  Of psychic energy.
[02:56:17.243 --> 02:56:19.064]  Of energy, yeah, of emotional energy.
[02:56:19.064 --> 02:56:29.330]  And so they've set up this reality to generate maximum amounts of low vibrational emotional energy.
[02:56:29.330 --> 02:56:30.851]  Of course, they've done it very well.
[02:56:30.851 --> 02:56:35.794]  And they are then feeding off this energy and it's empowering them.
[02:56:35.794 --> 02:56:38.836]  They don't want people getting on.
[02:56:39.594 --> 02:56:43.557]  They don't want people loving each other.
[02:56:43.557 --> 02:56:51.562]  They don't want people having joy and happiness and contentment, because these are high frequency energies.
[02:56:51.562 --> 02:56:59.407]  For instance, when you're in a low frequency state, a low emotional state, let's put it that way, but it's a low frequency state in other words,
[02:57:00.057 --> 02:57:04.979]  People say things like, I feel so heavy today.
[02:57:04.979 --> 02:57:06.099]  Why is that?
[02:57:06.099 --> 02:57:14.903]  Because that state of perception emotion is generating these low, slow frequencies.
[02:57:14.903 --> 02:57:21.445]  And studies are now showing that electromagnetic artificial 5G and other systems are actually making people depressed.
[02:57:21.445 --> 02:57:23.926]  So they're artificially putting us into that
[02:57:24.969 --> 02:57:26.710]  That type of system.
[02:57:26.710 --> 02:57:30.331]  I forget the name, but the crews will... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:57:30.331 --> 02:57:33.953]  And this is why, this is the point, this is why they're doing it.
[02:57:33.953 --> 02:57:47.479]  So when you are generating these low, slow frequencies through a low emotional state, or they're coming the other way... It's our best seller.
[02:57:48.595 --> 02:57:49.015]  We're good to go.
[02:58:04.002 --> 02:58:10.666]  Vitamin-mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[02:58:10.666 --> 02:58:17.790]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[02:58:17.790 --> 02:58:20.412]  Essential means without these things you die.
[02:58:20.412 --> 02:58:28.496]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[02:58:28.496 --> 02:58:30.718]  Now there are other great vitamin-mineral products out there.
[02:58:31.198 --> 02:58:35.402]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWars.
[02:58:35.402 --> 02:58:42.348]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting Vitamin Mineral Fusion finally back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com for 50% off.
[02:58:42.348 --> 02:58:46.591]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion back in stock, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:46.591 --> 02:58:51.435]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[02:58:51.435 --> 02:58:59.202]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[02:59:01.024 --> 02:59:17.233]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[02:59:17.233 --> 02:59:26.338]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[02:59:27.637 --> 02:59:29.318]  I don't take the credit.
[02:59:29.318 --> 02:59:31.040]  I give you the credit.
[02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:33.642]  And now, InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[02:59:33.642 --> 02:59:35.263]  It isn't going to give up.
[02:59:35.263 --> 02:59:37.105]  Without your support, we could be shut down.

[02:59:47.973 --> 02:59:53.878]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:00.353 --> 03:00:02.995]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:02.995 --> 03:00:10.682]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:10.682 --> 03:00:16.666]  Happiness and contentment, because these are high frequency energies.
[03:00:16.666 --> 03:00:24.493]  For instance, when you're in a low frequency state, a low emotional state, let's put it that way, but it's a low frequency state in other words,
[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:30.081]  People say things like, I feel so heavy today.
[03:00:30.081 --> 03:00:31.202]  Why is that?
[03:00:31.202 --> 03:00:39.224]  Because that state of perception emotion is generating these low frequencies.
[03:00:39.224 --> 03:00:45.465]  And studies are now showing that electromagnetic artificial 5G and others are actually making people depressed.
[03:00:45.465 --> 03:00:47.946]  So they're artificially putting us into that
[03:00:48.996 --> 03:00:50.736]  That type of system.
[03:00:50.736 --> 03:00:54.357]  I forget the name, but the crews... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:00:54.357 --> 03:00:57.978]  And this is why, this is the point, this is why they're doing it.
[03:00:57.978 --> 03:01:13.741]  So when you are generating these low, slow frequencies through a low emotional state, or they're coming the other way through this cloud and these low orbit satellites and towers, then
[03:01:15.161 --> 03:01:33.096]  The energy, the frequencies going through your energetic field are low and slow and so when that happens the field gets denser and you feel this, oh I feel so heavy, but when you feel joy and love and happiness, yeah life's great, then they are high, fast.
[03:01:34.657 --> 03:01:34.997]  I think so.
[03:01:57.952 --> 03:02:11.243]  Back in, I think it was the 1950s, that a guy studied the frequencies of different emotional states and actually listed what they were.
[03:02:11.243 --> 03:02:20.932]  And this is the point that we've already introduced, that yes, you can feel an emotional state and generate the frequency,
[03:02:21.860 --> 03:02:30.652]  But if the frequency relating to that emotional state is coming the other way through this bloody cloud, then the throttle goes both ways.
[03:02:30.652 --> 03:02:35.618]  And that's how all this mainstream television watching literally is causing Alzheimer's and killing people.
[03:02:35.618 --> 03:02:36.720]  Let me raise this point, David.
[03:02:38.952 --> 03:02:43.557]  How is this operation by this force running?
[03:02:43.557 --> 03:02:44.257]  How is there war?
[03:02:44.257 --> 03:02:46.800]  Because I asked you earlier, you said we're at crossroads.
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:48.801]  I agree, and how do we transcend it?
[03:02:48.801 --> 03:02:50.063]  Because here's an example.
[03:02:50.063 --> 03:02:58.871]  Certainly we see limited reality, but at one point in the universe of the dimensions, we're seeing what I believe is a limited layer of it, or what you call a simulation, but at least something tangible.
[03:02:58.871 --> 03:03:02.314]  Why, and literally as you know, thousands of studies, people don't need studies to know this,
[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:05.381]  You go swimming in the Caribbean or the Mediterranean.
[03:03:05.381 --> 03:03:11.502]  You go out on the stars at night with the moon with your friends and laugh and tell jokes by fire.
[03:03:11.502 --> 03:03:18.623]  You walk through the forest or the fields and you feel light and empowered and connected to the universe and God and the infinite.
[03:03:18.623 --> 03:03:26.565]  But then when you go and plug into the VR matrix, you feel nauseous, you feel sick, you feel depressed, you have nightmares, you don't sleep well.
[03:03:26.565 --> 03:03:29.746]  What is it about being out in nature that counteracts this?
[03:03:32.796 --> 03:03:39.919]  Well, what they're seeking to do is to negate that.
[03:03:39.919 --> 03:03:58.045]  See, at the moment, if you're in a city, I mean, China's the blueprint, obviously, you are bombarded with technologically generated electromagnetic fields that are designed to put you in these low vibrational states.
[03:03:59.170 --> 03:04:02.932]  But up to this point, you've been able to get out of there.
[03:04:02.932 --> 03:04:03.412]  Get out!
[03:04:03.412 --> 03:04:08.994]  I mean, you know, I talk about nature in a different way, but you can get away from that.
[03:04:08.994 --> 03:04:15.217]  You get out into the areas that are not subject to that bombardment.
[03:04:15.217 --> 03:04:28.003]  And therefore, you've, I mean, this is, these people that have this electrosensitivity, where they're so sensitive to electromagnetic fields generated technologically, that they become very, very sick.
[03:04:28.763 --> 03:04:37.350]  And they have to go and live in caravans in the forest to get away from it, because that's the only place that they don't feel sick.
[03:04:37.350 --> 03:04:48.199]  You have this, you know, this building syndrome where people get the same thing, where they work in an office surrounded by these, bombarded by these... Sure, what about the Havana syndrome?
[03:04:48.199 --> 03:04:53.703]  Even the top, it's more than 20 CIA scientists sent in who didn't think it was real.
[03:04:53.703 --> 03:04:55.345]  They're getting nauseous and super sick now.
[03:04:56.886 --> 03:05:09.535]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[03:05:09.535 --> 03:05:11.977]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[03:05:12.737 --> 03:05:21.641]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people don't listen, and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[03:05:21.641 --> 03:05:23.622]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[03:05:23.622 --> 03:05:25.142]  I don't plan to miss your health.
[03:05:25.142 --> 03:05:32.766]  But if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWarshaw.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[03:05:33.286 --> 03:05:37.911]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible.
[03:05:37.911 --> 03:05:44.638]  And despite the fact it's selling out, X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:44.638 --> 03:05:47.320]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[03:05:47.320 --> 03:05:48.582]  We're not selling it for that.
[03:05:48.582 --> 03:05:52.025]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[03:05:52.025 --> 03:05:55.609]  Get X3 today, 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:55.609 --> 03:05:56.370]  All supplies last.
[03:06:00.569 --> 03:06:06.775]  Well, here we are on the embattled Alex Jones broadcast on this Friday, October 14th worldwide transmission.
[03:06:06.775 --> 03:06:10.759]  We are now well into the amazing David Icke interview if you'd like to see it.
[03:06:11.849 --> 03:06:22.157]  Commercial free, or without the regular radio and TV ads programmed in, it'll be posted very soon at band.video later this afternoon.
[03:06:22.157 --> 03:06:29.222]  David's talking about the nature of reality, getting outside the box, and realizing the globalists are not in total control.
[03:06:29.222 --> 03:06:36.107]  If we decide to be in control and then act collectively as individuals together, we are unstoppable.
[03:06:36.107 --> 03:06:36.788]  And just remember,
[03:06:38.914 --> 03:06:49.541]  Folks around the world, not just in the US, are rallying to InfoWars support right now, because they saw how when we got deplatformed four years ago, that was then used as a model against everybody else.
[03:06:49.541 --> 03:06:55.706]  And so finally people are really getting it, and quite frankly, all this persecution has been a blessing.
[03:06:55.706 --> 03:07:06.473]  If they can't convince us to give up, if they can't convince us they're winning and they're in the wrong, and if they can't play a mind trick, a Jedi mind trick, to make us believe they're propaganda, it's game over for them.
[03:07:07.489 --> 03:07:09.850]  It is the Emperor's New Clothes.
[03:07:09.850 --> 03:07:12.791]  It is the Wizard of Oz and the Man Behind the Curtain.
[03:07:12.791 --> 03:07:18.874]  So, let's go back here in the fourth hour to most of the rest of the David Icke interview.
[03:07:18.874 --> 03:07:28.598]  And then again, there's about 20 minutes or so we won't get to that'll be posted again in full, but the 20 minutes you missed at band.video a little bit later this afternoon.
[03:07:28.598 --> 03:07:31.179]  Again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:07:31.179 --> 03:07:32.380]  We've seen an outpouring.
[03:07:32.380 --> 03:07:34.601]  We were back in the red in the last month.
[03:07:35.308 --> 03:07:35.588]  We're good.
[03:08:01.834 --> 03:08:07.495]  I appreciate you, and I encourage those that haven't to make a donation, whether it's $5, $10, whatever you can.
[03:08:07.495 --> 03:08:13.216]  I really appreciate it, and your freedom will appreciate it as well at SaveInfoWars.com.
[03:08:13.216 --> 03:08:16.377]  But whatever you do, get the amazing products that are so incredible.
[03:08:16.377 --> 03:08:19.838]  There's global runs on iodine all over the world.
[03:08:19.838 --> 03:08:21.658]  People are figuring out how important it is.
[03:08:21.658 --> 03:08:23.258]  We've got the very, very best.
[03:08:23.258 --> 03:08:25.299]  Here's the headline.
[03:08:25.299 --> 03:08:25.559]  Why?
[03:08:26.522 --> 03:08:29.944]  The war in Ukraine has countries stockpiling ionine tablets.
[03:08:29.944 --> 03:08:34.488]  That is out of LA Times.
[03:08:34.488 --> 03:08:36.349]  I talked about it some in the first hour.
[03:08:36.349 --> 03:08:38.771]  So these are some of the big issues going on.
[03:08:38.771 --> 03:08:40.392]  We don't sell it for nuclear war.
[03:08:40.392 --> 03:08:44.535]  We sell it because it's so powerful for what it does for everything else in your body, including
[03:08:45.603 --> 03:08:49.344]  Your energy, your libido, but more importantly, your immune system.
[03:08:49.344 --> 03:08:59.267]  X3 in stock, 60% off at Infowarstore.com, even though it's selling out, we're keeping it at that price with promo code 1776.
[03:08:59.267 --> 03:09:05.509]  All you do is put that number in, and instead of 50% off, you get 60% off and double Patriot points on X3.
[03:09:06.667 --> 03:09:08.668]  All right, let's go back to the rest of the incredible David Icke interview.
[03:09:28.092 --> 03:09:33.975]  Well, you know, it could be any source of generating electromagnetic field.
[03:09:33.975 --> 03:09:43.901]  So these satellites that are going up through people like Musk, who's looking at 42,000, well, I say eventually, that's the number being given now.
[03:09:45.131 --> 03:09:54.574]  They're seeking to take out or generate these fields of 5G and what follows to every inch of the planet.
[03:09:54.574 --> 03:10:02.577]  And they need to do that in their agenda because they want to connect, not least through what's going into people with these fake vaccines.
[03:10:02.577 --> 03:10:09.939]  And of course, these fake vaccines are planned to be transferred to every other vaccine.
[03:10:10.629 --> 03:10:16.415]  And any other ones that they can justify and come up with with their excuses.
[03:10:16.415 --> 03:10:24.302]  And therefore, if they're going to connect every human to artificial intelligence via the cloud, as they call it,
[03:10:28.328 --> 03:10:29.409]  Absolutely.
[03:10:29.409 --> 03:10:46.882]  David, in the time we've got left, I want to move through a lot of the current things that are unfolding and happening, but since you mentioned this, in the 1960s, there was an episode, Day of the Dove, in Star Trek, where an energy-sucking vampire has come on board interdimensionally on the ship, and it's playing
[03:10:47.774 --> 03:10:55.564]  The Klingons off against the humans, and the humans off against each other, and as soon as they figure that out, and become positive and loving, it dissipates it and makes it go away.
[03:10:55.564 --> 03:10:57.186]  Let's play a clip from Day of the Dove.
[03:11:18.780 --> 03:11:19.320]  What is it?
[03:11:19.320 --> 03:11:23.925]  Totally unfamiliar.
[03:11:23.925 --> 03:11:32.112]  What did you want?
[03:11:32.112 --> 03:11:35.995]  What are you doing here?
[03:11:35.995 --> 03:11:40.539]  Reporting for duty, sir.
[03:11:40.539 --> 03:11:40.759]  Duty?
[03:11:40.759 --> 03:11:41.900]  Did McCoy release you from sickbay?
[03:11:41.900 --> 03:11:43.141]  I released myself.
[03:11:43.141 --> 03:11:44.142]  Then get back to sickbay.
[03:11:44.142 --> 03:11:44.923]  Now in your life, sir.
[03:11:44.923 --> 03:11:45.884]  I'm fit and ready for action.
[03:11:47.807 --> 03:12:08.201]  And so then they figure out that it's manipulating their emotions.
[03:12:08.201 --> 03:12:16.327]  During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy level increased
[03:12:17.372 --> 03:12:22.076]  When the lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy.
[03:12:22.076 --> 03:12:25.918]  It subsists on the emotions of others.
[03:12:25.918 --> 03:12:31.423]  This one appears to be strengthened by mental radiations of hostility.
[03:12:31.423 --> 03:12:34.965]  Violent intentions.
[03:12:34.965 --> 03:12:39.989]  It exists on the hate of others.
[03:12:39.989 --> 03:12:41.870]  To put it simply.
[03:12:41.870 --> 03:12:44.913]  And it has acted as a catalyst, creating the situation.
[03:12:45.735 --> 03:12:56.421]  In order to satisfy that need, it has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments, in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict.
[03:12:56.421 --> 03:13:04.425]  And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence.
[03:13:04.425 --> 03:13:08.247]  It's got to have a vulnerable area.
[03:13:08.247 --> 03:13:09.048]  We've got to get rid of it.
[03:13:09.790 --> 03:13:13.051]  Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated.
[03:13:13.051 --> 03:13:15.111]  The fighting must end.
[03:13:15.111 --> 03:13:15.951]  And soon.
[03:13:15.951 --> 03:13:17.932]  We're a doomed ship.
[03:13:17.932 --> 03:13:19.652]  Traveling forever between galaxies.
[03:13:19.652 --> 03:13:22.072]  Filled with eternal bloodlust.
[03:13:22.072 --> 03:13:23.033]  Eternal warfare.
[03:13:23.033 --> 03:13:27.434]  Kang has got to listen.
[03:13:27.434 --> 03:13:34.355]  We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing.
[03:13:34.355 --> 03:13:39.476]  It's almost over.
[03:13:43.985 --> 03:13:45.506]  Lieutenant at will.
[03:13:45.506 --> 03:13:46.407]  Yes, Captain.
[03:13:46.407 --> 03:13:47.748]  Put me on shipwide intercom.
[03:13:47.748 --> 03:13:50.390]  Aye, sir.
[03:13:50.390 --> 03:13:54.153]  Ready, Captain.
[03:13:54.153 --> 03:13:55.974]  This is Captain Kirk.
[03:13:55.974 --> 03:13:57.395]  A truce is ordered.
[03:13:57.395 --> 03:13:59.077]  The fighting is over.
[03:13:59.077 --> 03:14:05.862]  Lay down your weapons.
[03:14:05.862 --> 03:14:08.324]  Mrs. Kang.
[03:14:08.324 --> 03:14:11.266]  Cease hostilities.
[03:14:11.266 --> 03:14:11.727]  Disarm.
[03:14:22.014 --> 03:14:34.298]  The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain, and I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon.
[03:14:34.298 --> 03:14:41.120]  Get off my ship!
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:46.821]  You're a dead duck here, you're powerless, we know about you, and we don't want to play.
[03:14:46.821 --> 03:14:48.362]  Maybe...
[03:14:50.453 --> 03:14:57.217]  Maybe there are others like you around, maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over.
[03:14:57.217 --> 03:15:02.941]  We'll be on guard now, we'll be ready for you, so ship out!
[03:15:02.941 --> 03:15:06.904]  Come on, haul it!
[03:15:06.904 --> 03:15:09.145]  Out already!
[03:15:09.145 --> 03:15:10.386]  Out!
[03:15:10.386 --> 03:15:13.528]  We need no urging to hate humans.
[03:15:13.528 --> 03:15:17.110]  For the present, only a fool fights in a burning house.
[03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.591]  Out!
[03:15:24.048 --> 03:15:29.893]  All right, so that's a little long clip, but they knew what they were doing when they wrote that back in the late 1960s.
[03:15:29.893 --> 03:15:31.995]  David Icke, your take on that?
[03:15:31.995 --> 03:15:33.897]  Well, I thought that was fantastic, mate.
[03:15:33.897 --> 03:15:38.841]  I mean, it just encapsulated, you know, what I've just been saying.
[03:15:38.841 --> 03:15:39.962]  And this is the thing.
[03:15:39.962 --> 03:15:49.190]  They don't care what we fight about, what we hate each other about, and what we abuse each other about.
[03:15:49.190 --> 03:15:51.392]  What they care about is that we do all those things.
[03:15:57.492 --> 03:16:02.374]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[03:16:02.374 --> 03:16:08.777]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:16:08.777 --> 03:16:13.899]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:16:13.899 --> 03:16:15.620]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:16:15.620 --> 03:16:22.043]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real reason we've had the success.
[03:16:22.763 --> 03:16:28.188]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[03:16:28.188 --> 03:16:32.511]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:16:32.511 --> 03:16:41.759]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:16:41.759 --> 03:16:43.100]  God bless you all.
[03:16:43.100 --> 03:16:44.141]  I salute you.
[03:16:44.141 --> 03:16:45.082]  I thank you.
[03:16:45.082 --> 03:16:50.587]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:16:51.267 --> 03:16:52.588]  The fight is my fight.
[03:16:52.588 --> 03:16:53.208]  It's your fight.
[03:16:53.208 --> 03:16:53.968]  It's our fight.
[03:16:53.968 --> 03:16:56.169]  God bless you all.
[03:16:56.169 --> 03:17:01.010]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[03:17:01.010 --> 03:17:07.573]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[03:17:07.573 --> 03:17:08.793]  This family that is InfoWars.
[03:17:10.615 --> 03:17:26.823]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[03:17:26.823 --> 03:17:35.908]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[03:17:37.228 --> 03:17:38.910]  I don't take the credit.
[03:17:38.910 --> 03:17:40.632]  I give you the credit.
[03:17:40.632 --> 03:17:43.255]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[03:17:43.255 --> 03:17:44.857]  It isn't going to give up.
[03:17:44.857 --> 03:17:46.699]  Without your support, we could be shut down.
[03:17:46.699 --> 03:17:49.983]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today.

[03:17:56.246 --> 03:17:58.609]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[03:17:58.609 --> 03:18:00.210]  It's the bad halogen.
[03:18:00.210 --> 03:18:04.054]  To the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[03:18:04.054 --> 03:18:05.736]  What's the good halogen?
[03:18:05.736 --> 03:18:08.539]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[03:19:39.827 --> 03:19:41.848]  It takes about two weeks to kick in.
[03:19:41.848 --> 03:19:43.850]  An aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes.
[03:19:43.850 --> 03:19:45.431]  Tylenol kicks in in 30 minutes.
[03:19:45.431 --> 03:19:48.133]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[03:19:48.133 --> 03:19:49.934]  You need to experience it.
[03:19:49.934 --> 03:19:50.414]  Don't wait.
[03:19:51.235 --> 03:19:52.376]  You'll be impressed.
[03:19:52.376 --> 03:19:53.916]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:19:53.916 --> 03:19:56.678]  X3.
[03:19:56.678 --> 03:20:07.323]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:07.323 --> 03:20:12.405]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:14.861 --> 03:20:17.304]  They're not bothered at why, as long as we do them.
[03:20:17.304 --> 03:20:21.550]  And notice the point is made that it equalizes the forces to keep it going forever.
[03:20:21.550 --> 03:20:22.632]  It's an energy transference.
[03:20:23.371 --> 03:20:28.392]  Yeah, well, this is a point I've made in the books over the years.
[03:20:28.392 --> 03:20:31.893]  This is why I say we don't need to fight.
[03:20:31.893 --> 03:20:35.394]  The last thing we do is fight this force.
[03:20:35.394 --> 03:20:38.255]  What we do is cease to cooperate with it.
[03:20:38.255 --> 03:20:42.616]  And one way we cooperate with it is the fight.
[03:20:42.616 --> 03:20:51.618]  So if you've got an electrical circuit, you need two polarities, and the electrical charge goes between them.
[03:20:52.452 --> 03:21:10.120]  So when you refuse to take part, then that force which wants to set up an electrical interaction with you, so it vampires your energy, suddenly it's one hand clapping.
[03:21:10.120 --> 03:21:14.302]  It's got no way of setting up that connection because you're not having it.
[03:21:15.091 --> 03:21:16.952]  You don't want to fight it.
[03:21:16.952 --> 03:21:19.294]  What you want to do is cease to cooperate with it.
[03:21:19.294 --> 03:21:25.137]  And that's why the power of no is so fundamental.
[03:21:25.137 --> 03:21:28.419]  The power of no has ended every tyranny in history.
[03:21:28.419 --> 03:21:29.540]  The power of no says
[03:21:30.612 --> 03:21:33.455]  I can see what you're doing.
[03:21:33.455 --> 03:21:35.657]  I can see why you're doing it.
[03:21:35.657 --> 03:21:38.040]  And I'm not playing your game.
[03:21:38.040 --> 03:21:40.242]  I'm not being a pawn in your game.
[03:21:40.242 --> 03:21:41.483]  I'm not having it.
[03:21:41.483 --> 03:21:47.509]  So if you look at the COVID period, if people had said no,
[03:21:49.002 --> 03:21:51.124]  David, I want to go there and talk about
[03:22:02.478 --> 03:22:07.822]  The fact that people did submit in Australia and the UK and the US to some extent, but they woke up, now the pendulum's swinging back.
[03:22:07.822 --> 03:22:13.705]  1% of who was taking the Pfizer-Moderna shots, according to a study that came out last month, are taking it now.
[03:22:13.705 --> 03:22:15.767]  So people are really rejecting it en masse.
[03:22:15.767 --> 03:22:17.368]  It takes people a while.
[03:22:17.368 --> 03:22:19.689]  Yes, you're vindicated, I'm vindicated, our viewers and listeners are.
[03:22:19.689 --> 03:22:23.712]  Those rallies you have with hundreds of thousands, the rallies Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[03:22:23.712 --> 03:22:28.515]  had with millions, I see this as an awakening, but you're right, now they're coming for the kids.
[03:22:28.515 --> 03:22:30.016]  I want to speak to that, but since you talk about
[03:22:31.027 --> 03:22:33.610]  How they're manipulating us and taking off our energy.
[03:22:33.610 --> 03:22:42.602]  Here's Julian Assange, now many years ago, before he got arrested or put on house arrest, explaining the goal of these wars, like Vietnam or Ukraine, is to be endless.
[03:22:42.602 --> 03:22:42.943]  Here it is.
[03:22:44.861 --> 03:22:49.243]  Because the goal is not to completely subjugate Afghanistan.
[03:22:49.243 --> 03:23:04.208]  The goal is to use Afghanistan to wash money out of the tax bases of the United States, out of the tax bases of European countries, through Afghanistan, and back into the hands of a transnational security alliance.
[03:23:04.208 --> 03:23:06.449]  That is the goal, i.e.
[03:23:06.449 --> 03:23:10.751]  the goal is to have an endless war, not a successful war.
[03:23:11.792 --> 03:23:13.033]  But it's bigger than that.
[03:23:13.033 --> 03:23:14.653]  It's energetic at the end of the day.
[03:23:14.653 --> 03:23:19.176]  So, David, spend a few minutes just on the temporal level of this dimension for us.
[03:23:19.176 --> 03:23:31.242]  We know you're really teaching us a lot here, but specifically the last two and a half years of hell, the euthanizing people here and in your country, the lockdowns, the police dogs, the people being put in jail, the quarantines.
[03:23:31.722 --> 03:23:34.384]  That helped build their emergency infrastructure that's still there.
[03:23:34.384 --> 03:23:36.025]  We know they're going to come back soon.
[03:23:36.025 --> 03:23:37.306]  I want your take on how that happens.
[03:23:37.306 --> 03:23:43.770]  But it does look like they wanted to keep lockdowns going longer, control longer, and that there was a massive rejection.
[03:23:43.770 --> 03:23:52.016]  So when they saw the crescendo of resistance building that would have been a chain reaction to take us over the top, they backed off at least for a little while.
[03:23:52.016 --> 03:23:53.497]  So your description of
[03:23:54.224 --> 03:23:57.485]  Well, what they're doing, Alex, is going through their agenda for the human body.
[03:23:57.485 --> 03:23:58.606]  Like I said, it's an anti-human agenda.
[03:24:24.682 --> 03:24:36.072]  And they're moving from human 1.0, the biological body as we call it, to human 2.0, which is a far more synthetic body.
[03:24:36.072 --> 03:24:39.615]  And this was described by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World.
[03:24:39.615 --> 03:24:41.296]  And this new human
[03:24:43.041 --> 03:24:44.802]  is not meant to procreate.
[03:24:44.802 --> 03:25:04.649]  It's meant to be produced technologically, which is what Huxley was talking about in World State Hatcheries, and he said that with the World State Hatcheries and the production of the human species via technology, that would be the end of parenthood.
[03:25:04.649 --> 03:25:09.271]  So from that comes an enormous number of dots to connect.
[03:25:10.106 --> 03:25:11.747]  First of all, the end of parenthood.
[03:25:11.747 --> 03:25:28.919]  That's why in Europe and America, Canada and so on, you're seeing the influence and ability to make decisions by parents about their children being completely and utterly erased.
[03:25:28.919 --> 03:25:30.440]  Why are they doing that?
[03:25:31.104 --> 03:25:37.334]  Because they're preparing for this no parent society.
[03:25:37.334 --> 03:25:43.785]  Now, if you don't need parents to procreate, you don't need men and you don't need women.
[03:25:44.554 --> 03:25:58.501]  And so we had the toxic masculinity agenda, where men started to be and continue to be abused and marginalized and attacked.
[03:25:58.501 --> 03:26:09.186]  And I said when that started, Alex, they're coming for the women next, because they don't need men and women in this brave new world of the human 2.0 to procreate.
[03:26:09.186 --> 03:26:09.986]  And so
[03:26:12.873 --> 03:26:14.814]  They're now going for the women.
[03:26:14.814 --> 03:26:25.641]  And the dominant force now in the hierarchy of political correctness is transgender.
[03:26:25.641 --> 03:26:28.283]  So where does transgender come from?
[03:26:28.283 --> 03:26:32.005]  Why did it come out of nowhere and it was suddenly everywhere?
[03:26:32.005 --> 03:26:40.631]  Why are they targeting the children in this extraordinarily extreme, blatant, in-your-face manner with the drag queens and so on?
[03:26:41.536 --> 03:26:58.046]  They're doing it because on the road to fusing gender, because this new human is meant not to be male or female, there's no need for it to be because you are not procreating anymore.
[03:26:58.046 --> 03:27:03.849]  You have to, on the way to fusing gender, you have to confuse gender.
[03:27:03.849 --> 03:27:08.292]  You have to take out the basics in the perception of the population
[03:27:09.506 --> 03:27:11.807]  of what gender is.
[03:27:11.807 --> 03:27:12.968]  Not male, female.
[03:27:12.968 --> 03:27:15.930]  You have to scramble that whole perception.
[03:27:15.930 --> 03:27:32.700]  And they are doing these horrific things to children, both perceptually and literally, with the surgery and the drugs and the castration of young kids, on the road to totally scrambling the perception of gender on the road to the no-gender human.
[03:27:32.700 --> 03:27:36.262]  And the no-gender human, as Huxley described,
[03:27:37.023 --> 03:27:52.254]  Would be produced in casts, and these casts would be genetic casts, actually synthetic genetic casts, which would have different abilities.
[03:27:52.254 --> 03:27:54.235]  We come back to what we're talking about earlier.
[03:27:54.235 --> 03:28:02.761]  They'd have different abilities to process information into a perception, into a conclusion, into a action or behavior.
[03:28:02.761 --> 03:28:04.282]  So the worker cast
[03:28:05.262 --> 03:28:17.790]  would be unable to process information, thus understand any information beyond their ability to serve as the worker caste.
[03:28:17.790 --> 03:28:19.412]  And to back you up, Huxley wrote that in 31.
[03:28:19.412 --> 03:28:23.334]  His brother was a head transhumanist, ran the UN.
[03:28:23.334 --> 03:28:28.237]  He said in a speech in 61 and his book Brave New World Revisited, that this was an actual plan of the elites.
[03:28:28.237 --> 03:28:33.321]  And as you know, he was part of that British breeding program, eugenics program himself.
[03:28:34.659 --> 03:28:55.875]  Yeah, I mean, his brother was a eugenicist, I mean, quite obviously, and of course he would be involved in the UN, which is a front for this cult to justify and to stepping stone towards total global control.
[03:28:55.875 --> 03:28:56.856]  By the will of God,
[03:28:58.089 --> 03:29:07.558]  And by God working through you and your support, InfoWars continues to persevere against attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent media.

[03:29:16.866 --> 03:29:21.290]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[03:29:21.290 --> 03:29:22.571]  And I need your support.

[03:32:56.729 --> 03:33:02.612]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.059 --> 03:33:17.220]  Big Brother.
[03:33:17.220 --> 03:33:18.281]  Mainstream media.
[03:33:18.281 --> 03:33:20.743]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:20.743 --> 03:33:22.585]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:22.585 --> 03:33:24.326]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:24.326 --> 03:33:26.508]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:33:26.508 --> 03:33:29.090]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[03:33:29.090 --> 03:33:30.632]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:32.277 --> 03:33:37.001]  So these really are just human-alien collaborators with a center-dimensional force.
[03:33:37.001 --> 03:33:38.882]  I mean, the Bible tells us that everything.
[03:33:38.882 --> 03:33:39.543]  This is really it.
[03:33:39.543 --> 03:33:41.905]  They're building a post-human world, building a nightmare.
[03:33:41.905 --> 03:33:43.266]  They see us as lab rats, David.
[03:33:43.266 --> 03:33:45.027]  You've been vindicated.
[03:33:45.027 --> 03:33:58.918]  Well, again, what I find interesting, or what I found interesting over the years as I've researched this, Alex, is that, you know, we look at the different religions and so on, and what strikes me is not
[03:34:01.285 --> 03:34:07.468]  How the religions differ from each other, but actually the common themes.
[03:34:07.468 --> 03:34:11.249]  So I looked at the Christian belief in demons.
[03:34:11.249 --> 03:34:17.832]  I looked at the whole, you know, demonic realm as Christians describe it.
[03:34:17.832 --> 03:34:19.913]  I looked at Islam and the jinn.
[03:34:19.913 --> 03:34:20.893]  What are the jinn?
[03:34:20.893 --> 03:34:25.195]  They're entities that operate outside of human sight, manipulating human society.
[03:34:25.868 --> 03:34:39.560]  I looked at the Gnostics, which were kind of vaguely a form of Christianity in theme, if not detail, and they talked about archons in the writings that they left.
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:47.608]  There was one amazing group of writings by Gnostics that were found in an earthen jar in Egypt.
[03:34:47.608 --> 03:34:51.051]  These were mystic Christians that formed the basis of the Renaissance?
[03:34:51.770 --> 03:34:59.895]  Yeah, and they left these writings, very substantial writings, in an earthen jar.
[03:34:59.895 --> 03:35:08.721]  It's estimated that they were hidden away about 75 miles north of Luxor in Egypt, a place called Nag Hammadi, about 400 AD.
[03:35:11.074 --> 03:35:18.919]  And about a fifth of these writings, after they were found in 1945, were found to be about these Archons.
[03:35:18.919 --> 03:35:21.120]  Now, well, hold on a second.
[03:35:21.120 --> 03:35:22.501]  What do they say?
[03:35:22.501 --> 03:35:28.224]  They called them Archons because Archon is a Greek word meaning rulers.
[03:35:28.224 --> 03:35:38.850]  They said that these Archons created what we call the physical world, and that this was a bad copy of
[03:35:40.737 --> 03:35:42.961]  Prime reality.
[03:35:42.961 --> 03:35:51.157]  They also talked about the fact that the great ability of these Archons was
[03:35:53.530 --> 03:36:11.318]  Virtual reality, in the translation what we would call today virtual reality, the ability to manipulate and generate illusions that made people believe they were somewhere was not anything like where they thought they were or what they thought it was.
[03:36:11.318 --> 03:36:12.439]  And then you go to the
[03:36:13.456 --> 03:36:36.721]  The Zulus in South Africa, they have the concept of the Chittahuri, and wherever you go, I've talked to aboriginals in Australia as I've traveled around the world, and you see these common, common themes of entities operating outside of human sight, which is not saying much given how narrow human sight is.
[03:36:36.721 --> 03:36:39.382]  And they're always trying to drag us into their dimension.
[03:36:40.737 --> 03:36:51.405]  Yeah, see, if we could think of mind, say fourth dimension or astral dimension is the dimension of mind, okay?
[03:36:51.405 --> 03:37:09.297]  Now you can be at the higher levels of it and see things and understand things with your mind that people in these lower levels of the astral dimension where these entities are cannot see.
[03:37:11.473 --> 03:37:18.566]  You're much more expansive in your understanding, in your ability to see the greater picture.
[03:37:18.566 --> 03:37:23.014]  You go beyond that too, way beyond that, but you're seeing a much bigger picture.
[03:37:24.135 --> 03:37:42.340]  Whereas in the lower dimensions of this, lower levels of this astral dimension, this is where these entities are, what are called Archons and Demons and all these different names for the same entities, the gods, as the ancients would perceive them.
[03:37:43.243 --> 03:37:49.552]  And so they are dominating that area of this astral dimension.
[03:37:49.552 --> 03:37:58.184]  So they want your mind, the frequency of your mind, thoughts, perceptions to be in that level.
[03:37:58.932 --> 03:38:01.834]  Of the astral dimension where they dominate.
[03:38:01.834 --> 03:38:10.198]  That's why they're trying to pull us into these low frequency states of mind and of emotion.
[03:38:10.198 --> 03:38:13.260]  And David, I want to get your take on how people can break out of that.
[03:38:13.260 --> 03:38:14.200]  But I want to play this clip.
[03:38:14.200 --> 03:38:18.383]  You talk about Stockholm Syndrome in your previous books and how they mind control people.
[03:38:18.383 --> 03:38:24.666]  This is Jennifer Gibson, well-known actress, who took one of the poison shots and now has Bell's palsy.
[03:38:24.666 --> 03:38:26.247]  She says she'd do it again.
[03:38:26.247 --> 03:38:27.868]  And I find one of the prime
[03:38:28.608 --> 03:38:35.671]  Things that these people that are under this control Basically want to destroy themselves and and don't care that they're being hurt by the system.
[03:38:35.671 --> 03:38:37.992]  How would we break somebody?
[03:38:37.992 --> 03:38:39.893]  Or how could she break herself out?
[03:38:39.893 --> 03:38:41.894]  Jennifer Gibson out of these things grasp.
[03:38:41.894 --> 03:38:42.354]  Here's a clip.
[03:38:44.161 --> 03:39:03.451]  Well, this is not a video I want to make, and it's kind of hard to make because as I'm watching myself, I see what I'm going to say, which is I have been diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, which is paralysis on one side of the face.
[03:39:03.451 --> 03:39:06.493]  For me, it's this side here, obviously.
[03:39:09.625 --> 03:39:15.710]  So I got it about two weeks after getting my vaccine, and I had a rough go with the vaccine.
[03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:18.932]  And I guess still am.
[03:39:18.932 --> 03:39:27.819]  But I have to say that I would do it again because it's what we have to do to see people.
[03:39:27.819 --> 03:39:32.883]  So I don't know why I'm making this video, but here's my word smile.
[03:39:34.395 --> 03:39:35.895]  It's what we have to do to save people.
[03:39:35.895 --> 03:39:37.516]  She believes she's a hero.
[03:39:37.516 --> 03:39:39.796]  Can't look at the statistics, can't know the facts for herself.
[03:39:39.796 --> 03:39:42.237]  What is going on with this woman, David Icke?
[03:39:42.237 --> 03:39:50.239]  Well, you see, what you've got here, and we can talk about the fake vaccine as well, and its effect on the psyche of people.
[03:39:50.239 --> 03:39:56.920]  I mean, the number of people, I mean, we all interact with people, we both interact with people a lot, and we both read a lot.
[03:39:56.920 --> 03:40:02.462]  Almost everyone I know that's taken it has less energy, is sick now, and acts more zombie-like.
[03:40:02.462 --> 03:40:03.022]  It's very sad.
[03:40:03.757 --> 03:40:18.444]  Well, I'll tell you the word, Alex, that I've heard so many times in relation to people who've had loved ones or people who they work with who've had the fake vaccine when they haven't.
[03:40:18.444 --> 03:40:20.045]  It is vacant.
[03:40:20.045 --> 03:40:22.186]  These people are vacant.
[03:40:22.186 --> 03:40:27.809]  And it's basically, we have what people call assault.
[03:40:28.695 --> 03:40:34.159]  Which is experiencing this reality through the human body.
[03:40:34.159 --> 03:40:41.045]  And that soul is supposed to connect out into the great beyond and the great expansion of awareness, insight, knowledge, all that stuff.
[03:40:41.045 --> 03:40:48.391]  The idea of these fake vaccines, one level of them, there are many reasons for them, is to break that connection.
[03:40:48.391 --> 03:40:54.856]  So that basically, if I'm sitting here in front of a computer and I'm the soul,
[03:40:56.178 --> 03:40:58.360]  I'm interacting with the computer.
[03:40:58.360 --> 03:40:59.301]  I've got the mouse.
[03:40:59.301 --> 03:41:00.502]  I've got the keyboard.
[03:41:00.502 --> 03:41:02.884]  I'm interacting with it.
[03:41:02.884 --> 03:41:12.073]  But when you get a computer virus, which is essentially in theme is what these fake vaccines are doing.
[03:41:13.340 --> 03:41:27.609]  That computer virus takes over the operating system and it disconnects the interaction between me, symbolic of soul, and the operating system, symbolic of the body.
[03:41:27.609 --> 03:41:37.795]  So now the five sense level of the person is running the show and it's been literally possessed by
[03:41:39.221 --> 03:41:46.242]  By another force, by being disconnected from its source, what we call the soul.
[03:41:46.242 --> 03:41:51.403]  So with this lady, something has happened physically.
[03:41:51.403 --> 03:41:55.424]  It's happened in the five sense realm of her life.
[03:41:55.424 --> 03:41:59.925]  Therefore, she cannot ignore it.
[03:41:59.925 --> 03:42:01.265]  She can't ignore it.
[03:42:01.265 --> 03:42:03.685]  Her five senses are seeing it.
[03:42:03.685 --> 03:42:05.426]  They're experiencing it.
[03:42:05.426 --> 03:42:07.826]  So that level can't be hidden from her.
[03:42:08.346 --> 03:42:16.189]  But what can be manipulated is her response to it, which comes from perception.
[03:42:16.189 --> 03:42:23.451]  And her perception is that even though I can't ignore it, look at it, what this fake vaccine has done to me,
[03:42:25.154 --> 03:42:34.236]  My response is still, well, I'd have it again, which is insane, but that's the way the program works.
[03:42:34.236 --> 03:42:49.180]  Now, if you were connected to what people call soul, if your mind was more expansive, as with all the people who have not had the fake facts, they would say, bloody hell, have you seen what this thing's done to me?
[03:42:49.180 --> 03:42:51.241]  Of course I'd never have it again.
[03:42:56.485 --> 03:42:58.326]  It's our best seller.
[03:42:58.326 --> 03:43:02.087]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[03:43:02.087 --> 03:43:11.169]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.

[03:46:00.303 --> 03:46:04.167]  To the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[03:46:04.167 --> 03:46:05.848]  What's the good halogen?
[03:46:05.848 --> 03:46:08.651]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[03:46:56.915 --> 03:47:02.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.225 --> 03:47:19.509]  That's what you would say if you had any kind of expansive mind, but these people do not.
[03:47:19.509 --> 03:47:27.253]  And therefore they cannot, coming back to what I said earlier, Alex, they literally cannot process the information.
[03:47:27.253 --> 03:47:27.813]  Absolutely.
[03:47:27.813 --> 03:47:29.914]  So how do you get her out of the trance?
[03:47:29.914 --> 03:47:34.577]  How do you... I mean, how do we help these people, or are they just lost causes?
[03:47:37.148 --> 03:47:44.813]  Well, as I say earlier in our chat, everything is mind.
[03:47:44.813 --> 03:47:46.754]  Everything is mind.
[03:47:46.754 --> 03:47:58.102]  This force is manipulating mind to perceive and conclude in a way that suits its agenda.
[03:47:58.102 --> 03:48:04.046]  But mind, consciousness beyond mind into the great beyond, what people call spirit,
[03:48:04.955 --> 03:48:09.018]  is capable of overriding that.
[03:48:09.018 --> 03:48:17.684]  You know, I've said in The Trap that the mind is not in the body.
[03:48:17.684 --> 03:48:21.026]  The body is in the mind.
[03:48:21.026 --> 03:48:27.931]  Mind is generating or decoding the information into what we call the body.
[03:48:28.917 --> 03:48:53.588]  Now, once the mind is manipulated to believe it's in the body, and the body systems are the dominant force in the relationship, then when a doctor says to someone, you've got five months to live, if you look at the statistics, you'll see that the doctor's prognosis for life
[03:48:55.077 --> 03:49:00.941]  Turns out to be overwhelmingly the period that people live before they die.
[03:49:00.941 --> 03:49:03.763]  Now, is that because doctors are so clever?
[03:49:03.763 --> 03:49:06.944]  No, no, are you bloody kidding?
[03:49:06.944 --> 03:49:10.447]  It's because the mind takes on the belief
[03:49:11.610 --> 03:49:11.910]  That's
[03:49:28.925 --> 03:49:41.572]  Philosopher, not as a best-selling author, not as a researcher, not as a trailblazer or a maverick, but just as a man, if she was saying this to you, how is there any tricks to get her to realize she can override the control, she can get back in control?
[03:49:41.572 --> 03:49:42.473]  Like, look at you!
[03:49:42.473 --> 03:49:45.495]  I mean, what have they done to you, sweetheart?
[03:49:45.495 --> 03:49:49.197]  Do you give her statistics, or is there some way to get her out of the Stockholm Syndrome?
[03:49:51.129 --> 03:50:01.872]  Well, in the end, you know, it's information that creates the program, that programs people into that state of mind.
[03:50:01.872 --> 03:50:05.132]  And therefore, it's information that can deprogram.
[03:50:05.132 --> 03:50:09.414]  So people need to flood her Twitter and Instagram with this interview today.
[03:50:09.414 --> 03:50:13.334]  She needs outreach.
[03:50:13.334 --> 03:50:19.496]  Yeah, what I would say to her is, first of all, look at this level.
[03:50:20.476 --> 03:50:30.837]  And look at the fact that you've taken a fake vaccine, which is not a vaccine by any previous criteria, and you've got into this state.
[03:50:31.920 --> 03:50:39.403]  Now, why would you then say you'd have it again, given what it's done to you?
[03:50:39.403 --> 03:50:56.610]  I would then show her all the other people across the world, just going by the VAERS system in America and the yellow card system of reporting in Britain, which is only between 1% and 10% maximum, of their actual deaths and adverse effects.
[03:50:57.370 --> 03:51:13.654]  And I would point out that the consequences, not just for her, it's not just the one-off, are absolutely massive, both in deaths and in destroyed health long-term and reduced life expectancy.
[03:51:14.602 --> 03:51:23.911]  And then I'd ask her if she really believed that someone who would promote that had the best interests of humanity at heart.
[03:51:23.911 --> 03:51:31.237]  I would show her all the kids figures who died by having this fake vaccine.
[03:51:31.237 --> 03:51:35.762]  Because the question comes, why do they want to give this fake vaccine and it's
[03:51:37.845 --> 03:51:49.652]  The ones that follow, to every man, woman and child on the planet, because they want every man, woman and child on the planet connected to the cloud and controlled by AI so they don't even have to manipulate perception anymore.
[03:51:49.652 --> 03:51:50.853]  It comes direct from AI.
[03:51:50.853 --> 03:51:53.815]  That's the whole point.
[03:51:53.815 --> 03:51:58.378]  And then I would start to ask, who do you think you are?
[03:51:58.378 --> 03:51:59.778]  Do you think you're just that body?
[03:51:59.778 --> 03:52:03.741]  And I go deeper into the nature of reality.
[03:52:03.741 --> 03:52:06.442]  And the only way you can
[03:52:07.865 --> 03:52:21.484]  You can get people out of the program is for them to expand their minds into greatest ways of consciousness beyond the program and this is what Alex we call awakening.
[03:52:22.579 --> 03:52:23.959]  What is awakening?
[03:52:23.959 --> 03:52:32.962]  It's awakening from the five-sense prison, the five-sense focus of attention, because that's what it is.
[03:52:32.962 --> 03:52:45.065]  The whole process of human control is a focusing attention on the smallest myopia of possibility, of self-identity, of reality.
[03:52:45.065 --> 03:52:48.326]  And so if people can
[03:52:49.898 --> 03:52:52.199]  Start to ask questions.
[03:52:52.199 --> 03:52:54.019]  That's the process.
[03:52:54.019 --> 03:52:57.540]  Asking questions of what they've been told.
[03:52:57.540 --> 03:53:03.862]  And they'll realize, if they do any research at all, or read other people's research, they'll see that what they're told overwhelmingly is not true.
[03:53:07.643 --> 03:53:08.665]  Lies!
[03:53:08.665 --> 03:53:21.360]  So when authority tells you something, whether it's a fake vaccine or the reason for a war, what you say is, okay, on the basis of the entirety of known human history, authority lies.
[03:53:21.360 --> 03:53:26.406]  So I'm going to start on the basis that what you're telling me is a bloody lie, like the
[03:53:26.926 --> 03:53:27.906]  Thank you very much.
[03:53:48.575 --> 03:53:59.600]  Once you start that process, what are the other possibilities of what is happening, or other possibilities of the reality I'm experiencing?
[03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:02.822]  That questioning starts to open your mind!
[03:54:02.822 --> 03:54:03.242]  Beautiful.
[03:54:03.242 --> 03:54:06.624]  And you start to see things you couldn't see before.
[03:54:06.624 --> 03:54:15.308]  And there's a real process, and so many people watching this program, this chat, will have gone through this, otherwise they wouldn't be watching this.
[03:54:16.518 --> 03:54:27.667]  There's this process known as synchronicity, which Jung talked about, the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.
[03:54:27.667 --> 03:54:34.432]  Synchronicity, where things just happen and you think, what's the chances of that?
[03:54:34.432 --> 03:54:35.873]  What a coincidence!
[03:54:35.873 --> 03:54:37.835]  Blimey, how did that happen?
[03:54:37.835 --> 03:54:40.056]  And what it is, is this.
[03:54:40.056 --> 03:54:44.740]  When you are operating on a certain perceptual state,
[03:54:46.104 --> 03:55:04.357]  That frequency that's going out, that is a frequency reflection of the perceptual state, is pulling towards you other frequencies, other magnetic fields, called people, places, ways of life, experiences, that relate to that original perception.
[03:55:04.357 --> 03:55:11.822]  So if your perceptions are only coming from mainstream media, the mainstream everything,
[03:55:12.719 --> 03:55:23.224]  Then what you will do will experience things that seem to confirm that what you're told by the mainstream everything is true because that's all you're experiencing.
[03:55:23.982 --> 03:55:29.563]  But when you start to open your mind and say, well, hold on, what's some other explanations for this?
[03:55:29.563 --> 03:55:32.403]  What's the other possible explanation for this?
[03:55:32.403 --> 03:55:39.445]  That changes the frequency you're putting out because you're expanding, opening your mind to ask those questions.
[03:55:39.445 --> 03:55:51.447]  And what then happens is you start attracting to you, and it's a frequency attraction of electromagnetic fields on this level, people, places, ways of life, experiences, coincidences.
[03:55:56.102 --> 03:56:00.864]  And it's the end of this special Friday broadcast.
[03:56:00.864 --> 03:56:06.285]  If you missed any of the Adam Curry interview or the incredible David Icke interview as well, both were amazing.
[03:56:06.285 --> 03:56:11.947]  We're posting them all commercial-free up on Band.Video.
[03:56:11.947 --> 03:56:15.368]  As we speak, I'm told we'll be up in an hour or so at Band.Video.
[03:56:15.368 --> 03:56:16.749]  But let me tell you who's coming up right now.
[03:56:16.749 --> 03:56:21.270]  The great, the intrepid, a guy that I just admire so much, so wise,
[03:56:22.100 --> 03:56:23.801]  So strong for his age.
[03:56:23.801 --> 03:56:25.482]  I mean, I can't imagine what Owen's going to be like when he's 48.
[03:56:25.482 --> 03:56:30.385]  Because I've just got better and better over the years, and Owen's about as good as I am already.
[03:56:30.385 --> 03:56:32.247]  So, Owen Schroer is about to take over.
[03:56:33.596 --> 03:56:34.277]  3 to 6 p.m.
[03:56:34.277 --> 03:56:43.764]  today at InfoWars.com forward slash show or on local stations in your area whatever you do please send out the link and promote what we're doing here also Harrison Smith weekday mornings 8 a.m.
[03:56:43.764 --> 03:56:54.573]  knocks out of the park as well InfoWars.com forward slash show thank you all for your support it's been humbling and as I said tomorrow I'm coming up here at 10 we'll probably start taping about 10 30
[03:56:55.640 --> 03:57:00.884]  You know, the weekday shows are live, Sunday shows are live too, but we do these Saturday shows taped usually, sometimes they're live.
[03:57:00.884 --> 03:57:11.491]  And we're going to do nuclear war analysis in detail and how they set up under the UN these COVID camps that are still being expanded worldwide for political dissidents.
[03:57:11.491 --> 03:57:17.075]  This is going to be as important information tomorrow's news today, so critical to all our freedom and future.
[03:57:17.075 --> 03:57:20.537]  We expose this program, we can stop it now, but they keep building it in secret.
[03:57:20.537 --> 03:57:24.100]  They're going to use it on us with worldwide martial law, probably during World War III.
[03:57:25.237 --> 03:57:27.940]  So, that's tomorrow.
[03:57:27.940 --> 03:57:28.941]  I'll put a deadline on it.
[03:57:28.941 --> 03:57:32.466]  We'll start streaming it and post it at 1 p.m.
[03:57:32.466 --> 03:57:33.727]  tomorrow.
[03:57:33.727 --> 03:57:34.067]  1 p.m.
[03:57:34.067 --> 03:57:34.748]  tomorrow.
[03:57:34.748 --> 03:57:36.851]  Special Report goes live, Man.Video.
[03:57:36.851 --> 03:57:42.557]  Special Report goes live in the streams at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:57:42.557 --> 03:57:43.558]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:43.558 --> 03:57:44.800]  God bless and good luck.
[03:57:46.277 --> 03:57:47.838]  Look around you.
[03:57:47.838 --> 03:57:52.840]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[03:57:52.840 --> 03:57:56.742]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[03:57:56.742 --> 03:58:06.087]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[03:58:06.087 --> 03:58:11.750]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:15.332]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[03:58:16.192 --> 03:58:19.296]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[03:58:19.296 --> 03:58:25.583]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[03:58:25.583 --> 03:58:26.864]  It's unsustainable.
[03:58:26.864 --> 03:58:28.085]  So please, visit.
[03:58:29.176 --> 03:58:31.159]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[03:58:31.159 --> 03:58:39.289]  SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[03:58:39.289 --> 03:58:42.273]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[03:58:42.273 --> 03:58:43.595]  Thank you for your support.
[03:58:43.595 --> 03:58:44.696]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[03:58:47.503 --> 03:58:52.387]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[03:58:52.387 --> 03:58:58.812]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:58:58.812 --> 03:59:03.936]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:59:03.936 --> 03:59:05.638]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:59:05.638 --> 03:59:12.063]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real reason we've had this success.
[03:59:12.763 --> 03:59:18.207]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[03:59:18.207 --> 03:59:22.530]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:59:22.530 --> 03:59:31.717]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:59:31.717 --> 03:59:33.118]  God bless you all.
[03:59:33.118 --> 03:59:34.159]  I salute you.
[03:59:34.159 --> 03:59:35.060]  I thank you.
[03:59:35.060 --> 03:59:40.624]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:59:41.204 --> 03:59:42.606]  The fight is my fight.
[03:59:42.606 --> 03:59:43.227]  It's your fight.
[03:59:43.227 --> 03:59:43.967]  It's our fight.
[03:59:43.967 --> 03:59:49.033]  God bless you all.
[03:59:49.033 --> 03:59:52.938]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
