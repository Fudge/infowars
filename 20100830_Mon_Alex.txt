[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:35.560]  Texas Alex Jones we're live ladies and gentlemen Monday the 30th day of August
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.920]  2010 whole Joseph Watson is going to be joining us coming up in the last hour to
[00:41.920 --> 00:46.720]  talk about a host of issues in fact here's just some of the reports we've
[00:46.720 --> 00:52.080]  got up there government think tank calls for infiltrating conspiracy theory
[00:52.080 --> 00:56.440]  websites now this is the British government it's already going on but
[00:56.440 --> 01:00.920]  this is in the London independent today how they're infiltrating to make
[01:00.920 --> 01:05.600]  anybody that criticizes the government look ridiculous and also to quote
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.880]  promote trust in the government because trust in government is imploding
[01:10.880 --> 01:14.760]  that's what these leaked government documents out of England show and of
[01:14.760 --> 01:19.680]  course it's the mirror image of Cass Sunstein in the White House here doing
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.400]  the same thing as well saying they want to work towards shutting down the free
[01:23.400 --> 01:27.040]  web but in the time being and they need to get in there and get us all in
[01:27.040 --> 01:32.120]  fighting with each other but also trusting the system so we'll be
[01:32.120 --> 01:36.960]  reporting on that also another report up on prisonplanet.com from public
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.760]  intelligence Kurt Nemo is doing his own report on this DOJ demonizes
[01:41.760 --> 01:47.400]  constitutionalist as his extremist criminals and remember a year and a
[01:47.400 --> 01:50.360]  half ago we were sent by law enforcement the Homeland Security and Mayak
[01:50.360 --> 01:55.440]  reports saying gun owners conservatives libertarians returning veterans are what
[01:55.440 --> 02:01.240]  Homeland Security is really for this is a public document expanding that
[02:01.240 --> 02:05.760]  demonization if you're against the cancer of big corrupt government run by
[02:05.760 --> 02:11.600]  the globalist you are a criminal you are an extremist you must be dealt with
[02:11.600 --> 02:15.920]  I mean if you don't want to just hand over control of your life to this system
[02:15.920 --> 02:22.960]  you're the enemy meanwhile the global engineers are also not just controlling
[02:22.960 --> 02:27.600]  the false left they're controlling the false right and they're building up
[02:27.600 --> 02:33.800]  these conservative icons that as soon as Republicans get into power in the next
[02:33.800 --> 02:38.640]  two election cycles this year and then two years after that you're going to see
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.840]  expansions of torture expansions of secret arresting expansions of the entire
[02:43.840 --> 02:48.800]  control grid just as Obama claimed he was going to end all that and as soon as
[02:48.800 --> 02:53.680]  he got in it raced forward because as soon as they get fresh birdcage liner in
[02:53.680 --> 02:58.440]  there the people are so distracted by the pretty new birdcage liner they're not
[02:58.440 --> 03:03.920]  looking at the globalist bird in the perch soiling it and so we get sick of
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.600]  George W they give us Barack Obama new birdcage liner now we're getting sick
[03:08.600 --> 03:16.040]  of him man Sarah Palin or Mitt Romney or General Petraeus or or you know top
[03:16.040 --> 03:21.600]  globalist promoting carbon taxes Newt Genrich he is going to look really great
[03:21.600 --> 03:27.400]  and they insert him in and then the whole Glenn Beckian situation will be
[03:27.400 --> 03:31.600]  discredited but they won't care they'll just sit back and wait for the liberals
[03:31.600 --> 03:36.400]  to come back in and the cycle goes on over and over and over again so we've
[03:36.400 --> 03:42.320]  got to have a discussion here about how do we end this cycle we're going to be
[03:42.320 --> 03:48.320]  discussing that today as well in the health section it's incredible news
[03:48.320 --> 03:55.160]  climate and energy the economy police state Israel Iran Middle East war on

[04:13.240 --> 04:18.200]  building him up as our messianic leader across the political spectrum that's how
[04:18.200 --> 04:23.600]  they hope to control this huge grassroots awakening that Ron Paul myself you the
[04:23.600 --> 04:29.800]  listeners and viewers really spurred and they are really pulling all all the

[07:06.440 --> 07:10.600]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[07:10.600 --> 07:14.520]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[07:14.520 --> 07:18.160]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[07:18.160 --> 07:22.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[07:22.720 --> 07:26.760]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[07:26.760 --> 07:30.560]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:30.560 --> 07:34.160]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[07:34.160 --> 07:38.520]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[07:38.520 --> 07:41.680]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[08:16.520 --> 08:19.000]  network
[08:19.000 --> 08:29.920]  thank you for joining us it is Monday the 30th day of August 2010 and I'm gonna
[08:29.920 --> 08:40.600]  go ahead and one straight in to the news dealing with the economy with health
[08:40.600 --> 08:46.600]  care with the terrorating border and globalism and so many other important
[08:46.600 --> 08:51.880]  issues in fact here's just one of the stacks of news that I have here in front
[08:51.880 --> 08:58.840]  of me this is out of the Houston Chronicle five days after there were
[08:58.840 --> 09:05.680]  reports all over South Texas of systemic election fraud in Harris County and
[09:05.680 --> 09:10.760]  calls to investigate the electronic voting machines the voting records the
[09:10.760 --> 09:15.760]  warehouse containing them went up into complete flames completely destroyed
[09:15.760 --> 09:20.480]  everything collapsed and of course the fire alarms did not work official
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.000]  scramble after fire destroys voting machines Harris County clerk is urging
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  public to cast balance early and this just happened a few days after the
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.840]  headlines ran voter fraud in Harris County Harris County officials are
[09:35.840 --> 09:40.520]  bringing allegations of major voter registration fraud against a Houston
[09:40.520 --> 09:47.720]  nonprofit but it doesn't matter because all of it has now been conveniently
[09:47.720 --> 09:58.600]  destroyed you know you you see this all over the country the only establishment
[09:58.600 --> 10:01.400]  types that have been winning are in states where there's clearly been fraud
[10:01.400 --> 10:06.760]  there's a long history of election fraud in Arizona yeah it came out that Pat
[10:06.760 --> 10:10.960]  Buchanan won in many counties during one of his presidential runs in Arizona
[10:10.960 --> 10:16.040]  but he was shown to almost get you know just a few percentage points that's the
[10:16.040 --> 10:22.480]  same thing JD Hayworth in every major poll was neck and neck or had been a
[10:22.480 --> 10:31.720]  few points ahead of John McCain but he lost by double digits lost by double
[10:31.720 --> 10:40.520]  digits and we've seen this I personally caught election fraud in 1998 and 2000 I
[10:40.520 --> 10:45.800]  went before the Election Commission at the state and county level and they
[10:45.800 --> 10:52.040]  admitted that we had found the quote giant errors but that it was all a big
[10:52.040 --> 11:00.440]  mistake by the county election officials and you'd have different members of the
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.400]  county commissioners like Karen Sun Lightner and others who'd be losing by
[11:05.400 --> 11:09.520]  many points and then suddenly she collapsed crying and her good friend
[11:09.520 --> 11:13.280]  Dana de Dubois the head election official came and hugged her and
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.840]  comforted her in the bathroom their good friends and magically she won there at
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.880]  the end of the evening you know just things like that and it just goes on and
[11:23.880 --> 11:28.040]  on I mean I've learned that you go to bed at two in the morning watching a local
[11:28.040 --> 11:32.640]  election and the Patriot candidate ten points ahead and you'll wake up and they
[11:32.640 --> 11:36.960]  lose by 20 yeah it's just just how America works I mean hell if the
[11:36.960 --> 11:40.480]  government's gonna put sodium fluoride in your water and gonna take your pension
[11:40.480 --> 11:44.040]  funds and use the pletid uranium all over the planet knowing it's gonna give
[11:44.040 --> 11:47.960]  you cancer and they've committed so many other crimes they're gonna shoot your
[11:47.960 --> 11:53.280]  kids up full of mercury filled vaccines that brain damage them if they're gonna
[11:53.280 --> 11:57.040]  take your baby's blood secretly at birth and a secret world government
[11:57.040 --> 12:04.000]  program in the last 38 years now declassified why not I mean the sky is
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.600]  the limit here so we'll be covering more of that today and I just want to make a
[12:09.600 --> 12:16.600]  small side note on this and then I'm gonna get into the major bulk of the
[12:16.600 --> 12:19.200]  news today
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.560]  about three weeks ago I happened to tune into Rush Limbaugh and we read the
[12:26.560 --> 12:33.280]  transcript here on there I went to his website and got it and he said basically
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.200]  that there is a blue blood group that runs America and they want to destroy the
[12:38.200 --> 12:41.200]  free market and they want to destroy the family and they want to destroy the
[12:41.200 --> 12:45.440]  middle class course that's all stated in government textbooks it's it's limbaugh
[12:45.440 --> 12:49.320]  didn't just discover this he's known this for a long time and that the
[12:49.320 --> 12:54.400]  Republicans and Democrats are controlled by them well then this weekend I
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.480]  happened to tune in to one of his broadcasts from the week that was
[12:58.480 --> 13:03.080]  re-airing and he was talking about the cook detector if trilateralist is going
[13:03.080 --> 13:08.200]  west at one speed and the council on farm relations is going east at another
[13:08.200 --> 13:13.200]  speed how long does it take him to conquer the world he was making jokes
[13:13.200 --> 13:18.040]  about Fidel Castro coming out and talking about the Bilderberg group and
[13:18.040 --> 13:21.720]  that shows you how important the Bilderberg group is that Glenn Beck makes
[13:21.720 --> 13:26.200]  jokes about the Bilderberg group limbaugh does it this is a group openly
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.200]  bragging that they helped establish the framework for world government
[13:31.200 --> 13:38.120]  Etinian Davengnand the Viscount the head of it has given BBC interviews he's
[13:38.120 --> 13:45.800]  given major interviews to newspapers in Europe we've covered it it's in several
[13:45.800 --> 13:52.360]  of my latest films and then their response is just to laugh it off look
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.720]  it's not funny that the IMF has officially come out with its new global
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.640]  currency that will be financed off of US taxpayer funds through carbon taxes
[14:02.640 --> 14:07.080]  that regulate and control every fastener of our life that's been public now for
[14:07.080 --> 14:13.760]  the last year they've even given it a name the the the the bandcore global
[14:13.760 --> 14:18.200]  digital currency you'll still have your national currency it'll just be set and
[14:18.200 --> 14:21.680]  denominated by this global unelected group I mean that's at the Davos
[14:21.680 --> 14:26.080]  Switzerland meetings that's in the British Parliamentary meetings that's in
[14:26.080 --> 14:31.600]  the Financial Times it's everywhere and I've got to hear this guy set up there
[14:31.600 --> 14:39.200]  and make jokes about it look I told you Ron Paul told you countless others told
[14:39.200 --> 14:44.760]  you that we're going into a depression that it's an engineered depression that
[14:44.760 --> 14:48.040]  they're going to use the Homeland Security grid against conservatives and
[14:48.040 --> 14:53.520]  libertarians and godowners and landowners now I knew this more than a decade ago
[14:53.520 --> 14:57.800]  Bill Clinton actually set up Homeland Security the first references to it are
[14:57.800 --> 15:04.480]  in 1993 the threat fusion centers all of this is designed for true Americans
[15:04.480 --> 15:08.080]  people that believe in the Declaration of Independence believe in the
[15:08.080 --> 15:15.480]  Constitution believe in the Bill of Rights and it's ridiculous it is admitted
[15:15.480 --> 15:19.280]  that a world government has been founded it is admitted that it is founded for
[15:19.280 --> 15:26.680]  the express purpose of setting up a world dictatorship as a means to an end to
[15:26.680 --> 15:33.800]  carry out forced eugenics and I'm hearing more and more of this schizophrenic talk
[15:33.800 --> 15:41.680]  out of Limbaugh and out of Glen Beck and it's a double game is what it is Beck
[15:41.680 --> 15:44.520]  admits there's a world government but then makes fun of you if you talk about
[15:44.520 --> 15:49.040]  one of the most powerful groups involved one of the bona fide organizations that
[15:49.040 --> 15:52.640]  literally tapped Obama to be president we were there at the meeting we knew
[15:52.640 --> 15:58.080]  where to be protesting pointing out Obama was in there years later it came out
[15:58.080 --> 16:05.760]  he was we've been right about it all and so we woke up the American people that
[16:05.760 --> 16:11.560]  the American people woke up others and we're now the majority and the system
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.640]  is sending in Rush Limbaugh and Glen Beck and all these other people to gate
[16:15.640 --> 16:21.920]  keep and to control the population and to keep us on the reservation so that
[16:21.920 --> 16:26.680]  we'll go out and to make sure at the critical time they can attack Ron Paul
[16:26.680 --> 16:30.880]  and make sure he doesn't get elected make sure it's a Mitt Romney or a Sarah
[16:30.880 --> 16:38.440]  Palin or a Newt Gennrich it's just that simple and so now more and more they
[16:38.440 --> 16:44.400]  will tell you about 90% of the truth but then Glenn Beck will get up and say oh
[16:44.400 --> 16:49.720]  the Mayak report the Homeland Security report well it talks about dangerous
[16:49.720 --> 16:53.440]  groups and he'll say I agree with that I disagree with this I agree with that and
[16:53.440 --> 17:00.160]  kind of well this is kind of a good law enforcement report but see I already knew
[17:00.160 --> 17:05.360]  about those reports before one of the latest ones we broke last year got so
[17:05.360 --> 17:15.560]  much attention I already had gotten the reports in 96 97 98 99 2000 2001 I'd
[17:15.560 --> 17:20.920]  gotten them from Louisiana and Arizona and Maryland and Texas over and over
[17:20.920 --> 17:28.280]  again saying the exact same stuff that was in there predating 9-11 that's how
[17:28.280 --> 17:32.160]  I knew that the whole focus was for the American people not guys wearing
[17:32.160 --> 17:38.400]  turbines that live in Central Asia who've been on the CIA ban wagon since
[17:38.400 --> 17:48.600]  their inception and so when I would see Glenn Beck go to the White House in 2008
[17:48.600 --> 17:57.320]  and 2009 2007 2008 and admittedly get marching orders from Carl Rove and
[17:57.320 --> 18:02.160]  George W. Bush and support torture and the Patriot Act and secret arrest and
[18:02.160 --> 18:06.120]  say you were a liberal commie if you were against it and then I would see him
[18:06.120 --> 18:10.600]  demonize militias and Ron Paul supporters and say they want to bomb
[18:10.600 --> 18:15.520]  buildings and their and the army needs to be used against them I'd already read
[18:15.520 --> 18:20.680]  all the Homeland Security reports I knew Glenn Beck was reading a teleprompter
[18:20.680 --> 18:26.840]  that had that information put on it it was a script and I was horrified and I'm
[18:26.840 --> 18:30.560]  gonna be honest with you I get such a bad feeling when I look at Glenn Beck he
[18:30.560 --> 18:36.040]  is so evil that I become sick it's like being in a room with a demon so I don't
[18:36.040 --> 18:42.760]  listen I don't watch and I've been wrong okay it's hard for me to look at him
[18:42.760 --> 18:47.480]  just like it's hard for me to look at Barack Obama or Bill Clinton I can read
[18:47.480 --> 18:51.760]  transcripts of what they say but to look at him it really upsets me folks
[18:51.760 --> 18:56.440]  because they're so plastic they're so funny they enjoy conning you and I've
[18:56.440 --> 19:00.160]  left Beck alone lately and just said look I'm not gonna attack him I'm not
[19:00.160 --> 19:05.440]  gonna talk about him but he's doing so much good now but I know he's Judas
[19:05.440 --> 19:12.600]  Iscariot I know he's Benedict Arnold I know who he is in my bones in my gut but
[19:12.600 --> 19:19.080]  I don't just go off that I've seen him that guy reads off a script word for
[19:19.080 --> 19:25.520]  word at key points he's there to sabotage and he's there to make the
[19:25.520 --> 19:29.040]  liberty movement look bad at the end of the day and I'm not just somebody that
[19:29.040 --> 19:36.400]  just judges people I've watched him I've studied him I mean Rush Limbaugh is so
[19:36.400 --> 19:41.600]  smart he knows this world government's real he knows it's now for years but all
[19:41.600 --> 19:46.320]  of the news as they push it and try to sell the public on it and he still sits
[19:46.320 --> 19:52.000]  there to his audience and lies to him and Glenn Beck does it and their
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.360]  mercenaries they think it's tough and cool that they're heartless and lie into

[24:00.280 --> 24:12.440]  folks I don't want to spend all day on Glenn Beck it's just that I tuned in to
[24:12.440 --> 24:20.440]  MPR I tuned in to MSNBC Fox on XM radio but I've been going to the store and
[24:20.440 --> 24:26.000]  things this weekend I turned the television on for five minutes I every
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.960]  show I've listened to all they've talked about is Glenn Beck and again it's
[24:30.960 --> 24:35.520]  very sophisticated propaganda of course it's reasonable for Glenn Beck to have
[24:35.520 --> 24:42.960]  a rally at the Lincoln Memorial and I think it's great that he had the niece
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.480]  of Martin Luther King there who's a conservative black lady and who's against
[24:47.480 --> 24:51.240]  abortion you know over half the black folks in this country aren't born they're
[24:51.240 --> 24:57.680]  killed in the womb I mean that is truly the message that needs to be gotten out
[24:57.680 --> 25:03.200]  that the fake liberal establishment wants to carry out eugenics and basically
[25:03.200 --> 25:08.520]  exterminate black people and when I spot check back when he's on in the
[25:08.520 --> 25:14.480]  break room or something here at the office I see a lot I like I see a lot
[25:14.480 --> 25:22.600]  that I appreciate but then my instinct tells me Alex this guy's bad news and
[25:22.600 --> 25:27.960]  then I remember yeah he said that oh Ron Paul's got something called a money
[25:27.960 --> 25:32.600]  bomb that means that they want to blow things up we need to use the army against
[25:32.600 --> 25:37.800]  them and we've got to worry about these domestic groups and you know he's done
[25:37.800 --> 25:42.960]  so many things like that so many creepy multi-faced things I mean take his new
[25:42.960 --> 25:47.960]  book the Overton window that's a number one New York Towns bestseller and you'd
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.680]  think I'd be flattered that if there's this character of Mr. Bailey who's a
[25:52.680 --> 26:00.240]  patriot you know YouTube type star who discovers that the government staging
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.640]  terror attacks and sacrifices himself to stop the government nuking LA to bring
[26:05.640 --> 26:11.840]  in martial law but it's creepy now we broke the Mayak report we're exposing
[26:11.840 --> 26:15.680]  government sponsored terror it's it you know that clearly I'm the hero of the
[26:15.680 --> 26:22.160]  book or an art type of myself it's just creepy that Beck says this book is
[26:22.160 --> 26:28.840]  faction it's real things are real things going on put in fiction then you read it
[26:28.840 --> 26:34.440]  and it's everything he denies the US government staging terror attacks with
[26:34.440 --> 26:39.740]  offshore globalist they want to destroy America from within by design the big
[26:39.740 --> 26:45.080]  banks are behind it basically everything that's true put in fiction
[26:45.080 --> 26:50.080]  faction and then at the end of the book Beck says by the way none of this is
[26:50.080 --> 26:54.080]  true there's no world government the government's not staging terror attacks
[26:54.080 --> 27:02.600]  this is kooky yeah this books got FEMA camp Senate but they're not real I mean
[27:02.600 --> 27:07.800]  why didn't he write a nonfiction book and then say you know this is what's
[27:07.800 --> 27:15.280]  really going on why it's so sick it everything with him I mean I want to
[27:15.280 --> 27:19.920]  save this country I have no future you have no future our children have no
[27:19.920 --> 27:24.880]  future if we don't turn things around and if Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck would
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.640]  come out all the way and tell it like it is and really expose both parties oh
[27:29.640 --> 27:34.440]  they claim both parties are bad but it's lip service it's lip service they're
[27:34.440 --> 27:40.880]  run by the big Republican establishment if you think you're gonna get real
[27:40.880 --> 27:47.640]  change from that I got a bridge I'm wanting to sell you on the moon just
[27:47.640 --> 27:53.120]  like with Obama I started making the Obama deception the day he was elected
[27:53.120 --> 27:59.400]  and it was released about a month and a half after he was in office and that
[27:59.400 --> 28:04.840]  film has been seen more than 30 million times for free online and it's really
[28:04.840 --> 28:12.320]  caused a political sea change out there and people watch it and they go how did
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.240]  this guy make this film everything you said came true because I knew who Obama's
[28:16.240 --> 28:21.640]  advisors were I knew who his financial supporters were and I know how the
[28:21.640 --> 28:27.880]  globalist operate and now here I am seeing national polls where voters the
[28:27.880 --> 28:37.560]  vast majority almost 70% trust Republicans almost 2 to 1 over Democrats
[28:37.560 --> 28:42.960]  just like they trusted Democrats close to 2 to 1 right before Obama got in and
[28:42.960 --> 28:48.960]  I don't want to relive this groundhog day again I don't want to go through this
[28:48.960 --> 28:55.600]  again we don't have time we're in deep trouble we're in a depression that's
[28:55.600 --> 28:59.440]  now being admitted the very same banks that orchestrated it got more power
[28:59.440 --> 29:05.920]  through the banker bailout and through the financial overhaul and again I had
[29:05.920 --> 29:14.480]  to watch Glen Beck say we've got to support the banker bailout it's not
[29:14.480 --> 29:23.960]  big enough always at the key point he stabs you in the back we don't have
[29:23.960 --> 29:29.000]  time to hate Obama so much that we think we win with a bunch of establishment
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.320]  Republicans and then three four years later we figure out they've cheated us
[29:32.320 --> 29:38.280]  and we think we win with the next Obama no Chuck Baldwin said it best we don't
[29:38.280 --> 29:43.320]  need a new movement we need a revolution a peaceful revolution but we need to get
[29:43.320 --> 29:48.720]  really serious and if you think Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin are gonna lead us

[34:02.840 --> 34:07.320]  we're back live thank you for joining us we're gonna have open phones in the

[34:14.160 --> 34:20.160]  important subjects is going to be joining us coming up in the third hour
[34:20.160 --> 34:26.160]  today you know here's an issue that I want to hear from Rush Limbaugh and Glenn
[34:26.160 --> 34:32.760]  back on Finland suspends flu shots after vaccine linked with neurological
[34:32.760 --> 34:38.400]  disorders India halts vaccine program after four deaths of children they died
[34:38.400 --> 34:43.680]  instantly after being injected within minutes
[34:43.680 --> 34:48.200]  meanwhile they're back pushing it again England suspends the shot under five
[34:48.200 --> 34:51.720]  year olds with tenfold increase in seizures you know we're right about
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.680]  that again we were right about the autoimmune diseases the brain inflammation
[34:56.680 --> 35:05.200]  the blood running out of babies noses you know I have shied away from really
[35:05.200 --> 35:12.200]  going after Glenn back and Rush Limbaugh and I've tried to support them and
[35:12.200 --> 35:15.960]  praise them when I've seen good out of them and I feel dirty every time I do
[35:15.960 --> 35:21.160]  it you know why I try to support them at a conscious level I don't like in
[35:21.160 --> 35:24.920]  fighters I don't like people that critique other talk show hosts and spend
[35:24.920 --> 35:28.360]  all their time going after people if you've noticed you hardly ever hear that
[35:28.360 --> 35:34.480]  for me very rarely but I spent a lot of time this weekend because Glenn back was
[35:34.480 --> 35:40.920]  so much in the news it focused it it forced me to focus and to really
[35:40.920 --> 35:49.160]  remember why I have such a bad feeling about Glenn back and I wrote an entire
[35:49.160 --> 35:59.960]  booklet of notes over the weekend and I was like oh my gosh I had an epiphany I
[35:59.960 --> 36:07.640]  had an epiphany and I thought about this last year I didn't do it because I
[36:07.640 --> 36:14.880]  guess at a spiritual level it is painful to investigate Glenn back he's like a
[36:14.880 --> 36:23.400]  little pig demon a little piggy monster and I'd rather at a conscious level just
[36:23.400 --> 36:28.280]  rationalize and go well he's opening up a lot of doors he's getting people to
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.000]  admit there's globalism and that the globalists want to destroy the family
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.200]  and you know he's doing a lot of good yeah but he's still promoting wars he's
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.280]  not telling you how the big mega banks control the communist and the
[36:43.280 --> 36:49.720]  progressives as he calls them he's not telling you about the vaccines he's not
[36:49.720 --> 36:56.160]  giving people the real answers he's not going all the way and I'm glad that I
[36:56.160 --> 37:01.760]  thought about Glenn back quite a bit and then happened to tune in and heard
[37:01.760 --> 37:07.680]  limbaugh because you don't know how much I want to believe in limbaugh how much I
[37:07.680 --> 37:10.960]  want to believe he's really woken up you know when he's talking about secret
[37:10.960 --> 37:15.440]  elites and blue bloods that want to destroy America and I get on air and
[37:15.440 --> 37:21.400]  I praise him yeah I want to turn the corner I want to win I want to beat
[37:21.400 --> 37:27.120]  this thing because I realize how monstrous these globals these globalist
[37:27.120 --> 37:31.640]  are I realize they're a pack of killers they're not just corrupt good old boys
[37:31.640 --> 37:36.280]  that want to dominate society they want to bankrupt things they want to break
[37:36.280 --> 37:43.160]  down the borders they want to truly re-engineer this society and have massive
[37:43.160 --> 37:50.760]  purges of patriots they're training for it and I know that when George Bush was
[37:50.760 --> 37:57.320]  in office Glenn Beck was reading off of ADL Southern Poverty Law Center scripts
[37:57.320 --> 38:05.800]  every single day and attacking Ron Paul so I was forced to go after him at the
[38:05.800 --> 38:07.800]  time
[38:11.800 --> 38:20.560]  even though I was told to the grapevine if you attack Glenn Beck we're gonna
[38:20.560 --> 38:26.200]  make sure that you don't get interviewed on these big clear channel owned radio
[38:26.200 --> 38:30.920]  shows or we're gonna make sure it's cut back to nothing and I was I was you know
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.720]  told this and of course it's off records I don't break my journalistic
[38:34.720 --> 38:40.120]  integrity and then I was told that Glenn Beck has five people listening to the
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.880]  show every day writing notes and when I was told this by two separate high level
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.880]  Fox News individuals I'll just leave it at that one of them is a household name
[38:48.880 --> 38:56.320]  the other is an executive when I was told this it kind of creep me out and I
[38:56.320 --> 39:05.800]  didn't know what to do about it and I just kind of backed off Glenn Beck just
[39:05.800 --> 39:09.400]  so I could try to figure out what was going on I mean I was still criticizing
[39:09.400 --> 39:15.760]  him but I kind of went into a cogitative format of Glenn Beck is has five
[39:15.760 --> 39:19.720]  people listening to every word I say writing notes they're sitting in a
[39:19.720 --> 39:25.320]  war room right now Glenn Beck is obsessed with me and tells everyone don't go on
[39:25.320 --> 39:31.480]  his show or I won't have you on my show and has network executives from radio
[39:31.480 --> 39:38.480]  put pressure on other hosts not to have me on you know how creepy it is to have
[39:38.480 --> 39:43.560]  three reports last week put out on me saying I'm the number one enemy of the
[39:43.560 --> 39:47.160]  Southern Prairie Law Center you know what it's like to have the ADL say I'm
[39:47.160 --> 39:50.440]  the number one enemy you know what number one they sound the number one
[39:50.440 --> 39:55.240]  evil out there do you know what it's like to have when cops are killed and
[39:55.240 --> 40:01.520]  Pittsburgh within two hours to have the media saying it's my fault and I got a
[40:01.520 --> 40:09.560]  bunch of news and I want to get into it and talk about it and cover it it's just
[40:09.560 --> 40:15.320]  I've got so many thoughts so many points because this this has to deal with
[40:15.320 --> 40:21.600]  everything I stand for I mean I'm trying to wake people up and I wake folks up
[40:21.600 --> 40:29.640]  to the New World Order at record levels going back five six years ago when we
[40:29.640 --> 40:36.720]  really started reaching millions a day not just millions a month or a week and
[40:36.720 --> 40:47.640]  to see all of my semantical terms taken and repackaged and used as a weapon
[40:47.640 --> 40:52.560]  angers me when I would attack Bush it would be co-opted and twisted by the
[40:52.560 --> 40:58.600]  controlled left and would end up serving the Democratic Party and now
[40:58.600 --> 41:03.160]  everything I do to an even greater level is taken and repackaged and used to
[41:03.160 --> 41:08.320]  attack Obama and I could see the media setting him up for destruction I said
[41:08.320 --> 41:13.240]  this would happen in the Obama deception getting ready to put all the blame on
[41:13.240 --> 41:18.360]  him and then he moves off the stage and the new puppet comes on who then is
[41:18.360 --> 41:22.720]  built up as the savior and then destroyed and the cycle goes on over and
[41:22.720 --> 41:25.080]  over again
[41:32.640 --> 41:40.320]  put it to you this way it is not a good feeling to have all of these really
[41:40.320 --> 41:45.400]  powerful organizations obsessed with what I do tracking everything I do
[41:45.400 --> 41:50.360]  attacking me from every angle a lot of people would get on a power trip and
[41:50.360 --> 41:55.520]  would go crazy with megalomania we've seen a lot of people do that or they go
[41:55.520 --> 42:05.440]  crazy from a stress instead of that it's really the opposite I feel my soul
[42:05.440 --> 42:10.280]  growing and my understanding growing and my knowledge growing and my wisdom
[42:10.280 --> 42:19.040]  growing but then I also can see what I'm doing on air and can analyze what I'm
[42:19.040 --> 42:24.560]  saying and doing on air and and critique it to myself and then I don't
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.000]  even feel worthy to be here
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.960]  but then I look at the other people that the system has put up there as
[42:35.960 --> 42:41.600]  counterfeits of patriots of Ron Paul of myself and of the art type of freedom
[42:41.600 --> 42:47.280]  that all of us represent who are on the side of good and it's just very
[42:47.280 --> 42:50.000]  frustrating
[42:55.160 --> 43:00.560]  it is frustrating to have all this news in front of me it's frustrating to have
[43:00.560 --> 43:05.920]  everything we've talked about confirmed in triplicate because we don't see the
[43:05.920 --> 43:15.280]  awakening happening fast enough and we see these clearly transparent bad guys
[43:15.280 --> 43:21.080]  on both sides of the controlled political spectrum like a Don King fight we
[43:21.080 --> 43:28.000]  know Don King owns both fighters we know it's a rigged game and everything we've
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.000]  talked about has come true and still we then see people that we woke up to Bush
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.120]  being conned by Obama and now people were waking up to Obama are falling
[43:40.120 --> 43:47.880]  under the spell of Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney and and and Newt
[43:47.880 --> 43:55.240]  Gennrich I guess it's really this at the end of the day I don't relish being
[43:55.240 --> 44:04.240]  well-known I don't relish everything that comes with it I just want to get these
[44:04.240 --> 44:10.320]  people out of my life and I I realized that things are gonna get a lot worse
[44:10.320 --> 44:17.560]  before they get better and Glenn Beck is such a sophisticated multi-faceted
[44:17.560 --> 44:28.080]  multi-layer Cyop that I really at the end of the day realize the reason that I've
[44:28.080 --> 44:39.680]  only sporadically spoken out against him is because I can't just come on air and
[44:39.680 --> 44:46.040]  expose a few facets of what Glenn Beck represents because if I do that and if I
[44:46.040 --> 44:52.400]  don't do it properly his Cyop is designed by the Pentagon and the
[44:52.400 --> 45:04.280]  psych warfare chiefs to where it will only empower him and at the same time the
[45:04.280 --> 45:11.360]  vibe I get off of Beck is a tortured very unhappy soul who all he has is
[45:11.360 --> 45:22.600]  competitiveness and dominating those around him and it's it's it's painful
[45:22.600 --> 45:29.640]  to look into his soul it's painful to turn my intellect on him and really
[45:29.640 --> 45:41.800]  analyze what he is because it's so horrible and I I I shirk responsibility
[45:41.800 --> 45:47.600]  at a subconscious level I've been working for two years on a eugenics film
[45:47.600 --> 45:52.880]  that covers the total master plan of the globalist and I've put it off again with
[45:52.880 --> 45:58.160]  my crew until early next year because I we've done over 20 interviews around the
[45:58.160 --> 46:05.120]  country just the plane tickets and hotels or 80 plus grand and for us that's a
[46:05.120 --> 46:12.200]  lot of money we're way over budget and I just can't release it because it's not
[46:12.200 --> 46:17.400]  ready I learned more every day we get more Rockefeller Foundation documents
[46:17.400 --> 46:21.320]  that are public about other poison in the food and water in the vaccines and I
[46:21.320 --> 46:24.240]  think about all the kids are hurting every time I look at my children they're
[46:24.240 --> 46:31.160]  so innocent and good I I started crying this morning because I think about these
[46:31.160 --> 46:35.640]  murderers and how much fun they have trying to hurt little ones I think about
[46:35.640 --> 46:41.000]  all the children I can't protect and then I think to myself if I make a
[46:41.000 --> 46:46.160]  glenbeck deception it's got to be really research and I've got all the research
[46:46.160 --> 46:51.120]  and it's got to be powerful it's got to really show people what I know about him
[46:51.120 --> 46:56.800]  so that when he betrays them to a greater extent they will recognize
[46:56.800 --> 47:04.440]  Judas Iscariot so that he can then be used for good to complete the awakening
[47:04.440 --> 47:13.960]  Clinton took us so far Bush senior before that Bush Jr. Obama but I believe by
[47:13.960 --> 47:17.640]  doing an expose on the controlled Republican Party and the controlled
[47:17.640 --> 47:26.160]  right wing in this country that the circle will be complete so I'm suspending
[47:26.160 --> 47:30.520]  all other filmmaking I'm committing now you have my promise that before
[47:30.520 --> 47:36.880]  Christmas I will release the glenbeck deception you have my word on this
[47:36.880 --> 47:42.680]  unless I get killed or have a car wreck or have family issues unforeseen crises
[47:42.680 --> 47:48.600]  that I will complete and deliver to you the glenbeck deception and so we will
[47:48.600 --> 47:52.960]  have the Obama deception to expose the phony left and who finances it we will
[47:52.960 --> 47:57.040]  have the Obama deception and I will show you that they are funded by the exact
[47:57.040 --> 48:01.360]  same interest see that's where I've got glenbeck I know he's funded by the same
[48:01.360 --> 48:06.240]  people that run Obama I know he reads off teleprompters written by the Southern
[48:06.240 --> 48:11.360]  Prairie Law Center ADL I know he's in the Pentagon hip pocket he's even bragged
[48:11.360 --> 48:21.360]  about it I know who he is and I know what he's being positioned for and so I'm
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.480]  going all in against the right wing establishment just like when they were
[48:25.480 --> 48:30.120]  raising Obama up as the messianic Christ to save earth and putting him on
[48:30.120 --> 48:35.000]  jewelry and coins and plates and you know saying he was like Jesus on the
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.400]  news remember that I said the bigger they are the harder they fall he will be
[48:39.400 --> 48:44.120]  built up to ram through the banking takeover the health care takeover and to
[48:44.120 --> 48:51.880]  keep the wars going then he will be destroyed to bring in what will
[48:51.880 --> 48:57.280]  probably be the final right wing fake coup everything's converging where they
[48:57.280 --> 49:04.160]  may let Obama do it with a stage nuke attack probably not though it's gonna
[49:04.160 --> 49:09.280]  be the right wing messianic leader and and and America is gonna hate Obama so
[49:09.280 --> 49:15.800]  much by the time he's done with his role that Sarah Palin Glenn Beck and others
[49:15.800 --> 49:19.400]  are going to be godlike they are gonna take on the Bill of Rights the
[49:19.400 --> 49:23.520]  Constitution they're gonna take on the anti eugenics mantle they're already
[49:23.520 --> 49:27.360]  starting now I mean you see it a guest is on here a month later they're on their
[49:27.360 --> 49:31.280]  show I cover eugenics I cover a book it's on Beck show a week later but with
[49:31.280 --> 49:35.280]  his spin that it's oh some little low-level progressives that are doing
[49:35.280 --> 49:45.560]  this no this is scientifically funded and so I'm going to expose Glenn Beck but
[49:45.560 --> 49:50.520]  through that I'm going to complete the expose at the left right paradigm and
[49:50.520 --> 49:56.360]  show people how they're controlled and I have to do this I mean I've come to the
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.800]  realization I can't let all my work and all of my blood sweat and tears and
[50:00.800 --> 50:10.920]  literally pouring my guts my soul into this I can't have them like the giant
[50:10.920 --> 50:17.280]  grab me up and say be he live or be he dead I'll grind his bones to make my
[50:17.280 --> 50:22.880]  bread I can't be ground up and put in this loaf of poison bread that Glenn
[50:22.880 --> 50:28.800]  Beck and Fox News are gonna sell everybody remember under Bush the
[50:28.800 --> 50:33.960]  derivatives the banking scams the torture the wars the Patriot Act all of
[50:33.960 --> 50:42.680]  it was built for you the American people and now they're going to come to power
[50:42.680 --> 50:47.240]  see now we've defeated Obama as their vessel now we've got to switch our
[50:47.240 --> 50:52.880]  targeting guns in the info war over against the neocons that want to
[50:52.880 --> 50:59.320]  hijack the Tea Party that Ron Paul created we'll be right back

[54:24.120 --> 54:28.240]  okay I'm done talking about Glenn Beck but that's all anybody's talking about
[54:28.240 --> 54:35.760]  and so it was a stunt to go to the Lincoln Memorial on the day of Martin
[54:35.760 --> 54:40.520]  Luther King and I think it was a brilliant stunt I mean that's what the
[54:40.520 --> 54:45.800]  Democrats and the Liberals do the problem is we know Beck is handled by the
[54:45.800 --> 54:51.160]  Republican Party the Republican Party a year and a half ago saw the fact that
[54:51.160 --> 54:55.480]  all over the country they were being booed at town hall meetings and so they
[54:55.480 --> 54:58.920]  teamed up with the liberal media to come out and say the Tea Parties are right
[54:58.920 --> 55:03.520]  wing and the controlled left went along with that hoax the Republicans tried to
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.360]  co-op the Tea Party to a great extent they did so that the revolution against
[55:08.360 --> 55:12.840]  tyranny is now controlled by one of the two parties that's bought and paid for
[55:12.840 --> 55:19.800]  by the very same special interest it's that simple it's that simple and it also
[55:19.800 --> 55:24.760]  makes the movement about presidents and about Washington instead of taking our
[55:24.760 --> 55:31.480]  counties our cities and our states back this is what we need to do this is what
[55:31.480 --> 55:40.240]  we need to do now it is so vitally important and all I'm saying is I'm
[55:40.240 --> 55:43.880]  gonna put out the Glenn Beck deception I'm gonna be criticized just like the
[55:43.880 --> 55:47.440]  Obama deception and then people are gonna see it a year or two later and
[55:47.440 --> 55:53.680]  there it's and they're gonna say how did this guy know all this because I've
[55:53.680 --> 56:00.880]  studied these people I've got their playbook I understand it I was called a
[56:00.880 --> 56:08.440]  communist when I didn't like George W. Bush I'm called the right wing extremist
[56:08.440 --> 56:13.080]  because I don't like Barack Obama it's so elementary these guys are puppets
[56:13.080 --> 56:18.960]  these guys are frontmen they give you different rhetoric but they vote the
[56:18.960 --> 56:26.720]  same and the system knew they were gonna put Obama in here's the issue the
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.360]  Republicans you better not just get satisfied by them getting an office you
[56:30.360 --> 56:34.640]  better repeal all the government health care already bankrupting the nation they
[56:34.640 --> 56:39.760]  better repeal the banker bailouts they better repeal the expanded power for the
[56:39.760 --> 56:43.480]  Federal Reserve and audit it they'd better get our troops out all these
[56:43.480 --> 56:48.120]  countries we're going bankrupt but don't look for that unless you keep their
[56:48.120 --> 56:53.560]  feet to the fire that's my main message just like I told Democrats Obama
[56:53.560 --> 56:58.040]  nothing but lobbyists he hired continuing the torture continuing the
[56:58.040 --> 57:02.120]  banking bailouts you and now they're getting disillusioned but who do they
[57:02.120 --> 57:07.280]  go vote for Republicans well you don't vote for establishment Republicans but
[57:07.280 --> 57:12.560]  if you can find a constitutionalist there are better candidates being fielded
[57:12.560 --> 57:16.800]  through the Republican Party and the Libertarian Party because they do at
[57:16.800 --> 57:23.160]  least on paper have more Americana views but this is how the globalist
[57:23.160 --> 57:28.840]  managing the Republicans they kind of play the part of establishment and then
[57:28.840 --> 57:32.080]  the Democrats get in and take us down the road and then Republicans get back
[57:32.080 --> 57:38.080]  in power and never repeal any of the tyranny and Republicans launch the
[57:38.080 --> 57:47.360]  military tyranny the Democrats launch all of their creeping socialism tyranny
[57:47.360 --> 57:52.440]  and expand military tyranny and expand domestic tyranny and then Republicans
[57:52.440 --> 57:56.200]  get in and do the same things they just do it for different reasons I got one

[1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:14.160]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex
[1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:22.400]  jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:33.400]  all right my friends the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:42.160]  I spent much of the last hour talking about glenbeck his rally and how he is
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:46.480]  saying a lot of the right things but is being used just like obama said a lot of
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:51.280]  the right things and once they get the republicans back in power you're going
[1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:55.680]  to see the same sellout because both these parties are bought and paid for by
[1:00:55.680 --> 1:00:59.680]  the same interest and they've got think tanks focus groups you name it on how
[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:05.000]  to con you how to bamboozle you and I have a responsibility to not have my
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:11.520]  work my research my ideas of true constitutional populism taken by glen
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:17.720]  back and it's admitted that he's doing this and turning it into a kind of
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:22.160]  republicanoid version of what we do and so I'm going to make the glenbeck
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.720]  deception and I'm going to rush it out in the next two months I'm shifting all my
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:31.360]  attention to this I'm not going to screw around anymore because I had a moment of
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:35.200]  clarity understanding this and it's the right thing to do and I'm going to do it
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:40.680]  I'm going to expose him because it has to be done just like with Obama I went up
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:45.760]  against Obama when he was at his ultimate you know star had risen because
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:49.240]  if we'd allowed him to become this messianic leader and carrying their
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:53.200]  agenda he could have taken the country down he's already done a pretty good
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:58.040]  job as a front man it's the same thing with this coterie you know this four
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:04.800]  horsemen of the neocons glenbeck sarapan rush limbaugh and then kind of an
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:08.960]  amalgamation of the others being the fourth horsemen and we've got to expose
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:13.320]  these four horsemen now because I've seen their track record I know who they
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:17.120]  are I know where they're going and I'm just going to lay it out for people so
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:20.680]  I'm done talking about it if you want to call in that's fine okay here's the
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:25.760]  other news Watson is coming on in the next hour to talk about this this is a
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:29.840]  big deal we have a chance to save a lot of people's lives and save a lot of
[1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:36.680]  people from serious heartache Finland England India a bunch of other countries
[1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:41.000]  have come out and said look we don't know what's in that H1N1 shop but it's

[1:02:55.120 --> 1:03:00.480]  controversy itself literally run by Fox News and the CIA that whole thing
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:04.440]  staged on both sides you know distractions like that we're gonna
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:07.640]  cover something that affects everybody whether you're a Christian a Muslim a
[1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:14.720]  Jew an atheist okay also on the First Amendment issue so to my or is saying
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:19.760]  that they may have to restrict the First Amendment you got to love these
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:26.280]  operatives they put in you know also DOJ Department of Justice demonizes
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:30.280]  constitutionalist is extremist criminals we're gonna be going over that
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:33.480]  report as well and the government think tank calls for infiltrating
[1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:37.920]  conspiracy websites this is new this is actually the London Independent so it
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:43.200]  dovetails with the whole Cass Sunstein situation and I also want to get into
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:53.840]  the Roger Clemens situation a little bit and dovetail that with some issues and
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:59.320]  give you an example of contemporary corruption and then every day I come in
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:06.880]  and I I send the crew stories that I see dealing with immigration and they
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:12.880]  always print some out for me and really what we discovered to be going on a
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:17.520]  decade ago or more in Mexico and now intensifying in the last five years is
[1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:34.200]  now just publicly available information and there's this contrast between the
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:38.360]  fact that Mexico is being imploded by design and the fact that still the
[1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:41.880]  American people don't seem to understand this show that's coming up at first

[1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:07.200]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:11.240]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:15.120]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:19.160]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:23.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:28.360]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:32.080]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:35.560]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:39.520]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:26.040]  lines of the info war okay we are back live ladies and gentlemen coming up
[1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:32.840]  Mexican massacre investigator found dead the gentleman that investigated the 72
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:37.800]  immigrants from Central and South America who had been killed execution
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:43.760]  style reportedly by Los Zetas he's been killed a second mayor has been taken out
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:48.560]  of his house and murdered in front of his family two car bombs explode in
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:55.280]  northern Mexico Mexicans fear cartels are winning Mexican elicit cultivation of
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:09:00.800]  opium poppies is exploding the more illegal you make drugs the more money
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:05.280]  they make the more drugs you have Brewer condemns report to UN mentioning
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:10.960]  Arizona law yeah that's right Obama had worried about Mexico collapsing or the
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:15.480]  fact that CIA train Los Zetas is down there kidnapping people in mass and now
[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:20.960]  kidnapping US citizens constantly and demanding money that's not an issue the
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:25.920]  fact that police might pull over an illegal alien for drunk driving and ask
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:29.520]  for their driver's license that's the issue now if you're a citizen you got a
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:34.080]  show papers lick boots you're an illegal you're above the law and so Obama's
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:38.640]  going to the UN for that and of course we have Arizona sheriff saying the
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:42.520]  border patrol has retreated from the border because it's too dangerous and
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:47.160]  there's murder hits out on them so the United States government hey they've
[1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:52.920]  got fat dumb and happy Americans to shake down and I've done research on
[1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:56.520]  that our border patrol is becoming extremely corrupt being paid off as
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:04.480]  well both sides we're in a lot of trouble so that's coming up but right now
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:11.840]  let's go to your phone calls Amy in Ohio you're on the air hi I'm talking to
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:15.440]  you I'm enjoying your show I've been listening to you for a couple months on
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:20.880]  the internet what I'm real I have watched Glenn Beck before and you've been
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:26.600]  talking about him today the thing I don't understand is how do people not get
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:32.800]  that there's a new world order I guess is it the media that you know are they
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.800]  puppets well look I mean of course I mean the dominant media is owned by the
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:41.360]  very same banking institutions who can create unlimited money and so what do
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:45.360]  you think you're gonna see from these people so they put in fake liberals to
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:49.280]  lead the liberal opposition they put in fake conservatives to lead the
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:56.240]  Republican opposition and I mean where was Glenn Beck during the banker bailout
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:11:00.200]  under Bush he was supporting it where was he with the Patriot Act he was
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:04.720]  supporting it and he's gonna support it all when Republicans are in office and
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:09.720]  then Democrats are gonna be against torture and wars and the Patriot Act
[1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:15.000]  but they're all for it because they're in power now the very same special interest
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:22.400]  own these people it's so elementary and my issue with Glenn Beck is he's being
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:27.320]  built up by the left and the right as the opposition leader so he can lead the
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:32.160]  opposition I mean it's so elementary you had Ron Paul creating the Tea Parties
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:38.320]  in 2007 you had a true libertarian conservative anti-globalist movement who
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:44.400]  was anti-war anti-fetal reserve pro-state rights anti-banker bailout and
[1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:49.960]  then you had Glenn Beck attacking that movement at that key time every day on
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:56.440]  radio and TV now I'm supposed to watch him come in as my savior now and sit
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:02.280]  there and tell me all about God and and and how he's my leader and everything
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:07.760]  so that I can prepare for his Lord and Savior Mitt Romney and and and and Newt
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.720]  Gennrich and and bow down to them I mean it's so obvious what's going on he's
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:17.840]  controlled by the same people that run Obama but see even the liberal media is
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:21.760]  now turning their back on Obama he's off message he's got problems he's arrogant
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:27.760]  they're getting ready to destroy Obama and bring in the next puppet who will
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:33.080]  then be destroyed and and we're all like a moth towards the flame obsessed with
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:37.520]  this instead of looking at the puppet masters what did Bill Hicks say got a
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:41.120]  puppet on the left puppet on the right wait a minute there's one guy holding
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:49.280]  both puppets ma'am I appreciate your call let's go to Mike in Colorado Mike
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:54.800]  you're on the air how's it going good sir I appreciate coming on your show you
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:13:02.040]  know I listened to Glenn Beck for over a year you know constantly at some advice
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:06.240]  of my family and then as advice of a different friend I started listening to
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:09.680]  you and stopped listening to Glenn Beck for listening to you for at least over a
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:14.360]  year at least two and a half hours every day so I have a good feeling of watch
[1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:18.320]  most your videos of what's going on in your perspective versus Glenn's
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:21.080]  perspective and one thing I wanted to take you to task on is the thing about
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:27.920]  him supporting the tarp bailout he said multiple times on a show that he did
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:32.000]  not at first he thought it was a good idea and three days later he said no
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:37.120]  it's not a good idea I was wrong after it passed but still I mean you're not
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:41.040]  giving him any benefit of the doubt on that and you you look at the big picture
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:44.360]  all the time trying to say you you just know for sure you know like he's some
[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:47.960]  kind of an evil person I just don't believe it well you watch you I don't
[1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:51.400]  know how many Democrats told me the same thing about Obama just watch buddy but
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:56.360]  don't lie to yourself so much Mike that that that after you see what's gonna
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:59.840]  happen to this country when the Republicans get control of things just
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:04.040]  remember that you got committed and wedded to him just like Clinton
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:08.840]  supporters or George W Bush supporters or Obama supporters but let me explain
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:12.960]  something to you and then I want to hear you know here you have your say Mike
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:19.800]  okay I mean believe me if I only cared about Alex Jones in my radio career I
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:24.480]  wouldn't have come on air and said 911 was an inside job before it happened and
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:29.640]  after it happened the day it happened you think that was a popular thing to do
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:36.300]  no it wasn't do you think going after Obama when he was at the ultimate peak
[1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:42.200]  of his messianic success you think that was to win a popularity contest there's
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:46.400]  plenty of people that were going after him all over the place at that time but
[1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:50.480]  not from the perspective of a constitutionalist they were going after
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:55.600]  you from a right-wing perspective and he had a huge approval rating of almost
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:15:02.360]  90% now let me just stop for just a moment here Benedict Arnold won many
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:07.120]  battles do you know who Benedict Arnold is no I can't I've heard the name I
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:12.320]  can't place it okay he was almost as famous as George Washington he was a
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:23.120]  continental army and then you know later he was one of the generals in the
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:27.920]  war for independence against the British you know about that right right
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:33.000]  okay now now Benedict Arnold would give great speeches he was a wonderful guy
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.320]  he would win these battles but it turned out the whole time he was a British
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:44.480]  double agent and at key points when the British had a chance to once and for all
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:50.640]  smash the rebels that's when he revealed himself now it they were getting a
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:57.280]  thousand to one phone calls against the Tart Bill the Congress had said no the
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:03.280]  bankers had plunged the stock market by a thousand points to terrorize the public
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:06.480]  and they had all the top bankers come out and say we're gonna have a depression
[1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:12.880]  if you don't give us this banker bailout and then October 3rd they passed it
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:20.560]  October 4th the head of the Treasury Henry Paulson said I'm not going to tell
[1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:28.480]  you where the money went now Beck sure a few weeks later said oh I was wrong I
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:34.080]  apologize I misunderstood just like he misunderstood when he read word for word
[1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:39.160]  out of the Southern Poverty Law Centers hit pieces on Ron Paul right when Ron
[1:16:39.160 --> 1:16:43.840]  Paul had a chance of winning the nomination right at that key point right
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:50.280]  at the key point whenever Debra Medina had a chance to torpedo her right at
[1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:55.640]  the always at the key point his periscope comes up when he's got your
[1:16:55.640 --> 1:17:03.360]  confidence and he fires torpedoes and I have been there I have seen it I have
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:09.400]  witnessed it and I know who runs Fox News I mean I I've been here all these
[1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:12.880]  years and many others have exposing world government being laughed at by the
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:17.000]  Fox News crowd now they come out and say okay it's all real because the globalist
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.720]  have gone public but then they still say okay it's real but if you don't you know
[1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:26.720]  basically agree with us you're a kook it still doesn't exist I mean have you
[1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:30.760]  heard Glenn Beck make fun of people to talk about Bilderberg group I wanted is
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:35.000]  that's what I wanted to say next you know when he I was to show about a month
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:39.960]  ago maybe even less and he came and a lot of the followers of Glenn Beck say
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:42.800]  you know he's speaking cryptically about different things because he can't come
[1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:46.960]  out and say things outright and I personally believe you know that he's not
[1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:50.440]  a bad person trying to mislead that he's even more of a pawn what do you mean
[1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:55.200]  you can't come out hey hey listen buddy I was offered everything when Beck's been
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:18:00.400]  given okay and I said no to it what do you mean he can't come out well he
[1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:04.400]  apparently is feels like you know that's a sellout see this is why we're
[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:07.720]  slaves this is why we're gonna lose everything Mike okay there's a good
[1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:11.320]  chance we're gonna lose and down the road you're gonna say Alex Jones was
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:16.960]  right it's this attitude of he can't come out all the way this attitude of
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:22.720]  he's got to speak in code he's got to write a book the Overton window saying
[1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:26.960]  this is faction this is real stuff in fiction at the end he says their
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:32.560]  government's not staged in terror there aren't FEMA camps and this book is
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:37.560]  fiction that's double-speak this is faction this is really going on at the
[1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:43.000]  end okay you bought my book you read it this isn't going on it's confusion that's
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:47.760]  what I'm telling you that's what I'm telling you listen I know people at Fox
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:52.760]  News high up you understand Glenn Beck is obsessed with this show Glenn Beck has
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:57.560]  five operatives listening right now Glenn Beck tells people don't go on
[1:18:57.560 --> 1:19:02.240]  Alex Jones's show Glenn Beck goes around to radio executives saying don't have him
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:06.640]  on the radio Glenn Beck is scared of the Patriot movement he's got two retired
[1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:13.360]  FBI agents guarding him not from Muslims but from Patriots and listen I know a
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:16.960]  lot about Glenn Beck you don't know do you understand that well yeah that's why
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:21.200]  one is I would like your confirmation that so you have a hundred percent
[1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:23.920]  confirmed source that the people at Fox News that he's doing that stuff
[1:19:23.920 --> 1:19:29.080]  absolutely and and the other thing and I know you can just say that this is you
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:32.480]  know more confusion he specifically stated in his talk radio show is that
[1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:36.720]  look he doesn't deal with the things that other quote other talk radio shows
[1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:40.720]  talk about he's not that's not what his show is about he's basically saying to
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:44.280]  me look I'm not gonna talk about what Alex Jones is talking about I'm talking
[1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:48.960]  about different stuff and that's not what here's the deal long before I now
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:52.360]  discovered I ever talked about Glenn Beck four or five years ago I was
[1:19:52.360 --> 1:19:56.240]  supportive of him till I saw him reading ADL stuff on air Southern Prairie Law

[1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:25.400]  okay i don't want to spend all day on glenbeck that's why i'm going to make a
[1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:28.840]  documentary about him i'm going to show his flip-flopping
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:33.240]  i'm going to show who funds him i'm going to show the republicans on foxing
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:36.600]  there's no world government there's no banking plan
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:41.000]  there's no international bankers there's no derivatives
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.560]  they all are paid for by the same people that's all i'm saying
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:48.760]  now does there tend to be some better people of the few good senators and
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:53.400]  house members that are republican like senator de min
[1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:58.600]  or ron paul yes that's the case do i have more in common with republicans
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:04.840]  yes because they at least claim their constitutionalist
[1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:08.120]  but when they get in power they forget the constitution
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:11.880]  obama claimed he was this big civil libertarian look what he's done
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:15.720]  remember keith oberman how he was exposing tyranny and
[1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:18.920]  chaining wanting to blow up us ships and blaming on iran and
[1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:26.120]  all these things and now obama's in you don't hear any criticism of obama
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:32.200]  and all you see from msnbc is race pimping hyping religious differences
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:36.360]  and it's the same thing from fox and they do it in the name of unity
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:41.480]  but all they do is raise these issues they are working from the same sheet of
[1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:45.080]  music just one takes the part of the villain
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:49.000]  one takes the part of the good guy depending on what perspective you've
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.760]  got if you're a democrat obama's good if you're a republican
[1:25:52.760 --> 1:25:57.560]  obama's bad vice versa and i'm gonna go after glenn
[1:25:57.560 --> 1:26:05.080]  back because i know that he's put out the word
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:11.080]  to try to keep me off radio stations and off the
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:15.320]  air i know he's put out the word for people not
[1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:19.000]  to go on my show or he threatens to blackball them
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:23.880]  i know he's got at least five people that listen to my show and track everything
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:26.920]  i do and then he's got the nerve to try to be
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:30.200]  involved in my life stopping me from getting the word out
[1:26:30.200 --> 1:26:34.680]  well of course he copies everything i am he twist it he turns into a roger
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:39.160]  ale's fox production it comes back on me i've
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:42.760]  got to have a little old lady saying you sound just like glenn back no i don't
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:48.440]  old lady listen a little closer so i need to stand up and identify
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:53.560]  who i am versus what glenn back is for heaven's sakes mike i'm gonna go back
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:57.640]  give me the final word on this i've now had a chance to read almost the whole
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:04.040]  book the overton window and the character
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:08.520]  bailey is alex jones it's a patriot talk show host
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:11.720]  who releases the myack report that law enforcement gave them
[1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:14.680]  that's me we're the ones that released it
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:18.280]  canza city star on record
[1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:23.320]  and i i'm stopping the nukes that the government wants to detonate to bring
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:26.920]  in martial law he it's about false flag
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:31.400]  terror international bankers meanwhile he's saying anybody that thinks the
[1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:36.680]  government stages terror attacks is a dangerous lunatic
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:42.520]  see that's a true master manipulator is that he wants it all he sees it as a
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:46.680]  market and he is going to be an establishment republican
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:50.920]  he's going to then be the mediator who who who referees
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:53.960]  when the conspiracy people get out of control
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:59.400]  he's going to get up on tv and warn about the militias
[1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:03.480]  and when the republicans get into power he's going to attack those of us that
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:06.840]  expose their globalist agenda he's going to say we've got to have
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:10.680]  this bank of the world we've got to have this carbon tax to fund it
[1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:16.200]  gee i don't like it but we're going to go bankrupt if we don't
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:21.400]  now go ahead and you you have the final word mike go ahead
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:24.600]  well i mean you've had definitely uh you know
[1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:28.200]  but quite a prediction you made there i i do have to say that
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:32.680]  the bottom line for me with glenn back is i don't discount his faith in god i do
[1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:35.880]  happen to be mormon so i have a bias in that point
[1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:38.840]  i don't think he is intentionally misleading you know he didn't write
[1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:41.960]  those books he has writers writing that crap
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:45.080]  you know he's being handled like you said
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:48.440]  so i'm not going to demonize him personally because i believe it
[1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:52.680]  he does have a sincere belief in god in helping us out if he's being manipulated
[1:28:52.680 --> 1:28:55.640]  i'm not going to blame him as much i'm going to blame the manipulators let me
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:29:01.560]  ask you a question why would he go on a photo shoot and put fake tears in his
[1:29:01.560 --> 1:29:07.320]  eyes and laugh for the media and say this is how i fool people
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:11.080]  well that i don't even know about that couldn't speak to it i'll look it up
[1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:14.520]  well here's the good news we're going to keep glenn back honest
[1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:18.920]  and in fact that's in my notes here that that that that we hope
[1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:22.920]  he's had an awakening we hope he's grown nobody's perfect
[1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:28.840]  and we hope that by making this film we keep glenn back honest
[1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:33.640]  and point out what our concerns are once the republicans get back into power

[1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:18.440]  it's alex jones on the g-c-n radio network
[1:33:18.440 --> 1:33:22.040]  look i'm done talking about glenbeck you can raise it if you want
[1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:29.400]  let me take your calls here in a moment but it's really elementary
[1:33:29.400 --> 1:33:35.080]  fox news is the establishment they sold the lies about wmds
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:39.320]  the torture the secret arrest the patriot act
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:42.680]  they are always big cheerleaders for arresting militias
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:48.040]  who are getting set up by the feds i mean fox news is a whorehouse
[1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:51.240]  and they know that people are waking up to the new world order
[1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:55.240]  they know that i've done my job ron paul has you have
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:59.640]  and anytime we've got a patriot who's really about to take
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:04.040]  you know a house seat or a senate seat or a state house seat
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:10.840]  they're there attacking as well but it's just like democrat supporters of obama
[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:14.440]  it doesn't matter how bad you get hurt how many times you get lied to
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:17.960]  you want to believe that the establishment cares about you and
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:22.040]  wants to take good care of you what's happening is they're having to admit
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:24.520]  world government exists but put their spin on it
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:28.600]  because it's out in the open because we should have great credibility right now
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:31.880]  because we told the truth because we got laughed at
[1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:35.480]  because we did it decades ago
[1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:40.680]  but now you get some hokey people up there in fancy suits with fancy
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:44.520]  teleprompters and they give you all this song and dance and
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:48.760]  spin it all together with a bunch of neocon icing and people are like i love
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:53.080]  glen back he's going to save me he's got the democrats attacking him that
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:56.360]  means he must be good
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:02.360]  when it's all part of the same master system
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:05.400]  it doesn't matter look you're going to win you're probably going to get what
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:08.520]  you want things are just going to continue to deteriorate
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:11.560]  they're going to continue to fall apart they're going to get worse and worse
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:14.440]  and we're going to be here in five six years with the republicans
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:18.360]  going my god how much worse is it going to get and i'll have democrats calling
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:21.000]  in going you know shouldn't we believe in
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:25.160]  filling the blank democratic party operative talk show host
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:28.440]  and i'll be saying no you saw what happened with obama
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:32.040]  and then with the republicans don't let it happen again and i'll have them sit
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:36.840]  there and tell me how i'm wrong as usual
[1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:41.240]  people love to get scammed they enjoy it all right let's go to your calls
[1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:44.600]  delta in new york you're on the air delta hi alex
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:47.640]  hey buddy hey i want to talk about the federal reserve
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:50.760]  actually um can you turn your radio off that'd be
[1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:55.080]  wonderful hang on all right i really won't be able
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:59.240]  to hear i'm a internet caller can you hear me
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:02.840]  well there's just a lot of noise in the background but go ahead
[1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:07.080]  okay so uh i agree with ron paul you know about
[1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:11.720]  ending the fed but i heard you suggest putting it under congress
[1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:16.760]  so i'm just afraid that the trojan horse at the end of the day
[1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:20.920]  well i mean i'm just saying that's what the constitution states
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:24.680]  i mean you know right now congress isn't in control
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:27.640]  of the issuance of currency and credit and when they go to the private
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:31.240]  federal reserve they say we're not going to tell you mac
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:37.320]  so get lost sucker we run this country now hey hey no gangster talk
[1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:42.280]  we're not going to tell you and we run glimb back and the democrats
[1:36:42.280 --> 1:36:47.800]  so i mean what do you suggest i mean it's a good question i'm not
[1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:51.080]  sure myself but i mean congress just does a terrible
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:56.200]  job with everything so and if you put it in a congress and
[1:36:56.200 --> 1:37:00.520]  have them just you know printing money for anything i mean that
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:04.040]  could be the trojan horse that turns us into zimbabwe
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:08.520]  that could be what brings in the one world currency
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:12.280]  well you always have that with a fiat currency it's happened before in our
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:15.240]  history before we had the federal reserve system we had some fiat
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:18.120]  based currencies early on in the nation's history
[1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:22.760]  and people can always over print money up front
[1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:26.360]  buy things with it even though they know a few years down the road
[1:37:26.360 --> 1:37:29.880]  it's going to destroy much of the wealth that's been produced they don't care
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:32.680]  just like a bank robber doesn't care as long as they get away with the money
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:35.880]  or a rapist rapes and kills a woman because they like it
[1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:39.080]  they don't think of the woman as a human being
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:43.320]  but you have to get it away from the private bankers
[1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:48.280]  and under congress because that's what's in the bill of rights and constitution
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:52.200]  and then you have a public debate about the monetary system
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:56.120]  and you follow the constitution and with what it says
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:37:59.800]  about just weights and measures and that's a whole another
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:04.280]  issue but but ron paul wants the issuance of currency and credit
[1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:07.720]  back under congress and he wants a gold backed
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:11.560]  other people debate that the issue is we should at least agree
[1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:16.120]  delta on trying to get control of our money supply again
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:21.000]  i absolutely agree with that i just think that maybe you need some kind of a
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.280]  another independent group under government
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:28.280]  besides congress that's that's doing it i mean i i well that's what the u n does
[1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:31.880]  and it's not independent they call it non-governmental organizations
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:36.200]  and then they claim that that group speaks for the people not the people
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:40.440]  or that that group speaks for congress and then now you've got this independent
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:43.960]  group over the independent group that you elect look we've
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:48.120]  led a bunch of offshore banks come in and buy off both parties
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:52.200]  and so they do this tag team song and dance of when the democrats are out of
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:54.840]  power their anti-establishment
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:58.200]  and when the republicans are out of power their anti-establishment
[1:38:58.200 --> 1:39:01.880]  it's very elementary and so we need to just agree
[1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:06.440]  on the constitution and force them to follow it
[1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:10.280]  and make it illegal not to follow it and it is illegal by the way but we have to
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:13.720]  enforce that so then they can't do what these
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:17.640]  offshore scallywags want them to do delta it's very simple but it's an
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:20.360]  interesting point you raise i appreciate the call
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:23.720]  quarry in canada you're on the air

[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:44.840]  toronto i had to leave due to the lack of work when
[1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:47.960]  there the so-called recession hit or whatever
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:50.840]  but it hasn't really affected people out here and
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:54.920]  there's a lot of infrastructure projects going on in this province and i'm
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:58.600]  sure you heard about the big potash deal that's going on here and i mean
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:01.960]  the scat you on is really the future as far as people
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:06.120]  in canada are concerned or or what they believe right now and i'm just wondering
[1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:09.560]  like what's your take on our future up here
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:14.280]  well canada is passed on the most draconian anti-free speech legislation
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:17.160]  in the world they arrest preachers from reading from the
[1:40:17.160 --> 1:40:20.920]  bible uh it's openly owned by the queen two years ago
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:25.160]  when your parliament tried to actually pass laws themselves the queen
[1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:29.080]  had parliament dissolved her governor general runs everything
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:33.720]  and it's part of the propaganda that canada is a valhalla
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:39.560]  it is a utopia it is a heaven on earth i know in several provinces your police
[1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:43.080]  chiefs tried to ban these semi-automatics and
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:46.600]  tried to confiscate them and the public ran them out of office that's some
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:51.880]  good news uh but canada has some of the most draconian
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:56.280]  laws i've never been treated like i've been treated in canada by your
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:41:03.000]  by your by your police uh so um i know certain regions of canada
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:06.680]  are doing better than other parts of the world but the measure
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:11.640]  of the of the system you're under isn't just how much money you're making
[1:41:11.640 --> 1:41:16.280]  it's how much freedom you've got and it's how much liberty you've got
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:20.280]  and uh canada is really what the globalists have said the last year
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:25.640]  it is the model of world government and so they make european immigration very
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:28.440]  hard they make other immigration from anywhere
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:31.720]  else in the world very easy they have a plan for canada
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:35.400]  and uh canada is uh basically a new world order model
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:40.680]  similar to communist china anything else wow that's scary thought man honestly
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:43.880]  yeah see i never thought of it like that and i know a lot of people are really
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.560]  blinded up here and i mean i try and talk about you and spread the word
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:51.160]  and i mean there's a few people that are aware of you but not very many people
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:54.600]  are and the people that i do talk to you don't buy into it because they have
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:57.800]  good jobs and people are still making money here and stuff
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:02.040]  still moving you know what i mean but i just i just wanted your perspective on
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:05.640]  canada because you kind of leave us out a lot but like you know keep me informed
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:10.200]  because i'm a listener man well i appreciate your call kori uh we had a
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:15.320]  two guest on from canada last week and we we cover canada almost every day so i
[1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:19.880]  don't know how often you tune in uh but there there are over 190 countries
[1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:25.480]  worldwide and uh it is um hard to cover them all but but
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:30.360]  almost every nation there's less than 15 countries really if you count them up
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:35.240]  that aren't under the globalist control now the the the globalists dominate
[1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:39.560]  those nations it doesn't mean that they control every facet of every
[1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:43.480]  part of your life but that's what they want through globalism
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:48.040]  is to expand that control
[1:42:49.400 --> 1:42:56.040]  okay uh let's now go ahead and continue uh with some of the news
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:43:00.440]  before i go back to other callers uh that are patiently
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:05.320]  patiently holding looking south uh from the united states
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:12.120]  mexican massacre investigator found dead there are over 26 000 people
[1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:15.720]  that's a conservative number murdered in the last four and a half years in
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:22.200]  mexico and it is a fully collapsed society
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:25.880]  and as things collapse more and more the drug trade is all they have
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:28.760]  and of course the government keeps drugs illegal
[1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:32.200]  because the government is laundering the most of the drug money
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:35.800]  and waging war against other drug cartels they don't control
[1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:39.960]  but los zetas is quote former mexican military no they are the mexican
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:44.360]  military who are clandestinely trained by the u.s government the cia
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:47.800]  we covered this six years ago before the latest outbreak
[1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:54.200]  and so this what happened and they have been trained uh to uh
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:59.400]  monetize and so they take the money from the immigrants
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:02.840]  they grab central south american middle eastern cuban
[1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:06.360]  you name an immigrants that make it to mexico
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:10.360]  and they demand a couple thousand dollars a piece when they catch them up
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:14.920]  at the texas border mexico or arizona border with mexico
[1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:18.840]  the new mexican border the californian border other borders
[1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:25.160]  with the united states and this is on record if you don't have the money in
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:27.640]  hand they line you up and shoot you in the back of the head including small
[1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:32.520]  children and you don't hear loraza or mecha
[1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:37.320]  talk about that because uh they are financed by the big tax-free foundations
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:41.480]  that run all of this and i've talked to a lot of uh
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:45.640]  mexicans from mexico i was at a family barbeque
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:48.840]  yesterday and there was a fellow from san diego who's hispanic
[1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:52.600]  who's from southern mexico but he he's been here all his life
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:56.680]  and he said no interior mexicans know what's going on
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:00.600]  uh but he said that uh he's talking to my dad actually i was listening
[1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:05.080]  he said that uh mainly it's the mexicans in texas
[1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:12.280]  arizona and california who work with the mexican mafia and los zetas
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:17.480]  and he said and and and so even after they come to the us they're used as
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:21.480]  slaves and he described
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:25.960]  some folks that he knew who basically had come in from mexico
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:30.520]  and who disappeared on the east side of austin and are used as mules
[1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:34.600]  as slaves and what they do is they basically hold these hispanic
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:38.200]  children and then they're used for as slaves for decades
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:43.000]  the austin police don't go over there that cps doesn't go over there i mean
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.640]  i mean they're constantly occasionally having bossed where there'll be
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:49.240]  hundreds of women as sex slaves and houses and
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:53.080]  children and dinecore and halibut are all involved
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:57.240]  dinecore runs the cps so they help run the slave kids out and
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:01.880]  basically i have to revise my analysis because i already knew this
[1:46:01.880 --> 1:46:06.200]  information but he just crystallized it for me
[1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:12.280]  some illegal aliens are above the law but only because
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:16.280]  they are property of the drug cartels and the cia and the banks
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:23.000]  to be fed on like t-bone stakes and so local cops aren't allowed to touch the
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:26.760]  mafia's goods and then i was talking to another
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:30.680]  family friend who was over there at my grandmother's birthday party
[1:46:30.680 --> 1:46:34.440]  at my parents who i've known for a long time and and she works for one of the
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:39.800]  largest apartment complexes and she had talked about how a few
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:43.560]  years ago they became secret
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:48.520]  uh government housing that is they're not supposed to tell their
[1:46:48.520 --> 1:46:53.160]  regular customers but they are now 501c3
[1:46:53.160 --> 1:46:56.920]  and that they are to give the illegal aliens
[1:46:56.920 --> 1:47:04.520]  with no id apartments and that uh the federal government is
[1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:08.600]  funding them to do this and then she started agreeing with the
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:11.560]  hispanic fellow who was at the birthday party
[1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:17.400]  about yeah she talked about a guy who uh works with her in the apartments he's
[1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:21.480]  been here for years and he's a legal guy from cuba
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:26.760]  and they got in this uh little fishing boat with a motor but halfway
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:29.800]  across the motor broke so they tried to paddle to florida
[1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:33.800]  and the currents caught them and pushed them in to central america
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:36.360]  and so they had to make it all the way up there were just a few miles from the
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:40.680]  texas border and the los zetas got them and took them
[1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:43.960]  and kept them for a few months until their family could secretly
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:49.800]  smuggle $2,000 a piece out to them then they still held them longer
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:52.840]  barely feeding them like something out of the road
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:57.400]  uh you know literally in a uh
[1:47:57.400 --> 1:48:04.200]  in an underground cellar and then he and his cuban buddy got across and
[1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:08.600]  the border patrol shook them down for money both illegal money
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:13.640]  and then legal bond and then once they were put in the jail cells
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:19.160]  they never got their bond back and and they were cuban i mean automatic
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:23.080]  refugee status to the us and they should get it because i mean i mean that is a
[1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:29.720]  horrible communist situation and once they got here
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:33.800]  then the jail guard came to him and said okay you've got the money
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:36.920]  so you're gonna get out but to your other cuban buddy you're not
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:41.480]  but i have the drug cartel guy who you already paid on the other side his
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:45.080]  operatives out here we're going to send you to austin
[1:48:45.080 --> 1:48:49.080]  and you're going to be a mule in east austin and the other cuban guy
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:54.040]  spent several years has never seen his buddy from cuba again
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:58.920]  so it's it's it's legalized slavery and what everyone was agreeing on
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:03.000]  is that the hispanic groups the ones the media gives the attention
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:07.080]  the ones that represent them the ones that put out movies about
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:13.880]  you know the hispanic hero that kills the evil gringos those type of people
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:18.200]  they are there to manage and racially control hispanics
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:21.720]  because they're there to be shaken down and i remember a former city council
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:27.320]  person their brother got busted a few years ago as a coyote
[1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:30.920]  for having a bunch of mexican slaves at his house
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:34.920]  because they quote couldn't pay him the money of course they can never pay the
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:38.120]  money it's just like the chinese mafia
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:42.120]  the chinese pay on average about 10 000 to be smuggled here in containers
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:47.160]  but once they get here they never get the money paid off
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:52.040]  it's the same thing with the russian mafia and so america is just completely
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:56.440]  mafia run and so it goes corporate chiefs they
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:00.840]  have the supreme rights then government bureaucrats and politicians
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:07.560]  then cops then illegal aliens then citizens and from my studies below
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:14.120]  them it's immigrants and they are sex slaves
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:18.440]  organs are stolen that's come out in the news their kids are taken
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:23.400]  just free reign on them and that's what i mean the truth is so much more complex
[1:50:23.400 --> 1:50:28.040]  than simple sound bites i just can't handle it anymore
[1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:32.280]  i mean to read about how they got these women and kids in these dungeons just
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:36.040]  like the movie the road and they're all running around in their naked starving
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:38.200]  to death and the and the and the and these
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:42.280]  los zetas people's funded by the cia rape the women and children for pleasure
[1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:45.720]  and enjoyment and then cut their heads off and stick them on poles
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:49.320]  and then mecha and la raza are all in with these people they're all mexican
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:52.600]  mafia run and they all think it's cute and funny and cover up what they're
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:56.280]  doing to them and instead make it a distraction about
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:51:01.000]  stupid cringos i mean we're just completely screwed i'm here to tell you
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:04.760]  attention this is a special alert to all americans who owe ten thousand dollars

[2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:20.520]  collapsed and is now collapsing the southwest and our country is going into a depression
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:30.920]  and i've got all this incredible financial news i haven't even gotten to yet and i'm overwhelmed
[2:09:30.920 --> 2:09:36.440]  as what's happening it's so much worse than what i can even say
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:43.560]  and then i watch these mainline republicans co-opting the liberty movement the awakening
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:49.640]  to big brother only so they can make fun of real researchers and limit the scale of people's
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:57.480]  realization of how much trouble we're in i mean look at this story state officials say devices will
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:03.080]  save staff time and money california officials are outfitting preschoolers and
[2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:11.240]  contra coaster county with tracking devices they said will save time and money the system was
[2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:17.640]  introduced uh tuesday when at the school students will wear a jersey that has a small radio frequency
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:23.080]  tag we reported this two weeks ago but here it is the tag will send signals to sensors that will keep
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:28.680]  track of children's whereabouts attendance and even whether they've eaten or not yeah everything
[2:10:28.680 --> 2:10:33.000]  you eat will be put on the tracking bracelet and then if your mommy didn't send the right amount of
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:37.880]  food you'll the child will be taken that was planned a long time ago school officials say it will free
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:43.720]  up teachers and administrators who previously had to note on paper files when a child was absent or
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:49.960]  had eaten yeah yeah just like people can't use regular arithmetic now with a pencil they have
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:55.000]  to have a calculator people can't think so now it's just going to be electronic prisons
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:00.680]  and the kids will be brought up into this school officials say it will free up teachers and
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:06.520]  administrators uh sung kim of the county's employment and human resources departments of
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:12.040]  the system could save thousands of hours of staff time and pay for itself then a year it
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:17.000]  cost $50,000 and was paid for by a federal grant and attracts the kids everywhere they are in real
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:21.320]  time and your cell phones already do that as well just this is the total prison system
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.720]  now i want to get into this first uh with
[2:11:27.720 --> 2:11:44.520]  of paul joseph wassen today and uh again i want to encourage listeners
[2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:48.920]  to get this information out to everyone they know
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:12:03.560]  know because we were able thanks to your action to get the vaccine inserts actually what came
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:09.240]  with the vaccine not what the nightly news said there's no mercury it's nutritious there's no
[2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:14.200]  health problems uh there is mercury but it helps your child's brain and this was all in the news
[2:12:14.200 --> 2:12:20.120]  we were able to get millions of people to read the insert and i did youtube videos on it
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:25.400]  they got millions of views and many other people have gone public since then the british medical
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:29.960]  journal the head of the e u commission wilf king wu darg the doctors and others
[2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:38.680]  conclusively proving that the vaccines
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:47.160]  not just the h1n1 but the polio shots all of it are tainted by design to cause serious
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:50.680]  neurological disorders geon beret
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:13:02.680]  ms narcolepsy chronic brain inflammation uh chronic convulsions epilepsy
[2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:06.120]  ms narcolepsy hundreds of neurological disorders
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:09.800]  luke erics
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:16.040]  they have different names for different types of neurological disorders but we've had brain
[2:13:16.040 --> 2:13:21.640]  surgeons scientists on to break down this is the main main cause the sodium fluoride helps the msg
[2:13:21.640 --> 2:13:30.440]  helps the mercury helps but you see neurological disorders off the charts you see young people
[2:13:30.440 --> 2:13:36.520]  getting Alzheimer's now you know we're talking 20 30 years old we see more and more people getting
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:45.320]  Parkinson's and it's it's all by design and you're gonna have to face that hard this is all about
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:14:00.040]  facing hard now they're back this year mixing the deadly h1n1 with the regular seasonal flu shot
[2:14:00.040 --> 2:14:04.840]  and here's the most important message that i can give you today and it's this
[2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:14.120]  last week we had several articles at prison planet dot com and info wars dot com documenting
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:20.120]  the fact from the Rockefeller foundation itself this is them saying it about themselves
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:25.240]  that they develop things to be added to vaccines to quietly sterilize you or reduce fertility
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:30.440]  it can't sterilize everybody or it's too noticeable so it's soft kill it's degenerative
[2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:37.240]  and we have of course countless other un u.s government documents club of Rome talking about
[2:14:37.240 --> 2:14:44.920]  it being done with other vaccines so clearly the violent responses from Gardasil h1n1 and others
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:51.720]  scientists and private firms have done tests and found a lot of RNA and other chemicals and things
[2:14:51.720 --> 2:14:56.280]  that have been added to those and you notice they said we want pregnant women particularly to take
[2:14:56.280 --> 2:15:02.520]  this we'd known with previous research that it massively increases brain damage in the fetuses
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:09.400]  in the women causes miscarriages low birth rates that's now in the british medical journal
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:16.200]  london telegraph ap roiders but still they don't care they're brazenly coming out pushing that
[2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:22.920]  everybody has got to take these shots and take them down and this isn't a radio show this isn't
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:27.640]  about your entertainment okay this is about a war against tyranny
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:37.640]  and the costs are so great
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:46.760]  and so we all have a responsibility and i'm going to create some flyers
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:51.400]  and i'm going to get them up hell we made a bunch we made them a year ago we never posted them
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:56.360]  i'm going to go find out during a break wine but we're going to post a whole bunch of different
[2:15:56.360 --> 2:16:02.440]  flyers if you want to make flyers that simply and succinctly expose the flu shots as deadly
[2:16:02.440 --> 2:16:05.880]  and have links at the bottom that into the mainstream news that admitted it
[2:16:05.880 --> 2:16:09.800]  that we'll post them on info wars and prison planet hopefully get them out to everybody
[2:16:10.520 --> 2:16:20.680]  but we have a chance to reach out even more this year and save young people and their
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:25.480]  mothers and their fathers from injecting them through fear the media hypes with these flu
[2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:31.160]  shots that they don't protect them from the flu and b are deadly and we know they're adding
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:38.040]  other junk to it vaccine deaths and injury skyrocket is cover up in plodes that's paul
[2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:43.960]  joseph watson's article and i'm asking you to get his article from prison planet dot com
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:51.160]  and get it out to everyone you know and i'm asking you to make the number one search term

[2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:41.400]  to believe but the stinking inserts say that have you seen the drug ads on tv for prozac or
[2:17:41.400 --> 2:17:47.000]  you name it it's like may cause heart attack may cause you to die may cause you to be impotent

[2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:43.880]  yeah i mean it's the revolt the global revolt against unsafe and dangerous vaccinations
[2:18:43.880 --> 2:18:52.280]  is um gathering pace there was a rasmus and poll last week uh which found that 52 percent of
[2:18:52.280 --> 2:18:59.080]  americans now were concerned about the safety of vaccines and that's way up on anything we've seen
[2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:04.600]  before for many years you know people who were concerned about vaccines were sidelined as uh
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:13.080]  kooks but now the majority of american citizens share these same concerns which is why um the
[2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:20.600]  pharmaceutical companies are in trouble and it's why um the government is paying for these pr firms
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:27.320]  to be set up that propagandize about how safe these vaccinations are um it's why you have people on
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:34.040]  the network news stations saying uh trust the government and get your damn vaccine because
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:40.760]  they're in trouble i mean as a result of the swine flu hoax being exposed not only after

[2:24:55.320 --> 2:25:00.520]  these people and then they're going to release biological plagues and give you the cure and

[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:11.880]  the good news is we're going to defeat them and then we're going to take our governments back
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:15.160]  and then we're going to get all the globalist documents and we're going to take them and
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:20.840]  we're going to put them in prison after a jury finds them guilty and those that are found guilty
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:26.520]  of murder are going to be executed i'm sick of you brain damaging kids and snickering with your

[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:53.800]  and injury skyrocket as cover-up implodes all over the world they're suspending the shots
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:59.080]  all over the world the rockerfeller foundation documents are coming out as the public is willing
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:07.080]  to face the horror we're going to bring these murderers to justice well that's right and
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:14.120]  this this article lists just the recent cases that have been in the news i mean to list every
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:19.480]  single case of vaccine injury and death in each country literally take an entire day
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:26.760]  but the most recent one comes from india um and this has appeared in numerous indian newspapers
[2:26:26.760 --> 2:26:34.120]  and it was a measles vaccination program in an indian village um they gave the children this
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:40.920]  vaccine the babies in fact they were um and instantly almost instantly after a minute
[2:26:42.040 --> 2:26:48.600]  of receiving this vaccine the babies start to convulse they start to foam from the mouth
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:56.920]  they start to collapse and um they died four children in india died directly as a result
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:06.040]  of this vaccine um the people of the village reacted by basically going on a rampage they
[2:27:06.040 --> 2:27:12.440]  abducted the health workers and the government doctors they held the government doctors hostage
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:17.080]  and they were eventually forced by the police to release them and that's because they hadn't
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:20.920]  been raking sodium fluoride from birth that's why americans used to be trying to take their
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:26.760]  kid for no reason would fight back they they submit because their IQ is upwards of 20 points lower
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:35.160]  and they're servile with chemical lobotomies exactly but now even in the uk you've got the
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:43.720]  mmr shot which for the first time um lawsuits are now admitting that it caused the damage that we
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:49.160]  now see you know 18 years after these babies had this shot then they're now teenagers in
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:55.240]  wheelchairs that can hardly talk and i see these people almost every time i go out somewhere you
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:28:02.600]  see uh children in wheelchairs they've got autism um babies you know 18 year old teenagers and now
[2:28:02.600 --> 2:28:08.040]  they're having to pay out compensation to these people that's right they're a year and a half old
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:14.200]  running giggling and their little onesy having fun and the doctors are just like and the child
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:21.000]  blood runs out their nose at night and then they're just like we ruined another one awesome give
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:31.480]  everybody more prozac more fluoride everybody's dying yeah yeah it's fun yeah i'm sorry wants
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:36.920]  him go ahead well yeah and it's not just the pharmaceutical companies that it's a blame
[2:28:36.920 --> 2:28:43.880]  uh for example in finland which you mentioned before where they had a 300 increase in narcolepsy
[2:28:43.880 --> 2:28:51.080]  which is a neurological disorder um it turned out that the doctors knew that this was happening but
[2:28:51.080 --> 2:28:55.880]  because it advanced their careers and they were paid off just like with a swine fleece no they love
[2:28:55.880 --> 2:29:01.320]  it they they enjoy it for each they had they love it none of them take it no they i'm learning
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:05.880]  more and more of these yuppies just giggle and go there are too many people and i'm like that's
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:12.760]  right and now it's time to cut your head off oh they're all eugenicists a lot of people would
[2:29:12.760 --> 2:29:17.960]  support sterilizing people through vaccines because that's how they've been brainwashed into accepting
[2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:25.400]  it but um yeah so there's a 300 increase in finland and sweden of this um neurological
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:31.720]  disorder narcolepsy mission completed they'll get more funding excellent job which if you've ever been
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:37.560]  around anyone with narcolepsy you know it says oh falling asleep involuntarily well it's a horrible
[2:29:37.560 --> 2:29:41.960]  disease it ruins your entire life they love that though then that makes your war to the state
[2:29:41.960 --> 2:29:47.400]  then they can get you in queue for the soft killing to begin stay there watson we'll continue

[2:32:02.920 --> 2:32:08.040]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:13.320]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:32:13.320 --> 2:32:18.280]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:23.480]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:28.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:32:28.680 --> 2:32:33.880]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[2:32:33.880 --> 2:32:38.360]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:43.000]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:47.320]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[2:33:08.520 --> 2:33:21.080]  worldwide it's alex jones see ladies and gentlemen i'm kind of a throwback like a cave man if i
[2:33:21.080 --> 2:33:26.600]  start reading hundreds of government documents and corporate documents where they openly talk about
[2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:33.240]  how they're drugging the food and water supply to dumb me down make me more manageable reduce my
[2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:37.800]  fertility and then i sit there and look at my children every morning and every evening sweet
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:44.840]  and good and innocent i start feeling very violent and i start getting outraged and then i control
[2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:51.800]  myself day after day week after week month after month year after year knowing a bunch of murdering
[2:33:51.800 --> 2:33:59.400]  scum or running the system and i get more and more tired of it and so i try to get up here and
[2:33:59.400 --> 2:34:05.960]  read the insert of what's in the vaccines see some people say well vaccines are wonder drugs
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:12.600]  vaccines have saved millions well number one that's a lie that's a lie if you look at the advent of
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:18.440]  hygiene in the western world from australia to europe to the united states around the 1920s
[2:34:19.320 --> 2:34:27.080]  massive increases in hygiene and indoor running water went in and less insects in the house bed
[2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:34.520]  bugs all that kind of stuff that the third world has we got rid of it and you see a massive decrease
[2:34:34.520 --> 2:34:42.120]  in many of the airborne diseases okay you can go look at these statistics then by the 40s
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:49.080]  vaccines come in and we actually see into the 20s disease goes down the graphs the same in every
[2:34:49.080 --> 2:34:55.240]  industrialized country it goes down disease goes down vaccines come back in the 40s and 50s and
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:34:59.400]  disease actually goes back up a little nothing compared to where it was
[2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:08.680]  so i'm not saying that in the science of vaccines there couldn't be some good
[2:35:08.680 --> 2:35:17.080]  good i'm not saying there isn't something to the science of you give somebody a little of a virus
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:24.120]  or a bacteria and then the body learns how to get an immunity to it okay that's like putting
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:28.840]  somebody when they're 10 years old in a boxing ring once a week you know at golden gloves or
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:33.320]  something and by the time they've been in it five years you know they know how to stand up for themselves
[2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:38.040]  instead of them just being thrown into a real fight in the street the first time and getting
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:45.080]  their you know their nose broken and their teeth knocked out but you cannot trust this scientific
[2:35:45.080 --> 2:35:50.120]  establishment to push these shots because they've shown they don't care what's in them or how
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:55.720]  contaminated they are in fact it's worse than that they knowingly contaminate them whether it's
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:36:02.360]  weaponized bird flu mixed in with the regular flu shots mainstream news or high levels of mercury
[2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:07.960]  or cancer viruses they're killing you now now watch and i'm gonna try to shut up because i've
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:13.000]  got other subjects i want to get into with you but this is so outrageous start going through
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:18.280]  the article that you and i put together vaccine deaths and injuries skyrocket is cover up in
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:27.080]  plodes walk through that uh for people right now well the first example is the one i mentioned
[2:36:27.080 --> 2:36:33.640]  before the break which is the indian children received a measles shot instantly died the villagers
[2:36:33.640 --> 2:36:40.680]  went on a rampage abducted the doctors the police managed to calm them down so that's that's a now
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.720]  see here when your kid dies the police come and arrest you and say that you beat their brains out
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:51.160]  because they've got blood on the brain and it turns out they knew all along the doctors that it was a
[2:36:51.160 --> 2:36:56.440]  autoimmune inflammation response but they don't care so the they don't just murder your kid or
[2:36:56.440 --> 2:37:01.320]  brain damage them then they get your other kids so see here in america they've got the psych warfare
[2:37:01.320 --> 2:37:07.560]  down they blame it on the mom and dad when they savage the child oh see they haven't learned how
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:15.400]  to murder their children properly in india i'm sorry go ahead right and then the second example
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:23.400]  is the 300 increase in narcolepsy uh in finland and sweden which came as a result of the swine
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:28.760]  flu shot being given to children as a result of that they've suspended all swine flu shots in
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:33.800]  finland and sweden americans are going to get it in their seasonal flu shot don't worry about that
[2:37:34.440 --> 2:37:42.280]  and then there is the swine flu hoax as a whole um wolf gog wudang the eu investigation
[2:37:42.280 --> 2:37:48.360]  proved that it was completely contrived concocted um between the pharmaceutical companies and the
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:54.120]  world health organization they knew it was a scam it was to make money the pharmaceutical
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:59.240]  company sold all the vaccines to the governments which you paid for with your tax money there's
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:05.560]  still batches of them piled up everywhere because half or more of the people refused to take it so
[2:38:05.560 --> 2:38:13.640]  now they're going to put it in your seasonal flu shot um then we have the case of poland the only
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:20.840]  sovereign state in the entire world to refuse the swine flu shot completely was poland um
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:25.960]  through their prime minister and their health minister why did they refuse the shot because
[2:38:25.960 --> 2:38:33.960]  just a year before they'd had a trial for a bird flu vaccine um on homeless people which killed 21
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:40.920]  of them so instantly they they threw out that was 21 out of one homeless center that was injected
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:46.920]  it was actually much higher one center yeah so poland rejected it um the check but why are they
[2:38:46.920 --> 2:38:53.080]  upset murdering people is loving you know i mean again this medical tyranny instead of
[2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:57.960]  nazis putting you in a pit and shooting you they shoot you with soft killed shots and like shut
[2:38:57.960 --> 2:39:03.800]  up kook take it haha don't get mad i'm your government i mean get away from us you murdering
[2:39:03.800 --> 2:39:10.200]  scum why see you i know who you are and i'm gonna rally humanity to smash your ass i'm sorry to
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:17.960]  talk like that i apologize i'm just sick of it i'm sick of them watson well you've got a you've
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:25.800]  got a white house sign czar who says we need a planetary regime that will sterilize people by
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:30.440]  force and this is a guy in the white house and i'm not supposed to get upset about that you're
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:34.680]  not supposed to get it and now we have all the rockefeller foundation documents about putting
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:41.480]  stuff in vaccines to secretly sterilize you from where their own website yeah that the um
[2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:49.880]  rockefeller foundation in 69 um developed anti fertility vaccines um and these were later
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:39:56.920]  distributed by the world health organization and the un population fund under their task force on
[2:39:56.920 --> 2:40:02.920]  vaccines for fertility regulation and by the way that tetanus shot is an added goodie uh just like
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:08.280]  when they brain damage your kid they then cps your others uh in africa in asia and latin america the
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:15.560]  added goodie uh with the female hormone carried by the tetanus uh pathogen uh this is mainstream
[2:40:15.560 --> 2:40:22.920]  news the un did this it it also causes the women to have shut down in their organs and and kills a
[2:40:22.920 --> 2:40:31.000]  lot of them as an added soft kill uh murdering women uh and we're not supposed to get upset we're
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:37.880]  supposed to bow down to glenn beck because he's going to save us paul well yeah that was that
[2:40:37.880 --> 2:40:44.920]  was in the 90s when the the whl got caught distributing this tetanus vaccines only to
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:49.960]  women and girls they were specific about that even though you know boys and men well that's
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:56.680]  feminist it's liberal they were helping the women only for the women and girls and it was
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:04.760]  contaminated with this this uh hcg hormone that just just by coincidence caused involuntary abortion
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:10.600]  and this is the organization that had sworn to distribute this anti fertility don't forget the
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:16.280]  extra goodie it then causes autoimmune responses uh in the ovaries and other areas and a lot of
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:26.200]  times kills the woman all right so the good it's liberal and don't forget fake hispanic groups
[2:41:26.200 --> 2:41:30.280]  that are really running the coyotes and drug dealing and putting the little mexican children
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:35.960]  and latin americans in slave cages and then murdering them it's liberal or like the liberals
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:41.640]  helping abort 51 of the blacks it's liberal and if you don't want to kill the blacks you're a
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:47.640]  you're a racist see paul you need to learn to murder blacks and everybody else and then you're
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:53.720]  a liberal you understand that watson no but i'm sure bill gates cares about the little black
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:59.800]  children in africa yes that's why he said during the ted conference earlier this year
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:05.880]  that through quote new vaccines they could lower the global population by 10 to 15 percent and
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:11.240]  then everyone giggled the yuppies paying thousands to be there that was their little pleasure their
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:16.840]  little enjoyment when they're looking at poor people as we're quietly killing them i've got power
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:25.160]  i'm a scumbag i'm running around soft killing everyone and everyone giggled it at bill gates
[2:42:25.160 --> 2:42:30.280]  up there going once we have these vaccines to reduce population they're like oh god
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:37.000]  we're joining in on the blood orgy we're powerful too but don't worry your master will smash you
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:42.920]  flatter in a pancake oh the good part is all you scum are gonna get it good from your own masters
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:47.400]  you're gonna love it i'm sorry go ahead watson i should i should i should be taking this is no
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:51.880]  big deal that they're no knowingly murdering millions of people i shouldn't be upset i'm
[2:42:51.880 --> 2:42:58.200]  the bad man i'm the bad man watson you're bad as well how dare you ask people to google the term
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:03.800]  vaccine deaths how bad how dare you warn them that worldwide this cover-ups imploding and we
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:10.440]  have all the documents linked in the story how dare you try to warn people well exactly i mean
[2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:16.200]  hasn't lebron james dunnell said something recently that's got to be more important but i mean yeah
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:21.640]  they've paid about what was it three thousand dollars just to attend this conference with bill
[2:43:21.640 --> 2:43:26.920]  gates so they charge people that because they know that only fellow members of the elite are
[2:43:26.920 --> 2:43:31.880]  going to pay that amount of money to listen to their leader bill gates who pledges you know
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:38.280]  ten billion dollars to um quote research and develop vaccines for the third world while at the
[2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:46.040]  same time saying that he's going to use vaccines to lower world population by 15 percent now how does
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:53.080]  lowering world population by 15 percent coordinate with a drive to improve people's
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:58.520]  health in the third world and then we're supposed to just roll our sleeves up and take the vaccines
[2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:06.680]  they're pushing on us paul yeah but everybody's refusing i mean six percent in france that's
[2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:12.520]  pathetic and as more people become educated about this which is why we're doing this today
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:19.320]  more people will refuse the vaccines um which is why 52 percent of americans now have concerns
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:25.320]  about vaccines but what what are they doing now as a result of that um putting them in the gm food
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:30.840]  you know vaccines in potatoes and things like that well that was my next point uh here it is
[2:44:30.840 --> 2:44:37.400]  gates foundation invest in monsanto oh they're they're helping monsanto develop more pharmacological
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:42.760]  crops because they know that we're refusing to take our shots so he's developing mosquitoes he
[2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:49.480]  releases to make you take your shots and and it's now going to be in you in the food juey because
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:55.080]  bill gates cares so much about you his dad the former head of planned parenthood known eugenicist
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:45:00.200]  aren't we lucky that he according to the times of london they have secret eugenics meetings
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:07.560]  discussing world government aren't we lucky to have them paul well yeah i mean
[2:45:08.200 --> 2:45:12.360]  you know they only care about helping people's health in the third world that's why they're
[2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:18.440]  trying to kill them um those two ideas don't connect really do they so i'm waiting for an
[2:45:18.440 --> 2:45:24.520]  explanation on that but yeah now you know statin drugs in junk food they're talking about they're
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:32.040]  putting talking about putting statin drugs in the water supply so it's about mass medication
[2:45:32.040 --> 2:45:37.880]  without consent that's what fluoride is um that's what these vaccines are that they're talking about
[2:45:37.880 --> 2:45:44.200]  putting in our you know scrumptious gm potatoes so now because people are refusing to take it
[2:45:44.200 --> 2:45:48.760]  and more and more numbers they're just going to do it without consent by putting it in our food
[2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:53.560]  and water oh it's just like drones it's just like being tracked by the cell phones it's just like the
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:58.680]  news going yeah all school children will wear RFID tags embedded in their clothes and it's
[2:45:58.680 --> 2:46:02.680]  meant to track 10 11 years ago i'd tell folks it was meant to track everybody because i had the
[2:46:02.680 --> 2:46:07.480]  pentagon zone declassified documents again laughed at now it's out in the open and then and we've
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:13.080]  got a fluoride head population here in europe and the united states who loves it they love
[2:46:13.080 --> 2:46:18.680]  being poisoned they love death and so you know i guess these parents just enjoy it paul
[2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:25.960]  paul but there's a good percentage that are waking up to it and resisting it
[2:46:25.960 --> 2:46:30.600]  which is why they're trying to take over the internet which segues into the other article
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:37.480]  that i wrote today about this um quote independent think tank if you look into it really it's a pr
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:44.520]  firm for the government um called demos and they put out a report saying that the government needs
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:53.160]  to infiltrate conspiracy websites because they need to restore trust in the government now you know
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:58.360]  why do people distrust the government because they've been caught habitually lying about everything
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:03.960]  under the sun and that's the same thing cast sunstein talks about and we've got the infiltration
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:10.360]  of the churches the corporations with infraguard the top secret usa spies your own private spy
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:15.800]  groups and now we should trust them infiltrating us paul because that's not creepy to have a
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:22.120]  government infiltrating no it's not illegal at all i mean co intel pro that was perfectly
[2:47:22.120 --> 2:47:30.760]  above board wasn't it but this was um put out by demos which was founded by marxists in 1993
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:37.800]  it originated out of a marxist media publication um some of these individuals then went on to become
[2:47:37.800 --> 2:47:45.400]  part of tony blair's government in 1997 and now the new conservative british prime minister david
[2:47:45.400 --> 2:47:52.440]  cameron is meeting with demos running projects with demos these admitted marxists uh who are now
[2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:58.120]  saying that the government needs to infiltrate conspiracy websites like ours to you know restore
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:03.240]  trust in the government now to restore trust in the government how about having the government
[2:48:03.240 --> 2:48:08.840]  tell us the truth ones in a while now let's notice you're you you're flip-flopped in england but the
[2:48:08.840 --> 2:48:17.160]  exact same system you had the quote liberal gordon brown uh after 14 years of blair and then brown
[2:48:17.160 --> 2:48:22.840]  so you were given the bill berg group fake conservative who accelerates carbon taxes
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:28.440]  pre-crime cameras cps grabbing your children cameras going in homes of people that have had
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:34.920]  newborn children worse than 1984 he's hooked in with common purpose all these globalist
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:41.240]  organizations so he's the right-wing savior from the liberal tyranny now we have obama
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:47.320]  the left-wing savior from the right-wing tyranny and now we're going to get our right-wing savior
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:53.800]  right about the time you get your next left-wing savior sorry go ahead exactly i mean that's the
[2:48:53.800 --> 2:49:00.280]  trick they tried to pull the problem with it is that cameron didn't even get you know a majority
[2:49:00.280 --> 2:49:06.040]  vote which is why they had to have this stupid punch and judy show with clegg and this coalition
[2:49:06.040 --> 2:49:13.240]  government but yeah cameron's meeting with demos just as blair did before him and um the woman who
[2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:20.360]  sits on the advisory board of demos is also the executive director of common purpose the group
[2:49:20.360 --> 2:49:27.720]  you just mentioned which as brian garish is exposed at cpxpose.com is this insidious network of
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:32.280]  individuals who have penetrated the british government to advance britain towards this new
[2:49:32.280 --> 2:49:39.160]  world order and these are the people saying that we need to quote modify our notion of freedom
[2:49:39.160 --> 2:49:44.360]  because freedom is misused and abused by terrorists yeah and that's the key to all they do they always
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:52.120]  say we're going to redefine society and we do the defining and so you being injected with something
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:59.080]  that brain damages you we call that a cognitive enhancer mercury brain damaging is what we want
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:04.840]  that's an enhancement see it's all lawyers speak and they're just assaulting us they're a pack of
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:11.800]  criminals using flim flam on us and separately we've got curtain emos article here justice

[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:23.400]  that you're an extremist if you like ron paul in the second amendment but you're a criminal
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:28.920]  terrorist paul now see they're the terrorists clearly people coming in and saying our freedom
[2:50:28.920 --> 2:50:36.440]  and our liberty is terrorism they're the terrorist paul oh yeah i mean this is precisely what this
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:41.880]  uk report says it says that people who put out conspiracy theories that is any viewpoint that
[2:50:41.880 --> 2:50:48.840]  disagrees with this lying government um is not only an extremist but also a recruiter and an
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:55.480]  enabler of terrorists so now if you disagree with the government who carried out seven seven
[2:50:55.480 --> 2:50:59.320]  and say that you know show all this evidence that they were involved and that makes you the

[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:18.600]  nothing to do with uh you know they soft pedal it as not a big problem but it's training children to
