[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  Alright, we're back live. There have been bombings in Morocco, Israel, and of course Saudi Arabia.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  The boogie man, the CIA creation, has been protected.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  Used to attack the Serbs, so they would strike back and destabilize that area.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  Used to go after the Russians, now being used against us to destabilize this country and Saudi Arabia and the world.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  So the globalists can come in and take over entire regions.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  And so there will be a war, so you'll be patriotic while they take your pension funds, take the benefits from the veterans.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]  Wholesale, destroy the economy, shut down the factories, drive down the dollar.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  It's amazing, and Dr. Dennis Cuddy is an author, a prolific author.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  Has several degrees and worked at a high level in the Department of Education.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  He'll tell us more about himself. I had him on a rear to show I did with him a few weeks ago Friday when I was out of town.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  And I wanted to have him back on. We didn't have time to take the calls we wanted to last time.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  There's so much to discuss. We're the New World Order, and I was impressed by his understanding of it.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  Dr. Cuddy, tell us a little bit about yourself, and I want to get your take on the dropping dollar, the bombings, and this escalation of crises worldwide.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  Okay. Regarding myself, many years ago, I think I was about to be groomed to be one of the, as I call them, power elite people,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  because I had a sort of inquisitive mind.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  The first governor's school, as they call it in the nation, funded by Carnegie at the time, was set up,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  and they asked us, I thought, a bunch of mysterious questions.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000]  They gave us the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and so later on I obtained the private correspondence between the tester
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  and what was called the Psychological Corporation of New York, and found out that they had wanted to keep tabs on us and files and whatever.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  And so I began a lot of inquiries, and doors that had been open to me suddenly started shutting.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  Nobody came out overtly and said, we've found out what you're up to and you're persona non grata.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  They don't work like that.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  They just, you know, doors start closing that hadn't been open.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]  So anyway, I got into graduate school, and one of the things that impressed me was the Muckrakers.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  We were reading them hundreds or so years ago, and I remember reading in everybody's magazine back in 1904,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  where this really investigative reporter, not like these phony ones today, would camp outside of the headquarters of the Rockefeller Building,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  and he would notice when John D. Rockefeller walks in the dorm and this polite opens the door.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  But when Henry Rogers, his second-in-command comes in, the guy really snaps to attention,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  because oftentimes there's sort of these behind-the-scenes people that are the real managers of, as we call it, the New World Order.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  And then the fellow, the investigator, digged and digged and found out that they had sort of almost secret meetings at 11 o'clock
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  on certain days where they made and broke up empires.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  He goes on and found out there were Rockefeller agents in every hamlet of every state of the nation,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  and what they would do is they would watch people at the low level, city council level and so on,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  and find out who was amenable, who would go along with their agenda,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  and then see to it those people got facilitated, moved up to letter.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  And then it became almost like a puzzle piecing together piece by piece.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  And so what I had done, you have to make a living at the time,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  I had been teaching a little bit at UNC Chapel Hill, American History, Political Science, the early courses,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  and then went up to the Federal Department of Education where I actually found out how this really worked in practice.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  It was like a battle every day between the bureaucrats, and it was a revolving door.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  When their people were in power, they would flood into the federal agencies,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  but then when somebody of a different party comes into power, they would go back to Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, whatever,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  and it was like this revolving door.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  And so I had done a lot of writing, got to know a lot of people around the country, and after I left,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  continued this research, digging and digging, and was able to get private papers, diaries,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  some of what Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor called the secret records of the power elite, I was able to get some of that.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  And so eventually I found out where one could get these key pieces to this missing puzzle and have tried to put it all together.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  What is the New World Order?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  I mean, what's its goals?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]  Well, there are different theories.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  My particular theory is that what they're using is a dialectical process over many,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  many years to eventually wind up with a synthesis of Eastern communism and Western capitalism into a world socialist government.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  What you have is our wealth is socialized, put into the government pot, then it's privatized into their hands.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  They set up a militarized police force.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  They blow out the economy, then we're all employed through the government, though,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  and the profits in control go to private select corporations that are not free market, but operate as organized crime syndicates.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]  Eventually they have what they would call intermediate stages.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  The intermediate stage between what you're saying and what was recently is what they would call public-private partnerships.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  They try and have these little steps in between so it's gradualistic, moving towards this, I guess you call it the new feudalism of the old days,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  gradually a sort of techno-feudal socialistic corporate fascism of the future, but there's these little stages they go through.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  This weekend, watching the globalists say a low dollar is good, let's drive down the value.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]  I remember the day of a special forum almost four years ago where they said they were going to plunge the dollar,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  but incrementally so that we didn't wake up to it, it was public.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]  Now they're doing it.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]  They're telling us it's so wonderful to have a weak dollar.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]  Your response to that?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]  Oh, sure.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  I mean, this is the same principle that JFK used when we had about 60 or so percent of the world's gold supply in the early 60s,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]  and he was very proud that he said he just practically gave away 20 percent, lowering us down to 40 percent of the world's gold supply
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  because that would provide other nations with the wherewithal to then go and purchase our goods.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]  That's not what was really happening.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  I know.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  They owned the third world countries and were transferring it to themselves.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  Yeah, and that's, well, I won't go into that.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  I remember telling you what happened to Colonel House's daughter when she sort of spilled the beans on that later,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  but it's always presented as such, and then what you have is what you also indicated, a crisis.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  It could be an economic crisis, whatever, and that allows them to further their agenda.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  You may have school shootings, and then they'll say, oh, my goodness, there's a crisis.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  We need to infringe more upon our Second Amendment rights.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  There's usually this crisis where there's a terrorist crisis or whatever to ultimately push the people into accepting what they want.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  Well, it must have been another show, Dr. Cuddy, because tell us about, I know about House's daughter, but we didn't discuss that.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  Tell us about Mandel House and tell us about that, the CFR structure, and tell us what happened to his daughter.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  Well, Edwin Mandel House had gone to school in Texas.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000]  In the middle 1800s, his father was practically the only one who came out making a lot of money out of the Civil War,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  and he was fairly well connected.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  He went over to England to school.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  British agent.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  Well, yeah, and his father, who both were British agents.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  And then when he came back, he was very agile at getting together with very key people through others,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  which set him up with Woodrow Wilson.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  He became his chief advisor, to make a long story short.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  In 1912, he wrote a book, Philip Drew Administrator, which was under a pseudonym.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]  But he in there said it was Karl Marx's socialism, socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx that he wanted.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  And then I believe it was Franklin Lane, the Secretary of the Interior under Wilson,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  said everything is coming about just like House wanted under Woodrow Wilson.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000]  I was able also, like I said, part of these secret records and all, to obtain unpublished material by House,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  where House, and I put this in my book, The Globalist, where House literally in his diary is writing that he's lied to Orlando,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  Clemenceau, the leaders of Europe toward the end of the Second World War,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  telling them that you can't do anything about these Bolsheviks and their revolution.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  And then House writes in his diary, says, of course, I really knew that we could have.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  One division could have put it all down.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  The point is, there's one man who allowed the Bolshevik revolution to spread when it could have been stopped.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  And therefore, had he not done that, you may not have had a Second World War or Vietnam, Korea, whatever.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  He changed the entire course of history.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]  A few years later, of course, he's very close to FDR, and FDR writes him saying to Colonel House,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  I've just talked to Jack Morgan, that's J.P. Morgan's son.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  Jack Morgan, who was very instrumental in setting up the CFR, part of House's inquiry group after the Second World War.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  And he says to House, he says, the real truth of the matter is, as you and I know,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  that a financial element in the larger centers has owned our government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  They speak very freely among themselves to this extent.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  Of course, he has a daughter.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  Later on, she's hooked up with the Rockefellers.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  And she says, according to reports, that they had been siphoning off the pure gold from Fort Knox,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  so that what you have there is now sort of a copper gold.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  And right after she let on that what they had done is got their European agents to buy up this gold,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  but really to keep control of it, she, quote, accidentally fell out of a six-story window of a building.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]  That's the way the story goes.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  And we've got, and I've got the newspaper articles on that.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  But the globalists are now public about their new world order, but, oh, we've got to have it to keep us safe from terrorists.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]  Just like, oh, we've got to have League of Nations to stop another World War I.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  We've got to have a U.N. to stop another World War II.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  For those that get confused between communism and fascism, it's all command and control, different flavors of it.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  The bankers created hit teams of revolutionaries they funded to bring down existing governments, good or bad,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  as puppets and then always funded and controlled them.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]  And they got a new type of neo-feudalism or serfdom that they, quote, put a window dressing on for the people
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]  using class envy to target the middle class.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  Is that an accurate summation of why the bankers, the richest people in the world, fund communism?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  Yeah, with a little additional.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]  Sorry, I think your phone may have just had a problem. Can you speak up?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  I don't know. I'm not sure what just happened.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  We'll try to fix it during the break. I think your phone may have gotten partially unplugged or something.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  Perhaps I'm losing audio. I'm not sure.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]  I'll tell you what, Dr. Cuddy, we'll fix it during the break. Stay right there, okay?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  Okay.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  Oh, you're a little bit better now.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  When we get back, we'll discuss that and real political paradigms that'll break that cookie cutter mold.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  And then I want to take calls. We've got John in Louisiana and others.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  A toll-free number to talk to, Dr. Dennis Cuddy, 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  And we'll get you up and on the air, so stay with me.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  And we have just updated Infowars.com if you want to visit it.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  See all the news articles we've posted if you want to be truly informed.
[00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:16.070]  Thanks for listening to the M2K talk archives and we are listener supported with the honors
[00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.070]  system.
[00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:23.710]  We ask that you wait don't donate a dollar at a time PayPal charges a 35 cent surcharge
[00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.070]  on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.530]  Wait till you listen to five or ten and then donate please.
[00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.770]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:06.730]  You were making some points doctor as we hit that last break please continue.
[00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:13.570]  Just following up with what you had said and wanted to add one additional point the public
[00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:20.250]  seems confused when one talks about the bankers and the communists but if the theory is that
[00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:25.090]  world socialist government is the goal what you got to remember is the bankers and you
[00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:30.010]  know transnational corporate heads and so forth actually love socialism if they can
[00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.930]  control the politicians they donate money to get their particular political candidates
[00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:39.530]  into office and then those candidates now the members of congress or whatever enact
[00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:45.890]  rules and regulations that prevent competition to those multinational corporations or banking
[00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:46.890]  regulations.
[00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.890]  Yeah it's crony capitalism with an army of thugs whether you call them fascists or communists
[00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.210]  they wear black uniforms they have snatch and grab operations there's giant prisons
[00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.210]  total surveillance.
[00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.170]  It's the same system it's a global web controlled by private central banks and then all the
[00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:06.730]  profits off of communism the socialism the fascism are funneled to them.
[00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.370]  Yeah the private central banks and the what are called international investment bankers
[00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:16.210]  the Lehman brothers Goldman Sachs those two.
[00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.730]  I know there's a lot of different facets and points to cover and what areas do you think
[00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.290]  we should get into to try to explain the new world order to people and to try to go
[00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:29.810]  over it and talk about the chinks in its armor I want to talk about some solutions.
[00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:38.290]  Well it's multi-faceted I'll move through some two or three examples and you just you
[00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.550]  know cut me off when the break comes.
[00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.730]  They have to control everything and so.
[00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.370]  Dr. Cuddy I'll ask you again are you on a headset?
[00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.370]  Nope.
[00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.290]  Any way you can boost your or get closer to your receiver?
[00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.010]  No I'm right in it.
[00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.370]  Okay all right go ahead.
[00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:01.770]  They want to control everything and so through foundations let's say the Rockefeller Foundation
[00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:08.670]  they set up a policy years ago 1933 to have social control of everybody.
[00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:16.010]  How that works is they would fund through Tavistock let's say in 1945 a implementation
[00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:21.610]  for human relations control and they developed theories such as social turbulence that people
[00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:27.950]  are confronted with crises they go into psychological retreat that sort of overall theme for social
[00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:28.950]  control.
[00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:36.330]  Then they have to get key people in key positions I'll give one older example and one new example.
[00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:44.330]  David Rockefeller is in the state of Wisconsin in the early 60s standing outside a college
[00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.690]  lunch line.
[00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.690]  What's he doing there?
[00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:52.450]  He's not got any business there but there he is along the hall comes a Wayne Peterson
[00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.490]  who most of your listeners probably haven't heard of.
[00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:01.610]  David says come on over here and gets joined Wayne to join the Peace Corps has him sit
[00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:06.930]  down to Brazil where he in effect constructs their social welfare state.
[00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:12.050]  By the time he gets back Wayne walks in his living room lo and behold there is Melvin
[00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:16.850]  Laird in his living room Secretary of Defense under Nixon.
[00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.810]  He says Laird says well we've got to get you a government position.
[00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.690]  He winds up putting Wayne more or less in charge of the Fulbright Scholarship Programs
[00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:30.610]  and by the early 80s Wayne is running around the country promoting Lord Maitreya who is
[00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.890]  supposed to be the second coming of Christ.
[00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:39.170]  This is a facilitation of key individuals and key positions.
[00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.490]  One last example let's take the Rhodes Scholars which is part of Cecil Rhodes' plan.
[00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:47.130]  I'll just give you one example of how this works.
[00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:53.690]  You downgrade the CIA's capabilities under Stansfield Turner during Carter's years Jimmy
[00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.730]  Carter's years Stansfield is a Rhodes Scholar CIA hit.
[00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:03.290]  Moving to Clinton you have Rhodes Scholar roommate Stove Talbot saying perhaps national
[00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.370]  sovereignty is not such a great idea after all.
[00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:11.330]  The President Clinton his Rhodes Scholar roommate makes him second in line in the State
[00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:18.050]  Department Stove gets an award from the World Federalist who won World Federal Government.
[00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:24.690]  Clinton writes a letter saying this is great you the WFA your President has worked for
[00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.930]  World Government he wishes them best wishes for future success.
[00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.650]  He then appoints Richard Gardner as Secretary I mean Ambassador to Spain.
[00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:38.610]  Gardner is the one Rhodes Scholar again who wrote the hard road to world order saying
[00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:42.170]  erode national sovereignty piece by piece.
[00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:47.650]  From Spain they all get together Clinton, Stove, Gardner and select Javier Solana to
[00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:53.730]  be the new he's the former Marxist now new political head of NATO.
[00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.810]  The military head of NATO is Wesley Clark another Rhodes Scholar.
[00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:04.850]  Wesley Clark under him his two commanders at Fort Hood they prepared the plan for the
[00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.770]  assault at Waco against the Branch Davidians had a mock up of there.
[00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.490]  So it's all part of social control having their minions everywhere all members of the
[00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.850]  same organizations stay there we'll come back and finish up with this start going to calls
[00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.250]  into many other facets in our study of the new world order.
[00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:31.889]  Here on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:19:02.120]  All right, folks, we're about halfway into the broadcast today, we have Dr. Dennis Cutts,
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:08.120]  written a whole bunch of powerful books exposing the new order all from what is provable.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.680]  But we can document there's a lot of quacks and kooks out there that on the other side putting
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.600]  out this info but this information is very very accurate we put up accurate information here as
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:24.760]  well before we go back to our guests and then to John and Umar and Ted and Kenny and many many
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:30.760]  others before we do that I want to remind the listeners that I have produced nine documentary
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:37.400]  films full length feature documentary films they are waking people up we're seeing 90%
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.160]  conversion rates for the folks that see the videos 90% of people that see them have tears
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.160]  in their eyes wake up because they've already seen so much of what we're covering they already
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:53.720]  knew about most of it now it's all been put down for them to see the master plan my new film is out
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.240]  it's two hours 37 minutes long it's really three films in one I suggest you watch it in three 50

[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:50.040]  suite 100 austin texas 78704 don't wait take action today dr cutty i got one more question
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:56.120]  for you i want to go to these loaded phones here all these callers and then we can continue with
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.520]  discussing other facets of the new world order because i respect your opinion and your deep
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:07.640]  research on this subject the new world order power structure we know there's a handful of families
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.200]  the rothschilds the rockefellers the dutch the british royal families the warbirds the krumps
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.040]  we know who owns the stock in the big private central banks that print the money and buy up
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.920]  the world with it we understand that we know they have the bilderberg group for northern and western
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.800]  europe we know they have the trilateral commission that's more economist here we know they have the
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:33.000]  cfr kind of a house of commons for the globalist low level with thousands of members in academia
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.600]  and banking and media and government coming together bringing us this new world order
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:45.320]  writing the policies all being enriched by the system a a society a colony organism of criminals
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.080]  and we know that these mechanisms work together and at the highest levels of the cfr trilateral
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:57.000]  commission bilderberg group committee of 300 you have the top people sharing all these groups and
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.200]  on the imf the world bank wto un xm bank oecd it's all the same group all the same people
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.120]  then we talked some about the mechanism of control we know how they recruit with road
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.760]  scholars and others to get the minions to fill the shoes later the psychological studies they
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.560]  do have college students high school students to pick the people they're going to have we understand
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.440]  this system we know how they use terror to scare us to accept this more about the structure the
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.200]  command and control system and some of the solutions that i want to go to the calls
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:35.000]  well through uh a series of i guess scotland and lennon talked about uh disunion for the
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000]  purpose of union you have to break down patriotism uh back in 1798 uh philip forno wrote uh at that
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.560]  time a sort of warning to the american revolutionary people of how the power elites would eventually
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:56.760]  come about destroying us taking us over and what you what you have is you create crises a war let's
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:04.680]  say during the 70s you you pull uh 20 to 29 year olds you find out during the vietnam period that
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:11.960]  patriotism is only important to about 25 of them this uh sends a signal uh that since patriotism
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:18.120]  is that important you you break down that particular loyalty and so the loyalty transfers
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:25.080]  somewhere else and to the extent that the plan was uh to get a world government you have a world
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.040]  economy and you do that by regional economic arrangements the interim step they all they
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.880]  always move in these little interim steps like spignaf brzezinski said we'll get to a world
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:39.080]  government but we'll do it by regions first and before that ceasar rhodes's fellow p.e corbett
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:45.960]  mapped out that plan you have these structures uh because there's a lot of egos out there and so at
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.640]  the top you'll have the bilderbergs as you said the trilaterals meaning japan europe and the u.s
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:59.080]  the top leaders they they function through key entities such as the bank for international
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.280]  settlements which will is like the bank over all the central banks of the world
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.280]  and they will set up certain policies which will increase decrease rates of interest
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:18.920]  investment opportunities then the the power structure moves through laws for example in 1980
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.280]  you had the repeal of the glass seagull act which allowed companies and transnational corporations
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:30.840]  to actually buy others for example deutsch bank of germany now owns a lot i mean a lot of u.s
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.120]  companies and corporations even though most people don't even know it uh agricultural ventures have
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:42.680]  been bought up by foreign uh corporations as well so you you have the economic control but still
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:49.320]  you've got a lot of these mid-level hot shots that you you have to assuage them and stroke them make
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:55.640]  them feel real important and so through things like the world economic forum you you allow them
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:02.360]  to have their input uh you have the un doing the same thing with its NGOs and INGOs international
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:08.840]  non-governmental organizations you use them the power structure as a lobbying mechanism
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:14.200]  within the various countries to change the laws to accept things like the you know world heritage
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:20.520]  sites and and various land control uh entities so it's the same way the feds send in change agents
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.000]  to go to a city council or school board meeting where people are fighting and changing things they
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.800]  go oh we want to hear what you have to say okay we heard what you want we're going to do it here's
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.520]  what you said it's really what the globalists wanted to begin with uh that's right they use
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:41.720]  facilitators to through various delphi techniques to do this and edward bernays who was hired by
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:48.120]  william palin in 1928 is his chief advisor with cbs wrote a book called propaganda and in that
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.600]  book he said we're like an invisible government we know how to manipulate you and at the end he says
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.240]  i was sort of like ross burrow he says uh we need a businessman politician type to say
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:04.520]  i must lead the people am i not their servant you know here's what you say you want and it's really
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:15.720]  facilitated please continue uh okay well the mechanism then has a upper tier a middle tier
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:22.200]  it has uh devices for political change uh economic change we've been through that the political
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.640]  change is hooked up with a social change and once again uh since you're in texas i'll use the texas
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:35.160]  example you have the industrial areas foundation uh Ernesto Cortez is down there he took over from
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.480]  Saul Alinsky who wrote a book called rules for radicals and then the first of it he says that
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.080]  we have an acknowledgement to lucifer and he really liked him and Hillary Clinton just loved
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.920]  Alinsky she wrote her senior uh thesis at Wellesley about Alinsky and Alinsky says what
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.880]  you do is you rub raw the resentments in the community you you foster this sort of class
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:01.800]  welfare and supposedly liberals controlled by the neocons bringing in the illegals creating
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:07.320]  liberation theology breeding that revolution uh in religion right and in terms of land you
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.360]  do it through the reconquista movement coming up through texas and into california and so on yes
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.880]  and tell them what the reconquista is uh that basically means reconquering they they believe
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.720]  that uh actually the entire southwest from california through new mexico arizona texas
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:30.280]  oklahoma is owned by mexico but it's it's washington and new york financing that part
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.080]  of regionalism to then break the country up uh that's right you you break down the borders and
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.800]  then you you unite them you various mechanisms you know to stop terrorism we have to have the
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:45.960]  exchanges you have uh university consortiums allowing degrees to be transferred from south
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.520]  of the border to they have these five congresses now between mexico the u.s and canada all the
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:57.240]  leaders together yeah and military coordination yeah uh help the whole the whole bit so what you
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:03.240]  have is it is usually driven by economics in other words you want to enlarge nafta you you do it that
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.640]  way and i don't tell you that nafta gets it's like that's how the eu started with trade deals
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.000]  they're really getting rid of our governments merging them but people don't even know that
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.880]  they think oh it's a trade deal uh yeah that's the way it's presented you you peel off various
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.880]  factions you you you give a little tidbit the tomato growers in florida to just get enough
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:26.440]  and then what you do is you fund you say well look at all these exports but they don't tell
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.600]  you really the exports are not finished products they go to these factories just south of the
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.840]  border where in effect mexico becomes a 51st state where you don't have to have labor and health and
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.800]  so forth regulations then the transnationals funnel those goods as finished products back
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:47.480]  into the u.s and people say oh well that's just to make money competition no they control
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.200]  the board game this is to lower our standard of living yeah get us degraded because the middle
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:59.720]  class is independent but a massive poor class isn't then you have massive uh social class envy
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:05.160]  that have the left wing to control that to focus it at the remaining middle class then the under
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.920]  classes liberalize they pass gun control they pass thought crime legislation it's the total takeover
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.800]  uh yeah it's a it's a total mechanism controlling they have to control everything
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:21.800]  uh it's like barry goldwater said uh the sort of example of trilateral in his book uh with no
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.520]  apologies he says there's not only political social and economic control they want ecclesiastical
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.120]  control as well because they know values is very important and i want to talk about the world
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.880]  council of churches and all these neocons and the rest of it but we've got a bunch of callers i want
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.600]  time to talk about solutions i want time to talk about uh your books and other information we got
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.160]  cut short last time and i did give the number out after you'd already left us for your books again
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.040]  but we'll do that i'm not sure how long we have with you how long can you stay with us dr cutty
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.520]  well let's finish this hour and see how my throat's going i had some throat surgery some
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:59.480]  time ago but we'll we'll see great i hope to keep you at least halfway into the next hour
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:05.800]  uh real quick some some solutions uh right now to this fight how do we resist this thing is it
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.120]  bottom line education people have to know there's this enemy destroying their freedoms first
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:17.480]  uh yeah and it's going to be hard unfortunately americans have been conditioned to to want quick
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.600]  fixes you know the sort of half hour tv show where the villains are conquered and everything
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.440]  becomes okay and you go back to eating your pizza and burgers and stuff but that's not going to work
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:34.680]  because it's not just that they are doing a particular thing to us they actually control
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.160]  the process if they were just you know if there was just say one superintendent in a particular
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:44.920]  town in texas that was wacky in terms of education uh that wouldn't be so hard but
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:50.360]  they control the process through colleges of education so your you know your whole credentialing
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:57.240]  and certification and all is they control the textbooks issuance all of it yeah so what you
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.880]  the only way i see it is a really determined grassroots movement that is here to stay not
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.080]  the 5 000 person rally in austin or something but a movement that's here to stay through letters to
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.200]  the editor listening to talk shows like yours communicating building slowly it's going to take
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.560]  time that you organize an opposition that they know isn't going to go away and that is going
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.840]  to affect their re-election or reappointment to some sort of uh local board only then needs to be
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:29.000]  a re-understanding a relearning of the bill of rights culture and at a cellular level in the
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.680]  community person to person understanding this matrix like grid of control and from that point
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.000]  on police and firemen and people in government realizing what's happening realizing what the
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.760]  new world order is and at least passively not going along look 99 plus percent of the police
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.800]  medical workers refused the smallpox shot that's a major victory right there now the globalist
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.840]  can't watch that attack for the total lockdown uh we're having a lot of victories i talked to
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.760]  police over the weekend who were at the event and of course colonel roberts is a police officer
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.600]  he says he uh you know goes and meets the police now he says about half of them don't know about
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:10.040]  the new world order and aren't going along with it so i i see a massive wake up happening it's
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:18.440]  just very quiet yeah i i would offer one cautionary note uh the the new world order crowd is always
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:25.000]  pretty good at anticipating what we're going to do and so what they try to do is uh demonize us
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:33.160]  by uh if we come along uh let's say like the student riot the student movement the 60s they
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:38.920]  come in and they say well here are 20 demands or whatever it is and what the new world order crowd
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:44.360]  will do is if we say there are these 20 things wrong they'll try and pick our weakest link
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:50.040]  and then demonize us and marginalize us so what i would advocate is then as let's say your small
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:55.480]  town in texas or whatever you would pick your one basic issue that you think there's a lot of
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.360]  public support for and that you can win on and then you do that once you've done that you gain
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.600]  credibility it'll be hard for the press to say these are a bunch of right-wing wackos and then
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:10.120]  you move forward rather than say all right here are 20 issues our 20 demands you might start with
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.400]  just one first to get credibility so that they don't listeners pick a movement you know the fight
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:20.440]  for property rights the fight for the second amendment is so that's right uh you know pick a
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.720]  sovereignty issue the open borders issue pick something fight on that and then inside those
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:30.760]  organizations we found at the grassroots level start the educational process on the other issues
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.640]  with the core group that's right that's exactly right all right let's go to some calls and we'll
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:42.360]  talk more about solutions john louisiana then umar ted kenny and others john you're on the air welcome
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:47.160]  yes good afternoon alex and dr cutty uh it might be worthwhile to mention that all
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:54.200]  paul woodrow wilson got wise to uh house in 1919 and severed all relations with him but
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.160]  great damage had been done to the country by then and then it got poisoned on that train
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:05.000]  yeah yeah great damage had been done by then and so all uh all house laid low until the democrats
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.280]  moved and took in the house took over the white house and then he moved as i understand it and
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:15.160]  remember he moved into the white house and lived into the in the white house and so he worked on
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:21.240]  all 50 or night and day i wanted to talk about the absurdity of a declining dollar but first
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:27.720]  the skull makers reported by joe uh scouser as saying that uh salem hussein has been moved and
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:37.880]  is it located now in the side of the united states other than one of the other john yes
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.120]  the evidence shows that he was probably taken out to russia it probably gave him the amnesty
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:47.080]  deal in the middle of the fight they could still try a double though so look out here in this
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:54.200]  running man system but you need to understand that uh what we need to do is stick to things
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:36:01.160]  we can absolutely prove dr cutting uh yeah it uh it could be that he was taken out to belarus or
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:08.279]  one of these other pre-arranged early on uh but uh like alex said uh we have it's not that that's
[00:36:08.279 --> 00:36:14.680]  not important it is important but uh you you have to watch for some distractions there's
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:20.600]  originally uh you have osama bin laden you know all focused on him then things aren't going so
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.040]  well then you switch to saddam okay now the post-war baghdad situation okay now it's the
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:31.240]  terrorist al-qaeda is attacking you you got to watch it be very careful not be distracted
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:36.840]  stay there everybody stay there good point though john we'll be right back with more calls
[00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.170]  you
[00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:00.610]  Waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:08.610]  crashing the lies and disinformation dr cutty john had wanted you to speak about the dollar a
[00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.770]  little bit more about that i mean to say that it's good for our economy especially when we've
[00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:18.130]  been so de-industrialized everybody knew it was a strong dollar was fiat but we can still buy a
[00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:23.970]  lot of stuff with it what does this do driving down the dollar uh well the globalists don't
[00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:29.810]  give a diddly about what uh happens here it's like you said a leveling process so if you drive
[00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:38.050]  down the dollar then it becomes better supposedly for foreign investors to to put their their money
[00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:45.810]  in here but our buying power is is less and so what you do is in furtherance of the global economy
[00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:52.850]  you sacrifice americans wages absolutely let's let's take some more calls umar in michigan you're

[00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:23.490]  with these gigantic mutant mutated cockroaches that's trying to kill 95 of the population
[00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:29.650]  it's all kind of i don't know whether you would call it proof or evidence or whatever
[00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:38.210]  that they were involved framed and funded al qaeda uh what kind of way can we immediately

[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.800]  6890 we have dr dennis cuddy an incredible author an incredible researcher and exposing
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.400]  the new world order for many years we've got a lot of callers want to talk to him we're
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:26.000]  about to go to ted and others but first off dr cuddy how do folks get your books what
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.640]  books do you recommend i've read several of them they're excellent well uh most of them
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:39.120]  can be obtained from toll free number 888-891-3300 that's 888-891-3300 and the reason i was glad
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:55.080]  you asked the listeners to your program who are sizable in number to have a pencil ready
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:02.080]  is even if you can't buy that book yourself uh you should at least uh the very least everybody
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:09.040]  listening can uh look at that book for free by simply asking your local public library
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.040]  to purchase it for you then you can check it out so it's important to jot that number
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.560]  down and among the books are the most recent just out it's called cover up and i want to
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:24.279]  give a brief comment about the relevance to that today it regards september 11th the war
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:30.480]  with iraq iraq and our vanishing constitutional rights before that was one called september
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.480]  eleventh prior knowledge prior to that is the globalist the power elite exposed the
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.960]  term alex has been using prior to that secret records revealed it's about cecil roads and
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.360]  road scholars and so on plan to take over the world and before that one call now is
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:51.160]  the dawning of the new age new world order which sort of encapsulates those two concepts
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:58.160]  when they were first uh brought to our attention and by the way there's going to be more chair
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.279]  i mean this is so convenient for him first bin laden got to get him and forget about
[00:45:02.279 --> 00:45:06.840]  him now it's saddam okay saddam's gone now bin laden's back all these convenient bombings
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.000]  legitimizing everything and it comes out the car law group on the company that got bombed
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.400]  and it turns out it was a quote l.a uh excuse me london times uh they're there saying that
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:22.759]  it was a quote c.i.e front i mean this is all this stinks to high heaven well there's
[00:45:22.759 --> 00:45:28.120]  a lot of uh like a my sort of subtitle on this latest book is about connecting the dots
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.960]  and two two quick points here uh what you just said the the quotes that you referred
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.320]  to london times and so forth there's a lot of these key people showing up at key places
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.920]  for example secretary of defense rumsfeld um has been talking about the axis of the
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:47.840]  evil and we've got to get tough on north korea and so on and what some of your uh listeners
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:53.680]  may not be aware of is that in 2000 uh the year 2000 he was on the uh board of azure
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:59.520]  based energy company a pb right which sold uh two light water nuclear reactors to north
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:05.480]  korea so you know to what extent to what extent are we going to hold rumsfeld accountable
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.840]  and quickly uh that hooks up with we were last caller where he's talking about no one
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:16.080]  pays or is accountable and then what you just said about uh distractions because whether
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.360]  it's uh if there's an educational problem will form this committee blah blah blah what
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.120]  they do is you have the 9 11 attack uh people start saying well why didn't you prevent it
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.800]  you fail to prevent it they say oh but now we've got this war on terrorism but that's
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.540]  occupying our time but now you find out just a week ago senator bob graham had the intelligence
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:39.740]  committee was uh saying on face the nation uh quote i think what they the administration
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:44.980]  are shooting at is to cover up the failures that occurred before september 11th bob cheaper
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:50.060]  says you're accusing them of a cover-up he says yes that's exactly right and when we
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.740]  get back from the break i'll tell you about my phone call the newsweek and that's what
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:58.180]  they do they roll us from crisis to crisis where we can't eat by the time we've exposed
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:03.380]  one thing they moved on to five others they've got us up against the ropes just slamming
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:08.220]  us and you got pearl running around giving speeches about how to make money off war you
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.779]  got you got cheney making all these billions off it's incredible
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:21.980]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:27.980]  harassing the lies and disinformation defending my family defending my country
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:32.299]  i know about the crimes of the globalists they're public thousands of them but they
[00:47:32.299 --> 00:47:36.299]  tell us they're the authorities and we shouldn't ask questions and they're going to run our lives
[00:47:36.299 --> 00:47:41.259]  i've seen note of that got dr cutty for another 20 minutes or so i know that uh
[00:47:41.259 --> 00:47:46.620]  he's uh his throat is he's just had surgery appreciate him coming on with us before we go
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:50.140]  any further let's give the number out for your books and let's give an address out or give
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:57.259]  websites out you forgot to do that last segment well the uh the number on the books was uh the
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:11.259]  toll-free number 888-891-3300 888-891-3300 and uh there's a couple of articles on worldnet daily
[00:48:11.259 --> 00:48:15.660]  if you just go on there there's a little box that does search you can type in the name cutty
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:29.259]  and also uh on www.newsnews.com they have a particular site on the left side that says
[00:48:29.259 --> 00:48:34.380]  new world order you click on there and additional articles and up will come and addendum to my new
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:40.860]  book cover-up that'll actually uh give most of the recent information what is that about 30 pages
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:47.660]  long uh yes about uh about that length is the what's uh been uncovered let's say during the
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:52.940]  last month or so plus additional stuff i'll put the semiramis with their seven rays i'll tell you
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:58.060]  you know the facts are and i'll say it and locals didn't have prior knowledge they carry 9-1-1 out
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.580]  there isn't a jury in the world that was honest if you showed them the evidence that wouldn't
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:07.980]  convict a globalist of it well uh that that leads me sort of into uh what i was saying just before
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:14.220]  the break and that is uh because i have been interested as you are in who knew what when and
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:19.900]  where i i was curious there there were a couple of newsweek articles right after september 11th
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:25.900]  the first one september 13th by michael hirsch and then uh two uh two other authors evan thomas
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:32.380]  the head of newsweek's washington bureau and mark hosenball on the 24th and so i call up hirsch and
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:38.300]  i say what about this report that these top pentagon officials the day before september 11th
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:42.700]  suddenly canceled their travel plans for the next morning for those that don't know before they got
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:50.460]  all their lines straight an early nsmec slash newsweek actually reported that uh yeah uh so i
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:55.259]  said the next morning because of security concerns to cancel it he says well uh what are you talking
[00:49:55.259 --> 00:49:59.259]  about so i you know reading from his own article he said oh yeah yeah yeah you want to talk to
[00:49:59.259 --> 00:50:04.060]  mark hosenball said you mean not evan thomas the head of the bureau no no mark hosenball
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:10.860]  so i call him up and he's not there leaving message at 6 35 he calls back uh on the uh
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:16.779]  8th of may and i asked him i said if he had found out who the top pentagon officials were he said
[00:50:16.779 --> 00:50:24.300]  no i said did you not ask who they were or did you ask kind of a big deal the day before
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:28.540]  they admit this and we have mayor willie brown in the san francisco chronicle saying i got a call
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:33.900]  home on the flight of new york that day the l the london times reported that salman rushi was banned
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:39.660]  from flying that month the u.s for his quote safety and that's just one small facet of this it's like
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:46.860]  uh bush being on anthrax i mean being on the cipro that fights anthrax uh at the time about
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:51.740]  four weeks before it shows up in boca rutan i mean these questions the media is not asking blaring
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.300]  red flag questions but what did he say go ahead okay uh he had said no and then i said did you
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:00.779]  not ask who they were or did you ask and they wouldn't tell you and he paused from it and said
[00:51:00.779 --> 00:51:07.420]  quote i don't want to talk about it anymore end quote so to me that was extremely revealing
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.740]  yeah the media could have said oh it was a mistake or we don't want to discuss you know
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:17.980]  no we don't want to talk about it or had he been told not to well you know i called lu caccioli up
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:22.380]  you know he's one of the firemen that said bombs were going off the explosions it turns out that
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:27.020]  the radios didn't malfunction in the towers turns out they told him to shut up new york daily news
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:31.500]  is reported they grabbed all the audio tapes and the video interviews they did they've been trying
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:36.380]  to you know class of all the whitewash hearings themselves and i call caccioli up and his wife
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.220]  goes look we're afraid we can't really talk i talked to him he goes look i can't talk to you
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.700]  i'm going to want to talk to anybody i mean our government's calling firefighters up and saying
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:53.100]  shut up uh reminds you of oklahoma city doesn't it yeah it it sure does did he sound scared i
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:52:00.779]  mean how did he say i don't want to talk about it uh nervous nervous like he wanted to cut it off
[00:52:00.779 --> 00:52:07.740]  right there you know that's just one point out of hundreds that are all documented like hijackers
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:13.420]  in many u.s military bases from monterey california to pensacola and they're being trained in all this
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:18.380]  stuff and then and then it comes out in the news they admit it there's no discussion or u.s troops
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.740]  massing in tajikistan uzbekistan tens of thousands of them are british or bush having launch orders
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:28.940]  for the war two days before on his desk or bush vacationing with the bin laden's or you know
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:34.380]  they're just there's thousands of points yeah and that also explains uh what i may have mentioned
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:41.340]  the last program it seems strange to me that back in 95 we were conducting uh military exercises uh
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:48.060]  with uh the soviets the russians pardon me uh not in leningrad or st petersburg or moscow but
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:56.700]  in tajikistan kazakhstan uh uzbekistan and so on until you realized that back in 1952 this uh world
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:01.100]  association of parliamentarians for world government actually developed a map which said
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:05.259]  when the new world order the world government would come about that's one of the places our
[00:53:05.259 --> 00:53:09.900]  troops would be policing and then brzezinski and i'm tired of plugging him please don't buy the book
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:15.180]  folks and then but grand chessboard you can read quotes in my book and i know in fettie's new book
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:20.060]  and you can go to the library and read it but please i'm i have to keep plugging in i've given
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:25.100]  the guy so much publicity the grand chessboard he's so evil founder of the trilateral commission
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:30.380]  says we need a pearl harbor event we need to be attacked lots of attacks this war for empire to
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:36.220]  unify the people for our new world order you've got the project for new american century uh saying
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:40.060]  that they're going to do all this we need a pearl harbor catastrophic event i mean we've got their
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:45.900]  own handbooks on how they're going to do it and didn't the uh peonac people say whenever they were
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:51.340]  asked if a war against iraq would cause the terrorist attack then they all say oh no it
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:57.259]  make it much safer for americans and then look at riad and casablanca well they're not going to stop
[00:53:57.259 --> 00:54:01.660]  i mean they need this to legitimize what they've done it's another smoke screen let's talk to ted
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:06.940]  in georgia yeah right on the air go ahead thanks for having me on dr cutty how do you spell your
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:17.660]  name uh c u d as in david d as in david y well c u d d y yes sir i say fine i was i think i
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:24.140]  like probably a lot of other people from hearing it would think it was tty uh that's the uh alcoholic
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:31.900]  beverage no that's not it well i'm not familiar with that uh i have i have several uh points but
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:39.740]  the most important one is the the fact that i believe that the um it's not a it's not a quick
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:47.340]  total fix but it's certainly a vulnerable point on achilles heel and that is the fact that the
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:57.020]  neoconservative movement uh has a pedigree uh going back to um leon trotsky he brought that
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:04.700]  up last time that's public um you've got uh uh crystal and he's up there as daddy's the trotsky
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.980]  that's public these guys are growing government going after our guns open borders supercomputers
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:16.620]  in china and the neocon whores on talk radio are worshipping this system dr cutting any comments
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:22.860]  uh the the origin of the the neocons of this particular element and they were the ones who and
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:27.420]  i mapped out before the strategy for getting by the way there was just an article about the neocons
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:34.300]  their their trouse guy up in chicago this uh guy left germany and saying he liked dictatorships
[00:55:35.259 --> 00:55:42.620]  uh well when you go back to trotsky uh well let me let me trotsky got an axe in his head in mexico
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:48.380]  because disagreeing with uh stalin what he had wanted was sort of the gramsian approach where
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.620]  you would attack the culture you wouldn't be so much a violent revolution but you'd change the
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:58.380]  consciousness of people but nevertheless it's still a dictatorship so ultimately that would
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:05.500]  be the goal yeah big brother absolutely anything else yes i would like to mention this i read
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:14.140]  recently a rather startling article that said that uh bolsheviks were excluded from the kgb back
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:23.180]  after 1977 and the 15 000 of them came to the united states i know that's speculative to me
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:29.420]  but i just wondered if uh dr cutty had any remarks on that uh well there have been various
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:35.340]  aspects uh to this uh and and let me let me further along what you said there's always
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:41.819]  been sort of a coordination and a and a getting along with various intelligence networks whether
[00:56:41.819 --> 00:56:49.420]  they're k gb types or whatever but before uh my time is up uh don't just look at this from the
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:55.420]  left uh the dialect the synthesis has to have the right end too so what you have is not only
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:00.620]  your operation paperclip type where you bring over the nazis but it's important to note i'll
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:07.340]  just give one example in 1944 sumner well a leading uh official the u.s wrote a book which
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:13.900]  was writing in 43 uh time for decision and in there he said the the right wing the nazis the
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:19.420]  german general staff had a plan to take over the world as long before they're defeated before hitler
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:25.420]  goes and it would come to fruition in around the 1990s and we're going to use mind science
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:31.500]  or propaganda to do it and look murderous people are at a premium so whether you're a kgb murdering
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:36.779]  thug or a nazi murdering thug the globalists have positions for you because they're having trouble
[00:57:36.779 --> 00:57:41.580]  finding all the truly real people they need and folks would be in a much worse position if they
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:45.819]  could have the evil folks they needed that's why they're saying torture and evil is good on the
[00:57:45.819 --> 00:57:51.180]  news trying to mutate the souls of the general public would you agree with that dr cutty uh sure
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:57.580]  the the and the the personnel is the key uh they would send underground to two successive countries
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:03.020]  individuals and so later you had kurt wall time the secretary general of the uh un and somebody
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:08.380]  named paul dickoff former nazi became head of inter paul what better way to keep up with people
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:15.420]  in texas and everywhere else yeah of all time ss gestapo officer running the un from 72 to 82 when
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.660]  it came out they protected him and all these liberals and all these minority groups think the
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:26.460]  un is going to help you yeah go ahead and take your vaccines they love you exactly it's it's

[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:08.220]  everything i'm not a catholic i'm not defending the vatican okay very corrupt but the point here
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:13.820]  is that they had wars then i mean look at what henry the eighth did they broke away there's
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.300]  certainly still agents in control you have different power blocks in fact uh dr cutty who
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:23.420]  would you say is the dominant force of the dominant clique that owns most of the stock in the private
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:31.980]  banks uh well uh there is it's tricky because there's a funneling mechanism a lot of people
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:38.620]  think it's british but if you if you go down deep there is uh some dutch money that actually
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:43.100]  helped found the bank of england oh yeah and then exactly that's what i the dutch
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:53.500]  pardon me sir is that where cromwell came in uh cromwell was in the middle 1600s and that's around
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:02:00.540]  the the bank of amsterdam's uh time and what they did is then after charles ii and james ii when
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:06.300]  they booted james ii out they the bank of amsterdam funded the establishment of the bank of england
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:12.220]  in the early 1690s and they quickly proceeded to get them in debt which was their key uh control
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:19.100]  mechanism dr cutty i am holding in my hand a chart of who in quotation marks owns the federal reserve
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:27.420]  i have no web yet but i will get a url but on the back page it says source federal reserve directors
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:34.620]  colon a study of corporate and banking influence staff report committee on banking
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:43.420]  currency and housing house of representatives 94th congress second session august of 76 it is drawn
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:48.940]  out beautifully it's all bar graph no i've seen it i've seen it it looks like a family tree so
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:56.460]  your opinion is on the predominant stock in our central bank my opinion uh sure but no we don't
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:02.140]  have to go off opinion we know who the families are but go ahead oh no i just wanted to add to
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:10.700]  this also that the imf is an agency of the un and that's that black's law six fed and also that
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:17.740]  new york is defined in the federal regulations as the united nations and when rudolph juliani
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:23.500]  stated on cpan that for the capital of the world uh yeah new york city was the capital of the world
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:31.660]  end quote he was correct and that is found at cfr chapter 111 dr cutty comments to what he's
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:37.660]  saying uh well even uh taking that one step further in terms of just uh biblical end times
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:42.779]  uh you know revelation 18 and uh what happens there and it has to be a port city and everybody
[01:03:42.779 --> 01:03:48.220]  says new york and everybody says well that was the world trade center i don't think though because
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:55.340]  when you get around verse 22 remember it says and a candle would be seen no more and that would be
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:04:04.460]  symbolic of the statue of liberty okay something may be coming up thank you very much amazing
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:10.700]  information let's talk to bob in texas bob you're on the air go ahead yes uh very good show today
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.980]  my question's a little bit off topic but i was wondering if either one of you happen to know
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:20.460]  what might have happened to bob chapman the gold expert uh no i don't no i i don't know okay we've
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.100]  had bob on as a guest but he's still writing his newsletters uh basically he's been criticizing the
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:30.140]  bankers and a little bit angry with him but go ahead okay that was that was my question you'd
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.540]  also mentioned on a farmer show something about when the new money came out we wouldn't be able
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.060]  to power up our margins with the old money or or something like that yeah that's gonna well
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.740]  the federal reserve has said they want to phase out the old green money issue the new colored
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.380]  money not issue as much of it so you physically can't pay the debt off while driving down the
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:51.420]  value of that new money and making the old green money worthless worldwide killing the dollar as a
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:57.180]  world reserve currency which they're now doing badmouthing it daily dr cut any comments uh yeah
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:02.860]  they must be following the australian colored uh money and uh unfortunately the way the australian
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:08.940]  economy went as well people say but they don't want to hurt the economy yes they do that's how
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:15.260]  they consolidate uh they yeah they do but uh it's a it's a sort of a managed thing there's i forget
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.820]  the name of that type they back in the under reagan's time or the end of reagan's time and
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:25.980]  bush's time they established sort of a a what they call a plummet protection team so they want to
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:30.940]  drive the stock market down but then they want to bring it to a halt to give their buddies a
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:35.180]  chance to get in at jack and apple said they want to plunge the dollar but incrementally we'll be
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:43.580]  right back we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:05:46.779 --> 01:05:47.740]  nuclear reactor
[01:05:48.110 --> 01:06:08.850]  Now I just want to bring up in our final minutes with Dr. Cuddy, current news items
[01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:09.850]  and his response to them.
[01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:10.850]  We'll tell you about his great books again before he leaves us.
[01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:19.850]  I first want to take a minute or two out to remind listeners that I produce award-winning,
[01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:27.850]  shocking, powerful, hard-hitting information warfare devices known as videotapes.
[01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:32.850]  And I've made nine of them and I've written a book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:34.850]  And the films are all over two hours long.
[01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:37.850]  Again, the key words, professionally produced.
[01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:43.850]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us a scientifically crafted global dictatorship
[01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:46.850]  sworn to enslave every man, woman and child.
[01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:51.850]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:56.850]  The events of September 11th marked the initiation of the final sick push by the Illuminati
[01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:01.850]  to consolidate their global One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet
[01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:06.850]  in over two and a half hours, two hours and 37 minutes to be exact.
[01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:11.850]  I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the globalists, their crimes.
[01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:16.850]  Learn the master plan for the bloodthirsty elite, the financially, physically and spiritually imprisoned
[01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:18.850]  not only America but the world.
[01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:23.850]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series
[01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:25.850]  and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:32.850]  This film documents the nightmare rise of the homeland security dictatorship, Patriot Acts 1 and 2,
[01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:38.850]  the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy
[01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:39.850]  and much more.
[01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:43.850]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism
[01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:50.850]  and how the globalists poses our saviors when in fact they are the terrorists.
[01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:55.850]  Now that's the back cover of Police State 3 Total Enslavement, my newest film.
[01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:57.850]  You're nuts if you don't get it.
[01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:04.850]  And it's $25.95. I've got also 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, two-part films, both over two hours long
[01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:09.850]  about who really carried out 9-1-1 and what their plan is and how to stop them.
[01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:14.850]  They're $20 apiece. When you get three or more, order the films today.
[01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.850]  Don't wait. Get the book as well.

[01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:48.850]  We outnumber the globalists 500 to 1.
[01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:54.850]  Again, that number, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:59.850]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:08.850]  That's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.850]  Take action. Make the call today.
[01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:14.850]  Hit the videos. Get the word out.
[01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.850]  Dr. Cuddy, one more time, your two newest books.
[01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:21.850]  You recommended how folks get those because I have read your prior knowledge book.
[01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:24.850]  I haven't gotten the new one, but tell folks how they get them.
[01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:31.850]  Well, the current one is cover-up, and you should be getting it any day now.
[01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:33.850]  I think I put it in the mail to you.
[01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:38.850]  It deals with September 11th, the war with Iraq, and a vanishing Constitutional rights.
[01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:44.850]  The toll-free number, 888-891-3300.
[01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:50.850]  And as I said, if somebody wants to read it for free, all they have to do is ask the local library to get it for them.
[01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:54.850]  Everybody should call and say, I want Dr. Dennis Cuddy's books in the library.
[01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:56.850]  I want Alex Jones's books.
[01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:57.850]  That's right.
[01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:59.850]  And tell them how to get them.
[01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:00.850]  I really do appreciate that.
[01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:02.850]  Now, I want to go over some news items with you.
[01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:07.850]  Again, U.S. stocks fall on soft dollar and weak retail sales.
[01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:10.850]  Reuters and it says, Snow says this is good.
[01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:14.850]  A new Treasury Secretary, a dropping dollar, and all this is real good.
[01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:16.850]  Just any other comments about the plunging dollar?
[01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:18.850]  It is a big deal.
[01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:25.850]  Yeah, and it is, like you said back about an hour ago, that it's a leveling process.
[01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:29.850]  You cannot have a one-nation dominant economy.
[01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:32.850]  The globalists are active in a world economy.
[01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:35.850]  They're going to use this to play them off against each other and control them.
[01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:36.850]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:40.850]  It's like rollerball where one country's energy and others' manufacturing,
[01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:43.850]  and they're all controlled by this global syndicate, this corporation.
[01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:45.850]  Yeah, because you're supposed to parcel it out.
[01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:51.850]  If you're going to have regional arrangements, then little country X has to have something it can produce.
[01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:56.850]  Therefore, you have to limit the U.S. or whatever other countries from producing that.
[01:10:56.850 --> 01:10:59.850]  If you're going to have this sort of network of trade working,
[01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:03.850]  and therefore you have to destroy certain industries in many countries.
[01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.850]  I understand the goal isn't trade.
[01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:08.850]  Trade is the gate to control is why they're doing this.
[01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:11.850]  Right, and even toward the back of my secret records reveal,
[01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:16.850]  I show how back 2,000 years ago that was the plan.
[01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:17.850]  Rome did this.
[01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:18.850]  Rome did this.
[01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:20.850]  They would only let certain areas produce certain things.
[01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:23.850]  I was rereading the Battle for Gaul written by Julius Caesar,
[01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:27.850]  and he talked about how he would only let certain tribes produce certain things.
[01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:31.850]  Right, and in the Middle East, if whoever controlled the via mares,
[01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:36.850]  that trade route where they had fortified Har Mageddon, that's the Armageddon,
[01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:38.850]  they would control the world.
[01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:40.850]  It's amazing.
[01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:47.850]  The White House press secretary, a greedy lying creature, has now resigned.
[01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.850]  What do you think about that?
[01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:51.850]  It's what you just said a half an hour ago.
[01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:55.850]  I think he's going to go make some money on the book tour and the speaking circuit.
[01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:59.850]  All right, so cashing in.
[01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:03.850]  Villagers versus oil giant Ashcroft to the rescue, Asian Times.
[01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:06.850]  It says in a move that provoked outrage from human rights groups here,
[01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:12.850]  U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft has asked the federal appeals court to nullify a 214-year-old law
[01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:18.850]  that has provided foreign victims of serious abuses access to U.S. courts for readiness for redress.
[01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:23.850]  They are now changing it where oil companies have gone in with their military troops and killed people.
[01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:25.850]  U.S. companies are protected.
[01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:27.850]  What do you think about that, or have you heard about it?
[01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:29.850]  No, I really haven't.
[01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:34.850]  Well, it gets into what they're doing.
[01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.850]  Ashcroft's Justice Department has, well, a friend of the court.
[01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:41.850]  Well, it would fit, though, because what they're doing,
[01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:44.850]  even our Supreme Court is saying we have to look to international law.
[01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:47.850]  So that's going to impact international law, which then will come back on us.
[01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:49.850]  Yeah, so everything's got to go to the U.N.
[01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:54.850]  And they've got an amicus brief on behalf of California-based oil giant Unicol
[01:12:54.850 --> 01:13:01.850]  in a civil case brought by the Miami's villagers who claim that the company responsible for serious abuses
[01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:05.850]  committed by Army troops provided security for a company project.
[01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:08.850]  You know, the oil company is going around slaughtering villagers.
[01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:11.850]  So they've got that.
[01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:19.850]  I also wanted to get into the psyops, the loves not manual, that's what it says.
[01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:25.850]  The U.S. Army is using Metallica and Barney theme song as instruments of coercion in Iraq.
[01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:31.850]  It says in these reeducation centers MSNBC says they blare satanic music with children's music
[01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:33.850]  to shock the Iraqis into submission.
[01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:35.850]  What does that sound like to you?
[01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:36.850]  Two things.
[01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:42.850]  They played You're No Good, You're No Good to Noriega outside the Vatican building in Panama.
[01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:50.850]  And then at Waco they blared the killing of Little Rabbit and Dancy Sinatra saying these boots are made for walking
[01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.850]  and there's going to be a fire.
[01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:54.850]  That's it.
[01:13:54.850 --> 01:14:00.850]  And it says the idea, says Sergeant Mark Hadsell, is to break a subject's resistance by annoying that person
[01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:04.850]  with what some Iraqis consider cultural offensive music.
[01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:10.850]  Songs that are being played include Van Diesel's XXX movie soundtrack and Metallica.
[01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:14.850]  And it says along with children's songs, well this is what they're doing to our people.
[01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:18.850]  Again, but they tell them it's fashionable, they run out and do it.
[01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:24.850]  Theodore Adorno as part of this whole scenario said fractious music could change the consciousness
[01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:29.850]  and he was part of the Frankfurt School to change America.
[01:14:29.850 --> 01:14:33.850]  And barbs aside, 9-1-1 questions aren't going away.
[01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:35.850]  Toronto Starved.
[01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:40.850]  And it comes out where the Bush is saying he's not going to release any of the records on 9-1-1 now.
[01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:43.850]  No whitewashes, not even with Kissinger.
[01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:46.850]  And there are some convenient bombings to distract us.
[01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:51.850]  Where do you see this going just where 85% of the public knows that they did it a few years from now,
[01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:54.850]  just like with Kennedy, but they still just ignore it?
[01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:58.850]  How are they going to get away with this because everybody's learning about this, Doctor?
[01:14:58.850 --> 01:15:02.850]  Well, the first step of course is what they're doing to the 9-1-1 report,
[01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:06.850]  which is classifying a lot of the material so you can't get at it.
[01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:09.850]  The second thing is they have to set precedents.
[01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:14.850]  And so you have Clinton with the Monica Lewinsky trial.
[01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:20.850]  And in effect everybody knows he commits perjury, but they've conditioned the American public
[01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:23.850]  so that two-thirds of them say we don't care as long as the economy is good.
[01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:27.850]  And so if enough time passes, people don't care that there was Operation Northwood,
[01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:32.850]  they don't care that JFK was fooling around, they don't care about anything.
[01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:37.850]  Well, I said many years ago, the last few years of Clinton in August, that he's a puppet.
[01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:39.850]  I'm not going to make my whole show about how he's a puppet.
[01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:41.850]  He's a minion. He's not running anything.
[01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:43.850]  He's meant to drag us to the mud.
[01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:48.850]  He's meant to get caught doing all of this to condition us, to acclimate us, to accept corruption.
[01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:50.850]  Yep. That's right.
[01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:56.850]  All right. Russia preparing for nuclear attacks on the U.S. and Britain, Newsmax reports.
[01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:03.850]  Russia will launch a mock nuclear attack against the U.S. and Britain during military exercises over the week.
[01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:06.850]  And they're supposedly our big buddies. What do you think of that?
[01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:10.850]  Once again, the plan was that if the communist threat were greatly evaded,
[01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:14.850]  the West would lose whatever incentive it had for world government, end quote.
[01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:18.850]  Lincoln, Bloomfield, CFR under the Rhodes Scholar, Dean Rusk in the early 60s.
[01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:25.850]  You have to keep this massive potential threat in the psyche of Americans to make them compliant.
[01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:28.850]  And that's why Clinton gives supercomputers to China. It's bad.
[01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.850]  Bush takes all the controls off. It's good.
[01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:34.850]  That's why you give reactors to North Korea. You've got to build up that threat.
[01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:36.850]  That's right.
[01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:39.850]  Here's another one. Big Brother tracking you without a warrant.
[01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:43.850]  James Banford in the New York Times admitting that we're totally surveilled by the Pentagon.
[01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.850]  The Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:49.850]  Isn't this a battle-chilling effect, though, because they don't have the personnel to go listen to all that
[01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:52.850]  or do anything with it, even with keyword software.
[01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:58.850]  Isn't announcing we're being surveilled about creating a chilling effect, isn't that part of it?
[01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:05.850]  Sure. The psychological impact is probably more important than iridium or echelon,
[01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:09.850]  finding out if you used the word bomb at some point.
[01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:13.850]  Yeah. And imagine billions of phone calls, billions of Fox's emails.
[01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:18.850]  Even with keyword stuff, it's like coming home and having 10,000 phone messages a day.
[01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:22.850]  Even if you could listen to them, they can't track it down. They can't do anything with it.
[01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:26.850]  They're telling you they're spying on you while leaving the borders open to train you,
[01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:28.850]  except not having a Fourth Amendment.
[01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:31.850]  Yeah, but they will also get a little bit bolder.
[01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:37.850]  You may eventually have two-way television viewing in your home and so forth, unbeknownst to you.
[01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:42.850]  Well, hold on. Did you know that the new AMBER Alert System is really the FEMA EAS takeover system?
[01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:46.850]  I've had the FCC on about this years ago.
[01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:49.850]  And the new digital cable boxes don't watch you physically.
[01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:54.850]  They create digital psychological algorithm databases, very detailed,
[01:17:54.850 --> 01:18:00.850]  a lot more than that psychological test they did for you in the Globalist, off your viewing habits.
[01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:05.850]  So did you know the digital cable boxes are already literally watching your mind?
[01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:13.850]  At the very least, as I said, back in the mid-'70s, they could alter your brainwaves remotely.
[01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:17.850]  Most people think that you have to plan electrodes. No, no, remotely they can alter.
[01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:20.850]  Well, that was patented in 1954.
[01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:22.850]  I think it's in the mid-'70s.
[01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:28.850]  Well, there was a device that could project audio into the head. In 1954 it was patented.
[01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:33.850]  Okay, that one. But remote by satellite, they can alter your brainwaves.
[01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:39.850]  Sure. Now, I have the guy on who was an MSNBC last year, the CEO. They're already going in.
[01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:43.850]  What about the book machines that beam an audio beam into your mind? Have you heard about that?
[01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:45.850]  No.
[01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:47.850]  Those are going to be in stores very soon.
[01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:52.850]  Well, prior to that, like I said, they're always a step-by-step process.
[01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:58.850]  I may have mentioned it before, there's a psychological meaning behind the new ads.
[01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:02.850]  Rather than your cognitive, here are the five reasons to buy Nike or whatever,
[01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:07.850]  they create an image of flashing lights, swirling motions that are not ordinarily seen
[01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:11.850]  and it changes from thinking to just receiving.
[01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:17.850]  So you're receiving constantly during a 30-second commercial images of a particular product,
[01:19:17.850 --> 01:19:24.850]  not just once on your mind, but many times, so that your mind, when you come to buy sneakers, will buy that product.
[01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:30.850]  Switching off the thinking process, by being conscious of it, that's a big part of the battle, isn't it?
[01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:38.850]  Yeah, and the Hindus, thousands of years ago, used fast flickering candles for the same hypnotic effect.
[01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:45.850]  Well, that's where you get the flashing scrub light out of the swinging watch to get somebody lulled into a subconscious state.
[01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:53.850]  Yeah, and it's really for our own good, according to the current show called The Agency.
[01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:55.850]  You may have seen it about the CIA.
[01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:59.850]  Yeah, torture is good, mind control through TV is good, this is all good for us.
[01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:03.850]  The fellow on there is a Mr. Quinn, the bald-headed guy.
[01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:11.850]  Well, back in 1980, there was a movie called The Agency, and the guy's name was Mr. Quinn, played by, I think, Robert Mitchum.
[01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:17.850]  And he says, oh yeah, the people want to be controlled, they want to be manipulated, and here's how we're going to psychologically do it.
[01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:19.850]  Well, in your face.
[01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:26.850]  Bilderberg convenes in Versailles, the annual meeting of the global elite kicked off mid-May in secrecy.
[01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:36.850]  However, two resourceful AFP correspondents were there to greet them, unveiling the world, what goes on behind closed doors when the world's most powerful meat discuss pressing issues of the day.
[01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:45.850]  Tucker said on my show in January of last year, he said he was getting it from inside their meetings, that there would be an attack in mid-February or into March.
[01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:51.850]  He said it wouldn't be in 2002, like the media was saying, that was accurate, he's been very accurate in the past.
[01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:59.850]  He's saying the rift between America and European Bilderberg participants is widening over both the U.S. invasion of Iraq and blind, blank check support of Israel's aggression against Palestinians.
[01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:04.850]  See, I don't really, Tucker saying that, I think, you know, that's all just surface stuff.
[01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:12.850]  These are hotly debated topics at Bilderberg, luminaries being filling the posh Palace Hotel May 14.
[01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:20.850]  Another issue, how Bilderberg agendas propose European Union Army independent of NATO, unlike the other two major issues, is not a confrontation between Americans and Europeans.
[01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:29.850]  All Americans oppose EU Army, but so do many Europeans, leading in the anti-Army Euro faction is Lord George Robertson, Secretary General of NATO.
[01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:30.850]  What do you think about that?
[01:21:30.850 --> 01:21:43.850]  Yeah, Robertson is, and Sutherland, in fact Sutherland is one that was with Rumsfeld as part of the board of that ABB, selling the nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:47.850]  So they have their people going all over the place over the years.
[01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:51.850]  Robert Mueller was Assistant Secretary General of the UN.
[01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:52.850]  What's he doing?
[01:21:52.850 --> 01:22:02.850]  Now he's set up not only the University of Peace, but many schools around the country, including Arlington, Texas, based on Alice Bailey's teachings, first published by Lucifer.
[01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:09.850]  And so there are these key individuals, whether it's Robertson or Gro Harlem, Brooklyn.
[01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:17.850]  And by the way, every time you track them back, they're not Germans, they're not Jews, they're not Chinese, they're Luciferian Satanists.
[01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:20.850]  This is public information.
[01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:27.850]  How do they, I mean this has even been in the news, MSNBC and then USA Today admit, oh yeah, they do occult rituals.
[01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:31.850]  How do they get away with doing that and calling themselves Christian conservatives?
[01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:34.850]  Because the public lets them.
[01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:36.850]  Well, that's not really entirely true.
[01:22:36.850 --> 01:22:51.850]  The public has been conditioned, but there was a process to get us to this stage, like the fog and the boiling water gradually put to a particular temperature so you don't notice it until it's too late.
[01:22:51.850 --> 01:23:01.850]  So what they do is, as I said, Cecil Rhodes not only wanted economic, educational and political control, but journalism as well.
[01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:12.850]  So through the media outlets, through Edward Bernays and CBS, whatever, they actually control, as one of the people investigating this, not only what you are told, but what you are not told.
[01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:17.850]  Now that's a big way they lie to us is by giving you only part of the story.
[01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:18.850]  Right.
[01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:19.850]  All right.
[01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:22.850]  Well, Dr. Cuddy, I really appreciate you coming on the show today.
[01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:23.850]  And Godspeed.
[01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:24.850]  And I appreciate all the time.
[01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:27.850]  And we look forward to having you back on in the future.
[01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:28.850]  Okay, thanks for having me.
[01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:29.850]  Take care.
[01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:30.850]  Final segment.
[01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:32.850]  I've got a little news blitz for you.
[01:23:32.850 --> 01:23:35.850]  About 10 stories I'm going to hit on real quick.
[01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:40.850]  Wrap up this live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:41.850]  Stay with me.
[01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:42.850]  Stay the course.
[01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:43.850]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:49.850]  Websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:50.850]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:51.850]  Stay with me.
