[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]  Let's now go to our guest, and I tell you, he just breaks news story after news story on a daily basis.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  He's becoming, frankly, the most prolific writer on the web right now.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  He has just exploded out of the gates.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]  He's been writing for years, but he's really on target.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  And just joining us again, Greg, thanks for coming on.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  Hey, thanks, Alex. Thanks for the introduction.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000]  Oh, you bet. Let's just start off with former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, then let's go into one of the janitors.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  And I've called some of these people in the years past who reported bombs.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  They've said, I've been told to shut up firefighters, workers, others.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]  I interviewed people at Ground Zero who said, cops said, get back, the building's coming down.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  But, Doug, let's get into Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  Well, you know, Paul Craig Roberts is a very, very interesting man, a very intelligent man, a person that I enjoy talking to and basically enlighten me about his feelings.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  Now, his interesting story is, I believe, and he said to me this, he said, Greg, you know, why don't you look at all these Republican defections?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  You know, that's a great story.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  There's a lot of people like me who are influential in the government who have just basically been either shunned in Washington by the neocons
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  or basically kicked out.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  And Paul's a great example.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  I mean, listen to his story.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]  He was back in the old days with Reagan.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  He was a Businessweek writer and also an assistant editor for Wall Street Journal, and many of his articles were hated by the liberals.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  So Paul, over the years, basically started his own syndicate and column, which is very anti-Bush and very anti-Neocon.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  And he basically tells me it's very difficult to get anything published in the mainstream.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  Even Paul, I mean, can't get things contrary to the administration or contrary to Bush.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  Well, I mean, that's the point.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  Even so-called liberal papers will only publish stupid, shallow, fake liberal arguments against Bush.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  They'll never let somebody come in with the real arguments.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  Yeah, and Paul is a person whose opinions are respected.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  I mean, he knows people in the business and was basically hated by the liberals way back when.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  And now, I mean, look at the irony of the situation.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  And when you have him on in the next hour, he'll be able to explain it better than me.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  All I can say is basically he's a very interesting person.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  I love talking to him.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  He's got some great views.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  It's just a shame that his views can't be heard by the heartland of America.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  Well, in your article, you quote him and he talks about how I've never changed.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  I'm still a conservative.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  The Neocons are the opposite.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  And I've told real liberals, real Democrats that love big government and all this, I've said you should love George Bush.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  I mean, the biggest government ever, expanding all these welfare programs that are really just corporate welfare to control our lives.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  I mean, Ron Paul gave that speech two years ago called Neocon, where he laid out how the Fourth International, the Trotskyites, literally the head of the Fourth International, founded Neoconism.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  And the other guy, Leon Strauss out of Chicago at the Economics University, I mean, he's an adherent of fascism.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the real story and basically, you know, kind of so people understand, you know, what's going on.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:42.000]  My background, years ago, when I was an editor of my college newspaper, and I should have, we had to start another one because the college newspaper was funded by the university and the Ombudsman kind of controlled stories.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  My whole idea back then, even then, was just instinctive.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  You know, I wanted to get the voices of people that never get heard into the newspaper, and I did that at my college.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  And basically, it accelerated my graduation when I discovered that the college president was using funds from the university to build this mansion.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  So back then, nothing's changed for me.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  I've always been the same.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  Stories of interest are those that never get in the paper.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:22.000]  And so when you have a nose for news, years ago I got out of journalism and 9-11 kind of pulled me back into it because basically I said, you know something, this is needed.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  People need to see something in the newspaper by a writer who knows how to write for the newspapers, knows their style, knows what they want, but you can't get it in.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  So basically, I just started doing it the only way I could.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  It's pulled me away from most everything in my life, and I think it's a worthwhile cause.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  And I'm not going to stop until all these people like Rodriguez are heard.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  By the way, we're going to get into him in a second.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  You also write for American Free Press and a bunch of other prominent alternative publications.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  Let's get in to one of the heroes of 9-11.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  And I'd heard his name before, but I could never get a hold of these individuals.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  How you got a hold of the maintenance man, Janitor William Rodriguez, who reported on explosions coming from below.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  And he's not, literally folks, there's hundreds that reported this, but he's one of the folks that's willing to go public.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  Tell us about this guy.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  Well, let me tell you about William.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  He's very sincere, and he's very credible.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  And the reason I say that is when William is kind of, throughout the years, he's been approached by many people, including news reporters from the biggers, from the mainstream,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  who've kind of hinted, William, you know, you better keep quiet about this because you don't know who you're dealing with.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  And William told me, and I'm sure he'll tell you the same thing, that he's never varied his story from day one, when the planes hit.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  And he looks them in the eye and says, you know, I have nothing to lose.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  I should probably be dead now, and I am now the voice of 200 of my friends who died.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  And all I want to do is get the truth out.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000]  Well, William has not been able to do that here in America, and I can tell you exactly what happened.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]  Well, I'll tell you a story.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  Lou Cacioli, a 50-plus-year-old senior firefighter, head of a whole ladder, he told People magazine that clearly bombs were going off when he was trapped in there before they collapsed.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  And then I called, talked to his wife, briefly talked to him, and he just said, look, I've been told to shut up.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  I'm not doing interviews.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  Exactly.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]  So it's the same M.O. over and over again.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  Oh, yeah.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]  But listen, let me just talk specifically about William.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]  Now, let's talk about his story.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  He's coming on in 20 minutes.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  What's that?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  Of course, Mr. Rodriguez will be joining us in 20 minutes, but tell us his story.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]  Yeah, you know, I'll tell you, and he can talk about it also.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  But let me tell you how I heard about William.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  He's a lead plaintiff in a RICO lawsuit filed in Philadelphia last November.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  That's by Attorney Phil Berg.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  Recently, the case, the government made a motion to dismiss.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  The judge ruled against the government.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  The case is now being moved to New York, a change of venue.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  And the case goes on, a legal discovery.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  Well, William, I've written about, talked to Phil about William since last November
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  when the lawsuit hit.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  And I never really pushed the subject of really forcing William to go forward.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  He spends a lot of time in New York getting a story across.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  And so I just let the story progress.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  And in several stories of mine, you'll see I refer to William's name and what he, the
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]  comments he made to Phil.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  However, in a recent story I ran, William contacted me and asked me if I'd like to speak
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  about it.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  And I asked him, you know, can I talk to you?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]  So we began speaking on the phone.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  And what came of this to me, when I got off the phone, I said, my God, why would NBC News,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  why would all these other news agencies, this isn't a news story.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  I mean, if you're a journalist three years ago trying to get this story out, you're not
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  going out on a journalistic limb.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  Because let me tell you why.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  William, I thought maybe William just heard explosions, but William came to work late.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  He goes down into his, instead of being up above where he normally would be, he came
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  to work late.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]  He was down below in sub-level one in an office with 14 people.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  Now, when the bomb went off under his feet, he said he felt the floor shaking, the walls
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  around him cracking.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]  And of course, all these 14 people were frightened.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  Seconds later, he hears an explosion from way above.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  Not knowing it's an airplane, he doesn't know what it is.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  However, immediately after that, a man by the name of Felipe David comes running in,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  burnt to a crisp, skin hanging from his arms and his hands, his face completely burnt,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  screaming explosion, explosion, explosion.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  So for those that don't understand, there's an explosion right before, is what I'm getting,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  right before the plane even hits.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  They're down in the basement.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]  Right, they hear that explosion from below.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]  Totally far away from where any fire or the plane hitting 70-something stories up could
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  hurt them.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  Again, impossible.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  This guy's got skin hanging off.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  He's been in an explosion.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  Well, let me tell you where David was at.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  David was at an elevator shaft, a freight elevator shaft, about 300 or 400 feet away,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  and the flames came shooting up and burnt him to a crisp.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  He runs to the nearest office, and 14 people witness this, witness Rodriguez.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  Ben takes him out.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  Where is the fellow you just mentioned?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  Well, here's the story, and this is what William says.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  Let me explain this really quickly.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]  Right after 9-11, a lot of stories appeared.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  A couple of the comments, William's story I think got in some places just quickly.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  But see, what happened was, everything was forgotten about then.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  A lot of these people who were talking then, three years later, are difficult to find.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  I have a bunch of phone numbers, and most of the numbers are disconnected from the people.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  It's going to take getting out there and finding them, and William has trouble finding some of them.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  No, no, right after 9-11, I called quite a few of these people.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  I probably got ahold of about five different people, two of them firefighters,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  and they just said, look, we've been told to shut up.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  That was universal.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]  Exactly.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  And, you know, during that time, there was a different atmosphere,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  and the atmosphere basically was one of fear.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  Worship the government, believe the story.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]  Sure.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  Nobody knew.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  But years later, what happened, though, was interesting.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  As we move this story along, which never really gets covered thoroughly in the press,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  we get to the 9-11 Commission.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  Now, as you know, the 9-11 Commission has ignored many people's comments,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]  many even of the victims and the people involved, when they come to their scientific conclusions.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  And I put that word, scientific conclusions, in quotes,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  because what there basically happened here, Rodriguez also was very forthright
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]  and wanted to talk to the 9-11 Commission, wanted to talk to the FBI, and he'll explain this.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  Well, anyway, I believe the 9-11 Commission, I've talked to other people who, for example,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  have found the black boxes, things like that, that were totally ignored,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  but I think because of Rodriguez's position, because of what he did on 9-11,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  because of the collaboration of 14 people with him, they had to deal with him somehow.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  So they pulled him in and said, we'll talk to you, but behind closed doors.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  So Rodriguez was kind of intimidated to keep quiet.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  Well, anyway, at the time, NBC News got wind of this, and also CNN, which I just found out.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  And they sent a news crew, and I've got email verifications of this,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  a news crew out to his house for a complete day, right after these 9-11 hearings.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  Now, Rodriguez is kind of quiet, says a few things to a paper, but doesn't get into his story,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  because I think what happened, and you can verify this with him, they were telling him to keep quiet,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  we need to talk and discuss this, but basically 9-11 Commission never uses his words to justify it.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  Well, it's classic. They go, this is national security, we're going to use this,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  but keep quiet for a few months while we track it down.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  Well, anyway, the real key to this thing comes, NBC News gets wind of it,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  and they send a crew out all day, and they sit with Rodriguez Williams the whole day.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000]  They tape him for a complete day, everything he said to me, everything he's said to other people,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  like overseas and Puerto Rico and Telemundo and all these overseas news broadcasts
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  that are covering his story and let him talk uncensored.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  Well, anyway, they get all this tape and all his words, but they take it back and not a word of it ever appears.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  Same thing supposedly happens with CNN, and I got a couple emails from the CNN crew that supposedly were supposed to come out and see him.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  However, what happens is that they come out and they get all the information but never run it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  And I say to them, and I bluntly as a journalist and as a person who basically looks at things from a journalistic point of view,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  if I was an editor or whatever, I'm not going out on a journalistic limb.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]  Perhaps if Rodriguez is the only one that hears that, I want some verification.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  Well, he's got corroboration of 14 people, names.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  Exactly. We're going to be talking with him, and I want to hold you over when Mr. Rodriguez is on with us.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  But I also want to add this right now.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  It wasn't a journalistic limb, Alex, is what I'm saying.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]  No, I understand it wasn't. We have all these other witnesses, but let me just add this.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  Before we go to break, this is very important.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  Don't forget about the three data recorders and the firemen and the rescue workers finding it.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  And that was in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  But again, it's still a news blackout other than the Philadelphia Daily News, this show, and your columns.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  A New World Order can emerge.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  Look, I know we got loaded phone lines.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  I haven't given the phone number up yet today because we're not taking calls yet.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]  We will do that sometime in the next hour.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  We've got to cover this information.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  It's so important.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:10.000]  We're talking to, of course, a writer for American Free Press and a lot of other publications, Greg Zemanski, about all the major news that's coming out about 9-11.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  More and more whistleblowers going public.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  More and more insiders going public.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  More and more people who witness what happened on 9-11 going public.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  Rescue workers.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  Greg, have you seen the David Shaler MI5 article we just put out today?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  You know something?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]  I glanced at it and I did not get a good read yet.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]  I mean, here's a guy who was with MI5 talking about the British being involved in terrorism over there.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  He's looking as a counterterrorism specialist who worked on terrorism in that area of the MI5.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  At 9-11, he's saying it's obviously an inside job as well.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  It's an explosive story, Alex, and I'll make sure I get and read it.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  It sounds very interesting.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  Well, I hope you do some work with it.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  Yeah, I'm going to take a look at it.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  I know I thought and I didn't have time this morning to get at it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  Well, getting back to Mr. Rodriguez, he's got 14 witnesses and you've got the explosion and the fire shooting up.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  Well, if I could just say something kind of in general on a story like this and why I believe it's important.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]  As you know, if you just isolate the incident of how, let's say, the North Tower went down,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000]  you're hearing all these stories about the scientific explanations from the government's point of view,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]  the scientific explanations from the conspiracy theorist's point of view.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000]  If you imagine yourself in a court of law right now listening to that, you take the next step and you bring up a witness.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  You bring up a witness like Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000]  Now, as you know, eyewitness testimony can be very reliable, it can be very unreliable.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  And that's basically since if you line up 10 people and you look at a murder, you're going to get maybe 10 different accounts.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  People see different things.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  However, when eyewitness testimony is the most valuable and more credible than scientific explanations,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  is when it can be corroborated and corroborated with documentation.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]  And that's exactly what Rodriguez's story is.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  So basically if you're a jury listening to, well, did it fall down by explosives or did it fall down by the airplanes up there?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  Rodriguez's testimony corroborated by 14 other people is going to sway the jury to the side of the demolition, of course,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  because basically you look at what he saw, how 14 people see a burning man coming within seconds from below.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]  How could it be?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  Understand, they're in the basement complex, what, four floors beneath the ground?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]  So I would guess they were in the first.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  I think he said sub-level one, so that would be the first basement level.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]  So there's several other basement levels.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]  And then somebody, did this fellow come running from their level or from another level?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  His level.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  He was only 300 feet away from the office.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  And he reported that fire shot up out of it.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]  Yeah, fire shot through the elevator shaft.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]  It could not have shot down that quickly.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]  Well, they admit that fire didn't shoot down even to like the 50th floor.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]  Yeah, I mean, there were people using those elevators up until, I mean, they couldn't have shot down that quickly.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  Yeah, they were using the elevators.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]  So, wow.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  Within the time span.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]  And which particular tower was he in?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]  North.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]  Yeah.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]  Unbelievable.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]  And now we have CNN and NBC going and interviewing him but not reporting on him.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  Yeah, I mean, come on.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000]  I mean, look, the journalist that, you know, I want to know, I'd like to hear their conversation when they decided not to run this
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  or decided not to use the resources to find these other people and verify that.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]  I mean, here's a guy burnt to a crisp in a hospital and, you know, they're ignoring it.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]  And now, years later, basically it's kind of they're hoping that, you know, it's just forgotten about.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000]  And, you know, hopefully people will look at this and say, you know, if they're lying about this.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:06.000]  And basically, I'm not saying, you know, even to a point where if they would have just investigated this in a forthright manner.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]  However, do you think that investigation might have been contrary to the government's story?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  Maybe that's why they didn't do it.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]  Alright, we're getting Mr. Rodriguez on the line right now.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000]  cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:25.000]  Get the advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:15.000]  Last thing out, Southern California to upstate New York from Austin, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000]  From Pensacola, Florida to Chicago, Illinois, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]  We're going to be here for another two hours. We're into hour number two.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:33.000]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we have the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]  who doubts the official 9-11 story going public.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]  We, of course, have broken the news that former MI5 agent says 9-11 an inside job.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]  Attack was coup d'etat. Buildings were demolished by controlled demolitions.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  David Shaler, who worked terrorism, and award-winning researcher and author Greg Zemanski is also riding shotgun with us.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000]  Breaking and magnifying so many of these articles, including 9-11 rescue workers finding three of the four data recorders
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000]  and being told to shut up. And that's even made it subsequently into things like the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]  So this is confirmed. There are lawsuits involving all of this.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:22.000]  I am extremely honored to have on the line one of the survivors who was in the North Tower, William Rodriguez.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000]  We talked about his story in the last 30 minutes, how they witnessed explosions down in their basement level,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]  and it burning and hurting people, and the fire coming up, not down.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  And he helped a lot of folks, of course, get out of there, barely survived himself.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000]  And we're honored to have William Rodriguez on with us. William, welcome.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]  My pleasure. Thank you for inviting me. It's an honor for me to be here.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]  Well, it's great to be here. And we've got Greg riding shotgun with us, so we'll be popping in and out with him.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]  We're about to break here in a moment, but I want to first just talk about who you are, why you were working there,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]  and then when we get back, I want to tell the story. I want to go back to those first minutes and give you the floor
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]  and just let you tell us exactly, in your words, what happened.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  But first off, tell us about yourself, Mr. Rodriguez, and why you're going public.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]  Yes, my name is William Rodriguez. I worked in the building for almost 20 years.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:25.000]  On September 11, I would have been 20 years, and actually I was there as the person in charge of all the stairwells of the North Tower.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]  I was the porter that had to do the maintenance of the whole building, of all the stairwells.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]  The building has three staircases, A, B, and C, and I was the person in charge of it.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  And you'd been there 20 years as of September 11, 2001.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.000]  That is correct. And like I said, I have a personal view of exactly what happened on September 11.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000]  Not only was I there, but I'm actually the last survivor from the North Tower that was pulled from the rubble
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]  and actually survived under the rubble.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000]  Now, I remember that. When did you start understanding the official story was a fraud? Day one?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000]  Well, I didn't know on day one. I'll be honest with you because, Alex, at the beginning I came out on the news probably days or weeks
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:20.000]  because I came out with the story and I testified for the media, for national media, on that same day of what I experienced.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:31.000]  And then I started to realize that my story was continuously being edited, that the whole information that I was given wasn't coming out correctly.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  That's absolutely key.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]  Yeah, that was actually tidbits here and there.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  So regardless of who you talked to, they were editing key parts of it?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]  That is correct. That is correct. And it was a continuous effort from all the medias.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000]  I actually interviewed hundreds and hundreds of hours from September 11 until today.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:00.000]  I mean, I have a whole library of interviews and it's incredible because I have some raw copies of some of the interviews that I actually performed.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]  And it's unbelievable.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  The electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]  and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the earth into a prison planet.

[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.? Read the labels.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000]  We're talking to an individual who's quite famous. He was the last person living to be pulled from the wreckage.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]  WTC basement blast, an injured burn victim blows official 9-11 story sky high.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]  He's William Rodriguez.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000]  And the key here is, as I remember getting inklings of his story and many others who saw the same thing on 9-11,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]  but every time he talked to a major TV network or station, they would put him on the news
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000]  but edit out how he talked about the explosions down in the base of the building,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]  which firefighters and others said they also heard, witnessed and saw.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]  Even reporters were saying it as it happened on a few of the news channels.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]  So they didn't want that out there.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]  And remember, they ordered the FAA tape shredded.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]  They ordered the people on the ground that found three of the flight data recorders,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]  you know, highly decorated rescue workers, keep your mouth shut.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]  You know, when they found these recorders, clearly marked just the continual hauling away the rubble,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]  international security to China, despite the fact the family tried to stop it.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]  He was the head of maintenance for the three major stairwells for the entire building.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:23.000]  Been there 20 years, a senior member of maintenance and, you know, keeping all of that in place.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]  And so joining us again is William Rodriguez.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]  And just recapping what he said in the last segment for stations that don't care of that first segment.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]  William, now let's just go through the story, that morning, what you were doing, what happened.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]  Please describe it for us.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]  I usually get to work at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]  That day, as a miracle, I went in late at 8.30.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  I called the office and I said I was going to be a little late.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000]  And they said, well, you have to get here because we don't have anybody to take your position doing the stairwells.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]  So I got there at 8.30.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]  I say it's a miracle because I would have been at the top of the building when the plane hit.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]  The reason is because I started cleaning the stairwells from the top down.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]  And actually I will have breakfast every morning at Windows of the World,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]  employees at the top of the building.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]  So at that moment, 8.30, I was actually at the basement talking to one of the supervisors.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]  And around 8.45, we hear an explosion, a huge explosion.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]  And it came out from under our feet.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]  And I'm telling you this because of experience.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]  I've been there for 20 years, so I do understand where the noise was coming from.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000]  And at that moment, it was an electrical generator that just blew up under sublevels.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]  And when I say sublevels, because I was located on B1, that's basement number one,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]  and the building has six sublevels all the way down to B6.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  And I felt this huge explosion.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]  And at that moment, I was going to verbalize it.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]  I was going to say it's one of the electrical generators that just blew up.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]  And when I was going to verbalize it is when I heard the impact at the top of the building.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]  And it sounded pretty far away.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]  And it was so hard that the walls shake and broke.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]  They cracked all over.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]  And the false ceiling just collapsed, and the sprinkler system got activated.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]  And everybody started screaming.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]  There was like 14 people inside the office.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]  And at that moment, we don't know what's happening.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]  We thought, again, it's an explosion at the sublevel.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]  And when I was going to pick up the phone to call the emergency,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]  there's a guy coming running into the office saying, explosion, explosion, explosion.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]  And this guy was a black guy.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]  He has his hands extended.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]  And all the skin from under his armpit was pulled on both arms all the way to the fingertips.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]  And he was hanging like a piece of cloth.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]  And actually, I thought he was clothing while he was hanging.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]  And then I realized it was his skin.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000]  He was standing in front of the freight elevator at the basement when he was actually burned.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]  Now, this is the basement.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]  This is not at the top of the building.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]  And I said, what happened?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]  And he said, the elevators, the elevators.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]  And I went to pick up the phone to call the EMS that was located on Building 2.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]  Building 1 and Building 2 connected through the basement.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]  And when I said Building 2, it's the south tower.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]  And so I went to pick up the phone.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]  And at that moment, we heard another explosion.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]  And the floor shakes so much, it was like an earthquake.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]  And at that moment, I was thinking that it was probably an earthquake.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]  And it was telling everybody to get under the door frames because the floor was moving.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]  And then I realized, well, what am I talking about?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]  This is an explosion what I'm hearing.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]  Everybody out, everybody out.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]  I start pushing everybody out of the office.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]  I take the guy, the black guy that was burned,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]  the name of the guy is Felipe David.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]  He's a guy from Honduras, which I did not know.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]  He worked for Aramac, the company that does supplies for all the vending machines.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000]  And I put his arm around my shoulder, and I started helping him out of the building.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]  Now, the way to get out was through the loading dock.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]  And it was pretty far.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]  I mean, we're talking about, well, like 600 or 800 feet away.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]  And once I get out with all these people, I see an ambulance.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]  I stop the ambulance.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]  I put Mr. Felipe David inside the ambulance.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]  And that's when I hear a plane hit the building, a plane hit the building.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]  I turned around.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]  I look up.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]  I see the hole.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]  I see the fire.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]  I see the debris falling apart.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]  And all of a sudden, I go into a frenzy because I started thinking about the people from Windows of the World.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]  I said, we've got to go back.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]  We've got to go back.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]  We've got to go back.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]  And the same people that I just pulled from the basement, they started screaming at me,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]  Rodriguez, you're not going back in there.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]  You stay here.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]  Even my supervisor that I just pulled out.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]  But I said, no, no, we've got to go back.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]  And I took the radio from the security guard, and I started running inside the building again.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000]  When I get inside, there was water all over because the sprinkler system got activated.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]  And I get to the top of the loading dock.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.000]  And just by the sense of surviving the 1993 bombing, I was actually on the 1993 bombing,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]  I was stuck in an elevator for several hours.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]  We were talking about like four hours.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000]  I started looking inside the trucks, the delivery trucks that were on the loading dock to make sure that there was no explosives or anything like that.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]  And I continued going to buildings to the south power to hit on the window of something called the OCC of the operation.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]  Let me just stop you for a second, Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000]  Before you go to the operational center, being there in the first bombing, knowing what it feels like,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]  and then experiencing the individual running in and saying the fire came up,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]  I want to get into some detail about what Mr. David said to you on that.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]  And then I also, though, want to ask you the question.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]  Were you looking for truck bombs because you were putting two and two together in the back of your brain from hearing and feeling that explosion?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]  And because of the experience of 1993.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:09.000]  Now, remember, being there, the actual expectation of something happening in the building was a constant.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:18.000]  The employees, we always talk about it on a weekly basis because we said this is a job that was never finished.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]  They're going to try it again.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]  So we continued having these kind of conversations on a weekly basis.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000]  We were aware by osmosis of everything that was happening around.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000]  And I will bring you to that point, that experience later on, because when I testified to the 9-11 Commission,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000]  I did give them some details that miraculously didn't show up on the final report.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.000]  Now, let's talk about that, but I interrupted you at the point you got to the Emergency Operations Center.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]  Yeah, the Operation Control Center was actually a center that was created after 1993 bombing.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.000]  The World Trade Center, they spent $136 million to upgrade the whole security in the building.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]  A quarter of a billion, actually, but 136 was just for security.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.000]  They created this center, and stupidly enough, they put it inside the building, which made sense to have it outside the building.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:22.000]  And there, they control everything from access to special doors to the security cameras, practically everything.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.000]  When I get there, as I run towards that office, I find one guy, the name is Jimmy Barrett.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]  He worked for American Building Maintenance.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]  And I said, Jimmy, you've got to get out of here.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]  He didn't even know that the building got hit.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000]  He was on the sub-levels of the South Tower, and that gives you a general idea how many people probably died
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]  on the South Tower without ever knowing what was happening.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]  And he said, you've got to get out, you've got to get out.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]  A plane hit the building. He couldn't believe it.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]  And there was a lady from the Marriott Hotel Security, the one that checks every employee.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]  She's there, trembling, because she was a new employee.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]  She didn't know what was happening.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]  I said, you've got to get out of here.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]  And she was afraid of leaving her post because she didn't want to get fired.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]  He said, no, you've got to get out.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000]  What about the reports that up high in the towers there was some type of speaker system telling people to stay at their post?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]  That was Lloyd Thompson.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]  It was a guy that disappeared for three years.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.000]  And he testified on the last week of the hearings for the 9-11 Commission.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]  And they said that they couldn't find him.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000]  And it's the funniest thing because I have Lloyd on my organization from day one.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]  And I could have supplied him very easily.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]  It's something that is mind-boggling.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]  Well, then tell us, who was on the speaker saying stay at your post?
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]  Actually, it wasn't that staying at the post.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:55.000]  It was actually saying that people were coming down on the Plaza level, on the Mediterranean level.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000]  And that was actually the area that was hit by the first plane.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]  And all the debris was falling down that part.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]  So actually, it was a call for people to go back, not to get out on the Plaza level,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]  because they were going to get hit by the debris.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]  So it was an actual misunderstanding that happened on that moment.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]  Plus the amount of automatic recordings that they have in the building.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]  Now, not every floor worked.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]  Not every floor had the speaker system activated.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]  Well, that's a major mystery then, at least partially solved.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]  Amazing.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]  Let's bring in Greg Zemenski.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]  Greg, there are so many points here.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]  Should we get more into his eyewitness account?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:45.000]  Or should we get into how the media tried to cover up and edit every time they interviewed Mr. Rodriguez,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]  one of the heroes of 9-11?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000]  Well, I think you ought to stick with his eyewitness account and those 14 people and maybe what happened to them.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000]  And then it very well flows into the fact that the media had all this stuff.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]  And why didn't they at least tell their story?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]  They're not going out on a journalistic limb here.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]  Exactly.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]  I mean, I've talked to a lot of firefighters, other people who were told to shut up.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]  Were you told ever directly, or do you know people who were told to shut up?
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]  Well, indirectly.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]  They told me not to touch several subjects.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]  They would say, just stick to what we're talking about.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]  Don't talk about other things.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]  And it didn't make any sense.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]  I always maintain my story from the day that I was pulled from the rubble.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]  Listen, I showed up on CNN on that day, okay?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000]  And if you can get the transcript, because I have been unsuccessful, but luckily I have a copy.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]  And my story now is exactly the same one that I gave on that day.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]  Oh, I've got to have that tape.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]  I've got to get that tape.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]  Stay there, Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]  We'll be right back with yourself and, of course, Greg.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]  I'm Alex Jones, prisonplanet.com and fullwars.com.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]  Hi, folks.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]  a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]  Remember, gold is liquid, private and portable.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]  atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]  Black murky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]  cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]  even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury and aluminum are no problem.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]  without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]  Black murky elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]  which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]  Upgrade to black murky purification elements.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]  and believes strongly that the American people need alternative sources of information
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]  in order to understand the society they live in today.

[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]  Sandal season is finally here,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000]  but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]  If your nails look dark or discolored,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]  now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000]  All-natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]  the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]  I used to have yellow nails and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]  Walgreens, Longs, Brooks and independent pharmacies nationwide
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]  or online at Drugstore.com.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]  All right, approaching the halfway point in this broadcast.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]  We're going to keep Mr. Rodriguez on with us.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]  He's honored us by doing that.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]  One of the heroes of 9-11, helped save a lot of people and barely made it out himself.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]  Last person to be pulled from the rubble.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]  We're going to keep him on with us with Paul Craig Roberts,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000]  the former Assistant Secretary of Treasury under Ronald Reagan and his administration.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000]  And if Mr. Zemanski, Greg Zemanski, wants to stay with us, he's welcome to ride shotgun.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]  We'll kind of have our own little roundtable discussion here.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000]  I was just talking to you, Mr. Rodriguez, William Rodriguez, during the break,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000]  and you talked about how you were telling me how you've just been on this European tour,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]  I guess with Jimmy Walters, exposing all of this.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]  And almost, you didn't say almost, you said everyone knew the truth.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]  Everyone you talked to in Europe never believed the story.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]  Tell us about that. That's exciting.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]  Jimmy Walters put this nice mega tour through the whole Europe.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:21.000]  We went to Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, Madrid, every single country that we went to.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000]  Not once we have a dissenting voice that the official story was a lie.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]  They even have questions.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]  Listen, we have unfiltered news here compared to the news that you were getting over there.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000]  We continue having interviews from the European media that was never shown on the American media.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]  Why did that happen?
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000]  I said, well, you know, at that moment we explained that it was a whole cover-up.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000]  Well, yeah, that shows control that day one they would put you on CNN as a hero and as a survivor,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000]  went back into the building, had it collapse on you, the last to be dug out alive.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]  I mean, think of what a big story that is.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]  And they would edit out craftily any discussion of explosions.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]  Greg, that really shows the premeditated nature, doesn't it, Greg?
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]  Well, yeah, it does. It shows the state of the media right now.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000]  You know, like it said, this is all our story, and William's story should be told,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]  and the media has an obligation and a major story like that to get it right.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000]  And you can see from what William's saying, they basically had another agenda,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000]  and it's that agenda along with the government agenda that needs to be exposed,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]  and that's basically what we're doing right now.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000]  Well, I want to go back specifically, I mean, understand we have an eyewitness here.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]  We have these other 14 eyewitnesses.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000]  We have the individual, Mr. David, burned, sang, fire, shot up.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]  Clearly, firefighters reported bombs going off.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]  We have Silverstein saying they pulled Building 7.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000]  What were the other 14 people told to do, or where are they today, Mr. Rodriguez?
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]  Some of the people, we are unable to reach them.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000]  We have tried with Greg Simansky to contact them, and we're having a difficult time.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]  Some of the people, I'm still in contact with them.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]  They validate and verify my story.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000]  But the funny thing is, Alex, that at the beginning, once my story came out,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]  some people even chuckled.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]  They said, oh, this is Superman.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]  It's a funny story, because the guy did incredible things on that day.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000]  But once the weeks passed, and people started talking about it on the media,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.000]  and asking for reunions and meetings for major networks to actually put together with survivors
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]  that I saved on that day, they started to think about it,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000]  and shutting off of their previous comments.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]  The funny thing is also that I even sent Mr. Greg Simansky a couple of the emails
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]  of major networks that I received during that time,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000]  and during the 9-11 Commission testimony for a request of interviews, and it never came out.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]  I did the interviews, and it never came out.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]  Greg, have we gotten statements?
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]  I know you've been talking to them from CNN and others.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000]  Why didn't you hear this?
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000]  I'm in the process of giving CNN a call, but it's like getting through at the Pentagon nowadays.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000]  It used to be that you'd call a journalist and they'd talk to you over the phone,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000]  but now it's very difficult.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]  But I'm going to get to the bottom of why CNN didn't run the story.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]  Did you see when Gore Vidal was on CNN about three years ago, and he goes,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]  I just want to stop the press before I go live.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000]  This is on TV.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000]  He goes, before I say anything, this is the first time there hadn't been a lieutenant general in a suit
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]  behind the cameras telling me what I can and can't say.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:53.000]  Yeah, I mean, Mr. Rodriguez's story is vitally important for every American to hear, unedited.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]  That's the reason why I wanted to tell it.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]  It isn't my story.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]  It isn't any other journalist's story.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]  And sometimes journalists get up on this track that they own some story because they broke it first.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]  No, it's not that.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000]  It's Mr. Rodriguez's story, and it's a story that the American people own.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000]  And on a day that occurred like that, to have it unedited, my goodness, what is going on?
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]  And we need to get answers from NBC, not from the journalists,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000]  and I assume there's probably journalists who probably wanted to run it, but from the people who stopped it.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000]  Well, I'll tell you, Greg, I've talked to a lot of major national reporters,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]  and they've told me point blank, we're told not to talk about this.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000]  We just lost Greg, and our other guest is on an Internet phone.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]  That's why it sounds a little bit broken, but this is powerful info.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:48.000]  We're going to stay with Mr. Rodriguez, and we've got Mr. Roberts coming on as well.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000]  For a while now, you've been hearing about energized water
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]  and what it can do for your health.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]  But have you taken the next step and actually experienced energized water?
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000]  It's absolutely incredible what you'll experience while using the energized products from Aqua Northwest.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]  You've seen the banner on GCNLive.com, but have you experienced the power of the pyramid?
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]  We all know that negative energy can make you sick at home or in the office,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000]  but the energy pyramid from Aqua Northwest wipes out that negative energy within a 125-foot diameter.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000]  After one hour, negative energy fields should be raised to a positive level,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000]  resulting in you and others in the area to feel wonderfully energized, among other possible health benefits.

[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]  and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites,
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000]  but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]  atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]  foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black murky purification elements
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:51.000]  for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:23.000]  Right now, on PrisonPlanet.com, former MI5 agent says 911 an inside job.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]  Attack was coup d'etat.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]  Buildings were demolished by controlled demolitions.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000]  David Shaler worked in anti-terrorism, now going public.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:39.000]  And at the same time, we have the chief economist at one of the major federal departments,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000]  Mr. Reynolds, going public a few weeks ago about how the official story is a complete fraud.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:51.000]  We have Andres Fambulo, who was the defense secretary, technology minister, going public.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]  We have Michael Meacher, number three in the Blair government, resigning two years ago
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]  and saying they weren't involved in the attack.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]  They certainly knew all about it and funded it.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]  There's so many people.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]  And online with us at the same time, I meant to only have them for 30 minutes,
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]  but it's such an important testimony.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000]  William Rodriguez, who was again cited for pulling out so many people trying to save them,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000]  going back in, having a building collapse on him and others.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]  One of the last people to be saved, William Rodriguez, talking about those bombs,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]  those explosions going off.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000]  We'll be popping back and forth with Mr. Rodriguez's story.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]  But Paul Craig Roberts, the bio is too long to read it all,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000]  but he was a distinguished fellow at the Cato Institute from 1993 to 1996.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.000]  From 1982 through 1993, he held the William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]  at the Center for Strategic and International Studies from 1981 to 1982.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]  He served as Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Economic Policy for President Reagan
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]  and the Treasury Secretary.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000]  Reagan credited him with a major role in the economic recovery tax act of 1981,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]  and he was awarded the Treasury Department's Meritorious Service Award
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.000]  for outstanding contributions to his formulation of the United States economic policy.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000]  And again, Dr. Roberts' bio is a couple more pages long.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000]  I read about 10% of it.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000]  But he's very distinguished, very conservative.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000]  I was reading some of his quotes the other day on air, and he said,
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]  look, I never change, they change, just like Ron Paul has talked about.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]  I mean, if you think a giant government is conservative,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]  if you think a $2.6 trillion budget is conservative,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]  if you think all this gun control and open borders is conservative,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]  then call me a liberal.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000]  That's what I'm saying. Alex Jones is saying that.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000]  I would imagine Dr. Roberts would agree with us.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thanks for coming on, sir.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]  Thank you.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.000]  I saw this headline with Greg Zemenski talking about how you're now questioning the official story,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000]  not all the minutiae and the specifics, just how the whole thing stinks
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]  and all the lies we've been told.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000]  Can you tell us, sir, when you started questioning things?
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000]  Oh, well, I've been questioning things all my life, Alex.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000]  It's just the things that get questioned change with the event.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000]  Can you speak up, sir? I apologize.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000]  I was questioning this invasion of Iraq before it happened.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.000]  On 9-11, it's when I read Morgan Reynolds' account,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000]  which seemed to be very carefully researched,
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000]  and I've known Morgan Reynolds for years.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000]  He's a distinguished professor,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000]  and he was chief economist in the Bush Administration for the Department of Commerce.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000]  He's also a member of the Mont Pelerin Society,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.000]  which is a group of libertarian conservative scholars.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000]  By the way, sir, he's now being called an evil liberal,
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000]  and you've been called that when you guys have some of the most conservative records known.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000]  Yes, there are certainly a lot of brown shirts out there
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000]  who are true believers of whatever the government tells them.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:14.000]  And anyhow, what made me wonder when I read Morgan Reynolds' account,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:21.000]  because over the years, because I criticize or I tell the truth about the war,
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]  I get a lot of emails from people who say,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000]  well, what about 9-11, what about 9-11?
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000]  I have not paid much attention to them because I don't know too much about that,
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:38.000]  but I have received a number of emails from people who claim they're engineers,
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:47.000]  and they say that the building could not have fallen the way it did
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000]  according to the government account of what destroyed it.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000]  Well, I personally have probably had 25 engineers on.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000]  And what did they say?
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Well, I had a good family friend who's a structural engineer
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  who worked in the World Financial Center and saw the first plane, saw the second plane,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  saw it all happen, and he was on that morning,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  and he said it was a perfect controlled top-down demolition in the big towers
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  and a perfect demolition on Building 7 bottom-down with the classic crimp.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  Even most controlled demolitions are not that precise as Building 7.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  That was a masterwork, a master craftsmanship.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  It would have taken several months to wire it that well.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Well, that's another very curious thing because no plane hit the 47-story building,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  and yet it collapsed as the others.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  And so the explanation of why it collapsed I've never understood at all.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  I remember engineers were explaining to me that if the towers collapsed because of fire weakening the steel,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  that they would have fallen off at an angle and wrecked blocks of New York.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  They wouldn't have come down on themselves unless the fire was of equal intensity
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  at every corner on every floor.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  And of course it wasn't.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  Well, it was a cool black fire.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Yeah, it was suffocating as far as the pictures show.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  People were standing in the gaping holes, and the firefighters said that in one of the towers
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  it was two small fires left.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  And Alex, if I can interject.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  Yes, this is Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  Yeah, we have a presentation of the final draft of the NIST,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  the National Institute of Safety and Technology here in New York two days ago.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  And at the end of their presentation we asked very hard questions because they said
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  they didn't find any evidence of explosives inside the building.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Yeah, that made the press when you guys stood up.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Tell us about it.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  Yeah, the funny thing is that I recorded with my own camera,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  so we're going to make that available for you, Alex, so you can post it here
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  so you can see exactly what happened there.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Because again, it was actually presented on the press,
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  but was never explained what happened with the people asking the questions.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  Now, the problem was that they couldn't answer when we asked about,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  well, why the building fell in such an implosion way.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  And they said, well, there was no sustaining power by the other floors,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  but it was a free fall.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  And if that is true, why Building 7 collapsed the same way?
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And it was never hit by a plane like it was yesterday.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Mr. Rodriguez, let me bring this up to Dr. Roberts, because Dr. Roberts,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  what are they going to do as the certain elements of the military industrial complex
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  that have the motive and all of this, what are they going to do in your educated expert opinion
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  as more and more prominent people, and now it's beginning to snowball,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  begin to go public and just simply say the emperor is wearing no clothes?
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  What do you forecast happening?
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  I'm not sure anything will happen.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  If you think about it, we still don't know about the assassination of President John Kennedy.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  I mean, it's fairly clear that it wasn't a single lone nut gunman.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  But we don't know.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  We can't find out.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  It's been 40-something years, I think.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  We don't know about the assassination of Robert Kennedy, JFK's brother.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  They lied to us about Ruby Red.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  They lied about Waco.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  They lied about Saddam Hussein and the reason for going to war in Iraq.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  So I think we can just take granted that the government lies about whatever.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  Yeah, they lie more often than telling the truth.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  Well, there's no reason to believe what the government says.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  There's no record of integrity on controversial issues with the government.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  And we do know that large numbers, I didn't used to think it was possible for them to hide something
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  like the assassination of the president, what really happened,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  because I didn't think you could get that many people to participate.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  But apparently it is possible to get people to be quiet and hush and go along.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  So I would imagine if Bush can survive the Downing Street memos
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  and survive taking us into an illegal war that had no justification,
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  that we were told was a cakewalk war that would be over in three weeks,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  and now Rumsfeld announced this morning that it will be 12 years.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  If they can survive that, they can survive whatever happened to the World Trade Center.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Now, I have to say up front, I am not an expert and don't know what happened,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  but I do notice that there are people who challenge the explanation,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  and there is this great effort to shut them up.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  It seems to me if the government was confident of its story, it wouldn't take that tact.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  It would confront what is being said and answer it.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  We don't see that. They are not answering the people like the janitor who says he heard explosions in the basement.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  There is no real reason to think so many people were making things up.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  Well, Dr. Roberts, you just stole my thunder. Exactly.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  We've got Mr. Rodriguez, who is an admitted hero who went back and tried to save people and got buried.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  He was the last person to be saved.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  He was interviewed all over live TV and then would notice that they would edit out his comments about explosions.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  Every local channel, every national channel, over and over again, he kept wondering why they edited that out.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  That shows massive control and massive cover-up right there, Dr. Roberts' comments.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  Well, it seems to me, it's amazing to me that it's that easy for them to do.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  But what disturbs me is that there are people who challenge it, and yet it doesn't get answered in an honest way.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  So it seems to me what the government should do is take all of these people who have a case against the original complaint
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  and address what they say and give some answer.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  But, sir, on the face of it, the 9-11 Commission says there were no steel columns in the center of the buildings
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  when they had some of the biggest steel columns, 44 of them, in the world.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  They don't even mention Building 7 in their 300-and-something page report or any of its indexes.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  We don't know where they got their information, do we?
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  These commissions often, they get information that's fed to them.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  So the real question is, who's feeding them the information?
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  Well, we've got Rice's deputy feeding them.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  Well, then that might tell you something.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  Well, sir, I mean, let's just get right down to brass tacks here.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  Obviously, you smell a gigantic stinking rat.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Something, you know, is dead in the attic.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  We've got to go clean it out of there.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  We know some big fat possum or raccoon is up there.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  Do we have the will to open, which I've done, and open the trap door and go up in there
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  and clean this maggot-infested thing out?
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  Are we going to keep just smelling the stench until we all get diseases from it?
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  I mean, bottom line, in your gut, I mean, look at who has the motive.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  I mean, can you speak to motive for having these events?
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  Why would the Arabs do something like this when it would bring down the biggest military on the planet on them?
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  That's a very interesting question.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  There is an answer to that, and that would be if they were clever enough to suck us into a Middle Eastern quagmire.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  We do appear to be in a quagmire, both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, where the activity is, again, heating up,
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  and we are now leaning on the British to put more troops in Afghanistan.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  But Bush said they wanted to have permanent bases there and wanted to have somewhat of a quagmire.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  I guess it's not this bad of a quagmire.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  You know, if we can't occupy Baghdad or control the road to the airport,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  I don't know how we're going to have a permanent base.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  But I agree with you that there's too many reasons to disbelieve the government.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  There are too many problems with what they tell us.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  Well, Dr. Roberts, it's like this.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  If I had a neighbor for ten years who all he ever did was lie and cheat me,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  and then he said, hey, let me house it for you, why would I trust him?
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  All the government does is lie and cheat us.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  Well, that's what I said.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  We still don't know about John F. Kennedy.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  We do know they lied about Ruby Ridge, Waco.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  We know they lied about Iraq.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  The Downing Street memos prove it beyond inquest.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  Mr. Rodriguez, let's bring Mr. Rodriguez in here for a second with Dr. Roberts.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  Dr. Roberts, of course, was in the Reagan Administration at a very high level
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  as there in the Treasury Department.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  But going back to Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Rodriguez,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  do you have any comments or questions for Mr. Roberts, Dr. Roberts?
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  Well, I have a comment.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Actually, my group and the Skycraper Safety Campaign were the only two groups
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  that went to Washington to Congress to ask for a commission to be created.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  We got the commission created, but it was after a big headache.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  You may remember that the President said, we don't need a commission.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  We already know who did it.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  And we said, no, the families and the victims have the right to know exactly what happened
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  and what took us to that position.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  And after a lot of press, bad press, and a lot of manipulation,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  we have to put actually widows and mothers on TV to actually press for the White House
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  to change the position, we have the 9-11 Commission.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  After we have the 9-11 Commission, we ask them to have subpoena power,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  which they never used.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  They didn't want subpoena power.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Well, let me ask Dr. Roberts this, you spurred a thought.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Dr. Roberts, who could do a real investigation?
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  We know Congress is so political and so partisan, it's not going to happen there.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  Would it be maybe a group of states getting together and having a commission
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  or putting together our own, maybe nationally televised private commission with experts?
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  I mean, how would you do that?
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  I don't know.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  I think, you know, what you're trying to do, what Mr. Rodriguez is trying to do,
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  what other people whose integrity forces them to ask questions,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  which probably don't do them any good, they will continue,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  just like people have continued to challenge the official story of Kennedy's assassination.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  I don't know whether it will have any effect, if ever getting the story correct or not.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  It may have an effect over time of making succeeding generations less trusting
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  on what the government tells them.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  But, Doctor, what about Dick Cheney in the September 2000 PNAC document
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  saying we need a Pearl Harbor,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  Brzezinski saying a helpful Pearl Harbor for imperial mobilization to mobilize the slaves,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  that's us, to go attack the barbarians.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  I mean, these are the type of terms they use over and over again in government and think tank white papers.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  They talk about Operation Northwoods, the catalyzing terrorist attack.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Operation Northwoods talks about the government carrying out its own attack.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  Operation Gladio was carried out.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  Gulf of Tonkin now admitted, never happened.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  We have the LBJ tapes released a year ago.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  Comments on that?
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  Well, it's been a notorious characteristic of governments for a long time.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  You know, in the czarist government in pre-Bolshevik Russia,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  the secret police used to carry out terrorist acts so they could go arrest people that they wanted to arrest.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  They blamed them.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  So those things do happen and have happened.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  And the question is about the World Trade Center.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  And I don't know the answer, but I agree that what we've been told seems to have problems
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  and that the government is not very attentive to answering those problems.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  It has no indication of wanting to face these challenges and reply to them.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Doctors, stay there.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  They're going to just ride over.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  They're just going to ride over it the way they do in the war.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  Stay there. We've got to break.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  He's sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security,
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  the nightmare U.N. population control programs, the cashless society control grid,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  satellite tracking and buyable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the info war.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  That's 888-2533139.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Again, that number, 888-2533139.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere,
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  Shocking? Of course.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott PhD

[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  about improving your nutrition without all the potions and lotions
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  that are sold to mask over all the problems most folks are taught
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  with resulting from the horrible things that are taught as being so good for us.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Also, you will learn about the three foods to avoid at all costs

[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  another 30 minutes to take your calls in the next hour
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  and get into some other key points on 9-11
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  because it's the foundational event of this entire police state.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  Learn the truth about 9-11.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  Get my new film Marshall Law 911, Rise of the Police State.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  We detailed how they do it, how they covered it up, who stands to gain.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  It's my best film, my third 9-11 film.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  Please get it today, 1-888-253-3139
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  or order a copy at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  Dr. Roberts, of course, writes for counterpunch.com
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  antiwar.com, newsmax.com of all places
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  and you can just type Paul Craig Roberts in
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  and you'll see literally hundreds of different websites.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  Prisonplanet.com and Infowars routinely link to those stories as well.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  We find his analysis to be excellent.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  But the reason we had Mr. Roberts on is he's just saying,
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  hey, this official story's got holes in it and things stink to high heaven
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  and that's why it's important.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  More and more prominent people are stepping forward
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  and regardless of what happened on 9-11, I know what happened.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  You're now investigating it.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  But regardless, Dr. Roberts,
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  they certainly are using it to destroy America
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  while leaving the borders wide open, aren't they?
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  That's for sure.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  We are losing our civil liberties very rapidly
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  and the borders are wide open.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  And you know something else that I just remembered.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  You remember the Timothy McVeigh thing, the Murrah building,
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  the Oklahoma City bombing?
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  There were a variety of experts,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  including an Air Force general who was some sort of munitions expert.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  He became part and former head of Air Force weapons development.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  Yeah, he only lived a couple blocks from me in Alexandria, Virginia,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  inside the Beltway in Washington.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  And he said that that building blew up from the inside out.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  And I remember seeing a lot of accounts of that.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  I made a film about it.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  We had the police, the BATF ran up in their bomb gear seconds after the blast.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  They get, oh, yeah, we were told not to come in.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  It's all on record, sir.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  They have all the surveillance cameras, but they declared national security.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  Yes, I saw that the government withholds so much information that it...
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  I mean, if they've got McVeigh doing it, why not show the video, Doctor?
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  That's exactly right.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  If it supports their case, why don't they show it?
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  So I think that's a very good indication that they're hiding something.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  What it is, I don't know.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  We may be jumping to conclusions what exactly it is they are hiding,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  but they surely are hiding something.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  And what woke me up to all of this was the extraordinary lies they told about Iraq
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  and the reason for the war.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  Well, Rumsfeld says he never said there were WMDs.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  It's an urban legend, Doctor.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  Does it matter if I have him on tape like a hundred times saying it?
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  Well, people who will lie like that will lie about anything.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  And I think that is the point that the public has to come to terms with.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  Has Bush stole the souls of the conservative America
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  because so many of them mindlessly worship him
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  when he is the 180-degree difference from conservatism?
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Well, yes, he has.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  The question is whether he can keep them and whether they wake up.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  You see, most conservatives are fighting old battles.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  They're fighting the Vietnam War over,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  or they're fighting Roe versus Wade over,
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  and they're thinking about Bush in those terms.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  If it dawns on them that they've been deceived in egregious ways
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  and what they've told is just outrageous lies,
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  he may lose them because the Poles are showing now a majority no longer support this war.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  It's possible to change people's minds.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  Well, yeah, you're right, Doctor.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  Conservatives think that if we discard Bush, that means we love Bill Clinton.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  And that's not the case, folks.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  We've got to discard both of these party hierarchies,
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  and we can do that with the help of people like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  Well, you keep raising hell, Alex.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  It never hurts for Americans to raise hell, especially about the government.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  God bless you, sir.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com,

[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfalls,
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA,

[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  We are now into hour number 3.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  It is Monday, the 27th day of June 2005.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  I got a bunch of news on Iraq, a bunch of news on the police state,
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  other whistleblowers on 9-11.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  But in this hour, we're going to take your calls.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  And we've got William Rodriguez, one of the major heroes of 9-11,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  went back into the building to say people had a collapse on him.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  And he was there in the basement when the bombs went off.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  And he sang right before the plane even hit.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  And other witnesses have said that.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  And then he and others were told to shut up about it.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  This is just part of this tapestry of ongoing lies.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  And Greg Zaminski, who is a prolific writer for AmericanFreePress.net,
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  and just squadrons of other websites, his personal website is Arctic Beacon.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  And gentlemen, thanks for holding during that 25-minute interview
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  with former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  You know, when somebody pretty mainstream like Paul Craig Roberts
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  says the official story is a fraud, the globalists have got a big problem,
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  don't they, Greg?
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  Yeah, you know, it's nice to hear Paul's comments.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  And yeah, I mean, when you start getting people on board like this
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  with the credibility of Mr. Roberts and others,
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  the issue is going to have to be addressed.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  And I hope I hear the government start addressing some of these issues.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  I might add one little, on a lighter note, but not really a lighter note.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  There's a play going to be held.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  This is the first one in the country.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  Oh, out in L.A., yeah.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  In Hollywood.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  I just ran a small story on that.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  And hopefully it's going to be the first stage play.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  It's going to be at the Met Theater starting July 17th, a two-hour play on 9-11.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  And it's done by a woman by the name of Sophia Shapkort is her name.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  I believe that's how you pronounce it.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  And she'd be somebody nice to talk to, Alex, so think about that.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  They're doing a play on government involvement, right?
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  Yeah, well, no, it's basically going to go through four segments,
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  demolitions, demolitions, the hijackers, war games,
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  and then I believe the last part is who benefits.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  So it's a real nice, I think they're using the visual medium, you know,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  the visual medium, and they're going to put together a nice little.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  I've seen these plays where they project video behind players on the stage.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  Yeah, they contacted me.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  They want to use William's story as an addition now.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  I saw a Philip K. Dick book.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  Here's what the policeman said that was done with those screens.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  It's a cool way to see a play.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  Yeah, and they're asking me maybe to do like a five-minute intro,
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  so I'm thinking about that right now.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  But that's a lady you should talk to,
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  and hopefully some of the Hollywood stars will get on board to get the word across.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  Well done, Greg.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  Let's bring in Mr. Rodriguez on.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  William, so many people have been standing up and telling the truth,
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  but you were right there.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  You were a victim of this and also a hero of this.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  Hearing Mr. Roberts, Dr. Roberts on, your comments?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  Well, again, it keeps opening new doors,
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  and when you have somebody of that stature,
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  you can stop thinking, wow, this is an ex-high government official
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  who is giving it to you the way it is.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  You know, this is the important thing.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  People like you, Alex.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  People like Greg Simansky.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  People like Jimmy Walter to open their mouths
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  and actually put their reputation against the actual mainstream media.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  This is so important.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  I mean, in my position, I was tried in a way to be bought.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  You know, remember, they called me national hero.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  I was invited to the White House.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  I've been invited to 100 different events.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  I have a room full of decorations from different countries,
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  and it's a way to buy you off.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  And when you don't have a clear mission of where you're going,
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  that you want to actually have the truth in front of you,
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  that's what's going to happen to a lot of the people.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  People were bought left and right.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  And you know, a lot of it isn't even overt.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  It's just, hey, we're your friends.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  Go along with our story.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  Correct.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  A lot of people have been bought off
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  and never really consciously thought about it.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  Stay with us, Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  We want to recap some of the things you've been talking about and take calls.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  Your call is coming up in the next segment, 800-259-9231.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  Give us a call.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  Learn that secret with my new film,
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Marshall Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  Marshall Law plums the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy,
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  Marshall Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  Plum the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy,
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the earth into a prison planet.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  Hello, folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey replacement elements.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  Black Berkey replacement elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  And the Black Berkey filters are recleanable. Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Normally $48 each. You get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine and I want to tell you about the Sacro Wedgie.

[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedgie has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.

[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  Call them. It's only $29.95 and it really works.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  Fellow Patriot broadcaster John Statenhiller had a bad motorcycle accident over the weekend, for those that didn't know.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  He's okay. He broke his collarbone and clavicle and cracked, I think, 11 ribs.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  I talked to his wife this morning. I just learned of it this morning.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  I wish somebody would have called me over the weekend.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  And it's not foul play before the conspiracy theories start.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  Motorcycles are dangerous and there was some gravel or something on a road where they were doing construction.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  She was following him in her van. Or she said following him. I don't know if it was her van. Oh, they have a van.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  There I am adding things. And he just slid out. And it was supposedly in traffic, too, so it's a good thing he didn't get run over.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:18.000]  And got hurt pretty bad. He's got like 12 stitches or 11 stitches somewhere. Again, broke over 10 ribs.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  But he's okay. He's making phone calls in the talk show.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  Just to let you know how transitory life is and how we should all be thankful for it.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  We should pray for John, even though we've differed on quite a few things.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  People were kind of shocked when I called up. I've never been anything bad to say before.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  Other people have about me. I call in. Oh, they're doing okay. Why are you calling?
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  Worrying about people. I'm a nice guy. That's what I do.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:50.000]  I was worried about Clay Douglas. When Clay Douglas had his horrible motorcycle accident, I asked folks to send me money.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  He was really hurt bad. In and out of consciousness for weeks. But thank God John is not that bad off.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  But hey, it shows what you get. You write big news articles about me bad in your magazine, and I say send you money.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  I'm a bad guy, folks. You're going to really learn that as you listen more and more to the show.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  No, I'm being sarcastic. But yeah, these motorcycles, folks, get rid of them.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  I've warned so many people, don't have a motorcycle. I'm not going to handle a wreck. I'm tough.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  Folks, they're deadly dangerous.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  And John is at Breckenridge, and pray for him that he has a speedy recovery.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  And I'm sad it happened to him. He's a pretty good guy.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  Let's go back to our guest. We're talking to Greg Ziminski, who is a prolific writer on 9-11 and other key issues.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  And of course, a hero of 9-11, William Rodriguez. William and Greg, we have a loaded phone. Do you guys want to go to the calls?
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  Yes, of course. Go ahead. Definitely.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  Okay, let's go to Andrew in New York. You are on the air with our guest. Go ahead, Andrew.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  Thank you gentlemen, one and all, for trying to come to some answers for some of us that, well, we need people out there asking questions.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  But I have one quick question, and that is, did anybody save their clothing from when the buildings were exploded for residue testing of explosives?
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  Actually, I have my clothing when I was put from the rubble, and actually after that, I was washed with water from the Hudson River.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  They have a pump to actually take all the debris from your face and your body, and I was actually washed down there.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  But I still have stuff in their pocket, like dust and stuff like that, so I do still have those clothing.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Oh, that's included to get that tested immediately. That's why I love calls. The callers bring up stuff we didn't think of.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  Also, again, let's talk about how they hauled that debris away, even though the victim's family said, please don't do it, it's a cover-up.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  It's not only that. One of the questions on the news two days ago was, what kind of testing do you do?
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  I said, well, we have the actual steel. They said, no, no, no, no. You have the steel almost a year and a half after, because the actual steel was sold to China and Korea.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  It was taken away.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  Phil Berg's written about that in his complaint, and other people have written stories about FEMA's quick actions that day.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  Basically, they were nearby doing some kind of FEMA...
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  Tripod, too.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  Yeah, nearby. As soon as the thing hit, they cordoned that thing off. Nobody got a chance to get the evidence.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  And only their official cameras were allowed to videotape the wreckage.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Yeah, it was a pretty interesting situation, why FEMA blocked everything off. Then they immediately get the rubble out.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  I even had stories where they were so concerned about the rubble that they had GPS tracking on every truck that left.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  And also, a gentleman who was driving a truck, which I haven't been able to verify yet, was supposedly fired for taking an extra-long lunch, and they didn't know where he was.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  No, no, I've confirmed that. I've seen that report.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  Yeah, so basically...
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  Listen, did you know in the Oklahoma City bombing, folks, it blew out?
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  And then the news reported it showed, we're removing bombs, I have all this in road attorney.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  This is key. This is very important.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  That most of the building wasn't destroyed.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  Well, when controlled demolition ink blew it up, blew up the wreckage, they hauled it away under armed guard, buried it in a landfill, poured concrete in with the chunks,
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  and have armed guards with Heckler & Koch MP5s, they're guarding it to this day, ten years later.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Yeah.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Just to add to that, you have, for example, Diane Horning, who has an organization of family members, who is trying to get the actual remains from the city dump,
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  where they put everything from the workplace center, and she has been unsuccessful to get proper burial for these people.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  Yeah, for those that don't know, there were the remains of literally thousands of people in there, and they just know, we're putting it in the dump, and then shipping it to China.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Correct.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  Yeah, basically they covered a crime scene, and even in the simplest, in a single murder in New York, the evidence is not tampered with, and the tapes go up.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  Do you want to know where else they dumped concrete in with the chunks?
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  Waco, 1993, April 19th, they torched the church, inside the church records vault, where they put a shape charge to kill the women and children,
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  and Benton Parton is on record on that as well, from the photos we have of it.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  We built a memorial chapel for all those that died up in Waco, and we had concrete trucks coming.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  Now, I knew they took it to two different landfills.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  I knew they scraped off about a foot of the topsoil, but what I didn't know is, they had it buried in private landfills,
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  and concrete trucks lined up, dumping concrete in with it, trying to, you know, seal it all up,
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  so even archeologists would have trouble getting in a hundred years from now.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  Gentlemen, what does that sound like to you?
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  A cover-up.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  I mean, why do they do this in Oklahoma and Waco, dump concrete in with the chunklets?
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  It's incredible.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  Yeah, Alex, you know, sometimes you've got to take this down to a human level, and I just had this thought.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  I sit here and I write this story about William, and one thing in the back of my mind I think about,
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  and that's, you know, President Bush likes to talk about how he's the president of the people, and the president of NASCAR,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  and he likes to sit and have a beer with everybody, and he can talk to anybody.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  Now, what I'm going to say right now, Mr. President, why don't you sit and have a beer with Mr. Rodriguez
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  and answer some of his questions?
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  That is true, that is true.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  And actually, I'm glad that you mentioned Phil Berg, because actually I put up,
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  I am the plaintiff of the lawsuit against the president.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  It's a recall lawsuit, and people can actually go to the website and petition,
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  sign the petitions of these to go actually to the federal court.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  We are already going to the first level.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  What website is that?
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  It's www.911forthetruth.com.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  911forthetruth.com.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Again, Mr. Rodriguez is on an internet phone, that's why you hear that cutting out.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  We'll give that out again before...
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  Yeah, 911forthetruth.com.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  But if anybody wants to contact me after the show, they can do it through you, through your show,
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  and I'd be available for any kind of questions or any kind of request as long as...
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  Well, we're going to be having you back on, and I want you to send me the substance of the video,
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  and I'll get it out and put it on the web, and millions will see it, because this needs to be seen.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  Let me do a little mini video report that maybe Greg can write about it.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  Let's go to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  Elizabeth, go ahead, you're on the air with Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Go ahead.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  Before I called you, I saw Psalm 74,
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  Have respect under the covenant, for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  And something that I heard this morning on GCN is so disturbing and ominous that I went to prayer,
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  who to reach, you or Dr. Stan or who?
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  And I felt the Lord told me, you are the only one who will bring this out.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  And hearing this good program again, this vital program with Greg and with Mr. Rodriguez,
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  I congratulate him, and very quickly, not to waste your time,
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  what I did hear was Janet C. Phelan, who was a reporter at the St. Monica Daily Press,
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  and she was looking into something very ominous and strange going on with the waterworks that's coming in St. Louis,
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  she said, Vermont and Houston.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  And actually, the title of her thing is Public Extermination Project.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  And she can get no answers, and just like Greg, she can't get the press.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  She resigned after she saw their attitude.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  Now, who is she?
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  All right, she's Janet C. Phelan, P-H-E-L-A-N, and her e-mail address is J-C-
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  Janet, hold on, let's go slower here, because your phone's cutting out.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  Janet what?
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  Janet C. Phelan, P-H-E-L-A-N.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  Oh, I got that, Janet C. Phelan.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  Right, and here's her e-mail address.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  I mean, who is she? Who does she work for?
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  She works for the St. Monica, what am I saying here, St. Monica in California Daily Press.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  Santa Monica.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Santa, yes, okay, I'm a little nervous.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  I waited a long time, and a lot was going on yesterday.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  And she found out about something called a public extermination?
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  Okay, she found out about T-valves being used, and this was happening in the Palisades Park area,
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  and she just now has an article sitting on Henry Waxman's desk requesting that he honor her request to address her.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  I mean, be specific, I mean, just in a nutshell, what is she saying they're doing?
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  All right, there's something going on where they can close off this stuff, these T-valves.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  See, I didn't hear everything.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  Okay, how does that kill us?
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  They can do something with the water, and there was more to it.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  So I really suggest you check with her, jcphelan10 at yahoo.com, jcphelan10 at yahoo.com.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  And, you know, I think this is something that it could be disinformation, but I trust you.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  You don't have a lot of the New Age stuff on your program.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  I believe that you and Dr. San are true blues.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  And what alarmed me was I was just reading in Bob Roseo's book about how at the end of World War II,
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  they found there was enough Zyklon B gas left to kill millions more.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  Look, I'll try to track this down, and I can get at exactly what you're talking about.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  We'll let our guests comment on that.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  If our government will do all this, what else might they do?
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  I think that's kind of the comment.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  Read the labels.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  Also, it may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  It's all natural, earth-friendly.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091, and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year

[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  Hello, folks. Alex Jones here.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  You know, murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites,
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222,
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates,
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black murky purification elements
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium

[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  To the farthest corners of the earth,
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world,
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  and they did.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand,
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  achieve financial independence.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear,
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  Get the Red Book of the U.S. Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  but with real money as your base,
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  liberty will be your fate.

[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  Jack Malone called in.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  We're honored to have him.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  Talk show host comes on right after this broadcast every day at 2 o'clock.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  Jack had a question for Greg Zemenski and for William Rodriguez,
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  one of the heroes of 9-11 blowing the whistle about bombs in the buildings.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  Jack, who would you like to address first?
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  Well, thanks again for putting me on.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  I don't want to take up too much time away from the other listeners.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  I congratulate you and all your guests today for just doing a fantastic job.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  First, William Rodriguez, who was on my program four or five months ago.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  I don't know if I missed it, but he was talking on my program
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  about meeting Muhammad Adda at the World Trade Center
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  and how the 9-11 Commission covered that up.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  And then I'm just going to drop a quick question for Greg Zemenski
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  and I'll get my answers off the air.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  Greg has written a new article on the 2004 vote fraud with some new developments
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  and I'd hope that he would maybe share a little bit of that with the listeners.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  So, Alex, I'll let you go and I'll listen off there.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  Keep up the good work.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  Take care, Jack.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  Yes, Mr. Rodriguez, you say that you might have seen some of the hijackers before 9-11?
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  Commission behind closed doors that I saw.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  It wasn't Muhammad Adda.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  It was Muhammad...
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  I'll tell you what.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  Start over because we didn't have you fed it up right at the first start over.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  Go ahead.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  Okay.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  I did testify for the 9-11 Commission behind closed doors
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  and I told them that I saw one of the hijackers, Muhammad al-Shahiri,
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  not Muhammad Adda, Muhammad al-Shahiri,
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  and that actually he was taking the building because actually on that day
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  I was cleaning the bathrooms in the middle of the complex
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  and he was asking how many public bathrooms were available.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  The Commission investigators were very angry because I told this to the FBI
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  and I kept quiet for several years thinking that there was an official investigation
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  and then I realized that they didn't do anything about the information that I gave them
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  and they were very angry, the investigators,
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  because they said here is not only an eyewitness account
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  that one of the hijackers was inside the building
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  and number two, that they have a second alternate plan
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  which was to actually place bombs in the public bathrooms
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  to actually accelerate the fall of the building.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  Now this is not me saying this.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  This is the actual investigators that are speculating.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  Now the investigators worked for the Commission
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  and the Commission never put that statement on the final report.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  My statement, I don't know how the media found out,
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  the Daily News contacted me that they knew I testified about seeing one of the hijackers.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  They put it on the newspaper as an exclusive
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  and I got only two calls from the national media to talk about it
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  and then it never went on the air.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  And again, this is the incredible thing that on the Latino community,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  I mean I'm from Puerto Rico, but I created the first family group
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  which is the Hispanic Victims Group.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  I went national and then international all over Latin America with all these statements.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  But I mean I've been the subject of over 17 different television specials,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  but all in Spanish, nothing in English.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  It's like the story has been totally ignored in English.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  Total media control, Greg Zemenski?
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  Well, you know, I think it was Jack wasn't it that asked that question about the election?
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Yeah, Jack Blood, yeah.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  Yeah, well that basically is a story about a story and it's very interesting.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  Bob Kohler, who's a well-respected, he works for Tribune Media Services,
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  he's the editor for the subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  and what he does is he edits national columns that go all over the country,
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  but he's also created his own column over the years
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  and basically did a story which said the election was stolen
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  and he sent it out to the papers, so one being the Tribune, one of his customers,
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  and they didn't run it.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  But they chose to run a rebuttal calling him a conspiracy nut.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  Well, this upset Bob and I talked to Bob at length on this story
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  and ran a story about him because I thought it was quite interesting
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  and explained the media hush and cover-up.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  Well, basically Bob was going to write a rebuttal to the rebuttal
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  but decided against it because he didn't want it to seem like just an in-house squabble,
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  but basically finally got a letter to the editor printed at Tribune.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  Well, the story never appeared.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  He said very few people print anything.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  He only has 12 clients across the country, but when he runs stories like that,
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  people don't run them.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  So it shows you basically the Tribune hushes up their own people.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  And he basically said, Bob, is your job in jeopardy?
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  He said, no, but it was a definite body blow
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  and it definitely shows you what's going on in the newsroom today.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  Knocked him down the sweetheart rung and got dropped off some columns.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  What's that?
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  Knocked him down a rung.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  Oh, of course, and Bob, he'd love to have him on.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  He'll tell you what the mainstream, you know,
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  he's one of the few renegades in the mainstream media.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  Well, look, totally clearly, I mean, the Democratic Party is totally corrupt,
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  totally evil, just like the Republicans,
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  but they can't just steal an election.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  They've then got to have Kerry take a dive, which he did do,
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  but clearly Al Gore won in 2000,
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  clearly in November of 2004, John Forbes Kerry won.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  Exactly.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  I mean, look at these approval ratings now.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  But again, it doesn't mean I'm for Kerry or Al Gore.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  It just shows that even when they give us two false choices,
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  they then pick which of the choices we get even when we pick the other one.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  Yes, Banana Republic.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  It's very nice.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  Gentlemen, you want to keep Rodney Shotgun with us?
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  Sure.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  How about you, Mr. Rodriguez?
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  Sure.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  Al, we're really honored to have you, sir.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  We'll give that website out again.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  We'll come back and talk to Mike and Victor and Mark and many others.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  Stay with us.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  We're on the march.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  Sandal season is finally here,
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  If your nails look dark or discolored,
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  now is the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.

[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris,
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  is podiatrist recommended,

[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  to just talk about anything they think is important
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  to reiterate or anything we haven't covered.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  But let's get a lot of these callers out of the way.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  Callers, I'm going to go to you quickly
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  so you have your question or comment ready.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  Mark in Texas, go ahead.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  Hello?
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  Yes, Mark.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  Yes, welcome.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  Welcome, thank you.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  I'm trying to get the exact chronology straight here
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  with Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  He was in the basement at 8.45 in the morning
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  when the first explosion that he felt occurred.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  And then how many seconds after that did the plane get?
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  Probably two or three seconds after that.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  Two or three seconds after that?
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  He gave me the time to think, wow,
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  this is an explosion from one of the electrical generators
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  on the basement.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  Okay.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  That's exactly the time that it took for then the second explosion
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  that came from the top.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  So boom, shake, oh, I bet that's the generators,
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  I bet that's what happened.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  Boom.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  Correct.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  And the second boom was above you.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  And that was the plane?
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  Way above.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  And you could hear it that it was from pretty far away.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  All right.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  Then there was yet another explosion beneath you after that?
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  Another explosion.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  What I was explained was that actually once the plane hit,
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  the wings blew up because he has all the gasoline on the wings.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  So that was several explosions that you heard.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  But then the funny thing is that as I testified,
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  one fact that I haven't talked about is that I have the only master key
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  that was used on the North Tower.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  There were five master keys in the building,
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  and I have one of them.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  And I was followed by the fire department as I went up the stairwells,
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  opening the doors so people could get out from the offices.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  And as I went up, I heard an explosion on the lower floors.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  I'm talking about in between the 20th and the 30th floor.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  And once I got to the 33rd floor, on the 33rd floor,
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  I was by myself because the whole fire unit collapsed on the 27th floor.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  And I continued by myself.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  And then I found a lady on the floor, on the 33rd floor, trembling.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  I stood her up, put her on the stairwell,
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  and then I heard something very strange.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  On the 34th floor, I heard strange movements.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  Now, when I say strange movements, it's like heavy equipment,
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  like dumpsters with those metal wheels being moved around the floor.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  Now, the strange thing is that that floor is an empty,
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  hollowed-out construction floor.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  There was nobody there.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  There was no equipment supposedly on that floor.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  So I got scared because I was by myself.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  So I bypassed that floor with the master key
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  and continued to the other upper floors.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  So I did explain that, and I never got an answer about that.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  And did you hear explosions just before the building collapsed
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  around you at the end, or how did that play out?
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  Yes, well, actually, as I went up the stairwells,
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  I heard a lot of mini explosions.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  And then on the 39th floor, I got up to the 39th floor.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  On the 39th floor, the police officer that was with me on the lower levels
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  actually met me from the opposite stairwell.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  There was three stairwells, A, B, and C.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  I was on the B, and he came from the A staircase,
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  and we met practically in front of the doorframe.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  He was with two firemen, and at that moment,
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  we were talking about what was going to be the next course of action
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  when, boom, we hear the impact on the other building.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  Now, we don't know that it's another plane because we're inside the stairwells.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  So we have no idea what's going on.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  And as we hear the boom on the other building,
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  all of a sudden, we hear pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa on our building.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  And on the radio, we hear, we lost 65, we lost 65,
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  meaning that the 65th floor collapsed one floor on top of the other
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  inside the building up to the sky lobby, which was the 44th floor.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  And that came right after the boom, boom, boom?
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  Correct.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  Because we have firefighters saying it was as if they had detonators.
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:50.000]  It sounded just exactly like that.
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  And what they explained to me was the building was collapsing inside
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000]  before it actually collapsed outside, which it didn't make sense.
[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  Well, that's what it showed, little explosions going down the side,
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000]  then it collapsed.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000]  That's how the controlled demolition happens.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  Thank you for the call, Mark.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  Really good questions.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  I want to get to everybody real fast.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000]  Greg Zemenski, comments?
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  No, go ahead, Alec. Get to your caller.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000]  All right. Let's go to Mike in New York.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  Welcome.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  Mike's been holding for eons and must have decided not to hold any longer.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  Victor in Missouri.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  Victor, go ahead.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  Hey, guys.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  All this Waco, Ruby Ridge, the Murrah Building,
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  all these are symptoms of the real problem, which is that monster in Washington.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  And it feeds on misplaced respect and honor and Federal Reserve notes.
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  And you know how to kill a monster?
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  You stop feeding the damn thing and calling it government.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  Well, it is an organized crime syndicate masquerading as government.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  That's right.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  And as long as we even call it or refer to it as government.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  Well, it's just like the Mafia, too.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  It gives us loans.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  It gives us money.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  It gets us dependent on it, but only for control.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  I really don't think the Mafia is as bad as that thing in Washington.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  Well, it is the Mafia.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  Anyway, if you stop feeding it, it'll die or go away.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  Any comments or questions for our guest?
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  That was it.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  Victor, thank you.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  You're very welcome.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  Mr. Zemensky, any comments on what he just said?
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  Yeah, all I wanted to say was that for a gentleman like this,
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  that we have to take this on a daily basis and continue to have our stories told
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  and to continue on a daily basis.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  Exactly.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  People think it's just instant gratification society of wanting the hamburger in 60 seconds or we get angry.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  Folks, it's going to take time.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  I love that movie, The Guns of Navarone, and then the part two of it.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  Force 10 from Navarone, have you ever seen Force 10 from Navarone?
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  I haven't, no.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  It's the first one.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  Okay, well, Force 10 from Navarone has got a Mr. Harrison Ford in it.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  And the analogy is they bomb the Nazi dam to destroy the army below it.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  This is an analogy of an info war.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  And when they bomb the dam, they expect it to fall right away,
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  but the demolition guy goes, no, it'll take some time.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  This thing, this new world order won't be blown up instantly.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  It's all of us in the info war firing and firing and firing and firing the truth at them day after day relentlessly.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  That is what will bring them down.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  And we're having victories, gentlemen.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  Yeah, I believe that.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  We're all in this story together and we all have parts to play.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  And the most important parts are Mr. Rodriguez continuing to talk and for people continuing to listen,
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  because if they listen to him, then all the other parts of the story will not be quite as confusing.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  And that's what the government hopes to happen.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  Let me add to that, and this is for the radio audience out there.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  I have nothing whatsoever to gain with this.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  It's not even fame because I already was on practically all over the world with this news.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  And the funny thing is that people don't understand that the reason we're doing this, especially me, is a mission.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  I lost 200 friends that work at the building, and they have no voice whatsoever to speak for them.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  So it's my responsibility as a survivor and as a leader now to make those questions available to everybody,
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  not only to those commissions, but to everybody so they could actually scrutinize and look into themselves and say,
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  is this true? Is this what happened?
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  Because going back to what you said before with the gentleman from the former administration of Reagan,
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  what we need to have to actually investigate is an international commission of victims of terrorism
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  that will be totally autonomous of any governmental influence to actually hire our own experts and to see our own evidence
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  and come to our own conclusions and then let the government answer to the conclusions.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  That's the way to do it.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  And I tell you something, we cannot have that commission establishing in the United States.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  And that won't be the end all be all either.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  It's all part of a process, and we should look at who stands to gain from terrorism.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  And I'll say this, and I want both of you to comment on it briefly, then we're going to go back to calls.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  They're not going to stop. The globalists are going to carry out more terror attacks.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  They've said it's going to happen. They stand to gain from it.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  And so we're trying to save more lives by exposing who's behind this and bringing the real perpetrators to justice, Greg.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  Well, yeah, you know, the question always, the people that I talk to a lot, is when is the next shoe going to fall?
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  And the next question becomes where, when and why? And we know it's coming.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  And basically, I think it's time at least to let them know that the charade's up and we know what's going to happen.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  The question is, they stay one step ahead of us, and they have the resources, the power, the control.
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  But if we discredit them and show people who has the motive, then they may not be able to carry out the attack
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  because they'll test the waters and know that we're not going to buy it.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000]  Exactly. And that's why it's important that the critical mass is reached.
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  Because once the critical mass is reached...
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  I think we're reaching that critical mass.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  I think so, too. I think so, too.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  And as this lady who's putting on this play in Hollywood says, it's the second wave now,
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  and she wants to be part of this second wave of people to listen now to the 9-11 story that a lot of us have been talking about for years.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  Well, it's hundreds of waves. I mean, I look at it as a giant juggernaut, a tank coming towards us,
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  and we're all just firing at it with a concerted effort.
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  And it's blaring on its loudspeaker, you can't stop me, I'm invincible.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  But the thing is, smoking, there's fire coming out from underneath it, it's slowing down.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  Let's go to Don in Michigan, then we'll go to Annette and Michael and others.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000]  Don in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  Hello, Alec.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000]  Yes, sir.
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.000]  Yes. Hey, I received notice a few days ago that up here in Jackson, Michigan, on the south side of town,
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000]  there's a park called Sparks Foundation County Park.
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  And inside that county park, inside of a glass cage, is a section of an outer beam from the World Trade Center.
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:23.000]  So I went up to take some pictures over the weekend, and what I found on this beam, like I say, it's inside of a glass cage.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  I did a search on this also, and I found no other beams on display except for one that's at the George Bush Museum.
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  And I took some pictures of this, and I'm going to send them out to you, but I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  It looks, it appears as if the edges, the ends of this beam were sheared off.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  There's no signs of heat, there's no signs of fire, there's still red paint on the beam,
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  and it's identified as, there's a big old number 79 that they spray painted on the side of it.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000]  And I guess my question for...
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  Just think, if they're going to release a beam, they'd sanitize it and make sure it didn't have anything incriminating,
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  but they do make mistakes, most of it, all of it that I knew of was hauled off.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  I know about the beam up at College Station.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  Okay, I understand that, but...
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:18.000]  Can you go to PrisonPlanet.com, it says contact Webmaster Email, that to Paul, and write us a brief description, we'll post it.
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  Okay, and I will also send you some pictures.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  You would have had them by now, but I wanted to get a close-up of the...
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  Well, why don't you start, do you know how to, is it a digital camera or film?
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  No, it's not, no, it's not, it's 35 millimeters.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  Do you know how to scan those?
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.000]  I don't have a scanner, I probably could.
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  I bet your neighbor does, I bet you can scan them.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  I will try to do that.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  Well, I'm not, just mail them and make sure it's got a note with it.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  Okay, excellent.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  Okay, let me get a...
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  I'm sorry, what did you say, Mr. Rodriguez?
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  Anything, anything, because we'll scan it for him.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:54.000]  Okay, okay, have you heard of any other beans on display?
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  Sure.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  I haven't, no.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  There's beans all over the nation, they send beans.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:06.000]  We have in New Jersey, we have in Pennsylvania, we have in California.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  And these are little crop of handos.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  Everywhere.
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  Yes, exactly, and they say that it was, they believe it was from tower number two, and it was found over a block away, 40 feet underground.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  What I will tell you, don't even believe that...
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  Hold on, one at a time.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  I'm sorry, don't even believe that, because once the building collapsed, the beans doesn't have a number, like this belonged to building number one, building number two.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  They're just giving information that is incorrect.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  Correct.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  And...
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  Go ahead.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  Greg, comments?
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  Not specifically on the beams, no.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  There's still concrete in the beam, and like I say, the red paint is still there with a few scratches on it, and that's it.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  It does refer to an explosion on the small temporary plaque that's inside the display.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  It explains the explosion of 911.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  It's not the collapse, it's the explosion.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  And I tried to take a close-up picture of the plaque, and it turned out fuzzy, so I'm going to try to go back up and write it myself or try to get a better picture, but I won't get that to you.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  Don, thank you.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  All right, thank you.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  Very nice of you.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Annette.
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  Annette, where are you calling us from today?
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  I have some additional information.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  Annette, where are you calling us from?
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  Oh, West Virginia.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  Welcome, thank you for calling.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  Go ahead.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  You're welcome.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  I have some additional information with reference to the Janet C. Whalen interview by the Power Hour this morning.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  She brought out that while they have been putting T-valves in the water system to monitor individual buildings, now they have new ones, which they're replacing the old ones,
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  with computerized, they're computerized T-valves so that you can add individually to each building whatever you want to besides water.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  So bringing total control in where they can, and we have official government plans that have been declassified of springs, cities with knockout gas, the government putting stuff in the water supply, so I guess that's what the caller was mentioning?
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  Yes, and she gave her email as Janet C. Whalen, P-H-A-L-E-N, the number 10, at yahoo.com.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  Yeah, we got that part.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  Oh, I see.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  And so what can we, I mean, what was the specifics of the story?
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  Well, that was the specifics.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  She was immediately, well, she resigned because they made it very clear they didn't want her around in the public, the water department on the West Coast.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  I'm not sure of the particular area.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  Okay, so water, you know, I've just got to find out about this specifically instead of just kind of, it'll turn into rumors and then, you know, I'll just have to call David Joyce myself and ask him, okay?
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  Yes, surely.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  Thank you for the call.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  Who's up next here?
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  Mike in New York, you're on the air.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  Hi, thanks.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  Yeah, deductive reasoning tells you they blew these buildings up.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  Here's a question for Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  We're told that the security firm in charge of the World Trade Center complex up through September 10th was headed up by Marvin Bush, President Bush's brother.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  His mother admits that.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  It's been in major newspapers.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  The story first surfaced when Mommy Bush in her book, Reflections, in her autobiography bragged about it, how brave he was.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  Comments, gentlemen, both of you.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  Go ahead, William.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  Well, I heard so many stories about it and, again, you know, we could not continue checking every single angle because there's so many angles that we have here in New York.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  Well, several major newspapers didn't report it's true.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  Yeah, no, no, it's true.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  That's what we heard.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  But, again, we have been bombarded.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  And now, just to remind the people, in New York, we're on the news practically almost every day or twice a week minimum because everything is 9-11 here.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  And we are floated with so much information.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  Well, sir, when you're on the street talking to people, I mean, do most New Yorkers reflect the Zogby poll believing there's government involvement?
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  Oh, yes.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  Oh, yes.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  And the Zogby poll was actually commissioned by Jimmy Walter.
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  I mean, when you're talking to New Yorkers on the street, what do they say?
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  They don't believe the official story.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  This is incredible that the majority of the people like, I mean, the common sense, they said common sense is that, number one, the biggest nation in the world in terms of security, every single agency failed continuously.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  Stay with us.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  We've got to break.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?

[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips, troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?

[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  Before we go back to our guests, take a few final calls for Greg Zaminski and, of course, one of the heroes of 9-11, William Rodriguez.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  I believe it's already sold out, the showing tonight for Marshall Law in South Lamar.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  And I did just get word, because I'd asked for that earlier. Thank you, I'd forgotten to ask about it.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  Yes, it sold out. Did they say when it sold out?
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  Probably sold out yesterday. I knew it was close to selling out yesterday.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  But usually five, ten people don't show up who buy tickets online, and you can usually get in.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  People show up right when it's starting, and they tend to, it's really a bigger, it's like a 230 theater, but they only sell like 215.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:15.000]  They usually hold back a few, so if you live in the area, I don't want you to waste your time if you don't live in the area.
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  You'll probably drive, and maybe still get in. I hate to have you stand in line.
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  But eight o'clock tonight, last show, at least for a while, on Marshall Law, I want to thank all the folks that are coming.
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  If you want a hard copy of Marshall Law to find out what really happened on 9-11, go to MFOWars.com.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  Order a hard copy. This is the bombshell film. This is the documentary.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  I mean, you know, it's not hype, folks. You've heard the reviews by others.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  I mean, it is powerful. It's a toll-free number to get it.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  1-888-253-3139. Call, order it, start making copies, start exposing the globalists that carried out 9-11.

[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:02.000]  Or get a 15-cent a day monthly or yearly subscription at PrisonPlanet.tv and watch them all online.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  All my films, books, a bunch of other films, my weekly TV show, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  Because we're going to run out of time, first I want to thank William Rodriguez, survivor of 9-11, hero of 9-11, who heard the bombs going off.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  I want to thank Greg Zemenski for his tireless efforts to expose this. But let's take a few final calls.
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  Mike in New York, you've got 30 seconds to finish up, then I'm going to Brian.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  Yep, the reason why I asked is because I'm wondering if Mr. Rodriguez has any information or if he knows that anybody has information about an increased activity by that security firm or even private contractors coming into Dwyer.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  Thanks for the call. Yeah, the question is, we heard reports of different floors being shut down for construction and maintenance and drills evacuating the building three times in the month before 9-11.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.000]  Mr. Rodriguez?
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  True.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  You said true. Give us details, please.
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  Well, actually, the building only has drills twice a year, which is stupid. A building that high should have been having drills maybe once a month.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  There was an increase of security and then a decrease of security. They were having shutdown, electrical shutdown in the building prior to 9-11, supposedly to test the machinery on the basement.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  Now we're talking again about the generators. So I got it from the actual mechanical people. So, you know, it is true.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  And they did shut down some of the floors, too?
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  Yes. Well, actually, the whole complex was shut down several days before.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  Ah, very convenient. Let's go ahead and take a final call. Brian, Indiana, quickly. Go ahead, Brian.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  Yeah, I know, Alex, before you talked about that firefighters were told not to talk in favor of their families and stuff like that. I wonder if Mr. Rodriguez had contacted any of these people post 9-11.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  Have you been told by folks that were told, well, he did say they were told to shut up, but was anybody threatened?
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:14.000]  Well, it's not threatened directly. They do it in a subtle way, and it's basically that they tell you not to get into those issues because you're going to get problems with the CIA, the FBI, or everybody involved.
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  Well, that is a threat.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000]  It's better for you to keep quiet.
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000]  All right. Mr. Rodriguez, go ahead.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:29.000]  I want to say thank you for having me on the show, and thank you for Greg who invited me to actually meet you, and you can count on me on any event.
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.000]  Well, God bless you. Listen.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  I will be available.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  Listen, Greg, thanks for coming on, too.
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000]  Hey, thank you, Alex. I really enjoy it.
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000]  Take care, my friend. God bless.
