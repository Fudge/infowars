[00:00.000 --> 00:13.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.440 --> 00:22.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.200 --> 00:31.480]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Friday July 10th 2015 I'm David Knight your
[00:31.480 --> 00:35.160]  host in Austin Alex is going to be joining us at the in the next segment
[00:35.160 --> 00:41.320]  he's got a special report on Vatican coup yeah we're rushing headlong into
[00:41.320 --> 00:46.320]  world government and of course one of the people who's taken point now is the
[00:46.320 --> 00:50.400]  new Pope the I guess he's not new I guess he's been in there a couple of years
[00:50.400 --> 00:56.120]  now but what is new is what the Pope has been doing this year pushing for
[00:56.120 --> 01:00.520]  global governance in the name of climate change and you can see it from the
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.800]  encyclical that he put out a couple of weeks ago it's a middle of June he put
[01:04.800 --> 01:08.760]  out an encyclical it wasn't there were other and again I'm not a Catholic so I
[01:08.760 --> 01:12.240]  can't speak to this but I have some articles we're going to talk about what
[01:12.240 --> 01:16.960]  conservative Catholics are concerned about with this it's amazing to see the
[01:16.960 --> 01:22.040]  silence of the Pope when we have massive sea changes and things like the
[01:22.040 --> 01:25.720]  definition of the family not interested at all in that what he is
[01:25.720 --> 01:31.840]  interested in is restructuring the world in terms of economically and of
[01:31.840 --> 01:35.960]  course as you just saw there if you're watching the feed he was handed a
[01:35.960 --> 01:42.760]  hammer and sickle crucifix in South America was the Bolivian president who
[01:42.760 --> 01:47.520]  handed this to him and of course it's a very appropriate symbolism because
[01:47.520 --> 01:54.160]  communism has always been as strong a persecutor of Christianity as anyone I
[01:54.160 --> 02:01.440]  mean they shut down Christianity a very very jealous God is Marxism and the
[02:01.440 --> 02:07.000]  people who have run it and so to see Christ on a hammer and sickle is not
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.680]  surprising whatsoever and it's not surprising to see it given to this Pope
[02:10.680 --> 02:15.400]  because quite frankly what he is pushing is flat-out Marxism now they came back
[02:15.400 --> 02:19.920]  and said well the Pope was surprised by this and he really did not it's not
[02:19.920 --> 02:26.000]  something that really reflects his ideology nonsense look at what he is
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.520]  saying and of course when the encyclical came out a couple of weeks ago we
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.240]  pointed out that the scientist who was one of the three presenters the day
[02:35.240 --> 02:41.600]  before was also added to the Vatican's scientific advisory council this is a
[02:41.600 --> 02:47.160]  leading man in the field of climate alarmism his name is Schellenhuber he's
[02:47.160 --> 02:53.600]  a German and he has written papers calling for world government a world
[02:53.600 --> 02:59.720]  constitution a world body a world council that would enforce all of this
[02:59.720 --> 03:03.160]  and of course that's precisely what the Pope is saying as well the Pope is
[03:03.160 --> 03:08.360]  saying we can't really control the multinational corporations with national
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.640]  governments anymore that part is true that's very true so he says so what we
[03:12.640 --> 03:16.440]  need is a world government to control the multinational corporations he's got
[03:16.440 --> 03:21.280]  it exactly the opposite it's the multinational corporations that are
[03:21.280 --> 03:27.560]  creating the world government using the national politicians as pawns using the
[03:27.560 --> 03:32.800]  Pope or as he's joining in with them willingly now we also have this as part
[03:32.800 --> 03:36.920]  of Prince Charles was put together an Earth League and you can see pictures of
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.520]  Prince Charles with this advisor Peter Schellenhuber they're going to push
[03:41.520 --> 03:45.600]  this this year this year they have some major economic not economic
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.080]  environmental conferences where they're going to try to push climate change on
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.320]  everyone by a global regime and of course it's just one of the aspects where
[03:56.320 --> 03:59.440]  they're setting up global regimes all the trade treaties that we see being
[03:59.440 --> 04:03.280]  negotiated in secret by these corporate lawyers that we're not allowed to be
[04:03.280 --> 04:06.120]  involved in and there you can see the picture if you're watching at the feed
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.360]  over on the right hand side is Peter Schellenhuber and right there in the
[04:10.360 --> 04:17.200]  center of all this as usual is Prince Charles the League of the Earth League
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.880]  I guess they call it's kind of like that fiction story the League of
[04:21.880 --> 04:25.520]  extraordinary gentlemen well these guys are not extraordinary gentlemen but
[04:25.520 --> 04:28.840]  there are some Jekyll and Hyde's in there that most most definitely but the
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.520]  mask is coming off and we understand what this is about it is flat-out
[04:33.520 --> 04:39.480]  corporatism leading to world government just like the trade treaties that are
[04:39.480 --> 04:43.960]  being done in secret stay with us right after the break we've got a special
[04:43.960 --> 05:03.240]  report from Alex Jones Vatican Co Joe Biggs here with info wars dot com first

[08:18.280 --> 08:27.520]  Alex Jones here with an extremely important in fact urgent analysis and
[08:27.520 --> 08:33.520]  breakdown of what's happening currently first off everyone sees that the world
[08:33.520 --> 08:39.280]  is going through a lot of changes right now and that those changes are not for
[08:39.280 --> 08:44.240]  the best interest of the average person or for national sovereignty and
[08:44.240 --> 08:50.920]  individual free will and out of this spectrum of events escalating Middle
[08:50.920 --> 08:57.160]  East crises Chinese stock meltdowns the situation in Greece amongst all of this
[08:57.160 --> 09:02.480]  we have governments trying to foment sectarian division divide and conquer
[09:02.480 --> 09:10.400]  racial division what is behind it we're about to break down exactly what is
[09:10.400 --> 09:15.240]  behind it today we're going to point fingers we're going to break down
[09:15.240 --> 09:21.560]  exactly who is pulling the strings who is controlling the wheel of the global
[09:21.560 --> 09:28.840]  ship of state the new pope who's been in power now for two years elected by the
[09:28.840 --> 09:33.960]  Cardinals at the Vatican has openly called for planetary government three
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.320]  weeks ago and now calling for planetary carbon taxes and wealth redistribution
[09:39.320 --> 09:45.560]  what's really behind this the fact that a pope would come out and call for
[09:45.560 --> 09:51.800]  things reversing what Pope John Paul the second and others talked about tells
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.560]  Catholics and non-Catholics alike everything we need to know so we're
[09:56.560 --> 09:59.280]  about to go to the bottom of the rabbit hole here ladies and gentlemen and
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.600]  explain exactly what's happening you can debate all day whether the Vatican and
[10:04.600 --> 10:08.080]  Catholic civilization has been a positive or negative thing throughout
[10:08.080 --> 10:11.920]  history it's certainly been both but you can debate whether it was more negative
[10:11.920 --> 10:16.480]  or more positive but you cannot debate that the Catholic Church has been
[10:16.480 --> 10:23.120]  blackmailed infiltrated and taken over we're about to break it all down right
[10:23.120 --> 10:33.240]  now on February 11th 2013 for the first time in modern history in hundreds of
[10:33.240 --> 10:39.720]  years a sitting Pope resigned Pope Benedict he took off and flew away in
[10:39.720 --> 10:46.560]  his helicopter and we weren't told why now there's a lot of different pieces to
[10:46.560 --> 10:50.760]  this and I'm gonna lay them out and let you make your own decision but I've done
[10:50.760 --> 10:54.200]  deep research on the globalist and their operations I understand who they are
[10:54.200 --> 10:59.840]  what their in-game is and it's not one institution it's not the Protestants it's
[10:59.840 --> 11:05.920]  not the Catholics it's not the Jews it's not the masons that run things it is
[11:05.920 --> 11:12.840]  globalist controlling finance and central banking manipulating nation-states off
[11:12.840 --> 11:17.880]  against themselves and playing different existing power blocks off against
[11:17.880 --> 11:22.960]  themselves and through that synthesis they centralized power and are bringing
[11:22.960 --> 11:27.080]  in a corporate fascist world government that's why the Rockefellers founded
[11:27.080 --> 11:32.680]  their modern Vatican the UN above the law with its own cities in different
[11:32.680 --> 11:37.680]  sectors that has diplomatic immunity we're gonna break that down a moment but
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.360]  regardless of where you stand on the whole Catholic issue undoubtedly they
[11:43.360 --> 11:50.720]  broke with all of Catholic history when they put a Jesuit in two years ago
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.200]  that's against canon law you can't have the Jesuits with the police of the
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.880]  Catholic Church ever becoming a Pope because they would use it as a coup d'etat
[11:59.880 --> 12:04.640]  just like Caesar couldn't bring his troops into Rome because obviously he
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.760]  would make himself a dictator it's very simple it's it's why we have posse
[12:09.760 --> 12:15.960]  commentatus so these are facts you can't deny that a he's a Jesuit the new
[12:15.960 --> 12:24.800]  Pope and that he is now saying things diametrically opposed to what Pope John
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.600]  Paul the second and Pope Pius before him and everybody else said that we're
[12:29.600 --> 12:37.640]  clearly anti authoritarianism anti communists and obviously the Catholic
[12:37.640 --> 12:41.000]  Church had its own corruption its own problems I'm not a Catholic I'm not an
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.240]  apologist for it it's just undoubtedly now we have a pope when he first got in
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.160]  that said leave abortion alone quit harping on it I mean he might as well
[12:51.160 --> 12:54.760]  be Margaret Sanger so if you want to understand what's happening it's called
[12:54.760 --> 12:59.200]  blackmail and then I'm going to get into it in a moment the Catholic Church
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.960]  allowed itself to be clearly infiltrated just like the military just like
[13:03.960 --> 13:08.840]  public schools just like so many other institutions Congress by pedophile
[13:08.840 --> 13:13.560]  networks who then once they get somebody in they then recruit unknowns like
[13:13.560 --> 13:18.240]  Dennis Hastert to then come in and fill their ranks then the people are totally
[13:18.240 --> 13:21.760]  compromised and so there was a major pedophile scandal the Catholic Church
[13:21.760 --> 13:27.520]  been covering up for 30 years the whole thing basically began to break the
[13:27.520 --> 13:30.880]  operatives inside that were doing it were blowing the whistle on their own
[13:30.880 --> 13:36.800]  people to then be able to blackmail the Catholic Church into at this critical
[13:36.800 --> 13:42.880]  point bringing in the new Pope who were going to go over in a minute who would
[13:42.880 --> 13:48.720]  then call for class warfare and what has been taught by the communists for over
[13:48.720 --> 13:55.120]  a hundred years liberation theology and the reason this was done is they
[13:55.120 --> 13:59.480]  couldn't get the third world populations a sign on five years ago to the
[13:59.480 --> 14:03.440]  Copenhagen UN climate change treaty that basically double taxes on the third
[14:03.440 --> 14:07.320]  world they promised it as a wealth redistribution but when the treaty came
[14:07.320 --> 14:12.960]  out Lord Moncton got a copy of it a good Catholic himself it was absolute
[14:12.960 --> 14:17.920]  tyranny neocolonialism IMF World Bank raping the third world that they've
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.400]  done over and over again and of course the IMF World Bank support carbon taxes
[14:22.400 --> 14:26.760]  the Vatican supports it it's all the same club Switzerland provides the Swiss
[14:26.760 --> 14:32.600]  guards this is a city above the law with untold wealth lecturing the middle
[14:32.600 --> 14:37.160]  class on how they need to pay more taxes to take care of poor people as if the
[14:37.160 --> 14:40.640]  middle class doesn't already provide most of the jobs so again this is the
[14:40.640 --> 14:45.400]  Catholic Church breaking it down completely blackmailed totally
[14:45.400 --> 14:50.760]  controlled and now pushing an agenda we would expect to hear out of Karl Marx or
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.320]  Joseph Stalin or VI Lenin so let's go ahead and go over some of the evidence
[14:54.320 --> 15:00.280]  right here again we had the papal conclave in 2013 February 11th he
[15:00.280 --> 15:06.880]  announces his resignation they put in the new Pope who is Pope Francis his
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.760]  taken name he's a Jesuit violating Catholic law on every front not allowed
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.520]  to do it but he is his now the so can't have a foreigner be the president
[15:15.520 --> 15:18.920]  basically the same bill you can't have Obama be the head of the UN Security
[15:18.920 --> 15:22.440]  Council but he became it violating article one section nine it's just all
[15:22.440 --> 15:26.480]  about treason now we have an article today and CNN Pope calls world leaders
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.560]  cowards when he's one of the chief world leaders pushing the EU pushing all
[15:30.560 --> 15:33.800]  this and he comes out and says a lot of things that sound reasonable on the
[15:33.800 --> 15:38.720]  surface because they need to get the third world behind him trusting him so
[15:38.720 --> 15:43.240]  they can pass the global carbon tax treaty coming up in a few months in
[15:43.240 --> 15:47.360]  Paris France that openly creates world government and remember just three weeks
[15:47.360 --> 15:52.080]  ago he called for world government and so everyone's praising him he says the
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.400]  systems corrupt you know it's hurting the earth the ultra rich banks are
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.200]  corrupt these trade deals are corrupt it's all true but when you read the fine
[16:00.200 --> 16:05.640]  print the Vatican and him are supporting those deals so again it's
[16:05.640 --> 16:12.520]  rhetoric playing on the ignorance of the public the Treaty of Rome in 1957 signed
[16:12.520 --> 16:21.240]  at the Vatican was pushed by the Vatican to help create the European Union to be
[16:21.240 --> 16:27.040]  a new superstate that they basically control and it was Jesuit operatives on
[16:27.040 --> 16:30.760]  record that helped set it up with the founder of it Prince Bernhardt of the
[16:30.760 --> 16:35.440]  Netherlands you can just look all this up so again he's criticizing
[16:35.440 --> 16:39.960]  globalism when the Vatican has been at the heart of it and then right here at
[16:39.960 --> 16:43.800]  the last moment it's not gonna be capitalist it's gonna be communist let's
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.880]  continue breaking down the biggest secret if you go to the Holy See they
[16:48.880 --> 16:52.880]  explain that they're a sovereign nation above the law that can do whatever it
[16:52.880 --> 16:58.040]  wants there's the official Vatican dot VA website and then you have the city of
[16:58.040 --> 17:02.480]  London with inland and that's above the law pays though taxes is one of the
[17:02.480 --> 17:07.760]  richest cities on earth it copies what the Vatican's doing who else copies that
[17:07.760 --> 17:13.280]  Washington DC established after our country was set up above the law tax
[17:13.280 --> 17:18.560]  exempt doing whatever it wants again the United Nations set up by the Rockefellers
[17:18.560 --> 17:24.040]  given land tax exempt has major capitals in every major region above the law
[17:24.040 --> 17:31.040]  diplomatic community this is the model that they are using this is the system
[17:31.040 --> 17:35.480]  that has been established so regardless of how you see the Vatican good or bad or
[17:35.480 --> 17:41.960]  in between it is an above the law global system with unlimited history and
[17:41.960 --> 17:48.600]  research and spies and operatives with thousands of banks subsidiaries around
[17:48.600 --> 17:54.440]  the world with estimated over 1,000 trillion or a quadrillion dollars and
[17:54.440 --> 17:59.000]  they've got this guy running around lecturing us about wealth redistribution
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.760]  because the ultra rich are going to knock out any economies left he wants to
[18:02.760 --> 18:08.440]  shut down oil drilling everything to create a global collapse of austerity to
[18:08.440 --> 18:15.440]  bring in the answer a world government to it with the new pope now calling for a
[18:15.440 --> 18:20.320]  one-world religion to bring everyone together I mean either the Bible's
[18:20.320 --> 18:25.060]  coming true revelations and Daniel and all the rest of it in Ezekiel and what
[18:25.060 --> 18:30.000]  Christ said or they're using it as a playbook to set up a planetary tyranny
[18:30.000 --> 18:37.480]  three global regions 10 sub regions the 10 kings this is over the top and this
[18:37.480 --> 18:44.200]  new pope is the most naked manipulator I've ever seen he makes Obama look tame
[18:44.200 --> 18:48.640]  with his deception and Catholics are reviled by it people around the world
[18:48.640 --> 18:52.600]  reviled by it but also poor desperate people everywhere hear him with promises
[18:52.600 --> 18:58.960]  of wealth redistribution they buy into it we know for the first time that a pope
[18:58.960 --> 19:04.120]  from outside Europe was put in a I wouldn't be against it the guy wasn't a
[19:04.120 --> 19:10.560]  communist that a pope who is a Jesuit that's illegal under Catholic law has
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.640]  been put in and now he breaks with what the last 10 popes were saying I mean
[19:15.640 --> 19:18.800]  somebody's wrong either those last people were you know horrible or he's
[19:18.800 --> 19:22.320]  horrible and folks are gonna have to face this they're gonna have to deal with it
[19:22.320 --> 19:25.840]  but but the mere fact that you have a pope doing this at this point calling for
[19:25.840 --> 19:29.760]  planetary government again just three weeks ago and calling for global wealth
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.040]  redistribution based on environmentalism this isn't real environmentalism this is
[19:34.040 --> 19:37.400]  the globalist tracking everything you do bringing in feudalism to control you a
[19:37.400 --> 19:41.600]  new dark age and the popes you know saying climate change isn't the sun
[19:41.600 --> 19:45.320]  that's back to saying that the you know earth was a center of the universe I
[19:45.320 --> 19:50.400]  mean this is just too much and so this just adds into the global meltdown on
[19:50.400 --> 19:56.280]  the crises we're seeing accelerate it's unprecedented and we're going to be
[19:56.280 --> 20:01.520]  breaking it down on the radio here today but it's clear that the Vatican has
[20:01.520 --> 20:04.920]  been completely taken over whether it was good or bad before it's completely
[20:04.920 --> 20:09.320]  run by Marxist now who themselves work for big central bankers who are exempt
[20:09.320 --> 20:13.040]  from the high taxes exempt from the regulations just like the city of London
[20:13.040 --> 20:18.600]  just like DC just like Rome just like the Swiss government just like other
[20:18.600 --> 20:23.320]  institutions that model themselves after this they're the new nobility we're the
[20:23.320 --> 20:27.600]  slaves and they lecture the unwashed masses about how communism and
[20:27.600 --> 20:31.640]  socialism will free them when we know it creates a living nightmare this is
[20:31.640 --> 20:35.200]  someone who looks at drowning third world countries and basically throws them
[20:35.200 --> 20:39.080]  bowling balls and tells them that they've been given life rafts I'm gonna
[20:39.080 --> 20:43.960]  throw it back to David Knight here at info wars syndicated radio transmission
[20:43.960 --> 20:47.360]  and of course we also have a Sunday radio show 4 to 6 p.m. where I'll be
[20:47.360 --> 20:50.880]  hosting live as well but this is an unprecedented time to be alive now you
[20:50.880 --> 20:53.880]  have been warned the globals are making their moves on every front their
[20:53.880 --> 20:57.680]  operatives are activating now they're trying to start race war everywhere
[20:57.680 --> 21:01.320]  their their engineering financial collapse it's all rigged this is an
[21:01.320 --> 21:05.280]  incredible time to be alive but for every action there's an opposite and equal
[21:05.280 --> 21:09.440]  reaction Newtonian physics people are ready to wake up right now so spread the
[21:09.440 --> 21:14.240]  word that the good news is this evil has never succeeded before and it will fall
[21:14.240 --> 21:18.800]  this time and that this pope for all intents and purposes fits the bill of the
[21:18.800 --> 21:24.240]  false prophet of revelations Alex Jones for info wars dot com again that's the
[21:24.240 --> 21:30.040]  Vatican coup report that Alex Jones has you can find that on info wars.com to
[21:30.040 --> 21:33.920]  sum up what Alex said the fact that you had for the first time this the
[21:33.920 --> 21:38.080]  predecessor of this pope the previous pope for the first time resigned and left
[21:38.080 --> 21:44.400]  you had a Jesuit come in all of these things very suspicious and now we see
[21:44.400 --> 21:49.360]  the gloves coming off the push for world government you can see the picture of
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.560]  the hammer and sickle crucifix that the pope was given by the president of
[21:53.560 --> 21:57.480]  Bolivia you can see that on info wars.com you can also see that it's a
[21:57.480 --> 22:03.360]  picture up on the drudge report top of the page absolutely amazing picture
[22:03.360 --> 22:08.720]  this is the way RT reports it they say communist crucifix for Pope Francis who
[22:08.720 --> 22:13.720]  lashes out at capitalism on a Bolivian tour some of the things that the pope
[22:13.720 --> 22:18.640]  said truly communitarian economy is what he wants to create based on a
[22:18.640 --> 22:24.440]  distribution of goods amongst us all he said the system is now intolerable let's
[22:24.440 --> 22:28.880]  not be afraid to say it we need change we want change do you see how totally
[22:28.880 --> 22:35.200]  absorbed this pope is in terms of politics and especially Marxist politics
[22:35.200 --> 22:40.040]  and world government politics that's what he is totally focused on and again
[22:40.040 --> 22:44.760]  going back to this in cyclical and it was a very heavy-handed way to put out
[22:44.760 --> 22:48.680]  his comments on the environment it's not something that has typically been a
[22:48.680 --> 22:53.480]  concern of the Catholic Church their concerns have typically been marriage
[22:53.480 --> 22:59.120]  and family and stopping abortion that has been in terms of social aspects that
[22:59.120 --> 23:03.440]  has been the center what has he done about that he has completely ignored
[23:03.440 --> 23:07.600]  abortion he's completely ignored the redefinition of the family had nothing
[23:07.600 --> 23:11.960]  at all to say about it what whatever you think about that issue you must find it
[23:11.960 --> 23:18.040]  strange this sea change and attitude from the Vatican from the pope and then
[23:18.040 --> 23:22.320]  look at who is embracing at the same time again a complete 180 he's embracing
[23:22.320 --> 23:27.320]  this guy Peter Schellenhoeber I'm sorry John Schellenhoeber and if you want to
[23:27.320 --> 23:33.000]  look at his breakdown what this guy's worldview is he wrote a an article on
[23:33.000 --> 23:37.520]  his think tank as opposed to blog post expanding the democracy universe he's
[23:37.520 --> 23:41.960]  says let us incite more democracy they always talk about the common people don't
[23:41.960 --> 23:46.320]  they that is not what this is about this is about world government he says let
[23:46.320 --> 23:51.480]  us incite more democracy says individual lobbyism became increasingly successful
[23:51.480 --> 23:55.840]  and thwarting political action towards climate protection you see it's
[23:55.840 --> 24:00.000]  individual lobbyism if they're not winning and so they need to come up with
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.880]  a collective way to shut all this down here's this collective solution he wants
[24:03.880 --> 24:11.520]  an earth constitution he wants a global council he wants a planetary court to
[24:11.520 --> 24:15.720]  haul people before and of course we're going to get that planetary court we're
[24:15.720 --> 24:19.320]  going to get that earth constitution that's what these trade treaties are
[24:19.320 --> 24:22.960]  going to usher in from an economic standpoint so they're coming at us from
[24:22.960 --> 24:28.560]  an economic presenting themselves as free trade and yet creating a transnational
[24:28.560 --> 24:32.560]  governance council as senator sessions has pointed out that's going to have
[24:32.560 --> 24:36.240]  power over the countries that have created it they're not going to be
[24:36.240 --> 24:40.600]  allowed to see these treaties until just before they have to vote on them
[24:40.600 --> 24:43.680]  they're not going to be allowed to amend them once they are passed this
[24:43.680 --> 24:49.200]  transnational governance council will be able to modify that as they wish and
[24:49.200 --> 24:53.920]  senator sessions is pointing out the fact that this is not just economic this
[24:53.920 --> 24:59.800]  is political and these creations that they've already made the North American
[24:59.800 --> 25:03.800]  Free Trade Agreement which is creating a North American Union the European Union
[25:03.800 --> 25:07.560]  which has already been created they move as we can see in the European Union as
[25:07.560 --> 25:11.160]  we can see in the crisis that's going on with Greece they move from an economic
[25:11.160 --> 25:15.680]  union to a political union by creating crisis that's what we see happening
[25:15.680 --> 25:20.360]  right now that was the formula that was presented by Alan Greenspan by the head
[25:20.360 --> 25:26.480]  of the largest bond company Pemko said they need to surrender sovereignty in
[25:26.480 --> 25:29.360]  order to make this work we're not going to be able to make the currency work we
[25:29.360 --> 25:33.920]  can't have that work unless we have political sovereignty surrendered to
[25:33.920 --> 25:37.360]  the center as well that's the progression that's the way they move this
[25:37.360 --> 25:40.440]  take a look at some of the aspects we've mentioned this before in this
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.680]  environmental encyclical of course this Schellenhuber he is director of the
[25:44.680 --> 25:50.160]  Potsdam Institute for climate impact research that's in Germany understand
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.240]  this is a religion it truly is religion they call people who don't buy into this
[25:56.240 --> 26:01.400]  deniers they present it to you not as evidence they present it to you as a
[26:01.400 --> 26:08.320]  complete system they argue for it in favor of it in terms of this is people of
[26:08.320 --> 26:11.480]  authority that's the same way they present things in a religion they say
[26:11.480 --> 26:15.440]  we are the authorities we're the Pope whatever we're going to present this to
[26:15.440 --> 26:21.000]  you if you don't believe it you're an infidel you're a denier we even had the
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.920]  head of the intergovernmental panel on climate change I see you an organization
[26:24.920 --> 26:30.800]  the IPCC when he just resigned oh and guess what it was a sex scandal that he
[26:30.800 --> 26:34.040]  resigned from as always comes back to that doesn't it just as Alex pointed out
[26:34.040 --> 26:38.800]  he believes that there was a massive blackmail of people within the Catholic
[26:38.800 --> 26:43.440]  Church to make this happen we see that is the way they move this through as he
[26:43.440 --> 26:46.400]  pointed out with Dennis Hastert they find people who are compromised put them
[26:46.400 --> 26:53.240]  in positions of power again when the IPCC IPCC head left he said global
[26:53.240 --> 26:59.840]  warming is my religion my Dharma this guy is now been appointed to the Pontifical
[26:59.840 --> 27:06.240]  Academy of Sciences that's the position that was held by Galileo when they
[27:06.240 --> 27:10.600]  first had the Pontifical Academy of Sciences that Pope shut it down for a
[27:10.600 --> 27:13.320]  couple hundred years because he didn't like the science that they came up with
[27:13.320 --> 27:20.040]  because he had a man-centered view of the universe a world a worth a world
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.760]  centered earth-centered geocentric view of the universe and what we're being
[27:24.760 --> 27:29.680]  presented with now is a man-centered view of climate change forget the Sun you
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.280]  know we know now that the planets go around the Sun but we have to ignore
[27:34.280 --> 27:39.240]  the fact that the Sun is the major influencing factor on our climate
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.880]  because it doesn't fit their political agenda so he wants to talk about the
[27:43.880 --> 27:50.040]  scientists that is now the person who's been appointed to this scientific
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.000]  advisory council for the Pope the person who was presenting his views on the
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.400]  climate he is pushing what he calls a democracy universe and again it is
[27:59.400 --> 28:02.840]  nothing but world government but look at who else is involved in this of course
[28:02.840 --> 28:06.800]  this is the Earth League they're calling for they said science-based action but
[28:06.800 --> 28:11.080]  right there at the center of it we've got Prince Charles I think it's
[28:11.080 --> 28:14.680]  interesting when we look at what Alex was just talking about in terms of how
[28:14.680 --> 28:18.400]  they compromised people with these sexual scandals there is stuff that is
[28:18.400 --> 28:23.680]  still breaking in the UK remember it was just back in March that we had X cops
[28:23.680 --> 28:28.440]  saying that there were people in the royal family part of a pedophile ring
[28:28.440 --> 28:34.200]  but the inquiry was closed to shield Buckingham Palace from the scandal this
[28:34.200 --> 28:39.600]  was in the Daily Mail it was in multiple papers mystery royal was part of a
[28:39.600 --> 28:42.960]  suspected pedophile ring being investigated by Scotland Yard again
[28:42.960 --> 28:46.200]  we've seen this over and over again we saw it with a Jimmy Seville scandal the
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.480]  fact that he was close friends with the royal family but the fact that this guy
[28:50.480 --> 28:55.760]  who was other than his connections to the royal family he was just some
[28:55.760 --> 29:00.800]  comedian on British television yet there were multiple investigations from
[29:00.800 --> 29:04.520]  Scotland Yard people who knew that he was doing this for decades as a pedophile
[29:04.520 --> 29:10.280]  multiple investigations had been shut down after he died the BBC some people in
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.160]  the BBC started doing a documentary the higher-ups in the BBC shut it down you
[29:15.160 --> 29:19.320]  see they compartmentalize people and when that compartmentalization just
[29:19.320 --> 29:22.320]  we always hear people well you know how could the government be involved in
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.120]  these false flag operations or these other things that it just sounds like
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.400]  conspiracy theories it's called compartmentalization and when that
[29:29.400 --> 29:35.120]  compartmentalization bursts they have people at the top to shut it down stay
[29:35.120 --> 29:39.480]  with us when we come back we're going to talk about how self-driving robo cabs
[29:39.480 --> 29:45.040]  are being pushed as a solution to global warming but it's another trend to push
[29:45.040 --> 29:49.360]  for corporate governance and fascism stay with us are gonna be right back we're

[33:28.400 --> 33:34.560]  this Wednesday July 10th 2015 in this last half hour we heard a special report
[33:34.560 --> 33:39.960]  from Alex the Vatican coup as he pointed out in every single instance every
[33:39.960 --> 33:43.200]  problem that is being brought up and of course most of the problems that are
[33:43.200 --> 33:48.120]  pushing for world government are centered around climate change but
[33:48.120 --> 33:52.920]  whether it's climate change protection or whether it's free trade it always
[33:52.920 --> 33:56.880]  seems to be resulting in global governance and we're going to continue to
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.480]  break this down for you because there have been some amazing overreaches this
[34:01.480 --> 34:07.680]  week in terms of trying to justify global governance and corporate fascism
[34:07.680 --> 34:11.680]  this kind of alliance between multinational corporations seeking
[34:11.680 --> 34:17.840]  monopoly over the worldwide production of their goods using governments in
[34:17.840 --> 34:21.600]  every country to do that we're going to take a close look at what's being done
[34:21.600 --> 34:26.320]  with Uber with the Uber taxis and relation to that in just a moment before
[34:26.320 --> 34:29.360]  we do I want to let you know this hour of the Alex Jones show is brought to you
[34:29.360 --> 34:34.280]  by the products that we sell at info wars live.com.com brother our
[34:34.280 --> 34:38.680]  highest quality products things like survival shield X2 nascent iodine if
[34:38.680 --> 34:44.240]  you go to the site you can see we've got over 400 reviews there's 99% of the
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.680]  people that have put reviews up would recommend it to a friend to a family
[34:48.680 --> 34:54.960]  member highly positive nearly 100% we've got a couple of reviews that I want to
[34:54.960 --> 34:58.760]  read to you from some of the people that are there because it's really good to go
[34:58.760 --> 35:03.400]  there and that's what I always do when I go to look at a product I like to even
[35:03.400 --> 35:07.640]  if I don't buy from Amazon I try not to buy Amazon but I will look at their
[35:07.640 --> 35:12.000]  product reviews because I want to know what people have said about it this is
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.840]  what some of the people are saying about survival shield X2 this is Aussie man
[35:16.840 --> 35:20.000]  from South Australia he says I thought I would try this product see if it made a
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.080]  difference wow it did he said within a week of using this I have a clear mind
[35:24.080 --> 35:28.840]  I feel energized even when I'm tired at the end of the day I know I don't know
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.000]  if that makes sense he says but it's true thanks Alex and the team another one
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.240]  from gamer in Alberta Canada says best product I've ever used I will never
[35:37.240 --> 35:41.880]  change to any other nascent iodine this is a high quality product and that's
[35:41.880 --> 35:45.560]  what people are saying on the site I just pointed out we've got over 400 reviews
[35:45.560 --> 35:50.320]  most of them are like that get your bottle of X2 we've got it in stock right
[35:50.320 --> 35:53.560]  now we you know we sell out of things pretty quickly we've got a lot of
[35:53.560 --> 35:57.640]  products that are sold out right now we were sold out of survival shield nascent
[35:57.640 --> 36:01.080]  iodine for quite a while we now have it in stock now's the time for you to stock
[36:01.080 --> 36:07.760]  up you can get it at info wars life.com again that's info wars life.com now
[36:07.760 --> 36:11.560]  what we were talking about just before we had to give the break was these
[36:11.560 --> 36:17.760]  pedophile rings and of course there's connections between the Prince Charles
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.600]  and the Pope who are all pushing global governance this Earth Constitution the
[36:22.600 --> 36:26.840]  Earth League that Prince Charles the Senate but you always notice that all
[36:26.840 --> 36:29.600]  these people who are pushing this as well as the people who are typically in
[36:29.600 --> 36:35.120]  power typically are involved in sex scandals typically pedophile sex
[36:35.120 --> 36:42.040]  scandals the very disturbing story that is just surface this last couple of
[36:42.040 --> 36:47.760]  days from Staffordshire police they're looking at claims that police officers
[36:47.760 --> 36:54.760]  stood by while a girl six years old was raped now this girl is now grown up
[36:54.760 --> 36:59.600]  this happened several decades ago her name is Esther Baker she waived her
[36:59.600 --> 37:04.360]  right to anonymity and she claimed that uniform police officers would stand guard
[37:04.360 --> 37:09.520]  and on occasion even take part in the abuse she says one of them the police
[37:09.520 --> 37:13.880]  officers I knew from church there were a few occasions where they would be in
[37:13.880 --> 37:18.080]  uniform and I kind of knew I learned that when they were in uniform it was
[37:18.080 --> 37:24.560]  going to be a rough night now she has also this is a an investigation that's
[37:24.560 --> 37:29.040]  going on this very broad she says she's concerned that people are going to be
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.880]  killed as a result of this investigation so she's very concerned about that
[37:32.880 --> 37:36.480]  because this does happen when they start to expose these pedophile rings and
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.000]  of course back in March we learned from many sources that were reporting on it
[37:42.000 --> 37:47.680]  at the time in the UK about a royal connection a connection in Buckingham
[37:47.680 --> 37:52.120]  Palace to a pedophile ring and they pointed out that Scotland Yard has been
[37:52.120 --> 37:59.880]  accused of engineering 14 cover-ups of VIP checks child sex abuse they say a
[37:59.880 --> 38:04.080]  member of the royal family was involved in the suspected pedophile ring that's
[38:04.080 --> 38:06.880]  the claim of an ex-policeman the officer said he was told by fellow
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.560]  officers that both a royal and a member of Parliament had both been identified
[38:11.560 --> 38:19.520]  as part of a major child abuse inquiry in the 1980s as Alex pointed out it's
[38:19.520 --> 38:26.160]  it's that's the way they get the goods on people we don't know what they're
[38:26.160 --> 38:29.920]  doing to people in power many times they will find dirt on people after they're
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.120]  in power use that to blackmail them we're very concerned that situations like
[38:34.120 --> 38:36.960]  that have happened in the Supreme Court you have to ask yourself if they have
[38:36.960 --> 38:41.000]  that power of course they would use it that's the kind of people we have in
[38:41.000 --> 38:46.080]  control now and you're kidding yourself if you don't realize that that is one
[38:46.080 --> 38:51.120]  of the many dangers of a government that knows everything about everybody but it
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.280]  doesn't usually work out there's not that just that they're looking for people
[38:54.280 --> 38:57.280]  who are blackmailable they will often go out and find somebody like Dennis
[38:57.280 --> 39:01.880]  Hastert some guy who is at one point he is just a wrestling coach and then all
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.880]  of a sudden he skyrockets to the top of the Republican Party why because he had
[39:06.880 --> 39:12.960]  been compromised and they knew it they knew they could control this guy but
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.680]  every time we look at this just as I pointed out earlier when the Pope is
[39:16.680 --> 39:22.360]  making justification for a global governance what he says is that we need
[39:22.360 --> 39:26.320]  to have this because the multinational corporations have grown too large for
[39:26.320 --> 39:30.360]  the individual countries to control them therefore we need a world government
[39:30.360 --> 39:34.000]  to control the multinational corporations it's not working that way
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.280]  it's actually the multinational corporations who are creating the
[39:38.280 --> 39:43.080]  world government and using the Pope using the politicians who are in power
[39:43.080 --> 39:47.960]  using Prince Charles using the idea of global warming using all of these things
[39:47.960 --> 39:53.480]  the promise of free trade using all of these things to usher in world
[39:53.480 --> 39:58.520]  government here's a good example of this earlier this week we had a study that
[39:58.520 --> 40:06.040]  was posted by an organization I've got it right here it's from it was it was
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.560]  highlighted in National Geographic it was highlighted by NBC by the Washington
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.240]  Post by the Guardian by the Daily Mail here it is it's from nature and climate
[40:16.240 --> 40:21.280]  change this is a it was a study that was done by Lawrence Berkeley National
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.400]  Labs in Berkeley California now in this study what they were telling everybody
[40:25.400 --> 40:29.520]  was that the way that we're going to curb global warming this is the headlines
[40:29.520 --> 40:34.920]  from National Geographic self-driving robo cabs could curb global warming here's
[40:34.920 --> 40:40.000]  the headline from NBC robotic cabs could help to cut greenhouse gas emissions
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.920]  another one from the Washington Post a fleet of robo cabs could dramatically
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.000]  slash vehicle emissions suggest a study and the Guardian electric robo cabs
[40:48.000 --> 40:55.520]  would reduce US greenhouse emissions by 94% why not 94.5% yeah they've got it
[40:55.520 --> 40:59.640]  right down to that let's look at what they're really telling us here this is
[40:59.640 --> 41:06.760]  absolutely amazing basically their their predictions are based on the idea that
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.640]  they can decrease vehicle emissions by making the cabs smaller because they
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.080]  want to make sure that they can only fit one person and you can't carry
[41:16.080 --> 41:18.640]  anything you know forget the pickup truck where you're going to throw your
[41:18.640 --> 41:24.080]  equipment in the back they freak out when they see somebody driving an SUV
[41:24.080 --> 41:27.600]  when the mom's dropped the kids off and she's on her way back home so look at
[41:27.600 --> 41:32.760]  that an entire SUV with only one person in it okay that's horrible or you got a
[41:32.760 --> 41:36.720]  pickup truck where the guy's working and he's got his tools or his equipment in
[41:36.720 --> 41:40.120]  the back you know hey there's only one person in that pickup truck we've got to
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.640]  do something about that and so you know the way they're going to attack this
[41:44.640 --> 41:49.960]  they say is to make the cars so tiny they're going to be so fuel efficient
[41:49.960 --> 41:53.600]  they said the vast majority of car accidents because it's also a safety
[41:53.600 --> 41:57.920]  issue they say the vast majority of car accidents are the result of human error we
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.760]  can take that out of the equation and make the streets a lot safer too of course
[42:00.760 --> 42:05.800]  the problem is is that you're simply going to be replacing human drivers who
[42:05.800 --> 42:10.600]  are on the spot and can react if they're paying attention you're going to replace
[42:10.600 --> 42:15.680]  them with programmers who are trying in advance to anticipate every possible
[42:15.680 --> 42:21.200]  scenario and of course they're also going to be triaging basing making a
[42:21.200 --> 42:26.720]  decision as to whether they should drive the car off the side of the road and
[42:26.720 --> 42:31.920]  kill you instead of killing the five people in the oncoming car because they
[42:31.920 --> 42:35.440]  will be talking to each other vehicle to vehicle communication is coming in just
[42:35.440 --> 42:39.520]  a couple of years being mandated by the Department of Transportation just this
[42:39.520 --> 42:46.320]  year at the South by Southwest Festival I have here they had people from the US
[42:46.320 --> 42:49.200]  Department of Transportation and of course their presentation was about
[42:49.200 --> 42:53.560]  talking cars because that sounds just so cool to talk about talking cars but
[42:53.560 --> 42:56.640]  what they're going to be talking about is you and who they're going to be
[42:56.640 --> 43:01.720]  talking to is the government they're going to be monitoring and watching
[43:01.720 --> 43:06.120]  everything you do now here's what they say in the study they say autonomous
[43:06.120 --> 43:12.120]  taxis are anticipated to be deployed according to each trip's occupancy need
[43:12.120 --> 43:15.600]  we're going to right size it so that's one of their assumptions that we're
[43:15.600 --> 43:19.240]  going to nobody needs to carry anything and everybody's going to be driving
[43:19.240 --> 43:24.160]  individually and of course with everybody in the family taking a taxi an
[43:24.160 --> 43:28.280]  uber taxi nobody's going to win from that except for the owner of uber and
[43:28.280 --> 43:32.040]  it's not even efficient for the environment look the passenger miles
[43:32.040 --> 43:37.480]  per gallon in an SUV is not bad when it's filled up they they understand that
[43:37.480 --> 43:42.560]  that's why they sell us the whole concept of buses except that the buses in the
[43:42.560 --> 43:46.920]  cities except for a few inner cities buses drive around as you well know
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.720]  you've seen them driving around empty that's the problem you buy these
[43:51.720 --> 43:54.280]  expensive buses and they drive around empty so now what they're going to do
[43:54.280 --> 43:57.920]  though they're going to have these uber taxis that are going to be powered they
[43:57.920 --> 44:02.240]  say from an increasingly renewable energy source also it's going to be clean
[44:02.240 --> 44:07.160]  it's going to run from electricity it reminds me of a friend of mine who
[44:07.160 --> 44:13.400]  worked on energy issues and he would go to whenever he'd have a presentation he
[44:13.400 --> 44:18.280]  tell people that he was in favor of all the above and let me slide I just don't
[44:18.280 --> 44:21.520]  like Cole Cole is just too dirty he goes well what's your favorite source of
[44:21.520 --> 44:26.120]  energy well I like electricity because it's clean they have no idea that
[44:26.120 --> 44:30.040]  electricity is not a source of power because they don't think beyond the
[44:30.040 --> 44:33.800]  plug and the wall they don't understand where this is coming from and so most of
[44:33.800 --> 44:38.960]  these analyses are based on the idea that we're going to have something that
[44:38.960 --> 44:43.040]  is very fuel efficient because it's going to be electric and it's going to be
[44:43.040 --> 44:49.040]  small they say the upshot is radical they say between nine out of ten current
[44:49.040 --> 44:52.400]  cars could be removed from the road the research found if these automated
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.600]  vehicles were combined with high capacity public transit because they want
[44:56.600 --> 45:01.080]  to make you dependent on them for movement you want to know how they're
[45:01.080 --> 45:06.760]  going to enforce agenda 21 how are they going to keep people confined in high
[45:06.760 --> 45:11.840]  density into the cities and not get out into the surrounding areas well the way
[45:11.840 --> 45:14.360]  they're going to do that is by controlling your transportation it's
[45:14.360 --> 45:18.520]  going to take three steps number one they're going to make it far more
[45:18.520 --> 45:21.520]  expensive for you to drive your car they're going to raise insurance rates
[45:21.520 --> 45:25.800]  are going to tax you by the mile they're going to require that you buy things
[45:25.800 --> 45:28.760]  like vehicle to vehicle communication they're not going to be content to let
[45:28.760 --> 45:32.880]  you drive the car secondly they're going to offer you a carrot that's the stick
[45:32.880 --> 45:38.120]  then they're going to offer you the carrot the carrot is going to be look we
[45:38.120 --> 45:42.160]  have these self-driving cars from uber and of course we've seen the uber
[45:42.160 --> 45:46.600]  executive Travis forget what his last name is collection they care something
[45:46.600 --> 45:51.280]  other anyway the guy who owns uber has said what makes our cars expensive is
[45:51.280 --> 45:56.880]  that other dude in the car and once he goes away our cars get really cheap and
[45:56.880 --> 46:03.400]  then private ownership goes away except for him he'll own all the cars and he'll
[46:03.400 --> 46:08.200]  work with the government to control your transportation to keep you confined
[46:08.200 --> 46:13.360]  into the inner city because what are you going to do for work AI is going to be
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.040]  taking most of the jobs you're going to be confined in the city you're not going
[46:17.040 --> 46:21.960]  to have much money to even take an uber taxi that's how they're going to
[46:21.960 --> 46:26.400]  control transportation at the same time they were doing all of this there was an
[46:26.400 --> 46:29.320]  article on the Daily Mail which was really interesting because they were
[46:29.320 --> 46:34.000]  saying that electric cars were actually damaging your region and at the same time
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.800]  they had an insert saying but electric self-driving cars are going to save
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.640]  energy and are going to be clean and the premise on all of this was that in
[46:43.640 --> 46:48.040]  certain areas whether generating the electricity in certain areas they're
[46:48.040 --> 46:54.000]  generating it based on old coal plants well fine old coal plants do create
[46:54.000 --> 46:59.800]  pollution however the new ones don't it's not a problem with coal any more
[46:59.800 --> 47:03.200]  than you're going to say that everything is is clean because of
[47:03.200 --> 47:07.440]  electricity it depends on how that electricity is generated and it's not
[47:07.440 --> 47:13.440]  doesn't make any sense to demonize coal per se just because you've got old
[47:13.440 --> 47:18.080]  inefficient dirty factories you could replace those factories rather than
[47:18.080 --> 47:23.200]  giving a $7,500 per car subsidy from the federal government for electric cars
[47:23.200 --> 47:28.240]  or heavily subsidizing some of the other forms of energy but finally one of the
[47:28.240 --> 47:31.640]  things that they're saying is it's going to save so much energy because these
[47:31.640 --> 47:34.440]  things are going to be small and self-defined and lightweight and yet
[47:34.440 --> 47:39.000]  look at this study where they're they're looking at UNC University of North
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.080]  Carolina is exploring automated cars they say people going to look back in a
[47:44.080 --> 47:47.560]  very short time and they're going to say why did all these people ever even want
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.440]  to drive these cars themselves well they've been given grants of 1.3
[47:52.440 --> 47:56.200]  million dollars from GM and the National Science Foundation and what they're
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.120]  concerned about is the computing power they say it sucks up a lot of size a lot
[48:01.120 --> 48:09.360]  of weight a lot of power see those are things that affect your efficiency it
[48:09.360 --> 48:13.480]  also affects your privacy though and that's my big concern with this because
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.000]  as I said it's always the model has always been making people dependent on
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.280]  government that's been the basis of the welfare state that's been the basis of
[48:21.280 --> 48:24.520]  public transportation they want you to be dependent on them to ride their
[48:24.520 --> 48:28.600]  buses to ride their subway people choose to do that that's fine except they
[48:28.600 --> 48:32.320]  don't want you to be able to drive your car because that gives you freedom and
[48:32.320 --> 48:35.440]  independence they don't want you to live in the suburbs because that gives you
[48:35.440 --> 48:39.360]  freedom and independence I remember a city council meeting back in Raleigh about
[48:39.360 --> 48:43.920]  35 years ago I went to and there was a lady there who had city council person
[48:43.920 --> 48:49.760]  she had just gone to Russia and she was just gushing about the Russian subways
[48:49.760 --> 48:53.360]  how she could ride all over Moscow for just a nickel she could go anywhere why
[48:53.360 --> 48:57.760]  can't we have that here she said we need to buy light rail the taxpayers need to
[48:57.760 --> 49:03.080]  pay for that it's like you have no idea what the true cost of that ride was she's
[49:03.080 --> 49:06.560]  looking at the nickel just like that person says I want clean energy I want
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.520]  electricity or they ignore the fact that coal is being generated for their
[49:10.520 --> 49:15.960]  comparison purposes out of factories that are many many decades old she's not
[49:15.960 --> 49:19.880]  looking at the true cost of that but the true cost the true cost is your freedom
[49:19.880 --> 49:25.680]  and that brings us to the third point of the uber taxis again there's the carrot
[49:25.680 --> 49:29.360]  of the uber car that's going to be cheap always there you don't have to own
[49:29.360 --> 49:34.000]  your car there's a stick of making it impossible to financially afford your
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.880]  own personal car and then there's the stick they beat you with which is
[49:38.880 --> 49:42.840]  monopoly pricing once they've driven you out of your car once they have
[49:42.840 --> 49:48.680]  established the uber model of the robo taxi then they're going to beat you with
[49:48.680 --> 49:53.640]  a stick of pricing and you can already see this happening look at this just this
[49:53.640 --> 49:57.480]  week they've got a strike they got a tube strike in London subway strike in
[49:57.480 --> 50:02.120]  London and people are saying it's daylight robbery they're jacking up prices on
[50:02.120 --> 50:08.040]  uber 300 percent that's what they're doing in wake of the strike and we've
[50:08.040 --> 50:11.680]  seen this happening over and over again time at New York Times talked about how
[50:11.680 --> 50:16.040]  on New Year's Eve the guy said well I got a regular taxi drive I took a two-mile
[50:16.040 --> 50:20.680]  trip on New Year's Eve it cost me $13 including tip and he says three hours
[50:20.680 --> 50:23.520]  later is a wee hours in the morning I didn't want to try to catch a taxi for
[50:23.520 --> 50:31.720]  the reverse trip so I called uber said I paid $47 for that trip okay so it's
[50:31.720 --> 50:36.200]  it's they're arbitrating the price based on that it surged pricing so the same
[50:36.200 --> 50:40.760]  thing happened here in Austin around Formula One jacking up prices in many
[50:40.760 --> 50:45.400]  cases several hundred percent we've had people get several hundred dollar
[50:45.400 --> 50:51.400]  rides from uber when you have a monopoly you can charge anything you want so the
[50:51.400 --> 50:55.240]  multinational corporations and uber is a great example of this are working with
[50:55.240 --> 50:59.200]  Wall Street they're working with the government to create a monopoly so they
[50:59.200 --> 51:03.120]  can charge anything they want to control you mark where does the name ghost gun
[51:03.120 --> 51:07.760]  come from you know the ghost ar-15 80% rifle gets ghost what's a ghost gun he
[51:07.760 --> 51:12.000]  says duh they killed ghosts they said really ghost he's yeah said matter of

[54:19.720 --> 54:24.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host joining us later
[54:24.160 --> 54:27.360]  in the show we're gonna be talking to John Rappaport we're gonna be talking
[54:27.360 --> 54:31.320]  about the developments in California of course California is taking the lead in
[54:31.320 --> 54:37.160]  a lot of things a lot of things that we're not too happy about one of one of
[54:37.160 --> 54:44.360]  them of course is the loss of informed consent one of the hallmarks of medical
[54:44.360 --> 54:48.240]  tyranny is to take away people's informed consent that's how you get things
[54:48.240 --> 54:53.160]  like the Tuskegee experiments that's how you get things like we saw at UNC
[54:53.160 --> 54:57.600]  where they were experimenting on people deliberately trying to give them
[54:57.600 --> 55:00.800]  respiratory or heart issues and they were successful in doing that in order
[55:00.800 --> 55:06.200]  to push a regulatory agenda of the EPA we tried to shut that down the judge
[55:06.200 --> 55:08.520]  said no we're not gonna get a restraining order against that and they
[55:08.520 --> 55:14.840]  continued to do these experiments selecting out people who were suffering
[55:14.840 --> 55:19.320]  from respiratory or heart issues exposing directly hooking them up to a
[55:19.320 --> 55:24.480]  diesel tailpipe see when you don't inform people of what's going on when you
[55:24.480 --> 55:29.760]  don't care what their consent is when you say that the greater good is a bigger
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.320]  concern than the individual that's what you wind up getting that's the problem
[55:34.320 --> 55:37.680]  fundamental problem with communism and as we've been talking about in this last
[55:37.680 --> 55:42.840]  hour the fact that we now have a pope who's been presented rightfully so with
[55:42.840 --> 55:49.280]  a hammer and sickle crucifix that should be the symbol of this pope because
[55:49.280 --> 55:52.800]  that's precisely what he is pushing we look at global governance we look at
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.040]  the multinational corporations just understand that it was the German
[55:56.040 --> 56:02.240]  central banker who sent Vladimir Lenin from Switzerland into Russia with ten
[56:02.240 --> 56:08.000]  million dollars of gold in a sealed train how's that that make your head spin
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.840]  the Germans who are supposed to be the rivals of Russia politically and the
[56:13.840 --> 56:18.600]  two countries as well as the rival systems of capitalism or fascism if you
[56:18.600 --> 56:25.160]  wish in Germany and communism in in Russia no it was the German central
[56:25.160 --> 56:32.000]  banker who funded Lenin's revolution and at the same time his brother was in the
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.560]  US working with JP Morgan to secretly establish the Federal Reserve as a
[56:36.560 --> 56:41.120]  private corporation this is the global scheming that goes on with these people
[56:41.120 --> 56:46.040]  this is what we're seeing now with the multiple pronged attack to create a
[56:46.040 --> 56:49.840]  world government that's what we've been talking about this last hour the push
[56:49.840 --> 56:56.280]  for establishing a global governance both by these corporately developed in
[56:56.280 --> 56:59.760]  secret treaties a transatlantic trans-pacific partnership treaties as
[56:59.760 --> 57:05.360]  well as these calls for global governance to stop global warming or what
[57:05.360 --> 57:08.080]  they believe is global warming of course we can't get that information from them
[57:08.080 --> 57:10.480]  they don't want to show us their data they only want to give us their
[57:10.480 --> 57:16.280]  conclusions their models don't work they don't predict what we've seen their
[57:16.280 --> 57:21.320]  models it's absolutely absurd to think that when they can't predict the weather
[57:21.320 --> 57:24.720]  a couple of days in advance accurately that they're going to predict the
[57:24.720 --> 57:30.400]  climate 50 100 years in the future can't be done they're not doing it and the
[57:30.400 --> 57:34.000]  short-term predictions that their models have made have been absolute failures
[57:34.000 --> 57:41.400]  we've seen rises in CO2 we've seen a rise in that and we've not seen a rise in
[57:41.400 --> 57:46.200]  in humidity or temperature that they have predicted and when we ask for their
[57:46.200 --> 57:52.960]  raw data they hide it sounds just like the treaties that we see coming out one
[57:52.960 --> 57:56.320]  of the things that they came out with just yesterday of course there was an
[57:56.320 --> 58:02.080]  article in Daily Mail saying that global warming is killing the bees it's
[58:02.080 --> 58:05.960]  global warming and the way they did this they said that look at this we're
[58:05.960 --> 58:11.440]  seeing a hive collapses are predominantly in southern climates well
[58:11.440 --> 58:16.880]  that may be because that's where most of the agriculture is being done previous
[58:16.880 --> 58:22.800]  studies back in 2014 laid the blame with pesticides particularly neonicotoy
[58:22.800 --> 58:26.880]  nicotoy I think is how they pronounce that and the hive collapse was in the
[58:26.880 --> 58:30.240]  winter nevertheless their conclusion is because of global warming we need to
[58:30.240 --> 58:35.280]  force relocate the bees to the north no they struggle with the winter that's
[58:35.280 --> 58:38.640]  when they're having their hive collapse absolute insanity stay with us we'll be
[58:38.640 --> 58:48.000]  right back thank you for listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today

[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.360]  we're going to have a special report from Alex Jones about attempts in
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:40.840]  California to ban terms husband and wife they're not content to take away our
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.080]  informed consent they're going to come after everything they're not going to
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.680]  leave you with any choice we look at the removal of informed consent and we're
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.520]  going to talk at the bottom of the hour to John Rappaport about what's going on
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:57.240]  in California with that we look about at the people who were taking away your
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.360]  informed consent these are the people who have always supported abortion in the
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.040]  name of being pro-choice yet they don't want you to choose how to take care of
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.640]  your children they don't want you to make the decisions about your family they
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.120]  don't think that you should have any privacy either and it's not just the
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.640]  spying from the NSA no they want to know everything about you they want to
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.280]  control everything about you we've also got an article up on info wars calm
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.800]  school threatens to call DHS if parents show up late you know when I saw this
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.240]  headline I thought that was Department of Homeland Security you know they're
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:34.240]  going to call them no it's actually Department of Health and Human let's
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.960]  say Department of Human Services these are the people who will take away your
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.680]  kids and they say if you are late picking up your children children must be
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.280]  picked up on time this is the memo they sent out we got a picture of it
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.520]  children must be picked up on time if they're not picked up on time we will
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.560]  call the Department of Human Services you'll then will have to pick them up at
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:02:00.600]  court at court the next day they're going to keep them overnight presumably put
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.320]  them in jail they're going to keep them till the next day and you're going to go
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.960]  to court and you know if you're late picking your kids up at school now we
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.920]  just might take them away from you maybe turn them over to a pedophile ring for
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.400]  some of the VIPs I don't know but this is that's out of Oregon and then in
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.040]  California they are trying to ban the terms husband and wife because they
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.040]  discriminate against gay people and this is a broad-based movement this is not
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.000]  just one wacko in California this is legislation has been proposed by over
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.720]  two dozen Democrats in the state that's the way you control people you control
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:43.080]  people with the language as always the high ground in terms of political
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:48.440]  battles they're coming after the family folks they've made no bones about it
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.720]  we've had Melissa Harris Perry is utter name guys I get that right telling us
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.440]  you know you just got to get over this notion of private ownership of children
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.480]  you know you don't own the kids it's the village that's going to raise the
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:09.240]  kids no villages raise monsters villagers villages raise people that see
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.320]  the village as their parents have loyalty only to what the village tells
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.080]  them that's why Plato going all the way back to ancient Greece and Plato's
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.480]  Republic he wanted to take the children away from the family he wanted to
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.560]  destroy the family he wanted he had essentially kind of a brave new world
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.040]  approach and that's what we're seeing coming out of California he wanted
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.320]  people to get so caught up in their personal hedonism that they didn't want
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:37.240]  to have a family number one and number two the kids would not know who their
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.360]  parents were the only loyalty the only stability the only foundation they would
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.360]  have would be the state every dictator throughout history it says give me your
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.160]  children at whatever the ages they all have different ages give them to me
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.160]  though as early as possible I'll keep them for a few years and their mind for
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.240]  life they all understand that that's the way you control subsequent generations
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:06.200]  it's through education that's why it is absolutely imperative strike a blow for
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:12.040]  freedom for civilization educate your own children make sure you take control of
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.880]  their education if you've got to do it collectively with other people I know

[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:19.360]  ladies and gentlemen we face a globalist program a plan to end the human
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.800]  species as we know it and make us asexual or basically non-sexual this was
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:31.640]  written about in 1932 by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World he then wrote the book
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:38.000]  in 1961 Brave New World revisited and gave a speech before his death in 1962
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.680]  that is online it's one hour long at Berkeley admitting the entire plan to
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:49.320]  brainwash everyone breakup families ban single family dwellings and basically
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.960]  put chemicals in the food and water to turn us into asexual jellyfish to then
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.880]  be phased out for population reduction his brother ran the UN UNESCO program and
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.080]  as the founder of the world transhumanist society and a eugenicist he was the
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.760]  head of the eugenics society when he changed the name that's the context here
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:13.160]  and the Russians understand that and talk about it on state-run TV again I'm
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.640]  not saying they're angels but they don't want to commit suicide because they were
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.520]  already under a eugenics program and their population went down by more than
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:26.880]  35% under the Soviet hell without which Andrew Schultz and eats an exposed now
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.400]  in California and in other major states and in cities across the country like
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:39.480]  Portland and Seattle they're announcing bans on building new single family
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.120]  dwellings saying that's racist and hateful that there will be places for a
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.120]  family this isn't this isn't being tolerant this is you existing as bad
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.800]  like the name boys and girls being phased out because it's hateful and not
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.520]  allowed to be used in these major cities and states we just listed California
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:05.880]  has now introduced the bill to ban key words like husband and wife and they're
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.920]  also moving to restrict boy and girl because it's hurtful if you're a boy
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.760]  or a girl someone else might identify as a piece of furniture or
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.040]  trans abled this is a psychological warfare program to go out and empower
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.560]  groups of people so their whole identity is this new thing they are not the
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.320]  bill of rights not the Constitution not family not private property and then
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.800]  once they have this broken strategy that Clinton insider Larry Nichols has
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.160]  talked about once they have everybody balkanized they can take over let's go
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.840]  look at some of these articles that are on info wars dot com right now and then
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.960]  David Knight and others like John Rappaport gonna break it down this is
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.960]  nothing to do with liberal or conservative this is a scientific takeover
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.440]  and that's why they push it everywhere and are pushing it on children to
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.280]  confuse them to disable them to where they are basically mentally ill
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.160]  basket cases who see racism and sexism everywhere toward Jerry Seinfeld says
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.920]  hey we're gonna move back to New York some so you can meet boys you know we're
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.920]  out here in the country you're bored and she says just to say the word boys is
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:16.920]  sexist see that existing is sexist and the Russians I have a clip off Russian
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.480]  TV well it's the big Canadian paper reporting on it with the head minister
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:26.480]  for family affairs saying our species is under attack that's what this is let's
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:34.120]  go see the articles in the video now California itself already banned the
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.440]  term husband and wife in documents but but now they're going to the feds
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.440]  trying to get it banned and then in areas of Europe they actually arrest you if
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:49.200]  you use it so you I'm not joking in England I interviewed Robin Page of the
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.840]  BBC who gave a speech saying rural communities have served the same rights
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:59.240]  as homosexuals and Muslims and he was arrested saying the word homosexual is
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.080]  hateful even though it's a scientific term so this is an inversion of reality
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.720]  so California has already banned the word husband and wife and now they've got a
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:11.160]  bill to completely ban it here's the article Democrats introduced build a
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.360]  ban husband and wife as anti-gay words this is how you take over society
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.920]  through political correctness this is the same thing that was done in Russia the
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.520]  words husband and wife were already deleted from California state law last
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.120]  year in order to accommodate and not hurt anyone's feelings see the existence
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.920]  of husband and wife hurts people just like the existence of the word boy and
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.120]  girl is being banned in school and people are now called purple penguins
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:40.800]  because the existence of boys and girls is hurtful and bad this is not out of
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.560]  control crazy liberals this is psychological warfare setting the
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.560]  precedent to ban words now the Russian population has plunged of course the
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.120]  entire West is having about 1.3 children and so they've got an initiative to
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:59.080]  tax incentives for folks to get married and have kids so they'll be humans well
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:04.600]  now they've created a flag that's the family flag doesn't attack anybody
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.200]  anything and folks of course one that banned and one that restricted so this
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.120]  is a totalitarianism here in the United States ban people criticizing gay
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.560]  marriage and get rid of their free speech put gag orders in on the couple
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.800]  that wouldn't make the cake where they can't talk to the media I mean how does
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.600]  that hold up in court first amendment violation and now in Russia their
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.640]  minister that is overall this says it like it is right here here is the
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:40.640]  piece from the Globe and Mail these are values this is how we live this is how
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:47.920]  we will live to continue as human species oh my gosh it's so terrible and then
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.600]  they go on in the piece to say isn't it horrible why a flag for families and
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:58.520]  then you can look it up it's on info wars.com they have now again in Seattle
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:03.800]  and a bunch of other cities Austin set to push it as well they are now coming
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.280]  out saying they're gonna ban single family dwellings and then when you need
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.880]  to repair of an existing single family dwelling old-fashioned house they're
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.000]  gonna come in and make you divide it move people into it to accommodate
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.040]  immigrant populations you cannot make this up it's on info wars.com if folks
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.280]  want to go look that up for themselves Germany started this five six years ago
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.160]  they banned fireplaces they banned space heaters now California is doing that
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:36.600]  this is a global totalitarian organized program understand that it's not about
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:41.480]  being loving they use our goodwill our innate classical liberalism that came
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.800]  from the West as a psychological warfare tool of virus to get us to just
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.200]  stand down run up a white flag and accept anything they want including
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.400]  sexualizing our children all right back to the live transmission with David
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.720]  night I'll be back live this Sunday Lord willing four to six p.m. with a Sunday
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.040]  transmission if you are watching or listening to this transmission spread
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.000]  the word we have the power we have the will we have the truth we can reverse
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.520]  the scientific technological tyranny that's taking over but it's up to you
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.920]  to activate and realize you are the answer you are the solution with God's
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.720]  help back to David night yeah absolutely what Alex said is it's so true the way
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.840]  they're balkanizing the society because you know we've got a massive economic
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.320]  collapse perhaps on the horizon we're going to talk about that later in the
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.640]  broadcast but to put a bookend on what Alex was just saying you know of course
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.560]  today we had the South Carolina governor signed legislation to remove the
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.760]  Confederate flag from the state capitol so now we're all safe from racism it's
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:46.400]  all over with it was amazing to watch this weeping woman who said she was a
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.120]  descendant of Jefferson Davis yesterday and and take it down a Republican as
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.160]  well she said we are telling if we don't take this down we are telling the
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:00.960]  people of Charleston South Carolina that we don't care that your people were
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.840]  killed because they were killed with the flag that's what she said yeah I thought
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:10.440]  they were shot I thought they were shot by one deranged individual and among
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.680]  part of his derangement is his misunderstanding or adoption of these racist
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:27.000]  ideas we need to understand that we can't banish all southern culture many
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.160]  years ago I had a business that was a video store business and Disney would
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:36.720]  not allow song of the South be sold in the United States they thought it was
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:41.000]  too controversial of course they have no problem using Zippity-Doodle everywhere
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.800]  and in a Disney world but they didn't want song of the South on video in any
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.760]  way shape or form we the only way we could get it was imported laser discs
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:58.120]  from Japan and you know it's a really innocent kind story but they don't want
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:02.480]  us to see that they want to divide us they want us to hate each other play a
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.120]  little bit of a clip of just the beginning of song of the South because I
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:09.960]  want you to hear the character and get a feel for this in case you haven't heard
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:14.320]  in a while play it roll that clip there's other ways of learning about the
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.440]  behind-feet of a mule and getting kicked by shows I'm name reams and just cause
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:26.800]  DJ Tails has bought critters like bear rabbit bear fox that don't mean they
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.200]  ain't the same like can happen to folks so them what can't learn from a tale
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.800]  about critters just ain't got theirs tuned for listening yeah they just have
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.080]  got their ears tuned for listening they don't want to hear they've already got
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.840]  their mind made up they want to balkan eyes society they want to paint
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.440]  everybody from a particular group whether it's some people who want to
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.400]  paint all blacks is bad other people want to paint all white people is bad
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.240]  you should be guilty about the fact that you're white or if you're southern
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:57.120]  you got a you got to feel bad about that gonna feel bad about your southern
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.360]  heritage listen to what else he says continue on with this this is the
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.960]  introduction to one of his songs good play that I was going fishing and I was just thinking
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.720]  how the flowers and critters is curious actually just a little bit before that
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.440]  I'll tell you what he had to say got it skewed up a little bit too far he said
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:19.600]  once upon a time he said it's not your time not my time but it was one time so
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.840]  we have to understand the things that happened 150 years ago some of them
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.800]  are applicable today they show us human nature they show us the nature of
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.560]  government we need to understand if we go back and we look at the history read
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.400]  the writings of the people that lived at that time and that's one of the
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.280]  beautiful things actually about the uncle Remus stories you know they're
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:43.120]  actually a collection of stories folklore from African Americans at the
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.160]  time the guy who put this together was someone he had lived on a plantation as
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.240]  a child they had slaves and he would sit at the feet of the older slaves and
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.360]  listen to the folk tales that they had created he'd loved those folk tales I
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.360]  mean this was he didn't hate those people he loved their stories so much that he
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.280]  put them together in a book and you can see that in the movie I run that clip
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:09.200]  but you went back and you you rewound that clip go ahead
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:21.120]  that's right that was one time and you know it's interesting if when you race
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.800]  the history when you flush it down the memory hole you're losing a lot of rich
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.920]  history on both sides you're losing the history of the people black and white in

[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.640]  John Rappaport in the next segment we're going to be talking about what's going on
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:31.040]  in California with removal of informed consent and of course the social
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.360]  engineering in California is just escalating I mean we had this report
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.000]  from Alex Jones earlier about banning the terms husband and wife as being
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.280]  discriminatory getting rid of the terms boy and girl and of course the rest of
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:50.800]  the left coast the people in Oregon that threatening to call and arrest your
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.920]  children if you're not there on time you can pick them up the next day in court
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.280]  and of course they're going to have a hearing as to whether or not you're a
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.400]  fit parent because you didn't pick your child up at time and time from the school
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.960]  but as we were talking about in the last segment and I want to get back to it
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.920]  because Joe Jennings told me something interesting about Disneyland when he
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.640]  visited in the early 70s before we do I just want to let you know that this
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.760]  segment of the Alex Jones show has been made possible by our products and the
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:21.960]  made in 1776 clothing line everything in the made in 1776 line is made in

[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.200]  slavery let's talk about slavery let's talk about the stuff that's made by
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:42.240]  slave labor in China stuff that's made by slave labor in the prisons here in
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:46.120]  America the private prisons that have agreements with the government to fill
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.760]  them up so they can make stuff with slave labor that's not where our products
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:54.880]  are made we're made in America by people who are workers getting paid for their
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:00.040]  stuff so hang together get the stuff that says made in 1776 because you know
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.080]  that's going to be the next thing that is banned and again
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.320]  Mulan Labe is a great time to get those belt buckles because that's
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.760]  essentially what the Greeks said this last week the Greek people it looks
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.800]  like though however the Greek government the prime minister is not telling them
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.520]  to come and take it he is saying send us some more we're going to play this
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:25.600]  extended pretend game a little bit longer so that's but right now Mulan
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.960]  Labe again the Greeks standing up to overwhelming force and saying we're not
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.280]  going to back down that did happen one point in time it even happened again
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:40.560]  this last weekend that and 1776 times when people stood up against
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.480]  overwhelming odds and took their freedom you can commemorate that you can
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.840]  put it on your clothing wear that line it's made in America and you can start
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:53.040]  people talking about it again go to info wars store.com click on made in 1776
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:58.840]  it's right up there on the left hand side now when we were on break Joe Jennings
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.040]  came in and told me that he went to Disney World in the 1970s and he said
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:09.320]  they had a song of the South ride that then they later took out talks about it
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:15.440]  Joe but wasn't it yeah in the 70s you know as a little I was probably six or
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.720]  seven years old and lived in Anaheim and you know the big treat that you got
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.880]  when he went to Disneyland was you know they had all the rides and they they
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:30.120]  rarely change the rides because it's been there for a long time so in the
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.560]  smaller kids area they had the song of the South ride and it was just it was a
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:40.280]  great little ride it had all the fun characters and all this and as a child
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.040]  you never viewed it as racist or anything you just saw these fun whimsical
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:50.200]  characters so you know years had gone by and we went back to Disneyland and and
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:53.400]  always thought hey you don't want to go on the song of the South ride and we
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.520]  went there and it was completely changed the ride was gone and like I said
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:03.760]  Disneyland hardly ever changed their rides and we asked us well you know
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.720]  where's where's this song of the South ride oh and we asked one of the Disney
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.520]  people oh we don't talk about that ride yeah yeah it's been it's been taken out
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.720]  we got to take that out we got to take out song of the South although they do
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.440]  use the songs from it I thought one of the most beautiful things about it was
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:25.720]  the kids setting at the feet of the older black man him relating these folk
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.680]  stories as an introduction of course it was ahead of its time in the 1940s they
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.680]  had mixed animation mixed with live action everything look at this article
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.800]  that Kit Daniels walked in in the break and said yeah look at the article I
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.560]  just put up unlike the Confederate flag Bill Cosby's Hollywood star is not
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:46.160]  going to be removed because it's quote-unquote historic it's historic not
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:52.080]  the stars and bars but Bill Cosby's star on the Hollywood boulevard even though
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.920]  the we have the rising chorus of people talking about
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:04.040]  drugging women so he could have sex with them raping them using drugs looks like
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:07.960]  that may be reopened into a criminal investigation because now one lady has
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.840]  come up where the statute of limitations has not expired they have a very short
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.400]  statute of limitations on all the stuff I believe that's why Dennis Hastert is
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.120]  getting away with a lot of the stuff that he's got but nevertheless it was so
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:27.240]  egregious that a judge in one of the previous trials opened that up and said he
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:32.280]  admitted to doing this and these sealed records he could stand it no longer so
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:36.200]  there's no question about that but of course that's okay that's okay it's an
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.800]  historic flag the Confederate battle flag that has to be removed we're
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.720]  removing our history we're taking away any signs that black people and white
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:49.200]  people can get along together they can love each other stay with us we'll be
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:55.400]  right back on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:12.000]  infowars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.920]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30

[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:26.520]  live from Austin, Texas it's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:31.400]  David Knight we're gonna be joining John Rappaport in just a moment you know
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.880]  we've been talking about world government being ushered in we've been
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.800]  talking about economic collapse the things that have happened this week in
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:42.800]  China as well as in Greece and of course our government is rapidly
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:47.160]  consolidating an iron fist that's what we're going to talk to John Rappaport
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:51.480]  about is the coming medical tyranny we can see how that's developing just look
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:56.080]  at the way our police act in this country for example we have several
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.680]  headlines here about a week apart here's this first headline from the
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.680]  Washington Post Norwegian cops fired their guns twice last year and didn't
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:07.280]  hit anyone either time then we have a week later one in 13 people in the US
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:12.720]  killed by guns are killed by police and then this headline that just came out
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:17.880]  SWAT raids a wrong home breaks windows then issues a family citation for
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.160]  broken windows this is like something straight out of the movie Brazil where
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:26.400]  they get the wrong person they come in and issue them citations for this but
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.200]  understand that there's another aspect to it it's not just the iron fist of a
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.800]  continuously militarized increasingly militarized police that it and that's
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:41.200]  being driven from a central agenda in Washington that's one aspect of it the
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:45.160]  other aspect of it of course is going to be this medical tyranny that we see
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:50.280]  being established in California first and then they're going to roll that out
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.640]  through the rest of the country because they put out bills all over the country
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:00.000]  at the same time the one in California passed because people there just seem to
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.840]  be accepting of that sort of thing joining us now is John Rappaport he's
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:07.800]  worked as a freelance investigative reporter for over 30 years his website
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:13.560]  is no more fake news calm he has really been following closely what's going on
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:21.240]  in California with SB 277 of course he is very well informed about what's going
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.440]  on with the big pharmaceutical companies and that kind of tyranny but
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:28.440]  specifically we'll talk about the kind of medical tyranny that gets ushered in
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:33.120]  when they take away your informed consent joining us is John Rappaport thank
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:39.920]  you John good to be here thanks so give us your take on what's going on with SB
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.560]  277 and where you see this happening because this is all part of the broader
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.680]  iron fist that's being collectively created to control us isn't it it is
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:55.240]  indeed during the run-up to the passage of Obamcare I warned people about this I
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:02.080]  said it's all connected the vaccines the toxic medical drugs and most of all
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:08.880]  the mandating of all of this treatment on the population to debilitate weaken
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:17.320]  confuse kill large numbers of people I've been reporting on various studies of
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:22.400]  the last seven or eight years about the death toll in America from the medical
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:29.920]  system the medical cartel in America at a conservative rate of 225,000 Americans
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:35.640]  killed by the medical system every year 2.25 million people killed per decade
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:43.800]  this is all documented in the public and it's all connected to the national
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.040]  health insurance plan now because millions more people are going to be
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:52.640]  brought into the system and vaccine mandating is part of this because of
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:37:00.280]  course you're injecting extremely high toxic chemicals and many germs into
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:06.080]  children and adults and putting their immune systems at risk to say the least
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:12.080]  so the thing that happens with the medical cartel is they fly under no
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:17.160]  particular obvious banner they say well we're completely neutral we care about
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.360]  you that's all we want to do is help you and so forth we're not from any
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:26.880]  political party and so forth and so as early as 1987 I was pointing out this
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:33.640]  is the ideal cover story for a gigantic covert up to weaken debilitate destroy
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:40.280]  the resistance in any population to a tyrannical takeover and all of these
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:47.520]  coordinated mandated vaccine laws and bills that we see now popping up and as
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:53.560]  you and I discussed earlier in the week actually the plan to immunize all or
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:38:00.320]  vaccinate all adults in America and catch up on all missed vaccines yes all
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:08.000]  these things are in the works and they're all programmed to really destroy
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.320]  the population and that's the thing that really concerns me too and everybody
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.480]  needs to understand that this is a progressive thing it isn't going to
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.720]  stop just by saying your kids can't go to a private or public school if they
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:24.480]  don't take the vaccines that we dictate when we take them in the way that we
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.160]  say to take them in other words you're not allowed to space these things out
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.520]  you're not allowed to have any delay of that schedule you have to do it on their
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.960]  schedule the vaccines that they dictate to you and so that's the scary thing is
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:40.240]  that they have established and carved out for themselves the presumption that
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:44.240]  they can tell you what to take when you can take it and of course we've seen
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.320]  an explosion in the number of vaccines that they have required people to take
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:54.680]  and this leaves open John the idea that any new vaccine regardless of whether
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:58.160]  it is adequately tested or whatever they could force upon the population
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.880]  children or adults and that's the thing that's really concerning and the thing
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:06.040]  that concerns me about that of course is that there's no incentive for the
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.960]  pharmaceutical companies to really vet their products because they've been
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:15.920]  given legal immunity from damage caused by their vaccines so why wouldn't they
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.800]  want to make every single treatment of vaccine and why would they have any
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:29.080]  incentive to test it let me give you an example of that the coming research and
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:35.880]  vaccines is all about developing synthetic genes that they claim will
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:41.680]  create immunity to diseases and injecting these synthetic genes into the
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:46.280]  body this is not science fiction there's a human trial underway right now
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:50.640]  there have been animal studies done there are researchers busy at work on
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.400]  this and the bottom line on it is that the injection of these synthetic genes
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:03.120]  permanently alters permanently alters your genetic makeup this is not some
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:09.640]  just a visitation by a synthetic gene it takes up permanent residents which now
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:14.360]  we're talking about re-engineering the human species and now you without our
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:19.680]  consent without our consent or even knowledge yes and now you see why
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:24.800]  there's so maniacal about wanting to mandate vaccines well well that is
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.760]  very very concerning also this week we've seen reports about how there are
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:34.040]  one or 200 bio weapon labs throughout the country it was a report that was done
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:38.320]  by USA Today John and the reporter asked is there one in your backyard I mean
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:41.680]  even the in the report you could look at it state by state city by city and see
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:46.400]  where where the labs were and at half of these labs they've had accidents I
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.480]  mean you're talking about bioengineering and I know you covered this quite a bit
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.640]  when we had the Ebola outbreak of course Tulane University which had been at
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:00.400]  the center of the Tuskegee experiments was in Sierra Leone when the this new
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.960]  Ebola outbreak happened and they were thrown out by the government as you
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.280]  reported there because they were concerned that it had perhaps been
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:13.040]  intentionally released or leaked out and we have seen this now documented over
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.240]  and over again we have congressional hearings Senate hearings that are
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:21.460]  happening they want to know why there is such lax control at these bio weapon
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:26.080]  labs where they're bringing in in many cases deadly bacteria and then trying to
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.840]  give them what they call a gain of function making them more deadly
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:35.680]  making them easier to transmit easier for us to contract the diseases the CDC
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.760]  calls them select agents and we need to all understand just how difficult how
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.560]  dangerous this medical experimentation is and how in bed with the pharmaceutical
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.440]  companies the CDC is they're not going to be oversight I mean these are people
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:55.920]  who are working in a military bio weapon type of of a facility to make this
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.960]  stuff happen they're not going to provide the oversight to make sure that
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:04.520]  everything is safe there are even articles now and this goes back decades
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:12.320]  of mailing actually sending through the males miles of these germs that arrive
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:18.120]  in broken packages leaking and so forth the presumption that you know we're
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:22.760]  doing this under enormous rules of safety and so forth is a complete
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:29.720]  roots there are mistakes all the time there are leakages it's a disaster and
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:34.920]  the more of these labs that exist as you pointed out the worst the situation
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.640]  gets I remember you were hard I remember John you were criticized when you
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.360]  suggested that perhaps in Sierra Leone the stuff had had gotten out you know
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:47.720]  certainly the Sierra Leone government thought that you were criticized for
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.040]  saying that they could have let this Ebola escape that that the the labs
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:56.120]  could have been the source of this and yet we see this happening all over the
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:01.280]  country it's not a an unusual event for this to happen all over the US it's
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.440]  just that it hasn't happened with Ebola yet and as your point out there's been
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.120]  multiple articles just within the last few weeks about the Department of
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:14.040]  Defense shipping live anthrax through the regular mail exactly this all goes
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:20.920]  back as well David to animal testing which I covered extensively in my
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:27.000]  first book AIDS Inc facilities all around the United States all around the
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.120]  world where animals are kept in cages and experimented on with all sorts of
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:39.680]  drugs vaccines combinations of germs you know they become germ factories these
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:44.840]  animals and the conditions in these places are horrendous absolutely
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.120]  horrendous so this is a story that has flown below the radar for the last 30 or
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:54.680]  40 years there are certain animal rights activists who have exposed it but it
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:58.840]  really hasn't hit the mainstream and this is an issue that has really been
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:05.080]  kept under the radar yes that's exactly what happened just recently at again at
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.560]  Tulane University National Primates Center they brought in a bacteria that's
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:13.040]  not indigenous to North America it's only found in two countries in the world
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.400]  they brought it into weaponize it they had it in a bio safety level lab 3 and
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:24.000]  somehow it got out into the 500 acres of the National Primates Center and that
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.440]  was a story at the around the beginning toward the end of last year the
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.240]  beginning of this year they sent people in to try to figure out how that had
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:34.320]  happened they didn't come up with a good answer as to how it happened they had
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:38.600]  one of the investigators get contaminated with it they said oh I'm sure
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.960]  she was exposed to that before she got down here the head of the facility said
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.160]  I wouldn't be surprised when you start to look in that because this is a
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.680]  bacteria that embeds itself into the soil into the water and spreads that way
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:53.520]  out so he says I wouldn't be surprised if you find that in the soil and the water
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.280]  and meanwhile someone at the CDC says no you would never find that in North
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:02.280]  America if you find it it's because it escaped from their lab so these are the
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.640]  people that are supposed to be on the watch out for us that are going to
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:09.680]  protect us from any of these new genetically modified vaccines or new
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.280]  vaccines that they come out regardless of whether it's GM or whether it is a
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:18.880]  vaccine that has toxins of unknown toxicity added to it for preservatives
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:22.760]  these are the people that are our watchdogs that are going to be watching
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:27.840]  all this at the same time we see people like in California this Dr. Pan who is
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:32.280]  a senator out there with deep ties and support to the pharmaceutical industry
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:37.760]  enacting this legislation SB 277 which basically gives to the AMA and Big
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:43.680]  Pharma the ability to dictate medical treatments to you. Exactly and you pointed
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.040]  out a very significant thing in an earlier conversation we had this week
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:53.720]  which is now that we're seeing the passage of these mandatory vaccine laws
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.840]  and we know that the pharmaceutical companies have absolutely no liability
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:05.280]  whatsoever for disasters and death and so forth from vaccines the Big Pharma
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:13.120]  people will now begin to call many many many new treatments vaccines even though
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.080]  they aren't because they have complete protection they can foist anything on
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.560]  the public they want to and say well when we inject genes into your body you see
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:28.240]  this is really a vaccine therefore no liability we're protected. Oh absolutely
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.400]  it's a dream come true for them and of course this is the kind of corporate
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.560]  fascism John as you well know that is being ushered in with these trade
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.440]  agreements this is all about the new model for corporatism the new model for
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:47.160]  crony capitalism for economic fascism is not just to run the competition out of
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:51.080]  business by using regulations from the government that was the old game the new
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:55.440]  game is to use the government to hold a gun to your head and force you to buy
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:00.560]  their products so whether it's a vaccine or whether it's their inflated health
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:03.800]  insurance that they want you to get it's that's the game that they're going to be
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.960]  playing and they're going to be using the Trans Pacific transatlantic
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.960]  partnerships that they're running through that's what they're going to do
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:14.000]  they're going to shut down people's information about GMOs they're going to
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.080]  extend their patents on everything not just medicine but on everything so they
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:21.800]  own everything forever they have monopoly control of everything and they can
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:26.360]  use the government to holding under your head and make you buy their product not
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:31.280]  only that but in the Trans Pacific partnership for example a country can
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:36.960]  send a drug a medical drug into another country you know as a product we want to
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:41.560]  sell this product and the country that's importing it says wait a minute the
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.560]  government says we think this drug is dangerous and we don't want to use it on
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:52.400]  our people bang that triggers a corporate tribunal secret tribunal where the
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:57.720]  exporting pharmaceutical company now raises hell about the fact that you
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:02.800]  know under this treaty you have to accept this drug mm-hmm you can't say
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:08.000]  that it's unsafe because we're now all part of the same plug and if we say it's
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.680]  safe it's safe and you have to let it go through or pay you know billions and
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:16.840]  funds so we're going to see more and more dangerous drugs and vaccines
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:22.400]  introduced into the pipeline of major countries all over the world through
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.000]  their quote national health insurance plans which will be forced down the
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.520]  throats of the population and this is not a theory we've already seen this
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.360]  happen because we've seen the same type of mechanism put in place with the
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:37.120]  North American Free Trade Agreement we've seen it put in place with the
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:41.680]  European Union Treaty and of course John when the corporations come in under the
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:47.200]  same mechanism of course it's going to be the same mechanism of these tribunals
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.680]  between the investors and the state they call the investor state arbitration
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:56.920]  it's going to be the same mechanism but on steroids when we go to these new
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.560]  treaties but the way it has already worked we've seen that they will come in
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:05.800]  in the case of Australia was a good example they had a new labeling law on
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.680]  cigarette packages and it was actually being effective or educating people as
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.200]  to the risks of tobacco and people were not buying it but not buying the
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:19.080]  cigarettes and so the so big tobacco went in under these trade agreements and
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.040]  sued the Australian government and said you're either going to take this off
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.600]  you're going to pay us damage for the profits that we lost and I think it's
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:31.640]  interesting that the lawyers who represent the multinational corporations in
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:34.840]  these agreements they call themselves treaty lawyers everybody knows that
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:39.160]  these things are treaties and one of the major frauds is being perpetrated on us
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:44.160]  and both parties are as guilty as sin is to say that this is not a treaty but
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.080]  it's a trade agreement or it's a partnership or it's this or it's that
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:53.440]  or it's a you know it's a pink penguin or whatever it is a treaty whenever you
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.920]  make an agreement like this this is a treaty and it needs to have 67 votes in
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:01.520]  the Senate which they don't have so again they play games with the language
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.680]  but this is the kind of economic fascism we've already seen and we're going to
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.440]  see it far more than this because as Senator Sessions has pointed out there's
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:13.600]  going to be an international committee that is going to set over the nations
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.360]  and tell them what they can and can't do in terms of food in terms of health in
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:25.120]  terms of medicine and that's just the beginning yes it overrides any national
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:30.680]  laws these treaties once they're signed they have sudden precedence over any
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:36.360]  laws that the Congress would pass over any decisions made by appeals courts or
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:41.520]  the Supreme Court it just overrides all of that and of course we can see that in
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:44.840]  the fact that they're doing this in secret that they're not going to allow
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:49.280]  our Congress or any other Congress in any other country to make any adjustments
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:51:01.000]  stay with us can be right back with John Rappaport

[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:25.220]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to John
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:30.540]  Rappaport at no morefakenews.com we're talking about the loss of informed
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:35.720]  consent the danger that that presents to us in terms of medical tyranny before
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:38.280]  we do before we go back to John I would just want to let you know this hour the
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:41.560]  Alex Jones show is brought to you by the high quality products that we sell at
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:47.360]  infowarslife.com products like Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine. It's
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:51.400]  something I take every day. For me it's a no-brainer and it's very easy to take.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.480]  It's a lot of the supplements that we sell are liquid. I like the fact that I
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.360]  can just take them all very quickly, very easily, without having to swallow a lot
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:03.840]  of different pills. I know that I need this in my diet because I know that our
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:09.760]  food has been depleted in many different ways of many vital minerals. Again, if
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:13.160]  you want to get other people's opinions about it, if you want to see what it's

[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.680]  bottle of X2. You can read the 400 reviews at infowarslife.com. That's
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:36.320]  infowarslife.com. Now, John, we were talking about what's going on in
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:40.000]  California in particular and as I watch these hearings and everything, one of
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.800]  the things that bothers me, which also bothers me about the arguments for
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:52.320]  global warming, is that we're never allowed to have a discussion about what's
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:56.760]  really going on, about the data that we see for global warming, about the things
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:01.080]  that we've seen, that the studies that we've seen that show that they're
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:05.880]  not conveying immunity or studies that we have seen showing that they're
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:10.240]  massive adverse effects. We're supposed to just listen to those who are in
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:16.040]  authority and do exactly as they're told. That's the real danger, I think,
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:21.520]  is that people surrender their lives to people in authority. They don't do their
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:25.320]  own research. They don't take control of their lives. They just turn it over to
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:28.880]  the experts and the experts they believe are going to act in their own interest
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:34.080]  yet they have a very hardcore agenda themselves, don't they? Yeah, this is a
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:39.120]  major, major problem that you're talking about. They call it a hearing. We're
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.440]  going to have a public hearing in the state senate about vaccines and about
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:49.000]  mandating them and then you watch it and you're waiting for a substantive
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:55.080]  discussion. Where is the doctor who is saying, look, I want to present evidence
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:00.000]  that contrary to what you may believe, vaccines are not safe and are not
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.240]  effective. Where is that? There are many people out here who are
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:10.520]  quite willing to provide chapter and verse and evidence on this, but they
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:17.040]  never get a hearing. There is never a genuine debate based on data. It's just
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.120]  made to look like a hearing so that people will say, well, they have a
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:25.720]  hearing. Well, there was public comment. Okay, so now they passed the law. Well,
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.480]  that's the best we can do. It's like watching a political campaign, slogans,
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:37.440]  lies, accusations, and then it's all over and people go. It's horrendous and many,
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.480]  many more people have to wake up and do their own research and decide for
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:46.360]  themselves what the truth is and then stand on it. Yeah, we just had a former
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:50.760]  vice president of Pfizer who blew the whistle on this whole process and what
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:54.040]  he said was, you see these studies, these scientific studies, he goes, they
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:58.120]  don't mean anything. He says, you have to understand that these people exist by
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:02.160]  getting grants and he goes, the universities and the government don't
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:05.800]  have anywhere near the funds. They get all their money from big pharmaceuticals
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:09.400]  and he said, there's an implied understanding that when you do your
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:14.400]  study, you're going to find in the way they want you to find to portray their
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:19.280]  product in a positive light. Otherwise you've got no job. That's right,
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:23.200]  absolutely. Thank you so much, John Rappaport, and you can get more of his

[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:26.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones. Welcome
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:31.200]  back to the Alex Jones show on this July 10th, 2015. I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:34.320]  Joining us at the bottom of the hour is going to be Joe Bates. We're going to talk
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:38.960]  about a couple of things. Of course, Jade Helm is coming up very very soon. We're
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:44.040]  also going to talk to him a little bit about the way the Confederate flag issue
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:48.360]  has been handled. And of course, we see whenever there's a shooting, typically
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:52.680]  what people do is they don't focus on the individual. They certainly don't look
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:58.640]  at the fact that they were always taking some kind of psychoactive drug,
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:05.480]  something like a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. They ignore that. That's the
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:10.680]  common thread with all this. They ignore the person. They ignore what drugs they're
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:14.640]  on, but they focus on the gun. Well, he used such and such a gun, so we need to
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.520]  ban those guns. Now they're doing the same thing with the flag. But see, there's a
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.480]  different agenda about this. They have a political agenda. And of course, what's
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:29.180]  troubling is to see that the inanimate objects that are representing this
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:33.040]  agenda, that they're actually trying to balkanize the public. So we're going to
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:37.360]  talk to him a little bit about that as well. There is some good news today. We
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:41.960]  have Maine becoming the sixth constitutional carry state. They just
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.120]  signed a constitutional carry. And if you don't know what constitutional carry
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:49.480]  means, that means that they recognize that you have a right to keep and bear
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:54.440]  arms, period. Okay. That's what the Constitution says. It recognizes that as
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.240]  a fundamental right. It's not a privilege, not a license that you get
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:03.960]  granted. It is a fundamental right. And Maine has now become the sixth state to
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:07.760]  do that. We've had some movement in that direction, even here in Texas. Texas had
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:13.000]  some of the worst carry laws, surprisingly. They had some movement on
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.720]  this earlier this year, but we still are not at constitutional carry. Also, in
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:21.560]  terms of firearms, there's interesting article on USA Today that the Army is
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:26.640]  now considering hollow point bullets for a new pistol. Remember when we were
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.680]  talking about the massive purchase of ammunition, how they're buying billions of
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:35.160]  rounds of ammunition, how that was enough ammunition that would last them for a
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:39.440]  conflict like the Iraq war at its peak for decades. Remember when we talked
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:43.840]  about that? And remember when we pointed out that it was hollow point bullets?
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:49.880]  That that is not something that the military uses. This is all for domestic
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:53.520]  law enforcement consumption. They point out the Army is considering the use of
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:58.280]  expanding and fragmenting ammunition, such as hollow point bullets. Now, they
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:01.640]  say there's a myth out there that expanding and fragmenting bullets are
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:05.360]  prohibited in international armed conflict, but that doesn't make any sense
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:11.240]  now, said a Pentagon spokesman. Yeah, it's not actually a myth. They actually point
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:16.680]  out that this was an 1899 Hague convention rule that on the battlefield,
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:22.680]  you would not use bullets that expand or flatten easily in the human body. So he
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.960]  says, yeah, but we never really signed that. We weren't a signatory on that, but
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:30.400]  everybody agreed to that. And of course, the U.S. Army, even though they didn't
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.800]  sign that, they did not use hollow point bullets because that was an agreement
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:41.240]  that it was inhumane. Nevertheless, every country's law enforcement uses
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:45.680]  hollow point bullets against its own citizens, you see. Hollow point bullets
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:51.680]  at the dum-dum armory in India, they used to call them dum-dums and call them
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:57.400]  hollow points. They were specifically created to do maximum damage for crowd
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:02.120]  control. They were always set up for civilian use. They're a very expensive
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:06.720]  round. That's another aspect of this that we continually pointed out to the
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:11.880]  critics. We could show them the orders from Homeland Security and they would
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:15.680]  ignore that. These massive purchasing orders, they say, well, look, you know,
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:20.680]  this small agency over here bought 50,000 of them. So it's just for training. It's
[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:26.120]  just for target practice. So it makes no sense to use essentially anti-personnel
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:31.040]  bullets, if you want to put it that way, for target training. They're extremely
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.880]  expensive. That's not what they're used for. They're used for crowd control. And
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:38.760]  now this is underscores yet again what we've been saying all along that our
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:42.480]  government is stockpiling hollow point bullets. But I guess now we're going to
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:45.720]  start using them for the military because they're going to start using the
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:51.280]  military on us. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:07.920]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com. Today is July 10th, 2015. Now we are five
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:15.080]  days away from Jade Helm commencing over a number of states just down the road
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:19.880]  in Bastrop. We're expecting troops to converge on this town, conducting
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:24.880]  exercises in people's property. And we now know that the military has released a
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:31.160]  statement saying that media will not be allowed to film these exercises. But they
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:35.840]  keep telling us time and time again that info wars is just crazy. We're out of
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:41.920]  our mind even think or question this exercise. But in previous exercises,
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:47.640]  media has been allowed to film these training events. I would encourage each
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:50.920]  and every single one of you to grab a camera, get off your button, go out and
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:55.680]  film these exercises. They can't keep this from us. We know what's going on.
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:59.280]  We're going to expose it. We're going to bring it down.

[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:30.040]  of the info war. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:34.800]  on this Friday July 10th 2015. One of the articles that I came across today that
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:40.800]  really really disturbed me was the story of a SWAT raid. This is in St. Louis they
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:44.920]  raided the wrong home they break the windows then they issue a family a
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:48.880]  citation for the broken windows. Listen to how this breaks down. The family's
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:54.200]  sitting down for dinner if you've ever seen I read this it was just like straight
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:58.440]  out of the movie Brazil by Terry Gilliam kind of across between 1984 and
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:02.000]  Monty Python's Flying Circus he's one of the guys that was involved in it the
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.600]  American he directed that that film again it this is the kind of dystopia
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:10.160]  dystopia that we live in the kind of dysfunctional dystopia that we live in.
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.280]  They point out the family sitting down to dinner all of a sudden flash grenades
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:17.720]  bang through the house everything starts to explode the front doors kicked down
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:22.320]  armed assailants Russian AR-15 rifles drawing drawn and pointed at Walker and
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:26.440]  his family. These armed and incredibly incompetent dangerous assailants
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:29.600]  according to Free Thought Project were members of the St. Louis Police
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:34.600]  Department SWAT team. Now here's where it gets even more interesting they're at
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:38.640]  the wrong house they realize they're at the wrong house but for two hours they
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:42.640]  go over everything in the house even though this isn't the house of somebody
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:45.960]  who is dealing drugs and and listen to all the conservatives out there just
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:53.520]  understand that this violent intrusion is an enforcement of a UN agenda. You
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:57.320]  think they're not going to get violent with UN Agenda 21? You need to understand
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:03.520]  that the drug war that Richard Nixon declared was ten years after the UN
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:09.120]  created its drug prohibition agenda even having the four schedules of drug drugs
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:13.760]  there. It was verbatim an enactment of the UN Agenda just like we see done with
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:17.880]  the UN Agenda 21. UN comes up with an agenda for getting everybody out of
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:21.800]  their private property forced into the cities and then they leave it up to the
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:25.720]  individual localities to enforce that that's precisely what they did with the
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:29.000]  drug war but nevertheless these people had nothing to do with that they're
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.440]  totally innocent of any of that so they stay there for two hours they said they
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:36.320]  knew they were at the wrong address nevertheless they tore the house apart
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.880]  in search of a non-existent reason to justify what they had done and they
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:45.040]  point out of course that if he had been surprised and tried to defend himself
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:49.920]  as we've seen many people do when your house is invaded by armed people you
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.720]  you're instinct is to defend yourself you get killed and you wind up a
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:56.840]  statistic and that would have been on the nightly news that he was shot while
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:01.560]  he was trying to kill the police forget the fact that they initiate it
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:05.600]  nevertheless this is what they did they couldn't find anything so they called a
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:09.840]  building inspector they couldn't find anything illegal that they could hang on
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:14.280]  these people to justify their raid so they called a building inspector two
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:19.440]  hours later he goes around and he sees broken windows which the SWAT team broke
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:27.480]  and then he gives them a citation for the broken windows SWAT team did okay
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:32.720]  this is the absurdity straight out of Brazil like I said you know is it
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:37.480]  buttle is it total who cares you know we don't make mistakes we just go ahead if
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.320]  you haven't seen that movie you need to see it's one of my all-time favorite
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:45.400]  movies I watch at least once a year anyway this is what happened and this is
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:49.280]  not the first time this has happened in st. Louis they did the same thing
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.320]  raiding the wrong house they had a military-style raid the house is
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:56.720]  destroyed their dog was killed their mother was kidnapped and the reason was
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:01.720]  because they were behind on their gas bill we've seen that happen before a
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:06.800]  few years ago the Department of Education did a armed SWAT team with this is
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:11.840]  when they were not nearly as common as they are now an armed SWAT raid on a
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:18.200]  family where the mother was behind in her student loans a year prior to this
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:22.640]  happening the Washington Post had had looked at the procurements by the
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:27.080]  Department of Education so why are they buying militarized equipment why they
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:30.720]  buying bulletproof vests and helmets and shotguns and all this but why are they
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:34.240]  arming it was the Department of Education arming itself and then within a
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:38.320]  year they you see exactly why because it was their intention to go around and use
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:43.080]  SWAT raids to collect on student loans and it was even worse after they drug
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.480]  these people out drug the husband drug the kids out face down on the ground in
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:51.040]  the middle of the night they found out that the mom hadn't lived there for many
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:58.120]  years it was behind honors school loans is that a reasonable way to come after
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:02.480]  people now of course like I said the Washington Post realized that because
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:06.400]  they looked at the procurements and we've talked about our government buying
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.960]  billions of rounds of ammunition so much that they could fight something at
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.200]  the level of the Iraq war for many decades and we questioned what's going
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:18.320]  on with that and of course they would spend that's just for target practice we
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:21.560]  say no it's not for target practice not that quantity and not the kind of
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.640]  bullets and just as I mentioned in the last segment the US Army this is
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:28.960]  reported by USA Today the US Army is going to now buy hollow points for a new
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:33.520]  pistol that they have because see the Army didn't use hollow points they were
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:38.240]  banned by the Hague Convention of 1899 and they point out well the US didn't
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.280]  sign that nevertheless they abided by that did not use hollow point bullets
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:47.360]  in battle no hollow point bullets were reserved by the domestic police to be
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:51.800]  used against their own citizens in the individual countries and of course they're
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:55.360]  very expensive round they're not something that you would use for target
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:59.760]  practice there's something you use to control the population with a jack
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.960]  boot on their throat this Washington Post article one of 13 people killed by
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:08.600]  guns are killed by police they say that's a rate of about one every nine
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:13.680]  hours or two and a half shootings per day by comparison cops in Germany killed
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:20.000]  only eight people and from 2013 to 2014 two-year period British police didn't
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:26.040]  kill anyone last year okay another story from the Washington Post Norwegian cops
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:31.400]  fired their guns twice last year didn't hit anyone either time yet not in the
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:37.200]  US the cops in the US are responsible for 8% of the gun deaths and then they go
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:41.480]  on to say well it's undoubtedly justifiable in many of these cases or
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:44.920]  in self-defense it's like I have to ask you this question then why is it that the
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:49.840]  other cops and other countries don't feel the need to kill people in self-defense
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:54.200]  why is it they don't feel that that's justifiable it's because it's the way
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:58.240]  they're being trained now the training is very different now for the police than
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:03.600]  it was not too long ago again back in New Mexico when there was the shootings
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:06.960]  many of the shootings came to light that people in Albuquerque being shot at a
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:10.360]  higher rate even than in New York City when you normalized it for the
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.960]  population we had that that shooting that went viral of the homeless man in
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:17.920]  the hills so everybody started focusing on that but they'd been in best been
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:24.520]  under investigation for that prior to that it was in the state the New
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:29.640]  Mexico State Police Training Academy that they put in what one of the long-term
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:33.080]  instructors called a shoot first curriculum this is something that's
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:37.120]  being driven from Washington this is an agenda that's coming out of Washington
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:40.720]  this militarization of the police just like they're putting the MRAPS and all
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.600]  these small-town police departments they are training them to act this way to
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:50.560]  shoot first to come after civilians like this that instructor who'd worked there
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:54.080]  for many decades blew the whistle on it and he refused to teach that curriculum
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:58.040]  and he resigned but now the people who've taken his place they're going to
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:01.560]  teach that curriculum because that's the way it is is working in the United
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:06.960]  States and of course that is part of the control that is coming down the
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:13.120]  iron fist that is going to enforce the law as we are staring at economic
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:16.960]  collapse again what's going on in China we've had this that's massive movement
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:20.280]  this week with China and with Greece here's something that puts it in
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:24.960]  perspective this is for market watch they say China's stock market crash it's
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:29.520]  just the beginning they say the Chi next index which is one of their stock
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:35.160]  market index lost 42% of its value over the last 21 days it wasn't just this
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:38.760]  crash the beginning of this week they say investors and traders who piled into
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:43.160]  Chinese shares over the past year caused a Shanghai to raise 150%
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:48.160]  other markets to catapult even more dramatically then they faced margin
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:53.080]  calls because they were highly leveraged just like 1929 remember the the feeding
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:58.080]  frenzy in 1929 everybody was buying everything on on margin and people were
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:02.240]  saying hey you know the the shoe shine boy just went down and bought stocks that
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:06.720]  is what that is what has fueled what's going on in China and of course this is
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:10.080]  something that is tied to the derivatives market which was what caused
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:15.800]  the 2008 collapse which was put on to the various countries like Greece that
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:20.640]  made their sovereign debt so unsustainable like it's all connected it's
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:25.640]  all related and the chickens are coming home to roost they say Shanghai opened up
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:31.360]  strongly at eight and a half percent by Monday despite Greece's no vote they said
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:35.600]  but then shares slipped through the out the trading day and closed up only two
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:40.520]  and a half percent that was a clear sign that the government had taken its best
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:46.040]  shot and failed they point out secular bear markets features sudden violent
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:50.000]  rallies and then many bull markets will come in that will fool people into
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.440]  thinking that they're the genuine article that it's all over with it's also
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:58.800]  called a dead cat bounce and that may be what we're seeing with some of these
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:04.120]  small movements here they say the Great Recession and a domestic real estate
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:08.960]  bust are the fundamentals behind what's going on in China and I remember at the
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:12.800]  end of the year I had an interview with Gerald Salenty and he sat there with a
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:17.760]  paper out of China and he said look at this this is a massive real estate
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:20.680]  bubble they understand what's going on in China they're very alarmed about it in
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:22.920]  the Chinese press but he goes you don't see anything about it in the New York
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:25.480]  Times you don't see anything about in the Wall Street Journal you don't see
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:30.160]  anything about it in any of the US papers and he said this is going to come
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.600]  home to roost and we're starting to see that that's why many people don't believe
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:40.960]  that this was this this crash was something that is just temporary they've
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:47.120]  also pointed out that this was equivalent to losing the entire economy of
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:52.600]  India this this wipeout that came out the amount of equity that was lost was
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:58.760]  equivalent to the economy of India absolutely amazing they say China has
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:04.200]  lost the equivalent of 15 greases and their market capitalization just in three
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:07.840]  weeks in other words the value of the of the stock market in China has gone down
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:15.200]  15 times the size of the entire grease economy this is also another article up
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:21.120]  on info wars.com why China has no choice but to arrest the sellers they say after
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:25.400]  dozens of separate interventions manipulations central planning machinations
[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:29.000]  over the last three weeks China has resorted to threats calling for the
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.920]  arrest of hostile short sellers so the reason they went this or so Orwellian
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:38.240]  is because they have lost so much money and there was a zero hit that's a zero
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:42.960]  ahead article there was one earlier in the week where they had some jokes of
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:47.400]  people showing pictures of a Chinese guy saying I didn't swear I didn't sell I
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:50.640]  swear I didn't sell so this is what they're going to do they're going to
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:54.360]  start arresting people who sell their stocks because that's the way the
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:59.800]  communists do things stay with us we'll be right back with more economic news

[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:41.960]  course Greece is a very small problem compared to China China's two trillion
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:45.280]  dollar loss in just the last 17 days is the equivalent to losing the entire
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:49.800]  economy of India this is from the article by zero hedge on info wars calm
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:54.520]  why China has no choice but to arrest the sellers they also point out it's the
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:00.400]  equivalent to losing 15 greases in the same amount of time it looks like there
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:08.600]  is now an agreement with that Germany is now going to look favorably upon the
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:15.560]  extend and pretend offer from the Greek Prime Minister Cyprus it was interesting
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:18.760]  earlier this week we all got very excited when the Greek people said you
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:22.280]  know we don't want to keep going further and further into debt with these
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:25.320]  bankers who are starving and blackmailing us and of course they are
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:28.760]  starving them they're starving them of capital they're starving them of
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:34.040]  liquidity so they said no to the deal and it was interesting I think when Alex
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:40.320]  played the clips of my Nigel Farage and he was saying leave with your head held
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:46.360]  high get out of this and they kept cutting back and forth from what the
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:50.920]  inspirational words I thought Nigel Farage because you know he's he's of the
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:54.280]  viewpoint that everybody needs to we need to have government that is
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:57.960]  decentralized where people control their lives and yet as they cut back and
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:01.760]  forth between these different between him speaking they would cut back to the
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:05.920]  Greek Prime Minister and he had his head down he looked very angry and I kind of
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:10.720]  got a feel at that time that he really wasn't he didn't really have his heart
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:18.200]  in to leaving this he really didn't want to take the independence route that he
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:21.120]  wanted to strike an agreement with them I thought it was very interesting you know
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:24.280]  a couple of weeks ago it was not this last weekend when they had the vote but
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:31.440]  the previous weekend in the morning the Greek Finance Minister Janus Verifakis
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:35.400]  had said we're not going to put any capital controls on by that night they
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.720]  had capital controls on and then through the week he said look if the people vote
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:44.560]  to accept this deal from the European Union from the European Central Bank the
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:50.440]  IMF I'm gonna resign well they didn't but he still resigned and I don't know I
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:54.120]  don't know what's going on inside there I haven't I have any special inside
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:58.800]  knowledge I'm just looking at this and thinking perhaps he's of a different
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:03.760]  mind than this guy who's a Prime Minister there Cyprus maybe he doesn't
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:06.840]  want to go along that route you know in a couple a couple of months ago he was
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:12.360]  writing things like this Greece will adopt Bitcoin if there's no deal you're
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:15.200]  talking about how they were going to go to a different currency and it wasn't so
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:18.880]  much what he had to say about Bitcoin that was interesting but the fact that
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:24.040]  he laid out for people who were critical of that that he said like you need to
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:27.520]  understand what goes on with the depression with a depression prices are
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:33.040]  falling when somebody orders materials to make their products prices are
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.360]  continually falling prices are falling for their finished good by the time they
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:42.600]  get those raw materials and make their product and then go to sell it the
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:46.600]  prices dropped they may already be in the red they may not be able to recover
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:49.760]  what they have paid for the raw materials and what gets even worse is
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:53.360]  people understand that the prices are falling so they put off their purchases
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:58.240]  and that makes it even more difficult to sell that's why you have a massive
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:02.440]  economic collapse that's why everybody is so afraid of deflation that's what
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:06.040]  brings on things like the Great Depression and so he was pointing out
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:09.880]  that they needed liquidity they needed cash one of the ways that they would do
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:13.320]  that he suggested was maybe to use something like Bitcoin some kind of a
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:19.440]  cryptocurrency that they could operate outside of the European Union outside of
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:22.720]  the central banks outside of the bondholders that they would create
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:26.880]  something that he called a future tax coin that doesn't sound very attractive
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.560]  but it would essentially have been a bond you buy it for let's say a thousand
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:35.520]  euros is that example he gave and in two years you sell it back to them for 1500
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:40.640]  euros of tax credit that would be a way for them to get liquidity away for them
[02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:44.560]  to get money because they are being starved by the central bank stay with
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:53.640]  us we're gonna be right back we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones

[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:09.680]  what they've done in America no this is not a joke it is a huge exercise in white
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:14.280]  guilt-tripping for public consumption the documentary white people shows young
[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:18.320]  Americans crying over their white privilege and expressing angst about

[02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:37.520]  settlers did not save the country rather they invaded and took now all that might
[02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:42.560]  be true the teenagers featured in the show were born centuries after this took

[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:17.280]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:23.680]  network
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:27.080]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show and the last segment we started talking
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:31.960]  about the economics of what's happening in Greece and although it is much much
[02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:36.120]  smaller than what's going on in China and China is very concerning because it
[02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:41.160]  has a lot of parallels to 1929 not only are people buying things on margin and
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:45.760]  now as the economy as the stock market crashes they get these margin calls and
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:49.360]  causes this cascading effect we saw the same thing happen at the beginning of
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:54.320]  the Great Depression it is 13 times the size the Greek economy it is the
[02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:58.560]  ascending economy just as United States was the ascending economy as the Great
[02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:03.680]  Depression began Great Britain was the largest economy but the US was taking
[02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:08.840]  its place similarly we have the ascending economy China which is about to
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:12.240]  become the largest I think by many measures that already has become the
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:17.960]  largest just as it's starting to come up and take its place as the ascending
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:23.240]  economy where the engine of growth is that economy then collapses out of a
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:27.360]  frenetic stock market that's operating largely on margin so there's a lot of
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:31.000]  parallels there and it's a gigantic economy but you can see what's going on
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:37.600]  in Greece in terms of the political machinations of these international
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:41.800]  multinational corporations and the efforts to create a world government and
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:46.600]  I think that's one of the aspects of this that's very interesting as well as the
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:52.240]  insights that we get into the vital role of currency and how important it is for
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:57.280]  countries to control their own currency and not relinquish that control to some
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:04.040]  privately controlled central bank that's the root of the causes of Greece's
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:08.440]  problems right now of course this is a competition that's been playing out this
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:14.920]  last week between the Germans and the Greeks as was pointed out and this is in
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:20.840]  the can't I don't see which newspaper this nevertheless Greece news live
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.840]  Greeks and Germans in a rift with the rest of Europe actually it was Germans
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:29.000]  in a rift with the rest of Europe and now it looks like Brussels this is a
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:34.600]  article from yesterday it looks like Brussels has now put pressure on the
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:41.840]  Germans to bow to the demands of Greece to extend these new terms on these loans
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:46.240]  these are not necessarily good terms they're raising the retirement age to
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:50.640]  67 you keep hearing about how they've got these lavish pension funds they're
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:53.640]  retiring early well maybe that was the case it's not going to be the case now
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:58.120]  67 that's far longer than anybody else in Europe and of course they're going to
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:04.000]  cut their pensions by over 40% but we see the press in a full court trying to
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.800]  in a full court press trying to to show them as being irresponsible things like
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:13.680]  this from the telegraph the Greek government's monthly sale salary and
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:19.320]  pensions bill is roughly the equivalent of buying 548 Bugatti Verans every month
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:25.320]  of course that's a super car that sells for one or two million dollars you know
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:28.720]  what it isn't the pensioners that are getting Bugatti Verans they're not
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:32.440]  getting 548 Bugatti Verans and of course they're not saying that but that's a
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:37.720]  very subtle psychological insinuation that they're living above their means
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:42.400]  they put that picture there oh you know this the super car this luxury car
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:47.000]  buying 548 of these multi-million dollar cars every month know the people who
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.480]  can afford that are the Goldman Sachs bankers who engineered this financial
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:57.880]  crisis they're going to have a lot of austerity they've already cut 25% of
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:03.120]  their economy with these previous austerity programs they have a 25%
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:09.400]  unemployment rate amongst youth it's 50% they are suffering from a depression and
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:14.760]  this is how you get depression you dry up the supply of cash you cause deflation
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:20.000]  just as I was talking about before the break and I think the finance minister
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.760]  who just resigned this last week and I think he understands that and he kind of
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:28.920]  laid out for people who didn't really understand the roots of depression and
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:34.600]  deflation he kind of laid that out for them and in his plan you could see just
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:39.120]  how desperate the Greek government was to have some control over their economy
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:44.320]  as he was pointing out all the peripheral economies Portugal Italy
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:50.040]  Greece Spain Ireland what they call the pigs say again you know these are guys
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:54.920]  who buy 548 Bugatti Verons each month okay they call them the pigs they're
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:58.840]  the peripheral economies there and they're not pigs they're people who made
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:05.200]  the mistake of joining a union that was created by a bunch of central bankers
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:09.480]  and multinational corporations and they're having their monetary supplies
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:13.640]  manipulated they can't get any money to fund their economies one of the things
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:16.800]  he came up with he says well maybe so that we could kind of escape the
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:21.120]  constraints of the euro without having to go back to the drachma their original
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:25.680]  currency maybe what we could do is we could create a cryptocurrency we could
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:30.480]  call it future tax coin and we could do things like sell it you know buy a
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:35.160]  thousand euros worth of this and then two years you turn it in for $1500 worth
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:41.000]  of tax credits so in other words it increases 50% in value it's used to
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  offset taxes by the Greek government and of course it's something that people
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.480]  would be able to freely sell just as you can buy bonds and you can sell them
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:52.280]  before they mature it'd be something that would be increasing but he would
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:57.000]  have to come up with this kind of convoluted scheme only because the IMF
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:02.280]  and the European Central Bank and the German bankers are starving them of cash
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:06.280]  that's why the ATMs are running out of cash so they don't have a currency that
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.960]  they can run to. Bitcoin is going huge in Greece it's going huge all over the
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:16.680]  world actually they say the customer base has increased with nearly 120,000
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:21.080]  transactions occurring each day in early June an increase of 10 times over the
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:27.240]  same period in 2011 they say last week Coinbase a Bitcoin exchange and wallet
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:32.400]  provider waived fees for customers buying with euros due to the Greek crisis
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:37.120]  now of course the headline from Business Insider says Bitcoin is faltering at a
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.040]  bad bad time they're having trouble processing there's so many people are
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:45.320]  buying Bitcoin having trouble running through all the processing okay
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:49.440]  processing all the orders everything well it still has a collapse like the
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:54.440]  New York Stock Exchange or the Wall Street Journal or United Airlines okay
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:40:00.400]  so it's not doing as bad as they did but it's still interesting that demand is
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:05.520]  up several hundred percent with Bitcoin it's interesting on Twitter Max
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:10.680]  Kaiser had tweeted out just before they enacted the capital controls he put a
[02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:15.640]  picture of a thumbnail and he said this and Bitcoin is the only way you're
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:20.680]  going to save your money if you live in Greece and he was maybe he's being proven
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:24.440]  correct I think it's also interesting and looking at the hardship of the people
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:31.240]  there they can't get even the most basic medicine they can't get insulin for the
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:37.000]  people who are diabetic do you see anything being done by doctors without
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.360]  borders I googled it I couldn't see anything you know the only thing I
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:44.600]  found when I looked for doctors without borders in Greece they're not bringing in
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:49.200]  any medicine for those people forget about them okay they go places where
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:53.560]  there's Ebola and then they bring it back into into our country whatever they
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:57.760]  were complaining because they said illegal immigrants who had gone into
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:01.360]  Greece were suffering and not being able to get medical care and treatment
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:04.000]  everything but the Greek people they could care less about them they're not
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.920]  going to put insulin in there for them they're not going to do anything to help
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:13.360]  them this is the crackdown of crony capitalism of the central bankers and I
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:18.960]  want to cover Eric Holder because nothing exemplifies better this kind of
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:23.200]  corruption and cooperation that we have between the big banks and government
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:27.320]  then the story of Eric Holder and this is from Rolling Stones it's from Matt
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:31.160]  Tiavi and this guy is a great investigative journalist he's done a
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:37.720]  lot of stories on the Libor scandal on HSBC and UBS being involved in money
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:42.640]  laundering for terrorist groups this is his story Eric Holder Wall Street
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:46.680]  double agent comes in from the cold he points out that Holder who just resigned
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:50.120]  we resigned a long time ago then he kind of hung around I don't know how many
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:54.400]  months six to nine months afterwards said Holder will re-assume his
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:57.880]  lucrative partnership he made two and a half million dollars the last year he
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:02.400]  worked there and he will take his seat in an office that reportedly and he says
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.880]  this is no joke was kept empty for him in his absence so he was working for this
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:15.200]  this corporation that was Covington and Burling which represented big banks and
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:19.840]  they even left his office vacant for him because they knew he was going to be
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:23.960]  coming back after he continued his work for the same clients I'm going to break
[02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:27.680]  that down for you here he says though this is the way he portrayed it so he
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:32.600]  said I'm just I'm going to go back to making millions every year because I am
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:36.680]  so interested in doing charity work to benefit the public this is what Eric
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:40.600]  Holder said just because I'm at Covington doesn't mean I'll abandon the
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:44.960]  public interest work the firm's emphasis on pro bono work and being engaged in
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:49.240]  the civic life of this country is consistent with my world view that
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:53.600]  lawyers need to be socially active and so Matt Tabi says you're right he's
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:57.400]  going back to Covington in Burling because of the firm's emphasis on pro
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:01.800]  bono work here's a man who spent six years handing out soft touch settlements
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:07.600]  to practically every too big to fail bank in the world he says collectively the
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:12.040]  decisions that he made while in office saved these firms and he lists them he
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:16.880]  says these are firms that they represented okay firms like Morgan Stanley
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:21.600]  Wells Fargo Chase Bank of America City Group just to name a few he points out
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:28.160]  okay those former clients of his and now they are his clients again and I would
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:31.560]  say and it's I think Matt Tabi would say they were his clients while he was
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:36.760]  Attorney General as well he said he saved them a sum that is impossible to
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:40.760]  calculate he says Holder doesn't look like it but he's actually a revolutionary
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:45.320]  he institutionalized a radical dualistic approach to criminal justice
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:49.720]  essentially creating a system of indulgences where in the world's richest
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:54.160]  companies paid cash for their sins and escaped the sterner punishments the law
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:58.840]  dictated and he says here's the five things that Holder did number one he
[02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:03.480]  failed to get a single conviction in court for any of the crimes related to
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:07.360]  the financial crisis remember back 2008 you know it all happened was going down
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:10.880]  they got elected on that they were going to reform everything they didn't do any
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:15.440]  of that nobody went to jail about any of that number two he says Holder
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:20.520]  famously invented a concept called collateral consequences under which the
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:24.160]  state could pursue non-criminal alternatives for companies if they
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:28.360]  believe prosecuting them might result in too much collateral damage there's an
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:34.200]  example Britain's HSBC which admitted to massive money laundering and violation
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:38.640]  Swiss Bank UBS which manipulated the LIBOR interest rates remember LIBOR is a
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:43.480]  London inner bank exchange rate okay that's how they if you've got a variable
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:47.480]  rate mortgage that's how it's what it's tied to as a LIBOR rate so matter of
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:51.000]  fact if you don't have a variable rate mortgage if you got a fixed mortgage they
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.800]  come up with that fixed mortgage rate based on the LIBOR exchange they were
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:01.040]  making money by playing the the the the difference in that it was all exposed it
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:04.200]  was something straight out of the movie the sting remember where they had the
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:09.040]  the horse races and they were delaying the information for the guy they knew
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:12.080]  who was going to win but they were delaying the information they were
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:14.960]  placing their bets and making money on it and then playing the people for
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:20.080]  suckers that's essentially what this was what was being done in London he says
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:23.280]  both banks so even though they were let go even though nobody went to jail they
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:28.480]  got fines okay they got fines they were too big to jail and Eric Holder said
[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:31.440]  that along with Lenny Brewer and of course Lenny Brewer also worked at this
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:36.280]  same firm they were caught up doing the same thing later on okay they didn't
[02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:39.480]  learn their lesson why because they weren't punished he says it's worth
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:43.600]  noting that Holder before he became Attorney General represented UBS at
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:47.360]  Covington and Burling so again another one of the banks that he represented they
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:51.040]  say that his lenient policies were deployed at a time when fellow officials
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:55.680]  like Geithner and Ben Bernanke were using bailout money to merge trouble firms
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:00.360]  together to make even larger firms see they were too big to fail but that
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:04.200]  didn't stop them from making even bigger companies his argument was we can't
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:09.240]  punish these guys because they're so big they'll have a negative effect on the
[02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:12.640]  entire economy we can't take it shut down HSBC they're just too big
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:16.760]  nevertheless they're making them bigger and bigger and you know this all
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:20.080]  started back in the Clinton administration I remember when it started
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:24.960]  because I was in North Carolina and it was Nations Bank being merged with Bank
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:31.760]  of America and it was someone who was tied to Nations Bank what's his name
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:36.480]  Erskine Bowles okay was in the Clinton administration everybody said this is a
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:40.320]  merger that is too big it's gonna set off massive consolidation if they allow
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:42.840]  this to go through everybody said they're not going to allow the Justice
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:46.520]  Department won't allow this well the Clinton administration did because they
[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:51.200]  had a guy Erskine Bowles who was involved had been involved with one of
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:54.840]  these banks so they approved the merger and guess what that set off the
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:59.760]  consolidations that resulted in just a few banks about seven that were too big
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:04.040]  to fail they started doing whatever they wish they removed the restrictions on
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:07.880]  them getting involved in speculative margin calls they created all these
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:12.040]  derivatives they pumped up the mortgage market and then when everything went
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.800]  boom they all got off when of course Eric Holder was a part of this let's go
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:18.800]  back to the Matt Tiabi article from Rolling Stones he says number three
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:25.200]  Holder also pioneered the extra judicial settlement extra judicial settlement
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:29.200]  striking huge deals with companies in which judges didn't sign off on the
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:33.760]  agreement see this is kind of like the exact opposite of the mandatory minimums
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:37.720]  where you've got some guy that's got the pot that he's growing in his in his
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:43.680]  closet and they're gonna nail him for 10 or 20 years and there's nothing that
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:46.800]  the judge can do about it no violence involved no prior convictions he's
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:50.600]  gonna go to jail based on the quantity you know mandatory minimums no they
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:54.360]  got just the opposite for the big guys they get extra judicial settlements
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:59.640]  okay in other words leniency they say that this institutionalized the backroom
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:04.640]  deal everything was done in secret our secret government number four he said
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.280]  there's a huge misconception that is pushed by people on Wall Street that
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:13.000]  quote they were let off because no one broke any laws and actually that's what
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:17.320]  Obama said Obama said some of the most damaging behavior on Wall Street in
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:22.160]  some cases the least ethical behavior on Wall Street wasn't illegal and Matt
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.640]  Tiabi points out yeah Obama is a great lawyer and he knows how to twist the
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:32.440]  words he says some of the worst behavior wasn't illegal is true but much of it
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:36.920]  was listen to what they let these guys off with okay he says some of this was
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:41.560]  very illegal they got guilty pleas from these guys for crimes like fraud
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:48.760]  manipulation bribery money laundering tax evasion and this is a description of
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:55.640]  HSB's crimes from Eric Holder's Justice Department quote as a result of HSBC
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:02.200]  Bank's USA AML failures at least $881 million in drug trafficking proceeds
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:06.480]  including the proceeds of drug trafficking by the Sinaloa cartel in
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:12.200]  Mexico were laundered through HSBC Bank USA that's what Eric Holder's Justice
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:18.920]  Department said $881 million in drug trafficking money laundered by HSBC and
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:23.400]  he says you might remember this is Matt Tiabi saying you might remember the
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:31.960]  Sinaloa cartel had ISIS style torture videos but HSBC laundered
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:38.680]  their cash they even created listen to this they even created HSBC created a
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:44.400]  special teller window to make sure that the Sinaloa cartels deposits were made
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:49.040]  easier you have that they got their own special teller window the people who were
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:54.960]  making ISIS like torture videos this drug cartel they were laundering their
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:59.960]  money and had a special teller window for them this is he said admitted it is
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:05.480]  not alleged this is not a conspiracy theory okay this is criminal activity of
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:12.400]  the highest order that Eric Holder let go for his former now current clients
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:15.840]  okay and I would argue they were his clients all along says but Holder went
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:20.720]  out of his way to let them keep their US Charter he gave their executives a
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:27.000]  grand total of zero days in jail zero dollars in individual fines and then
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:32.880]  listened to and any points that this is HSBC laundering money for guys who chop
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:37.120]  people's heads off with chainsaws and then the last thing that they did was
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:42.880]  they gave they called these fines remedial payments and that allowed them
[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:48.000]  to write them off as tax deductions so even though they claim they get a seven
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:52.800]  billion dollar fine a chase they get two hundred and forty five billion dollars
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:57.600]  of it as a tax write-off isn't it great to have friends in high places this is
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:01.960]  what's going on in our corrupt government so what was the promise of
[02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:05.440]  Obamacare but for many the government mandate caused more problems than it
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:08.760]  solved and I want to tell you about a truly affordable alternative Liberty

[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:49.440]  a Texas County feel that Obama had led a US military invasion no that was not
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:55.440]  what we said that is a straw man argument and we're very concerned about a lot of
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:58.840]  things that are happening in the course as we talked about the increased
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:02.560]  militarization of our police the increased presence of SWAT teams how
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:06.440]  differently our government treats its citizens than most of the developed
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:10.840]  world I mean we're being treated like citizens of Banana Republic so it
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:19.440]  concerns us very much when we see massive exercises training in cities because
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:23.480]  you train where you're going to fight and then we see this coming up just a
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:27.120]  few days after that after the Washington Post tells us on July 4th oh don't
[02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:30.600]  worry the Americans are coming the Americans are coming no then they tell
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:38.720]  us they're going to not allow press coverage at jade helm 15 okay embedded
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:42.000]  reporters will not be permitted at any point during the exercise says
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:46.000]  Lieutenant Colonel Mark LaStore he was the guy that was at Bastrop as we've
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:50.760]  documented before it there was inconsistencies in his story even on the
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:55.320]  same day in terms of what he was saying clearly he's not being straight with
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:58.960]  people and you just can't get a straight answer from our government
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:04.240]  especially from the military if you remember it was last summer that there
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:08.360]  was a drudge report article and they were talking about how they could not
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:11.600]  control the press the things were getting out in the drudge report and so
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:15.440]  forth and so on and some one of the people at the press conference one of
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:20.920]  the younger military officers there stood up and said nobody believes what
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:24.680]  we're telling them anymore they just think it's mindless propaganda because
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:29.200]  it is she confronted the guy from the Pentagon and told him that and we we
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:32.680]  showed that on on videotape at the time but they're saying embedded reporters
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:35.920]  will not be permitted at any point during the exercise then they kind of back
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:40.000]  pedal and say well we'll consider that nothing is finalized but we're not
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:44.240]  really going to do that because of course this is special forces but then
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:48.320]  Washington Post points out however the military has granted access to special
[02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:53.400]  forces in the past they say one recent example they had a journalist as part of
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:56.640]  the Robin Sage exercise in North Carolina that's an exercise has been
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:01.280]  going on for a very long time but it is very different than this exercise it
[02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:05.840]  doesn't go on for two months it doesn't involve every member of special forces
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:10.120]  they say this embedded journalism covering embedded journalists covering
[02:58:10.120 --> 02:58:15.840]  Robin Sage in North Carolina wrote a profile for the magazine okay this is
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:21.640]  not going to happen here this is about mastering the human domain and if you've
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:25.640]  not seen our report you need to look at that you need to understand this is
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:29.640]  about geospatial intelligence it's about coordinating the military using
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:32.840]  them as boots on the ground for the surveillance state for the police for
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:38.240]  the NSA that's what this is about we'll be watching this this next week we want
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:42.960]  you to send us your reports when you see something film something and tell us
[02:58:42.960 --> 02:59:06.680]  about it visit GCN live comm today
