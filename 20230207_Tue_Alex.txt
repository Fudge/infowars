[00:00.000 --> 00:28.520]  The most banned network in the world China is testing China is manipulating China is
[00:28.520 --> 00:33.240]  seeing how far they can go with these probes and we put it together with their
[00:33.240 --> 00:37.280]  Confucian societies and six billion dollars a year in the US universities
[00:37.280 --> 00:41.560]  the control academia and biopoliticians you look at their acquisition of the
[00:41.560 --> 00:45.160]  media and the fact that they own four of the six big production houses in
[00:45.160 --> 00:49.760]  Hollywood lacking farmland China has struggled to secure food for its 1.4
[00:49.760 --> 00:54.040]  billion citizens just recently in August for Chinese government departments
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.960]  warned a drought posed a severe threat to the autumn harvest that has driven
[00:58.960 --> 01:03.160]  overseas investments in food including the purchase of Virginia based pork
[01:03.160 --> 01:08.120]  producer Smithfield Foods and partnership with Gromark a grain logistics firm this
[01:08.120 --> 01:14.160]  entire system we see is being foisted by a handful of corporations and the
[01:14.160 --> 01:18.240]  Chinese Communist the people that run our country are out to get us there at
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.560]  war with us on every front and you already know that but as soon as we can
[01:22.560 --> 01:27.360]  get the bureaucrats and and and the the woke left us to just pull back and
[01:27.360 --> 01:31.600]  understand that they've been Stockholm syndromeed and that they're helping
[01:31.600 --> 01:35.480]  their own abusers and destroyers and they're pretending like they're part of
[01:35.480 --> 01:40.320]  some liberal revolution to create a utopia as soon as they realize that
[01:40.320 --> 01:43.760]  this liberal utopia is meant to bring in total autocratic tyranny and then
[01:43.760 --> 01:48.160]  they're gonna have a backlash and ban the entire leftist system that they've
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.760]  injected into us to only paralyze us in the next phase of the new world order
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.160]  program ladies and gentlemen it's gonna be eugenics all the way and but they
[01:56.160 --> 02:01.720]  intend on making the world so hellish in the build-up to 2030 that everybody'll
[02:01.720 --> 02:06.880]  just wink wink when they release the ray specific bio weapons starting with
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.080]  Africa that are gonna wipe that continent absolutely out the facts are
[02:12.080 --> 02:17.280]  China has put a lot of money into high-healtitude balloons for what you
[02:17.280 --> 02:21.760]  call satellite arrays surveillance arrays but more importantly communication
[02:21.760 --> 02:27.280]  systems but they've also put a lot of money in to deliver a electromagnetic
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.680]  pulse weapon that's detonated and powered by an atomic or hydrogen bomb going
[02:32.680 --> 02:38.920]  off it's estimated that a 40 megaton bomb that's a medium-sized bomb would
[02:38.920 --> 02:43.080]  knock out large portions of the United States it was detonated around 80,000
[02:43.080 --> 02:49.120]  feet in the right conditions but there's more radiation that goes further at
[02:49.120 --> 02:54.440]  night because of radiation that's already in the atmosphere from the Sun and so
[02:54.440 --> 02:57.960]  they would try to detonate these at night they would have a much bigger effect
[02:57.960 --> 03:01.640]  you've seen what solar flares do wreaking havoc with satellites that's
[03:01.640 --> 03:07.200]  nothing compared to this and the fact that Biden didn't order this shot down
[03:07.200 --> 03:13.640]  day one the fact that the Communist Chinese confirmed it was theirs just
[03:13.640 --> 03:17.120]  shows you what the board patrol said they're not watching the border they're
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.160]  not watching anything except us order the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.040]  as soon as possible they decided that the best time to do that was as it got
[03:26.040 --> 03:31.360]  over water outside within our within 12 mile limit and then you have Hunter
[03:31.360 --> 03:35.280]  Biden with the laptop and saying he works for Chinese intelligence and all the
[03:35.280 --> 03:38.160]  classified documents at the house he was running for 50 grand a month from his
[03:38.160 --> 03:45.800]  dad you're all just absolutely pieces of proof that the Bidens are Chinese
[03:45.800 --> 03:52.400]  Communist agents $100,000 a month as a retainer for Hunter Biden to work for a
[03:52.400 --> 03:58.560]  Chinese entity with ties to the Chinese Communist Party $500,000 right off the
[03:58.560 --> 04:06.480]  top as a one-time payment to Hunter and $65,000 a month for James Biden the
[04:06.480 --> 04:11.840]  president's brother but we're talking about something that goes beyond simply
[04:11.840 --> 04:16.280]  an appearance we're talking about the question of what could Hunter Biden
[04:16.280 --> 04:20.480]  possibly bring to the table for this Chinese company to pay him these
[04:20.480 --> 04:24.880]  astronomical sums of money and this has gone now beyond sort of the partisan
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.120]  witch hunt I don't think that that Democrats can make that claim anymore
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.200]  the fact this has been going on is important yes the globalist set up
[04:33.200 --> 04:37.000]  China but by the time G.G. Ping came along and now he's arrested his
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.240]  predecessor that was working with the globalist G.G. Ping is told big tech of
[04:41.240 --> 04:46.440]  the New World Order I'm in charge and I'm not to deal with you anymore and so
[04:46.440 --> 04:50.040]  just like Stalin and Hitler for the first two years of World War two had a
[04:50.040 --> 04:58.080]  deal and then Hitler broke it it's the same story again
[04:59.880 --> 05:04.800]  the good news is the real red pill plus after over two years being sold out
[05:04.800 --> 05:07.960]  because the key ingredients are not available the supply chain right now

[06:00.560 --> 06:17.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[06:17.400 --> 06:25.000]  Are you feeling it yet? Has the realization been made?
[06:25.000 --> 06:34.520]  Has it sank in on your consciousness the situation that we are currently in
[06:34.520 --> 06:43.880]  right now as Americans or even as humans on planet Earth for most in this
[06:43.880 --> 06:47.200]  audience you probably have been aware of this for a while you've probably already
[06:47.200 --> 06:54.120]  done plenty of prepping emergency food whatever situation you've got financially
[06:54.120 --> 07:02.480]  girding yourself for a collapse but before I get to any of the news and we
[07:02.480 --> 07:06.720]  are going to open phone lines today as well
[07:09.760 --> 07:15.560]  folks we're taking things pretty seriously around here we're making a lot
[07:15.560 --> 07:25.040]  of emergency procedures and a lot of emergency decisions I would say just for
[07:25.040 --> 07:28.560]  myself personally because I wouldn't I wouldn't give you any advice I'm not
[07:28.560 --> 07:34.560]  giving myself or taking myself for me personally you know I've already done
[07:34.560 --> 07:39.600]  preparedness stuff you know bug out bad emergency food supplies other such
[07:39.600 --> 07:45.240]  stuff but something is really hitting home with me this week and I'm basically
[07:45.240 --> 07:51.920]  going full bore preparation for total collapse right now I mean I'm closing
[07:51.920 --> 07:55.680]  bank accounts I'm getting other stuff right I'm getting other stuff lined up
[07:55.680 --> 08:01.920]  because at this point the odds of things totally collapsing under Joe Biden are
[08:01.920 --> 08:07.880]  higher than they've ever been the odds of a World War three situation impacting
[08:07.880 --> 08:14.960]  us more so than any other World War the odds of that are at an all-time high and
[08:14.960 --> 08:24.440]  just aside from those circumstances coming to the front we have psychotic
[08:24.440 --> 08:32.360]  mad villain leaders running our country and you know that might be the case for
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.400]  other countries around the world but nothing like what our leadership has done
[08:37.400 --> 08:43.040]  the disdain they have for humanity the disdain they have for their fellow
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.280]  Americans the disdain they have for us specifically the Patriots and you can see
[08:48.280 --> 08:54.040]  it in their eyes you can see it in their cold soulless gaze you can see it in
[08:54.040 --> 09:00.760]  their policy you can see it in their execution of their will to crush you
[09:00.760 --> 09:04.880]  instead of actually trying to help this country or have good policy on the world
[09:04.880 --> 09:11.920]  stage so I don't want to spend too much time on the emergency notice I don't want
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.000]  to spend too much time sounding the alarm because I do want to take calls I
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.920]  want to cover the news but at this point it would be it wouldn't be fully
[09:23.920 --> 09:31.120]  transparent to lead the show with where we're at right now where our minds are
[09:31.120 --> 09:37.520]  at where our hearts are at and you know I talked to some of the crew here in
[09:37.520 --> 09:42.840]  studio off-air and we're all kind of feeling the same thing and and this is
[09:42.840 --> 09:49.400]  I mean this is info wars like we live we live in the storm we are the sauce we've
[09:49.400 --> 09:53.040]  climbed over the barbed wire we've bled out we've had our bodies climbed over by
[09:53.040 --> 09:55.920]  the rest of the media picking up our stories afterwards after we hit the
[09:55.920 --> 10:00.720]  barbed wire and bled out on it first and so for us to kind of have this moment
[10:00.720 --> 10:06.320]  and it's almost calming in a way and kind of a sick twisted way it's almost
[10:06.320 --> 10:10.200]  calming like knowing all of this was coming and now feeling like you're
[10:10.200 --> 10:15.960]  finally here to deal with it all it's almost calming in a way but when you
[10:15.960 --> 10:21.680]  see what could potentially lie ahead you realize for those that aren't prepared
[10:21.680 --> 10:27.440]  and for those that that really are about to be caught off guard by this it is I
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.120]  mean folks we just had people last week climbing into dumpsters looking for food
[10:32.120 --> 10:36.520]  here in Austin Texas and and we're not talking about you know sad situations of
[10:36.520 --> 10:39.560]  homelessness or people that are downtrodden or down on their luck or
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.120]  whatever in this tough economy we're talking about the average Joe we're
[10:44.120 --> 10:46.800]  talking about the average homeowner we're talking about the average apartment
[10:46.800 --> 10:53.200]  runner dumpster diving for food and this is because they're without power for
[10:53.200 --> 10:58.240]  three days if China drops an EMP or Russia drops an EMP you're out of
[10:58.240 --> 11:03.160]  power for months you think this US government's gonna come rescue you hell
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.240]  the US government wants to turn off your power it's called green new green new
[11:07.240 --> 11:13.840]  deal it's called carbon neutral emissions what does that translate to no
[11:13.840 --> 11:20.160]  power for you man-made climate change stop man-made climate change take
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.040]  climate change out of the equation and you'll understand the picture stop man
[11:25.040 --> 11:31.560]  so I don't know if it's the eye of the storm moment or I don't know if it's
[11:31.560 --> 11:40.240]  the the time has finally come moment but and and maybe this is what I'll open up
[11:40.240 --> 11:43.880]  the phone lines on today and and just to see if you agree and I want to be clear
[11:43.880 --> 11:48.200]  on this too I'm not I'm not a pessimistic person I actually have hope for
[11:48.200 --> 11:53.080]  America I have hope for humanity and I think on the other side of whatever
[11:53.080 --> 11:59.240]  darkness that is about to befall us here we will come out better we will come out
[11:59.240 --> 12:03.480]  more prosperous we will come out with a better understanding and appreciation of
[12:03.480 --> 12:08.000]  freedom and and the whole thing might even be unifying something we haven't
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.640]  seen in a long time but this this time period we're about to go through here
[12:15.640 --> 12:20.160]  with World War three on the brink with our mad psychotic leaders I mean folks
[12:20.160 --> 12:33.240]  you understand nuclear bombs have been dropped before and I don't want to hear
[12:33.240 --> 12:37.000]  this thing cuz I hear people tell me oh well there's no such thing as nukes when
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.680]  you know what whether you believe in nuclear bombs or not are you denying
[12:40.680 --> 12:47.440]  that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were completely devastated by a bomb do you
[12:47.440 --> 12:54.000]  want to get into the semantics of it all you can't deny that and so this stuff
[12:54.000 --> 13:05.560]  happens and you say why such a loss of life why such a devastational weapon
[13:05.560 --> 13:09.360]  well what was the excuse the excuse was that the Japanese leadership had gone
[13:09.360 --> 13:15.440]  psychotic and that if they weren't killed and taken out of power then more
[13:15.440 --> 13:21.680]  people would have died and and that death would expand it across the globe
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.920]  you understand that it's our leaders now that are the psychos you understand
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.960]  it's our leaders now that are gonna cause death and famine worldwide and that's
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.800]  what's so frustrating about all of this because I think at a certain level the
[13:36.800 --> 13:44.360]  Chinese the Russians so many other world leaders are trying to wake this
[13:44.360 --> 13:47.800]  country up and they're just saying what is wrong with the American people why
[13:47.800 --> 13:53.240]  are they so blind why are they so deaf why are they so dumb and we know who it
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.200]  is we know what it is do I really have to say it
[13:58.840 --> 14:02.720]  they're in Stockholm syndrome they're completely under brainwashing and I
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.120]  guess they just really don't get the implications of what they're involved in
[14:08.120 --> 14:11.440]  they really don't understand the implications of what it is they're
[14:11.440 --> 14:21.160]  buying into what it is they're trying to sell you so I'm gonna come back we'll
[14:21.160 --> 14:28.320]  pile drive through a lot of this news but I think the big story today is with
[14:28.320 --> 14:35.040]  all the stuff we see spy balloons flying around explosions in the sky crash
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.440]  landing in Montana the government says they don't know what's going on hundred
[14:38.440 --> 14:44.240]  oil tankers derail in Ohio massive fire towns evacuated you just had a massive
[14:44.240 --> 14:48.720]  earthquake in Turkey which is truly devastating people thinking it's not
[14:48.720 --> 14:52.760]  an earthquake and maybe something else I'm not necessarily gonna go down that
[14:52.760 --> 14:58.920]  road but the devastation in Turkey is real parts of Syria as well we just had
[14:58.920 --> 15:05.040]  a another gigantic structure fire in Chicago that just happened last night
[15:05.040 --> 15:16.880]  we've got a wide open border a wide open border a wide open border so I mean it's
[15:16.880 --> 15:22.800]  just the signs are all around you the signs are everywhere it couldn't be more
[15:22.800 --> 15:32.000]  obvious and so if you're not if you're not making some moves right now if
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  you're not getting into a proper stance right now to prepare for the worst
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.720]  then you're just you're just not really tuned in and you're not really
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.040]  understanding what's going on and most in this audience already are you've

[20:02.520 --> 20:27.480]  assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[20:27.480 --> 20:36.320]  I look around at some of the trends let's say happening on other alternative
[20:36.320 --> 20:42.160]  media sources and personalities and it's extremely clownish considering the
[20:42.160 --> 20:48.880]  situation we're in but then again info wars was always the one that understood
[20:48.880 --> 20:56.160]  the situation info wars was always the one to tune into to cover news without
[20:56.160 --> 21:05.640]  the infighting and without the drama and without the irrelevance trying to be
[21:05.640 --> 21:10.440]  made relevant and you know I just got to say I'm so proud of this audience and
[21:10.440 --> 21:16.560]  I'm so proud of this crew and just I can't even explain the honor to be here
[21:16.560 --> 21:23.720]  at the pinnacle at the pinnacle of news and information and live broadcast and
[21:23.720 --> 21:28.720]  transmission and of course it would be the most attack of course it would be
[21:28.720 --> 21:35.000]  the number one target the enemy of the New World Order of the deep state and so
[21:35.000 --> 21:42.440]  it's just it's it's hard to even fathom quite frankly what we're what we're
[21:42.440 --> 21:46.840]  going through right now and to see what other people are getting dramatic about
[21:46.840 --> 21:52.680]  and talking about it's just clownish and it but it but but that's another point
[21:52.680 --> 21:57.400]  why do I put that meme on the screen of the dog in the house that's on fire
[21:57.400 --> 22:03.400]  drinking the coffee because that's what it's like right now I don't think this
[22:03.400 --> 22:12.360]  image on the screen has ever been more real I mean I just look around at
[22:12.360 --> 22:16.720]  everything going on and it's like the house is on fire the house is on fire
[22:16.720 --> 22:21.600]  why are you sitting at the dinner table drinking a cup of coffee reading a
[22:21.600 --> 22:27.080]  newspaper the house is on fire are you gonna put it out you're gonna get out
[22:27.080 --> 22:32.040]  look around you do you see the flames they're touching you do you see the
[22:32.040 --> 22:38.840]  smoke you're inhaling it not everything's okay but see here comes Joe Biden
[22:38.840 --> 22:43.680]  tonight for the State of the Union and he's gonna be telling you how great it
[22:43.680 --> 22:48.800]  is he's gonna be telling you it's the greatest economy ever greatest economy
[22:48.800 --> 22:58.880]  ever now anybody that lives in reality knows that's a complete lie this is the
[22:58.880 --> 23:05.720]  worst economic situation most people have been in in years I mean quite
[23:05.720 --> 23:13.280]  frankly since the Obama collapse but but but aside from that we can we can name
[23:13.280 --> 23:18.600]  names or dates or whatever the reality is most Americans are feeling the
[23:18.600 --> 23:22.200]  pinch right now most Americans are feeling the pressure right now the
[23:22.200 --> 23:27.120]  dollar doesn't go as far grocery prices going up energy bills going up and Joe
[23:27.120 --> 23:29.560]  Biden's about to get on the stage tonight and tell you it's the greatest
[23:29.560 --> 23:34.240]  economy ever you're doing better than you ever have forget about that wide
[23:34.240 --> 23:38.480]  open southern border forget about that Chinese spy balloon forget about war
[23:38.480 --> 23:49.840]  with Russia so I think I think the realization that is so devastating to
[23:49.840 --> 23:57.560]  me now is we had so many opportunities as Americans to come together and realize
[23:57.560 --> 24:03.200]  that our leadership has become psychotic mad villains and in many ways
[24:03.200 --> 24:07.240]  electing Donald Trump was that realization and trying to go a different
[24:07.240 --> 24:12.360]  direction and so the Empire struck back and installed Joe Biden and now it's
[24:12.360 --> 24:20.560]  worse than ever and that's where we're at but I feel that the window of time for
[24:20.560 --> 24:24.800]  the awakening and the unifying of all Americans is just past and at this point
[24:24.800 --> 24:30.160]  if you still support Joe Biden if you still think the Democrat Party is the
[24:30.160 --> 24:35.680]  good guy and your friend then you're just gone you're just lost you're basically
[24:35.680 --> 24:44.320]  like you know the dog at the end of what is it lassie it's like we you know we
[24:44.320 --> 24:47.800]  don't want to take you out to the back in the barn and say goodbye but
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.760]  politically culturally as far as the pro-human movement is concerned you're
[24:52.760 --> 25:00.160]  you're not gonna make it you're not gonna make it and that's sad even though
[25:00.160 --> 25:06.960]  you hate us so much even though you've celebrated our censorship and and rooted
[25:06.960 --> 25:12.040]  for our demise and physically attacked me and assaulted me and everything else
[25:12.040 --> 25:17.020]  no it's still it still hurts that you're supposed to be on my team it still
[25:17.020 --> 25:20.280]  hurts that you're supposed to be my fellow American my fellow human and
[25:20.280 --> 25:24.520]  instead you'd rather stab me in the back and nip it my heels as the country is
[25:24.520 --> 25:28.000]  burning down around us and we're both in this ship together going down and
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.280]  you're too busy focused on destroying me or or I use me as an example America
[25:34.280 --> 25:40.480]  you know Christianity common sense you're so you're so filled with hatred
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.520]  for Donald Trump or capitalism or whatever boogie man has been put in
[25:44.520 --> 25:49.680]  front of you that the ship that you're floating upon is going down and you
[25:49.680 --> 25:56.720]  don't even notice but see I'm just waxing here so Joe Biden doesn't want to
[25:56.720 --> 26:00.400]  protect the southern border but he does want to protect the Capitol tonight
[26:00.400 --> 26:05.360]  they've they put up massive fences walls for me not for the fence goes up at
[26:05.360 --> 26:09.720]  Capitol ahead of Biden State of the Union address now why are they putting a
[26:09.720 --> 26:14.360]  giant wall up because these are criminals folks now there's no threat at
[26:14.360 --> 26:20.040]  the Capitol most most Americans you know most godfearing patriotic Americans
[26:20.040 --> 26:26.000]  they don't want to go anywhere near DC DC is a cesspit of corruption and a
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.000]  hive of villainry they don't want to go anywhere near DC there's no protest
[26:32.000 --> 26:38.240]  scheduled for DC this is a sign of how corrupt and criminal the Biden
[26:38.240 --> 26:43.160]  administration is why do mob bosses walk around and bulletproof cars with with
[26:43.160 --> 26:48.080]  gigantic security teams because they're criminals because they're mob bosses
[26:48.080 --> 26:54.000]  that's Joe Biden why does Joe Biden need a 12-foot fence why does Joe Biden have
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.520]  to secure the Capitol perimeter ahead of his State of the Union because he's a
[26:57.520 --> 27:06.720]  criminal because he's a crook because he's a mob boss and he's going to tell
[27:06.720 --> 27:13.080]  you how great the economy is tonight he puts out a tweet this morning the
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.400]  record-breaking Biden economy record-breaking folks you're in the
[27:17.400 --> 27:22.600]  greatest economy ever I mean what an unbelievable lie who could even believe
[27:22.600 --> 27:27.040]  this tell me who's who's who's living in the greatest economy ever right now I
[27:27.040 --> 27:31.520]  can I work for you where are you living where are you where are you making your

[27:48.800 --> 27:55.320]  Biden claims it's all record-breaking economy from Joe Biden I mean I could
[27:55.320 --> 27:59.200]  put up the phone lines right now I don't want to have the the the the communist
[27:59.200 --> 28:05.720]  struggle session of us lamenting over whatever financial situation we're in
[28:05.720 --> 28:11.280]  since Joe Biden has taken over but I could we could do entire shows and we
[28:11.280 --> 28:15.640]  could take nothing but callers talking about how bad it's been how hard the
[28:15.640 --> 28:21.040]  economy has hit them since Biden took over doesn't matter Biden says record
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.080]  breaking economy and now he's gonna have the thief president of Brazil the

[28:38.480 --> 28:44.320]  communists meeting in the White House as a display of dominance over you as a
[28:44.320 --> 28:50.240]  display of corruption conquering you but you know there's one factor though
[28:50.240 --> 28:53.760]  there's one factor and that's the American people which is still a

[31:58.840 --> 32:06.000]  in the year 2000 Alex Jones's film dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove showed
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.760]  the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in
[32:11.760 --> 32:20.480]  private. In 2007 Alex Jones releases end game exposing the world elites plans for
[32:20.480 --> 32:26.040]  covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind and by the time
[32:26.040 --> 32:32.120]  they launched their attack in 2020 Alex Jones's info wars and our audience were
[32:32.120 --> 32:37.360]  there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming. This

[33:19.800 --> 33:26.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[33:26.200 --> 33:33.200]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[33:33.200 --> 33:39.160]  and now your host Owen Troyer. Alright I've caught myself waxing here and I
[33:39.160 --> 33:42.840]  just can't help my mind when I when I start thinking about the situation we're
[33:42.840 --> 33:46.240]  in and I start looking at the world developments around me but I'm gonna
[33:46.240 --> 33:51.680]  catch myself here I'm gonna stop it and I'm gonna come and right now start
[33:51.680 --> 33:55.600]  hitting these headlines two things I'm gonna do first one I'm gonna get out the
[33:55.600 --> 33:58.800]  phone number because I want to hear your thoughts on all this you heard my
[33:58.800 --> 34:03.680]  little extended opening monologue if you will and so it's it's a bit of an open
[34:03.680 --> 34:08.560]  minded conversation but just generally speaking what are you thinking what are
[34:08.560 --> 34:13.600]  you feeling right now are you are you hopeful for the future are you pessimistic
[34:13.600 --> 34:16.720]  do you think we're really about to go through something serious the likes of
[34:16.720 --> 34:20.480]  which we've never seen before what do you think is the biggest story is it the
[34:20.480 --> 34:26.960]  war building in Ukraine is it the Biden crime family corruption getting covered
[34:26.960 --> 34:30.160]  up what really happened with that balloon that floated over the entire
[34:30.160 --> 34:33.200]  country I mean these are all things we're not getting any answers from our
[34:33.200 --> 34:37.600]  leadership Joe Biden just has greatest economy ever border wide open the
[34:37.600 --> 34:43.840]  borders under control so I mean you got no leadership here you got nothing from
[34:43.840 --> 34:48.600]  Joe Biden he's a corrupt crooked criminal and anybody that is still
[34:48.600 --> 34:54.560]  supporting this guy and propping him up is is now guilty by association and so
[34:54.560 --> 34:59.280]  again I just I lay it out like this you got to understand history folks why did
[34:59.280 --> 35:06.640]  we bomb Japan why did we nuke Nagasaki and Hiroshima what is it what is it
[35:06.640 --> 35:09.680]  written in the history books what is it taught that their leaders were
[35:09.680 --> 35:14.280]  psychotic and if they weren't killed more death would have come to the planet
[35:14.280 --> 35:22.640]  well what do you think we're looking at with people like Joe Biden so that's
[35:22.640 --> 35:27.360]  kind of my take on all of this but let's hear from you the audience and this is
[35:27.360 --> 35:31.880]  why the audience is so valuable in these crucial moments as a sounding board as a
[35:31.880 --> 35:37.720]  communication forum to hear what you're thinking and what you're feeling 877
[35:37.720 --> 35:43.880]  789 2539 877 789 2539 and quite frankly I feel like if I didn't
[35:43.880 --> 35:48.440]  tap into the human intelligence that was this audience then then I would be a
[35:48.440 --> 35:54.800]  fool so we're gonna fill up these boards we're gonna try to take a lot of calls
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.040]  today I'm gonna eventually also just pile drive through these news headlines
[35:58.040 --> 36:05.680]  as well that's part of the program but 877 789 2539 just everything that's
[36:05.680 --> 36:10.080]  going on the oil tankers blowing up the huge structure fires in Chicago the
[36:10.080 --> 36:14.200]  gigantic earthquake in Turkey I mean look around you folks we're in the burning
[36:14.200 --> 36:19.160]  house right now what are you doing to try to escape the burning house or where
[36:19.160 --> 36:22.440]  are you trying to find refuge in the burning house in case it collapses on
[36:22.440 --> 36:30.160]  us now let's not take info wars for granted in these trying times and in
[36:30.160 --> 36:36.120]  fact it's more imperative now than ever and we'll be in the future that trend is
[36:36.120 --> 36:40.440]  not trending the opposite way it's continuing to trend that info wars and
[36:40.440 --> 36:44.520]  our live transmissions are more important now than ever and it's not just the

[39:09.040 --> 39:16.800]  gonna go to all the calls that we have here now the situation is Zelensky is a
[39:16.800 --> 39:23.040]  little tyrant he's a little Nazi running Ukraine and pretty much all of the
[39:23.040 --> 39:26.880]  eastern countries know that he's cut deals with the corrupt western
[39:26.880 --> 39:32.640]  politicians like Joe Biden and they want him out and even Europe and the EU and I
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.440]  think NATO to an extent are hesitant to back Zelensky because he's such a corrupt
[39:37.440 --> 39:44.480]  crook with ties to Joe Biden whose time in the barrel is coming Biden's been
[39:44.480 --> 39:48.560]  caught folks people have turned on Joe Biden everybody knows he's going down
[39:48.560 --> 39:55.800]  it's just a matter of when not if so even NATO that's been aggressive towards
[39:55.800 --> 40:03.920]  Russia here and even the EU that may have its own problems with Putin they
[40:03.920 --> 40:11.560]  don't even want to commit to this war with Zelensky and Biden the two main
[40:11.560 --> 40:15.480]  faces and voices leading it these are two of the biggest criminals in the
[40:15.480 --> 40:24.240]  world these are two of the most corrupt sick of fans that you've ever seen so
[40:24.240 --> 40:28.240]  even the EU and NATO that is hot under the collar for a war with Russia or
[40:28.240 --> 40:35.440]  regime change in Russia even there as as excited as they might be for a war with
[40:35.440 --> 40:40.200]  Russia regime change in Russia they're like boy but we got to go to we got to
[40:40.200 --> 40:45.640]  go with Zelensky we got to go with Biden they're like oh and it's all the
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.040]  American media telling you how great he is it's all the American media telling
[40:49.040 --> 40:53.200]  you how great Biden is and I just feel bad for the American liberal that falls
[40:53.200 --> 40:57.740]  for all this I genuinely do at this point you're being led like sheep to the
[40:57.740 --> 41:05.920]  slaughter if you haven't realized this yet the entire world has realized this
[41:05.920 --> 41:13.840]  now it's only the American liberal that doesn't get it yet it's it's it's quite
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.120]  a sight to be seen quite frankly with all the access you have the information
[41:19.120 --> 41:25.000]  and history and you still can't see how you're being deceived by this crook in
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  Ukraine by this crook in the White House who's gonna lie to you tonight and
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.760]  tell you it's the greatest economy you've ever lived in while you're digging
[41:33.760 --> 41:37.600]  through the dumpsters looking for food because you lost power for a couple days
[41:37.600 --> 41:40.880]  because the Democrats in Austin don't know how to prepare for a winter storm
[41:40.880 --> 41:46.840]  three straight years Poland ready to take part in creating new world order
[41:46.840 --> 41:53.280]  against Russia says Polish PM Mora Weki look Poland is the only country in
[41:53.280 --> 41:58.440]  Europe that seems to be gung-ho for this war against Russia and Poland has its
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.480]  own beef with Russia and they're hyper nationalist and maybe they really are
[42:02.480 --> 42:07.800]  afraid of Putin coming in but it's pretty much Poland the only country in
[42:07.800 --> 42:13.600]  Europe that is banging the gongs of war and then it's of course Joe Biden who's
[42:13.600 --> 42:16.920]  protecting his own criminal enterprises and the criminal enterprise of the
[42:16.920 --> 42:23.000]  Western interest in Ukraine now the question would be this because I ponder
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.720]  this what is Russia's next move everybody knows Russia's getting ready to make a
[42:27.720 --> 42:33.480]  big move and at first and I'm not convinced this might not be the long-term
[42:33.480 --> 42:38.080]  goal for Vladimir Putin I thought okay well Russia's next move which is
[42:38.080 --> 42:41.360]  inevitable now is going to be to move in and just removes Alinsky from power
[42:41.360 --> 42:45.280]  whatever that means now he may he may scuttle off into Europe and that could
[42:45.280 --> 42:48.440]  become different but I think at this point what Russia wants to do is go in
[42:48.440 --> 42:53.880]  and shut down the Biden bio labs I think that's Russia's next move is to go into
[42:53.880 --> 42:57.640]  Ukraine and shut down the Biden bio weapons labs and so that's going to be
[42:57.640 --> 42:59.920]  ugly
[43:00.920 --> 43:05.560]  I talk a lot about the great successes in full wars this had I don't think anybody
[43:05.560 --> 43:11.040]  can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when
[43:11.040 --> 43:14.320]  we talk about the crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers
[43:14.320 --> 43:20.720]  the writers they really have been the MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison
[43:20.720 --> 43:24.880]  Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day five six
[43:24.880 --> 43:29.600]  seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole

[47:15.520 --> 47:23.920]  I don't want to set the world man I just I just can't say enough about this
[47:23.920 --> 47:31.120]  crew I can't say enough about this audience and we're about to go to the
[47:31.120 --> 47:35.400]  phone lines but again folks I think it's important for us to understand this and
[47:35.400 --> 47:44.440]  I tend to get lost in the sauce too but let's just the two questions that demand
[47:44.440 --> 47:47.560]  answers that we're just not gonna get from our government from our media
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.040]  because they're corrupt their liars or their morons quite frankly in many cases
[47:52.040 --> 47:59.200]  and that's what is the real story with the Chinese spy balloon and why is Russia
[47:59.200 --> 48:04.480]  about to launch an offensive in Ukraine now I've still got more questions and
[48:04.480 --> 48:09.920]  answers when it comes to the spy balloon situation but I think in the in the
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.000]  situation in Ukraine I think we got a pretty good idea of what the next big
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.520]  moves for the Russian military are and I think I think the final stage if
[48:19.520 --> 48:24.360]  Zelensky doesn't resign is is to get Zelensky out he's corrupt he's the bad
[48:24.360 --> 48:29.400]  guy and and folks again your media is lying to you your politicians are
[48:29.400 --> 48:34.280]  lying to you Zelensky is not well liked in Ukraine Zelensky is hated in Ukraine
[48:34.280 --> 48:40.800]  they hate this Nazi bastard they hate this fascist scum who's getting hundreds
[48:40.800 --> 48:46.520]  of thousands of Ukrainians murdered the Ukrainian army is devastated ladies and
[48:46.520 --> 48:49.440]  gentlemen do you understand that everything you've been told to about this
[48:49.440 --> 48:53.920]  war is a lie the Ukrainians have lost a quarter of a million people the
[48:53.920 --> 49:00.560]  Ukrainians their army is done folks it's over the war is over Russia could walk
[49:00.560 --> 49:06.000]  right through Ukraine right now and there would be no resistance Putin is
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.000]  begging the world to wake up Putin is begging the West to wake up Putin has
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.480]  offered an entire year's worth of time for Zelensky to resign he won't do
[49:16.480 --> 49:23.520]  it why because he's working for the CIA and because he's in in a client of the
[49:23.520 --> 49:30.240]  Biden crime family so he won't step down Putin has given him a year to do so he
[49:30.240 --> 49:38.360]  refuses Putin has taken the Eastern front strategically speaking Crimea freed
[49:38.360 --> 49:43.440]  those people and now Zelensky in the Ukrainian army has been bombing them
[49:43.440 --> 49:49.280]  killing Ukrainian civilians no Zelensky is not the hero no Zelensky is not well
[49:49.280 --> 49:53.920]  liked in Ukraine he's the bad guy everybody knows it you're being lied
[49:53.920 --> 49:59.480]  to so Russia is gonna move in their next move is to shut down the biden
[49:59.480 --> 50:03.720]  bio weapons labs now there's two stories developing in Ukraine right now
[50:03.720 --> 50:06.760]  that you're not hearing one I just told you how the entire Ukrainian army is
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.680]  devastated the only chance Ukraine has at any fight now is if is if American
[50:11.680 --> 50:15.520]  troops or other Western troops have boots on the ground that's the only
[50:15.520 --> 50:22.880]  chance Ukraine has is a full-on war with Western troops in Ukraine is that
[50:22.880 --> 50:29.680]  what you want is that what you want American fighting for Zelensky the
[50:29.680 --> 50:35.280]  Ukrainian army is devastated folks to Russia for two weeks has been reporting
[50:35.280 --> 50:41.360]  chemical warfare on the front lines hitting their troops where do you think
[50:41.360 --> 50:46.680]  that's coming from it's coming from the Biden bio labs ladies and gentlemen
[50:46.680 --> 50:52.760]  run by Hunter Biden with funding from Chinese communists and Joe Biden's
[50:52.760 --> 50:57.320]  corrupt business dealings so Russia's move now that the Ukrainian army is
[50:57.320 --> 51:04.200]  devastated and they've got probably half a million troops fully fed and rested
[51:04.200 --> 51:09.600]  and ready to go armed to the teeth and they're about to move in and shut down
[51:09.600 --> 51:15.280]  all of these Biden bio weapons labs and then they're gonna show the world the
[51:15.280 --> 51:18.800]  American media will hide it from you the US government will hide it from you and
[51:18.800 --> 51:23.120]  they're gonna go and they're gonna shut down the bind bio weapon labs the shut
[51:23.120 --> 51:26.960]  down the bind bio labs and they're gonna show the world what the Bidens have been
[51:26.960 --> 51:32.960]  up to and what the US has been up to making biological materials probably for
[51:32.960 --> 51:37.280]  military purposes and it's already been used against the Russians might
[51:37.280 --> 51:42.240]  actually have been the origin of COVID-19 now we're all convinced it came
[51:42.240 --> 51:46.720]  from Wuhan maybe not so fast actually maybe it actually came from Ukraine in
[51:46.720 --> 51:50.880]  one of the Biden bio labs so that's Russia's next move I don't know when
[51:50.880 --> 51:54.600]  they're gonna do it it's gonna be any day now and they're gonna fully march right
[51:54.600 --> 51:58.000]  through Ukraine and they're gonna shut down the 46 bio labs or whatever it was
[51:58.000 --> 52:03.080]  and by the way Victoria Newland has now admitted that those labs exist first
[52:03.080 --> 52:06.800]  they denied it then we saw the deep dive into the research where they had it all
[52:06.800 --> 52:09.360]  laid out it was all in the government websites and everything it was all in
[52:09.360 --> 52:13.600]  the Biden manifesto so now Victoria Newland says oh well they're just doing
[52:13.600 --> 52:19.560]  research those are just research facilities bullcrap what was really
[52:19.560 --> 52:24.440]  going on in the Biden bio facilities and is Russia about to go shut them all
[52:24.440 --> 52:30.640]  down that's what I think is coming next ladies and gentlemen now without further
[52:30.640 --> 52:35.880]  ado let's go to the phone lines now just just the state of everything what
[52:35.880 --> 52:39.380]  you're thinking what you're doing how you're feeling about things we got great
[52:39.380 --> 52:44.880]  callers on the line we start with Jaylene in Michigan I'm just gonna go top
[52:44.880 --> 52:50.120]  to bottom on this list guys Jaylene in Michigan you're on the air go ahead hey
[52:50.120 --> 52:53.160]  good afternoon Owen good afternoon thanks for calling
[52:53.160 --> 52:58.160]  been a listener for about 15 years I've kind of got a side note thinking about
[52:58.160 --> 53:02.760]  the vaccine injuries I don't know that's part of it I mean that can't be
[53:02.760 --> 53:06.840]  forgotten let's not forget that the the vaccines have killed at least 50,000
[53:06.840 --> 53:12.040]  Americans on record probably closer to 300,000 well I think the voice that's
[53:12.040 --> 53:16.360]  gonna get most recognized is the one that has the loudest and fastest voice
[53:16.360 --> 53:22.760]  ever it's when people in our trans community which I think is great not
[53:22.760 --> 53:27.760]  when they indoctrinate children but when they the trans community starts
[53:27.760 --> 53:33.200]  getting their myocarditis it's gonna make big news suddenly they're gonna
[53:33.200 --> 53:38.200]  have the loudest voice making this vaccine induced injury syndrome I'm
[53:38.200 --> 53:41.560]  just curious what makes you say this why do you think this is going to be a
[53:41.560 --> 53:52.200]  story just wait time was held because it's a common thing with the youth this
[53:52.200 --> 53:57.080]  is fancy this is culturally indoctrinated for them to think it's
[53:57.080 --> 54:01.960]  cool they can't identify with who they are themselves and they're searching for
[54:01.960 --> 54:09.000]  identity well I know that I know that famously flamboyantly gay soccer player
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.520]  Megan Rapinoe has just come out and claimed she got her fifth COVID booster
[54:12.520 --> 54:18.320]  which I can't even believe I don't know how anybody survives long after five of
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.520]  these things and so you know if she's promoting this to the gay or the trans
[54:22.520 --> 54:27.240]  community maybe then it'll be an issue well I just want everyone to recognize
[54:27.240 --> 54:32.600]  that they're they're risking their health their long-term future health with
[54:32.600 --> 54:38.920]  even one I personally have had COVID I've never taken the shot I'm wondering
[54:38.920 --> 54:43.680]  what I can do for my health just to make sure my blood stays pure yeah having
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.840]  had natural COVID and now there's more doctors coming out with with studies
[54:48.840 --> 54:53.360]  that look like it could be transmitted through sexual contact there's so many
[54:53.360 --> 54:57.960]  mysteries to this thing and the thing is you just got to avoid these vaccines at
[54:57.960 --> 55:04.440]  all costs and look I'm not because I think about this too you know I I like
[55:04.440 --> 55:08.560]  to play I like to play basketball I go play basketball a couple nights a week
[55:08.560 --> 55:12.480]  we run full court guys sweating running up and down the court you know I mean we
[55:12.480 --> 55:16.000]  make contact I know these guys have been vaccinated but you know I'm not gonna
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.360]  treat them like a leper and and avoid contact I'll be like Jesus I'll hang
[55:20.360 --> 55:23.680]  out with the lepers is a crude comparison maybe but I mean yeah this is
[55:23.680 --> 55:26.920]  stuff we got to think about whether it's a trans community whether it's kids
[55:26.920 --> 55:30.280]  whether it's everyday Americans these vaccine injuries are not going away I
[55:30.280 --> 55:33.280]  got a whole stack of them right here actually that I haven't even gotten into
[55:33.280 --> 55:39.600]  but absolutely that's a big issue Jaylene that another bouncing ball to
[55:39.600 --> 55:43.600]  follow the depopulation agenda with the vaccines and that's why Bill Gates comes
[55:43.600 --> 55:47.620]  out and says Elon Musk needs to stop being pro-humanity and he needs to fund
[55:47.620 --> 55:52.480]  vaccines read in between the lines folks all right let's go to Ken in Illinois
[55:52.480 --> 55:58.240]  Ken you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead hey good morning there and welcome
[55:58.240 --> 56:03.360]  to the land of confusion I'm looking forward to hearing what you guys have
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.160]  to say I'm not gonna watch the state of illusions night I was thinking at first
[56:07.160 --> 56:14.640]  to be nice to see the the 20 resistors walk in with birthday balloons or
[56:14.640 --> 56:20.960]  something that's so funny you said that and actually it was mentioned somebody
[56:20.960 --> 56:24.800]  suggested on Jesse Waters prime time last night I was actually live last
[56:24.800 --> 56:29.080]  night doing Owen Schroyer live I said the same thing I said there's two there's
[56:29.080 --> 56:32.240]  two ways Republicans should handle this either every single one of them should
[56:32.240 --> 56:36.560]  walk in with a balloon a white balloon and it have to probably be on a stick
[56:36.560 --> 56:41.080]  because or I don't know how they would do it because there's no helium so they're
[56:41.080 --> 56:45.400]  not gonna float and they and the they probably wouldn't let them the Biden
[56:45.400 --> 56:48.360]  administration will probably make sure that hey if you see a balloon don't let
[56:48.360 --> 56:51.360]  them walk in but you can sneak a little balloon in your pocket nobody would
[56:51.360 --> 56:54.840]  notice it and you get in there and then you blow it up and maybe just hold it up
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.160]  or put it on a stick or something and I think every single Republican should do
[56:58.160 --> 57:01.840]  that or it might even be better optics if just one did it because that it looks
[57:01.840 --> 57:06.080]  like the spy balloon so maybe Lauren Bovert I think would be a good individual
[57:06.080 --> 57:11.920]  to do that she needs a little boost after a contested heated election and plus
[57:11.920 --> 57:14.800]  she's the kind of person that would like to do a stunt like that so I mean they
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.480]  do their stunts all day long the Kooten Kente scarf with the knee no I think a
[57:18.480 --> 57:23.560]  Republican should come in tonight with a big white balloon absolutely okay cuz
[57:23.560 --> 57:27.800]  I was wondering it sounds good at first but then I was thinking well they'll
[57:27.800 --> 57:31.320]  turn it around but how they turn everything around anyway no see and
[57:31.320 --> 57:34.120]  that's exactly the approach and I know you're not saying that they should take
[57:34.120 --> 57:37.640]  it you're just speaking to reality that's the approach that the Republicans
[57:37.640 --> 57:40.760]  need to change oh I'm afraid how they're gonna twist it oh I'm afraid they're
[57:40.760 --> 57:43.800]  gonna call me a racist or I'm afraid they're gonna quit being afraid of these
[57:43.800 --> 57:48.240]  commies shove it in their face
[57:49.760 --> 57:54.640]  the good news is the real red pill plus after over two years being sold out
[57:54.640 --> 57:57.680]  because the key ingredients are unavailable the supply chain right

[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:37.720]  the land of confusion that's why info wars need to be on air try to clear the
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:52.000]  air try to clear the smoke of some of that confusion not enough love to go around
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.080]  all right we're taking your calls let's before we get into a deep fill Collins
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:02.840]  dive here go back to the phone lines now we did have a call to bring up the the
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.160]  vaccine issue I'll hit some of those headlines but let's go back to the lines
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.160]  right now we've got Bobby in New York Bobby you're on the Alex Jones show go
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.440]  ahead yeah what's up everybody I just want to tell everybody look up alphabet
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:22.240]  loon it's a project that they they launched out of Puerto Rico and everyone
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.600]  looked us up in 2019 and I believe that it correlates with the shots the harvest
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.720]  the biometric tracking everything they do because faces BS is to face the watch
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.280]  all bodies to watch our movement they shot everybody with a radioactive substance to
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.440]  harness your biometric tracking movement to watch everybody on earth all right
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.800]  so they launched all these balloons out there these balloons are launched by our
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.640]  own government all the governments all the governments are working together you
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.960]  had three guys from Africa stand up against this BS COVID lie died they got
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.680]  killed they got murdered with these balloons we got it on the screen here
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.000]  these are obviously a lot smaller than the alleged Chinese balloon are these
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.280]  ones filled with helium too or what's the story the story is that it doesn't
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.120]  matter what they're filled with the heart they're in correlation with those
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.240]  poison dead shots that Donald Trump rolled out so so so the the the theory
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.240]  being the shot puts the tracking device in your body so it's permanent not like
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.400]  a cell phone that you can turn off or put in a ferrity closure or just ditch
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:28.480]  and these things can just monitor all human tracking all activity that is
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.440]  precisely what they do right from the devil's mouth and you know himself the
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.880]  people we're the only saviour for ourselves we have to incorporate we're
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.840]  fighting mega corporations we have to form our own corporation of truth
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.960]  transparency and freedom the people no politician allowed in and these guys
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.280]  Anthony Fauci and Donald Trump have to be code defendants for crimes against
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.760]  humanity and war crimes enough of it you're promoting a guy who rolled out
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.400]  genocide
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:06.240]  all right well there it is from Bobby in New York and of course though I mean the
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.920]  helium story I think is the the one thing that people might be curious about
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:16.440]  why is there a global shortage on helium well how many of these building-sized
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:22.800]  balloons are floating around tracking us tracing us spying on us how much how
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.440]  much helium does it take to fill a building-sized balloon the one that you
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.040]  see on the screen here this thing is tiny compared to the Chinese spy balloon
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.720]  the Chinese spy balloons at least four times that I mean these are massive
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:42.120]  massive balloons pieces of equipment here the satellite itself when they talk
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:48.840]  about oh three buses the satellite itself was three buses just the satellite
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.720]  was three buses and why did they have to blow it up and why did they want to
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.160]  sink it into the saltwater ocean did they not want you to see what was really
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.200]  in that balloon or on that satellite whatever it was what are they really
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.600]  hiding what is the real story what about all the other ones that have been
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.760]  spotted across the planet with no answers only mysteries what about the one in
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.080]  Costa Rica what about the one in Japan mm-hmm your media didn't tell you about
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:19.080]  that but no I think them I think the link here is the helium shortage and it's
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:23.680]  amazing how nobody's making this connection you have a gigantic building
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:29.120]  sized balloon filled with helium you know NASA apparently uses more helium
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:33.560]  than any other enterprise out there on the planet so maybe that was a NASA
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:38.960]  balloon maybe it wasn't even a Chinese balloon oh we shot it down over the ocean
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.920]  to be safe really well when it was going over the Pacific Ocean and you were
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.560]  tracking it which you claim you were now why didn't you shoot it down then we're
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.200]  being lied to we're being lied to about these balloons bring lied to about
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.520]  everything people are finally starting to get it you're about to be lied to
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:03.200]  tonight by Joe Biden for about 60 minutes I talk a lot about the great
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.640]  successes info wars this had I don't think anybody can deny it and it is
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.920]  because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.600]  crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.680]  really have been the MVPs this fight and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:27.000]  Troyer and the hard work they engage in every day five six seven days a week it's
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.960]  really just incredible so for myself the whole info wars crew I thank you for
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.920]  your past support I only encourage you now to realize that info wars can not
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.500]  stay on air if you do not support us I know you spread the word I know you
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.480]  pray for us that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.480]  go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.640]  your life all at the same time give us on air I know that less than 1% of
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:55.800]  our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com if just 1% more of
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:59.160]  you took action at went to infowarstore.com our funding problems will be over
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.240]  please take action now
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:11.520]  and now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation it's
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:35.080]  Owen Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show by the way we're just
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.720]  discussing here in the break about our coverage for the state of the union
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.800]  tonight we will have some coverage whether it's in studio or not I'm not
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.280]  sure but we'll have some coverage and we'll post that stay tuned at info
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:56.440]  wars.com to find that I mean people say oh and you're on air more than ever
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:02.000]  before it will up yeah do you see what's going on I mean kind of the thing to do
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.800]  is you know people want to be informed and sadly most people in media aren't
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.200]  going to tell you what's going on they don't even know what's going on so no I
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:17.160]  work at info wars you see we're the true leaders in the media so yeah we have a
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:24.440]  bit of a duty we have a bit of a promise to our audience and so we're gonna we're
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.080]  gonna be offering coverage of that not not sure exactly how that's going to
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.160]  look or be but stay tuned at info wars.com for that coverage if I have to
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.200]  do triple duty tonight we'll do it crew will do it too they did it last night
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.360]  they do it every day quickly though with some vaccine stories and by the way
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.640]  this is not all of it because when I do double duty like this I already had most
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.560]  of my show planned out for the war room with a whole another stack of vaccine
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.080]  injuries that I just don't have on my stack today here on the Jones show but
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.800]  we'll cover it later fallout Michigan lawmakers demand accountability for
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.120]  Pfizer gain-of-function fascist partnership with feds and
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:01.440]  lamestream media after Project Veritas report yeah we shouldn't let that die
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.240]  we shouldn't let that go away a Pfizer executive talking about how they do
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:13.280]  gain-of-function research and his words a giant scandal the vaccine would be a
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:20.840]  giant scandal because of the fertility issues in women and the heart problems in
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.480]  men kind of a big deal they told you to take this vaccine it killed your mother
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.880]  they told you to take this vaccine it killed your son they told you to take
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.880]  this vaccine safe and effective now you had a stroke you have a neurological
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.800]  disorder you have seizures and they all knew it and all in the response to a
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:43.760]  virus made in a lab but folks let's not get distracted I agree I understand we're
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:49.040]  all pretty we're all in agreement that it came from a Wuhan lab maybe not so
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.480]  fast maybe it's even worse maybe it came from a Biden bio lab in Ukraine and
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.280]  maybe they did make it and release it just so they could have these vaccines
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:06.680]  in response maybe it is that diabolical maybe it wasn't China I move on Thailand
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:14.600]  to ban Pfizer after princess falls into a coma following booster jab hmm you won't
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:21.120]  hear about that in your television news must watch disease expert sues Japanese
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:26.520]  government for covering up COVID vaccine dangers and in Japan they actually kill
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.640]  about they actually care about their citizens getting killed not our
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.600]  government they think it's a good thing when Americans get killed they're
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:37.880]  eugenics but in Japan they actually care when their citizens are getting
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.880]  wounded by these big pharmaceutical products so they're probably gonna have
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.360]  some rubber meeting the road there and of course California has dropped the
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:52.880]  COVID vaccine mandate for kids so how many lives were saved with that if you
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.280]  scrap laid it out probably millions because you got to understand how the
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.960]  globalists and the eugenicists look at this folks if they can kill you with a
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:06.520]  vaccine that's fine but that's just not killing you they just killed your entire
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.640]  lineage they just killed your entire family tree they just killed all of your
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:22.000]  future ancestors or descendants rather that's how they look at it man just man
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.320]  this is our planet and Joe Biden is gonna get up there tonight and just lie to
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.800]  your face and tell you it's the greatest you've ever been the vaccines are great
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:36.440]  the economy is great and we're defeating Russia who still believes this
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.880]  crap only paid operatives and complete brainwashed fools let's go back to the
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:47.160]  lines we've got Chris in Texas Chris in Texas you're on the Alex Jones show go
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:55.360]  ahead what's up howdy hey you know I work I don't understand why people aren't
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:01.280]  as mad as your last caller was you know he was alright why aren't people like
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.280]  this well because they've been cocked Chris they've been cocked they've had
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.000]  their survival instincts beaten out of them they've been fluoridated into
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.160]  compliance their diet has removed the the chemicals in them that makes them a
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.120]  fierce animal I mean we have been domesticated all by design it's
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.800]  unbelievable I worked at a place with people who literally called themselves
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:32.760]  communists that's under young stupid kids you know yeah and instead of talking
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.640]  about a balloon is flying over our country that could possibly end our
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.720]  lives you know they're talking about what happened at the Grammy's they
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.600]  refused to hear logic all of them voted for Biden you know it's I just see you
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.920]  bring up the Grammys and this is how out of touch they all really are is they do
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.600]  whether Sam Smith is doing this for attention or to anger you or he really
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.040]  loves Satan whatever it doesn't matter the point is they're so obsessed with
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.720]  themselves they're so obsessed with their own little games that they're
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.560]  playing they don't see the house burning down around them and so either they
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.680]  either they like it and they're just in the death cult consciously or they're
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:20.200]  just so arrogant and they're so out of touch with humanity in reality that they
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.840]  play these little games they don't realize that they're going down yeah
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:31.520]  all of us they're taking us all down with unbelievable I couldn't be more
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.240]  obvious I mean it's a total Satanic ritual and it says brought to you by

[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.520]  end of the day China is not China is not the biggest direct threat to me it's
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.080]  the Democrat Party and it's the corrupt globalists that are stealing our future
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:07.080]  stealing our country yep I agree anything else Chris God bless you Owen

[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:39.040]  because it's so obvious that the evil and corruption is so widespread and

[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:12.600]  to leave them alone let them figure their own things out we wasted all our
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:18.840]  money over there you go to the U.S. debt clock you can see that our gold and
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:25.600]  silver is on zero with relation to the dollar that's scary what do you mean by
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.840]  that what expand explain on that a little bit that means that our dollar is
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.480]  worth zero with relation to okay we're not on the gold standard anymore yeah
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:42.520]  it's fiat well well if well yeah but it's off say tomorrow the FDIC comes in
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:47.440]  and we do the bail in we go into the zero now that's really that's really
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:53.280]  really scary especially if especially if the world starts doing you know gas
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.880]  deals without the petro dollar without the U.S. dollar then we're really in a
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:03.160]  world of hurt well what I'm concerned with is if we have everybody here at the
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:09.160]  Alex shoes to check out the flyover conservative show and check out the
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:14.840]  they will talk a whole lot about the the bail in we love the flyover
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.040]  conservatives they've got a channel at banned out video I've been a guest on
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:23.000]  their show multiple times yes we need to start paying a lot of attention to them
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.880]  they do a lot of very good content my concern is I have a guy that works for
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:37.800]  the DOD he has told me that our naval munitions we have less than 30 days to
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:45.680]  worth of munitions to take care of our naval as well as fuel for our ground
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.240]  military here in the United States well look let's just look at this practically
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:54.520]  Jeff the Biden administration has drained our strategic oil reserves many of
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:59.040]  which were sold to China and the Biden administration has drained much of our
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:06.080]  military reserves giving it to Ukraine yes two other failures yeah because how
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.600]  how can we protect ourselves at home when we have nothing here at home aside
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:16.120]  from well we our own people we are the biggest militia in the world luckily we
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.080]  are and that's why I said what I said earlier I said and this is not to be
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.880]  underestimated or underappreciated the biggest sleeping dot the biggest
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.720]  sleeping giant in this equation still is the American people and and they know
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.840]  that that's why the January 6 thing became their big false flag January 6
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.280]  was not what they claimed it to be it was a it was a gigantic peaceful rally
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.680]  that had some provocateurs and got a little bit out of control and and you
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.960]  know millions of Americans were there rightfully upset because our elections
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:51.280]  are being stolen from us but but they know the potential of what a million
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.440]  Americans or five million or ten million Americans actually waking up to try to
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:00.200]  take this country back they know what that actually represents as a threat to
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.600]  them we've never even been anywhere near that going on but January 6 would be
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.960]  maybe the closest thing even though that was a peaceful rally that got out of
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.880]  control with a bunch of provocateurs as you see on the screen clad in black
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:16.240]  probably not even Trump supporters either feds or Antifa but the biggest
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.640]  sleeping giant of in this equation is still the American people and I think
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.680]  the world is begging him to wake up I know the world doesn't want Joe Biden
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.600]  and Vladimir Zelensky blowing up the planet to protect their criminal
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:35.560]  enterprise no no no one wants to accept them two idiots and one thing that I
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.560]  agree with the lady they called earlier and it sounds crazy about the transgender
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.640]  people and things of that nature wanting to wake up my girlfriend is a
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.600]  traveling nurse and none of them have an idea until they start getting sick once
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:53.200]  they all start getting sick then they're gonna wake up well and I yeah and I feel
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.560]  like we're right on that brink man just from the people that I talked to and I
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.760]  know that the vaccine injury stuff is really starting to catch up and now
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.960]  that they're pushing this booster it kind of reef it kind of reef layers up
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.360]  that that thought that wound of the vaccine injury they had they're like
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.040]  you're gonna make me take another I just got over the sickness I had from the
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.880]  last one and you want me to take another so yeah this is another that that
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.880]  that story is not going away and hopefully I mean for God's sakes is there
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:25.720]  anybody in the Justice Department in law enforcement the FBI Congress like do
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:30.760]  you guys have a heartbeat you guys have a pulse hello are we just gonna forget
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.480]  what the Pfizer executive said on the tape last week we're just I mean we're
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.960]  just gonna continue to put these products out on the market we're gonna
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.640]  continue to put them into our kids arms what are we nuts well you see on
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:47.680]  social media the loudest people are the people that are in the trans community
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.760]  the people that are in the gay community nothing against them however if they
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:55.480]  are what they do want to be the loudest they do want to speak and that's fine I
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:01.000]  want them to speak out I want them to speak out and well this is why this is
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.760]  why we're gonna have gays against groomers founder on the war room later
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.640]  today Jamie Mitchell because here's what here's what she's understood she loves

[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.440]  these people don't even want to claim sexual identities but they see that this
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:27.320]  LGBTQ sexual identity is being used to get access to children and they're the
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:33.560]  entire movement is now weaponized and it's people like Sam Smith dressed in a
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.920]  satanic outfit that become the face of the LGBTQ movement and then the
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.320]  operational standard becomes get into the classroom and pervert the children
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:50.080]  and 99% of people that identify or happen to be LGBTQ plus whatever they're
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.480]  not into that they don't want Sam Smith to represent them they don't want to
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:58.640]  pervert the children these are just liberal communist Democrat Satanists

[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:34.760]  Troyer. I see some of our members of Congress starting to get it but the
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.320]  sense of urgency is still lacking they're still way behind on the sense of
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.640]  urgency but some are getting it that's why you see so many people leaving the
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:47.120]  Democratic Party like Kirsten Sinema who then immediately after she lives leaves
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:50.880]  all of a sudden as an ethics violation against her oh yeah that because that's
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.560]  how the crooked Democrats work oh you're not gonna play ball with us well we're
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:59.360]  gonna come after you and I may get into that new story later it's it's it's all
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.400]  BS it's just targeting Kirsten Sinema because she left the corrupt Democrats
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:11.680]  but Jim Jordan is telling it like it is and he just gave this address during a
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:17.760]  press conference and US politicians admitting how corrupt the US government
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:23.920]  is is the first step towards fixing the problem and it used to be liberals and
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:28.080]  leftists that that understood this now they just love the government corruption
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.600]  because they're empowered by it they use it to destroy their enemies and go
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.720]  after their opposition so they love big government fascism now but here's Jim
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:43.240]  Jordan warning the American people the trends he's saying we've had now dozens
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.640]  of whistleblowers come talk to House Republican staff on the judiciary
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.320]  committee in fact one of them is testifying in a transcribed interview
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.880]  as we speak talking about how the Justice Department is now operating in
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:00.800]  operating in such a political fashion and manner second you all know about the
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.920]  Twitter files where we have learned that big tech big government are colluding
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:09.960]  to keep information from we the people the most egregious example took place
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.720]  prior to the 2020 presidential election where they kept that information from
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.680]  the country just days and weeks before the most important election we have
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:22.760]  suppressing a story and limiting Americans free speech rights and then
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.760]  finally third when I think about the accountability that we plan to bring to
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.720]  this administration I just think in the broad sense I mean everything has gotten
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.720]  worse in two years time we went from a secure border to no border we went from
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:37.920]  safe streets to record crime we went from stable prices to record inflation and
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.080]  of course as I've said we have a government that now I believe is
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.880]  targeting the very people it is supposed to serve so we plan on as a
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.920]  Republican majority holding them accountable and dealing with what we
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.240]  have seen and again what has been exposed from the Twitter files and of
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:58.560]  course what these these brave FBI agents who've come to us now as whistleblowers
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.760]  and told us how the Justice Department is operating and how it is not supposed
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:06.640]  to be functioning in that manner because it is supposed to be equal treatment
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.800]  under the law in this great country now there's two important things to take
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.680]  away from that one the amount of whistleblowers that have communicated with
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:23.480]  members of Congress now sadly there's probably we'll call it spies or double
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.480]  agents maybe that are acting as Republicans but really just Democrats
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:32.280]  sharing intel with them so that's definitely going on so that the Biden
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.920]  crime family and the FBI knows who the whistleblowers are know exactly what
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.800]  they're saying and and they end up getting targeted and having their lives
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.640]  destroyed so it's a very it's a very tense situation kind of a cold war
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:50.840]  ask really inside the government right now with good Patriots in the FBI and
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.880]  other institutions coming forward as whistleblowers telling members of
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.000]  Congress but then there's certain people they're trusting that are going back to
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.880]  the deep state to the Bidens to the FBI saying hey here to the whistleblowers
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.400]  here are the people we need to get out here's what they're saying let's destroy
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:07.000]  their lives so that's definitely going on but the amount of whistleblowers that
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.640]  have come forward exposing the crimes at the FBI and exposing the crimes of the
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:17.800]  Biden crime family I would just say look you're you're playing a dangerous game
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:22.360]  playing this like a cloak-and-dagger situation you're playing a dangerous game
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.600]  doing all this behind the scenes and I'm not saying you're not doing the right
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:30.800]  thing you are but understand there's people that you think are your friends
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.360]  you think are your allies they're actually your enemies stabbing you in the
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.120]  back and reporting back to their bosses about what you're doing and that's why
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:42.440]  you're gonna have your lives destroyed you're gonna be under attack you're
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.840]  gonna lose your jobs and and and then there you're basically just gonna be
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:50.080]  knee-capped to the point where you can't even effectively be a whistleblower so
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.920]  really these whistleblowers need to go public you need to be going on Tucker
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.480]  Carlson you need to be going you need to be going on Info Wars but you
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.000]  probably are still too afraid to do that but fine you need to be going on
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.120]  Tucker Carlson you need to be going on all these other shows you need to be
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.800]  going public the American people all the are the allies that you can trust
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.800]  forget about the leftist liberals they're gone they're they're they're they're
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.200]  they're just gone they've lost their minds they've lost their souls they're
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.600]  gone the American people is your best bet at this point you need to be going
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.640]  public you need to be blowing the whistle on as many public platforms as
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:28.960]  possible because the deep state has their agents everywhere and you might be
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:32.280]  thinking you're talking to an ally a friend that might be a Republican and
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:37.880]  you might be wrong now what is the second takeaway that Jim Jordan says that we
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:43.280]  all understand here as well the US government has been aimed against us
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.680]  the federal government has been aimed against we the people I know this first
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.760]  hand from the political persecution that I've been dealing with now going on four
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:59.400]  years four years of legal political persecution that I can't shake never
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:04.280]  committed a crime never harmed a fly but because of who I am and where I work and
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:08.800]  what I do I've been dealing with four years of political persecution now so I
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:13.000]  get it but why do I say that why is that important to take away you know that
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.840]  folks we're dealing with a global crisis right now we're dealing with a
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.760]  destabilization and a in a push towards World War 3 and your government views
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:33.000]  you as the enemy how do you think that's going to go if you get into a larger
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:41.160]  escalation of war and your government views you as the enemy not a very good
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:46.920]  formula right there not a good equation right there let's go back to the phone

[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:30.680]  we're taking your calls here scattered with some of the news by the way there
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:37.320]  are some legitimate attacks against Ron DeSantis today and I don't like any of
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:40.680]  the attacking I wish that DeSantis we either just come out and say I'm not
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:45.200]  gonna run in 2024 or Trump would just quit attacking him I don't I don't like
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:52.960]  any of it but DeSantis hosting a lawyer today that was representing dominion
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:58.360]  lawsuits against Lindell and others is a little frightening and then the same
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.640]  people that brought you vaccine promotion and Hillary Clinton promotion
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.520]  posing as conservatives like Ben Shapiro yeah Ben Shapiro voted for Hillary
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:11.560]  Clinton and Ben Shapiro told you the vaccine was great and now he's coming
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:18.680]  out stumping for DeSantis E that's certainly not and I like DeSantis I
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:22.040]  think he's the best governor right now but these are things that make you make
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:27.080]  you go but you know one individual that you know has done some good things but
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:31.880]  there's legitimate questions about is Elon Musk and I just continue to see
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:36.840]  Elon Musk Elon Musk to me the approval rating just continues to go up and then
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.280]  he gets attacked by Bill Gates and if you pull up what Elon Musk has been up to
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:44.560]  on Twitter in the last 24 hours it's just I mean he's calling out the
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.480]  globalists he's calling out the fake news he's calling out the real threat to
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:53.960]  humanity Elon Musk identifies dangerous player in US government censorship and
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:59.600]  media manipulation agency called the GEC the global engagement center a little
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.840]  dropping of Barack Obama but Elon Musk is calling this out he says that
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:07.840]  censorship is the problem he says the world economic forum is a greater
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:11.600]  threat to world peace than the rest of these groups you hear about and he's
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:18.560]  just totally right so Elon Musk's approval rating in my book continues to
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:23.040]  go up and DeSantis who had a very high approval rating with some of the stuff
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.160]  we saw today may be slipping a little which is which is sad to see
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:35.200]  considering Trump is the godfather of operation warp speed and that issue and
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:41.760]  then DeSantis though cozying up to establishment types I mean we know that
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:45.840]  that's been a story but now it's like he could have gone the other way and now
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.400]  it's like well but that's neither here nor there because we're about to be lied
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:53.480]  to tonight by Joe Biden he's gonna tell you it's the greatest economy ever he's
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:58.040]  gonna tell you Ukraine is winning the war against rush up he's gonna tell you
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:02.200]  the border is secure he's just gonna lie through his teeth for an hour and it
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.640]  should be interesting to see if he can even make it you know that'll be the
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.000]  real issue is can he even make the speech how many times will he gaff how
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.080]  many times will he fumble how many times will he forget where he's at how
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:15.720]  obvious is gonna be he's hopped up on drugs or you can go with the outliers
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:19.520]  of this and is that even Joe Biden some people don't even believe it's Joe Biden
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:24.280]  I'm not going down that road but it's just it's gonna be insane tonight no
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.960]  doubt we'll have coverage at info wars.com so be on the lookout for that we
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:35.400]  go back to the phone lines great callers here Wayne in Texas Wayne you're on the
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:41.440]  air go ahead hey Owen so what I wanted to talk about is the three ways that the
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.840]  Prince of the power of the air deceives us and animates us you know in the forms
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:50.040]  of the beast the false prophet the antichrist the first way or the first
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:55.240]  heaven of the beast you know like those three pyramids you know in Giza you know
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:59.400]  where they honored the book of the dead you know beneath the earth but like their
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:04.440]  grain silos you know Joseph's greeneries but without the increase of God like he
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:09.440]  you know denies king because he didn't respect honors works the love of money
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:13.760]  and then you got three on earth which would be like the three temples in
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:19.520]  Jerusalem one waiting for the Obama abomination of desolation whereby the
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:24.360]  antichrist will come to take good to this house right and that's the love of
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:28.800]  get your own person honor and respect it like in the Old Testament where they
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.640]  tried to make themselves equal with God because they didn't believe in their
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:36.600]  hearts that God is a perfect creator they can create all many and so they
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:40.240]  tried to establish their own righteousness and then you've got like
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:45.200]  these three stars that make up Orion's belt you know and those are also called
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:50.000]  three kings or scales and balances and studying those three stars is very
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.160]  important as well so it's a first heaven second heaven and a third heaven for the
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:57.640]  beast the false prophet and the antichrist and those three in a trinity
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:03.000]  agree in one prince of the power of the air now Paul and Peter were going to
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.720]  deny Christ three times and Paul besought grace to remove that thorn in
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:11.760]  the flesh the mason vessenger state in the prince of the power of the air to
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:18.080]  take that from him by not loving his own word not loving having his own person
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:22.800]  honored and respected and not loving money and lifting up his hand like
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:27.400]  Abraham up to the most high and paying that are praying that that blindness be
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:33.200]  removed from him and and that he would go on and continue to increase his faith
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:39.320]  God's word animating to the breath of life and put all these Ponzi schemes
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:44.000]  to rest because these Ponzi schemes are a mountain made up of unknown ego day
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.960]  dying God you know and everyone's buying for power within that power stroke well
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:55.400]  look there's no doubt that the world economic form great reset you know
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:59.080]  global corporate government is dead on arrival and that's and that's part of
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:01.920]  their problem but that's part of what makes them dangerous in this moment too
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:06.440]  is because people are aware of what it means what it represents you know eat
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:10.640]  the bugs live in the pods you'll own nothing you'll be happy global eugenics
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:15.240]  it's not being accepted with open arms and this frustrates them this angers the
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:18.760]  system this angers the establishment so what are they gonna do take us to war
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:24.800]  collapse the economy how are they gonna get us to obey how are they gonna get us
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:29.400]  to comply how are they gonna get us back in order specifically these pesky
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:34.600]  Americans that refuse to give up their Bill of Rights and their First
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:39.740]  Amendment their Second Amendment and so on and so at least because of Info Wars
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:45.240]  and other people warning about this it is dead on arrival but now the the the
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:49.800]  grasp for for control of humanity into the future is more desperate Wayne
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:54.240]  thanks for the call let's go to Mike in Michigan Mike you're on the air go ahead
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:59.680]  oh and I'm honored that you're taking my call thank you thanks for calling um
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:08.120]  well um probably about six weeks ago my morning for the United States of America
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:18.120]  peaked and I went to my faith and I decided to give my Yoke a burden over to
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:26.560]  God as he asked we are not going to it's obvious here after six years we're not
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:34.320]  going to move both or shoot our way out of this chaos revival is the only way
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:41.880]  and I wanted to say I think that you know you're how you started off the show
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:49.640]  with your monologue totally I think all the listeners know that you Alex
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:56.200]  Harrison the crew all that you do you guys are out there we get to take a
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:03.800]  break you guys never get to take a break so I doubt that anybody thought that
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:09.560]  you're let's call it a rant was over the top by any means but you guys are
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:15.840]  doing is phenomenal work and I'm gonna challenge every caller that's been on
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:22.520]  and every call caller that's going to be on go to info wars make a donation
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:28.600]  that's the most efficient use of our money right now and that's it Owen I
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:33.680]  love you man you're doing you're all doing great but revival is the answer
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:38.480]  you know I really appreciate that Mike and I thank you for those words of
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:43.640]  support and encouragement and it's as valuable as gold to me and you know I
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.640]  don't complain I enjoy what I do fighting the globalist fighting for
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:52.320]  truth trying to build a better future it's it's a it's a labor of love to me
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:58.400]  despite you know the wounds and the and and the defeats even at times we take
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:06.480]  along the way but you know what you talk about why did we see such a flagrant
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:11.520]  display of Satanism at the Grammys on Sunday it's because I think what Mike is
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.920]  saying is is truly coming to fruition folks the Satanists know their time is
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:21.760]  short they know trans kids has a finite timeline they know that that all all the
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:25.080]  BS that they're trying to roll out there's this propaganda this anti-human
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:29.040]  propaganda has a finite timeline it doesn't it can't exist with logic
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.600]  common sense and reasoning it just it can't so it's at a fight it's at a finite
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:39.720]  timeline so Satan understands God's energy is coming back Satan understands
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:45.600]  that the energy of good and divine creation is rising and gaining momentum
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:51.200]  and so this is the desperate flailing attempts of the Satan demon possessed
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.680]  individuals to make Satan relevant again to bring Satan to the forefront again
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:01.600]  to engage in this this this demonic worship these demonic displays flaunting
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:05.880]  about because they know their time is short this this is the flaunting of a
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:11.680]  of a of a cornered animal this is the flaunting of a trapped demon they know
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:15.520]  the time is short Satan knows his time is short and so they're just going for
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:20.880]  broke and the way these Satanists look at it is if their time is short and if
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:24.440]  their time is coming to an end they're gonna do as much damage and as much
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:29.480]  destruction and take as many innocent lives as they can out with them as an
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:34.840]  homage to their to their deity which is Satan which is Lucifer and so that's
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:38.640]  why I just look at these next couple of months or years and I just say folks get
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.200]  yourself right whatever that means to you get yourself right because Satan's
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:49.400]  gonna have some some spouts of power here but then God returns the good news
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.800]  is the real red pill plus after over two years being sold out because the key

[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:24.200]  folks we have hilarious coping happening today at the Washington Post oh my
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:29.000]  gosh what are they gonna do Joe Biden is about to get up and lie to the American
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.600]  people for an hour straight tonight about the economy and everything so he's
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:37.920]  got all of his hacks and minions writing stories at the Washington Post why
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:43.040]  eggs are cheaper than you think is the headline but then they admit that they're
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:48.320]  doubled in price but compared to what your ancestors had access to you're
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:55.480]  extremely rich wow so is that is that the coping mechanism is that the argument
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:59.680]  now yeah the buy the Biden economy is the worst thing you've ever experienced
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:03.400]  in your life but compared to Neanderthals you know you're doing pretty
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:08.520]  good ah but it's you that want to bring us back to the Stone Age because you
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:14.240]  know man-made climate change gotcha it's just a hilarious clown show this this
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:20.360]  this entire Democrat liberal communist body is just fully enveloped in in
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:25.000]  Satanism because that's what reverse logic is that's what that's what gas
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.280]  lighting is that's what propaganda anti-human propaganda is it's just
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:34.960]  full-blown Satanism oh egg prices aren't that expensive and then they admit
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:37.600]  the story yeah they're double but compared to what your ancestors had
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:44.840]  access to gotcha gotcha I see you that's how you deal with that that's how you
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:50.720]  cope with that is it mm-hmm okay let's take a caller from Canada here we've
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.760]  got Jay on the line Jay you're on the air go ahead hi Owen thanks for taking my
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:02.200]  call I called in to share a discovery with you on the broadcast today along
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:09.240]  the way I've got an answer to Alex's question that he asked a couple years
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:17.200]  back it was that he wanted to someone to call in to show evidence of an extra
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:25.320]  planetary body now we can just draw a quick little diagram watch like the
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:39.000]  rules-chorus video this is not gonna take long okay okay so on a on a blank
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:45.720]  sheet of paper put the Sun in the middle and inside the Sun put the oscillating
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:53.400]  axis of the Sun and outside of that put the direction of the Sun's rotation
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:03:01.000]  which is counterclockwise we're looking at this from the south so below the Sun
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:10.040]  put Mercury put the line straight through it represent the the tidal lock now off
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:17.800]  to the right put all the other planets they all go around the same way which
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:26.160]  is counterclockwise Mercury Mercury goes around clockwise
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:39.640]  okay so can I get your crew to just find this short little video it's a video of
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:49.360]  colliding water in space and this video is the one that it's gonna look just like
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:59.480]  the solar system exactly the same all right so what's the conclusion here okay
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:05.520]  so from the bottom left hand corner of the page you're gonna draw a line going
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:09.840]  straight up to the Sun and you're gonna put the blue star that hit our star
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:18.440]  right beside it so in the video when you watch the video of colliding water it's
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:27.440]  gonna look exactly the same as our solar system so again the law of being came
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.680]  from our star that's the only place we could have come from what came from it
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:41.640]  what the lava under the ground they've only come from one place it came from
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:48.280]  our star all right Jay that is an interesting dissertation you just gave
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:55.800]  here on the Alex Jones show and to those following along at home well yeah
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:02.360]  here we go the good news is the real red pill plus after over two years being
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:05.840]  sold out because the key ingredients are unavailable but supply chain right

[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:33.520]  what kind of an embarrassment will we see from Joe Biden tonight at the State
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:37.440]  of the Union he's all hopped up they probably got him on like a he's
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:41.120]  probably in some sort of a chamber right now with wires and stuff and pumping in
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:46.960]  IVs everything probably looks like an alien freak show whatever it takes to
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:50.320]  get Joe Biden to be able to work for 60 minutes straight speak for 60 minute
[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:57.000]  straights a very rare occasion these days but it'll be a display no doubt get
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:02.240]  ready for historical levels of propaganda and lying perhaps the likes of
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:05.520]  which has never been seen during the State of the Union you are truly gonna
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:10.400]  see history in the making tonight with Joe Biden you're never gonna see a bigger
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:16.480]  liar you're never gonna see a bigger criminal a bigger fraud perpetuated on
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:20.760]  the American people then what Joe Biden is going to do tonight I'm certain and
[02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:24.880]  and then good good get Joe Biden up there tonight to tell Americans how
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:28.440]  they're doing better financially better economically than they ever have and
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:32.320]  America will hear that and say huh that's odd I'm completely broke living
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:36.240]  paycheck to paycheck grocery store bill I can't even afford now I'm not even
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:38.840]  sure if I'm to be able to afford to heat my house the rest of the winter but Joe

[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:51.320]  there and tell Americans it's the greatest economy ever not a single
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:59.640]  American is going to is going to say wow he's right wow that's true only the
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:04.760]  most brainwashed Stockholm syndrome bought and paid for liars are gonna go
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:07.800]  along with that message but get ready because you're gonna witness it it is
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:15.320]  going to be a spectacle no doubt and then don't be surprised if on the heels
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:18.720]  of this Russia just doesn't decide to make a move overnight just right on the
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:21.720]  heels of Joe Biden's speech will he'll probably say Ukraine is winning the war
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:24.600]  and then Russia might just say you know what let's just go in response to Joe
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:27.240]  Biden's speech let's just go ahead and take Ukraine let's go ahead and take the
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:36.560]  46 bio weapons Biden labs in Ukraine out be on the look for all of that all
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:44.480]  right let's go back to the phone lines here and we've got who's been holding
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:49.400]  the longest let me look as we've we've exhausted the first lineup of calls so
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.800]  we're moving on to number two let's see who's been holding the longest it's
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:57.840]  Jefferson in Virginia Jefferson you're on the air go ahead so the lava came
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:04.080]  from the Sun what the heck was that yeah you know what it's Canadians man they
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:07.720]  got a long winter to get through up there you know it's been a harsh winner
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:12.360]  they got Trudeau up there it's a problem all right speaking of Elon Musk I am
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:16.600]  pretty sure our military seems to be bamboozled by these balloons at 60,000
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:21.240]  feet somehow they can't deal with it any other way than to blow them up after
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:24.240]  they will now hold on after they complete their mission don't forget they
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:27.560]  have to complete its mission it has to traverse the entire country first then
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:33.240]  we can take it down yeah and destroy at the same time and make sure and make
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:36.360]  sure too that it goes in the ocean in the salt water so it's completely
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:41.160]  destroyed I mean look how dumb Jefferson you know it's but how dumb do people
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:46.840]  have to be I mean just 60 years ago they could land a lunar capsule in the
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:50.920]  ocean and there'd be an entire fleet out there ready to corral it and bring the
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.600]  people back up but they can't figure out oh then the satellite crashes at the
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:59.920]  bottom of the ocean we don't know what to do so Elon Musk and SpaceX probably
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:04.200]  could figure out this problem in about a day if they were given a contract by the
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:08.160]  DOD to figure out how to bring down a balloon in one piece from 60,000 feet
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:12.960]  they have rockets that can hover in place at 60,000 feet so you could just
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:17.400]  throw a cargo net over the damn thing and you and I you and I could sit here
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:20.200]  and just have a chat for 10 minutes we could probably come up with a hundred
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.320]  different ways to bring that thing down right I might self-destruct so you don't
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:28.560]  want to have a person there that might get killed in the process but but I'm
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:32.720]  pretty sure we could the idea that we don't know how to bring them down with
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:38.120]  parachutes in replacement of the buoyancy of the balloon is just mind
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:42.680]  boggling that were this the inept and that's a lie it's just a lie they they
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:45.720]  protected that balloon for whatever reason that balloon was given the
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:50.760]  protection but Joe Biden protected that balloon and they're saying they'd known
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.760]  about the balloons for all through the Trump administration so well it looks
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.720]  like they got caught in a giant lie there I'll get to this news now that you
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.560]  mentioned it so folks they lied they they lied about the balloons during Trump
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:08.320]  it was all the cover and now General Mattis so it went like this they said
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:12.120]  the Pentagon said well there were there were three spy balloons during the
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:16.960]  Trump years and then Trump said that's not true other administrators that were
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:22.180]  there for Trump said that's not true even generals like Mattis that weren't
[02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:26.800]  behind Trump are now denying it so then they say well the DoD told
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:32.440]  representative Waltz and now the rest of other military generals are saying none
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.520]  of this happened so so was there ever balloons what did they really just tell
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:40.280]  one person are we talking about trees in here where they have information on
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:44.360]  Chinese surveillance over the US and they don't tell the president so this whole
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.600]  lie has completely blown up in their face General Mattis denies the reports
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:53.560]  he's no Trumper says he had no knowledge of the balloons flying over the US
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:57.640]  during his time as Secretary of Defense so they literally just made it up and
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:01.800]  lied and said it was worse during Trump they completely just made it up
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:08.200]  Jefferson well this their cover story now is that they miscategorized them as
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:15.400]  unidentified flying a phenomenon oh yes it was a domain categorization mistake
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.000]  made by somebody in the technocracy so they didn't realize that they were a
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.320]  surveillance balloons until Trump was out of office and that's when they
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:27.840]  realized oh these aerial phenomenon are balloons and I'm going to be we were
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:31.680]  supposed to be on the lookout for balloons ever since World War two this
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:37.560]  is not really a new idea right it's just the stuff they get away with and Jim
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:40.960]  Jordan on the Judiciary Committee doesn't have subpoenas out for these people
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:44.680]  to all come forward at the same time and sit there like a bunch of monkeys at a
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:49.560]  table and explain how you all missed this and weren't told about it and who
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:55.720]  failed to tell you about balloons over America and it's just well you're
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:59.640]  absolutely right there should be hearings on this and the problem is Jim
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:05.520]  Jordan is juggling about six different elements of deep state corruption that
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:09.080]  he wants to have hearings on and so this is just like another thing to throw in
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:13.480]  there I just think he just can't handle it at this point yes well we can always
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:16.520]  use the overwhelm but this is pretty simple you just send out subpoenas and
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:21.280]  say appear at this date and we'll just ask questions of each of you as how did
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:24.160]  you not get told about this what this story doesn't make a lot of sense
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:28.720]  somebody's a treasonous actor in your chain of command and you should be
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:32.480]  looking for who that was before you can come to testify 100% you're 100% right
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.160]  and then the Biden says well we had to wait to shoot it down over the ocean to
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:41.360]  avoid lives or casualties which is just a total lie but even if that was true then
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:45.320]  why didn't you shoot it down over the Pacific Ocean you apparently were
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:49.160]  tracking this thing out of mainland China it was over the Pacific Ocean before
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:52.720]  it hit Alaska why didn't you shoot it down then I mean everything is a lie
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:57.520]  everything yep and they get away with it because they just muddy up the water
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:01.520]  and then they move on to the next you know false narrative and we we don't
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.360]  ever resolve anything that's right in the only fashion that's right and so it's
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.600]  like what is the next distraction gonna be we have a Pfizer executive admitting
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:12.760]  the vaccines are a huge scandal admitting gain of function research and
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:17.840]  then oh shiny balloon speaking of shiny balloon have you seen those indoor
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:21.160]  derogables that are remote control that can fly around the room they have a
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:24.120]  fish that looks like it's swimming through the air that would be hilarious
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:30.280]  to have that flying around in the chamber yeah yeah yeah yeah I know what
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:33.520]  you're talking about they got a little fin on it and like a little fan right
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:36.520]  right doesn't have to be a balloon it can just be anything floating through the
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:40.560]  air but see I think the optics I think the optics of the white balloon would be
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.800]  the most powerful because everybody looked at the balloon it was the viral
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:47.200]  image of the week everybody knows the balloon I mean you can even put a
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:51.280]  little like Lego satellite like a little like Lego satellite at the bottom of it
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:54.600]  have flown around during the state of the Union I mean that'd be hilarious and
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:59.160]  and I can already hear the response from Republicans and from you know
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:05.040]  conservative conservative establishment press well we have there's decorum
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:09.360]  there's decorum in Congress we have to have respect for the processing of
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:18.280]  decorum respect this Congress hates you the US government is raping us we have a
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:22.920]  wide open border don't tell me about decorum we have a president stealing our
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:28.600]  money giving it to Ukraine don't tell me about respect they censor us they
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:34.240]  arrest us they have gulags for us decorum and respect is gonna be your
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:38.440]  concern heading into the state of the Union from a president that's a crook
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:44.600]  and criminal no if your decorum if your respect they have no decorum and respect
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:49.080]  when dealing with us why should we give them that no there should be the
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.800]  Republicans should float a white balloon the entire time Biden is speaking
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:16:01.200]  tonight decorum give me a break there is a war on for your mind your mind is a
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:07.440]  battlefield this is an information war info wars popularized those terms more

[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:13.080]  I want you all to know something Alex Jones was right Alex is right about far more things wrong
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:16.160]  Alex has been right on for over a decade
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:19.920]  I don't care how you slice it dice it flip it up or rub it down
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.440]  Alex Jones was right
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:28.520]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:37.000]  Who've been awake for like decades Alex Jones called this years ago years ago Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax not for a second
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:43.760]  You are one of the great thinkers of this you are a martyr to the First Amendment the government
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:53.560]  The years Alex Jones, that's why the globalist hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:55.560]  Alex Jones live.com
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:03.680]  In the year 2000 Alex Jones's film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:10.720]  Showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:16.200]  In 2007 Alex Jones releases endgame
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:26.040]  exposing the world elites plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind and by the time they launched their attack in
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:35.200]  2020 Alex Jones's info wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:37.320]  This is why they attack us
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:43.560]  This is why we need your support because we tell the truth Alex Jones was right
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.040]  Join the resistance buy products donate to the cause
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:54.840]  Share the links join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:20:05.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:32.800]  It's hard to imagine it gets much worse than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris it just
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:36.500]  It's hard to imagine it gets much worse and now
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:41.760]  New York Times articles suggest Democrats have given up on Kamala Harris for 2024
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:47.040]  Well, they never they never were giving her anything other than she was just the token
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:48.800]  black
[02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:50.800]  female vice president
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:55.960]  Hoping that they could deceive black people into voting for clearly racist Joe Biden
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:00.320]  With his racist history and his drug laws his racist comments
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:02.960]  connections to the KKK
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:07.800]  So they thought let's put Kamala up there as our token black woman and we'll get the black vote
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:10.600]  We'll get the woman vote, but she's a complete joke. I
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:15.120]  Mean any every time she speaks in public every time she does a public presentation
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:18.520]  You can see she's totally out of her element. She doesn't know what to do
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:22.960]  So she just starts cackling and giggling hysterically to try to distract
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:28.480]  From the fact that she is way out of her league and does not belong anywhere
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:35.040]  And the only reason she was ever able to get a leg up was because she went under the desk of governor
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:41.240]  Willie Brown and here now she finds herself the vice president a complete joke a laughingstock of the country
[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:48.720]  So no, she was never a serious contender. She was a token black woman to once again deceive
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:54.680]  Black voters and female voters in America to vote Democrat against their best interests
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:22:01.560]  But she'll be up there tonight looking like a complete clown and probably cackling
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:04.800]  She'll probably do some sort of a stunt to get attention to herself as well
[02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:13.040]  It's hard to imagine it gets much worse than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, I just don't see they do not see how it gets worse
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:18.960]  We're taking your calls on all of this and we've had some great calls so far
[02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:22.080]  today and
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:23.080]  so
[02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:26.920]  We go back to the lines now and let's go to
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:30.400]  Presley in North Carolina Presley are on the air go ahead
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.360]  Good afternoon afternoon. Thanks Colin
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:42.560]  No problem. Just wanted to talk about an experience. I had with my state employees credit union about a year and a half ago
[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:45.240]  trying to withdraw some funds and
[02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:52.440]  Basically the amount was too much for them to give me at the time and they were telling me to
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.720]  Give them heads up notice like a week to order that amount of money
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:01.720]  Basically so they could have it available for me out of my account now. You don't need to give exact figures here
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:06.800]  But would would you expect that type of withdrawal would would be unable to be?
[02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:09.560]  matched
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:12.720]  It shouldn't have been a problem
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:17.320]  No, and I asked the manager. I said, well, what do you expect gonna happen if?
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:23.040]  20 people come in here and demand this. What are you gonna do and he just kind of looked at me blankly? Yeah
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:28.480]  Well, look, I mean the whole FTX scandal is no doubt a scandal and by the way, there's some breaking news there
[02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:37.200]  FTX is sending letters to politicians who receive donations from FTX to return the money they received and
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:40.040]  Of course, they probably have already spent it
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.840]  now
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:44.840]  We have that list
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:50.880]  Unusual whales has published that list and you can see here. It's the vast majority of it going to Democrats
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:56.040]  It's 90% of the FTX stolen money went to Democrats about 10% went to Republicans
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:58.440]  and
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:00.720]  so they're demanding that money back and
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:08.400]  Here's the thing though. There's no doubt that FTX and Sam bankman freed was a giant scandal
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:13.680]  It was a scandal from the very beginning bankman freed and Ellison were set up as the fall guy and the fall girl
[02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:19.520]  They're probably not too bright of people. I'm not trying to be mean. They probably have learning disabilities or something else
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:26.600]  They were set up as the fall guys. The whole thing was the money laundering operation. They got caught because people in crypto
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:33.320]  Actually care about the integrity of financial institutions and actually care that people can have their money
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:37.440]  Protected so they basically called out the FTX scandal
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:43.000]  They made a bet that if you did a run on FTX that the coffers would be empty and
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:50.820]  And they guessed right and now the whole thing collapsed even though bankman freed is nestled safely in his parents mansion in California
[02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:53.320]  And no criminals have been arrested now
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:58.800]  Here's why your story plays right into this the exact same phenomenon
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:04.400]  That happened at FTX with the run on FTX and they're saying oh, we don't have your money
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:09.400]  They never had it the exact same thing would happen probably at 90% of banks tomorrow
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:14.400]  And so, you know, folks, I don't really get into this
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:22.640]  But I'm just gonna tell you I've I've I've made I've made financial decisions and in this week that I never thought I'd make again and
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:27.400]  I'm I'm leaning on actually getting all my money out of the bank
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:33.960]  And this is something I would have never recommended or never thought I would do before but I'm now considering getting all my money
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:36.460]  Out of the bank for this exact reason Presley
[02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:41.340]  I totally agree with you and I'm glad this happened to me a year and a half ago
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:48.820]  And I was able to see the writing on the wall because bail ins are definitely gonna happen because if they didn't have my money a year and a half ago
[02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:56.180]  It's gonna be horrible tomorrow. They don't have it. And so that it's almost in a way. They're anticipating this and
[02:25:57.180 --> 02:26:01.020]  This is gonna be how they draw us into the digital currency trap
[02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:06.380]  Because it's almost inevitable and and that's why it's like a dangerous thing
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:11.820]  It's like do we press the bank run now and do we do we show the corruption of the central banks?
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:13.820]  Do we show the corruption of the Federal Reserve?
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:16.300]  but
[02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:22.620]  Understanding that that could collapse the entire country economically. It's like do we really want to press that button?
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:25.140]  I mean, this is a very delicate balancing act here
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:30.540]  I totally agree with you, but we're kind of a
[02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:36.260]  Lesser or two evil situation at this point and then we might have to expose the corruption
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:40.940]  Well, and I think people are just gonna have to make their own decisions and like I said
[02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:44.260]  I mean, I've you know, I've got myself prepped and ready to go for the worst
[02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:51.180]  But now it's like I'm looking at a situation where it's like, okay, if the worst happens tomorrow or if the worst happens a month from today
[02:26:51.180 --> 02:26:56.740]  What do I want to do or what am I gonna wish I had done or what do I need to do?
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:27:00.420]  Because to me, I'm just looking at this man. We've got psychotic
[02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:05.780]  Killers running our country. I mean, let's call it what it is. We've got psychotic mad scientist
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:13.460]  maniacal villains running our country and the world knows it and if we the American people aren't gonna handle it somebody else is
[02:27:15.180 --> 02:27:19.540]  Totally and also, what's your take on all the Google layoffs?
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:25.700]  It's just the economy's collapsing. It's just I mean, it's just collapsing. It's big text doing that
[02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:30.540]  I mean, it's it's over. It's not just Google. It's it's Amazon. It's Apple
[02:27:30.540 --> 02:27:36.540]  It's it's it's they're all it's it's collapsing folks the economy's collapsing under Joe Biden and he can sit here and tell you
[02:27:36.540 --> 02:27:42.180]  He's gonna tell you it's the greatest economy ever tonight. He's gonna tell you record economic growth and all the other BS tonight
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:44.180]  It's just a total lie
[02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:47.620]  God help us man
[02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:50.620]  Presley, thank you for the call and amen to that. All right, ladies and gentlemen

[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:03.620]  But if you're on the board, I'm gonna try to get to your call in the last two segments again

[02:30:05.620 --> 02:30:07.620]  The chief scientific officer of the company
[02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:10.620]  I contribute with like so many else do there
[02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:12.620]  So many wonderful doctors
[02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:14.620]  Far and away the most popular product
[02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:17.620]  Is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement
[02:30:17.620 --> 02:30:19.620]  That features natokinase
[02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:21.620]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme
[02:30:21.620 --> 02:30:24.620]  This one is the only enzyme
[02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:25.620]  That we're aware of right now
[02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:27.620]  That dissolves the spike protein
[02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:28.620]  This is very important
[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:30.620]  The spike protein is loaded in the body
[02:30:30.620 --> 02:30:31.620]  With the COVID-19 infection
[02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:33.620]  And definitely with the vaccines
[02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:34.620]  People are lower with the spike protein
[02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:35.620]  They don't feel well
[02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:37.620]  This is a potential solution
[02:30:37.620 --> 02:30:40.620]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance
[02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:43.620]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase
[02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:44.620]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:46.620]  Natural substances in a sense
[02:30:46.620 --> 02:30:48.620]  Combating this man-made disaster
[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.620]  SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines

[02:32:14.620 --> 02:32:17.620]  And behold
[02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:19.620]  A pale horse
[02:32:19.620 --> 02:32:22.620]  And he that sat
[02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:25.620]  On the horse
[02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:30.620]  Was named Death
[02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:31.620]  Another translation is
[02:32:31.620 --> 02:32:33.620]  I looked
[02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:36.620]  And behold a pale horse
[02:32:36.620 --> 02:32:38.620]  And his name that sat on him was Death
[02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:41.620]  And hell followed with him
[02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:44.620]  A book of Revelation
[02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:46.620]  Very serious times to be alive folks
[02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:47.620]  They're not just doing this as a one off
[02:32:47.620 --> 02:32:49.620]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives
[02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:50.620]  This is our fight
[02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:52.620]  And I'm proud of humanity
[02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:53.620]  The globalists even admit it's leaked
[02:32:53.620 --> 02:32:55.620]  They're very upset that they're losing
[02:32:55.620 --> 02:33:23.620]  And that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:33.620]  Now your host, Owen Troyer
[02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:35.620]  America bracing for the lies
[02:33:35.620 --> 02:33:37.620]  They're about to be told by Joe Biden tonight
[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:39.620]  By the way, Karine Jean-Pierre
[02:33:39.620 --> 02:33:41.620]  Is lying for Joe right now
[02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:43.620]  But I'm gonna play some clips from the press conference
[02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:45.620]  Coming up on the war room
[02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:47.620]  I've got a regularly scheduled war room today
[02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:49.620]  With clips and guests and news coverage
[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:51.620]  But here on the Alex Jones show
[02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:53.620]  Alex wanted me to take a bunch of your calls
[02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:55.620]  And I was in Patica with him on that
[02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:57.620]  Dealing with all the issues
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:33:59.620]  Reaching out to the human intelligence
[02:33:59.620 --> 02:34:01.620]  And so we go back to the phone lines now

[02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.620]  Judy, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:25.620]  Hi, Owen, it's good to speak with you again
[02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:27.620]  Hi, thanks for calling
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:30.620]  Yeah, I just wanted to jump right into
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:32.620]  What I feel is important
[02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:35.620]  You said something about basically
[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:38.620]  We're getting to the point in human history
[02:34:38.620 --> 02:34:41.620]  Where I'm just gonna say that
[02:34:41.620 --> 02:34:44.620]  God is going to return more than likely
[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:47.620]  I'm gonna read a bit
[02:34:47.620 --> 02:34:50.620]  This is out of Matthew
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:53.620]  This is out of chapter 10
[02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:56.620]  Whoever there for shall confess me before
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:59.620]  Man, him I will confess also before my father
[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:01.620]  Which is in heaven
[02:35:01.620 --> 02:35:04.620]  And whoever shall deny me before
[02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:07.620]  Man, him I shall also deny before my father
[02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:09.620]  Which is in heaven
[02:35:09.620 --> 02:35:11.620]  And the reason why that's important to me
[02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:14.620]  Is that I don't know which is more likely
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:16.620]  That, you know, patriots are going to take
[02:35:16.620 --> 02:35:20.620]  America back or the rapture is going to occur
[02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:23.620]  And from my perspective
[02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:25.620]  All I can see is that
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:27.620]  If anybody goes underground
[02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:29.620]  If they think they're going to be safe there
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:32.620]  There's bunker busters and there's God Almighty himself
[02:35:32.620 --> 02:35:35.620]  They can take every bit of their cities
[02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:38.620]  And what they're extracting as far as food
[02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:41.620]  That's left for the human or the population
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:44.620]  Here in America and taking it underground with them
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:47.620]  They're going to be in for a very rude awakening
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:49.620]  But the other thing I want to take out of scripture
[02:35:49.620 --> 02:35:53.620]  And this is out of John chapter 14
[02:35:53.620 --> 02:35:56.620]  Which is the same John out of the book of Revelation
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:35:58.620]  In a much earlier time
[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:00.620]  This is Thomas, doubting Thomas
[02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:04.620]  That is speaking in chapter 14 verse 5
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:06.620]  Thomas says it's under him
[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:09.620]  Lord, we know not whether you go
[02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:12.620]  And how can we know the way
[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:16.620]  Jesus says out to him in verse 6
[02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:19.620]  I am the way, the truth, and the life
[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:23.620]  No man cometh to the Father, but by me
[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:26.620]  And the reason why Christians are so hated
[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:30.620]  Is because we recognize who God is
[02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:33.620]  And we believe in the triune God
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:35.620]  Because once you receive Jesus
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:37.620]  You are indwelt with the Holy Spirit
[02:36:37.620 --> 02:36:39.620]  And it's only through the Holy Spirit
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:43.620]  That we have any type of discernment whatsoever
[02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:47.620]  The reason why the globalists hate Christianity
[02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:49.620]  Is because it's the values of Christianity
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:52.620]  And quite frankly it's Islam too
[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:54.620]  It's really any religion
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:56.620]  But the globalists are at war with religion
[02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:58.620]  They want it to be replaced
[02:36:58.620 --> 02:37:00.620]  Right now the agenda is to get you to replace
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:02.620]  Religion with your sexuality
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:04.620]  That's why they have all the sex flags
[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:07.620]  And that's why they want you to worship
[02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:11.620]  These sex freak binaries like
[02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:14.620]  Sam Smith at the Grammys
[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:18.620]  Because they know that Christianity and Islam
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:20.620]  Just using two examples
[02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:22.620]  Cannot coexist with their corporate world government
[02:37:22.620 --> 02:37:26.620]  Cannot coexist with destroying genders
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:29.620]  Destroying gender roles, destroying children
[02:37:29.620 --> 02:37:31.620]  Mutilating their bodies
[02:37:31.620 --> 02:37:33.620]  And so the reason why they have to destroy God
[02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:36.620]  In Christianity is because it's the only moral compass
[02:37:36.620 --> 02:37:38.620]  And it's the only group of people that will
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:40.620]  Morally stand in the way of this corporate
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:42.620]  World government Satanism
[02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:45.620]  That is using sexual preference
[02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:48.620]  Or sexual activity in the flags
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:51.620]  As the replacement for religion and a nation state
[02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:53.620]  And so that's why religion and God
[02:37:53.620 --> 02:37:55.620]  Must be destroyed by these people
[02:37:55.620 --> 02:37:57.620]  That's why Christianity and America are such under attack
[02:37:57.620 --> 02:37:59.620]  Judy, thank you for the call
[02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:01.620]  Let's go to Jerry and Arizona
[02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:03.620]  Jerry, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:07.620]  I'll tell you what, if there's ever a time to pray
[02:38:07.620 --> 02:38:09.620]  Jerry, do me a favor
[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:11.620]  Do me a favor and get yourself off speakerphone
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:13.620]  I'm having trouble hearing you
[02:38:13.620 --> 02:38:14.620]  Okay, hold on
[02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:15.620]  What about now?
[02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:16.620]  Good
[02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:17.620]  Okay
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:19.620]  Man, if there's ever a time
[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:21.620]  If there was ever a time to pray
[02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:23.620]  It's right now for this country
[02:38:23.620 --> 02:38:25.620]  And even for our enemies, brother
[02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:27.620]  I mean, I've got the hair on the back of my neck
[02:38:27.620 --> 02:38:28.620]  Standing up
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:30.620]  Well look, I don't look at the Ukrainian people
[02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:31.620]  As my enemy
[02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:32.620]  I don't look at the Chinese people as my enemy
[02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:34.620]  I don't look at the Russian people as my enemy
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:36.620]  They're all in this like we are
[02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:38.620]  They're all at the behest of these psychotic world murderers
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:39.620]  Like we are
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:42.620]  The Ukrainian people know Zelensky is a rat
[02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:45.620]  Yeah, you've got the brainwash left in Ukraine
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:46.620]  Just like you have in America
[02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:48.620]  But folks, I'm telling you
[02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:50.620]  The world knows Zelensky is a corrupt criminal
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:52.620]  They know he's a fascist Nazi
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:55.620]  It's just the media perpetuating this giant hoax
[02:38:55.620 --> 02:38:57.620]  That the criminal is the good guy
[02:38:57.620 --> 02:38:58.620]  Okay
[02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:03.620]  Looks like, did we lose him?
[02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:05.620]  Sorry about that
[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:09.620]  Okay, let's go to Brian in Tennessee
[02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:11.620]  Brian, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:13.620]  Okay
[02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:16.620]  Hello?
[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:17.620]  You're on the air, yep
[02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:19.620]  Okay, okay, okay
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:21.620]  How's it going on? How are you?
[02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:24.620]  I'm good, what's on your mind?
[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:27.620]  Well, I just want to let you know that
[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:30.620]  There are about at least four ways to defeat the globalist
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:33.620]  Number one, we need to be as self-reliant as possible
[02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:36.620]  Number two
[02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:39.620]  We need to make sure
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:45.620]  We need to make sure that our children know what's going on too
[02:39:45.620 --> 02:39:47.620]  That they don't give into the lies
[02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:48.620]  That's all in school
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:51.620]  Absolutely, that's why they're under such assault right now
[02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:52.620]  With the propaganda
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:55.620]  Yeah, and number three
[02:39:55.620 --> 02:39:58.620]  We need to get our hearts right before God
[02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:00.620]  We need to repent of our sins
[02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:01.620]  We need to get in prayer
[02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:03.620]  Just like the last caller said
[02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:05.620]  We need to engage in spiritual warfare
[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:06.620]  Because remember
[02:40:07.620 --> 02:40:09.620]  Our battle is not against flesh and blood
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:11.620]  It's against the principalities
[02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:12.620]  Against the dark forces
[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:15.620]  Because I'm a prophet of God
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:16.620]  I'm 30 years old
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:18.620]  And it's just right now
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:20.620]  As much as I would like to get married
[02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:22.620]  I'm looking at the world and I'm like
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:24.620]  No, not yet
[02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:26.620]  Because I don't want my kids to be born into a world
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:28.620]  And this is going on
[02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:31.620]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:32.620]  And that's the thing
[02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:35.620]  And that's the reason why it's not that men don't want to get married
[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:38.620]  They don't want their children born into an apocalyptic world
[02:40:38.620 --> 02:40:39.620]  Like this
[02:40:39.620 --> 02:40:41.620]  That's definitely an element
[02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:44.620]  Yeah, and the main thing is
[02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:46.620]  The fourth thing is this
[02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:47.620]  Number one
[02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:49.620]  Our enemies are watching this show
[02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:51.620]  So here's the thing
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:54.620]  The solutions and the battle plans
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:56.620]  It's best to keep them under reps
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:40:59.620]  We have to be unpredictable when it comes to these
[02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:01.620]  Devil worshipers because you've got to understand
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:03.620]  We have to go to God for our strategies
[02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:05.620]  And keep it to ourselves
[02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:08.620]  And take the enemies that Satan is using by surprise
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:10.620]  And last thing
[02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:12.620]  The Joe Biden that's in the White House
[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:13.620]  God gave me a dream
[02:41:13.620 --> 02:41:14.620]  That's not the real Joe Biden
[02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:15.620]  Because guess what?
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:17.620]  Biden took the shot
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:19.620]  How old do you think he is?
[02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:21.620]  He's like 78 years old
[02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:23.620]  Old people have collapsed and dropped dead
[02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:25.620]  Because it simplifies the vaccine
[02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:26.620]  Think about it
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:29.620]  What goes on behind closed doors in the White House
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:30.620]  It saves us that
[02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:33.620]  Well, and who knows if he even really took the vaccine
[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:36.620]  Who knows if they're not just kidding him
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:37.620]  Some sugar water
[02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:38.620]  Some saline or something
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:41.620]  But, you know, Brian, you said something
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:42.620]  That reminded me
[02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:46.620]  And I completely forgot to mention this earlier
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:49.620]  It was in my stack of news to cover on the war room
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:51.620]  But, you know, I'll just put it out there now
[02:41:51.620 --> 02:41:54.620]  Folks, it was probably about a week ago
[02:41:54.620 --> 02:41:56.620]  And it wasn't just myself on the war room
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:41:58.620]  Saying this false flag inevitable
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:00.620]  But, you know, Alex understanding this
[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:02.620]  Obviously as well and others out there
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:05.620]  But I'm going to tell you right now
[02:42:05.620 --> 02:42:09.620]  They're getting ready to do a big false flag in Ukraine
[02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:12.620]  They're going to blow up a medical hospital
[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:15.620]  And they already have the corrupt western media
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:17.620]  Out there in Ukraine right now
[02:42:17.620 --> 02:42:18.620]  We know what hotel they're at
[02:42:18.620 --> 02:42:19.620]  They're at the Sapphire Hotel
[02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:22.620]  The whole script has already been laid out
[02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:27.620]  So, you know, maybe reporting this news
[02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:30.620]  And getting this out there can stop it from happening
[02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:33.620]  But, you know, these criminals, they're not done
[02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:35.620]  You don't think that Biden and Zelensky
[02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:37.620]  Aren't going to reach back into that cookie jar
[02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:39.620]  For another hundred billion dollars
[02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:43.620]  So there is a giant false flag planned in Ukraine
[02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:45.620]  They're going to blow up a medical facility
[02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:47.620]  They're going to show you dead children
[02:42:47.620 --> 02:42:49.620]  And they already have the media out there
[02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:51.620]  Ready to report on it
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:53.620]  And so we might be able to stop it
[02:42:53.620 --> 02:42:55.620]  But I'm just telling you, they're getting ready for it, folks
[02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:00.620]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[02:43:00.620 --> 02:43:01.620]  Info Wars has had
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:03.620]  I don't think anybody can deny it
[02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:07.620]  And it is because of Lister's viewers supporting us
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:09.620]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars
[02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:12.620]  People behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers
[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:16.620]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight
[02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:19.620]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:21.620]  And the hard work they engage in every day
[02:43:21.620 --> 02:43:23.620]  Five, six, seven days a week
[02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:25.620]  It's really just incredible
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:27.620]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew
[02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:29.620]  I thank you for your past support
[02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:31.620]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:34.620]  Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us
[02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:36.620]  I know you spread the word
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:37.620]  I know you pray for us
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:38.620]  And that's wonderful, keep doing it
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:40.620]  But most viewers and listeners
[02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:42.620]  Never go to InfoWarsTour.com
[02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:45.620]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[02:43:45.620 --> 02:43:47.620]  All at the same time, keep us on air
[02:43:47.620 --> 02:43:49.620]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners
[02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:51.620]  Actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com
[02:43:51.620 --> 02:43:53.620]  If just one percent more of you took action
[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:55.620]  And went to InfoWarsTour.com
[02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:56.620]  Our fighting problems will be over
[02:43:56.620 --> 02:44:11.620]  Please take action now
[02:44:26.620 --> 02:44:29.620]  If they can convince you that we're going away
[02:44:29.620 --> 02:44:30.620]  And you stop supporting
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:31.620]  You stop spreading the word
[02:44:31.620 --> 02:44:33.620]  Then they do win
[02:44:33.620 --> 02:44:36.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:37.620]  That can shut down Info Wars
[02:44:37.620 --> 02:44:39.620]  And that's you, the viewers and listeners
[02:44:39.620 --> 02:44:41.620]  If you decide we're done, we're done
[02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:43.620]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTour.com
[02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:45.620]  Against supplements and books and films
[02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:46.620]  And t-shirts and so much more
[02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:48.620]  We will stay on the air indefinitely
[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:50.620]  It is all in your hands
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:51.620]  So thanks for your support
[02:44:51.620 --> 02:44:52.620]  Stand up against the globalists
[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:54.620]  Go to InfoWarsTour.com right now
[02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:55.620]  And keep us on air
[02:44:55.620 --> 02:44:57.620]  It's up to you
[02:44:57.620 --> 02:44:59.620]  In early 2022
[02:44:59.620 --> 02:45:01.620]  InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser
[02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:03.620]  That kept us on air
[02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:05.620]  Your support of that fundraiser
[02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:08.620]  Is the reason we are still here today
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:09.620]  Fighting the globalist
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:12.620]  And having incredibly successful results
[02:45:12.620 --> 02:45:14.620]  So I thank you for your passive support
[02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:16.620]  Now that was a three coin series
[02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:17.620]  The founding member coin
[02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:20.620]  The final coin that we're putting out
[02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:21.620]  For a long time
[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:23.620]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt
[02:45:23.620 --> 02:45:26.620]  Man in the arena coin

[02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:34.620]  Of the coins left
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:36.620]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins
[02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:38.620]  Because that's why it's a fundraiser
[02:45:38.620 --> 02:45:40.620]  The coin is a collector's item
[02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:41.620]  Memento of your support

[02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:23.620]  On InfoWars live transmissions
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:25.620]  We've got Maria Z and Mike Adams
[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:27.620]  Coming up with big news
[02:47:27.620 --> 02:47:29.620]  In the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show today
[02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:31.620]  I'm back hosting the war room
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:33.620]  I'm going to have guest
[02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:35.620]  Jamie Mitchell, founder of Gays Against Groomers
[02:47:35.620 --> 02:47:38.620]  To respond to what happened in Oklahoma
[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:40.620]  Where a bunch of radical leftist
[02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:42.620]  Communist trans activists
[02:47:42.620 --> 02:47:45.620]  Occupied the state capitol building
[02:47:45.620 --> 02:47:47.620]  Oh, it's terrorism
[02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:51.620]  Oh, it's sedition
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:52.620]  Oh, it's insurrection
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:54.620]  No, not when liberals do it
[02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:56.620]  Not when leftists and commies do it
[02:47:56.620 --> 02:47:58.620]  So they can chop little boys' penises off
[02:47:58.620 --> 02:47:59.620]  And chop little girls' breasts off
[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:01.620]  Then it's a good thing, you see

[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:51.620]  Thank you, Owen, for taking my call
[02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:53.620]  Hopefully
[02:48:53.620 --> 02:48:55.620]  You can go back and review this
[02:48:55.620 --> 02:48:57.620]  And pass this on to somebody
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:00.620]  I've heard about a week
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:03.620]  Alex Jones was talking to Mr. McCullough
[02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:06.620]  And he said that
[02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:08.620]  A compound called natokinase
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:11.620]  Can break down the spike proteins
[02:49:11.620 --> 02:49:13.620]  That are accumulating in people's blood
[02:49:13.620 --> 02:49:15.620]  And I'm just going to go straight
[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:17.620]  To the important stuff
[02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:19.620]  Because it took me down
[02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:21.620]  An interesting little rabbit hole
[02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:23.620]  I learned of two more enzymes
[02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:25.620]  One slumbrokinase
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:27.620]  And the other seropeptase
[02:49:27.620 --> 02:49:29.620]  And they're also both natural
[02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:31.620]  And not only will they also
[02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:33.620]  Help with the spike proteins
[02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:35.620]  But there are a couple of groups
[02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:37.620]  That have been doing research in these
[02:49:37.620 --> 02:49:39.620]  Actually going back
[02:49:39.620 --> 02:49:41.620]  From one article back from 2009
[02:49:41.620 --> 02:49:43.620]  And not only will they start
[02:49:43.620 --> 02:49:45.620]  Breaking down those spike proteins
[02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:47.620]  But they also start breaking down
[02:49:47.620 --> 02:49:49.620]  Biofilms that form in the mind
[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:51.620]  Or form in the body
[02:49:51.620 --> 02:49:53.620]  I jumped ahead of myself
[02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:55.620]  And so samples of diseases
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:57.620]  That will affect sometimes diseases
[02:49:57.620 --> 02:49:59.620]  Like Lyme disease
[02:49:59.620 --> 02:50:01.620]  The bacteria will form a colony
[02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:03.620]  When the environment becomes hostile
[02:50:03.620 --> 02:50:05.620]  And secrete these proteins
[02:50:05.620 --> 02:50:07.620]  And form a biofilm and hide from
[02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:09.620]  The immune system
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:11.620]  It rips it away and lets the immune system
[02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:13.620]  Get to it and helps your body
[02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:15.620]  Actually fight the disease
[02:50:15.620 --> 02:50:17.620]  Or other diseases where it may build up
[02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:19.620]  In like nerves or in the brain
[02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:21.620]  Or like fibromyalgia and autism
[02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:23.620]  And so you can start breaking these biofilms
[02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:25.620]  Down and start curing those diseases
[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:27.620]  As well
[02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:29.620]  This is wild and I don't mean to get off track here
[02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:31.620]  But you know I know people
[02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:33.620]  That have fibromyalgia
[02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:35.620]  I know particularly older women
[02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:37.620]  Will be completely a miserable
[02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:39.620]  And debilitating experience
[02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:41.620]  And they're told there's no solution
[02:50:41.620 --> 02:50:43.620]  They just told nothing we can do
[02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:45.620]  Well if Mr. McCullough
[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:47.620]  Had never said that
[02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:49.620]  I never would have followed this rabbit trail
[02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:51.620]  So a couple of spots to look
[02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:53.620]  Look up Westin A Price Foundation
[02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:55.620]  And look up a Dr. Petticoen
[02:50:55.620 --> 02:50:57.620]  Out in New Jersey
[02:50:57.620 --> 02:50:59.620]  And they both have information on it
[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:01.620]  Now that's the important
[02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:03.620]  I'll tell you how I found this
[02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:05.620]  I'm a software developer
[02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:07.620]  I'm not a doctor
[02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:09.620]  But one of my customers is the Westin A Price Foundation
[02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:11.620]  So when Mr. McCullough
[02:51:11.620 --> 02:51:13.620]  Said that
[02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:15.620]  I fired off an email to them
[02:51:15.620 --> 02:51:17.620]  And said hey have you heard of this
[02:51:17.620 --> 02:51:19.620]  And the guy that I know
[02:51:19.620 --> 02:51:21.620]  Over there says oh yes I've heard of this
[02:51:21.620 --> 02:51:23.620]  We've been talking about this for quite some time
[02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:25.620]  So look at this email
[02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:27.620]  He gives me the information
[02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:29.620]  And so I go look at our
[02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:31.620]  You're looking through this stuff
[02:51:31.620 --> 02:51:33.620]  Talking about this in 2021
[02:51:33.620 --> 02:51:35.620]  They were on
[02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:37.620]  A long time ago
[02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:39.620]  And I'm sitting here just reading this back and forth
[02:51:39.620 --> 02:51:41.620]  The email from them
[02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:43.620]  And getting like links to them
[02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:45.620]  So that's how I found the Dr. Petticoen
[02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:47.620]  And it was just one of them
[02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:49.620]  Said yeah we were talking about this
[02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:51.620]  Go look at this thread
[02:51:51.620 --> 02:51:53.620]  Well that's amazing and I'm not familiar with this group
[02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:55.620]  And guys put it back on the screen
[02:51:55.620 --> 02:51:57.620]  I'm not familiar with this group
[02:51:57.620 --> 02:51:59.620]  But a couple of the crew members apparently are
[02:51:59.620 --> 02:52:01.620]  Doing great work
[02:52:01.620 --> 02:52:03.620]  So they're familiar with the Westin A Price Foundation
[02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:05.620]  Wise traditions
[02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:07.620]  And food farming
[02:52:07.620 --> 02:52:09.620]  And the healing arts
[02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:11.620]  And you know this is what it's going to be
[02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:13.620]  This is going to be the solution
[02:52:13.620 --> 02:52:15.620]  We've got to get back to the land
[02:52:15.620 --> 02:52:17.620]  We've got to get back to God
[02:52:17.620 --> 02:52:19.620]  We've got to get back to humanity
[02:52:19.620 --> 02:52:21.620]  And that's why the establishment
[02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:23.620]  The Satanist establishment is trying to take us off all of that
[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:25.620]  And make us dependent on their
[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:27.620]  Infrastructure
[02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:29.620]  And make us available just with the earth
[02:52:29.620 --> 02:52:31.620]  Sam I've got to jump
[02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:33.620]  I've got other callers to get to
[02:52:33.620 --> 02:52:35.620]  Great call
[02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:37.620]  Let's go to Michael in Texas
[02:52:37.620 --> 02:52:39.620]  Michael you're on the air go ahead
[02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:41.620]  Hello?
[02:52:41.620 --> 02:52:43.620]  Yes hi
[02:52:43.620 --> 02:52:45.620]  Hey Owen how are you?
[02:52:45.620 --> 02:52:47.620]  Good
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:49.620]  Fighting the fight brother
[02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:51.620]  Appreciate you
[02:52:51.620 --> 02:52:53.620]  Thank you
[02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:55.620]  Everything with you Alex
[02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:57.620]  People out with just some information
[02:52:57.620 --> 02:52:59.620]  On survival and getting ready
[02:52:59.620 --> 02:53:01.620]  For you know the inevitable
[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:03.620]  People need to start
[02:53:03.620 --> 02:53:05.620]  Practicing
[02:53:05.620 --> 02:53:07.620]  Camping and just being without
[02:53:07.620 --> 02:53:09.620]  You know the
[02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:11.620]  The how do you say
[02:53:11.620 --> 02:53:13.620]  The trappings of modern
[02:53:13.620 --> 02:53:15.620]  Day society you know just
[02:53:15.620 --> 02:53:17.620]  Get used to it
[02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:19.620]  The more you practice the better you get
[02:53:19.620 --> 02:53:21.620]  The better you'll be prepared for
[02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:23.620]  Hopefully it never happens
[02:53:23.620 --> 02:53:25.620]  But what very well might happen
[02:53:25.620 --> 02:53:27.620]  And
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:29.620]  You know along with
[02:53:29.620 --> 02:53:31.620]  Camping and stuff
[02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:33.620]  I did want to
[02:53:33.620 --> 02:53:35.620]  Mention to you guys that
[02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:37.620]  I created a
[02:53:37.620 --> 02:53:39.620]  Specific item
[02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:41.620]  I want to see if I can get sponsored
[02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:43.620]  With you guys
[02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:45.620]  I don't want a free plug
[02:53:45.620 --> 02:53:47.620]  I just want to see if I can get in touch
[02:53:47.620 --> 02:53:49.620]  With somebody and pitch this idea
[02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:51.620]  To Alex and whoever does
[02:53:51.620 --> 02:53:53.620]  The promotions and stuff
[02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:55.620]  And see if I can help
[02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:57.620]  Y'all
[02:53:57.620 --> 02:53:59.620]  And so this is obviously
[02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:01.620]  Well let's just get your information
[02:54:01.620 --> 02:54:03.620]  Off there
[02:54:03.620 --> 02:54:05.620]  I'm not the one to talk to about that
[02:54:05.620 --> 02:54:07.620]  But we get your
[02:54:07.620 --> 02:54:09.620]  Information off there and they can
[02:54:09.620 --> 02:54:11.620]  Get you in touch with the individual
[02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:13.620]  To talk to about that but you know
[02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:15.620]  Michael brings up something and I'll take
[02:54:15.620 --> 02:54:17.620]  One more call here before we hand it over
[02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:19.620]  To Maria Z and Mike Adams
[02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:21.620]  Alex
[02:54:21.620 --> 02:54:23.620]  Like I said
[02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:25.620]  My top commitment is
[02:54:25.620 --> 02:54:27.620]  Doing what I do here
[02:54:27.620 --> 02:54:29.620]  And coming on every day
[02:54:29.620 --> 02:54:31.620]  And telling you the truth six days a week
[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:33.620]  Cruise up your seven days a week
[02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:35.620]  Alex Jones sometimes seven days a week
[02:54:35.620 --> 02:54:37.620]  And so
[02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:39.620]  It's not to be hypocritical
[02:54:39.620 --> 02:54:41.620]  But believe me
[02:54:41.620 --> 02:54:43.620]  And Alex has said this many times over the years
[02:54:43.620 --> 02:54:45.620]  I'd be lying if I said
[02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:47.620]  I didn't think about selling off
[02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:49.620]  Assets, liquefying everything
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:51.620]  And just dirting myself for total
[02:54:51.620 --> 02:54:53.620]  Collapse. I'd be lying
[02:54:53.620 --> 02:54:55.620]  If I told you I didn't think about that
[02:54:55.620 --> 02:54:57.620]  But I'd have to abandon this
[02:54:57.620 --> 02:54:59.620]  I'd have to never go on air completely abandon
[02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:01.620]  All this stuff and I'm not going to do this
[02:55:01.620 --> 02:55:03.620]  This is going to be my first priority, second priority, third priority
[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:05.620]  It's a calling from God
[02:55:05.620 --> 02:55:07.620]  It feels right, this is the most important
[02:55:07.620 --> 02:55:09.620]  Thing to do
[02:55:09.620 --> 02:55:11.620]  But I'm just telling you
[02:55:11.620 --> 02:55:13.620]  Like this is what's going through
[02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:15.620]  My head
[02:55:15.620 --> 02:55:17.620]  Like yeah, you know what
[02:55:17.620 --> 02:55:19.620]  We could shut the whole thing down
[02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:21.620]  I could liquefy assets, go out in the country
[02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:23.620]  And just get ready for the collapse
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:25.620]  But it's more important to have other people
[02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:27.620]  Prepared, it's more important to be here telling the truth every day
[02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:29.620]  And then just taking whatever practical measures I can
[02:55:29.620 --> 02:55:31.620]  Like it's just
[02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:33.620]  I don't want to go off too much on a
[02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:35.620]  Jag here, you get the point
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:37.620]  But
[02:55:37.620 --> 02:55:39.620]  It's funny people asking me stuff
[02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:41.620]  Making requests to hey do this, hey do that
[02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:43.620]  And it's like
[02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:45.620]  I'm going to probably be on air for 10 hours today
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:47.620]  So
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:49.620]  I don't really have time
[02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:51.620]  To do this other stuff that I probably
[02:55:51.620 --> 02:55:53.620]  Should be doing
[02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:55.620]  And other people are like hey I'm trying to help you
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:57.620]  Get in a better place, like yeah I know
[02:55:57.620 --> 02:55:59.620]  I appreciate you man, I'm on air 10 hours today
[02:55:59.620 --> 02:56:01.620]  Like
[02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:03.620]  You know
[02:56:03.620 --> 02:56:05.620]  I can't call my tax attorney
[02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:07.620]  I can't call potential business
[02:56:07.620 --> 02:56:09.620]  Relationships, I can't talk to this guy about
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:11.620]  Bringing a product on
[02:56:11.620 --> 02:56:13.620]  I need to stop right there, final caller
[02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:15.620]  John in Miami, go ahead
[02:56:19.620 --> 02:56:21.620]  Go ahead John, I'm sorry we just got you on
[02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:23.620]  Okay, can you hear me?
[02:56:23.620 --> 02:56:25.620]  Yep
[02:56:25.620 --> 02:56:27.620]  Alright, so I've been doing like some volunteer work
[02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:29.620]  For the local government
[02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:31.620]  District 2
[02:56:31.620 --> 02:56:33.620]  Campaigns, and what I found out
[02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:35.620]  Is we got three racketeers
[02:56:35.620 --> 02:56:37.620]  In our local government, number one is our mayor
[02:56:37.620 --> 02:56:39.620]  Suarez, he's famous now
[02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:41.620]  He was over there licking boots
[02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:43.620]  Of Carl Schwab in Davos
[02:56:43.620 --> 02:56:45.620]  He's the first racketeer
[02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:47.620]  The second one is Joe Corroyo
[02:56:47.620 --> 02:56:49.620]  Who's been here since the 90s
[02:56:49.620 --> 02:56:51.620]  And the third one is some Alex De La Portilla guy
[02:56:51.620 --> 02:56:53.620]  These guys are all registered
[02:56:53.620 --> 02:56:55.620]  As Republicans and they are not
[02:56:55.620 --> 02:56:57.620]  They are taking orders from a Democrat
[02:56:57.620 --> 02:56:59.620]  Lobbyist named Mark Sardo
[02:56:59.620 --> 02:57:01.620]  This guy is screwed up
[02:57:01.620 --> 02:57:03.620]  District 2
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:05.620]  And in District 2 it's the epicenter
[02:57:05.620 --> 02:57:07.620]  Of the FDX scam
[02:57:07.620 --> 02:57:09.620]  In Miami Heat is named
[02:57:09.620 --> 02:57:11.620]  The arena
[02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:13.620]  And they keep trying to tell me
[02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:15.620]  Oh no, that's just a sponsor
[02:57:15.620 --> 02:57:17.620]  They don't do anything, but it's all garbage
[02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:19.620]  Our entire District 2
[02:57:19.620 --> 02:57:21.620]  Is FDX money
[02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:23.620]  You know that's interesting John
[02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:25.620]  I'm out of time, that is interesting
[02:57:25.620 --> 02:57:27.620]  A couple interesting things happening in Florida
[02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:29.620]  Not just the FDX thing
[02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:31.620]  But clearing out voter rolls
[02:57:31.620 --> 02:57:33.620]  And maybe do they get legitimate elections there
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:35.620]  And that's why Republicans did so well
[02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:37.620]  But I digress, I'll be back coasting
[02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:39.620]  The War Room, big guests, big content
[02:57:39.620 --> 02:57:41.620]  Right now it's Maria Z and Mike Adams

[03:00:01.620 --> 03:00:03.620]  Down under
[03:00:03.620 --> 03:00:05.620]  I just want to, before we bring
[03:00:05.620 --> 03:00:07.620]  Mike Adams on today
[03:00:07.620 --> 03:00:09.620]  He'll be joining us
[03:00:09.620 --> 03:00:11.620]  He's an amazing guy
[03:00:11.620 --> 03:00:13.620]  And I'm going to get his insight
[03:00:13.620 --> 03:00:15.620]  On what's happening with the cyber attacks
[03:00:15.620 --> 03:00:17.620]  And global blackouts
[03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:19.620]  That are calming our way
[03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:21.620]  Crucial information that everyone needs
[03:00:21.620 --> 03:00:23.620]  To prepare for
[03:00:23.620 --> 03:00:25.620]  I just want to say
[03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:27.620]  I want Troy to just mention
[03:00:27.620 --> 03:00:29.620]  He's going to be broadcasting for 10 hours today
[03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:33.620]  Whatever industry you work in
[03:00:33.620 --> 03:00:35.620]  You always look to the best
[03:00:35.620 --> 03:00:37.620]  As a benchmark of how
[03:00:37.620 --> 03:00:39.620]  You want to be and how you want to operate
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:41.620]  And can I say working in media
[03:00:41.620 --> 03:00:43.620]  And a lot of people may not understand
[03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:45.620]  What goes on behind the scenes
[03:00:45.620 --> 03:00:47.620]  Info wars are some of the hardest working
[03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:49.620]  Most efficient people
[03:00:49.620 --> 03:00:51.620]  That I have dealt with in this industry
[03:00:51.620 --> 03:00:53.620]  They are amazing
[03:00:53.620 --> 03:00:55.620]  And the whole crew
[03:00:55.620 --> 03:00:57.620]  And all of the effort that goes behind
[03:00:57.620 --> 03:00:59.620]  Bringing this crucial information to the world
[03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:01.620]  Is just amazing to see
[03:01:01.620 --> 03:01:03.620]  And the dedication of people like Owen
[03:01:03.620 --> 03:01:05.620]  Is second to none
[03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:07.620]  So I just want to mention how grateful I am
[03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:09.620]  For this broadcast
[03:01:09.620 --> 03:01:11.620]  And for all of the independent media out there
[03:01:11.620 --> 03:01:13.620]  That's doing their best to bring out the truth
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:15.620]  To the world in the face of so much
[03:01:15.620 --> 03:01:17.620]  Adversity
[03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:19.620]  Today we're going to be joined by Mike Adams
[03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:21.620]  Live
[03:01:21.620 --> 03:01:23.620]  Mike, how are you today?
[03:01:23.620 --> 03:01:25.620]  Hello Maria, I'm doing great
[03:01:25.620 --> 03:01:27.620]  Thank you for having me on
[03:01:27.620 --> 03:01:29.620]  And I really appreciate your work
[03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:31.620]  And your contributions to this industry as well
[03:01:31.620 --> 03:01:33.620]  You're doing fantastic work
[03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:35.620]  And Owen Schreuer as you mentioned
[03:01:35.620 --> 03:01:37.620]  His work ethic is just
[03:01:37.620 --> 03:01:39.620]  Nobody can even touch it
[03:01:39.620 --> 03:01:41.620]  He's the hardest working young guy I know
[03:01:41.620 --> 03:01:43.620]  In this industry, but we all work hard
[03:01:43.620 --> 03:01:45.620]  You're self included, myself included
[03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:47.620]  I'm actually working on my new studio
[03:01:47.620 --> 03:01:49.620]  For all kinds of little glitches
[03:01:49.620 --> 03:01:51.620]  And bugs and things we're trying to work out
[03:01:51.620 --> 03:01:53.620]  It's all this behind the scenes stuff
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:55.620]  That a lot of people don't see
[03:01:55.620 --> 03:01:57.620]  But it's necessary to get the message out
[03:01:57.620 --> 03:01:59.620]  Yes, absolutely
[03:01:59.620 --> 03:02:01.620]  Same to you Mike, so much respect
[03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:03.620]  And appreciation for what you do
[03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:05.620]  Now I want to, today I really want to focus
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:07.620]  On these blackouts
[03:02:07.620 --> 03:02:09.620]  And I know that you recently did a situation update
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:11.620]  Where you spoke about after the EMP
[03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:13.620]  We also got a really great update
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:15.620]  On Rudy on that broadcast
[03:02:15.620 --> 03:02:17.620]  Please do listen
[03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:19.620]  It's really delightful to listen to
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:21.620]  But these blackouts that are happening
[03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:23.620]  All over the world cyberattacks
[03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:25.620]  Greg Rees recently did a video
[03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:27.620]  On this incoming cyberattack
[03:02:27.620 --> 03:02:29.620]  For a new world order
[03:02:29.620 --> 03:02:31.620]  Now Italy, just the other day
[03:02:31.620 --> 03:02:33.620]  Huge cyberattack, they're meeting now
[03:02:33.620 --> 03:02:35.620]  With global leaders
[03:02:35.620 --> 03:02:37.620]  To talk about how to prepare against this
[03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:39.620]  I want to go through a really quick timeline
[03:02:39.620 --> 03:02:41.620]  Mike, just before the break
[03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:43.620]  And then I want to get your insight
[03:02:43.620 --> 03:02:45.620]  I've got, and this is by in no way
[03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:47.620]  Shape or form an exhaustive list
[03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:49.620]  But listen to this, 28th of December
[03:02:49.620 --> 03:02:51.620]  Without providing any evidence
[03:02:51.620 --> 03:02:53.620]  The Austrian defence minister, Claudia Tana
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:55.620]  Alleged that Russia was planning
[03:02:55.620 --> 03:02:57.620]  Major cyberattacks on Europe's
[03:02:57.620 --> 03:02:59.620]  Power systems, causing widespread
[03:02:59.620 --> 03:03:01.620]  Power outages across all of Europe
[03:03:01.620 --> 03:03:03.620]  Over the coming months
[03:03:03.620 --> 03:03:05.620]  Paris, which is the footage that the team
[03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:07.620]  Just played before, over 100,000 homes
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:09.620]  Were affected, this was on the 9th of December
[03:03:09.620 --> 03:03:11.620]  In Australia on the 9th of December
[03:03:11.620 --> 03:03:13.620]  Millions of customers were unable to
[03:03:13.620 --> 03:03:15.620]  Use their health insurance
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:17.620]  With medibank set to shut down its systems
[03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:19.620]  In the wake of a huge cyberattack
[03:03:19.620 --> 03:03:21.620]  6th of December, Reuters
[03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:23.620]  Warned of widespread blackouts
[03:03:23.620 --> 03:03:25.620]  November the 20th, last year
[03:03:25.620 --> 03:03:27.620]  Head of the federal office for civil protection
[03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:29.620]  And disaster assistance told Germans
[03:03:29.620 --> 03:03:31.620]  We have to assume that there will be
[03:03:31.620 --> 03:03:33.620]  Blackouts this winter
[03:03:33.620 --> 03:03:35.620]  4th of November, the UK was testing
[03:03:35.620 --> 03:03:37.620]  The emergency blackout plan
[03:03:37.620 --> 03:03:39.620]  As reported by the Guardian
[03:03:39.620 --> 03:03:41.620]  In October, the BBC
[03:03:41.620 --> 03:03:43.620]  Prepared scripts, just like they did
[03:03:43.620 --> 03:03:45.620]  With event 201, Mike, and I'm going to
[03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:47.620]  Let you take over right after the break
[03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:49.620]  But this is important for people to know
[03:03:49.620 --> 03:03:51.620]  The BBC prepared scripts like they did
[03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:53.620]  For possible winter blackouts
[03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:55.620]  On the 5th of October, Bangladesh
[03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:57.620]  Power grid collapsed, causing a
[03:03:57.620 --> 03:03:59.620]  Blackout for more than 140
[03:03:59.620 --> 03:04:01.620]  Million citizens
[03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:03.620]  24th of September, Bloomberg reported
[03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:05.620]  The Estonian Prime Minister
[03:04:05.620 --> 03:04:07.620]  Warned that Russia could be preparing
[03:04:07.620 --> 03:04:09.620]  To disconnect Russia
[03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:11.620]  The three Baltic countries
[03:04:11.620 --> 03:04:13.620]  From their electricity grid
[03:04:13.620 --> 03:04:15.620]  Leading to widespread blackouts
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:17.620]  And in January of last year
[03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:19.620]  Kazakhstan was in the midst of a
[03:04:19.620 --> 03:04:21.620]  Nation-scale internet blackout after public unrest
[03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:23.620]  Here's my theory, Mike
[03:04:23.620 --> 03:04:25.620]  The final drawcard
[03:04:25.620 --> 03:04:27.620]  Has always been a global
[03:04:27.620 --> 03:04:29.620]  Shutdown of all our infrastructure
[03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:31.620]  All our resources
[03:04:31.620 --> 03:04:33.620]  And it would come
[03:04:33.620 --> 03:04:35.620]  Probably in the form of an EMP attack
[03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:37.620]  Which you just reported on
[03:04:37.620 --> 03:04:39.620]  Right after the break, we're going to get
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:41.620]  Mike's analysis on all of this
[03:04:41.620 --> 03:04:43.620]  This is something every single person
[03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:45.620]  Needs to be prepared for, and as I said
[03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:47.620]  This is in no way shape or form an exhaustive list
[03:04:47.620 --> 03:04:49.620]  This is just the few things that I've covered
[03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:51.620]  Save with us, right after the break
[03:04:51.620 --> 03:04:53.620]  With Mike Adams, what do we do
[03:04:53.620 --> 03:04:55.620]  With the coming EMP attack?
[03:04:57.620 --> 03:04:59.620]  The Second American Revolution
[03:04:59.620 --> 03:05:01.620]  Is happening right now against the New World Order
[03:05:01.620 --> 03:05:03.620]  And the answer to their
[03:05:03.620 --> 03:05:05.620]  1984 tyranny is the
[03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:07.620]  1776 mindset
[03:05:07.620 --> 03:05:09.620]  And Info Wars embodies
[03:05:09.620 --> 03:05:11.620]  That fight for human liberty against
[03:05:11.620 --> 03:05:13.620]  Globalist tyranny. Now in the last year
[03:05:13.620 --> 03:05:15.620]  We've done a very successful fundraiser
[03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:17.620]  Of silver coins
[03:05:17.620 --> 03:05:19.620]  When you buy the coin, you know that
[03:05:19.620 --> 03:05:21.620]  You are supporting the transmission
[03:05:21.620 --> 03:05:23.620]  And you get a historical momento
[03:05:23.620 --> 03:05:25.620]  So you can remember the great contribution
[03:05:25.620 --> 03:05:27.620]  You make to freedom. Now
[03:05:27.620 --> 03:05:29.620]  Despite the fact that the coins are selling out
[03:05:29.620 --> 03:05:31.620]  The last of the four coin series
[03:05:31.620 --> 03:05:33.620]  The Roosevelt man the arena
[03:05:33.620 --> 03:05:35.620]  We're offering it for $30 off right now
[03:05:35.620 --> 03:05:37.620]  All supplies last
[03:05:37.620 --> 03:05:39.620]  At 1776coin.com
[03:05:39.620 --> 03:05:41.620]  And just like an NPR pledge drive
[03:05:41.620 --> 03:05:43.620]  Where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt
[03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:45.620]  Or a DVD, 300%
[03:05:45.620 --> 03:05:47.620]  That's what we've done with this
[03:05:47.620 --> 03:05:49.620]  Because it's a fundraiser. But despite that
[03:05:49.620 --> 03:05:51.620]  We're offering $30 off exclusively
[03:05:51.620 --> 03:05:53.620]  At 1776
[03:05:53.620 --> 03:05:55.620]  On what coins remain. Please go to
[03:05:55.620 --> 03:06:03.620]  1776coin.com right now.
[03:06:03.620 --> 03:06:05.620]  We're here with Mike Adams for his analysis
[03:06:05.620 --> 03:06:07.620]  On the EMP
[03:06:07.620 --> 03:06:09.620]  We just had the so called spy balloon
[03:06:09.620 --> 03:06:11.620]  Over the United States
[03:06:11.620 --> 03:06:13.620]  And I really think Mike
[03:06:13.620 --> 03:06:15.620]  That they are preparing us for
[03:06:15.620 --> 03:06:17.620]  Global cyber shutdown
[03:06:17.620 --> 03:06:19.620]  What are your thoughts?
[03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:21.620]  In order to understand
[03:06:21.620 --> 03:06:23.620]  Why these balloons are really EMP weapons
[03:06:23.620 --> 03:06:25.620]  Platforms that are designed to take out the power grid
[03:06:25.620 --> 03:06:27.620]  Across most of the continental United States
[03:06:27.620 --> 03:06:29.620]  You've got to understand that
[03:06:29.620 --> 03:06:31.620]  China has been planning
[03:06:31.620 --> 03:06:33.620]  A land invasion of North America
[03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:35.620]  For many years. They intend
[03:06:35.620 --> 03:06:37.620]  To carry it out. We don't know when exactly
[03:06:37.620 --> 03:06:39.620]  But I've
[03:06:39.620 --> 03:06:41.620]  Spoken with many experts on this
[03:06:41.620 --> 03:06:43.620]  I know you have to including JR Nyquist
[03:06:43.620 --> 03:06:45.620]  For example. And we know that China
[03:06:45.620 --> 03:06:47.620]  Has been pre-staging equipment
[03:06:47.620 --> 03:06:49.620]  And personnel in the United States
[03:06:49.620 --> 03:06:51.620]  They have infiltrated virtually every institution
[03:06:51.620 --> 03:06:53.620]  They have staged police uniforms
[03:06:53.620 --> 03:06:55.620]  Fully automatic weapons
[03:06:55.620 --> 03:06:57.620]  Portable artillery
[03:06:57.620 --> 03:06:59.620]  Units, mortars
[03:06:59.620 --> 03:07:01.620]  Ground to air missile systems that have been smuggled
[03:07:01.620 --> 03:07:03.620]  Across the open southern border
[03:07:03.620 --> 03:07:05.620]  This is all staged in the United States
[03:07:05.620 --> 03:07:07.620]  In preparation for
[03:07:07.620 --> 03:07:09.620]  An invasion by China
[03:07:09.620 --> 03:07:11.620]  Now this invasion could still be halted
[03:07:11.620 --> 03:07:13.620]  I think if Trump were in the White House
[03:07:13.620 --> 03:07:15.620]  He would put China in its place
[03:07:15.620 --> 03:07:17.620]  But because
[03:07:17.620 --> 03:07:19.620]  The current occupants of the White House
[03:07:19.620 --> 03:07:21.620]  Or you could at least say they are influenced
[03:07:21.620 --> 03:07:23.620]  Or blackmailed by China
[03:07:23.620 --> 03:07:25.620]  We are in a very hopeless situation
[03:07:25.620 --> 03:07:27.620]  We saw with the balloon
[03:07:27.620 --> 03:07:29.620]  That our military under the orders
[03:07:29.620 --> 03:07:31.620]  Of this woke Pentagon
[03:07:31.620 --> 03:07:33.620]  And I think a failing administration
[03:07:33.620 --> 03:07:35.620]  Will not stop an invasion of our airspace
[03:07:35.620 --> 03:07:37.620]  With EMP weapons platforms
[03:07:37.620 --> 03:07:39.620]  But here's how this is going to go
[03:07:39.620 --> 03:07:41.620]  Maria, if we get to this point
[03:07:41.620 --> 03:07:43.620]  It's not 100%
[03:07:43.620 --> 03:07:45.620]  But they would use the EMPs
[03:07:45.620 --> 03:07:47.620]  To soften us up
[03:07:47.620 --> 03:07:49.620]  Our power grid caused mass
[03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:51.620]  Social chaos
[03:07:51.620 --> 03:07:53.620]  Total violation of the rule of law
[03:07:53.620 --> 03:07:55.620]  In every major city
[03:07:55.620 --> 03:07:57.620]  Just chaos, starvation
[03:07:57.620 --> 03:07:59.620]  No water systems, nothing
[03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:01.620]  And then after a few weeks of that
[03:08:01.620 --> 03:08:03.620]  That's when China would invade
[03:08:03.620 --> 03:08:05.620]  And they would meet relatively little resistance
[03:08:05.620 --> 03:08:07.620]  For key reasons
[03:08:07.620 --> 03:08:09.620]  One of those reasons is because
[03:08:09.620 --> 03:08:11.620]  Well, the United States has shipped
[03:08:11.620 --> 03:08:13.620]  Most of its military munitions to Ukraine
[03:08:13.620 --> 03:08:15.620]  So virtually all of the
[03:08:15.620 --> 03:08:17.620]  Artillery rounds, drones
[03:08:17.620 --> 03:08:19.620]  Artillery units, the 777s and so on
[03:08:19.620 --> 03:08:21.620]  Have been shipped to Ukraine
[03:08:21.620 --> 03:08:23.620]  So the US military has cleared out
[03:08:23.620 --> 03:08:25.620]  The continental United States
[03:08:25.620 --> 03:08:27.620]  Making it highly susceptible
[03:08:27.620 --> 03:08:29.620]  To an invasion
[03:08:29.620 --> 03:08:31.620]  We don't even have anti-tank weapons
[03:08:31.620 --> 03:08:33.620]  In America anymore
[03:08:33.620 --> 03:08:35.620]  All China has to do is just land
[03:08:35.620 --> 03:08:37.620]  On California beaches
[03:08:37.620 --> 03:08:39.620]  Governor Newsom will probably give them a high five
[03:08:39.620 --> 03:08:41.620]  They've already banned AR-15s in California
[03:08:41.620 --> 03:08:43.620]  There won't be much guerrilla resistance
[03:08:43.620 --> 03:08:45.620]  In California
[03:08:45.620 --> 03:08:47.620]  And by the way, the Navy will probably be ordered
[03:08:47.620 --> 03:08:49.620]  To stand down by the woke Pentagon
[03:08:49.620 --> 03:08:51.620]  That I believe is working with China
[03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:53.620]  So we can go into all these details
[03:08:53.620 --> 03:08:55.620]  Even more, but that's kind of the big picture, Maria
[03:08:55.620 --> 03:08:57.620]  Yes, I agree with you
[03:08:57.620 --> 03:08:59.620]  And here's the thing, it's such a multi-pronged attack
[03:08:59.620 --> 03:09:01.620]  Because a lot of these things are blamed
[03:09:01.620 --> 03:09:03.620]  On Russia setting the world up
[03:09:03.620 --> 03:09:05.620]  You mentioned Jeff Nyquist
[03:09:05.620 --> 03:09:07.620]  I had the same intel last year
[03:09:07.620 --> 03:09:09.620]  And we had that audio
[03:09:09.620 --> 03:09:11.620]  That was leaked from
[03:09:11.620 --> 03:09:13.620]  The PLA
[03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:15.620]  And my intel sources say
[03:09:15.620 --> 03:09:17.620]  That people lost their lives
[03:09:17.620 --> 03:09:19.620]  In order to bring that audio out
[03:09:19.620 --> 03:09:21.620]  In fact, the people that leaked it
[03:09:21.620 --> 03:09:23.620]  They've been missing for some time
[03:09:23.620 --> 03:09:25.620]  I don't think that they've been found
[03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:27.620]  So that audio was
[03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:29.620]  As confirmed by several sources
[03:09:29.620 --> 03:09:31.620]  Authentic audio and there was a planned invasion
[03:09:31.620 --> 03:09:33.620]  At the time
[03:09:33.620 --> 03:09:35.620]  Now, did we thwart that invasion
[03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:37.620]  Because we brought that out? Probably, Mike
[03:09:37.620 --> 03:09:39.620]  Just like with anything that whistleblowers bring out
[03:09:39.620 --> 03:09:41.620]  But the
[03:09:41.620 --> 03:09:43.620]  The planned invasion is definitely there
[03:09:43.620 --> 03:09:45.620]  The ultimate goal is
[03:09:45.620 --> 03:09:47.620]  To destroy the United States
[03:09:47.620 --> 03:09:49.620]  As the world's superpower, which is why
[03:09:49.620 --> 03:09:51.620]  Even though I'm an Aussie, I am passionate
[03:09:51.620 --> 03:09:53.620]  About news coming out of the United States
[03:09:53.620 --> 03:09:55.620]  Because this is
[03:09:55.620 --> 03:09:57.620]  A huge, huge part of the
[03:09:57.620 --> 03:09:59.620]  New World Order takeover
[03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:01.620]  As soon as they collapse the United States, they're ready
[03:10:01.620 --> 03:10:03.620]  The US is holding the fort right now
[03:10:03.620 --> 03:10:05.620]  And this is why there's been
[03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:07.620]  Such a huge attack on the
[03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:09.620]  Morals
[03:10:09.620 --> 03:10:11.620]  The morale, sorry, of the United States
[03:10:11.620 --> 03:10:13.620]  And what a blow to the morale
[03:10:13.620 --> 03:10:15.620]  Seeing
[03:10:15.620 --> 03:10:17.620]  Biden and the US Air Force
[03:10:17.620 --> 03:10:19.620]  Not taking action on this
[03:10:19.620 --> 03:10:21.620]  Invading so-called spy balloon
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:23.620]  I mean, it's
[03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:25.620]  It is about demoralizing the American people
[03:10:27.620 --> 03:10:29.620]  Well, yes, absolutely
[03:10:29.620 --> 03:10:31.620]  And as you know, Australia
[03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:33.620]  Has been very heavily infiltrated
[03:10:33.620 --> 03:10:35.620]  By communist Chinese operatives as well
[03:10:35.620 --> 03:10:37.620]  Especially New South Wales
[03:10:37.620 --> 03:10:39.620]  And if the United States falls
[03:10:39.620 --> 03:10:41.620]  Then China will move on Australia
[03:10:41.620 --> 03:10:43.620]  Much like the Japanese were planning
[03:10:43.620 --> 03:10:45.620]  To do in World War II
[03:10:45.620 --> 03:10:47.620]  Right?
[03:10:47.620 --> 03:10:49.620]  I mean, if you tour the beaches
[03:10:49.620 --> 03:10:51.620]  Of Australia right now, there are still
[03:10:51.620 --> 03:10:53.620]  Old concrete bunkers with cannons
[03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:55.620]  In them, I've been to those beaches
[03:10:55.620 --> 03:10:57.620]  I've seen that defensive positions on the coastline
[03:10:57.620 --> 03:10:59.620]  Of Australia and a lot of people don't realize
[03:10:59.620 --> 03:11:01.620]  That, you know, Australia
[03:11:01.620 --> 03:11:03.620]  And New Zealand and the Philippines
[03:11:03.620 --> 03:11:05.620]  Are all right there within
[03:11:05.620 --> 03:11:07.620]  The range
[03:11:07.620 --> 03:11:09.620]  In Taiwan, of course, of what China wants to
[03:11:09.620 --> 03:11:11.620]  Claim as their domain
[03:11:11.620 --> 03:11:13.620]  And China is facing a collapse
[03:11:13.620 --> 03:11:15.620]  Unless they conquer
[03:11:15.620 --> 03:11:17.620]  This is critical to understand
[03:11:17.620 --> 03:11:19.620]  China needs more natural resources
[03:11:19.620 --> 03:11:21.620]  They need more room
[03:11:21.620 --> 03:11:23.620]  In order to increase their population
[03:11:23.620 --> 03:11:25.620]  They're suffering a demographic collapse right now
[03:11:25.620 --> 03:11:27.620]  And they need more food
[03:11:27.620 --> 03:11:29.620]  Because they can't grow enough food domestically
[03:11:29.620 --> 03:11:31.620]  So they value the
[03:11:31.620 --> 03:11:33.620]  The landscape of the United States for food production
[03:11:33.620 --> 03:11:35.620]  They value Australia
[03:11:35.620 --> 03:11:37.620]  The areas closer to the coastline
[03:11:37.620 --> 03:11:39.620]  Where there is food production
[03:11:39.620 --> 03:11:41.620]  But the rich mineral resources that are located
[03:11:41.620 --> 03:11:43.620]  More inland on the Australian continent
[03:11:43.620 --> 03:11:45.620]  Vast resources there
[03:11:45.620 --> 03:11:47.620]  As you know, just vast
[03:11:47.620 --> 03:11:49.620]  And largely untapped, by the way
[03:11:49.620 --> 03:11:51.620]  China wants all of that
[03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:53.620]  And China wants microchips out of Taiwan
[03:11:53.620 --> 03:11:55.620]  And they want the labor pool out of the Philippines
[03:11:55.620 --> 03:11:57.620]  So China has its sites
[03:11:57.620 --> 03:11:59.620]  Set on many, many countries
[03:11:59.620 --> 03:12:01.620]  How to take out the United States first, in their view
[03:12:01.620 --> 03:12:03.620]  If they're going to succeed in conquering those other
[03:12:03.620 --> 03:12:05.620]  Pacific remnations and continents
[03:12:05.620 --> 03:12:07.620]  So there you go
[03:12:07.620 --> 03:12:09.620]  China has a plan to become
[03:12:09.620 --> 03:12:11.620]  The world's superpower by 2050
[03:12:11.620 --> 03:12:13.620]  This is a public
[03:12:13.620 --> 03:12:15.620]  Knowledge they've even stated it
[03:12:15.620 --> 03:12:17.620]  So this is, we can absolutely
[03:12:17.620 --> 03:12:19.620]  See how they've been taking
[03:12:19.620 --> 03:12:21.620]  These steps over the years
[03:12:21.620 --> 03:12:23.620]  Australia, I think
[03:12:23.620 --> 03:12:25.620]  A huge part of our land
[03:12:25.620 --> 03:12:27.620]  Some of our roads are owned by China
[03:12:27.620 --> 03:12:29.620]  We even sold a body of water
[03:12:29.620 --> 03:12:31.620]  In the middle of the bushfires to China
[03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:33.620]  Mike, I mean, this is how insane
[03:12:33.620 --> 03:12:35.620]  This has gotten, you know
[03:12:35.620 --> 03:12:37.620]  It's crazy to see
[03:12:37.620 --> 03:12:39.620]  But I think this
[03:12:39.620 --> 03:12:41.620]  This talk of cyber attacks
[03:12:41.620 --> 03:12:43.620]  Is really huge
[03:12:43.620 --> 03:12:45.620]  So if the team can just
[03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:47.620]  Queue up that clip that I've got
[03:12:47.620 --> 03:12:49.620]  From the Davos this year
[03:12:49.620 --> 03:12:51.620]  Talking about cyber attacks
[03:12:51.620 --> 03:12:53.620]  Over the next two years
[03:12:53.620 --> 03:12:55.620]  We're here today
[03:12:55.620 --> 03:12:57.620]  To share the findings
[03:12:57.620 --> 03:12:59.620]  Of the World Economic Forum's
[03:12:59.620 --> 03:13:01.620]  Global Security Outlook
[03:13:01.620 --> 03:13:03.620]  Report 2023
[03:13:03.620 --> 03:13:05.620]  This is a result of research
[03:13:05.620 --> 03:13:07.620]  In collaboration with the forum's communities
[03:13:07.620 --> 03:13:09.620]  And our partner Accenture
[03:13:09.620 --> 03:13:11.620]  Which we've interviewed
[03:13:11.620 --> 03:13:13.620]  And sought input from over 300 executives globally
[03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:15.620]  The most striking finding
[03:13:15.620 --> 03:13:17.620]  That we found is that 93%
[03:13:17.620 --> 03:13:19.620]  Of cyber leaders
[03:13:19.620 --> 03:13:21.620]  And 86% of cyber
[03:13:21.620 --> 03:13:23.620]  Business leaders believe
[03:13:23.620 --> 03:13:25.620]  The geopolitical instability
[03:13:25.620 --> 03:13:27.620]  Makes a catastrophic
[03:13:27.620 --> 03:13:29.620]  Cyber event likely
[03:13:29.620 --> 03:13:31.620]  In the next two years
[03:13:33.620 --> 03:13:35.620]  A catastrophic cyber event
[03:13:35.620 --> 03:13:37.620]  Likely in the next two years
[03:13:37.620 --> 03:13:39.620]  Now, if everyone recalls
[03:13:39.620 --> 03:13:41.620]  I know that Info Wars has played
[03:13:41.620 --> 03:13:43.620]  The footage many, many times
[03:13:43.620 --> 03:13:45.620]  Maybe we'll play it a little bit later
[03:13:45.620 --> 03:13:47.620]  Because we've only got Mike for a short time today
[03:13:47.620 --> 03:13:49.620]  Before I'm going to take some calls
[03:13:49.620 --> 03:13:51.620]  The
[03:13:51.620 --> 03:13:53.620]  They've said will be much faster
[03:13:53.620 --> 03:13:55.620]  Much more widespread
[03:13:55.620 --> 03:13:57.620]  And more devastating than
[03:13:57.620 --> 03:13:59.620]  COVID-19
[03:13:59.620 --> 03:14:01.620]  And it would cause a global shutdown
[03:14:01.620 --> 03:14:03.620]  Of banks, phones, telecommunications
[03:14:03.620 --> 03:14:05.620]  Absolutely everything
[03:14:05.620 --> 03:14:07.620]  Including electricity
[03:14:07.620 --> 03:14:09.620]  With, get this, the only solution
[03:14:09.620 --> 03:14:11.620]  Is for people to get
[03:14:11.620 --> 03:14:13.620]  A digital vaccine to come back online
[03:14:13.620 --> 03:14:15.620]  We've got about a minute and a half
[03:14:15.620 --> 03:14:17.620]  Before the break, Mike, talk to us about
[03:14:17.620 --> 03:14:19.620]  The global shutdown
[03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:21.620]  Well, there are two sources
[03:14:21.620 --> 03:14:23.620]  Of the cyber attacks
[03:14:23.620 --> 03:14:25.620]  One are true strategic enemies
[03:14:25.620 --> 03:14:27.620]  Of the United States
[03:14:27.620 --> 03:14:29.620]  Such as China and North Korea
[03:14:29.620 --> 03:14:31.620]  And Russia right now
[03:14:31.620 --> 03:14:33.620]  But the other source is
[03:14:33.620 --> 03:14:35.620]  Our own government
[03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:37.620]  False flag cyber attacks
[03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:39.620]  In order to take down infrastructure
[03:14:39.620 --> 03:14:41.620]  That keeps civilization running
[03:14:41.620 --> 03:14:43.620]  You could even consider, by the way
[03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:45.620]  The shutting down of pipelines
[03:14:45.620 --> 03:14:47.620]  The shutting down of fossil fuels in Europe
[03:14:47.620 --> 03:14:49.620]  On infrastructure that's being carried out by governments
[03:14:49.620 --> 03:14:51.620]  The green agenda
[03:14:51.620 --> 03:14:53.620]  Has resulted in this energy scarcity
[03:14:53.620 --> 03:14:55.620]  That has caused deindustrialization
[03:14:55.620 --> 03:14:57.620]  Across Europe
[03:14:57.620 --> 03:14:59.620]  And the same thing is happening at a slower pace
[03:14:59.620 --> 03:15:01.620]  In the United States, at least as long as
[03:15:01.620 --> 03:15:03.620]  People like Joe Biden are in the White House
[03:15:03.620 --> 03:15:05.620]  Shutting down energy exploration and energy infrastructure
[03:15:05.620 --> 03:15:07.620]  So we, the people
[03:15:07.620 --> 03:15:09.620]  Are facing, in essence
[03:15:09.620 --> 03:15:11.620]  Two very severe threats
[03:15:11.620 --> 03:15:13.620]  Our own governments trying to shut down food
[03:15:13.620 --> 03:15:15.620]  Burning down food centers
[03:15:15.620 --> 03:15:17.620]  Shutting down infrastructure
[03:15:17.620 --> 03:15:19.620]  Shutting down indirectly railroads
[03:15:19.620 --> 03:15:21.620]  Transportation
[03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:23.620]  Diesel fuel, refineries and so on
[03:15:23.620 --> 03:15:25.620]  And then secondly enemies
[03:15:25.620 --> 03:15:27.620]  Who want to take us down for their own reasons
[03:15:27.620 --> 03:15:29.620]  So folks, you got to get prepared
[03:15:29.620 --> 03:15:31.620]  Because the world is going to become
[03:15:31.620 --> 03:15:33.620]  A lot less reliable throughout this year
[03:15:33.620 --> 03:15:35.620]  Even more so than you've seen already
[03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:38.620]  Absolutely great, Mike
[03:15:38.620 --> 03:15:39.620]  Right after the break
[03:15:39.620 --> 03:15:41.620]  We're going to talk about some of the ways that we can prepare
[03:15:41.620 --> 03:15:43.620]  And then we're going to actually take some callers
[03:15:43.620 --> 03:15:45.620]  After Mike leaves us
[03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:47.620]  How are people preparing around the world
[03:15:47.620 --> 03:15:49.620]  So that we can help one another
[03:15:49.620 --> 03:15:52.620]  Stay with us for this crucial, crucial information
[03:15:52.620 --> 03:15:54.620]  We'll be right back
[03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:00.620]  I have been in a 28 year
[03:16:00.620 --> 03:16:02.620]  Marathon battle with the globalist
[03:16:03.620 --> 03:16:05.620]  I have come from nowhere
[03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:07.620]  To the very heights of politics
[03:16:07.620 --> 03:16:09.620]  Not just in America, but the world
[03:16:09.620 --> 03:16:11.620]  We are engaging the globalist
[03:16:11.620 --> 03:16:14.620]  At point-blank range in the information war
[03:16:14.620 --> 03:16:16.620]  But I don't deserve the credit
[03:16:16.620 --> 03:16:17.620]  Yes, I've persevered
[03:16:17.620 --> 03:16:19.620]  But the listeners and viewers
[03:16:19.620 --> 03:16:21.620]  Who support them for the real reason
[03:16:21.620 --> 03:16:23.620]  You've had the success
[03:16:23.620 --> 03:16:25.620]  We're having now the greatest victories
[03:16:25.620 --> 03:16:27.620]  In the fight against the new order
[03:16:27.620 --> 03:16:28.620]  You've ever had
[03:16:28.620 --> 03:16:31.620]  We are now entering the final mile
[03:16:31.620 --> 03:16:33.620]  Of the marathon
[03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:35.620]  And that's why today
[03:16:35.620 --> 03:16:36.620]  It's more important than ever
[03:16:36.620 --> 03:16:38.620]  To realize how important you've been in this fight
[03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:40.620]  And to continue in the efforts
[03:16:40.620 --> 03:16:42.620]  You've been tearing out and to intensify them
[03:16:42.620 --> 03:16:43.620]  God bless you all
[03:16:43.620 --> 03:16:44.620]  I salute you
[03:16:44.620 --> 03:16:45.620]  I thank you
[03:16:45.620 --> 03:16:46.620]  And I beg you
[03:16:46.620 --> 03:16:48.620]  To intensify what you're doing now
[03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:50.620]  Because we are over the target
[03:16:50.620 --> 03:16:51.620]  And history is happening
[03:16:51.620 --> 03:16:53.620]  The fight is my fight
[03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:54.620]  It's your fight
[03:16:54.620 --> 03:16:55.620]  It's our fight
[03:16:55.620 --> 03:17:21.620]  And I beg you all

[03:19:44.620 --> 03:19:45.620]  Don't go anywhere
[03:19:45.620 --> 03:20:15.580]  And we are back with Mike Adams so we're talking about the
[03:20:15.580 --> 03:20:22.900]  imminent shutdown of electricity, telecommunications, so much more that people just simply are not
[03:20:22.900 --> 03:20:27.460]  prepared for. Mike, I know that this is something that you're very, very passionate about. Talk
[03:20:27.460 --> 03:20:35.180]  to us about what this will actually look like when this attack on our power grid comes and what
[03:20:35.180 --> 03:20:39.980]  people can do about it to prepare. Well, the first thing to realize is that, you know,
[03:20:39.980 --> 03:20:44.340]  there are three power grids in the continental United States, the eastern grid, the western grid,
[03:20:44.340 --> 03:20:49.060]  and then the Texas grid. And so it is quite possible that, for example, these balloons,
[03:20:49.060 --> 03:20:54.900]  if they detonate EMP weapons, you could lose the entire eastern grid, but the western grid
[03:20:54.900 --> 03:20:59.420]  could still function. The Texas grid might still function, and very likely to do so, in fact.
[03:20:59.420 --> 03:21:04.940]  Or perhaps the balloons could target the western grid, you see. So it may not be the entire country,
[03:21:04.940 --> 03:21:10.260]  and it may not last forever. You know, it might just be a few days, a few weeks,
[03:21:10.260 --> 03:21:16.860]  but if certain things happen past the tipping point, then it goes to years. So if the EMP
[03:21:16.860 --> 03:21:23.580]  weapons destroy enough of the power substations and certain components in the power grid that
[03:21:23.580 --> 03:21:28.780]  cannot be replaced without getting them made in China, you are likely to find yourself not
[03:21:28.780 --> 03:21:32.100]  able to source anything from China, because China has just declared war on you, so they're
[03:21:32.100 --> 03:21:38.500]  going to restrict exports. Thus, you will have no power in that scenario in certain cities for
[03:21:38.500 --> 03:21:44.900]  years to come, years. And that would mean that those cities collapse into Mad Max style, just
[03:21:44.900 --> 03:21:51.100]  complete dystopia, complete lawlessness, no services, no electricity, no 911, you know,
[03:21:51.100 --> 03:21:55.980]  even the police would pack up their bug out bags, grab their families and flee. So you would
[03:21:55.980 --> 03:22:01.300]  have mass migration out of the cities and into the rural areas across America, where, yeah,
[03:22:01.300 --> 03:22:06.180]  you may not have power in rural areas, but they aren't death traps without power. A lot of people
[03:22:06.180 --> 03:22:11.380]  can get by, it won't be easy, but you can still get by without power in a certain rural kind of
[03:22:11.380 --> 03:22:15.300]  environment. As long as you have a water source, a lot of people have backup, you know, solar
[03:22:15.300 --> 03:22:20.260]  panels, a lot of people have generators that may still function if they've stockpiled diesel fuel
[03:22:20.260 --> 03:22:26.340]  and things like that. So the government reports that we've seen over the last few years show that
[03:22:26.340 --> 03:22:32.540]  there's an estimated 70 to 90% of the US population would die within, I believe, about 18 months
[03:22:32.540 --> 03:22:39.980]  following a nationwide EMP attack. And those deaths are from starvation, violence, disease. You
[03:22:39.980 --> 03:22:45.660]  would have lots of cholera infections because you don't have working sewage systems. So every city
[03:22:45.660 --> 03:22:50.220]  would become like San Francisco, frankly, just completely filled with feces and filth, and they
[03:22:50.220 --> 03:22:55.260]  would be largely unsurvivable. And of course, violence and muggings and street battles with
[03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:59.660]  gangs and so on. So you got to get away from those cities if you want to survive this, that's for
[03:22:59.660 --> 03:23:04.700]  sure. I absolutely agree with you. And you got to get away from the cities anyway, because they're
[03:23:04.700 --> 03:23:12.300]  becoming digital prisons, where we're seeing the rise of the, you know, the smart city agenda just
[03:23:12.300 --> 03:23:17.100]  yesterday in my telegram for whoever's not in there, get in there because there's great information
[03:23:17.100 --> 03:23:23.340]  and a great bunch of people in Z-media, three E's, one word. In that channel, someone showed
[03:23:23.340 --> 03:23:31.420]  their child in school, very young child, was given a project over the next two terms to imagine a
[03:23:31.420 --> 03:23:37.100]  smart city and how we can make it more sustainable. And, you know, they've already rolled out the
[03:23:37.100 --> 03:23:42.700]  indoctrination to children in schools about this stuff. And we see the marketing all over the world
[03:23:42.700 --> 03:23:47.580]  about these smart cities. Our premier in New South Wales, Dominic Perotep, recently announced,
[03:23:47.580 --> 03:23:55.580]  you know, right at the time of the Queen's death, Mike, allegedly, that New South Wales,
[03:23:55.580 --> 03:24:01.660]  Sydney was going to be the first smart city, three cities in Australia, and it was going
[03:24:01.660 --> 03:24:06.940]  to be a model for the whole world. And they're splitting it into districts. They use the words
[03:24:06.940 --> 03:24:12.620]  districts in their plans. I've reported on this many times, even on this show. So, you know,
[03:24:12.620 --> 03:24:19.500]  talk to us about the dystopian vision that they're setting for these smart cities and why people
[03:24:19.500 --> 03:24:26.300]  should actually move rural and prepare now. Well, understand that, of course, the globalists are
[03:24:26.300 --> 03:24:32.940]  working on a depopulation effort. They are now in the elimination phase of humanity. And this is
[03:24:32.940 --> 03:24:38.780]  because, of course, of the rise of, you know, like chat, GPT, AI systems, and then robotic systems
[03:24:38.780 --> 03:24:43.660]  that can replace many humans once they are tied to cloud-based AI computing systems.
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:49.100]  So, humans, from the point of view of globalists, are obsolete. So, to get rid of those humans,
[03:24:49.100 --> 03:24:53.900]  the globalists need to corral them into controllable spaces. And that's where those districts come
[03:24:53.900 --> 03:24:57.660]  from that you talked about. And I know you've covered this extensively, but this has also been
[03:24:57.660 --> 03:25:02.460]  talked about in places like Scotland and so on, like 20-minute cities where you're not allowed to
[03:25:02.460 --> 03:25:06.620]  have a vehicle. You're only allowed to go to places that you can reach within 20 minutes of
[03:25:06.620 --> 03:25:12.300]  walking or perhaps having a bicycle. No vehicles for you. You can't get out. Kind of like a Truman
[03:25:12.300 --> 03:25:16.460]  show thing. If you try to cross the bridge, they'll turn you back, you know, with armed guards, you
[03:25:16.460 --> 03:25:21.340]  know, go back into your simulation, which is actually a kill zone. Now, it will be very difficult
[03:25:21.340 --> 03:25:26.380]  for governments of the world to round up rural people. The governments just don't have enough
[03:25:26.380 --> 03:25:32.540]  personnel. And a lot of rural people just simply will not cooperate. Most city people will cooperate,
[03:25:32.540 --> 03:25:36.860]  most of them, not all, but most of them will. They're the ones who tended to take the vaccines.
[03:25:36.860 --> 03:25:41.100]  They're the ones who are willing to join the mark of the beast, financial transaction system,
[03:25:41.100 --> 03:25:45.580]  digital currency. They'll be easy for globalists to control and exterminate. And that's what this
[03:25:45.580 --> 03:25:50.700]  is, mass extermination. And by the way, you know, a new study on the vaccine finds that
[03:25:51.420 --> 03:25:56.860]  the COVID vaccines cause hyper-accelerated aging. So, rapid aging also explains some
[03:25:56.860 --> 03:26:01.500]  of what's happening. It's why people are growing cancer at such an accelerated pace. And it's also
[03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:05.660]  why people, one of the reasons why people are dying from heart disease, even though they're
[03:26:05.660 --> 03:26:10.860]  so young, they're actually aging like they're in a time machine or something. It's crazy.
[03:26:10.860 --> 03:26:15.980]  But the die-off is the goal. And if you want to survive, you're going to have to get out of the
[03:26:15.980 --> 03:26:20.380]  cities and become self-reliant, which means growing your own food, having your own backup,
[03:26:20.380 --> 03:26:27.340]  everything, backup currency, backup self-defense, backup energy systems, you know, backup emergency
[03:26:27.340 --> 03:26:33.500]  medicine, all of it. And so that's my take on it, Maria. I agree with you, Mike. And I think that
[03:26:33.500 --> 03:26:37.740]  more and more people are starting to realize that we need, we're seeing the rise of parallel
[03:26:37.740 --> 03:26:42.540]  systems, for example, parallel health systems, doctors that aren't brainwashed and brain dead,
[03:26:42.540 --> 03:26:49.180]  essentially. I watched a podcast recently where there was a young pro-abortionist,
[03:26:49.180 --> 03:26:55.980]  pro-murder woman who's studying to be a doctor. And she said that, you know, she was posed with
[03:26:55.980 --> 03:27:01.100]  a question of ethics, Mike. And she said that she would have performed lobotomies in the end. She
[03:27:01.100 --> 03:27:07.180]  said, even though we know now that lobotomies were wrong, because it was the scientific consensus
[03:27:07.180 --> 03:27:12.540]  at the time, not even knowing what we know now, she would have performed the lobotomy. This is
[03:27:13.340 --> 03:27:19.660]  like they did in the 1800s. These are the types of doctors that we are seeing coming into the major,
[03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:26.220]  you know, the major medical system. We've got here in the state of Queensland, the largest
[03:27:26.220 --> 03:27:31.020]  intake of junior doctors that we have seen to date. They're doing the same with the police force.
[03:27:31.020 --> 03:27:36.860]  I'll be reporting on this a lot more soon. Or getting rid of the older officers, the more senior
[03:27:36.860 --> 03:27:41.660]  ones, the ones with experience and a conscience, and just bringing in the indoctrinated police
[03:27:41.660 --> 03:27:48.140]  officers. And I think this is a worldwide problem, Mike, as we see the New World Order goons that
[03:27:48.140 --> 03:27:53.100]  are serving the existing systems and making this takeover possible, rising up more and more.
[03:27:53.900 --> 03:27:59.500]  A few quick words before we finish up, Mike, and please follow Mike on naturalnews.com.
[03:27:59.980 --> 03:28:03.260]  And, you know, he's just constantly bringing crucial info.
[03:28:04.860 --> 03:28:09.020]  Well, thank you, Maria. Thank you for what you do and for hosting the show. You've done
[03:28:09.020 --> 03:28:13.020]  extraordinary work along with an amazing crew there. I would just say, look,
[03:28:13.020 --> 03:28:18.460]  we are about to witness the horrors that human beings are capable of performing against each
[03:28:18.460 --> 03:28:23.340]  other under false authority. It's going to be so much worse than the Holocaust. It's already,
[03:28:23.340 --> 03:28:27.580]  in many ways, worse than that in terms of the number of people killed globally by these vaccines.
[03:28:27.580 --> 03:28:31.420]  It's over 20 million and counting. And there may be billions dead through all of this
[03:28:31.420 --> 03:28:35.420]  over the next 10 years. So get prepared, folks. You're going to see the worst of humanity.
[03:28:35.420 --> 03:28:41.020]  But also, with God on our side, we can prevail. We can survive this. Thank you, Maria, for having
[03:28:41.020 --> 03:28:46.220]  me on. Thank you so much, Mike. Stay with us right on the other side of the break. We're going to

[03:31:01.820 --> 03:31:06.860]  the wellness company. And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company.
[03:31:06.860 --> 03:31:12.460]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors. Far and away, the most
[03:31:12.460 --> 03:31:19.260]  popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natokinase. It's a
[03:31:19.260 --> 03:31:25.820]  natural proteolytic enzyme. This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves
[03:31:25.820 --> 03:31:29.980]  the spike protein. This is very important. The spike protein is loaded in the body with the
[03:31:29.980 --> 03:31:34.620]  COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines. People are lower with the spike protein. I don't
[03:31:34.620 --> 03:31:40.380]  feel well. This is a potential solution. Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance. So does
[03:31:40.380 --> 03:31:46.780]  ivermectin and now natokinase. Isn't it interesting? Natural substances in a sense combating this
[03:31:46.780 --> 03:31:52.780]  man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines. Onlinehealthnow.com. Thank you for your support
[03:31:52.780 --> 03:31:55.900]  and thank you for getting into that because it's important. You didn't come here to do that, but
[03:31:55.900 --> 03:32:02.300]  I made you do it. I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody
[03:32:02.300 --> 03:32:08.380]  can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the
[03:32:08.380 --> 03:32:14.300]  crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been
[03:32:14.300 --> 03:32:19.500]  the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they
[03:32:19.500 --> 03:32:25.980]  engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself,
[03:32:25.980 --> 03:32:30.780]  the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that
[03:32:31.340 --> 03:32:36.220]  InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray
[03:32:36.220 --> 03:32:40.220]  for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to
[03:32:40.220 --> 03:32:44.700]  InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:32:44.700 --> 03:32:48.540]  All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than one percent of our listeners
[03:32:48.540 --> 03:32:53.020]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com. If just one percent more of you took action
[03:32:53.020 --> 03:32:56.860]  at InfoWarsStore.com, our fighting problems will be over. Please take action now.
[03:32:58.460 --> 03:33:04.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.460 --> 03:33:17.740]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. We're going to open up the phone lines. You can call 877
[03:33:17.740 --> 03:33:28.060]  789 2539. That's 877 789 2539. I really want to hear from people about how they are preparing
[03:33:28.060 --> 03:33:36.540]  them, their selves and their loved ones for incoming electricity shortages, blackouts,
[03:33:36.540 --> 03:33:43.900]  cyber attacks, telecommunications outages, because I don't have all the answers. Mike doesn't have
[03:33:43.900 --> 03:33:51.660]  all the answers as brilliant as he is. Oh, and Harrison, Alex, we are just people, like everyone
[03:33:51.660 --> 03:33:57.820]  else, trying to navigate based on the intel that we have, trying to navigate based on what we know
[03:33:57.820 --> 03:34:04.940]  the globalists are doing and help warn the world of what is ahead. We've got people dialing in right
[03:34:04.940 --> 03:34:11.900]  now. And as their names come up, I'll announce them and we'll bring them on. But I really depend
[03:34:11.900 --> 03:34:18.620]  and I love talking to people around the world. The Infowars audience is one of the brightest,
[03:34:18.620 --> 03:34:23.260]  sharpest audiences out there. And I have to say the same for the people that tune into my stuff
[03:34:23.260 --> 03:34:28.860]  in Telegram, really intelligent people that aren't going to be fooled by the lies of the
[03:34:28.860 --> 03:34:37.180]  mainstream media. They know they need to prepare. We've got Hamar, Hamahadi. Hamar, you're on the air.
[03:34:37.180 --> 03:34:45.500]  How's it going? Thanks for taking my call. It's good to talk to you, Hamar. So talk to us about
[03:34:45.500 --> 03:34:54.380]  how you're preparing for what is coming our way. Well, I mean, I think the EMP attacks are probably
[03:34:54.380 --> 03:34:58.380]  the most important thing that we need to protect ourselves from right now. So, I mean, I've already
[03:34:58.380 --> 03:35:04.940]  got some of the Infowars Faraday cages and some of the older ones and some of the newer ones. And
[03:35:04.940 --> 03:35:11.180]  recently, I looked up online and they actually, from what I understand, they make cloth that is
[03:35:12.220 --> 03:35:18.140]  meant for EMP protection. So you can get these large sections of cloth and actually drape them
[03:35:18.140 --> 03:35:23.660]  over your vehicle. So don't everybody rush out too quick and buy them because I get paid tomorrow
[03:35:23.660 --> 03:35:27.820]  and I need to buy mine. But that's what I'm planning on doing. I'm planning on buying some of these
[03:35:27.820 --> 03:35:33.340]  EMP proof blankets, basically. And I'm going to drape it over my truck. So at least I can have
[03:35:33.340 --> 03:35:39.580]  some four-wheel drive when things get bad. Well, that's great advice, Hamar. And for all the people
[03:35:39.580 --> 03:35:46.140]  that haven't converted to electric yet and hopefully this audience hasn't, what a death trap,
[03:35:46.140 --> 03:35:49.820]  getting an electric vehicle, knowing what these people are planning. Thank you so much for your
[03:35:49.820 --> 03:35:58.220]  advice, Hamar. We'll go to Andrew in New York. Infowars, it's definitely good to de-enterize
[03:35:58.220 --> 03:36:07.420]  this and to have golden silver in case they take the bail in with the bank.
[03:36:09.740 --> 03:36:22.940]  But I think it's also good to just have a supply chain working right. Use all the energies.
[03:36:22.940 --> 03:36:31.020]  Yes. Well, let me just say, Andrew, on the silver and gold, people always often ask me,
[03:36:31.020 --> 03:36:36.540]  you know, if the digital currency comes in and we don't have access to our bank accounts and we
[03:36:36.540 --> 03:36:42.220]  can't operate within the financial system because of CBDCs and digital IDs and so on and so forth,
[03:36:42.220 --> 03:36:46.780]  what good will silver or gold be for us? Venezuela is a perfect example where they're
[03:36:46.780 --> 03:36:52.140]  paying for haircuts with gold shavings when the cash became worthless on the streets.
[03:36:52.140 --> 03:36:56.380]  Silver and gold, precious metals are key. You know, you'll go down the road to a farmer
[03:36:56.380 --> 03:37:01.260]  that you should start building relationships with locally right now and you'll be able to trade in
[03:37:01.260 --> 03:37:05.260]  that currency. These are things that absolutely last. Thank you, Andrew, for your call. Really
[03:37:05.260 --> 03:37:11.020]  appreciate it. Sarah in Canada, you're on the air. Thank you so much for taking my call and a
[03:37:11.020 --> 03:37:19.660]  little bit off topic. I was listening to Owen this morning and it was on topic at the time,
[03:37:19.660 --> 03:37:25.900]  but I'm finally getting through. So thank you. I was thinking about there are two times in human
[03:37:25.900 --> 03:37:35.740]  history where God is what said, you know, with man and it was in the days of Noah in the flood,
[03:37:35.740 --> 03:37:43.340]  right? And then Sodom and Gomorrah and both times, if you read the scriptures properly,
[03:37:43.340 --> 03:37:51.420]  it was the human genome that was being tampered with. The first time was the Nephilim were having
[03:37:51.420 --> 03:37:55.900]  sex with the women and that's right in the Bible. And the second time was Sodom and Gomorrah where
[03:37:55.900 --> 03:38:02.700]  the angels were being, it wasn't just in like Noah was a drunk, okay? Or it wasn't a drunk,
[03:38:02.700 --> 03:38:07.900]  but he drank, okay? So I'm just saying it wasn't all about the sin. It was about their genome
[03:38:07.900 --> 03:38:16.060]  being tampered with and that's when God said no and we're here again. Yes. So Sarah, just on that
[03:38:16.060 --> 03:38:23.180]  there are archaeological findings from the time of Noah or thereabouts that have actually found
[03:38:23.180 --> 03:38:29.180]  that there was tampering with the human genome. It backs up what is in the Bible about that topic.
[03:38:29.180 --> 03:38:33.260]  So you're absolutely right and we're told that as it was in the days of Noah, so shall be before
[03:38:33.260 --> 03:38:39.020]  the coming of the Son of Man. So there is absolutely direct correlation between tampering with the
[03:38:39.020 --> 03:38:46.220]  human genome from those times and now and we can see that through the, you know, we know now about
[03:38:46.220 --> 03:38:52.940]  the reverse transcribing into the human DNA from the Lund University in Sweden. It's absolutely
[03:38:52.940 --> 03:38:59.020]  happening. CRISPR technology, you know, slicing out, replacing. It's shocking to witness and it's
[03:38:59.020 --> 03:39:05.020]  shocking to know that so much of humanity has been, you know, their original creation has been
[03:39:05.020 --> 03:39:10.540]  sliced out and replaced with what? Luciferase. I mean, you know, not Luciferase. This is one
[03:39:10.540 --> 03:39:14.380]  of the ingredients, but you understand what I'm saying. It's just sickening. So you're absolutely
[03:39:14.380 --> 03:39:19.180]  right, Sarah. Thank you for that call. And it's just another confirmation that we need to stay far
[03:39:19.180 --> 03:39:24.540]  away from all of these products, including mRNA in the meat supply, which is coming both to the
[03:39:24.540 --> 03:39:29.740]  United States and Australia. We have confirmation of that in Australia through a press release.
[03:39:29.740 --> 03:39:36.140]  By August of this year, they want to inject all mRNA, all livestock with mRNA. We're going to go
[03:39:36.140 --> 03:39:43.980]  to Jeff, sorry, Greg in Florida. Greg, you're on the air. Maria, very nice to be on your show.
[03:39:45.100 --> 03:39:50.780]  I enjoy watching it. Spent a lot of time in your wonderful country down there over the years.
[03:39:50.780 --> 03:39:58.140]  What I want to mention to you, I had a company, a laser technology company,
[03:39:58.780 --> 03:40:06.860]  oh, 25 years ago. My chief scientist was Allen Hill, who developed and directed Star Wars under
[03:40:06.860 --> 03:40:14.620]  the Reagan administration. So I learned quite a bit over the years with that company. As far as
[03:40:14.620 --> 03:40:23.820]  the EMP are concerned, they'll knock stuff out this now. But of course, it has been tested
[03:40:24.700 --> 03:40:33.660]  on a broad range that I know of. But there are some things that you can do to protect yourself,
[03:40:33.660 --> 03:40:38.940]  protect your house, your holdings, things like that. They have certain kinds of insulation
[03:40:38.940 --> 03:40:46.300]  you can put throughout your house and building. But yeah, so it is bad. And of course, you want
[03:40:46.300 --> 03:40:52.460]  to be prepared for the worst of the worst all the time. Better be prepared than play Monday
[03:40:52.460 --> 03:40:58.780]  catch up. So hopefully, it won't be as bad. But of course, it is good to be prepared.
[03:40:59.980 --> 03:41:04.300]  Well, here's what I always say, Greg. I prepare for the worst, hope, pray, fight peacefully for
[03:41:04.300 --> 03:41:09.740]  the best. I've recently interviewed Dr. Pete Chambers. That's now on the Zmedia tab on ban.info.
[03:41:09.740 --> 03:41:14.060]  If you haven't seen it yet, ban.video, sorry. If you haven't seen it yet, please do go and watch
[03:41:14.060 --> 03:41:18.780]  that interview. Lieutenant Colonel Chambers is a former Green Beret special flight surgeon.
[03:41:20.540 --> 03:41:26.620]  He's an amazing man. And he gave an informed consent briefing to 3,000 soldiers. And after he
[03:41:26.620 --> 03:41:30.860]  did that, only three or four of them, I think, went ahead with the injections. And it was
[03:41:30.860 --> 03:41:37.260]  subsequently relieved from his duties, you know, an almost 40 year veteran serving previously in
[03:41:37.260 --> 03:41:42.140]  the Green Berets. It's a fascinating story. But he talks about the fact that this is fifth generation
[03:41:42.140 --> 03:41:48.940]  warfare and we have to prepare for the absolute worst. That's what soldiers do. See, the sooner
[03:41:48.940 --> 03:41:56.540]  that we accept that we are at war because the globalist initiated that war and declared it
[03:41:56.540 --> 03:42:03.580]  on the people. And we understand the weapons of their warfare, which is censorship, misinformation
[03:42:03.580 --> 03:42:11.980]  on their part, poison through the pharmaceutical industry. Now we're facing electricity shutdown,
[03:42:11.980 --> 03:42:20.300]  cyber attacks, you know, telecommunications, blackouts, energy attack. Once we understand
[03:42:20.300 --> 03:42:25.260]  the potential attacks that are coming our way, we can actually prepare and fight against them.
[03:42:25.260 --> 03:42:31.340]  That's what good soldiers do while they plan their counter attacks or even their preemptive
[03:42:31.340 --> 03:42:35.340]  attacks. So this is what we have to prepare for. I'm going to give out the number one more time,
[03:42:35.340 --> 03:42:44.300]  877-789-2539. That's 877-789-2539. We'll be back on the other side of this break
[03:42:44.300 --> 03:42:49.820]  with more callers on how they are preparing in this war that we are in. Thank you so much,
[03:42:49.820 --> 03:42:55.740]  Greg, for calling. We really appreciate your time.

[03:44:07.260 --> 03:44:11.180]  we were going to be shut down. They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars. None of that's
[03:44:11.180 --> 03:44:16.620]  true. It's all being appealed. They want you to think Info Wars is dead, but if you simply stand

[03:46:41.020 --> 03:46:47.580]  up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD, 300%, that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[03:46:47.580 --> 03:46:53.820]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain.

[03:47:02.220 --> 03:47:16.060]  order, it's Alex Jones. And we are taking live callers info bear in Wyoming. You're on the
[03:47:16.060 --> 03:47:25.420]  air. Thank you for your patience. Hi, can you hear me okay? Sure can. Okay. Hey, thanks for having
[03:47:25.420 --> 03:47:32.220]  me on. I'm a long time listener and 24 hour streamer of the info war. Anyway, I wanted to point
[03:47:32.220 --> 03:47:37.660]  out to everybody, in the event we lose power, of course, we're not going to have refrigeration. Well,
[03:47:38.380 --> 03:47:45.500]  there is an out to that. You can get a hold of refrigerators in RZs. Okay, they run off of both
[03:47:45.500 --> 03:47:52.460]  gas and electric. Theramonia, they have no moving parts at all. Primarily what makes them run is
[03:47:52.460 --> 03:47:58.300]  heat going up the stack. If you look at one and you look where the flame is and where the flame
[03:47:58.300 --> 03:48:04.540]  goes, you'll see the heat runs up the stack. That's what makes it cold. You can replace it if you
[03:48:04.540 --> 03:48:12.540]  don't have propane, you can use a simple candle or even a parabolic mirror, like like a magnifying
[03:48:12.540 --> 03:48:19.100]  glass type effect. If you follow it up ways, you'll see two wires going up and that's where the
[03:48:19.980 --> 03:48:27.180]  electric heat pad is. You can have a heat source there. Anyway, it's a simple way. What's going
[03:48:27.180 --> 03:48:30.780]  to happen? No, you're not going to have, but you're not going to have any kind of a thermostat. It's
[03:48:30.780 --> 03:48:37.340]  going to run full blast, full cold. So just let you know. But what you do for your refrigerated
[03:48:37.340 --> 03:48:43.740]  items is you use a cooler inside the inside of it and the cooler is to keep things from freezing
[03:48:43.740 --> 03:48:49.340]  because it's going to actually get to about 10, 20 below zero inside the thing. But that's the way
[03:48:49.340 --> 03:48:56.460]  they have both keep it frozen meat and your refrigerated items when there is no power. Also,
[03:48:56.460 --> 03:49:01.180]  I wanted to point out to all listeners, also real quick if I can, I want to point out to all
[03:49:01.180 --> 03:49:06.380]  listeners out there that are trying to chat. Hey guys, don't get discouraged. They're manipulating
[03:49:06.380 --> 03:49:11.740]  chat and whatnot. People aren't, you're not getting out. It looks like you are a lot of times,
[03:49:11.740 --> 03:49:16.620]  but actually you're not getting out. So make sure you feel all alone. It's part of their strategy.
[03:49:16.620 --> 03:49:23.340]  Don't get discouraged. Keep up the good work. Keep spreading the links and whatnot. And we'll
[03:49:23.340 --> 03:49:27.100]  survive this and we'll get through it. That's all I got. Thanks a lot for having me on.
[03:49:28.300 --> 03:49:31.740]  Thank you, InfoBed. That's very encouraging and you're absolutely right.
[03:49:31.740 --> 03:49:36.140]  There are far more of us than they'd like us to think. We're going to go to Eric in Indiana
[03:49:36.140 --> 03:49:43.100]  about power outages. Eric, you're on the end. Hello. Yes. Hello. Can you hear me okay? Yes,
[03:49:43.100 --> 03:49:48.860]  we can. Loud and clear. Okay. All right. This isn't so much about preparation, but I was just
[03:49:48.860 --> 03:49:55.420]  curious. I'm a long time enforce listener and supporter and everything. And I just had a question.
[03:49:56.140 --> 03:50:01.580]  I was curious about, first, is what the blame really is from China? Is it just like a built
[03:50:01.580 --> 03:50:07.980]  narrative, a distraction or whatnot? Was it like a false flag balloon, basically? And
[03:50:09.740 --> 03:50:15.100]  if they did that, it would be a built narrative in the sense that they could shut down a localized
[03:50:15.100 --> 03:50:21.580]  area, climate as an EMP. And if it really was an EMP that they were trying to do, I mean,
[03:50:21.580 --> 03:50:29.100]  wouldn't that or could it destroy their own technocratic movements, their own
[03:50:29.100 --> 03:50:32.940]  technocracy that are trying to put in place all of they've created? It's hard for me to
[03:50:32.940 --> 03:50:37.660]  believe that they would do an EMP. I mean, I can see them saying it's EMP and then
[03:50:39.420 --> 03:50:43.260]  shut down localized. And then people have this narrative in their head that it was the EMP.
[03:50:43.260 --> 03:50:48.380]  But at that point, they could go ahead and continue to build back better. I don't know.
[03:50:48.380 --> 03:50:52.700]  I mean, I know they're crazy enough to do the EMP. I just don't know if they're that desperate
[03:50:52.700 --> 03:50:59.020]  at this point or if they want to talk about that. You raise a really, really, really good point,
[03:50:59.020 --> 03:51:02.780]  Eric. And I want to address it before I, because we have a lot of calls to get through. But this
[03:51:02.780 --> 03:51:07.740]  is crucial. This is what I love about free thinking people. We always think outside the box. So
[03:51:07.740 --> 03:51:12.380]  first and foremost, it possibly was not a balloon from China. You're right. It could have been
[03:51:12.380 --> 03:51:18.540]  just a show to make people think that China's doing something or to make people think that China is
[03:51:18.540 --> 03:51:24.460]  a threat when, in fact, China is working with the New World Order in order to create this narrative.
[03:51:24.460 --> 03:51:30.540]  You're right. The other thing is that would they actually do this? Yes, they would. They would do
[03:51:30.540 --> 03:51:38.060]  it, Eric, because they said that a huge cyber pandemic is coming and that the only way to overcome
[03:51:38.060 --> 03:51:44.380]  this is to shut everything down, shut down banks, shut down phones, absolutely everything. This is
[03:51:44.380 --> 03:51:49.420]  why they've been testing the EBS, the emergency broadcasting systems all around the world over
[03:51:49.420 --> 03:51:56.140]  the past two years, three years now, because they have a plan and the BBC, as I said at the start
[03:51:56.140 --> 03:52:00.700]  of this show, the BBC has already war-gamed how they're going to communicate this to the public
[03:52:00.700 --> 03:52:06.540]  when it happens. They have a plan to shut everything down and the only way to come back from it will
[03:52:06.540 --> 03:52:12.220]  be through a digital vaccine, they say. Yuval Noah Harari has even said, you will not be able to
[03:52:12.220 --> 03:52:17.180]  function in our society without a digital vaccine. So what they're doing right now, Eric, is they're
[03:52:17.180 --> 03:52:22.300]  testing the waters and they're doing the conditioning for this. The next two years will be filled
[03:52:22.300 --> 03:52:27.660]  with the tax of this nature and I think the balloon was part of creating that narrative. Does that
[03:52:27.660 --> 03:52:33.500]  make sense? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I agree with you. I just wanted to run a bio. Okay, yeah.
[03:52:34.380 --> 03:52:38.620]  Good to hear from you, Eric. You take care. We're going to go to Diego in Los Angeles.
[03:52:38.620 --> 03:52:46.940]  Hello, do you hear me? Yes. Hi, hello. So I'm just talking about being prepared.
[03:52:49.340 --> 03:52:54.780]  Yes, please, let us know. Okay. All right. So I wrote down a couple of bulletin points. So of
[03:52:54.780 --> 03:52:59.740]  course, have cash on hand to prepare for the bail-in. Have a little bit of Bitcoin, gold,
[03:52:59.740 --> 03:53:05.420]  and silver. We already covered that topic, but specifically for the EMPs and the nuclear war
[03:53:05.420 --> 03:53:11.180]  that could happen. For those who live in California, Crescent, I think it's got a strategic location.
[03:53:11.820 --> 03:53:17.420]  Crescent City is a good area to go if you live in California. I'm going to go down real quick.
[03:53:18.860 --> 03:53:24.060]  Man and woman power is very important because I only have two hands. I can't do everything with
[03:53:24.060 --> 03:53:29.820]  two hands. So it's very important to have a community with you so you can get more things done.
[03:53:29.820 --> 03:53:35.980]  Also, practice getting used to having no power. So when it does come, if it does come,
[03:53:35.980 --> 03:53:41.580]  you have already been training for that. Also, have some firepower on hand, of course. And above
[03:53:41.580 --> 03:53:47.500]  all, support info wars. I started listening to info wars about three, four years ago,
[03:53:47.500 --> 03:53:53.500]  just before the clock shots happened. And I told my whole family about it. My family is a bunch of
[03:53:53.500 --> 03:53:57.420]  lawyers, doctors, engineers, and none of them listened to me. I was the only one telling them
[03:53:57.420 --> 03:54:04.540]  if it wasn't for info wars, maybe I would have taken it too. So above all, support info wars.
[03:54:05.420 --> 03:54:08.940]  It's good to be aware. You have to be aware so you're not walking around blindfolded
[03:54:09.980 --> 03:54:15.180]  and do what you can. Just stay positive, keep a good head on your shoulders, and of course,
[03:54:15.180 --> 03:54:21.900]  pray to God. That's it. Wonderful, Diego. You're so right. So important to be aware,
[03:54:21.900 --> 03:54:26.300]  and this broadcast plays a crucial role. We're going to go to John in Maine on prepping. John,
[03:54:26.300 --> 03:54:32.860]  you're on the air. Hello, everybody. First and foremost, info wars by the product. They're
[03:54:32.860 --> 03:54:37.180]  really awesome to bring forth. But I think I'm going to follow up on what he was saying about
[03:54:37.740 --> 03:54:44.140]  community. I think it's very important to use local friends as resources to create those
[03:54:44.140 --> 03:54:49.980]  connections now. If you may have some keeping body with young people, do it all yourself.
[03:54:51.180 --> 03:54:55.500]  We're having a lot of trouble hearing you, John. I don't know if the connection's bad or you're
[03:54:55.500 --> 03:55:01.660]  not speaking directly into the phone. Go on speakerphone. I was on my Bluetooth. I apologize.
[03:55:04.860 --> 03:55:10.460]  Community. I think no man is an island that we need to reach out to local people and old friends
[03:55:10.460 --> 03:55:15.180]  and see what they've got going on and what we can do to help and where to meet up. If things start
[03:55:15.180 --> 03:55:22.220]  falling apart and try to buy local and do that local community thing. Because we can only survive
[03:55:22.220 --> 03:55:26.540]  ourselves so long no matter how much you prep. So I think you have to build old school communities.
[03:55:26.540 --> 03:55:31.020]  We're blessed. I live in Maine. We have Amish people and we can communicate with those people
[03:55:31.020 --> 03:55:36.620]  of farmers. But still we still have local farmers. So I'd say start creating small micro communities
[03:55:37.340 --> 03:55:43.100]  of real farmers and that kind of stuff. And once again, man, info wars. 100% John.
[03:55:44.700 --> 03:55:49.180]  100% John, I've got to go to the next caller because we're almost out of time. You're right.
[03:55:49.180 --> 03:55:53.580]  Community is key. Michael in Texas, you're the last caller. I'm sorry we didn't get to everyone,
[03:55:53.580 --> 03:55:56.700]  but please in the next minute, Michael, tell us your tips really quickly.
[03:55:57.980 --> 03:56:07.100]  Hi. Is this me? This is you. Yes. Hi, Michael. Okay. So hi. I moved out of the city, just lived
[03:56:07.100 --> 03:56:13.580]  right outside of Austin. Got a couple acres. What people need to do is just be self-reliant,
[03:56:13.580 --> 03:56:20.620]  get some five gallon buckets, some mylar bags, go buy some rice and beans and put some oxygen
[03:56:20.620 --> 03:56:26.620]  packages in there. Fill up your buckets. Just put them away, some flour, powdered milk.
[03:56:27.580 --> 03:56:33.900]  Now's the time to be planting the seeds for your garden. You could grow gardens in little
[03:56:33.900 --> 03:56:43.100]  in five gallon buckets or any. You don't need to have a lot of acreage to grow your own food and
[03:56:43.100 --> 03:56:51.020]  smoke your meat. Just be prepared. Have a water source. If you don't have a well, if you could get
[03:56:51.660 --> 03:56:57.260]  even a kiddie pool or something, those bigger pools that have 500 gallons or something, just
[03:56:58.460 --> 03:57:07.180]  water filtration systems and just get used to being without your daily creature comfort.
[03:57:07.180 --> 03:57:14.780]  Absolutely, Michael. We're almost out of time. You're right. We should all be practicing right
[03:57:14.780 --> 03:57:21.420]  now being used to not having certain resources that we know are under attack, including food,
[03:57:21.420 --> 03:57:25.740]  including power, including water. I mean, you can't survive without water for very long.
[03:57:26.300 --> 03:57:32.220]  Do you see why this broadcast is so crucial? This sharing of information doesn't happen
[03:57:32.220 --> 03:57:38.620]  like this anywhere else in the world. Please support InfoWars and visit the Z Media tab for
[03:57:38.620 --> 03:57:42.380]  all of my latest interviews. God bless you all. I'll see you all next week.
[03:57:46.940 --> 03:57:53.180]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself, the crew,
[03:57:53.180 --> 03:57:58.380]  and our other hosts? Because they know we're pro-human. They know we're telling the truth.
[03:57:58.380 --> 03:58:04.060]  They know we've got their number. They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[03:58:04.780 --> 03:58:09.420]  God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's
[03:58:09.420 --> 03:58:16.540]  stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems. We came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus

[03:59:16.060 --> 03:59:23.660]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations. That way we can consolidate
