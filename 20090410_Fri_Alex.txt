[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:42.960]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:42.960 --> 00:50.120]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are live it is Friday already Friday the 10th day of
[00:50.120 --> 01:00.160]  April 2009 and we are going to be live here for the next four hours coming up
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.600]  we have Captain Kelly Sweeney master mariner joining us the original boat
[01:04.600 --> 01:11.040]  captain has tried to escape and more pirate boats with hostages are heading
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.840]  to the live boat that has the other pirates in it for those that don't know
[01:16.840 --> 01:20.960]  what I'm talking about it's going on right now about 300 miles off the coast
[01:20.960 --> 01:27.920]  of Somalia pirate ships converge on US hostage at sea escalating a dramatic
[01:27.920 --> 01:35.240]  Indian Ocean standoff more than more US warships as well as private reinforcements
[01:35.240 --> 01:41.360]  we start over there escalating a dramatic Indian Ocean standoff more US
[01:41.360 --> 01:49.520]  warships as well as pirate reinforcements with an international gallery of
[01:49.520 --> 01:56.600]  hostages rushed Friday towards the spot where four Somali bandits are holding a
[01:56.600 --> 02:03.520]  USC captain aboard a drifting lifeboat whatever you say about the Somalis
[02:03.520 --> 02:07.280]  ladies and gentlemen they certainly are bold compared to the gelded
[02:07.280 --> 02:11.400]  domesticated Westerners I mean could they're coming on and ragtag ships to
[02:11.400 --> 02:14.720]  basically do battle with all their different stolen ships like something
[02:14.720 --> 02:18.960]  out of a Hollywood fantasy movie something out of Waterworld to have a
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.600]  battle with the US Navy this is just people are unbelievable look how they
[02:22.600 --> 02:27.840]  ran off the Delta Force in the Army Rangers in Somalia of course the UN
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.240]  sat there giving them no reinforcements these people are just amazing of course
[02:31.240 --> 02:35.520]  Americans used to be like that look at the Alamo look at 1776 this is just how
[02:35.520 --> 02:42.520]  people were but of course they don't drink fluoride in in Somalia though they
[02:42.520 --> 02:46.760]  haven't been taking their shots either the pirates apparently fear being shot
[02:46.760 --> 02:51.160]  or arrested if they hand over captain Richard Phillips captured in a failed
[02:51.160 --> 02:57.240]  effort to seize the Maserick Alabama on Wednesday and hope to link up with their
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.200]  colleagues who are using Russian German Filipino and other hostages captured in
[03:02.200 --> 03:09.080]  recent days as human shields US Central Command Chief General David
[03:09.080 --> 03:14.080]  Betrayus at US warships are also headed to the area more than 300 miles off
[03:14.080 --> 03:19.240]  Somalia's Indian Ocean coast we want to ensure that we have all capability that
[03:19.240 --> 03:22.920]  might be needed over the course of the coming days he said pirates have been
[03:22.920 --> 03:27.640]  holding Philippines hostage aboard the lifeboat since his crew thwarted the
[03:27.640 --> 03:39.920]  attack Wednesday on the 17,000 ton US flagged Alabama Muhammad Samaw a Somali
[03:39.920 --> 03:45.840]  resident of the pirate stronghold in Central Ellie town who claims to have a
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.600]  share in a British owned ship hijacked Monday said four foreign ships previously
[03:51.600 --> 03:56.880]  captured by pirates are heading towards the lifeboat a total of 54 hostages are
[03:56.880 --> 04:02.680]  on two of the ships seized by the pirates citizens of China Germany Russia
[04:02.680 --> 04:06.880]  Ukraine the Philippines Indonesia Taiwan other nations the pirates have
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.440]  summoned assistance skiffs and mother ships are heading towards the area from
[04:12.440 --> 04:16.640]  the coast said an aerobic based diplomat who spoke in condition anonymity
[04:16.640 --> 04:20.440]  because he is not authorized to speak to the media we knew they were gathering
[04:20.440 --> 04:29.000]  yesterday Samaw said the two ships left the city on Wednesday afternoon a third
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.640]  sailed from another city another pirate base in Central Somalia and a fourth was
[04:35.640 --> 04:41.560]  a Taiwanese fishing vessel seized Monday that was already only 30 miles from the
[04:41.560 --> 04:46.400]  lifeboat he said the ships included the German cargo ship
[04:46.400 --> 04:53.080]  Hansa stabbinger seized earlier last month I mean this is insane but of
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.360]  course they won't let the ships be armed protect themselves no we the

[08:32.640 --> 08:36.400]  just covered that and the latest developments there but he'll be joining
[08:36.400 --> 08:42.000]  as he has a lot of inside sources and actually knows the captain in control
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.280]  of the ship that they retook from the pirates but then the pirates jumped
[08:46.280 --> 08:55.800]  overboard with the captain onto a dingy and now all these pirate ships are
[08:55.800 --> 08:59.960]  coming out to defend it as the insanity intensifies for those that just joined us
[08:59.960 --> 09:05.400]  so that's coming up Bob Chapman with us once a week visit with us getting into
[09:05.400 --> 09:09.600]  the latest developments on the economy every week closing out the week with all

[09:46.600 --> 09:57.200]  theft of 12.8 trillion and so he will be joining us coming up later so that is
[09:57.200 --> 10:06.840]  coming up we'll also be simulcasting the last two hours of the show live at

[10:11.480 --> 10:15.320]  hours we do the whole show simulcast spinning on what guess we have where the
[10:15.320 --> 10:21.080]  radio show becomes a three-dimensional TV show we can show you documents video
[10:21.080 --> 10:25.800]  collection and adds a whole another dimension to exposing the globalist and
[10:25.800 --> 10:32.760]  their criminal activities going on on the planetary scale I have a lot of other
[10:32.760 --> 10:41.640]  news I want to go over now here and we will have open phones when we have Bob
[10:41.640 --> 10:49.600]  Chapman on in the next hour on the economy okay here is the news this is
[10:49.600 --> 10:55.920]  out of a Canadian free press Pelosi we want registration
[10:55.920 --> 11:05.560]  Holder says 2a won't stand in our way Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on
[11:05.560 --> 11:09.760]  April 7th acknowledged that gun registration is on her agenda days after
[11:09.760 --> 11:12.360]  Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters in Mexico that the Second
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.800]  Amendment would not stand in the way that is a quote ladies and gentlemen
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.080]  of administration plan to crack down on alleged gun trafficking to Mexico yeah
[11:20.080 --> 11:22.920]  and he's been saying it in press conferences that they've got to
[11:22.920 --> 11:27.000]  register all gun owners and shut down gun shows and a bunch of other and they've
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.760]  got the bills introduced bills the White House chief of staff when he was in the
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.800]  house last year introduced those are reintroduced and then the media just
[11:33.800 --> 11:38.040]  goes your conspiracy theorist that doesn't exist remember two years ago
[11:38.040 --> 11:43.720]  until senator sessions of Alabama violated Senate rules thank God and
[11:43.720 --> 11:50.360]  released the bill you know going back until a few decades ago senators house
[11:50.360 --> 11:54.320]  members were in control of themselves but the way they've gotten around
[11:54.320 --> 11:59.920]  liberty in the house and Senate is they've passed rules in the house they're
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.880]  not laws in the house and Senate and if you don't follow those rules you get
[12:04.880 --> 12:10.000]  censured or get in trouble or they could possibly impeach you but they
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.600]  certainly won't give you committee seats in the future and they want that
[12:13.600 --> 12:19.080]  power so they've corrupted the house and Senate where they will say oh this is a
[12:19.080 --> 12:25.040]  secret bill and no one is allowed to read it and then only committee chairman
[12:25.040 --> 12:29.200]  and others are allowed to see it and remember two years ago the media was
[12:29.200 --> 12:32.840]  saying it is not an amnesty bill but we're not going to let you see it this
[12:32.840 --> 12:37.880]  just lets us control and understand and you know create a system to deal with
[12:37.880 --> 12:44.400]  illegal immigration and they said it's a conspiracy theory this is not amnesty
[12:44.400 --> 12:48.280]  because they tried the three years before that to pass total blanket amnesty
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.000]  for over 20 million illegal aliens in the country and to allow them to bring in
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.480]  any other family members in perpetuity and anybody who'd even committed
[12:56.480 --> 13:00.520]  felonies this was in the news would be given a waiver to be citizens and
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.080]  anybody who was here could bring upwards of 12 family members in in the next two
[13:05.080 --> 13:09.920]  years after and this was a blank check for six years to be sunset in six years
[13:09.920 --> 13:16.040]  or extended again people said no we know it's amnesty we've seen the last three
[13:16.040 --> 13:19.560]  versions and they said no it's not and senator sessions
[13:19.560 --> 13:22.280]  leaked the bill
[13:22.280 --> 13:25.320]  it was so politically popular they didn't censure him
[13:25.320 --> 13:29.960]  and uh... you can google uh... the twenty loopholes in the amnesty bill
[13:29.960 --> 13:31.200]  and then he leaked the bill
[13:31.200 --> 13:33.760]  but that was from his office that's what it's called
[13:33.760 --> 13:37.720]  you can just google the twenty loopholes in the immigration bill will come up
[13:37.720 --> 13:39.040]  and it's the same thing here
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.880]  the attorney general has introduced briefings of the supreme court arguing
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.800]  for the complete gun ban of all americans of any firearms
[13:47.800 --> 13:52.480]  saying no citizen should be allowed to even own a single shot that's on record
[13:52.480 --> 13:53.360]  that's public
[13:53.360 --> 13:55.080]  you've got all these bills
[13:55.080 --> 13:57.680]  introduced
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.440]  hr forty five and others that we've read on air the subsection saying
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.320]  register all gun owners may make it a privilege you've got to get a federal
[14:05.320 --> 14:10.000]  license to own a gun and reopen every year and pay huge fees per firearm
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.400]  hundreds of dollars depending on which building it is different variants fifty
[14:13.400 --> 14:18.560]  bucks seventy five hundred and fifty two fifty go read it for yourself
[14:18.560 --> 14:22.160]  but they know the public doesn't read and doesn't check so they say all there's
[14:22.160 --> 14:24.040]  nothing going on
[14:24.040 --> 14:27.800]  uh... that another bill where the attorney general can ban any firearms he
[14:27.800 --> 14:28.960]  wants
[14:28.960 --> 14:33.520]  he just gives him the blank check imperial godlike emperor king like
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.080]  rule of kings law of kings
[14:37.080 --> 14:39.020]  system
[14:39.020 --> 14:41.720]  there's that bill i mean there's a whole bunch of these things and they're
[14:41.720 --> 14:44.240]  moving through the house and senate
[14:44.240 --> 14:51.240]  policy's given press conferences it's in the associated press holders given them
[14:52.320 --> 14:55.020]  and what do they do
[14:55.020 --> 14:57.720]  what do they say
[14:57.720 --> 15:00.080]  what do they push
[15:00.080 --> 15:02.280]  what do they drive
[15:02.280 --> 15:04.640]  what do they pump
[15:04.640 --> 15:09.280]  what are they hammer
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.300]  that none of it exists and if you talk about it you're a cop killer
[15:14.300 --> 15:16.520]  i mean that is their mantra
[15:16.520 --> 15:20.240]  you know when the feds blew up oklahoma city
[15:20.240 --> 15:23.000]  back in nineteen ninety five and you don't know about that it seemed i feel
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.640]  for free online or get the dvd in our quality
[15:25.640 --> 15:29.360]  got a local newscast and eyewitnesses people we interviewed
[15:29.360 --> 15:36.360]  you know with the police and grand jurors everybody admit the feds blew at sky high
[15:38.200 --> 15:41.640]  they had to kill cops and people to shut them up after it happened
[15:41.640 --> 15:44.680]  keep the story quiet
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.840]  and they tried to blame that on talk radio on chuck harder and rush limbaugh
[15:48.840 --> 15:50.040]  on all these people
[15:50.040 --> 15:53.640]  asinine
[15:53.640 --> 15:57.480]  and now they say all this i mean i had a reporter on from the pittsburgh post
[15:57.480 --> 15:59.760]  because that he called me yesterday
[15:59.760 --> 16:02.480]  and i'm sitting on the phone with him and i'm going look they do have bills
[16:02.480 --> 16:05.400]  introduced to do this and he just wouldn't answer
[16:05.400 --> 16:06.720]  and i said hey
[16:06.720 --> 16:09.840]  he's right another story i said you know he was like well i don't believe your
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.480]  conspiracy theories and i said
[16:11.480 --> 16:13.800]  well all the newspapers are admitting
[16:13.800 --> 16:15.600]  that they're setting up world government
[16:15.600 --> 16:17.880]  to be run by a private group of banks
[16:17.880 --> 16:21.960]  and uh... he just said to me he said uh...

[16:25.000 --> 16:26.080]  world government
[16:26.080 --> 16:28.200]  he said all i don't trust the british press
[16:28.200 --> 16:31.520]  and i said the wall street journal new york times time magazine newsweek
[16:31.520 --> 16:33.920]  he just said i don't believe in those conspiracies alex
[16:33.920 --> 16:35.480]  and i said no no no
[16:35.480 --> 16:40.040]  the it's uh... you're a reporter a well-known reporter in your state
[16:40.040 --> 16:42.020]  he's probably writing a new
[16:42.020 --> 16:43.860]  piece for slate
[16:43.860 --> 16:47.520]  which i'm sure will be hard
[16:47.520 --> 16:48.560]  and uh...
[16:48.560 --> 16:50.260]  y'all sit there talking to him
[16:50.260 --> 16:52.960]  and it just doesn't matter folks it doesn't exist
[16:52.960 --> 16:54.680]  these bills don't exist
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.560]  the attorney general doesn't exist
[16:56.560 --> 17:00.760]  his statements don't exist see they don't want us mounting opposition as they
[17:00.760 --> 17:02.760]  come after the guns
[17:02.760 --> 17:04.840]  it's a military tactic
[17:04.840 --> 17:07.520]  when they're charted world war one the germans and the british and the
[17:07.520 --> 17:09.000]  french on both sides
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.560]  you know the allies the french the germans
[17:11.560 --> 17:14.980]  well the french the germans are on their side the austrian hong gree empire
[17:14.980 --> 17:16.660]  on their side and on the
[17:16.660 --> 17:20.760]  other side is the french the british the russians the u.s
[17:20.760 --> 17:23.920]  and they have loudspeaker saying we're not attacking where your friend laid on
[17:23.920 --> 17:25.520]  your arms come over to us
[17:25.520 --> 17:28.760]  as the tanks are rolling the planes are bombing and strafing
[17:28.760 --> 17:32.280]  and and and and thousands are dying per hour
[17:32.280 --> 17:34.780]  and some of these battles
[17:34.780 --> 17:36.000]  millions dead
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.900]  millions died
[17:37.900 --> 17:40.520]  and they're saying this is not an assault
[17:40.520 --> 17:44.240]  same thing in world war two both sides did it same thing in vietnam both sides
[17:44.240 --> 17:44.960]  did it
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.560]  same thing in waco is the tanks ramming into the side machine gunning the people
[17:48.560 --> 17:49.600]  the flare footage
[17:49.600 --> 17:52.400]  their broadcasting this is not an assault we're here to help come out with your
[17:52.400 --> 17:55.520]  hands up they come out with their hands up they shoot them dead in a hammer
[17:55.520 --> 17:57.200]  and they're saying this is not an assault
[17:57.200 --> 18:00.760]  this is not an assault this is not an assault this is not an assault this is
[18:00.760 --> 18:01.760]  not an assault
[18:01.760 --> 18:05.160]  and then some white supremacist because he is freaked out
[18:05.160 --> 18:08.120]  no one they're coming for guns and because he's living with mommy and lost
[18:08.120 --> 18:10.120]  his job and freaked out
[18:10.120 --> 18:12.320]  that's ninety percent of it but ten percent of it is because he knows they're
[18:12.320 --> 18:13.160]  coming for guns
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.200]  he's just sick alive and sick of it all
[18:15.200 --> 18:17.120]  so he
[18:17.120 --> 18:19.840]  just like the somalis that have nothing to live for he just goes ahead and
[18:19.840 --> 18:22.400]  starts killing
[18:22.400 --> 18:24.600]  you gotta be desperate and hardcore to be the
[18:24.600 --> 18:26.560]  somali pirates steaming out
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.800]  to face down the u.s navy and fighter bombers
[18:29.800 --> 18:33.920]  waving ak forty sevens in the air ready to die they're like hey we're men
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.000]  we're ready to fight you let's go
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.520]  i don't like what they're doing but you gotta admire them
[18:42.520 --> 18:45.520]  you know american women want a castrated male on prozac
[18:45.520 --> 18:47.360]  wearing a flower outfit
[18:47.360 --> 18:50.560]  of course they really don't want that so they never satisfied those somali women
[18:50.560 --> 18:52.360]  are out there waiting for the pirates to come back
[18:52.360 --> 18:55.920]  just begging for them you know and of course it's primitive but it's what
[18:55.920 --> 18:56.960]  humans are
[18:56.960 --> 18:59.160]  we've gotten away from what we are
[18:59.160 --> 19:02.560]  and you take all that primitive energy and you put it into rocket bases and
[19:02.560 --> 19:03.760]  science and
[19:03.760 --> 19:08.920]  technology and colonization of space and goals you take that incredible energy
[19:08.920 --> 19:09.960]  and courage
[19:09.960 --> 19:12.880]  and you go out in space colonies and that's how you risk your life
[19:12.880 --> 19:16.480]  because if you're not doing that you're not happy we're meant to risk our lives
[19:16.480 --> 19:17.640]  we're meant to
[19:17.640 --> 19:20.960]  uh... battle we're meant to climb Mount Everest
[19:20.960 --> 19:21.760]  we're meant to
[19:21.760 --> 19:25.720]  plumb the depths of the oceans we're meant to risk our lives
[19:25.720 --> 19:30.560]  we're meant to risk our lives in defense of our tribe
[19:30.560 --> 19:34.720]  but i digress the point here is they are coming for our guns and and and and
[19:34.720 --> 19:38.400]  let me give the government a newsflash your propaganda doesn't work anymore
[19:38.400 --> 19:41.720]  that's why they're selling over a million guns a month
[19:41.720 --> 19:43.880]  the instant check is over a million
[19:43.880 --> 19:46.720]  two hundred and something thousand purchases a month
[19:46.720 --> 19:48.200]  you got it
[19:48.200 --> 19:50.040]  it's more than doubled
[19:50.040 --> 19:53.560]  we know what you're up to and you're cruising for a bruising
[19:53.560 --> 20:00.560]  we'll be right back
[20:01.720 --> 20:05.720]  with our economy spiraling out of control living in the soup kitchens may be
[20:05.720 --> 20:07.200]  right around the corner
[20:07.200 --> 20:11.480]  no one saw the financial collapse of nineteen twenty nine many didn't make it
[20:11.480 --> 20:16.360]  and millions ended up in soup lines becoming vagrants begging for food
[20:16.360 --> 20:20.120]  unlike nineteen twenty nine we can see this collapse coming
[20:20.120 --> 20:24.360]  we have been warned and right now we have a very small window of opportunity to
[20:24.360 --> 20:29.000]  get food storage into our homes before it's too late too late why is the

[25:41.560 --> 25:52.440]  days ago about chemtrails and I was wrong to do it I apologize but I also
[25:52.440 --> 25:55.680]  blow up at people that call me up and say no they're not trying more gun
[25:55.680 --> 26:02.960]  control because I this is so sickening what's happening it's all coming down on
[26:02.960 --> 26:09.080]  us it's all happening there's no more even denying it and people just get in
[26:09.080 --> 26:13.320]  denial or they nitpick around the edges of things they go oh there's not a bill
[26:13.320 --> 26:22.080]  introduced like HR 1444 1444 1444 they got an extra four there and all the
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.920]  other versions they had that says set up a federal agency to prepare you know
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.600]  compulsory national service and they go well that's not come national compulsory
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.120]  service they just say they're preparing an agency to do that you know I look the
[26:37.120 --> 26:41.920]  the White House chief of staff the president all of them say national
[26:41.920 --> 26:45.680]  compulsory service and they're all pushing it and you need to stop living
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.880]  in denial and then I get these emails and calls going Alex it says nothing
[26:50.880 --> 26:54.400]  about chemtrails and that associated press in London Guardian story with
[26:54.400 --> 26:59.200]  Obama's chief science advisor saying we need to terraform the planet to stop
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.800]  global warming well of course they don't call it chemtrails but if you read the
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.320]  scientific report he cites and you go read the CFR report that I have in my
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.680]  hand right now they have their own names for it
[27:12.680 --> 27:18.120]  geoengineering terraforming but it describes what we have reverse
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.920]  engineered all these years where they're spraying nuclei by mixing key
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.360]  compounds with jet fuel where the pilots don't even know what they're doing and
[27:27.360 --> 27:32.480]  it is dispersed just like cloud seeding out and they're manipulating the
[27:32.480 --> 27:37.280]  atmosphere folks and then they say oh well we're just testing looking at doing
[27:37.280 --> 27:50.720]  it you know again it's all lawyer terms the testing it is lawyer terms they say
[27:50.720 --> 27:55.360]  oh we're just testing it right now testing the terraforming technology with
[27:55.360 --> 28:00.960]  all these giant no see that's the legalese it's like us code title 50
[28:00.960 --> 28:08.200]  chapter 32 subsection 1520 a paragraph b states oh we can't do any chemical
[28:08.200 --> 28:12.760]  biological or radiological testing on the American people or the military
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.240]  without their consent and so every time I source that the people go look Alex it
[28:17.240 --> 28:21.080]  says the opposite it says right here they can't do it until you read below it
[28:21.080 --> 28:29.200]  the exceptions for any research purposes any humanitarian purposes any law
[28:29.200 --> 28:37.680]  enforcement purposes it's the exemption so of course they call it research you
[28:37.680 --> 28:42.320]  know I meant to bring it this morning my dad grew up my mom grew up with those
[28:42.320 --> 28:46.680]  books of knowledge in world books and they don't really put those out anymore
[28:46.680 --> 28:52.320]  so we bought several decades worth of them off of ebay very cheaply for my
[28:52.320 --> 29:00.240]  children and they read them voraciously and I read them too so you know keep them
[29:00.240 --> 29:03.480]  laying around the house and I just flip open different ones and you know
[29:03.480 --> 29:08.320]  basically read through them every week and you see nothing but propaganda and a
[29:08.320 --> 29:12.560]  lot of them but but it's old propaganda by looking at old propaganda you learn
[29:12.560 --> 29:18.040]  the new propaganda you know I mean it it it it breaks the continuity of their
[29:18.040 --> 29:21.880]  propaganda by by going back and seeing how they alter it and change it and there
[29:21.880 --> 29:26.080]  was a big PR article I meant to bring it about the wonderful Tuskegee Institute
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.320]  for black folks in Alabama and pictures of happy black folks out front and how
[29:30.320 --> 29:33.320]  they're there to help black people meanwhile they're inside injecting them
[29:33.320 --> 29:38.000]  with syphilis and killing them and having it spread it over 45 years so see
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.200]  everything they do is to make it sound like it's a good thing I'm gonna come
[29:42.200 --> 29:45.640]  back into all of it I look they're coming for your guns I'm gonna finish up
[29:45.640 --> 29:55.600]  with that one get back we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.600 --> 30:04.120]  and the GCN radio network in the new world orders war against humanity
[30:04.120 --> 30:08.920]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake in
[30:08.920 --> 30:13.560]  creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to say the
[30:13.560 --> 30:18.200]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[30:18.200 --> 30:22.440]  interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging yeah fudged
[30:22.440 --> 30:26.640]  since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[30:26.640 --> 30:31.240]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of
[30:31.240 --> 30:38.520]  extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left or

[33:37.120 --> 33:41.000]  and give speeches saying we've got to have aircraft fly around and then they
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.520]  list the scientific terms for it there's a laundry list of them to spray the
[33:44.520 --> 33:48.560]  atmosphere to create a sunscreen to block the earth to keep you safe and
[33:48.560 --> 33:53.240]  then government written textbooks for sixth graders say it and college
[33:53.240 --> 33:57.720]  textbooks say it you can just google textbook talks about chemtrails you'll
[33:57.720 --> 34:03.160]  get links to the textbooks and no screenshots of it it's everywhere and
[34:03.160 --> 34:07.920]  then Obama's science advisor comes out in his first ever press conference and
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.040]  first thing he brings up is we got a terraform things you know to save the
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.960]  earth this is the type of stuff we've got going on and then I go my gosh they're
[34:16.960 --> 34:21.320]  just admitting it they're rolling it out and people call me an email me and say
[34:21.320 --> 34:25.840]  Alex especially the emails Alex they're there they don't say anything about
[34:25.840 --> 34:30.000]  chemtrails they're talking about weather modification well of course they
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.600]  don't use the slang term that the public's been using for 14 years since
[34:35.600 --> 34:41.880]  this stuff started hot and heavy you know we can call it aerosol sprays also
[34:41.880 --> 34:48.280]  what it's known as is the layman's term you know it's kind of like I call a dog
[34:48.280 --> 34:54.800]  a dog you know what a scientist what a biologist what a zoologist calls a dog
[34:54.800 --> 35:02.600]  well they call a wolf I've got the exact designation for a wolf it's canine
[35:02.600 --> 35:08.920]  something you're dealing with it being wild like let me just say guys google the
[35:08.920 --> 35:14.480]  definition the scientific scientific name for a wolf it's but I do know the
[35:14.480 --> 35:20.000]  scientific name for your house dog it's canine familiar us meaning it's
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  familiar in the Latin meaning it lives with you canine familiar us and you've
[35:26.000 --> 35:35.080]  got feline familiar familiar us that means the cat that lives with you it's
[35:35.080 --> 35:40.280]  domesticated it lives with you it's familiar you know you say about a woman
[35:40.280 --> 35:46.840]  you know especially in the sexual connotation it is she is his familiar
[35:46.840 --> 35:51.880]  or in black magic the spirits you work with is what the world leaders believe
[35:51.880 --> 35:54.840]  in Tony Blair in the mainstream news being possessed by the spirit of the
[35:54.840 --> 35:58.840]  light every morning I can't make this stuff up Google if you don't believe me
[35:58.840 --> 36:04.520]  folks you know he's familiar spirits okay canine familiar us feline
[36:04.520 --> 36:14.320]  familiar us I guess it would be what are pigs poor scenes poor scene
[36:14.320 --> 36:18.320]  familiar as I guess if you had a pet elephant it would be pack-a-derm familiar
[36:18.320 --> 36:26.680]  us oh no a trained seal would be peniped familiar this I guess okay well of
[36:26.680 --> 36:32.800]  course we call them chemtrails the government is calling them high
[36:32.800 --> 36:43.960]  altitude atmospheric modification aerosol programs and atmospheric
[36:43.960 --> 36:51.160]  unilateral geode alterations this is the type of stuff we're dealing with here
[36:51.160 --> 36:55.280]  ladies and gentlemen as you guys find me the definition of a of a domestic dog
[36:55.280 --> 37:09.480]  wolf subspecies canis lupus okay the wolf is canis lupus what is canis lupus I
[37:09.480 --> 37:19.080]  don't know Latin very well I know canis means dog what's lupus in Latin
[37:19.080 --> 37:24.760]  Mexican wolf statistics gray wolf statistics red wolf statistics I've
[37:24.760 --> 37:28.880]  seen one of those in Texas I was out hog hunting once on our ranch walking
[37:28.880 --> 37:34.400]  through deep woods and wasn't it was not a coyote big giant red wolf ran ten
[37:34.400 --> 37:42.680]  feet in front of me could have blasted him with my Mac 90 but I didn't
[37:44.160 --> 37:49.480]  anyways of course good thing I did not it's illegal to shoot him here in Texas
[37:49.480 --> 37:56.360]  but not that anybody would have ever known about it so what is what does
[37:56.360 --> 38:03.360]  lupus mean and and oh no that's a particular one that the gray wolf is
[38:03.360 --> 38:10.840]  canis lupus I want the general Latin for so the gray wolf is canis lupus red
[38:10.840 --> 38:17.320]  wolf is canis rufus of course so I guess lupus means gray rufus I know means
[38:17.320 --> 38:25.440]  red and Latin canis rufus here's arctic wolf species canis lupus
[38:25.440 --> 38:32.920]  arktos arktos means I guess the god of the north in Latin arktos meaning arctic
[38:32.920 --> 38:45.520]  so it means dog gray arctic here's the Mackenzie Valley wolf canis lupus
[38:45.520 --> 38:51.160]  oxidentalis now now I could go on and on here so so so I'm calling it a wolf
[38:51.160 --> 38:57.520]  baby I'm calling it a chemtrail I mean you let him play these little games with
[38:57.520 --> 39:02.080]  you oh we're not chemtrailing we're just mixing with the jet fuel and other
[39:02.080 --> 39:08.600]  sprayers and spraying the atmosphere without asking you and denying it all
[39:08.600 --> 39:12.920]  these years and now we tell you we're rolling it out people go well they say
[39:12.920 --> 39:18.720]  they're rolling out they ain't saying they've done it the the reports he cites
[39:18.720 --> 39:22.640]  so the reports we've been covering that they've been admitting for a year where
[39:22.640 --> 39:26.960]  they're rolling this out to the slaves of how they're flying around chemtrailing
[39:26.960 --> 39:32.680]  everyone but they call it a test how about I walk up with a ball peen hammer
[39:32.680 --> 39:38.520]  and knock you upside the head with it one one blow how about how or how about
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.280]  you hit yourself in the head as hard as you can with a hammer and then you call
[39:43.280 --> 39:49.880]  that a test how about you take a butcher knife and jam it in your own throat and
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.080]  just call it a test because that's what they're doing with us you know this is
[39:54.080 --> 39:59.600]  the crew that are control freaks that puts sodium fluoride in the water with
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.600]  all the thousands of university studies going back to the 20s University of
[40:03.600 --> 40:07.640]  Texas I'm gonna read one of those about how it was a toxic shedative and how it
[40:07.640 --> 40:13.920]  calcified in all the major glands and bones and caused cancer how about you
[40:13.920 --> 40:21.040]  read pull it surprise winning books out there it's not sure as rise of all
[40:21.040 --> 40:26.240]  third right it's another one but he mentions it I gotta Google that where
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.840]  where the Nazis would put it in the labor camp water and they learned that
[40:29.840 --> 40:33.720]  from the Soviets and they had a pact with Stalin before they broke the pact
[40:33.720 --> 40:39.240]  and invaded Poland but I digress I mean they play these games with you Obama
[40:39.240 --> 40:44.280]  says and I've seen the clip online I've played it in fact guys this is too
[40:44.280 --> 40:47.840]  powerful not to play I can't just claim this and not play it it's like when I
[40:47.840 --> 40:50.880]  say I have the news saying Mercury's good for your brain you know I got to play
[40:50.880 --> 40:57.240]  that clip Google Obama on gun control it's one of the top ones on YouTube and
[40:57.240 --> 41:01.000]  he says look I'm not saying we're gonna ban your guns overnight this isn't gonna
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  be done overnight but we're gonna have reasonable gun control and we're gonna
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.160]  do it incrementally and then he again supported as a state senator total gun
[41:11.160 --> 41:15.160]  bans and his attorney general supports the DC gunman and says no citizens be
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.560]  allowed to own any gun period anywhere in the country and then you let him play
[41:19.560 --> 41:23.240]  that semantical game with you now I didn't say we'd ban everything overnight
[41:23.240 --> 41:28.360]  we just want reasonable gun control and then we end up not having a debate
[41:28.360 --> 41:32.240]  about we don't want gun control it's we have a debate about what are they lying
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.680]  or aren't they it's a trick it's to stall you it's to throw a stumbling block in
[41:36.680 --> 41:40.000]  front of you and then we end up arguing about that all day it's like you got a
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.600]  bunch of Doberman pinchers chasing you you know the globalists are trying to
[41:44.600 --> 41:47.240]  rob the American people of our liberties they're running off of the Jewel of
[41:47.240 --> 41:50.720]  Liberty and we're chasing after them and they're throwing T-bone stakes over
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.520]  their shoulders just to get us to stop and start chewing on them Democrat House
[41:55.520 --> 41:59.280]  Speaker Nancy Pelosi on April 7th acknowledged that the gun registration
[41:59.280 --> 42:03.720]  this is in mainstream news is on her agenda days after turning general Eric
[42:03.720 --> 42:07.760]  Holder told reporters in Mexico that the Second Amendment would not stand in the
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.080]  way of administration plans then you can go to the article up on info wars
[42:12.080 --> 42:15.280]  dot com for Canadian Free Press and it's got hyperlink senate go read the
[42:15.280 --> 42:19.120]  mainstream news I mean go read it and weep and I mean you sit there and you

[42:49.840 --> 42:53.840]  you please Google these articles about world government I don't believe in
[42:53.840 --> 43:00.880]  that you don't believe in that huh you don't believe in the theory of gravity
[43:00.880 --> 43:04.360]  the law of gravity what you don't believe if you jump off a cliff without a
[43:04.360 --> 43:08.800]  parachute 500 feet down to spikes that you're gonna die I mean you know you
[43:08.800 --> 43:11.480]  don't believe you stick your hand in boiling water it's gonna get burned I
[43:11.480 --> 43:16.600]  mean look listen to me this is like Carl Rove saying they control reality he's at
[43:16.600 --> 43:19.680]  a dinner party with the press New York Times Washington Post reporters in
[43:19.680 --> 43:22.440]  front of them and they say look you really are killing a lot of Iraq he's
[43:22.440 --> 43:25.320]  hundreds of thousands are dead this is one year into the war you know there
[43:25.320 --> 43:29.120]  weren't WMD's you know if that was a lie he says look you guys don't count
[43:29.120 --> 43:32.280]  anymore I we control reality in the government and next week will change
[43:32.280 --> 43:37.800]  reality and then you'll accept that and you'll report on the new reality but
[43:37.800 --> 43:49.760]  what it is is it's mass delusion it's mass delusion they just tell you all the
[43:49.760 --> 43:53.720]  amnesty bill doesn't have anything about amnesty in it and then it says total
[43:53.720 --> 43:58.040]  legalization of all the legal aliens for six years they can bring in all their
[43:58.040 --> 44:04.080]  families get unlimited welfare day one just instant green card citizenship
[44:04.080 --> 44:08.440]  within one year aggravated felons get to stay they just sign a pledge not to be
[44:08.440 --> 44:14.160]  bad anymore you know and then it turned out it was a total amnesty bill and it's
[44:14.160 --> 44:20.240]  the same thing they just lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and I people call
[44:20.240 --> 44:24.520]  me up going Alex even after senator sessions leaked the bill going are you
[44:24.520 --> 44:29.800]  sure it's really as I heard Republicans on talk radio saying and they wouldn't
[44:29.800 --> 44:40.240]  lie no but you know Bush would lie and you know come on man we want registration
[44:40.240 --> 44:48.640]  holder and it goes on these are alarming remarks from speaker Pelosi and
[44:48.640 --> 44:52.640]  attorney general holder to the second amendment foundation founder Alan Gottlieb
[44:52.640 --> 44:56.800]  it appears the Obama administration a Capitol Hill anti gunners are have
[44:56.800 --> 45:00.480]  dropped all pretenses about their plans for gun owners rights and it looks like
[45:00.480 --> 45:05.920]  the gloves are coming off and they're heralding this one white supremacist who
[45:05.920 --> 45:10.920]  attacks me as their poster boy to get our guns he was crazy and said they wanted
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.360]  guns so he killed cops not mommy told him get out the dogs were urinating
[45:15.360 --> 45:19.320]  everywhere he got in at 3 a.m. drunk he was probably still drunk through a
[45:19.320 --> 45:24.320]  fitness shot the cops no they're making it about cops died come on cops go after
[45:24.320 --> 45:29.920]  the American people's guns come on and if you let me tell you let the government
[45:29.920 --> 45:33.960]  sick you on the gun owners it's going to be a self-fulfilling prophecy and then
[45:33.960 --> 45:38.040]  Katie bar the door and I'm begging you police and military not to violate the
[45:38.040 --> 45:40.640]  bill of rights and Constitution is let me tell you something there's a lot of
[45:40.640 --> 45:44.400]  veterans and a lot of people who are just sick of it and I'm on and I'm getting
[45:44.400 --> 45:48.400]  attacked every day for not calling for World War three to start I'm getting
[45:48.400 --> 45:53.160]  attacked for telling people to stand down not to get into a fight with you and
[45:53.160 --> 45:56.600]  that's why the media hates my guts is and is now lying and saying I'm calling
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.040]  for violence because when they march you off against the American people like
[46:01.040 --> 46:07.760]  what happened at Leicester and Concord and it's a bloodbath on both sides they're
[46:07.760 --> 46:13.440]  gonna send the feds after me to arrest me and a lot of other folks and they're
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.360]  gonna put on the news we've arrested the guy that said kill cops and it won't
[46:17.360 --> 46:20.720]  matter if it's a lie just like they say they're not for amnesty when they've
[46:20.720 --> 46:23.840]  reintroduced the bills to do it just like they say they're not for gun control
[46:23.840 --> 46:29.640]  when they've got the bills introduced to basically ban anything they want they
[46:29.640 --> 46:34.400]  are a pack of criminal liars and they're coming for our liberty listen all of
[46:34.400 --> 46:37.840]  human history is slavery and bondage our entire human history is about the
[46:37.840 --> 46:41.680]  struggle for decency and honor and dignity and freedom and liberty and a
[46:41.680 --> 46:45.320]  chance to have your own little parcel of land and live in peace without a bunch
[46:45.320 --> 46:49.760]  of parasites coming by with armed thugs trying to make you their slave the
[46:49.760 --> 46:56.040]  Middle Ages the Dark Ages the Renaissance Africa Asia the Middle East the
[46:56.040 --> 47:00.640]  Americas tribe and slaving tribe killing each other ganging up on smaller
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.400]  tribes this is what it's all about and somehow they they they never taught the
[47:06.400 --> 47:12.080]  last few generations this was what the human struggle was about and we've got
[47:12.080 --> 47:15.440]  a good and the good people have to get together and guard against tyranny and
[47:15.440 --> 47:23.680]  then then it's it's almost impossible to be it's almost impossible to stop I mean
[47:23.680 --> 47:26.960]  if you know all about it educate everybody do everything you can to fight
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.240]  corruption it is still a battle that you've got a fight because it always
[47:31.240 --> 47:36.320]  runs rampant until it implodes see it's impossible to stop it growing and trying
[47:36.320 --> 47:39.920]  to take over and generally does but then it falls on its own because it gets so
[47:39.920 --> 47:47.040]  decadent delusional and power-tripping with psychos running it's impossible to
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.000]  stop and it's impossible for it not to fall you understand the cycle except in
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.520]  a few special times in history and it still wasn't perfect now they got the
[47:58.520 --> 48:01.840]  yuppies and everybody else thinking everything's fine the government's here
[48:01.840 --> 48:05.720]  like your butler it's gonna take care of you it loves you everything's great like
[48:05.720 --> 48:10.040]  I got this 911 call and I keep seeing these every week now woman calls on
[48:10.040 --> 48:15.280]  Burger King because hamburger cold woman calls especially women I'm not
[48:15.280 --> 48:21.040]  knocking women but on average I mean they're domesticated you know they think
[48:21.040 --> 48:24.800]  the government's there to help them they're nanny and I didn't get my dollar
[48:24.800 --> 48:35.760]  50 of extra shrimp and so I'm calling the police and she shows up inside without
[48:35.760 --> 48:39.280]  the food and says give me my money back for the whole thing and they said no you
[48:39.280 --> 48:45.720]  got to bring the food back in she says no so she calls 911 and the police show
[48:45.720 --> 48:56.080]  up over the shrimp that clips up on prison planet calm halfway down the page now
[48:56.080 --> 49:02.000]  I mean think of her compared to the Somalis these people know that there are
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.440]  attack frigates fighter bombers everything else they don't stand a
[49:07.440 --> 49:16.000]  chance but they're so bold they want to fight so bad they're so manly they're
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.240]  so vicious they're so tough they're so cunning and towards the dark side
[49:21.240 --> 49:24.640]  definitely I mean you can go overboard with this and it leads to the dark side
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.520]  it's got to be a balance there but the but the issue is you know you got to be
[49:28.520 --> 49:32.440]  vicious and tough and defensive innocence because if you don't the evil who
[49:32.440 --> 49:37.720]  are bold like these Somali pirates raping killing stealing stealing you know
[49:37.720 --> 49:41.400]  hundreds of millions of dollars a month now they've got dozens of hijacked ships
[49:41.400 --> 49:46.520]  right now they come out three or four guys and take over whole ships the
[49:46.520 --> 49:50.560]  disarmed Americans fought back kicked them off the ship they kidnapped the
[49:50.560 --> 49:55.240]  captain they're in a dinghy and all these us ships are surrounding them and so
[49:55.240 --> 50:07.640]  here come the pirates the pirates are now preparing to engage the US Navy see
[50:07.640 --> 50:13.840]  they're the complete opposite of what we've become I mean you can't help but
[50:13.840 --> 50:19.080]  admire them I'll tell you that I've watched the films of the Somalis
[50:19.080 --> 50:22.520]  fighting it's just devilish I mean there's no other way to describe it it is
[50:22.520 --> 50:29.320]  devilish because they're ready to die and unlike on average you know the
[50:29.320 --> 50:32.600]  stereotype of Arabs not being trained to shoot being emotional and not aiming
[50:32.600 --> 50:42.520]  the Somalis aim because they're Africans they're not Arabs it's devilish but
[50:42.520 --> 50:47.600]  then you've got the opposite you got us American men with big tats all over them
[50:47.600 --> 50:51.760]  strutting around no fear bugging their eyes out the little guy at the supermarket
[50:51.760 --> 50:57.040]  these big boys see a cop they start urinating down their leg and you won't
[50:57.040 --> 51:02.240]  fight for your own country your cowards your cowards attention gardeners this
[51:02.240 --> 51:07.000]  is an urgent GCN self-reliance update GCN has just discovered a new bioactive
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.640]  superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's so
[51:10.640 --> 51:14.120]  effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to

[51:25.160 --> 51:29.040]  bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time proto grow works by
[51:29.040 --> 51:32.320]  providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic
[51:32.320 --> 51:35.360]  code for nutritional uptake in plants proto grows full spectrum plant
[51:35.360 --> 51:38.280]  fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to ten

[54:20.040 --> 54:24.200]  are the Somalis do they leave at least four large ships and a bunch of small
[54:24.200 --> 54:29.280]  ones in Armada some of the ships now within just a few miles hours ago they
[54:29.280 --> 54:37.520]  reported 30 miles away out there in the Indian Ocean and I mean
[54:37.520 --> 54:41.520]  these Somalis are just something else folks that's what happens when you've
[54:41.520 --> 54:46.160]  had hundreds of years of starvation and survival of the fittest it is just I've
[54:46.160 --> 54:50.040]  never seen anybody like these Somalis we got Captain Kelly Sweeney master
[54:50.040 --> 54:53.920]  mariner successfully repelled off the Dominican Republic a famous pirate
[54:53.920 --> 54:59.440]  attack killed some of them one of his mates was the deputy captain is now the
[54:59.440 --> 55:02.400]  captain of the ship because the captain's been kidnapped of the ship
[55:02.400 --> 55:08.200]  retook the 17,000 ton vessel but he's got the latest info ladies and gentlemen
[55:08.200 --> 55:12.120]  from his sources out there and again he's friends with the man who is now the
[55:12.120 --> 55:16.560]  captain good to have you here with us captain Sweeney thank you Alex great
[55:16.560 --> 55:20.800]  being with you thank you it's the latest I mean these Somalis are amazing you
[55:20.800 --> 55:26.080]  know it is amazing and it's what situation is right now and if I find
[55:26.080 --> 55:31.840]  very interesting it's gone from a hijacked situation where you know the
[55:31.840 --> 55:38.960]  usual Somali and pirate attack held a ship for ransom this and that now it's
[55:38.960 --> 55:44.000]  become a hostage situation and this is a whole new scenario and it's very
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.920]  interesting of course that it's a US flag ship I know that Captain Murphy and
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.280]  they're in the they had a contingent of 18 armed guards of course it's after the
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.080]  fact you know but working with their way to Mombasa and they're off the port of
[55:57.080 --> 56:05.200]  Mombasa right now the the pirates have decided to up the ante a little bit and
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.360]  are bringing over as you pointed out merchant vessels that have already been
[56:09.360 --> 56:13.040]  here in six ships that were hit this week and they're moving some of those
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.760]  over into that area so we're talking to stand off and to show down at sea this
[56:18.760 --> 56:23.200]  is unbelievable now you've got a lot of inside contacts you learned about this
[56:23.200 --> 56:28.960]  hijacking hours before it was even in the news any other inside info right now
[56:28.960 --> 56:34.320]  it's closed off the sources that I have a connection for the family they've been
[56:34.320 --> 56:37.640]  closed off everybody's kind of circling the wagons right now I think it's kind
[56:37.640 --> 56:43.040]  of overwhelming and stressful and I haven't heard anything new in the last
[56:43.040 --> 56:47.240]  few hours the last I heard was what you there pointed out was that the they're
[56:47.240 --> 56:51.720]  starting to move some of the hijacked ships over in that area now I've I
[56:51.720 --> 56:57.480]  believe they're going to try to get between or circle around between the
[56:57.480 --> 57:03.600]  lifeboat and the naval vessel and that and that's what I think is going to be
[57:03.600 --> 57:08.080]  happening is that they're going to try to do some kind of a blockade but right
[57:08.080 --> 57:12.560]  now we're at a hostage situation I think that at this point Captain Phillips's
[57:12.560 --> 57:18.360]  life is hanging in the balance and how we react and as much as it I think it's
[57:18.360 --> 57:22.960]  distasteful negotiating with pirates I don't want to you know I wouldn't want
[57:22.960 --> 57:28.240]  to see our reluctance to do everything that we could to save Captain Phillips
[57:28.240 --> 57:33.000]  first and you know his life but won't that I mean I mean I agree we should do it
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.080]  but we got to be careful about it not to wear in control of this we're just
[57:36.080 --> 57:40.480]  looking at it afar that'll only encourage more hijackings you've actually got the
[57:40.480 --> 57:44.480]  pirate fleet coming out they've got hostages on board all of them I'm not
[57:44.480 --> 57:47.920]  saying do this but if they just blew up every ship right now that's all the
[57:47.920 --> 57:52.760]  Somalis respect if they just killed all everybody on those ships this stuff
[57:52.760 --> 57:57.280]  would end very quickly but the Somalis understand that that's not going to
[57:57.280 --> 58:03.440]  happen well I mean if I were one of those Mariners and this is the thing you know the focus has
[58:03.440 --> 58:09.960]  been after the fact here and as a mariner that just irritates and angers me to
[58:09.960 --> 58:15.080]  no end when this all of this could have been prevented if we had taken if the
[58:15.080 --> 58:18.880]  international shipping community and the international maritime organization
[58:18.880 --> 58:23.600]  had done and taken the steps that they needed to do long before now be long
[58:23.600 --> 58:27.640]  before they let it get to this point and now we're a situation where a man's life
[58:27.640 --> 58:31.440]  is hanging in the balance and you know what as a fellow mariner I got to say
[58:31.440 --> 58:35.320]  let's save his life and then worry about the pirate staff right no no I hear you
[58:35.320 --> 58:38.840]  stay there back in one minute sir absolutely the government caused this

[59:53.080 --> 1:00:00.920]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:25.720]  Alex Jones we got Bob Chapman coming up in the next segment he was in military
[1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:30.720]  intelligence also lived in Africa Asia and Europe the largest private gold and
[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:35.080]  silver broker at the time before he retired he can comment on this hijacking
[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:38.080]  situation what he would do and we'll get his take on that we kept it swinging
[1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:40.960]  coming up in a moment then we'll get more into the economy but here's the
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:45.240]  bottom line they disarmed the ships in the last 30 40 years piracy has a
[1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:49.760]  reassurgence explodes they know the ships are sitting ducks now home ports the
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:53.160]  US and others really don't want the ships being armed you got a higher
[1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:57.040]  expensive security if you want then that's even hard so this stuff happens
[1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:01.560]  and you have unarmed American crew taking the ship back from pirates
[1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:05.600]  yesterday kidnapping happens they grabbed the captain jump overboard now
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:09.120]  there's a whole fleet of Somali pirates going out with more hostages to engage
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:13.160]  in Lord knows what saying they're ready to die and they've shown themselves to
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:17.040]  be extremely bold is about as much courage as he gets extremely reckless
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:20.720]  but it's evil courage you know like unlike a Japanese samurai fighting the
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:25.000]  death against equally match enemies they kidnap they murder they kill they are
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.160]  incredible rogues though you can't help but it respect them deeply in a
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:34.840]  sickening way but captain look we know we're gonna get law the sea global tax
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:40.120]  on all the ships with the UN armored convoys what they're calling for so
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:42.920]  that again they disarm us then we got to have them protect us and then they
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:47.480]  they're the greater tyranny of the seas and just more gun controls what they're
[1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:51.480]  calling for now instead of arming all the ships and that's what's so disgusting
[1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:58.240]  about this so how do you see this ending as you said the captain is is is just in
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:02.720]  a real crisis really is I like them everybody I talked to all my fellow
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:06.920]  mariners everybody's praying for Captain Phillip because this is a situation
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:11.680]  where this guy was a hero is a hero and he did what he could to save his ship
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:16.240]  and crew and I mean that's just you know hopefully doesn't have to pay the
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:20.680]  ultimate price to do that and it's an unfortunate and it's terrible and he had
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:25.000]  to be even put into this situation and then other mariners like myself had to
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:28.240]  be put in that situation I worked with Shane Murphy he was one of the the other
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:33.840]  officers on the ship I was on in 2003 and 4 Shane who's now the acting captain
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:40.480]  he's a strong young aggressive sharp guy and I feel that he probably was also
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:44.280]  instrumental in overtaking those pirates because he's not the kind of just sit
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:49.760]  idly by and let things happen he's a real sharp guy and it was unfortunate
[1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:53.240]  they got put into that situation I mean here they are delivering humanitarian
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:57.880]  aid you know for famine relief and they come out and they you know they get
[1:02:57.880 --> 1:03:01.600]  hijacked it's like what's wrong with that picture you know the Somalis are
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:05.600]  actually taking food out of the mouths starving people by doing no they're
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:08.760]  horrible they're crazy they're absolutely horrible well I mean what's
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:12.560]  happened in Somalia for those that don't know the scum over the last few
[1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:17.000]  hundred years because it's been you know continually in crisis and
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.040]  starvation it just the most evil of the most evil of the most bold the most
[1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:27.840]  bold have gotten in control there and it's just a horrible situation and I
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:30.240]  how do you see this ending I mean I agree with you they're gonna try to pull
[1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:35.040]  around yeah I I think they're gonna I think they're gonna force the hand I
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:39.720]  personally believe that they're gonna try to have some situation where the
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:44.640]  pirates are allowed to because the life was gonna run out of fuel soon I mean
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:48.720]  there's only so much fuel in that lifeboat and after it's gone it's gone
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:53.560]  and they're just drifting so I think my feeling is they're gonna try to make
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:58.360]  some kind of a agreement that the pirates that are holding Captain Phillips
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.800]  are gonna be allowed access either on one of the vessels or whatever to get
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:10.720]  back ashore and then hold him in an exchange for ransom money you know to
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:14.480]  get away I think that's the the plan that they have and that they want because
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:17.880]  even though they talk a good game I'm sure and you know and they're they've
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:22.520]  shown that they're willing to go all the way with it I think deep down nobody
[1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:27.160]  really wants to end up dead you know for something like this you know they'd
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:30.600]  much rather be able to spend all that good money that they stole from and
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:35.920]  get extorted on a ransom payment and so I think that's what their plan is now
[1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:41.360]  it's a very delicate situation I mean they got the FBI over there I mean they
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:44.960]  got the shipping company the shipping company is the US flag ship but it's a
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:50.680]  Danish owned company and they've got this European mentality that in general is
[1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:56.160]  highly against weapons on board vessel it's called nitting it's not that
[1:04:56.160 --> 1:04:58.840]  Europeans are cowards at heart their governments don't want to set the
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:02.360]  precedent of the people defending themselves you already know that drinking

[1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:50.120]  for joining us I'm Alex Jones your host Bob Chapman the international
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:53.920]  forecaster.com it was the rest of the hour finishing up with Captain Kelly
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:57.960]  Sweeney master mariner successfully repelled a pirate attack off the coast
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:04.320]  of one of the major islands in the Caribbean the Dominican Republic in
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:11.360]  Haiti and killed some of the pirates now he knows the current captain the second
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:16.840]  command is now the captain because the captain when the yesterday when the
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:21.560]  people on board the hijacked ship from Somali pirates 300 miles off the coast
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:24.840]  of Somalia in the Indian Ocean we're able to take it back these Somalis were
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:29.360]  still able at gunpoint to hold the captain and so then they went on to a
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:33.600]  dinghy it's all surrounded again I'm recapping this for people that they're
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:37.920]  just joining us about the US Navy but then a flotella of small boats and four
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.600]  to six large ships that have been hijacked in last week are coming out
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:46.720]  with the hostages Chinese German Indian you name it a whole bunch of countries
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:52.400]  are coming out holding them hostage now to get the other hostage and this is
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:57.760]  escalating it to an entirely new level and we do hope that Captain Phillips who
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:00.520]  is just an amazing individual recapping for those that don't know
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:05.480]  specifically Captain Sweeney Captain Phillips how did he get grabbed by the
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:11.200]  pirates in the exchange well obviously I wasn't there but what I've heard Alex
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:15.760]  is that they told everybody which is part of our training to go to a safe room
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:20.120]  and that's the the ship's security plan will have a place that everybody knows
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:26.120]  on board when that happens where to go and that I believe personally that the
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:32.480]  the pirates that entered the house and and then were confused on what was
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:36.440]  happening either they had set up barriers or they had locked doors and they
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:40.720]  were corded they cordoned them off or whatever but in any case they stormed
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:45.600]  the pirates who then went outside onto the deck and it kind of a regrouping
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:49.400]  position and then at that point they decided that some of the pirates decided
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:55.440]  to go in the lifeboat and head out with the captain as a hostage and he offered
[1:10:55.440 --> 1:11:00.240]  himself as I understand for the protection and safety of his vessel and
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:06.960]  crew the the officers the remaining officers on board Shane was now in charge
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:10.960]  and they were met and the remainder of the officers and crew had one pirate
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:15.200]  hostage that they held and then they made an agreement with the pirates down in
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:20.200]  the lifeboat to exchange that one guy for the captain and they let that guy go
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:24.560]  but then the pirates didn't let the captain go and so that's where the
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:30.120]  situation is right now and so they've got the the Marist Alabama out of harm's
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:34.960]  way and so now it's a hostage situation and what's gonna happen after you know
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:38.680]  this thing has been going on for the longest time the Rand report came out
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:42.800]  last year and criticize the Bush administration for focusing way too much
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:48.400]  on maritime terrorism and way too little on maritime piracy and that was a study
[1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:52.400]  that by the Rand corporation that came out and it's just continuing now the
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:56.280]  world community is just doing lip service now they have the warships from
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:11:59.440]  different countries go through and try to make it as safe going through the
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:03.720]  Gulf of Aden but now we're having ships get hit three four hundred miles off the
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:07.200]  coast that's really like finding a needle in a haystack well here's another
[1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:12.560]  example I had been down to Bolliver since I was a teenager little strand of
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:21.800]  beach that's right across a little piece of water from Galveston Texas and I
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:26.680]  won't ever go there again they rudely searched me and basically everybody
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:33.160]  else except illegal aliens who I saw them leaving alone literally when I went on
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:37.800]  the ferry when I got off the ferry homeland security but meanwhile every
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:41.600]  few months I read about just off the coast of Galveston pleasure boats being
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:44.360]  pirated and the people being killed never found again on their boats being
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.600]  taken and those are no doubt pirates that are running out of Galveston so again
[1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:54.080]  this is all a complete stinking fraud for the imaginary boogeyman of terrorism
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:59.160]  while real crime and piracy explodes worldwide yes and that you know in the
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:02.360]  Rand corporation basically said that and I know a guy who's a chief engineer on
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:07.240]  one of those ferries and they're people that are made recreational voters that
[1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:10.840]  are missing all the time Alex and you know they we get reports of them on
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:14.680]  commercial vessels you know this boat lost such a position nobody on board
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:18.560]  and you know not all of them will go overboard because of bad weather and you
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:22.040]  know they get knocked over the head I believe or they you know get killed
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:27.160]  actually you know recently there was a couple that was off the coast of Thailand
[1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:29.880]  I know that's a long way away but they were doing their retirement dream of
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:34.040]  sailing around the world and the husband got his head blown off and killed and
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:39.480]  they were grandparents and the wife got tied up raped and left her dead and
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:43.240]  she was managed she managed to escape she had to walk to crawl over the deck
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:46.800]  through her husband's blood to get away well tell folks before we go to Bob
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:49.800]  Chapman how many I appreciate Bob holding on this take on this mental let
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:54.200]  you go get me swinging breaking news I read constantly about yachts and
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:57.280]  people's boats all over the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean being grabbed I
[1:13:57.280 --> 1:14:00.760]  mean it's massive it just it doesn't it it doesn't make it in the front page of
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:04.600]  the paper that's true and they don't want it to and then they play this game
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:09.240]  like if it's in the certain close as certain territorial waters they call it
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:13.600]  armed attack which is the same thing as a piracy tag at the same people only they
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:18.520]  do it inside this imaginary line in the water territorial or international
[1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:23.240]  waters and so a lot of the piracy tax are called armed attack and they're not
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:27.040]  included in those statistics and so it's just playing this game with statistics
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:31.400]  and everything I mean it's the you know and this is you know this ship is the
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:35.960]  first US ship that was taken hijacked but it wasn't certainly by any stretch
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:39.920]  the first ship that was hit by pirates that happens all the time well you got
[1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:43.680]  hit to show how much it happens one of your one of your mates when you were
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:47.800]  captain when you guys repelled the attack in the Caribbean on your huge
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:53.360]  ship he's now the captain of the ship that was hijacked that's right actually
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:56.800]  I was a I wasn't the captain on that one I was going in for a friend of mine so I
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:01.640]  was one of the officers too and that can happen on my watch and I mean you know
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:05.240]  that's the I mean that's just what happened is unbelievable Shane was up
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:09.560]  sleeping when that happened he was off watch but I mean it's just a terrible
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:13.640]  situation and they've let it go to this point who are now it's a they've got a
[1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:18.880]  confrontation here's the US Navy in a confrontation with a bunch of pirates and
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:23.440]  hijacked vessels flotilla I mean this is an amazing situation but I can't
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:27.440]  believe it ever got allowed to get to this look it's clear they need to put
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:33.320]  out the order tell the Somalis you know drop leaflets that they're gonna bomb
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:38.280]  all their port facilities the country's run by terrorist real terrorist it's
[1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:41.480]  run by people that the government the criminal government is getting the
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:45.640]  money for all of this to fund their operation from the piracy it's
[1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:49.960]  government run and the United States this is real terrorism folks like of
[1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:53.440]  Mexico attacked us twice we fought back and went all the way to Mexico City with
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:56.960]  the Marines and took it over well the real attacks happen this is an al-Qaeda
[1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:01.360]  made up this is real and you just give them you give them 12 hours to get out
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:05.560]  of the ports and you destroy Somalis ports I mean I mean do you think that's
[1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:10.080]  a bad idea well I think personally what I would like to see first I would like
[1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:14.680]  to see the restriction on merchant vessels having weapons be taken off and
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:19.480]  have it be a requirement that they have either armed guards on board or trained
[1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:24.480]  crews that with weapons on board through high-risk areas I would also like to
[1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:29.120]  see some kind of mechanism for trying to pirate because this is also bogus you
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:34.360]  know the US Navy a few weeks ago had to hand back a captured pirate because they
[1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:38.000]  had no they didn't know what to do with them it was like catching relief so they
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.880]  were like now what are we going to do I know criminals just like the illegal
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:44.880]  aliens can rob banks they let them go what is your captain you disagree with
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:48.880]  targeted smart bombs you know with satellites know where where the pirates
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:52.760]  are based blowing up all their bases you know right now yes and I'll tell you
[1:16:52.760 --> 1:16:56.480]  why because it how do you it's like Vietnam I a lot of friends are in
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:01.560]  Vietnam and I was in the army just after that but they every one of them told me
[1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:06.320]  we had a heck of a time deciding who was the good guy yeah but that's yeah but
[1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:10.640]  this is like not going to Hanoi this is like not going downtown now I'm saying
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:15.360]  hit their bases that I would say we have if they do that the floating bases but
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:20.840]  even then a few weeks ago the Indian Navy grabbed around expected mothership and
[1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:25.000]  then it turned out to be a tide fishing vessel and they killed all 14 crew
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.840]  members on there so I mean you know it's like I think personally that we need to
[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:33.480]  have a defensive posture and then I would like to see if they do anything they
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:37.080]  should have a blockade of that let's start with that oh I like I don't hear
[1:17:37.080 --> 1:17:41.240]  vessels surrounding the coast instead of trying to make the shipping lane hey
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:44.480]  that's a good idea surround the coast and don't let them come out that's right
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:47.680]  and then I would like and then board the ships that come out because that's
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:51.160]  right they don't be on a certain line it's like hey you go beyond this line
[1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:54.640]  we're gonna search you and if you're just some guy with fishing bay and a few
[1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:58.920]  nets okay go God bless you go if you're a couple of quote-unquote fishermen and
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:03.120]  you've got five or six AK's and a few rocket from an L the rocket fell
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:06.760]  grenade launchers obviously you're not doing much fishing pal come with us okay
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:09.800]  let's bring Bob Chapman up real fast I'm gonna come back with Bob at real Bob
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:16.040]  your take on all this situation well it's a proletariat of ideas and after
[1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:22.280]  sifting through what you both have said coming from the back first off our
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:30.760]  shores we need extensively more coast guard protection I think people should
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:38.160]  be encouraged on personal vessels to have weapons on board and you know an
[1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:46.640]  AR AK riot guns that sort of thing and and I think that can be very helpful is
[1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:55.120]  at least along our coast I think the idea of a blockade is an excellent one I
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:59.960]  don't see that it won't work I mean any anybody that comes out has to be has to
[1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:04.880]  go through the blockade to find out what they're up to yeah one of these guys
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:09.720]  grabbing like six seven big ships a week Kevin Sweeney yeah they got six
[1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:18.280]  this last week alone and I think they've had I saw recently that there are 43
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:23.600]  attempts are successful ones this year I can't remember exactly now I just saw
[1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:28.280]  it recently and of course my wine went blank when I looked at the number but we
[1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:34.120]  had six just this last week alone and as far as I'm concerned we need to our
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:37.400]  merchant vessels and I don't believe in the riot gun rubber bullets thing I
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:41.560]  believe it's something that could have some firepower and you know they'll
[1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:46.880]  enable you to fight back on big ships I agree and these people should be
[1:19:46.880 --> 1:19:52.560]  extremely well trained who are put on there to handle that equipment and and
[1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:58.120]  I think on the high seas that's a way to combat it I'd stay there stay there
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:02.160]  stay there we got a break stay there we'll come right back to you the new

[1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:16.280]  think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the
[1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:20.240]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:24.920]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a
[1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:29.040]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:34.240]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance older bucks
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:40.800]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:13.160]  do the rest of the hour with Bob Chapman riding shotgun with us on the economy a
[1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:20.400]  lot of developments there Captain Sweeney what about this that we hear the
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:25.520]  pirates saying well and some of the Somali community here in the US is
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:29.520]  saying I've seen some of their videos on YouTube that well the ships were
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:34.440]  dumping toxic waste and in nuclear waste off our shore so that's how this
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:40.360]  piracy started was to get money back and now it's turned into greed but then of
[1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:43.680]  course I do know they've dumped reactors off the coast of the United States you
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:46.280]  know that's admitted this is what international companies and people have
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:51.680]  done because the ocean is so wide open is there any truth to that well the
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:56.080]  that's the political side of things Alex I mean I'm a mayor but I will say this
[1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:03.360]  that Somalia hasn't had a government in 20 years and during that time European
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:11.160]  backed fishing companies sent their vessels down to those water and in many
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:16.360]  ways wiped out a good portion of the fishing stock and brought everything
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:21.560]  back and either sold it or aided in Europe you know and so I can understand
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:27.040]  why those people think that way but the problem is lawlessness and piracy are
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:30.280]  not the way to go what they really in my opinion should be working towards is
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:33.760]  having legitimate government so they took all the fish and so now they're
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:38.480]  taking the ships certainly a serious situation well as this develops I'll
[1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:43.480]  see if I can get you to pop on the Sunday show as things unfold thank you
[1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:46.600]  for being with us Captain Sweeney Alex it's always a pleasure and I'm there
[1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:49.200]  anytime and if I'd love to have your listeners get a hold of me I got some

[1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:58.720]  this register with us today goes right to the email I'd love to hear from and
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:01.800]  they can read my stuff by including an article on piracy at professional
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:06.120]  mariner.com professional mariner.com and your book is from the bridge thank you
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:09.960]  so much captain Alex thanks so much smooth sailing do we talk again I take
[1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:13.800]  care Bob Chapman I know you're a cool guy don't mind too much but I apologize
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:21.120]  get you on 10-15 minutes late it's just this is breaking news as you know so Bob
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:25.200]  always open you're awesome Bob finish up the point we're trying to make as we
[1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:30.800]  went into break what I was trying to find out was the region in which the
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:36.120]  six ships were hijacked over the past week in the end of the place or in one
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:43.640]  place no Indian Ocean right off of right off of Somalia yeah okay well I think you
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:47.160]  know a picket line is the best thing I think only one nation should do it I
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:52.880]  think all the other nations should contribute to the cost thereof and I
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:57.760]  think that'll probably bring it to a halt we did the same thing off the
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:04.520]  Barbary Coast 250 years ago with our Marines and I guess it's gonna have to
[1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:12.080]  be done again we know all about Somalia we know where they're coming from yes
[1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:16.800]  they do have a beef about the fishing but you know that could be handled
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:23.040]  financially if the Europeans had any sense but I think that will stop it and
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:29.480]  and and and on the waters off of the United States particularly off of gal
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:34.400]  galveston there should be more protection in the form of Coast Guard off
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:38.840]  there and people should be told it you don't go out there unless you're heavily
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:42.920]  armed but the government instead will arrest you if they catch you with a
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:48.680]  firearm off the coast of the Texas coast or California it's disgusting change the
[1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:55.280]  law absolutely those big ships that are running around out there put cannon on
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:00.360]  deck you know get them heavily armed I mean that's the way to go I mean you
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:04.720]  know some small boat is not gonna attack somebody can blow them out of the
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:09.520]  water we'll go back to you it's gonna be expensive but that's what shipping
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:14.880]  companies and the people who have to pay for the goods have to put up with well
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:18.000]  this happens generationally you know even a hundred years ago all the
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:21.920]  merchant ships are armed 200 years ago and then every time they knock the pirate
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:26.360]  out they take the weapons off the ships and then it starts back over again I
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:30.480]  mean you never saw a British East India company or any merchant ship that
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:34.760]  wasn't trained with weapons and cannon and drills because if you didn't do that
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:39.280]  you were asking for it well I think the bottom line here is that people have to
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:44.400]  understand that these pirates are criminals they have to be treated that
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:47.840]  way hit I have to go to court and they have to go to jail and if they kill
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:52.200]  somebody they have to be hanged all right what's coming up in the next segment
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:57.520]  on the economy I know a lot has happened I mean grab grabbing GM and then saying
[1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:00.920]  the government's not running it when they are running it and then telling them
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:05.760]  what to do and and and just everything that's happening and now Geithner
[1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:09.160]  announcing he doesn't want banks to tell him where the stress test money went
[1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:14.560]  what else is coming up well as far as coming up I mean that's plenty to work
[1:29:14.560 --> 1:29:20.280]  on what they're finding on this stress test and they're trying to delay it is
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:26.200]  and this is what I get from my sources that the banks are all bankrupt and if
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:32.960]  they expose the true position of these banks brokerage houses they're gonna
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:35.600]  have to shut them down and now they don't want to come up with the
[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:40.560]  information all right let's go over that stalling inevitable collapse to be the
[1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:44.400]  latest information with a just amazing financial expert we got another

[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:19.840]  back to bob Chapman bob okay I asked those questions before the break explain
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:24.360]  people for folks what the stress test was what's happening there then we'll get
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:30.040]  into gm first time in history we've got the president firing heads of ceo's
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:34.480]  putting people in place now I said first time in the u.s. that they do this in
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:39.480]  the third world all the time show bob Chapman well there's nothing in this
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:44.240]  constitution that allows the executive branch or congress to fire people from
[1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:48.800]  their jobs it's as simple as that I had it in the last issue and I had it
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:53.320]  researched by someone who does that sort of thing so that said they have no
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:58.680]  right to do so it's illegal for them to do so you can tell the head of general
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:03.840]  modus in the board that it might be a good idea and that the government would
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:07.640]  like them to step out of the way because we put so much money into the
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:13.880]  company that's one thing but they they really can't dictate to them how how it
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:17.680]  worked out what went on behind the scenes I don't know and I don't think
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:23.160]  anybody else does except if you're inside government and on Wall Street as
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:32.720]  far as the the situation with the stress test is concerned it's like any other
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:39.680]  inquiry into the inner workings of the balance sheet of a company and because
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:45.080]  we don't have to mark the market which means you have to get a price market
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:51.200]  related for the items which are on your balance sheet they did away with that
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:57.640]  because they wanted to allow companies to mark to model which means it can be
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:02.480]  anything you want it to be which means it doesn't mean anything and so instead
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:10.760]  of a security being carried at 85 cents on the dollar it might really be worth
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:16.040]  10 or 15 or 20 cents on the dollar and that is the case believe me and so that's
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:20.320]  why they don't want to release the stress test because all the major banks and
[1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:24.840]  most of the big major brokerage houses are broke it's as simple as that they're
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:28.640]  carrying garbage on their books because they were gambling and of course over
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:34.760]  the past 20 months our government in behalf of the American people and
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:40.200]  allowing the American people to pay it pay the bill have bailed out those
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:45.160]  people who were gambling with our economy and within their own companies and
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:50.680]  so you know you say to yourself how do they get away with this well they are
[1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:56.320]  they do anything they want and of course if you talk about it you're an
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:01.800]  extremist you're some kind of a nut and like you and I have been called all the
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:07.960]  time Alex but yeah all we're dealing is with with the truth and that's the truth
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:14.360]  of the matter Bob since you got into us being called nuts I'm you're always
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:19.040]  aware of it seems any news item I raise so I would imagine you know that scores
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:26.300]  of newspapers some of the biggest news sites online are basically saying just
[1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:31.280]  like they did with Limbaugh after the feds bombed ok see a 95 they're saying
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:36.680]  that I'm calling for cop killing which I've never done and they're saying that
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:41.280]  I made this white supremacist kill three cops and shoot two others when it's
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:46.480]  admitted it was a domestic dispute with his mommy kicking him out and it turns
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:49.760]  out the guy didn't like me and attacked me all over the web so and they knew
[1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:54.880]  that so the issue here is that must mean we're really getting to them it when
[1:40:54.880 --> 1:40:58.600]  the hours of these cops being killed the Southern Poverty Law Center fed my
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:01.800]  name into the newspapers and then of course it turned out it was all a
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:06.280]  complete frame up and a lie we know the Southern Poverty Law Center in ADL had
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:09.120]  been caught on record I mean I have the mainstream news stories from the 80s and
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:12.560]  90s creating and leading fake Nazi graves and trying to get violence I
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:19.040]  don't know if they're involved in this but more and more that needs to be
[1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:25.640]  investigated and looked into and something your take on that well we're
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:30.960]  getting close and we're hurting them by telling the people the truth and so they
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:35.520]  have to create lies and that's the way they fight back
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:44.000]  D's has been doing this for years and that's his kind of modus operandi and
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:51.560]  the the ADL has been getting away with illegality for years finally what they
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:57.080]  were doing in the 1960s was brought to court in San Francisco and it was found
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:04.080]  that the San Francisco Police Department was working with them along with the FBI
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:08.040]  and giving them information that they shouldn't have had in the first place
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:12.720]  they had all of the intelligence files and now the ADL runs the my act type
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:19.240]  fusion center reports that is now listing people like Dr. Evan Vieira and
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:22.720]  others who've set up the committees of correspondence we got the latest
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:26.920]  documents out of Virginia I mean this is just getting and there was also a
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:30.520]  report put out in Missouri this is getting more and more insane and I think
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:34.720]  the ADL and these guys are discrediting themselves if they ever had any
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:41.880]  credibility to begin with by lying and demonizing mainline patriotic groups
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:48.120]  who are against gun control and again this is completely illegal go ahead
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:56.520]  well they they started on me in 1967 and and and within the government during the
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:01.120]  80s they were tapping my phones and they do that through that facility that they
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:07.960]  own Israeli owned company that handles all those phone connections and they
[1:43:07.960 --> 1:43:14.520]  threatened to kill me several times and you know for no reason other than the
[1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:20.000]  fact that I was very conservative politically and financially outspoken
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:23.680]  for many many years and of course that's where the government is displeased
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:30.880]  with my behavior as well and they get away with that stuff and I don't know
[1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:34.040]  what's going to stop them from doing what they're doing I think probably
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:39.640]  exposure of what they've done in the past and what they're trying to do now
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:44.920]  and perhaps in the future is the only way we can do it within the law do you
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:49.760]  think Bob this signifies that they're getting ready to intensify the attacks
[1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:55.040]  on me personally or is this just just something to kind of any time the
[1:43:55.040 --> 1:43:59.960]  media mentions me they can go back to this as kind of a label I think it's
[1:43:59.960 --> 1:44:04.440]  both they'd like to knock you out of the box get you off the air they can't do
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:11.320]  that and this is going to be an ongoing campaign of attack and so what do you do
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:15.440]  you continue to expose the things that they're doing illegally and the
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:21.160]  government agencies which are illegally working with them the fact that they
[1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:28.000]  represent a foreign power and this is a bad thing for America and particularly
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:35.120]  at this point in time because we've had heavy infiltration of people who believe
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:40.120]  in Zionism in our administration for the past eight years and they're still
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:45.960]  there and I don't think that's healthy for any nation to have people from
[1:44:45.960 --> 1:44:51.160]  another country or who represent another country telling people in Congress
[1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:57.280]  or paying them off to do what they want them to do well my issue is is that I've
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:04.920]  never found anybody more nasty more unsavory than the anti Jew crowd they
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:09.280]  make stuff up they lie and so I've got them attacking me and then I've got the
[1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:13.880]  Israeli lobbies ADL attacking me I mean you got to know we're in the right here
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:18.080]  folks because you know we've got all these unsavory groups attacking us it's
[1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:22.320]  because we are effectively bringing the people together against the New World
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:27.520]  Order and that is what the establishment does not want they want to make it
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:31.920]  about race they want to make it about Balkanization they want to make it about
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:37.920]  religion so we can be marginalized they're afraid of my big tent approach
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:44.120]  do you agree with that Bob absolutely absolutely and you know I was attacked
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:48.800]  and I never did anything you know I just happened to be associated with people
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:56.320]  who were outspoken hey hey hey mid-1990s I'm like pro-second amendment so the ADL
[1:45:56.320 --> 1:46:00.200]  attacks me and you know I didn't take the bait and then you know automatically
[1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:03.080]  turn into somebody who just you know hates everybody who's involved with
[1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:07.000]  Israel over it I a lot of people do take the bait though and that's what they
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:11.520]  want I mean I'm getting really sick of it I mean I can't stand the ADL I can't
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:15.800]  stand the white supremacist I'm just here trying to get taxes cut get sovereignty
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:20.280]  defend our borders not attack all these countries not go bankrupt I just want to
[1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:23.840]  live in peace and then there's all these other crazies another thing we know the
[1:46:23.840 --> 1:46:27.880]  Israeli lobby did and again I'm not even ever attacking the lobby that much so I
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:32.400]  get attacked for not going after them all the time and then we did confirm that
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:36.960]  this that this one guy is an admitted he admits an Israeli lobby operative makes
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:42.160]  up that I work for the Vatican and I'm an assassin when I'm not even Catholic I'm
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:46.000]  not bashing Catholics my family are famous Protestants that founded Texas and
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:50.080]  then they're and then they don't care the Israeli lobby's got all these crazy
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:55.200]  Protestant all Cromwell groups death-threading me and they're just
[1:46:55.200 --> 1:47:00.080]  complete they manipulate schizophrenics Bob and I just can't mean it's it's
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:06.800]  really getting out of hand it's like a circus it is a circus it is a complete
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:12.000]  and total circus check and then I say my family founded Texas you know the the
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:16.520]  the the you know the Hammons the the the heirs the Johnson's the Joneses all
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:21.440]  involved the heirs you know which is my mother's side of the family raised
[1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:26.640]  Colonel Travis they were here as Protestant rebels to throw the Catholics
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:30.720]  out because they were mad that they made Texans convert to Catholicism to get
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:36.160]  the stuff it's on record my family came into Galveston with the Bibles and then
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:39.880]  literally had the Catholic priests try to get them killed as they ran up to
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:45.160]  Nacogdoches in the history books and an Israeli agent puts out the story that I
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:49.040]  worked for the Vatican and I get death threats and these schizophrenics that
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:52.520]  believe it make me so mad Bob I don't mean to talk about myself on air it's
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:58.320]  just they're out of their minds I'm gonna tell you a funny one Opus D in
[1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:05.120]  Europe tried to recruit me and that's the fact I was I was fund-destruct and
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:09.680]  there's some years ago but I sent to myself why would they want to recruit
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:15.640]  me but anyway those things happen oh yeah well you know I you know what I do
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:19.840]  like I you know we're both on the air you have your own program I don't but I
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:23.480]  just fluff it off I said look this is what I believe about that let's go on to
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:29.040]  more important things let's find out how we can help people do the things that
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:34.600]  they have to do to survive the difficult economic and financial times ahead you
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:40.120]  got people on on the program who are advertising advertising seeds that's
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:46.040]  terrific and the delivery of dehydrated foods you got to do it my family's done
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:51.560]  it and incidentally my daughter lives in Florida and she's raising bananas along
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:57.760]  with her other part of her garden which is getting vast or investor and getting
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:04.080]  gold and silver coins getting a water filter getting the basics to help people
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:08.680]  that they're gonna invest how to do it what not to do the things that are gonna
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:13.240]  help people that's why we're here no no Bob I agree and I the heck with the heck
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:19.280]  with these people who who want to make fools out of themselves by calling us
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:23.680]  these nasty things I just ignore them well well the reason I bring that up as
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:27.600]  I hardly ever talk about this I only bring I know you don't I bring it up so
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:32.440]  people don't get caught up in these traps and I also bring it up because I am
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:36.720]  sick of Israeli operatives trying to pick a fight with me because they want to
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:41.200]  make it all about Jew bashing to discredit anybody that's basically the
[1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:46.960]  government pimps out the ADL to paint anybody as an anti-Semite or pro-Hitler
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:50.920]  who's against the New World Order and and Hitler did kill a bunch of people he
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:56.480]  was bad and so the issue here is the ADL is despicable because they defend
[1:49:56.480 --> 1:50:00.000]  Schwarzenegger who's an admitted Nazi and says he admires Hitler and the
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:04.880]  Rolling Stone but then people who actually fight tyranny they take the
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:10.840]  murders of those Jews and they pimp it out to demonize patriots and then that
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:15.000]  actually adds legitimacy to the criticism of everything Israel's doing so
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:18.840]  you know that's the point I'm making this is part of a larger game plan and
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:23.400]  folks it's destructive to make it about Protestants or Catholics or blacks or
[1:50:23.400 --> 1:50:27.880]  Jews or any of this the reason I raise this we the New World Order is taking
[1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:36.720]  over 12.8 trillion 12.8 trillion has been stolen in the last six months
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:41.560]  according to Bloomberg it is devastating we have to focus and that's only a
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:45.400]  war about balance just stay there let's talk about that when we get back Bob

[1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:21.520]  federal regulator you guys even got death threats exposing how this is all
[1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:31.000]  engineered Bob studying the economy for 40-something years have we ever seen the
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:36.960]  hyperinflation move this big I mean 12.8 trillion in six months and they say
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:40.320]  they're just getting started in their announcing they're gonna take out the
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:47.800]  home exemption the mortgage interest exemption they're going to basically
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:51.360]  raise taxes on everybody to pay the offshore banks and this is only the
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:56.800]  beginning I mean this signifies a complete raping of society well it's a
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:02.000]  total planned disintegration of society in order and it's not only in the United
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:05.280]  States it's particularly in that states in Europe and in the rest of the world
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:09.280]  in order to bring everybody to their knees so they'll accept world government
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:13.040]  and they've done it over and over again it's nothing new so that's what they're
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:20.160]  doing and incidentally and I'm publishing today instead of tomorrow on the
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:26.400]  international forecast and I have the interview with Mr. Black I have the link
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:30.560]  to that and I thought Moyers did a wonderful job I was extraordinarily
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:39.560]  impressed it was a very fair opportunity to expose the information and also if
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:44.960]  you remember Alex six months ago we said on this program that the government and
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:50.560]  the Fed would spend 12 to 13 trillion dollars I had backed into all the figures
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:54.440]  and everybody else at that time was talking 300 billion 500 billion they
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:59.640]  got up to 1.5 trillion and that was the end of it you know bingo we get 12.8
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:06.280]  now we could go to 15 by the end of the year and that's trillion and next year
[1:56:06.280 --> 1:56:12.240]  we could get to 30 if we try hard and all of its to bail out the alumnus the
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:18.600]  banks the brokerage firms now it's insurance companies I mean after AIG we
[1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:23.680]  get three of them in their potential and Hartford and Lincoln are looking for
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:28.640]  tarp money I mean you don't look for tarp money unless you get problems and so
[1:56:28.640 --> 1:56:35.200]  it's gonna it's gonna permeate society and it's gonna I I don't know that this
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:39.880]  is the quote quite the way to say it but it's gonna bring us deep more deeply
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:48.760]  into fascism and corporate control of America through government and we're
[1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:53.960]  not for socialism but when Newsweek magazine comes out and calls it
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:57:00.520]  socialism that's a misdirection this is not going to the people this is piracy
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:10.000]  in a $3,000 suit as opposed to the ragtag groups that run up their ships
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:17.120]  and jump on bigger ships to capture them it's so slimy to watch Geithner but
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:22.080]  you know they're telling them don't let your stress test numbers out because of
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:24.880]  the last week big banks stress test numbers have been coming out that they
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:29.880]  are completely bankrupt because the alumnus as you call them have already
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:34.720]  moved all the real money out the back door well we hear nothing about the
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:39.520]  made-off money we have nothing about the accomplices I mean his two sons
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:43.400]  supposedly knew nothing his wife knew nothing everybody in the company knew
[1:57:43.400 --> 1:57:50.000]  nothing and I say give me a break well sergeant shows ten years ago the SEC
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:56.680]  knew they're part of it but the government was involved in this the CIA was
[1:57:56.680 --> 1:58:02.800]  involved you remember the banks for criminals and crooks incorporated BCCI
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:09.800]  this is just another version but sergeant Schultz says he knows I know
[1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:17.360]  nothing I know nothing remember him from Hogan's heroes mm-hmm I guess that's
[1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:24.880]  who's running things right now huh well they they cook up these things they
[1:58:24.880 --> 1:58:32.800]  also had a precursor to that BCCI which was the the banks in Australia
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:37.040]  nukin hand I'd stay there I want to hear about that when you get back and what
[1:58:37.040 --> 1:58:43.600]  your forecast is how bad this is gonna get stay with us thank you for listening

[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:23.760]  alex jones
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:34.920]  all right Bob Chapman you're finishing up talking about how this has been done
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:41.280]  many times before please continue well this is back in the 80s and this bank in
[2:00:41.280 --> 2:00:48.800]  Australia was being used to launder drug money by people within the defense
[2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:54.400]  establishment and and retired as well as active military people and a lot of
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:58.560]  military people invested in the bank and eventually they could took to the
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:04.960]  cleaners and that's how it started out and then they wanted big-time money
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:09.240]  laundering and nougat in hand with the people who were the front people for
[2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:17.240]  them and I can't remember which one but one of them committed suicide by
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:22.400]  shooting himself in the back of the head and the other fellow went to to jail
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:26.920]  for 20 or 30 years screaming I didn't do anything wrong all I was doing was
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:33.720]  fronting for these people but he went away and eventually that led into BCCI of
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:39.960]  which one person I think might have been sentenced to jail for 18 months or
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:43.680]  something that was another CIA money laundering operation yeah that was
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:47.960]  quite clever nothing happened that was Clark Clifford and and the rest of them
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:53.320]  in Wonder Woman's husband now all right now on top of late they used to be
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:02:01.680]  neighbors of mine a Malibu wonder woman yeah well he was right up in the right
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:05.120]  up the street well up the way from what's her name Linda was a name Linda
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:09.280]  Carter yeah right yeah and she was married one little king pins I just
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:15.160]  remember that now now expanding on that it came out just like you said a couple
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:22.240]  months ago and made off first broke the head of GMAC with the car money is now
[2:02:22.240 --> 2:02:27.600]  being sued by Cuomo up in New York and they're alleging drug dealing and money
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:31.660]  laundering so the same thing we had with Enron these are literally just front
[2:02:31.660 --> 2:02:34.680]  dummy corporations and it looks like they're going to go ahead and just shut
[2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:38.840]  down the big banks too that are just fold-ups that they had out front where
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:44.880]  have they moved all the real assets and in the infrastructure I don't know
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:48.960]  exactly but I know what the made-off money most of it meant went to via the
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:53.160]  Israeli discount brand and bank will meet to Israel and other offshore
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:03:00.120]  accounts hmm I mean I I published that three months ago because I get some
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:05.320]  pretty good contacts in that venue and that that's what gets the ADL all like
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:12.160]  excited because I come out with stuff like that but that's the beginning of
[2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:16.060]  the trail and of course you don't see that in the media you don't hear Mr.
[2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:21.960]  Cuomo talking about that you don't have them talking about anything about where
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:26.040]  all the money went I mean we're talking a hundred billion dollars not fifty not
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:30.820]  ten I hear in the money was never invested it was all just straight up
[2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:36.720]  stolen nobody in the company knew anything give me a break it did just
[2:03:36.720 --> 2:03:40.640]  ridiculous the SEC know for ten years what was going on that meant it was a
[2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:46.560]  government operation they were told keep your hands off it amazing Bob Chapman

[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:30.880]  control fraud in which a business or national executive uses the entity he
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:35.240]  or she controls as a weapon to commit fraud he is currently an associate

[2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:20.320]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while
[2:06:20.320 --> 2:06:24.960]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a
[2:06:24.960 --> 2:06:29.120]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:34.360]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[2:06:34.360 --> 2:06:40.320]  that's fascism it's not about left-to-right it's about a one-world

[2:08:02.880 --> 2:08:08.480]  network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your
[2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:10.800]  mind
[2:08:13.800 --> 2:08:20.400]  years ago I interviewed mr. black several times law professor corporate
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:25.800]  fraud investigator one of the top investigators that went after the
[2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:30.440]  Keating crooks and others the SNL's and they got memos or they were talking
[2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:35.360]  about we want him dead and things like that now the Ponzi schemes are even
[2:08:35.360 --> 2:08:39.120]  larger and more dangerous and he has a lot of courage to be doing what he's
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:42.480]  doing but but I wanted to play a little clip from Bill Moyers because to see
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:46.640]  this on national television not just on our local TV show or on a syndicated
[2:08:46.640 --> 2:08:49.760]  radio I mean that's big to have mr. black on with us now talking about this
[2:08:49.760 --> 2:08:54.120]  but to have it on bill Moyers caused a huge buzz and people really started
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:59.320]  realizing what we were facing here's a quick clip and then bill black the former
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:03.320]  director of the Institute for Fraud Prevention now teaches economics and
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:07.600]  law at the University of Missouri Kansas City during the savings and loan crisis
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:12.480]  it was black who accused then House Speaker Jim Wright and five US senators
[2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:17.840]  including John Glenn and John McCain of doing favors for the SNL's in exchange
[2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:22.400]  for contributions and other perks the senators got off with a slap on the rest
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:27.560]  but so enraged was one of those bankers Charles Keating after whom the Senate's
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:32.640]  so-called Keating five were named he sent a memo that read in part get black
[2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:39.080]  kill him dead metaphorically of course of course now he's focused on an even
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:43.680]  greater scandal and he spares no one not even the president he worked hard to
[2:09:43.680 --> 2:09:49.000]  elect Barack Obama but his main target are the Wall Street Barons who are
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:53.280]  heirs of an early a generation whose scandalous ripoffs of wealth back in the
[2:09:53.280 --> 2:09:58.760]  1930s earned them comparison to Al Capone and the mob and the nickname
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:04.200]  banksters bill black welcome to the journal thank you I was taken with your
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:07.480]  candor at the conference here in New York to hear you say we were we were
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:11.920]  taking with us well to this economic and financial meltdown we were taken with
[2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:16.640]  it as well and that's why we're gonna go to mr. black right now mr. black good
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:21.040]  to have you on with us thank you okay you got the floor for the rest of the
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:23.920]  hour and I want us to take much more time than that because I want you to be
[2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:26.360]  able to complete the interview that you've been gracious enough to do with
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:31.960]  us there in your offices but you know my big issue that I'd like you to speak
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:38.720]  about first is the same crew the same ideas have built Ponzi schemes many
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:44.600]  orders larger and instead of even getting in trouble they're being seen as our
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:50.800]  saviors and offering even bigger Ponzi schemes as their solution so is this
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:57.360]  leading us to rack and ruin you know it is already led us to there but you're
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:04.440]  right unless we remove this ideology and these folks from power they will
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:13.880]  produce recurrent intensifying crises in layman's terms what are we currently
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:21.440]  facing who's guilty how do we stop it well in layman's terms the FBI began
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:29.640]  publicly warning in September 2004 that there was an epidemic their word of
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:35.280]  mortgage fraud and they said if this epidemic is not stopped it will produce
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:41.480]  an economic crisis at least as large as the savings loan debacle and then they
[2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:44.320]  said but of course we've learned the lessons from the savings and loan
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:49.600]  debacle and we'll be all over this one so we won't cause those problems well you
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:54.320]  know they were right about the first two things obviously they weren't even
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:12:00.160]  close to right about third the FBI has said something else immensely important
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:08.320]  and that is that 80% of the mortgage fraud is induced by the lenders so think
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:14.320]  about that in terms of you know taxpayer revolts and things like that it
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:20.080]  shouldn't be focusing on the individual borrowers as much at least as you should
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:26.880]  be focusing on the big CEOs of these specialty places that as you said ran
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:32.440]  Ponzi schemes in order to get extraordinarily rich through their
[2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:37.320]  bonus compensation systems and then you know in many cases walk away and in
[2:12:37.320 --> 2:12:43.320]  other cases remain there still in control and being subsidized by all of us
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:51.240]  taxpayers right now now you know you talk about this being engineered fraud or
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:59.840]  the term you use is this control fraud break that down and then let's get
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:02.280]  specifically into the fraud we're witnessing right now
[2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:08.520]  sure control fraud is simply a term for what happens when you have a seemingly
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:14.600]  legitimate organization in other words as opposed to an obvious mob shop type
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:21.000]  of thing where the person who controls it uses it as a weapon to defraud others
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:29.920]  and if the CEO is the crook he can take care of all the internal controls he
[2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:36.200]  can get rid of all the underwriting and you don't defeat internal controls you
[2:13:36.200 --> 2:13:41.560]  actually suborn them you turn them into allies and so these folks were able to
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:47.720]  get clean-otted opinions from the most elite accounting institutions in the
[2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:52.360]  world even though the places were massively insolvent they were of course
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:59.080]  able to get grossly inflated appraisals from top appraisers and they were able
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:04.480]  to get triple a that's pristine that's supposed to mean zero credit risk triple
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:09.880]  a ratings from the top three rating companies in the world for stuff that
[2:14:09.880 --> 2:14:18.320]  was known in the trade as toxic waste and that allowed them to sell trillions of
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:26.760]  dollars well over two trillion dollars in toxic waste out into the world and of
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:35.040]  course it's led to extraordinarily large loss now this has been described as a
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:39.360]  Ponzi scheme too big to fail and it's now a black hole in that the industry that
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:45.600]  engineered this understands that they can hold the population hostage and say
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:49.240]  just do whatever we say we'll have a depression and then when we end up in a
[2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:52.400]  depression anyways from their activities they're going to be sitting there with
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:57.560]  all the assets well I caught the suicide strategy I don't know if people have
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:15:02.640]  seen blazing saddles but the sheriff is surrounded by hostile town folks he takes
[2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:06.880]  out that his gun points at his own head and says you know don't move or I'll
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:11.720]  shoot and that's essentially what these big banks are doing they're saying you
[2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:17.840]  know give us unlimited amounts of money or we'll fail and if we fail we'll take
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:22.880]  down the entire economy with you why we would believe any of these people is
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:28.360]  beyond me why we would leave in charge people that are willing to make that
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:37.040]  kind of obscene extortion is absolutely beyond me now specifically from your
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:39.720]  experience tell us there's a little bit about who you've investigated in the
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:42.160]  past what you've dealt with you're one of the leading experts really in the
[2:15:42.160 --> 2:15:46.080]  world on going after these types of frauds but the difference here is the
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:49.640]  media is not saying the Keating five are bad the regulators were bad let it
[2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:54.560]  happen instead they're saying these are our saviors so this is this new
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:58.640]  territory where they're just a blank check to do whatever they want now the
[2:15:58.640 --> 2:16:04.480]  terrible shame about this is this isn't simply a case of failing to learn from
[2:16:04.480 --> 2:16:09.880]  the stakes in the past we've forgotten successes in the past so during the
[2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:14.640]  savings and loan debacle for example we actually look God forbid that would be a
[2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:19.240]  nice idea wouldn't it look at what was causing the problem we had a national
[2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:23.640]  commission I was the deputy staff director on that it concluded after
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:29.400]  looking at all the major failures that at the typical large failure fraud was
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:37.720]  their words invariably present and they met fraud from the CEO ranks right so
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:43.760]  there we knew what was going on we knew the pattern that these frauds followed
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:49.880]  and it's very similar to the existing one you've got your underwriting you
[2:16:49.880 --> 2:16:56.240]  pervert your internal controls you grow massively and you make the worst possible
[2:16:56.240 --> 2:17:01.640]  loans because you can grow a lot faster by making bad loans and trying to compete
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:06.600]  for good loans and because bad loans will pay more in the short term in terms of
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:11.560]  higher interest rates and fees and you make a ton of money as an absolute
[2:17:11.560 --> 2:17:17.280]  mathematical guarantee when you do that during the expansion phase of the bubble
[2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:22.000]  and then of course if you it's also guaranteed that you'll produce a
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:27.640]  catastrophe so I was at the staff level the person leading the
[2:17:27.640 --> 2:17:33.400]  re-regulation of the savings loan industry as a litigation director I was
[2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:39.760]  suing the crooks and as I said unlike this crisis we went after places like
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:44.280]  Lincoln savings when they were still reporting they were in the most
[2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:49.600]  profitable savings and loans in the country we said no your frauds and went
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:55.320]  about trying to put them out of business in the current crisis the FBI did not
[2:17:55.320 --> 2:18:01.560]  even begin to investigate the big lenders and remember 80% of the fraud
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:05.360]  according to the FBI comes from the lenders the FBI doesn't even begin to
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:12.680]  investigate them until March of 2007 when the entire secondary market in
[2:18:12.680 --> 2:18:18.440]  toxic waste shuts down and of course it's now two years later and there is not a
[2:18:18.440 --> 2:18:26.440]  single significant indictment of any of these specialty frauds and a whole
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:33.680]  chunk of these folks what they sold was known in the trade as liars loans now
[2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:39.320]  how hard is it as a prosecutor is a regulator to figure out that the trade
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:47.600]  calls something a fraud it's probably a fraud amazing they even label it a
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:51.640]  fraud and and and well we look at made-off how for nine years was he
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:56.280]  telling the SEC this was going on and then when the SEC is asked about it they
[2:18:56.280 --> 2:19:00.480]  say oh he's not guilty or he has a blood guilty yet when he already had and then
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:06.800]  they arrogantly you know declare executive privilege well the SEC has
[2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:14.800]  been emasculated it is utterly non-functional what we now know finally
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:20.200]  because finally Congress started to hold some hearings last year into the
[2:19:20.200 --> 2:19:24.680]  rating agencies and we learned the following things about the rating
[2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:29.120]  agencies and the rating agencies were absolutely critical if you don't get a
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:33.800]  triple-a rating you can't sell this tax wage I'd stay there sir we got a break
[2:19:33.800 --> 2:19:40.840]  quick break come back with our guest William K. Black he is a associate

[2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:14.720]  boiling it all down but in your own words both parties are bought and paid
[2:24:14.720 --> 2:24:19.200]  for by Wall Street Obama got what four times Wall Street money McCain did I'm
[2:24:19.200 --> 2:24:25.240]  not saying I was you know pushing McCain either Obama's claiming he's fighting
[2:24:25.240 --> 2:24:28.760]  Wall Street when his whole administration it seems is filled with the
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:33.240]  very people that's got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act and allowed this to
[2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:37.000]  happen from the 1990s and of course the Bush people are willing and compels us
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:43.460]  as well I mean can you speak specifically to that oh sure clearly the
[2:24:43.460 --> 2:24:53.040]  Reuben Summers Geithner wing of economic advice in the Obama
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:25:01.440]  administration is very very similar to Paul's views in other words that there
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:07.120]  really is not much of a difference at all between the two administrations in
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:13.120]  their view now there was broad bipartisan support for getting rid of the
[2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:20.320]  Glass-Steagall law for example there was broad bipartisan support for destroying
[2:25:20.320 --> 2:25:25.560]  Brooksley-Born's effort to regulate credit default swaps which are the
[2:25:25.560 --> 2:25:31.400]  things that blew up AIG and at AIG the taxpayers have already lost more money
[2:25:31.400 --> 2:25:37.120]  than the entire savings alone cost debacle cost and by the way you know
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:42.600]  AIG we weren't on the hook it's not a federally insured depository that was
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:47.920]  gratuitous give away of taxpayer money so this is a new level of Ponzi schemes
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:52.360]  where they make hundreds of billions and trillions on the way up and now with
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:56.920]  the bailouts on their Ponzi scheme they get even more money on the other side
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:00.280]  of it with the taxpayer on the hook well this will only encourage more fraud
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:05.680]  that's exactly what we're trying to get across you do this type of thing you
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:11.840]  encourage businesses to be even more abusive going forward because they can
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:17.400]  do the most outrageous things get incredibly wealthy through the bonuses
[2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:23.520]  doing them and even when they cause disaster they get new bonuses and more
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:29.840]  compensation paid by the taxpayers it is a system you know that they moved the
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:35.680]  gods must be crazy it's got to be the theme for both administrations because
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:40.360]  it is utterly insane policies but isn't it crazy like a fox I mean they make
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:44.320]  money on building up the pyramid Ponzi scheme and then now because they're in
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:48.400]  total control of both parties in the executive legislative judicial to a
[2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:52.440]  certain extent and they control the military and the police and they
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:56.360]  control the media and so it's crazy like a fox I mean they're making out like
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:00.560]  bandits oh I don't say it's crazy from a banker's perspective it's perfectly
[2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:05.640]  sensible from a banker's perspective no but from any politicians perspective
[2:27:05.640 --> 2:27:10.200]  yeah we can understand how much they get in the way of campaign contributions but
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:16.960]  this is a superb way to get thrown out of office yes superb way to have your
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:22.880]  reputation destroyed and to have your integrity besmirched is it not a
[2:27:22.880 --> 2:27:31.600]  superb way professor black to also cause a why my republic type situation but I
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:37.160]  think that we'll stop short of by mar this time certainly but if you keep this
[2:27:37.160 --> 2:27:44.240]  up you will take you know in by far the top nation in the world and in the whole
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:50.400]  host of dimensions and you will reduce it to another case of crony capitalism
[2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:56.600]  where you have utter socialism for the rich in the sense of the failed bankers
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:28:03.360]  paid for by all of us and that will be a very bad place to live in so let's all
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:08.840]  work together to prevent it from happening right let's turn this around
[2:28:08.840 --> 2:28:15.200]  now as opposed to waiting for it to become as bad as by mark wow that is
[2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:18.800]  just amazing and I try to explain that to people they're like it's liberal it's
[2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:23.360]  conservative it's socialism it's fascism and I'm like no this is corrupt
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:28.400]  pirates running inside scams bankrupting everything and then having the people
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:33.080]  pay for it when newsweek comes out and says we're all socialist now isn't this
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:37.320]  this is the opposite of socialism this isn't them helicoptering money down the
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:41.960]  people this is helicoptering money to the offshore banks yeah I mean if you
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:48.280]  wanted precedent to be closest to national socialism I guess where they
[2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:52.000]  call it socialism but really just give it all to the inner party yeah it's a
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:57.760]  fascist arrangement and they call it socialist right well we know the Nazi
[2:28:57.760 --> 2:29:01.440]  party called it sells national socialist I'm not comparing either of these
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:07.560]  the Nazis I don't think that's you know that misuse of the phrase that strikes me
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:12.400]  is really diminishing what not these were all about the economic system is
[2:29:12.400 --> 2:29:17.200]  similar but the economic system is I think the best way to describe it is
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:21.760]  crony capitalism yeah and that's a terrible system anybody who's ever
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:27.760]  lived in a nation like that doesn't want to be there okay for the crony
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:32.160]  capitalism okay let's exactly it's good for them nobody else let's come back and
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:36.520]  talk about who's at fault how we bring him to justice so that we can stop them
[2:29:36.520 --> 2:29:41.520]  because they control the political system now if we don't stop them somehow as
[2:29:41.520 --> 2:29:45.960]  you said it's gonna lead to why my republic or I guess in Bob way his book
[2:29:45.960 --> 2:29:50.360]  is the best way to rob a bank is to own one you got to read it folks we really

[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:21.760]  investigator of the SNL's the Keating 5 helps send some of them to jail and they
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:25.200]  got memos out from Keating saying we want to kill this guy kill him dead
[2:33:25.200 --> 2:33:30.520]  clearly very very scary people and a lot of folks ended up getting you know dying
[2:33:30.520 --> 2:33:35.440]  of mysterious deaths and not just here but in Australia and VCCI and Clark
[2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:42.160]  Clifford and that whole CIA front Mr. Black continuing here I want to go back
[2:33:42.160 --> 2:33:46.680]  briefly and then get into who's culpable what Geithner's up to you know how we
[2:33:46.680 --> 2:33:50.200]  stop them because there's this key nexus point as you point out when you got
[2:33:50.200 --> 2:33:55.240]  Paulson you got Geithner it now comes out that even you know before Obama was
[2:33:55.240 --> 2:33:58.400]  elected then after he was elected they were already working with Geithner on
[2:33:58.400 --> 2:34:02.840]  writing up the bailout the banker takeover when he was head of the New York
[2:34:02.840 --> 2:34:08.360]  Fed and you've got the chief of staff a manual from Wall Street and I mean
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:13.320]  literally it's this tight coterie this group of people in there working
[2:34:13.320 --> 2:34:18.800]  together Republicans and Democrats like I've never seen before in modern
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:22.720]  modern history and so but a lot of people's you know email me and say oh
[2:34:22.720 --> 2:34:26.720]  don't bash Obama you know this was Bush that did all this and I'm like yeah Bush
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:32.120]  did it and now Obama's going along with it so can you break down what happened
[2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:38.440]  with the banker bailout and or from your own research is that bipartisan the
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:47.120]  banker bailout is barely bipartisan it it's wrong not even so much frankly
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:55.040]  because of politics directly as because of very very poor creation of the plan
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:35:01.640]  originally by Secretary Paulson and then eventually with the assistance of
[2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:06.040]  Geithner when he was still president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:11.080]  this really wasn't compelled on them by the politicians this is more they are
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:17.160]  so tight with the industry Paulson in particular after all is the guy who came
[2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:23.400]  from Goldman Sachs had run Golden Sachs before became Treasury Secretary had
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:29.800]  gotten Goldman Sachs into toxic waste he's the guy that got them into trouble
[2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:38.720]  with toxic ways then he comes out and AIG is in trouble he appoints a group to
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:45.040]  give him advice and he puts Goldman Sachs his own firm on the advisory panel
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:50.880]  when it has a massive conflict of interest because AIG owes it billions
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:57.000]  and billions of dollars and guess what they advise they advise Paulson to use
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:05.600]  to first to bail out AIG and then to secretly bail out favored banks in in
[2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:13.320]  particular Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs got 12.9 billion dollars the biggest
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:18.480]  single recipient of taxpayer money through this kind of bailout and then
[2:36:18.480 --> 2:36:24.120]  both Paulson and then it continued under the Obama administration Geithner
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:30.800]  tried very hard to make sure that we the public would never learn where that our
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:36.200]  taxpayer dollars had done that what changed that and this is why people
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:41.800]  should not give up was political pressure from Congress and political
[2:36:41.800 --> 2:36:46.000]  pressure not on the administration which was you know let it roll off its back
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:53.240]  like a duck but political pressure on AIG and here's what the mantra was not a
[2:36:53.240 --> 2:37:01.480]  penny more not a penny more of taxpayer money goes to AIG until we know how the
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:07.240]  money has been used and that's pressure on AIG is the only reason we know about
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:12.680]  the Goldman bailout or that the fact that 50 billion dollars roughly of US
[2:37:12.680 --> 2:37:21.400]  taxpayer money went to bail out foreign banks foreign banks why would we do that
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:28.720]  including UBS a massive Swiss bank that at the same time we were bailing them
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:35.080]  out secretly with five billion dollars the US government tells us that UBS was
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:42.360]  involved in defrauding the taxpayers of America we hit them with a huge
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:47.200]  fine you know it's a settlement of seven hundred eighty million dollars but you
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:52.360]  do the math if we gave them five five billion dollars and they paid us seven
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:58.080]  hundred eighty million who really paid the fine the US taxpayers really paid
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:04.200]  that fine yeah we're paying them to steal from us and you've got Bloomberg's
[2:38:04.200 --> 2:38:08.400]  reporting twelve point eight trillion committed and that's almost the gross
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:12.320]  domestic product of the country am I right in saying this is the biggest
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:19.720]  fraud in history oh easily and that's why I think our mantra should be not a
[2:38:19.720 --> 2:38:26.600]  penny more until we have the Korra investigation started the Korra was the
[2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:31.800]  guy experienced prosecutor that we brought in the Great Depression to say
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:39.880]  find out the facts and the Wall Street fat cats hated him detested him bought
[2:38:39.880 --> 2:38:45.000]  him every step of the way but he found the fact he found the widespread brought
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:52.640]  and it led to many of the statutory changes that for 50 years worked so
[2:38:52.640 --> 2:38:58.400]  successfully in America until Wall Street you know finally got enough
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:05.160]  political juice to get rid of the laws and right near the end of the Clinton
[2:39:05.160 --> 2:39:11.440]  administration now on record it was the Clinton people with the Republicans in
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:15.960]  tandem in the 90s that gutted most of this and then George W. Bush was a
[2:39:15.960 --> 2:39:21.120]  happy participant in the run-up to what we see now can you speak specifically to
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:28.160]  that and in your own words is this not a complete hijacking of our entire
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:34.880]  economy by Wall Street well yes I can't speak to that directly and yes it was
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:41.640]  at the they were at the beck and call of the industry the laws passed by
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:49.280]  overwhelming margins but this was very much a Reuben summers and Phil Graham
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:56.560]  working together special to get rid of Glass-Steagall and then the shutting down
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:02.600]  a Brooksley-born when she was trying to regulate these credit default swaps that
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:11.320]  destroyed AIG that again was a summers and Phil Graham working together to
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:17.360]  disagree and they that this is so bizarre they not only passed a law that
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:24.040]  stopped her particular proposed regulation the law said you can't
[2:40:24.040 --> 2:40:33.440]  regulate to protect the beat the taxpayers at all so they are legislating
[2:40:33.440 --> 2:40:38.120]  protection of crime for people that don't understand can you explain what
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:43.080]  tack with what toxic I mean for those that may not be able to grasp it or who
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:46.600]  heard it bandered around the media but don't you know get exactly what it is
[2:40:46.600 --> 2:40:51.640]  can you explain what these toxic toxic waste assets are I mean am I right in
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:59.680]  saying they're just fiat fraudulent Ponzi scheme mining stock in Arizona type
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:05.960]  you know crud that they then have big insurance company certify and then that
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:10.360]  becomes another toxic layer of debt those certifications are then traded and
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:17.120]  and then how many layers in the pyramid you know as these as they nest like like
[2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:22.600]  Russian dolls these frauds within each other I mean this is this is the biggest
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:27.560]  I mean I mean to my mind it's just such in a ridiculous scam on its face well
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:32.880]  you're right that it's layered it isn't typically mining stock you know fake
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:40.680]  mining stock it was typically what we call subprime or liars was the what we
[2:41:40.680 --> 2:41:49.480]  call the underlying and that means in it as it became in truth in 2006 2007
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:54.480]  lending to folks where a very substantial number of the people were
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:42:00.920]  going to fall on the mortgages we're talking you know maybe 25% typically
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:07.120]  default rates on prime mortgages run under 1% to give you a contrast so
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:14.920]  something 25 times as bad roughly and then you had then you did create lots
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:21.040]  of elaborate we call them financial derivatives on top of them some of which
[2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:26.160]  took the form of supposedly being insurance they use the the language of
[2:42:26.160 --> 2:42:31.720]  insurance but in reality they were just pretty much open guarantees that's what
[2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:36.760]  credit default swaps are in reality and you're right that that not only layered
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:42.080]  but if you think about it like those kids games where you you try to stack
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:46.520]  things on top of each other yes and they can hold up and they can hold up they
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:51.400]  start shaking and they become more unwieldy and the bad news is the longer
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:55.240]  it holds together before it collapses the bigger the collapse and the more
[2:42:55.240 --> 2:43:00.760]  damage when it collapses so the old adage of the bigger they are the harder
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:07.200]  they fall yeah well now they don't fall at all right we they're not allowed to
[2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:12.280]  fall I mean the president Obama was asked at press conference now this is
[2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:16.760]  about six weeks ago and he said well you know hardly any banks are in in
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:19.840]  trouble and then he was asked well good are you going to close the ones that are
[2:43:19.840 --> 2:43:26.360]  oh no no we're not going to close any large banks well what happens when you
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:33.280]  give people immunity in advance it causes recklessness
[2:43:33.280 --> 2:43:40.040]  so recklessness if on a good day outright fraud on most days so can you
[2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:44.200]  describe this then if it's not even a Ponzi scheme that's meant to fail now then
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:49.200]  what is it a debt bomb or like a black hole that then is going to suck everything
[2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:54.400]  into it oh no it was a ponzi dynamic you had to grow and grow and grow much more
[2:43:54.400 --> 2:44:00.680]  rapidly which is why people poured on the toxic waste at increasingly fast
[2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:05.920]  rate 2006 2007 but that's what I'm asking this is a Ponzi scheme that then
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:13.720]  blows up and turns into a black hole yeah one institution indie Mac sold 80
[2:44:13.720 --> 2:44:24.640]  billion dollars of liars loans in one year in four and a half years it sold far
[2:44:24.640 --> 2:44:31.360]  more liars loans than the entire savings and loan debacle so indie Mac all by
[2:44:31.360 --> 2:44:38.480]  itself pretty much cost the same as the entire savings and loan debacle see how
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:43.720]  intensifying how much worse it gets if you don't fix the underlying problem so
[2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:47.120]  they knew though I mean all along they knew this was going to implode and then
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:54.240]  and then devastate things we're selling liars loan what was to know no I mean I
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:44:58.560]  understand that parent how more transparent can you get so so clearly
[2:44:58.560 --> 2:45:03.160]  magic coming to the regulators saying hi we've got a new strategic business plan
[2:45:03.160 --> 2:45:10.400]  right what is it we're gonna make fraudulent loans oh okay and so this
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:19.880]  this is key a professor you're saying that I mean just on record that that the
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:24.000]  people that remove these laws because I remember seeing Senator Dornan and others
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:29.920]  say this was gonna happen on the floor but you know he was against it they knew
[2:45:29.920 --> 2:45:33.680]  from setting it up from the Mac from running it up to running it down they
[2:45:33.680 --> 2:45:39.520]  fully knew and this was premeditated no I'm not saying that I'm not I don't know
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:46.200]  that Congress knows I'm telling you that in the trade everybody knew that if you
[2:45:46.200 --> 2:45:51.880]  made something called a liars loan it was because they were fraud overwhelmingly
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:56.200]  and that they was going to produce a disaster now Congress of course is paid
[2:45:56.200 --> 2:46:01.560]  not to know right the bankers don't go in front of Congress and say hi we want
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:07.320]  to produce a disaster please take our money they tell Congress hey we have
[2:46:07.320 --> 2:46:12.640]  this wonderful new thing financial derivatives and everybody which is to
[2:46:12.640 --> 2:46:18.040]  say us you know on Wall Street says this is the greatest thing since sliced
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:24.160]  bread right and everything's going to be wonderful and and we need it because
[2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:29.320]  unless we have it we can't compete with a German massive what are called
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:34.000]  universal banks that can do anything so we have to get rid of every protection
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:38.600]  we've ever put places in place in the United States so that our big banks can
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:44.800]  compete with their giant banks that's how they sold it to Congress but
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:48.160]  obviously somebody in Congress before knew it was bad or it wouldn't have been
[2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:53.760]  illegal previously well yes because we did an investigation and we found the
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:47:02.040]  fact so I urge your listeners to join us in demanding an investigation of what
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:07.320]  caused the problem and of course that we then fix the problem as opposed to
[2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:12.280]  ignore it all right in your own words in after the Great Depression and worked
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:17.480]  for you know a whole two generations of Americans all right well we're gonna get
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:20.600]  into solutions in the final segment coming up but also want folks to get
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:24.720]  your book the best way to rob a bank is to own one by our guest William K. Black
[2:47:24.720 --> 2:47:29.880]  but to mr. Black specifically you've been very critical even though you were
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:35.280]  supporter of Obama of Geithner and others specifically what has Geithner been
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:41.240]  up to I mean isn't he a central figure in all of this absolutely and he is the
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:48.680]  makes it absolutely clear that Obama in this category finance was continuing
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:54.080]  the Paulson panel policies because Geithner was Paulson's right-hand man
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:58.600]  and you would have thought that would have disqualified him but for some
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:03.840]  reason that was viewed as a positive by the Obama administration and so he was
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:09.000]  not only kept on he was promoted to Treasury Secretary and of course he's
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:13.640]  continued these policies and in some ways he's actually made them worse and
[2:48:13.640 --> 2:48:21.400]  that's saying something because the Paulson policies were terrific and then
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:28.280]  Obama comes out and says I'm fighting the CEO bonuses and then it turns out he
[2:48:28.280 --> 2:48:33.320]  wrote the executive order and told Senator Dodd to write the loophole in the
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:40.280]  stimulus package I mean that is that is a new level in arrogant line well and
[2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:45.800]  it's not just that because the press reports also show that Treasury is
[2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:51.800]  currently working behind the scenes with Wall Street to try to exempt them
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:58.000]  effectively from even the existing law that were passed in part over the
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:04.800]  opposition of the Obama administration in the stimulus bill and this again but
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:10.840]  you know don't give up folks in the stimulus bill there was a revolt among
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:17.640]  Democrats and in complete opposition to what President Obama wanted they put
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:23.840]  some restraint on bonuses and compensation into the stimulus bill but
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:28.120]  of course as I said the reports are that the Obama administration is now
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:34.200]  trying to work with Wall Street to help evade those restrictions we need to
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:41.160]  re-energize both sides of the aisle to stop this Mr. Black what does it mean
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:45.480]  when they do these stress tests to the banks and then say to the banks don't
[2:49:45.480 --> 2:49:49.440]  tell the public what we found and then it leaks that the banks are really in
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:54.720]  dire situation oh no it doesn't leak that they're really in dire situation
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:59.640]  they're busy leaking the propaganda that everything's wonderful and it's being
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:06.120]  picked up uncritically in places like Bloomberg and the New York Times as the
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:10.360]  stress tests are a sham and I've said that and you know people can go on the
[2:50:10.360 --> 2:50:16.680]  web sites like naked capitalism and the excerpts of my reasons why it's a sham
[2:50:16.680 --> 2:50:21.400]  I predicted in advance it would be a sham and it's obviously proven to be a sham
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:25.640]  that's my next question where and we're about to break where can people find the
[2:50:25.640 --> 2:50:29.680]  body of your work it's prolific I mean I think by your book and stores but how do

[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:08.360]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[2:54:08.360 --> 2:54:16.200]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network that's
[2:54:16.200 --> 2:54:21.240]  right there is a war on for your mind and we have somebody who's a great captain
[2:54:21.240 --> 2:54:25.560]  for liberty in the fight to get people to open their minds and wake up William
[2:54:25.560 --> 2:54:29.120]  K. Black author of the best shelling wrote it three four years ago and its
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:33.120]  best seller again because he predicted everything was gonna happen the best way
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:37.720]  to rob a bank is to own one be sure and get that because if we don't turn this
[2:54:37.720 --> 2:54:41.680]  around you know that's the big question sir if we don't turn this around and
[2:54:41.680 --> 2:54:49.920]  they just continue the Ponzi schemes that are now getting galactic in size
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:55.360]  where is this leading us well you can only see where it's been leading right
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:55:00.680]  the savings and loan crisis it was a miracle it was contained when it was
[2:55:00.680 --> 2:55:07.120]  because the political pressure there was even more severe than you have here but
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:13.720]  you turned out to have this incredibly brave regulator Ed Gray who took on his
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:19.280]  own administration took on Wall Street and succeeded brilliantly but there's
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:24.400]  been nobody like that in this crisis so you had the savings loan at about a
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:27.680]  hundred and fifty billion then you go over to Russia and they tried out these
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:33.280]  ideas and Russian privatization and it produced massive corruption and the rise
[2:55:33.280 --> 2:55:39.400]  of a few very very rich multi-billionaires many of them connected
[2:55:39.400 --> 2:55:44.440]  with organized crime the oligarchs the oligarchs and it you know when this
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:51.200]  happens look what happens politically in reaction right you get dramatic
[2:55:51.200 --> 2:55:55.720]  political changes as people become infuriated so where did they hit next
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:56:00.640]  they say this was the Washington consensus was their phrase that we knew
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:04.680]  how to run life and it was the way Wall Street said and so they did this
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:09.320]  through Latin America and what it had produced there are ten years of
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:16.320]  stagnation and incredible corruption and giveaways to the biggest you know their
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:20.680]  version of Wall Street and what has happened politically who's getting
[2:56:20.680 --> 2:56:28.080]  elected in Latin America you know people that now intensely hate capitalism
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:34.280]  and the America in reaction well we didn't learn any of those lessons from
[2:56:34.280 --> 2:56:39.000]  any of those crises so we are currently in this one and this one is big enough
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:43.960]  that it's global and it's going to be the most severe recession in the lives
[2:56:43.960 --> 2:56:50.680]  of anybody under the age of 80 we can't afford to repeat it because you don't
[2:56:50.680 --> 2:56:56.240]  just repeat as I've been trying to get across when you don't fix it it doesn't
[2:56:56.240 --> 2:56:59.840]  just repeat it comes back much worse okay we're gonna get a solution to the
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:02.960]  final segment coming up at the moment but made off you talk about organized
[2:57:02.960 --> 2:57:06.360]  crime it's now in the times of London and the Associated Press I'm sure you've
[2:57:06.360 --> 2:57:12.480]  seen it that Cuomo's going after one of Madoff's managers and they're saying
[2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:18.920]  they believe there's organized crime drug money laundering going on in all of
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:24.320]  the really big fraud you're going to find the other thing we haven't talked
[2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:29.640]  about and that is the role of the offshore stuff right which is like UBS we
[2:57:29.640 --> 2:57:34.560]  were talking at the giant Swiss Bank we're very very wealthy people have
[2:57:34.560 --> 2:57:42.960]  paid taxes by putting their money in these tax havens and that always leads to
[2:57:42.960 --> 2:57:47.880]  wide-scale corruption and doesn't it lead to selective enforcement though I
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:52.040]  mean we see Geithner and all them saying they're gonna go after this but then
[2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:56.480]  when you read the fine print it's selectively and that's what the Caimans
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:00.920]  and the Virgin Islands in the Swiss are saying is there any truth to that well
[2:58:00.920 --> 2:58:08.080]  that's certainly true period in other words if you look in the Bush administration
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:14.600]  was particularly terrible on this it largely reoriented its enforcement
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:20.200]  against poor taxpayers and away from rich taxpayers actually what we're trying
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:23.880]  to do on UBS might reverse that event that would be good news we're gonna come
[2:58:23.880 --> 2:58:26.360]  right back I want to finish up with that yeah that's right I remember seeing the
[2:58:26.360 --> 2:58:30.440]  numbers where they took almost all the FBI agents off the billionaire swindlers
[2:58:30.440 --> 2:58:36.920]  and put them on blue collar and white collar you know mid-level stuff it's
[2:58:36.920 --> 2:58:41.760]  just amazing I'm talking about Fox running the henhouse

[2:59:51.160 --> 3:00:12.640]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network I am chopping at
[3:00:12.640 --> 3:00:18.200]  the bit to be there in his law offices in Kansas City at the law school Aaron and
[3:00:18.200 --> 3:00:23.000]  Rob are up there they're about to do an interview with him for TV here in
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:28.360]  Austin and film work we're doing just amazing because I've studied this
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:31.840]  constantly and have all these guests on it into Dr. Mr. Black he just puts it
[3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:36.000]  all together okay you were getting into what I've even seen in the New York Times
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:40.240]  and Washington Post they admit that under Bush they took most the regulators
[3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:46.400]  and most the FBI investigators off the big tax thieves and put them literally on
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:50.840]  mom and pops I mean if that is an open and conscious criminality I mean you
[3:00:50.840 --> 3:00:54.400]  think the government would want these tax revenues can you speak to that yeah
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:01:02.920]  they throw away money it's completely insane they cut the overall number even
[3:01:02.920 --> 3:01:06.800]  though they knew that they would they would cost them more and lost taxes
[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:12.960]  that they would save by not having enough IRS people and then they oriented the
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:19.760]  IRS people overwhelmingly towards not even middle class but actually working
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:26.960]  class Americans so you know it's a spectacular misuse of money it results
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:34.280]  in far less tax dollars being far fewer tax dollars being collected there's
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:38.440]  nobody that can defend it but it's part of the general piece you know white
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:44.840]  color prosecution are down more than 25 percent under the Bush administration
[3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:49.360]  when of course white collar crimes reached an unprecedented level in
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:54.280]  history and now it's accelerating under Obama or I mean are we seeing an
[3:01:54.280 --> 3:01:57.520]  acceleration of that I mean I don't see them changing changing the enforcement
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:03.000]  well we certainly haven't seen it yet talked earlier that they first announced
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:06.880]  that they were actually going to investigate the big lenders which they
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:13.840]  themselves again said were the key frauds two years ago March 2007 not a
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:20.080]  single major indictment so you know maybe they have you know they're having
[3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:24.720]  the most wonderful most secret most successful investigation of all time
[3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:30.200]  and there been no leaks but that doesn't sound like America to me we only got a
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:32.880]  few minutes left sir and then I'll let you take a break into the interview with
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:35.880]  the guys again we're very thankful and have you back up soon because you can't
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:40.760]  do this in an hour in closing what are the solutions I mean for me if we start
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:45.560]  grand jury investigations not just federal but state if we go after more of
[3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:49.880]  these made-off crooks get them to flip and expose a larger system isn't the
[3:02:49.880 --> 3:02:53.960]  quickest way to end this is to have investigations and start arresting people
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:57.040]  I mean won't that won't that point out how this is criminal and needs to be
[3:02:57.040 --> 3:03:03.480]  stopped but you won't get that as long as the failed bankers often the fraudulent
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:09.600]  failed bankers are left in positions of power you need to put honest bankers in
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:16.360]  who will have the incentive and the orders to find where the bodies are
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:21.400]  buried and to make the necessary criminal referrals the FBI cannot do this on
[3:03:21.400 --> 3:03:27.560]  its own so here's an action agenda one start the PCORA investigation immediately
[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:34.000]  two get rid of the bad bankers that caused the failures three put honest
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:40.040]  competent bankers in four find the facts about the assets five make the
[3:03:40.040 --> 3:03:45.440]  appropriate criminal referrals with detailed road maps for the FBI so they
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:51.600]  can make a successful case six indict them seven look for the Achilles heel in
[3:03:51.600 --> 3:03:56.040]  the fraud we don't have remotely enough people we should of course increase
[3:03:56.040 --> 3:04:02.880]  greatly the number of FBI agents but you also have to do like an emergency in
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:07.560]  medicine you have to triage you have to prioritize so go after the rating
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:12.760]  agencies there are only three of them with 20 competent regulators you could
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:20.240]  rip that place out and build it in a competent fresh fashion and without the
[3:04:20.240 --> 3:04:26.360]  triple A rating this crisis couldn't have become a global disaster so there's
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:29.680]  my action agenda very well done and please talk to the guys more detail
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:34.640]  about solutions the problem is though the very corrupt elite that have
[3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:38.400]  engineered this are in control of both parties and the fox is running the
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:43.000]  henhouse so it doesn't look like that's gonna happen does it if we get the facts
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:47.480]  through of the core investigation we will so embarrass them that they will
[3:04:47.480 --> 3:04:51.800]  not be able to block many of these reforms and it is us or them I mean
[3:04:51.800 --> 3:04:55.480]  they're not they're only gonna make it worse we don't do it right that's the
[3:04:55.480 --> 3:04:59.720]  whole history that I just went through all right getting much worse thank you

[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:12.480]  little rascals he's got the got the hairstyle going I but I guess the buck
[3:09:12.480 --> 3:09:19.120]  wheat looks kind of in so I'm I'm like styling here ladies and gentlemen oh my
[3:09:19.120 --> 3:09:29.360]  god give me a faux hawk what's a faux hawk oh oh he's got a faux hawk my god
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:34.640]  ladies and gentlemen business suits have been replaced with faux hawks all
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:42.040]  right 1-800-259-9231 I mean there was a former top federal regulator an
[3:09:42.040 --> 3:09:46.400]  investigator telling you that complete criminals run everything I mean they
[3:09:46.400 --> 3:09:50.800]  consciously are running it the foxes around the henhouse Congress is bank
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:09:54.800]  rolled by these people the Republicans are bankroll by them Obama's bankroll
[3:09:54.800 --> 3:09:59.720]  by them it wouldn't matter who we elected they would have done this but
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:03.120]  they wanted Obama because they decided he could sucker people a little bit
[3:10:03.120 --> 3:10:09.560]  better and that's it period and you know I try to laugh about this but it's not
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:13.040]  funny because your pension funds your police funds your fire funds your
[3:10:13.040 --> 3:10:16.640]  teacher funds your private funds we're all invested in this and they've already
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:20.360]  stolen about half of it and they're gonna steal it all that's what this
[3:10:20.360 --> 3:10:24.680]  hyperinflation means and that's guaranteed with what they've done let me
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:33.760]  run over some of the other headlines here that are very very important this is
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:40.520]  all my global government stack I had yesterday where's the stack I had earlier
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:44.720]  on the show I wanted to go over that I can't keep track of it anymore ladies
[3:10:44.720 --> 3:10:49.880]  and gentlemen it's just well what's happened is and it's even happened to
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:54.200]  me we've all gotten acclimated to live with corruption to live with government
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:59.000]  out of control and corporations out of control and individuals out of control
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:03.800]  and we just put up with more crap than we should and now criminals are just
[3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:08.160]  running over every facet of society I mean it's criminal when the police run a
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:12.480]  checkpoint without warrants but we put up with it it's criminal and they have the
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:16.160]  army out suddenly running checkpoints to acclimate us why do you think they're
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:20.800]  doing all of that because they're going to steal everything and take it off
[3:11:20.800 --> 3:11:24.960]  shore and they know people are gonna riot burn everything down and they're
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:28.560]  gonna march out the cops and military to have gun battles with you when you're
[3:11:28.560 --> 3:11:33.840]  doing it and the banks even bragging their IMF World Bank documents that they
[3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:38.680]  love that because then they get to buy up what's left even cheaper and I'm
[3:11:38.680 --> 3:11:43.760]  saying we don't want this to happen and so I get newspapers attacking me because
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:48.760]  I'm calling for not having violence the establishment is bold they say you want
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:53.080]  to murder cops and I go I just said we don't want this to happen and they go
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:11:58.240]  no you want to murder cops you cause cops to be murdered and I'm going the
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:02.000]  bankers are engineering a collapse they're gonna go after the people's
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:05.280]  guns they've introduced the bills it's gonna be a bloodbath we don't want
[3:12:05.280 --> 3:12:13.400]  violence and they say you know what you're a cop killer see I mean it's like
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:20.720]  this is psychological warfare they mean it to be crazy they mean it to be wild
[3:12:20.720 --> 3:12:25.960]  you know why have they come out in the in the case of one al-Qaeda member and
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:30.440]  claimed he's been killed over 15 times and never retract the last time he was
[3:12:30.440 --> 3:12:37.480]  killed why do they do that they never say he wasn't killed last time chemical
[3:12:37.480 --> 3:12:40.800]  Ali they claimed they killed him four times now they're saying they're gonna
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:44.320]  execute him or something and they would say here he is here's his dead body
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:49.320]  here's the dead bodies of Saddam's sons and then they'd say a month later oh we
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:12:53.440]  killed Saddam's sons again we killed chemical Ali again oh we killed him
[3:12:53.440 --> 3:12:57.880]  again six months later oh we killed him again and they never retract that we
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:03.360]  didn't kill him last time they are practicing being caught as liars openly
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:07.240]  it's a psychological tactic and psychological warfare to just be caught
[3:13:07.240 --> 3:13:10.920]  and it's just and then I remember the first time they said they killed him
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:14.480]  they said oh here's it here's their two dead bodies bombed in a house you can
[3:13:14.480 --> 3:13:18.760]  pull this out and it said they've been reconstructed with wax and clay so
[3:13:18.760 --> 3:13:23.320]  they're recognizable and it's to I mean I could take a ball of clay and make a
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:30.040]  big a better fake head and stick a fake mustache on it and I remember looking at
[3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:34.240]  the pictures on the news and saying those are fake those aren't even people and
[3:13:34.240 --> 3:13:38.640]  then they came out of there's an oh yeah it was reconstructed clay to show what
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:45.280]  their dead bodies look like that was in the news like they came out and said
[3:13:45.280 --> 3:13:50.680]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed bombed all these buildings that were bombed four years
[3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:55.120]  after he was in custody and the news you said that matter he was in custody he
[3:13:55.120 --> 3:14:03.040]  bombed it they just practice evil they just practice lying constantly but
[3:14:03.040 --> 3:14:08.200]  there's millions of other types of deception here's one I'm on the treadmill
[3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:11.320]  this morning for 30 minutes and have enough time to be on there longer and
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:15.880]  I'm watching CNN and Fox I'm putting back and forth and it's Barack Obama's got a
[3:14:15.880 --> 3:14:18.920]  lot of rich Wall Street people in administration but David Gergen a
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:22.520]  Republican says that's a good idea because they're experts to know how to
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:28.520]  fix it and the next piece was he lost his arm in Iraq but he's not even a US
[3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:33.480]  citizen how mean but now he gets to become a US citizen that's meant to make
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:36.480]  you think it's okay that they're converting the majority of the force
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:40.600]  from a big piece to a majority to foreign or illegal aliens from all over
[3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:44.480]  the country all over the world and then I was back there getting some coffee
[3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:49.040]  earlier and it was another piece on another news channel I think was MSM
[3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:53.240]  and we were recording it and I'm seeing the propaganda they got the same report
[3:14:53.240 --> 3:15:00.400]  on another channel this is admittedly fake to where oh I love the foreigners
[3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:03.280]  that make up are they aren't bringing in foreign troops though they've signed
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:06.640]  agreements to use purely foreign armies publicly that didn't a rumor that's
[3:15:06.640 --> 3:15:10.800]  mainstream news public agreements Congress asked last year what are you
[3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:14.280]  doing sign an agreement to use foreign troops in the United States and North
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:20.880]  com said if you read PDD 51 shut up shut up Congress or we'll put you into my
[3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:29.920]  act report we run things now literally don't believe me guys Google it it was
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:33.120]  in the Toronto start a bunch of Canadian papers and I'm in and we ended one US
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:39.040]  paper Google this let me let me call up the exact headline hold on I are close
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:44.680]  don't go to your calls because I keep getting emails saying they're not doing
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:47.280]  deals for foreign troops and I've been to urban warfare drills where they're
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:50.040]  training to have foreign troops take your guns and admitting it's for America
[3:15:50.040 --> 3:15:59.040]  police state 2000 let me think Congress complains about not being notified
[3:15:59.040 --> 3:16:08.960]  about military agreement with Canada and Mexico Congress complains about not
[3:16:08.960 --> 3:16:12.240]  being notified or not being included something like that and you read the
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:17.400]  article it just calmly says oh Canadian Mexican troops signed deals in Canada
[3:16:17.400 --> 3:16:22.200]  today to under North com police the United States during insurrection or
[3:16:22.200 --> 3:16:26.760]  terrorism and then they come out in the Canadian paper and go all the troops are
[3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:30.440]  going to be patrolling to stop drugs on the weekends same thing here we're
[3:16:30.440 --> 3:16:34.680]  stopping drunk driving with the army and they announce it here and the governor
[3:16:34.680 --> 3:16:37.920]  Tennessee says no you're not going to use army on the streets of Tennessee and
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:45.200]  they go oh we aren't go to hell that was last weekend we're all we had a
[3:16:45.200 --> 3:16:49.960]  victory the governor said no and then we learn Monday it's in the newspapers the
[3:16:49.960 --> 3:16:55.200]  army was out with highway shut down quote for over a mile with the army
[3:16:55.200 --> 3:17:01.520]  searching people and then I go look here's the Tennessee newspapers and then
[3:17:01.520 --> 3:17:07.000]  I get national newspapers saying I'm a lying kook and it doesn't exist I mean
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:14.520]  you know it's reached a new level like Obama writing the executive order for
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:18.040]  the bonuses and then getting on TV saying I'm gonna stop the bonuses I'm
[3:17:18.040 --> 3:17:24.000]  outraged I mean they've introduced all these bills to basically ban guns in
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:27.920]  America unlimited banning is what the one of the bills gives you and then they
[3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:34.040]  just say to us your liars I mean I have newspaper reporters calling me going
[3:17:34.040 --> 3:17:37.080]  why are you putting out this disinformation Obama wants the guns and
[3:17:37.080 --> 3:17:40.000]  I go well let me give you some bill numbers no no I'm not interested in

[3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:06.760]  in the new world orders war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the
[3:22:06.760 --> 3:22:12.080]  spear we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[3:22:12.080 --> 3:22:16.480]  think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:20.440]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people. Well
[3:22:20.440 --> 3:22:25.080]  Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election. If you have a
[3:22:25.080 --> 3:22:29.240]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[3:22:29.240 --> 3:22:34.520]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[3:22:34.520 --> 3:22:41.000]  that's fascism. It's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:47.720]  this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his real agenda

[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:38.800]  fun I apologize I need to be more serious let's just go to your phone
[3:24:38.800 --> 3:24:44.720]  calls right now as promised Joe in New Mexico sir you're on the air welcome
[3:24:44.720 --> 3:24:49.920]  Alex I'm getting kind of frustrated here and I was listening to that William
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:56.480]  Black interview with you and I went I watched his lawyers get people got to
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:25:01.440]  go back and watch the third segment on that this guy is he's holding back you
[3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:05.680]  know you you are a true seeker this guy's pull in my opinion he's pulling
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:13.400]  him back and the reason why I say that Alex is he talks about how these guys
[3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:18.040]  have good intentions and they were just frankly scared and that's why they did
[3:25:18.040 --> 3:25:21.000]  the bailouts you know ask him what's up with the
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:26.680]  wall moon JP Morgan a solvent entity being sucked up by JP well I mean I mean
[3:25:26.680 --> 3:25:31.000]  he's on this show saying that they engineered the thing knowing it would
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:34.680]  collapse in their criminals I mean you know he's one of the strongest voices
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:40.560]  out there at his level he is but Alex forget the guy is holding back he's
[3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:46.680]  either he knows more he knows a lot more and and I just wonder why he's
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:52.120]  scared or holding back he's not like you he doesn't go full blur and say these
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:56.760]  are the facts you can you can just see it he there's more to this and I think
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:01.200]  he's he's pulling a Glenn Beck and he's desensitizing people on the issue and
[3:26:01.200 --> 3:26:07.200]  and it's kind of following I'm saying you know I'm just frustrated now I hear
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:10.120]  you but instead of worrying about the bankers taking over everything that's
[3:26:10.120 --> 3:26:13.840]  happening and admitting they're chemtrailing us now just deny it all
[3:26:13.840 --> 3:26:17.120]  you know because you don't want them to say you were a tenfold hat I mean the
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:21.560]  governments of all ways it's like the tea parties Alex they're talking about
[3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:27.520]  taxation problems to speak in fellow reserve no no I agree but but listen more
[3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:32.520]  and more it's a process more and more at those tea party meetings they are
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:36.120]  talking about the private fellow reserve of the New World Order so what's
[3:26:36.120 --> 3:26:39.640]  happening is that's the reason Fox News is having to at least pay lip service to
[3:26:39.640 --> 3:26:44.800]  FEMA camps in New World Order and global currency now is because conservatives
[3:26:44.800 --> 3:26:47.960]  libertarians and liberals have been woken up by people like you and I and
[3:26:47.960 --> 3:26:51.600]  many others and so they've lost all credibility so you even hear a lot of
[3:26:51.600 --> 3:26:56.600]  this stuff on CNBC and CNN now so they understand that we're effective so
[3:26:56.600 --> 3:27:01.360]  folks you know you you should feel good to a certain extent that we've been able
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:04.920]  to reach as many people as we've had been able to but I appreciate your call
[3:27:04.920 --> 3:27:13.080]  will in Louisiana will you're on the air hi I first want to introduce sir what
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:22.240]  I think planned by the IMF with the with the synthetic currency loans and how
[3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:30.160]  they plan to deface or devalue the currency yes go ahead what they're
[3:27:30.160 --> 3:27:37.360]  planning to do is is take this currency loans let's say the United States loans
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:45.760]  Japanese and then they pay us back that loan with Japanese yen in their exchange
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:49.880]  rate so they don't have to hold American dollars so there's no such thing as
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:53.360]  exchange rate hundreds of newspapers haven't announced that there's a world
[3:27:53.360 --> 3:27:58.880]  government everything is fine I mean you know no one's ever wanted to rule the
[3:27:58.880 --> 3:28:02.400]  world there aren't global elites the council on foreign relations and
[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:06.800]  literally hundreds of documents just in the last few years you know hasn't
[3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:11.720]  called for global governance I mean they actually have but international
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:15.680]  institutions and global governance program world order 21st century May
[3:28:15.680 --> 3:28:20.200]  1st 2008 with David Rockefeller saying they're going to engineer planetary
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:25.160]  takeover by the UN by a world depression I mean that doesn't exist sir and if you
[3:28:25.160 --> 3:28:29.880]  think it exists if you think the CFR exists well then you're an orange monkey
[3:28:29.880 --> 3:28:34.680]  wearing a tinfoil hat that's that's all I can really say they don't have to
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:38.920]  hold American dollars now they can just pay us back in but see according to the
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:43.880]  yuppies none of this even exists so why does it even matter and they got
[3:28:43.880 --> 3:28:48.640]  touch on one thing the collateralized debt obligations sure go ahead and how
[3:28:48.640 --> 3:28:52.360]  they don't have to pay tax if they're a multinational they don't they're exempt
[3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:58.720]  from certain taxes yes I don't know I mean they pay less than 1% tax so taxes
[3:28:58.720 --> 3:29:02.120]  is for little people that's why the IRS has its investigators going to folks
[3:29:02.120 --> 3:29:07.520]  making 20 grand a year and I'll go after folks making a billion a year go
[3:29:07.520 --> 3:29:11.960]  ahead basically that's all I wanted to touch I wanted to touch on those
[3:29:11.960 --> 3:29:17.440]  synthetic currency loans and the more more more information needs to be looked
[3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:21.440]  into on the tax structure within these derivatives and these collateralized
[3:29:21.440 --> 3:29:28.720]  debt obligations yeah no you're right and they're already issuing the global
[3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:33.000]  currency and they admit that major papers but again that doesn't exist
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:36.560]  according to the yuppies who are actually a brainwash cult of nuts they're
[3:29:36.560 --> 3:29:39.960]  the tinfoil hatwares they believe the false reality because they're such
[3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:43.280]  cowards and that's why they're gonna lose everything they've got but even
[3:29:43.280 --> 3:29:45.440]  when they lose everything they've got there's such cowards they're still
[3:29:45.440 --> 3:29:48.200]  gonna worship the government and feel like they're members of the
[3:29:48.200 --> 3:29:51.560]  establishment and the government's gonna point them like a dangerous whore to

[3:33:42.440 --> 3:33:45.560]  going on they're not really communists they're criminals that tell the dumb
[3:33:45.560 --> 3:33:49.400]  down public we're here to give you money a workers paradise and the first thing
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:53.480]  they do is steal all the money instead of a police state but read them for folks
[3:33:53.480 --> 3:33:57.320]  who are on the radio who can't see that on screen at prisonplanet.tv what it
[3:33:57.320 --> 3:34:03.200]  says so it's a pictures an editorial cartoon and it's got a guy his name is
[3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:08.520]  I can't even read it now but he's a they're all in a Harvard type graduate
[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:12.440]  uniforms and they're running down on this this cart and they're shoveling money
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:19.280]  out of it and and then over here this is I guess Karl Marx is a plant of
[3:34:19.280 --> 3:34:24.680]  action for us spin spin spin under the guise of recovery bust the government
[3:34:24.680 --> 3:34:28.800]  blame the capitalists for the failure junk the Constitution and declare a
[3:34:28.800 --> 3:34:35.240]  dictatorship and it says young has a thing here says young pinkies from
[3:34:35.240 --> 3:34:39.480]  Columbia and Harvard depleting the resources of the soundest government in
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:45.400]  the world this is from 1933 and there it is on on there absolutely and I printed
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:50.040]  the article it's here in my stack what is it 49% I'm going from every let me
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:55.920]  get it 49% of Americans say they want socialism because they've been sold on
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:35:00.160]  that means you get the rich people's money no that means the rich people with
[3:35:00.160 --> 3:35:05.000]  the IRS take you have you mow lawns for a living's money and that's what we just
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:08.760]  covered earlier with professor black and they and they give it to offshore
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:15.000]  banks and this is not socialism and socialism never exists elites always
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:19.080]  the big foundations the big money push it because they want to steal what you've
[3:35:19.080 --> 3:35:26.000]  got and feed it right into their gaping mouths guys pull up that info wars com
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:31.160]  headline it was like history repeating itself yeah it's out of a major a major
[3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:39.520]  major polling agency did it and 49% and I love the graphic demo put up for the
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:42.840]  story it's a it's a picture I'm gonna get a t-shirt out of this it's a picture of a
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:50.760]  guy with a in blue no one read with a gun up to a guy in a blues head who's got
[3:35:50.760 --> 3:35:55.200]  the bag of money in his hands there's a socialism that's all it is but that's
[3:35:55.200 --> 3:35:58.840]  my point on that now we got a lot of exciting stuff happening activists if
[3:35:58.840 --> 3:36:02.600]  you want to be in the new obama film get the obama deception it is the new film
[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:07.440]  right now but on July 4th a new obama film is coming out and then I'm gonna
[3:36:07.440 --> 3:36:10.080]  take a rest from that for a while but it's so important to discredit him and
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:13.840]  show he's a fraud we're doing that we're sending folks and I've asked me to
[3:36:13.840 --> 3:36:17.960]  speak but I don't know if I'm gonna go April 19th up at Lexington in
[3:36:17.960 --> 3:36:21.720]  Massachusetts where the Revolutionary War started in 1775 with the gun
[3:36:21.720 --> 3:36:25.040]  confiscation today they would just come take the guns and say we're not taking
[3:36:25.040 --> 3:36:29.000]  your guns but we're taking them and then the and the Patriots the founders
[3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:32.720]  would have said oh yes you're taking my guns at gunpoint but you're not taking
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:36.160]  my guns you know but they weren't mind-control drinking fluoride then so
[3:36:36.160 --> 3:36:39.360]  it wouldn't work so we're gonna have cameras up there you're going to that we
[3:36:39.360 --> 3:36:44.600]  can't be everywhere shoot video of tea parties so I want to show the solution
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:48.920]  the activism while red will put a little vignette exposing back yeah as an
[3:36:48.920 --> 3:36:51.920]  operative but tell folks about some of the great ideas listeners have and I'm
[3:36:51.920 --> 3:36:56.720]  going to calls yeah we got an email from a group in Arizona State University
[3:36:56.720 --> 3:37:02.040]  Obama speaking there on the 13th of of May and they're gonna pass out and I
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:05.560]  saw they showed the boxes of the obama deceptions they've been copying they're
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:09.640]  gonna pass out 10,000 copies of the Obama deception at the commencement
[3:37:09.640 --> 3:37:14.160]  speech which that's a great idea guys and I think we're inviting I invited the
[3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:17.640]  one guys who started this on the show I sent him an email that will devastate
[3:37:17.640 --> 3:37:23.040]  them and again you can do this cheaply now because at prisonplanet.tv you can
[3:37:23.040 --> 3:37:26.840]  download DivEx copies that play on almost all the new DVD players and put the
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:30.520]  film in pretty good quality it's not DVD quality but it's close you can blow up on
[3:37:30.520 --> 3:37:33.280]  the screen it looks you know it's nice it's not crystal clear like the you know
[3:37:33.280 --> 3:37:37.040]  high-quality DVD folks can get but point is you can burn them to disc those
[3:37:37.040 --> 3:37:40.440]  things cost like 20 cents a piece yeah and put them in paper sleeves and so
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:49.160]  what's what's 10,000 times 20 cents oh that's two two thousand dollars is that
[3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:55.360]  right yeah yeah you're good and then more fluoride yeah able to do that okay
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:37:59.760]  I was wrong I knew I was going for memory just 53% say capitalism better than
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:06.360]  socialism so 47% I just need to find the poll because I'm reading wrong the point
[3:38:06.360 --> 3:38:12.480]  is only 53% that's the headline say capitalism better than socialism that's
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:15.360]  because they're being manipulated about what socialism really means that's
[3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:21.440]  probably the people that just have jobs 53% anyway also the hostage dies as
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:25.120]  French attacks Somali pirates this isn't the same ship that we were talking
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:30.160]  about but French hostage and two pirates died Friday in a rescue operation
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:34.360]  off Somali's coastline the French president's office in Paris said Friday
[3:38:34.360 --> 3:38:38.880]  four hostages including a child were freed from the hijacked yacht after
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:43.800]  almost a week in captivity Nicholas Sarkozy's office said so they they
[3:38:43.800 --> 3:38:48.760]  decided to move in when pirates refused their offers and and one hostage died
[3:38:48.760 --> 3:38:52.720]  and they killed two pirates so things are getting out of control okay thank you
[3:38:52.720 --> 3:38:57.320]  so much Rob do keep kicking a new world or honey there okay who's up next here
[3:38:57.320 --> 3:39:07.200]  John we should I go to next Daniel and Alabama sir welcome he's listening to
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:12.040]  us radio yes sir okay I'm here hey how you doing I'm doing alright sir first I
[3:39:12.040 --> 3:39:16.440]  want to say God bless you and thank you for all your hard work the one thing I
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:20.600]  wanted to touch on you something about the gun control holder and Pelosi and I
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:24.360]  am they've got another ploy I don't know how it is in other parts of the
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:30.160]  country but I know down here it's getting hard as toenails to get ammunition
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:34.640]  oh yeah well I mean it will see they put all these rules and harassment with
[3:39:34.640 --> 3:39:38.640]  regulators on the ammo companies and the military has been stockpiling and
[3:39:38.640 --> 3:39:42.840]  hoarding way over the amount they need that is confirmed and the military
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:51.680]  historically would always sell the brass of the 45 of the 223 of the 308 of the
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:56.200]  nine millimeter to the major ammo companies they've now under order of
[3:39:56.200 --> 3:40:02.040]  Obama refused to sell the millions and millions of rounds a month to well the
[3:40:02.040 --> 3:40:10.600]  casings to complete the entire cartridge to the Liberty Hill blog and they were
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:13.200]  talking about how Congress had shot all that down I don't believe that I'm gonna
[3:40:13.200 --> 3:40:17.480]  tell you why up here at the local Walmart my daughter one do some target
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:20.920]  shooting and she was out of shells for her 22 and they had told us they were
[3:40:20.920 --> 3:40:24.880]  gonna get in a big shipment and then three days before the shipment supposed
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:30.480]  to come in they tell us they canceled it I mean it's getting that bad you can't
[3:40:30.480 --> 3:40:35.840]  even get shells for 22 down here I know and they've been denying denying denying
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:38.880]  they go we don't want your guns and I've seen the YouTube clip we're trying to
[3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:43.400]  find it earlier and couldn't somebody email us this is what he says word for
[3:40:43.400 --> 3:40:47.720]  it he says listen we're not gonna ban all your guns overnight we're gonna do it
[3:40:47.720 --> 3:40:52.000]  in steps and we have a right under the Second Amendment to restrict your gun
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:56.200]  ownership that's what it means I mean I've got the video I've seen it of him
[3:40:56.200 --> 3:41:01.920]  saying that but regardless we have we have the the state law he tried to pass
[3:41:01.920 --> 3:41:07.480]  in in Illinois to ban all handguns and he and he supported the DC gunman for
[3:41:07.480 --> 3:41:11.720]  total ban of citizens and now they've introduced the bills and now Pelosi says
[3:41:11.720 --> 3:41:15.760]  they want national registration that means a fine and a fee every year to
[3:41:15.760 --> 3:41:19.600]  have your your your gun it's really a fine and that you've got to go through
[3:41:19.600 --> 3:41:23.840]  federal licensing and that turns a right into a privilege they are now pushing
[3:41:23.840 --> 3:41:28.960]  it and I wanted to make but I because I don't want to hold you long I know
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:33.560]  there's got to be colors to go ahead to get through but uh what I also wanted to
[3:41:33.560 --> 3:41:36.880]  say was that you know people don't believe that the UN is involved in all
[3:41:36.880 --> 3:41:41.080]  this I haven't on good authority because I saw this with my own eyes our own
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:44.560]  national and state parks have been deeded over to the UN they don't even
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:49.840]  belong to us anymore oh sir that's executive order 12,986 I made my first
[3:41:49.840 --> 3:41:56.800]  film in 97 about that America destroyed by design and the UN came to the
[3:41:56.800 --> 3:42:00.400]  Kentucky legislature and told them under IMF World Bank rules that they
[3:42:00.400 --> 3:42:03.720]  basically run to their control and the legislature said no and kicked them out
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:07.640]  but now they admit I'm sure you've it's been confirmed China's demanded our
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:13.000]  lands and roads for collateral on the debt and it just came in today that was
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:19.760]  in my stack Congress did pass the bill to a company Bush's executive order of
[3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:25.000]  last year to hand all the infrastructure including the roads over to the
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:29.880]  foreigners they do this in third world nations here it is Senate votes to end
[3:42:29.880 --> 3:42:34.400]  moratorium and sell off our highways to foreign toll operators bills now going
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:39.480]  to the house and this is out of the Texas Senate I got another one of the
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:44.280]  feds voted 29 to 2 in favor of reauthorizing private toll contracts
[3:42:44.280 --> 3:42:48.200]  essentially sell our highways the highest bidder so there you go I
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:52.840]  appreciate your calls sir yeah and again it's all about lying with these
[3:42:52.840 --> 3:42:57.960]  criminals they came out two months ago and said so people shut up with the
[3:42:57.960 --> 3:43:02.040]  legislative session they had they said look trans-Texas corridor and after
[3:43:02.040 --> 3:43:08.720]  highway is dead AP headline and then three paragraphs down back pull that up
[3:43:08.720 --> 3:43:14.560]  trans-Texas corridors dead in dozens of publications and similar headlines and
[3:43:14.560 --> 3:43:19.600]  then paragraph paragraphs down it says but they're gonna break the project up
[3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:24.000]  into subgroups and just give it new names the whole thing continues and then
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:28.920]  Indiana Texas New Jersey Florida they'll take a roads that say is worth
[3:43:28.920 --> 3:43:33.520]  30 billion over the next 50 years in the lease they'll say 1 billion you get it
[3:43:33.520 --> 3:43:38.680]  and then they run a scam where they then use taxpayer money to actually upkeep
[3:43:38.680 --> 3:43:44.000]  the roads and the bankers give nothing yeah look at this trans-Texas corridor
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:48.280]  is dead Dallas morning news click on it put it up on screen for me I can read it

[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:41.200]  listen on several things I was trying to reach you the other day I hope you guys
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:47.600]  you guys got it when they were talking about the the whole thing with the
[3:44:47.600 --> 3:44:53.760]  electric grid that's cyber the cyber thing yes where they said they've got a
[3:44:53.760 --> 3:44:58.240]  control the web and be able to shut it off because the Chinese it that's the
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:03.360]  legislation but I sent a I tried to email you the link because I couldn't
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:08.240]  believe this you were on there and I was trying to call in and they had on CNBC
[3:45:08.240 --> 3:45:11.680]  I'm a stockbroker of 22 years so we've been working on Wall Street for 22 years
[3:45:11.680 --> 3:45:18.560]  and any rate they are on CNBC at 12 o'clock 4 p.m. they turn around that
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:23.160]  they're all of a sudden a flash of cyber spies are in the in the works from
[3:45:23.160 --> 3:45:28.920]  either China or Russia to set shut down the electric grid you know this is all
[3:45:28.920 --> 3:45:33.560]  in line with no I did see it was legislation no I did see it and they're
[3:45:33.560 --> 3:45:38.220]  saying that China and Russia are doing it through the internet and so he says we
[3:45:38.220 --> 3:45:42.560]  must get rid of the internet that's a quote from Jay Rockefeller because of
[3:45:42.560 --> 3:45:46.560]  this and again right as there's bill is introduced right as they're taking the
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:50.400]  web over mother Jones admits it so they can kill it in their own words for our
[3:45:50.400 --> 3:45:56.840]  safety the the Chinese and Russians attack around blame somebody else when
[3:45:56.840 --> 3:46:00.680]  it was them themselves I mean it makes me sick because I've never believed any
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:04.520]  of this stuff to tell you the truth I mean like this last July a year ago July
[3:46:04.520 --> 3:46:08.040]  I went down to Washington DC and saw Ron Paul went down did the march down
[3:46:08.040 --> 3:46:13.200]  there and you know none of that got on the air but that was that was pretty
[3:46:13.200 --> 3:46:18.520]  interesting but one of the things I thought was amazing was back in you
[3:46:18.520 --> 3:46:22.600]  know September 11th when that took place I worked at one pen plaza was up on the
[3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:25.880]  41st floor I watched the whole thing from my office I couldn't believe what I
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:29.880]  saw and you know it was like for me I was sitting there going you know I can't
[3:46:29.880 --> 3:46:32.840]  believe this I mean walking out of the office at 11 o'clock was the last one of
[3:46:32.840 --> 3:46:36.240]  the last ones to leave the building push the elevator button and I got to tell
[3:46:36.240 --> 3:46:39.680]  you this thought popped into my head and the thought was basically here you know
[3:46:39.680 --> 3:46:43.680]  the Israel's got the United States in its back pocket now and that was back
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:51.440]  then you know so it was just just just tripped out I mean this whole thing
[3:46:51.440 --> 3:46:56.200]  going forward and one of the other things I wanted to mention was that you
[3:46:56.200 --> 3:47:00.200]  know this whole thing with the CDOs and the collapse of the financial system
[3:47:00.200 --> 3:47:05.760]  that we've had been witnessing here I mean you know 22 years ago Michael
[3:47:05.760 --> 3:47:11.920]  Millican created you know junk bonds and the junk bond that he created 22 years
[3:47:11.920 --> 3:47:17.280]  ago literally you know wiped out the savings and loans the threats the
[3:47:17.280 --> 3:47:21.560]  insurance companies etc etc all the way up you took the market down from 87 to
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:28.920]  91 this stuff that's going on today it's the same thing it's no different
[3:47:28.920 --> 3:47:34.120]  absolutely and and by engaging in the financial terrorism saying we were gonna
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:37.360]  have a depression that destroyed confidence and then hit all the
[3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:41.360]  legitimate real stocks so they can depress it and suck it up and they
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:46.160]  write white papers about how they do this yeah what's happening here now
[3:47:46.160 --> 3:47:51.360]  Alex is that when if you go back to Michael Millican okay to me that was
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:55.920]  like a test balloon you know it was like here let's see if this works you know
[3:47:55.920 --> 3:47:59.560]  let's throw this out there let's see if this works and they saw that it did work
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:03.000]  and now it's like you know 22 years later they turn out there say okay here
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:07.400]  we're gonna come up with these CDO CDS's etc etc etc we're gonna sell them all
[3:48:07.400 --> 3:48:10.560]  around the world and basically what that is is I don't know if you're
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:13.280]  familiar with the collateralized mortgage obligation but the bottom line is
[3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:17.600]  that what these guys would do is they they they take a loan and then they
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:21.400]  break it up into various different pieces or what's known as tranches and
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:25.440]  they claim it has value and they claim it's certified and sell it as an asset
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:29.640]  when it's a debt imagine this what they did if they went in with a went another
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:35.120]  step further now they turn around they do fractional banking on all these assets
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:39.120]  oh yeah they sell them repackage them sell them repackage them sell them
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:42.840]  repackage them sell them repackage them over and over and over again so you're
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:47.880]  not talking about you know a one trillion dollar problem a 12 trillion
[3:48:47.880 --> 3:48:52.560]  dollar problem some of the numbers I've seen are like a quadrillion and a half
[3:48:52.560 --> 3:48:57.400]  dollars no I that's what the experts we've talked to have said because they
[3:48:57.400 --> 3:49:00.480]  would they would leverage banks and insurance companies and everybody
[3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:04.600]  engaging in fractional banking and create new banks with seed money from
[3:49:04.600 --> 3:49:07.320]  that and then they would leverage leverage leverage leverage leverage seven
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:10.200]  times and then leverage leverage leverage and create another bank and then
[3:49:10.200 --> 3:49:13.320]  leverage leverage leverage leverage and then they buy up the planet and then
[3:49:13.320 --> 3:49:18.160]  say you're our slaves now SWAT teams there are slaves and the cops go that's
[3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:21.400]  right bankers say we you they have the money good to hear from you sir really
[3:49:21.400 --> 3:49:28.560]  appreciate it bill let's talk to Matt in Texas Matt you're on the air welcome who
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:36.840]  again yes Matt welcome all right okay I had a had a question you know the tea
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:45.400]  parties and everything well I've gotten into that a little we call ours
[3:49:45.400 --> 3:49:51.200]  Americans for integrity in government oh that sounds evil sounds evil I'm
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:56.720]  being sarcastic oh yeah freedom integrity oh my god government doesn't
[3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:03.280]  like that but you know we are so far behind in education I think in what we
[3:50:03.280 --> 3:50:10.880]  know as far as you know I'm Republican Democrat we're pitted against each other
[3:50:10.880 --> 3:50:24.080]  and and I just I'm kind of I'd like to be able to you know offer a way to you
[3:50:24.080 --> 3:50:30.040]  know be educated and take action at the same time we that's what we want to do I
[3:50:30.040 --> 3:50:36.080]  mean and these people you know we're it's I would say most of them are
[3:50:36.080 --> 3:50:44.480]  Republicans but we you know we're trying not to be a Republican you know I
[3:50:44.480 --> 3:50:47.680]  agree that's healthy well I mean you know it was mostly Democrats against
[3:50:47.680 --> 3:50:51.080]  Bush and that's mostly Republicans against Obama it's the partisanship in
[3:50:51.080 --> 3:50:54.960]  its very nature but we've got it that's what the Obama deception does as it
[3:50:54.960 --> 3:50:59.160]  shows you they're all paid for we got to arrest the bankers that's the key you
[3:50:59.160 --> 3:51:04.960]  want a solution arrest the crooks with our economy spiraling out of control
[3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:09.160]  living in the soup kitchens maybe right around the corner no one saw the
[3:51:09.160 --> 3:51:13.760]  financial collapse of 1929 many didn't make it and millions ended up in
[3:51:13.760 --> 3:51:20.120]  soup lines becoming vagrants begging for food unlike 1929 we can see this
[3:51:20.120 --> 3:51:24.760]  collapse coming we have been warned and right now we have a very small window
[3:51:24.760 --> 3:51:29.400]  of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late too late
[3:51:29.400 --> 3:51:33.520]  why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up why and why
[3:51:33.520 --> 3:51:37.560]  are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage supplies
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:41.520]  are running low having food storage today may be just as important to your
[3:51:41.520 --> 3:51:45.960]  family's survival as boarding the arc was in the days of Noah order right now
[3:51:45.960 --> 3:51:50.760]  and receive free shipping and all when your supplies go to your food storage
[3:51:50.760 --> 3:52:04.040]  dot-com that's your food storage dot-com or call 877-482-FOOD that's 877-482-F-O-O-D today in the new world orders war
[3:52:04.040 --> 3:52:09.280]  against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a

[3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:16.760]  information also putting up with me
[3:54:19.640 --> 3:54:27.000]  you know I'm normally a lot calmer the last few months on air but I'm kind of
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:30.560]  a loser in ways I go back and forth smoking cigarettes not smoking cigarettes
[3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:34.400]  the problem is every time I quit smoking cigarettes start really exercising a lot
[3:54:34.400 --> 3:54:39.960]  I get crazed even more than normal so I've been like that lately I'm gonna go
[3:54:39.960 --> 3:54:44.160]  jogging right now when I get off air to hopefully settle down so that's one
[3:54:44.160 --> 3:54:46.760]  reason I've been a little bit more obnoxious lately this week but I know
[3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:49.840]  it's made for interesting radio listening but you know this stuff is so real
[3:54:49.840 --> 3:54:54.240]  folks it's hard to get your mind around it's hard to deal with a few of the
[3:54:54.240 --> 3:54:57.280]  I'm gonna take a few final calls I'm tempted to go into overdrive just so we
[3:54:57.280 --> 3:55:00.320]  can take all the calls that are here but I'm not gonna do it we'll be back

[3:55:03.640 --> 3:55:08.120]  grows because you spread the word about it and as we reach more people as we
[3:55:08.120 --> 3:55:11.480]  educate more people we have a better chance of bringing these criminals to
[3:55:11.480 --> 3:55:15.280]  justice again it's very bold and criminal what the globalists are doing
[3:55:15.280 --> 3:55:18.240]  and if we can just get the folks to realize they have power and that they
[3:55:18.240 --> 3:55:22.400]  have a chance to affect things and that their interests is to stand up and
[3:55:22.400 --> 3:55:27.160]  say no and get past the left right distraction we can fix this one of the

[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:49.320]  several things they're actually a very high importance on the list that I want
[3:56:49.320 --> 3:56:53.480]  to bring up I think I'm going to start off with the first being the NIAC
[3:56:53.480 --> 3:56:57.680]  document which has been posted to the prison planet forum by one of the
[3:56:57.680 --> 3:57:02.300]  moderators known as anti-illuminati now being that I mean when we have the
[3:57:02.300 --> 3:57:09.680]  Mayak report that we want we broke not my act not an M and the national the
[3:57:09.680 --> 3:57:20.920]  NAS information architecture committee okay this report is the exact detailed
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:30.720]  report of how they integrated the DOD systems directly with the FAA okay so
[3:57:30.720 --> 3:57:33.920]  that it went from being a one-way communication terminal in which they
[3:57:33.920 --> 3:57:38.960]  could only pull data to being able to push data the culmination of this
[3:57:38.960 --> 3:57:44.240]  project and the sheer importance of this was demonstrated in loose change
[3:57:44.240 --> 3:57:50.560]  second edition when NASA flies that jet by remote control over ILS and after
[3:57:50.560 --> 3:57:58.200]  landing it and taking it off is able to then use this system to completely get
[3:57:58.200 --> 3:58:03.440]  rid of all of the security and safety mechanisms in place in ILS to crash
[3:58:03.440 --> 3:58:07.440]  well let me stop you yes I was aware remember when Bush was in a press
[3:58:07.440 --> 3:58:11.200]  conference in New York and he says hey don't worry no more hijack is we got a
[3:58:11.200 --> 3:58:14.840]  remote control system that'll be able to we'll be able to stop the planes and he
[3:58:14.840 --> 3:58:19.760]  literally the guy by him grabs his arm and he's like stop it pop it and then
