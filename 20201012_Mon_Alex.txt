[00:00.000 --> 00:12.880]  It's Monday, October 12th. The year is 2020. We are 21 days out from the most historic
[00:12.880 --> 00:22.000]  election in world history. We are 100 days out, ladies and gentlemen, until the inauguration.
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.800]  I am your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be live here for the next four hours. This
[00:26.800 --> 00:33.040]  is the most demonized, most attacked, most lied about transmission in the world by the forces
[00:33.040 --> 00:39.760]  of evil. The forces of good and pro-human justice love our broadcast and you keep us on the air.
[00:39.760 --> 00:45.600]  I salute you all. You know, I've got so much news to cover, so many angles. I want to take calls.
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.080]  I've got a bunch of special guests. I'll tell you about that next segment. But I really think we
[00:50.080 --> 00:54.880]  should just open up the transmission with this, because when you see a semantical headline,
[00:54.880 --> 01:01.360]  what's really behind that headline? And we could talk for several hours just about this one headline
[01:02.960 --> 01:08.160]  of a video clip I'm about to play. Bill Maher on Friday night with his program
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.280]  confronts Adam Schiff about mass exodus from California.
[01:15.360 --> 01:22.880]  But it's not a mass exodus from California. People aren't mass exiting the topography
[01:22.880 --> 01:30.160]  of the beaches of the climate. There's an exodus from leftist, globalist, chai-com, looting,
[01:30.160 --> 01:36.880]  and control. That's what people are engaged in, is an exodus away from the left.
[01:38.160 --> 01:41.840]  And even Obama and Biden say, oh, too many people are fleeing the big cities,
[01:42.720 --> 01:49.200]  brown, black, white. It doesn't matter. It's racist. We need to have a gender 21 and go out and take
[01:49.200 --> 01:54.400]  over local towns and cities and a smaller hamlets and make them go under our control.
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.400]  This is mismanagement by design to bankrupt and annihilate the country.
[02:01.200 --> 02:06.720]  Communist China is the main partner of the globalist, and they write the script on how Americans
[02:06.720 --> 02:12.400]  are treated. And as Americans realize this, they're not just going to leave California
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.240]  and take their values with them. Some will. But the majority of Californians and others I'm talking to
[02:18.240 --> 02:24.000]  are fully rejecting the values. And I can tell you, I don't live in the super elite part of Boston.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.920]  I live in a nice area. And I just see teeny stars, movie stars, famous people,
[02:30.880 --> 02:38.080]  politicians, inventors, well-known individuals everywhere now. And they all say everyone they know
[02:39.040 --> 02:46.080]  is leaving California, New York, Virginia. They're Michigan. But there's a lot of, again,
[02:46.080 --> 02:51.840]  common folks as well. So there's a massive, massive exodus again, just like we fled Europe,
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.560]  some of our ancestors to get away from tyranny. We recreated our own tyranny here, but lesser so.
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.240]  And so there's always that exodus out of Pharaoh's Egypt, that exodus out of Sodom and Gomorrah,
[03:02.240 --> 03:08.240]  that exodus out of California. But it's an exodus away from the spirit of tyranny and oppression
[03:08.240 --> 03:14.240]  and vampirism and cultural enslavement. But here's Schiff trying to deal with something that he can't
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.080]  deal with and even hesitates to say, well, we shouldn't make it too onerous. I mean, we should
[03:18.080 --> 03:23.600]  make it a good place to have business. Here is Mr. Schiff of Russiagate Fraud treading water.
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.480]  Look, you're a congressman from California. I know some of this is not in your domain because
[03:28.480 --> 03:32.800]  you go to Washington and work on national issues. But I live in California, so I'm going to bitch
[03:32.800 --> 03:41.120]  a little bit, can I? Because, you know, I mean, there is an exodus. California businesses are
[03:41.120 --> 03:48.560]  leaving the state in droves. In just 2018 and 19, which were economic boom years, 765 commercial
[03:48.560 --> 03:57.440]  facilities left, 13,000 businesses left between 2009 and 2016. Look, I came out here in 1983.
[03:57.440 --> 04:02.320]  I found paradise. I love California. I do. I don't want to leave.
[04:02.320 --> 04:11.200]  But I feel like I'm living in Italy in the 70s or something, super high taxes,
[04:11.200 --> 04:16.000]  potholes in the road. I don't know what I'm getting from my super high taxes.
[04:16.720 --> 04:25.920]  And this talk of exodus, you know, I tell you, people talk about this a lot now,
[04:25.920 --> 04:32.720]  and people are leaving. Like in my industry, Joe Rogan left Ben Shapiro. Sorry, ladies.
[04:35.680 --> 04:42.080]  Elon Musk talks about leaving. What do you say about that as a California representative?
[04:42.080 --> 04:46.320]  Well, I think we have to make every effort to make this a more business friendly state.
[04:46.320 --> 04:50.720]  And I don't think there's anything incompatible with being progressive and also
[04:50.720 --> 04:58.640]  want to make sure that this is the place that businesses consolidate. He's a monster demon,
[05:07.760 --> 05:15.280]  well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things. And I take my orders from Bill Gates,
[05:15.280 --> 05:22.960]  Dr Bill Gates. I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls everything you do. And he now says
[05:22.960 --> 05:29.120]  you're going to take the shots. And of course, in England, they are now saying what I told you,
[05:29.120 --> 05:35.760]  you will not be allowed to travel. Leave your home until you take all the shots. Dr Gates,
[05:35.760 --> 05:43.280]  I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four to five COVID shots
[05:43.280 --> 05:52.480]  a year for adults, two for baby, baby, much more manageable. Just like Bill Gates give you polio
[05:52.480 --> 05:57.680]  and vaccine. I'm Dr Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[05:57.680 --> 06:09.680]  When I grow up, I want to break the will of the globalists. I want to launch the tree in the future.
[06:09.680 --> 06:34.560]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance.
[06:34.560 --> 06:43.520]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[06:43.520 --> 06:48.160]  I'm going to give the listeners some really key headlines here as we launch this Monday
[06:48.160 --> 06:53.120]  transmission, 21 days after the election, 100 days out from the inauguration, which is the real
[06:53.120 --> 06:57.280]  date. We've got to look at the deep state, chai combat Democrats, so they're going to contest
[06:57.280 --> 07:01.520]  with the fraudulent ballots they put out by design. We've got big developments on that front. But first
[07:01.520 --> 07:07.680]  off, there's good news happening internationally, good news happening nationally, and good news
[07:07.680 --> 07:13.040]  happening in full wars. I never cry wolf to you, but a lot of times I can't tell you about the
[07:13.040 --> 07:18.560]  attacks we're under for a lot of reasons you can probably figure out. But you've really come
[07:18.560 --> 07:22.320]  through and supported us with your prayer, your word of mouth, and your financial support while
[07:22.320 --> 07:27.200]  getting great products at the same time. But we've had in the last week blessing after blessing
[07:27.200 --> 07:32.480]  happened and all glory goes to God and his son Jesus Christ. But I just want to thank you all for
[07:32.480 --> 07:37.520]  your prayers and your support because it's been really, really rough behind the scenes and really,
[07:37.520 --> 07:43.680]  really dark and really, really, we've been persecuted terribly, but we stayed faithful
[07:43.680 --> 07:50.080]  to God and to you supporting us. And we've just come through incredible times together. And someday
[07:50.080 --> 07:54.240]  I'll be able to tell you about all this, but now is not the time 21 days out from the election.
[07:54.240 --> 08:00.560]  But it's, it's, it's, it's been a fight. And you know, you see how the enemy comes after people,
[08:00.560 --> 08:04.560]  you see what they do to folks. So I'm sure you can figure out what's going on behind the scenes.
[08:04.560 --> 08:09.520]  But I'm not a victim. I expect this. My God, if I walked out in the parking lot and they walked
[08:09.520 --> 08:16.000]  up and shot me in the head, I would just expect that that didn't get the draw on them. I just
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.880]  expect to be killed quite frankly. That's worth it for this mission. I mean, I decided this because
[08:20.880 --> 08:25.440]  these people are evil and got to be opposed. So all the stuff they've done has not been fun behind
[08:25.440 --> 08:33.520]  the scenes, but it's been necessary. And so I've actually kind of enjoyed it other than the fact
[08:33.520 --> 08:39.280]  that, you know, I mean, I wish it wasn't going on, but I enjoy the fact that we've caused the global
[08:39.280 --> 08:43.360]  is so many problems. They've had to do the things they've done to us, but it's, it's, it's really
[08:43.360 --> 08:47.840]  the fight and standing up that I love and doing the right thing. And so I've not enjoyed the
[08:47.840 --> 08:53.040]  persecution for that reason. And I just want to thank you all for keeping us in the fight. You
[08:53.040 --> 08:58.000]  are the info war. When I say that to you, I'm not just saying that to patronize impact on the head.
[09:01.600 --> 09:07.120]  You've changed the world. You are the cadre of humans on this planet that have backed the most
[09:07.120 --> 09:11.840]  truthful, most accurate, most aggressive transmission out there. And I salute you all.
[09:11.840 --> 09:20.960]  Okay, let's get into it right now. Another incredible big piece of news that I can actually
[09:20.960 --> 09:25.360]  give you the details on our personal stuff to be revealed in a later point, because I think it'll
[09:25.360 --> 09:29.760]  be important historical marker, but now is not the time. This is the time. Look at these headlines
[09:29.760 --> 09:36.400]  from yesterday. Global bombshell UN says COVID restrictions and lockdowns are killing millions
[09:36.400 --> 09:42.800]  must stop. This all broke on Saturday at infowars.com and gateway punnet.com also broke it.
[09:43.520 --> 09:54.000]  And why is that important? Well, look at what just came out and what just broke today. Australian
[09:54.000 --> 10:03.040]  news news.com.au coronavirus WHO backflips on virus stands by condemning lockdowns.
[10:03.040 --> 10:13.040]  ABC News Australia WHO doctor says lockdowns should not be main coronavirus defense killing
[10:13.040 --> 10:18.240]  millions worldwide. WHO Director General Special Envoy, that's the guy that communicates with the
[10:18.240 --> 10:24.720]  world for the UN on COVID-19 preparedness and response came out and we played the video last
[10:24.720 --> 10:34.240]  night on the Sunday show and said that it's causing more death than it's saving by orders of magnitude.
[10:35.760 --> 10:40.960]  Now, I know you've heard this year 500 times, if not more, and I know you've looked at it yourself.
[10:40.960 --> 10:46.160]  I know you know that, but here's the good news. They're being forced to cover it now
[10:47.120 --> 10:51.120]  because there's major resistance in Latin America and in Africa where they're really getting hit
[10:51.120 --> 10:57.600]  hard and in poorer areas of Asia and Eastern Europe and people understand this is siege,
[10:57.600 --> 11:05.040]  this is blockade, and they understand that it's mass murder. So when a yuppie trendy
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.760]  is wearing their mask or telling you a lockdown needs to continue, just explain to them, hey,
[11:10.400 --> 11:14.320]  the hysteria and the chicken little fear mongering and the lockdown of the economy
[11:14.320 --> 11:21.600]  is killing the third world. When the first world has a depression, the third world dies. And a lot
[11:21.600 --> 11:26.640]  of people are cynical, a lot of leftists are, it's come out in studies that they're seven to nine
[11:26.640 --> 11:32.000]  times more likely to steal, six to eight times more likely to actually be secretly racist,
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.640]  you know, five to nine times, they all vary. That they virtue signal that they're giving
[11:38.640 --> 11:43.440]  to charity, but don't give to charity. They come into any organization or group and start
[11:43.440 --> 11:48.640]  infighting and destroy it claiming they care about everyone. They want power without actually doing
[11:48.640 --> 11:54.320]  any work. They're troublemakers. And so they're not even what you think of as a liberal. Thomas
[11:54.320 --> 11:59.200]  Jefferson was a liberal. He said small government rugged individualism. These people want government
[11:59.200 --> 12:03.600]  to micromanage every faster life. Now you wear a bubble when you go outside and just engage in
[12:03.600 --> 12:09.520]  constant fraud. They're scammers. They're magicians. They're fraudsters. They're not a magician you pay
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.320]  at a dinner party to do some fun tricks with this lovely assistant is wearing fish nets.
[12:14.320 --> 12:17.920]  These are scammers that brainwash your children, take control of your society,
[12:17.920 --> 12:22.320]  and set up frauds and then always set up new frauds on the problems they create.
[12:23.440 --> 12:26.560]  Problem reaction solution, the alien dialectic.
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.160]  I went out many times the last few months. If any of you have seen the videos at Bandai video,
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.840]  we'll go to the local park. We'll go to downtown and we'll show the trendies all staying six feet
[12:39.840 --> 12:44.800]  apart wearing their mask. And we point out, hey, this lockdown here, this chain reaction here
[12:45.440 --> 12:49.600]  is causing mass death. And a lot of them say you're right and nod their heads. About a third of them
[12:49.600 --> 12:55.840]  are more flip us off. And they come over to me and say, you're a racist. I mean, that's on video
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.040]  at the park. This group of women go FQ racist. I'm like, Africa is starving. It's the main continent
[13:01.040 --> 13:05.600]  being hit. Two million have already starved to death. They're like, F you racist. And it's a
[13:05.600 --> 13:10.240]  bunch of white women, one of them was black, like 10 women under a tree on a big blanket.
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.640]  They're all wearing masks, like they're bane from Batman. And I hear him going, that's shut up,
[13:16.640 --> 13:21.920]  racist, shut up. Yeah. So I walk over point, like, Oh, hey, it's starving the third world.
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.720]  Can I show you on my on my phone? Get back. And they had their pepper spray because
[13:26.720 --> 13:32.160]  to them, following mainstream media is virtue. They don't have to think they just follow what the
[13:32.160 --> 13:38.880]  mainstream media says. But now the United Nations scientists themselves are saying vaccines don't
[13:38.880 --> 13:45.360]  work. Vaccines are dangerous. The doctors don't believe in them. And we shouldn't have these
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.920]  lockdowns and shouldn't have all this garbage because it's actually not helping people. It's
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.880]  causing mass death. And I'm not lionizing the UN. It's a terrible group set up by the Rockefellers,
[13:54.880 --> 14:00.880]  set up by multinational corporations. It's it's international human rights board has got, you
[14:00.880 --> 14:10.880]  know, North Korea and what is it? Qatar and Saudi Arabia on it. I mean, it's a joke, folks.
[14:10.880 --> 14:17.840]  Communist China is on their board. And so all of this is going on. And these people just want to
[14:17.840 --> 14:22.160]  feel good. Well, it's our job to not let them have the moral authority while they wear their mask
[14:22.160 --> 14:26.160]  and while they keep businesses shut down and while they don't want school to go back and while they
[14:26.160 --> 14:29.840]  sue their employer because somebody got COVID in the office, but nobody even got sick, but
[14:29.840 --> 14:35.040]  they didn't shut the office down. You need to confront them that they're idiots that follow
[14:35.840 --> 14:41.760]  the Rockefeller head operative now. Bill Gates, he heads up the Rockefeller Foundation.
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.080]  That's just really behind this and the carding endowment. He gets all their money into his
[14:46.080 --> 14:52.240]  foundation for the takeover of world medicine. You need to tell them this is about Bill Gates
[14:52.240 --> 14:56.880]  setting the precedent to put things in my body and your body. And it's about a global reset to
[14:56.880 --> 15:01.600]  shut down the economy to starve the third world. And then when the third world collapses, the UN
[15:01.600 --> 15:08.320]  weaponizes those groups and uses them to invade us. So even the average leftist that is a secret
[15:08.320 --> 15:12.400]  racist and wants to starve Africans to death. Hell, most leftists will tell you too many people
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.400]  go, well, yeah, we need to kill them. Oh, but we need to take them in then and then put them on
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.760]  welfare so you can have them as a pet that you control. No, no, we need to build up Africa,
[15:21.760 --> 15:25.440]  build up every country with first world standards. And then we'll turn it all into giant tourist
[15:25.440 --> 15:30.320]  spots. America will be a tourist spot for Africans. There'll be a tourist spot for us.
[15:30.320 --> 15:35.120]  That's what you do. Development like Trump talks about. That cleans up the environment,
[15:35.120 --> 15:38.880]  lowers birth rates to two children for every two adults. That's the answer. But the globalists
[15:38.880 --> 15:44.400]  don't want a utopia. They want to dystopia. And it's up to us to recognize it and rebuke
[15:44.400 --> 15:51.040]  the snot knows educated, idiot morons that are really eugenicist and don't even know it.
[15:51.040 --> 16:19.680]  But now the U.N. officially says that the COVID event is killing more people than COVID.
[16:19.680 --> 16:24.800]  Is a clone of the side of the exact same links, the exact same videos. We can comment and share
[16:24.800 --> 16:31.440]  them everything. The system is censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four years
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.000]  ago. Trump has finally figured this out. And since he's going to take action once reelected,
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.680]  he gets big tech. I mean, he's modern situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.240]  now. So we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action. We the people are taking
[16:44.240 --> 16:49.280]  action now. And you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[16:49.280 --> 16:55.040]  and checking out the new redesign infomores.com and sharing that link. Oh, that really upsets him. Oh,
[16:55.040 --> 17:02.560]  yeah. The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and
[17:02.560 --> 17:09.200]  who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist. And he has a beast system that no
[17:09.200 --> 17:14.080]  one can buy and or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand.
[17:14.080 --> 17:20.480]  And we look back on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you don't
[17:20.480 --> 17:27.280]  believe in God or prophecy, giving governments corporations the power to control who can buy
[17:27.280 --> 17:32.560]  and who can sell to track everything we do. He's not just a recipe. It's a blueprint for total
[17:32.560 --> 17:37.360]  enslaved. But now you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say,
[17:37.360 --> 17:42.560]  we're technocrats. We should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much
[17:42.560 --> 17:47.360]  red meat you get. We're technocrats. We know best. And we're now going to set up the economy with
[17:47.360 --> 17:52.720]  a social score to totally control you. You snap your fingers. We're here. They're just rolling
[17:52.720 --> 18:18.720]  it out. And a lot of people are complying with it. It's insane. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.920]  again, super good news that the UN is being forced to cover their butt and say, okay,
[18:23.920 --> 18:29.360]  the lockdown is killing 10, 20, 30, 40 times what COVID is. It needs to scoff all the social
[18:29.360 --> 18:34.080]  distancing the end of the economy. It's causing a planetary collapse. It's going to flood the West.
[18:34.080 --> 18:37.920]  But of course, they've already triggered this. So now they want to act like they're fighting what
[18:37.920 --> 18:43.040]  they've already created. But at least we forced them earlier than they would to come out and say
[18:43.040 --> 18:48.000]  in the lockdowns. Now their solutions are going to be implantable chips, forced inoculations,
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.120]  contact tracers and tracking apps. That's all admitted. But first, we'll cover that next segment.
[18:53.120 --> 18:58.800]  Let's get into this powerful report that just went live by Greg Reese. Last month, the popular
[18:58.800 --> 19:03.600]  internationally syndicated program, the Dr. Phil show, delved into something that until recently
[19:03.600 --> 19:08.880]  hasn't even been on the pop culture radar, but is now one of the top trending issues in culture.
[19:08.880 --> 19:18.240]  The subject of adrenochrome. 21 years ago, when I was investigating the secretive bohemian grove
[19:18.240 --> 19:29.840]  elite cult in Northern California, that summer sets us free. I became aware of adrenochrome.
[19:29.840 --> 19:33.840]  In my research, I noted that Hunter S. Thompson had written about it in his book,
[19:33.840 --> 19:40.560]  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Two years ago, info wars investigative journalist Greg Reese
[19:40.560 --> 19:51.120]  did a five minute detailed analysis of adrenochrome. Anyone who's even done a cursory review of
[19:51.120 --> 19:58.480]  history knows that human sacrifice and the eating of organs to have a physical effect or get high
[19:58.480 --> 20:04.240]  happened in every ancient culture in Africa, in Asia, in what is the Middle East today, Europe,
[20:04.240 --> 20:10.480]  Mesoamerica, every culture during different periods degenerated and established priest
[20:10.480 --> 20:16.720]  class that would actually carry out the orderly human sacrifice of quote, virgins and children.
[20:17.600 --> 20:23.280]  The populations awakening to the grisly fact of adrenochrome is a red flag to the establishment
[20:23.280 --> 20:29.360]  that all of their satanic and darker cult practices are now being exposed. Mainstream media,
[20:29.360 --> 20:35.920]  the democratic party, make fun of anyone exposing giant child kidnapping rings that have been exposed.
[20:35.920 --> 20:40.560]  When the Associated Press came out two years ago and revealed thousands of Haitian children
[20:40.560 --> 20:45.440]  kidnapped by the UN, sex trafficked and many of them murdered, the left again covered the
[20:45.440 --> 20:52.320]  story up and made jokes. Humanity is awakening to the secret priesthood that sees us as animals
[20:52.320 --> 20:57.920]  as lower than animals in many cases who see us as a commodity to be bought, sold and traded.
[20:58.880 --> 21:04.480]  I want to believe that Dr. Phil is a good man. On the subject of adrenochrome and ritual satanism
[21:04.480 --> 21:08.480]  and black Sabbaths that are part of the historical record, I would be more than happy to come on
[21:08.480 --> 21:13.680]  Dr. Phil's show anytime he'd like and or to give him information, other guests that can give him
[21:13.680 --> 21:17.840]  the facts and the reality because this subject isn't going away, it's just getting bigger as
[21:17.840 --> 21:23.200]  humanity awakens. Here is part of the Dr. Phil segment and then Greg Reese's original from two
[21:23.200 --> 21:28.960]  years ago. My investigation has revealed that this is all linked to a ritual. I believe somebody
[21:28.960 --> 21:33.920]  in an occult was drugging my daughter Jesse for a year before she went missing. I believe that she
[21:33.920 --> 21:40.560]  was killed June 20th 2016 because it was a full moon and the summer solstice at the same time
[21:40.560 --> 21:46.160]  and then the next day was the Lilith. Lilith is a holiday that the occult does celebrate and it
[21:46.160 --> 21:51.600]  requires a human sacrifice. I had a person say to me that if I looked around at the environment
[21:51.600 --> 21:56.240]  and looked at the seasons I would see a pattern and as I looked and did more research realized
[21:56.240 --> 22:00.880]  that it was very specific and that people went missing on very specific days throughout the
[22:00.880 --> 22:06.080]  whole year. My mom thinks everything's connected to other missing persons cases like it's a big
[22:06.080 --> 22:11.360]  web. A lot of the times she'll say things like I know I sound crazy but it just started getting
[22:11.360 --> 22:16.960]  too out of control. I believe that Jesse was tortured for the drug adrenochrome. Adrenochrome
[22:16.960 --> 22:24.000]  is a chemical that our body produces when we're extremely fearful or have a lot of distress.
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.360]  It's a strength that gives you vitality and the people that killed Jesse are harvesting that
[22:29.360 --> 22:34.480]  from other people and when you drink it it gives you euphoria and power. My gang member told me
[22:34.480 --> 22:41.680]  later that he had a video of her death. He told me that Jesse had been killed, that her body had
[22:41.680 --> 22:47.600]  been put into a barrel and set on fire. The police do have a part of that video. I believe that the
[22:47.600 --> 23:02.000]  police are protecting her killer. Adrenochrome. Adrenochrome first hit pop culture in 1971
[23:02.000 --> 23:08.640]  when Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote about it in his book Fear and Loathing in Las
[23:08.640 --> 23:16.640]  Vegas. He wrote that his lawyer Oscar Acosta was defending a Satanist who was charged with molesting
[23:16.640 --> 23:26.400]  a child. The Satanist client paid his lawyer with adrenochrome and claimed the only source was the
[23:26.400 --> 23:34.880]  adrenaline glands from a living human body. If you search Google for adrenochrome the Google
[23:34.880 --> 23:41.600]  supported result is from the conspiracy wiki which suggests that it is all merely fantasy.
[23:43.040 --> 23:49.920]  But just to the right you will find that adrenochrome is real. According to scientific research
[23:49.920 --> 23:58.480]  adrenochrome is formed by the oxidation of its precursor adrenaline. Adrenaline is the active
[23:58.480 --> 24:07.920]  hormone from the adrenal medulla otherwise known as epinephrine. Epi pens are auto injectors that
[24:07.920 --> 24:15.200]  contain synthetic adrenaline. Developed by the U.S. military to protect soldiers in the event of
[24:15.200 --> 24:23.600]  chemical warfare. Epi pens are used to treat extreme allergic reactions. Epi pens only have
[24:23.600 --> 24:32.240]  a shelf life of about 18 months. According to the manufacturer after 18 months the oxidation process
[24:32.240 --> 24:42.800]  begins and the epi pens are turned into adrenochrome. Interestingly both companies that manufacture
[24:42.800 --> 24:55.680]  the epi pen Mylon and Kaleo are connected to the Clinton Foundation. Ambrosia a controversial new
[24:55.680 --> 25:02.160]  startup company was recently charging $8,000 to fill your veins with the blood of young people.
[25:03.760 --> 25:09.840]  Founder and CEO Dr. Jesse Carmeson who claims it will give you superhuman powers
[25:09.840 --> 25:15.200]  has recently ceased patient treatments due to a recent FDA warning.
[25:17.040 --> 25:24.160]  In Greek mythology ambrosia means immortality and was the food of the gods that gave longevity
[25:24.160 --> 25:31.920]  or immortality to whoever consumed it. It is believed by many researchers to represent the
[25:31.920 --> 25:39.920]  blood of the young. The cosmetic industry has been using aborted fetal tissues in various
[25:39.920 --> 25:48.400]  anti-aging skincare products. The taboo culture of consuming the young seems to go back through
[25:48.400 --> 25:58.160]  all of human history but now it seems to be coming out into the open. Democrats are pushing for full
[25:58.160 --> 26:04.880]  term abortions. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant
[26:04.880 --> 26:10.640]  would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would
[26:10.640 --> 26:16.240]  ensue between the physicians and the mothers. And telling us that the future is too grim for us to
[26:16.240 --> 26:21.600]  think about raising a family. There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going
[26:21.600 --> 26:29.120]  to be very difficult. Is it okay to still have children? How far is this going to go before humanity
[26:29.120 --> 26:42.000]  has enough? For newswars.com this is Greg Reese. All right only way this dog hunts is you take action.
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.760]  It's on infowars.com and newswars.com and band.video. Bubble away with the negrina
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.920]  chrome drug terrifies satanic elite. I suggest you use this weapon.
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.720]  For more than a hundred years the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government,
[27:00.720 --> 27:06.080]  abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education and most importantly
[27:06.080 --> 27:12.560]  taking control of western medicine. Now they had a bad name by the 1920s. They started converting
[27:12.560 --> 27:18.720]  over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics
[27:18.720 --> 27:25.120]  operations. Fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of
[27:25.120 --> 27:30.160]  directors to Bill Gates III, his father of course being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[27:30.160 --> 27:36.400]  And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world every
[27:36.400 --> 27:43.040]  national health system. Bill Gates is in control. They have spent a hundred plus years getting
[27:43.040 --> 27:48.160]  positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.920]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA
[27:53.920 --> 28:00.400]  in your body. There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States,
[28:00.400 --> 28:05.600]  much less in the entire world. Infowars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite
[28:05.600 --> 28:11.360]  uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up. Almost no one else has that especially anybody
[28:11.360 --> 28:17.440]  covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human
[28:17.440 --> 28:23.680]  globalist death agenda. That's why when we go out and shoot videos they're at Band-Aught Video.
[28:23.680 --> 28:29.440]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's why it's so precious because
[28:29.440 --> 28:35.360]  censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can
[28:35.360 --> 28:41.440]  say and do. It's going to be the OACs, Black Band-Aught Video, and the now redesigned InfoWars.com
[28:41.440 --> 28:46.240]  that become more and more important, which they are. And the enemy is suing us, attacking us,
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.680]  hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now
[28:51.680 --> 28:57.440]  because they're coming after everyone. So spread the word now. Introducing InfoWars Life,
[28:57.440 --> 29:05.280]  Pure Turmeric Extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is pure turmeric. It goes together
[29:05.280 --> 29:10.960]  very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and

[29:30.720 --> 29:36.000]  bodies. Some like bodies better. For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action

[30:18.800 --> 30:29.120]  It's called a big Trump win. And it's in 21 days, but it's going to be contested.
[30:30.640 --> 30:34.160]  And the globalists are going to try to block it, but they're going to try to obfuscate,
[30:34.160 --> 30:38.960]  try to break the country up. But they're not Americans. They believe the country shouldn't
[30:38.960 --> 30:45.120]  even exist. They're globalists. Get on your host Alex Jones. We've got so much to cover,
[30:45.120 --> 30:50.080]  so much to get into. Let me do this. Was to give you an idea of what we got on the
[30:52.640 --> 30:58.720]  table here in front of us. Got Laura Loomer joining us in the third hour because she had Skype
[30:58.720 --> 31:03.680]  problems last week. She had a lot of news to break. We're going to open the phones up.
[31:05.440 --> 31:13.200]  We're going to be taking your phone calls coming up next hour. And we're going to be getting into
[31:13.200 --> 31:19.120]  not just that the UN has officially come out and said the lockdown is killing way more people
[31:19.760 --> 31:25.280]  and the checkpoints of the mask and just all the breakdown of society and the shutdown of
[31:25.280 --> 31:31.520]  businesses is killing way more than COVID-19 ever dreamed of. Even the Nation magazine
[31:32.720 --> 31:38.080]  has come out against Bill Gates. And now he really is tax exempt because he gives money
[31:38.080 --> 31:42.480]  to other companies he owns as a way to get around taxes. And that's how he's become
[31:42.480 --> 31:48.000]  one of the richest men on earth. While the poor get sick, Bill Gates gets richer. Just incredible
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.720]  to have them actually tell him the truth about that. It makes the head spin.
[31:54.080 --> 31:59.120]  Meanwhile, the social unrest that the globalists have going on, rioters topple Abraham Lincoln,
[31:59.120 --> 32:04.480]  Teddy Roosevelt statues in Portland. He's in windows smashed out. The next segment,
[32:05.040 --> 32:10.880]  I'm going to cover an article out of the New York Times saying in search of Antifa, in search of
[32:10.880 --> 32:16.560]  looters, in search of rioters. And the New York Times says it doesn't exist. Well, I've got a video
[32:16.560 --> 32:23.200]  that's going to go with that that shows you shows you how that doesn't exist.
[32:24.320 --> 32:31.120]  Meanwhile, China holds military invasion drills of Hong Kong and Taiwan amid tensions with Taiwan
[32:31.680 --> 32:35.360]  is doing fighter bomber flyovers of the city's provocative
[32:35.360 --> 32:44.480]  attack run test and are threatening to attack US ships that they say are in Chinese waters that
[32:44.480 --> 32:49.920]  the Chinese just declared the entire South China Sea basically to be theirs all the way up to the
[32:49.920 --> 32:56.800]  north of Japan and the islands to the Spratlys down into the Philippines. They've even been
[32:56.800 --> 33:07.680]  attacking Vietnamese waters and ships and taking oil rigs that are in waters 400 miles from the
[33:07.680 --> 33:15.040]  coast of China. You look at China, it's right here. And then there's Vietnam down down below it.
[33:15.040 --> 33:21.680]  I mean, they're down in southern Vietnam grabbing, sending troops in and killing everybody on oil
[33:21.680 --> 33:28.080]  rigs and taking them over. I mean, China is out of control. Imagine the United States just randomly
[33:28.080 --> 33:35.200]  pulled up to somebody's oil rigs without declaring war and just blew up the command center and took
[33:35.200 --> 33:42.000]  it over. That's what's going on in a routine basis, but it barely even hits the news.
[33:42.000 --> 33:51.920]  But you can look at it. Chinese takeover of Vietnamese oil rigs kill those on board.
[33:53.920 --> 33:57.280]  And they're building all these islands out there and then claiming that they've got
[33:57.280 --> 34:01.360]  hundreds of square miles around each island is now theirs. And they're putting all these
[34:01.360 --> 34:09.200]  weapons systems and missile launchers on them. Crazy. And then Trump says we shouldn't
[34:09.200 --> 34:17.120]  roll over to it and oh, he's a bad guy, ladies and gentlemen. No, he's getting us out of wars
[34:17.120 --> 34:22.240]  that we shouldn't be in and standing up to people that are trying to push the entire planet around.
[34:22.240 --> 34:31.040]  It's like Japan 2.0. But this time it's the communist Chinese that are doing it because
[34:31.040 --> 34:36.080]  they've been greenlit by elites here in the West to do it, who believe they can get rid of Trump
[34:36.080 --> 34:43.440]  and believe China can push us around. It's outrageous. Now, I've got more than 30 incredible
[34:43.440 --> 34:48.640]  clips, but again, maybe once a week we'll play a clip twice in a row. We're about to do that now.
[34:49.440 --> 34:53.840]  Let's start the show with it. You may have missed it. It's a big deal because when I saw this clip
[34:53.840 --> 35:02.960]  yesterday and then I saw that it was on info wars.com, it made me think to what we saw with our
[35:02.960 --> 35:07.680]  ancestors, many of ours, leaving Europe to get away from the kings and oppression and serve them
[35:07.680 --> 35:12.480]  to come here. How many other folks came to America seeking a better life, seeking basic freedoms?
[35:14.160 --> 35:18.160]  And how when you hear about an exodus out of California, it's not really an exodus
[35:19.120 --> 35:25.040]  out of California. It's an exodus, a fleeing from a political oppressive system.
[35:25.040 --> 35:34.000]  And so Bill Maher is finally recognizing that there's a supposed exodus. He's postulating,
[35:34.000 --> 35:41.040]  is there an exodus? There's been a brain drain and a financial drain for 20 years out of California.
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.960]  It was once a vibrant red state, once very populist, once very pro-American, once beautiful and clean
[35:46.960 --> 35:54.480]  and good and a world destination. Much of California now represents a dystopic science
[35:54.480 --> 36:00.000]  fiction nightmare. I don't have to go over all that for you, but it's because the globalists
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.360]  are trying to bankrupt all of America. They're trying to bankrupt Europe. They're trying to
[36:03.360 --> 36:09.600]  bankrupt Africa because they want to consolidate control. That's their stated goal. So when shifts
[36:09.600 --> 36:14.800]  confronted by the exodus, they're trying to collapse New York, New Jersey, California,
[36:15.440 --> 36:22.640]  Michigan and other states they've controlled into us. So it's not mismanagement. It's that they loot
[36:22.640 --> 36:30.320]  all the infrastructure and all the money. It's well-known. It's documented. And so Maher is
[36:30.320 --> 36:37.040]  talking about a California exodus. No. It's people running from the communism, from the socialism,
[36:37.040 --> 36:42.160]  from the Chinese communists that basically run California, Oregon and Washington state.
[36:43.120 --> 36:48.640]  So the full video is up on infowars.com, but here's part of SHIF, of the SHIF show,
[36:48.640 --> 36:54.560]  the globalists who's dedicated to bringing down our president that's actually trying to
[36:54.560 --> 37:00.480]  reverse the policies that have America imploding. And now SHIF's blaming Trump for the COVID-19
[37:00.480 --> 37:05.360]  that they brought in and the lockdown Democrats engineered that's killing the economy as well.
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.560]  They're having hearings in Congress today showing people that have died of COVID and saying it's
[37:10.560 --> 37:15.680]  Trump's fault. This is so transparent. It's so ridiculous. And people should reject it and be
[37:15.680 --> 37:19.760]  angry at the Democrats who are the party of world government, the party of open borders,
[37:19.760 --> 37:25.520]  the party of homeless, the party of fentanyl, the party of Satanism, the party of pedophilia,
[37:25.520 --> 37:34.960]  the party of corruption. And so here's SHIF trying to put perfume on the pig they've created.
[37:38.320 --> 37:42.000]  Look, you're a congressman from California. I know some of this is not in your domain because
[37:42.000 --> 37:47.840]  you go to Washington and work on national issues, but I live in California. I know
[37:47.840 --> 37:52.720]  you're a congressman. You're in DC dealing with bigger things than our state. No, congressmen
[37:52.720 --> 37:57.760]  are supposed to first and foremost, when their house members deal with what they're doing domestically
[37:57.760 --> 38:03.760]  in the state 70% of the time, maybe during wartime, 30% they worry about federal stuff and wars and
[38:03.760 --> 38:10.080]  foreign things. The Senate is more about foreign entanglements and treaties. That's their job.
[38:10.080 --> 38:14.160]  So the idea that, oh, it's not your fault that California is a hellhole. You've been busy trying
[38:14.160 --> 38:17.840]  to overthrow our populist president. You've been busy with your, well, just go ahead and go back
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.800]  to them. Look, you're a congressman from California. I know some of this is not in your
[38:22.800 --> 38:27.200]  domain because you go to Washington and work on national issues, but I live in California. So
[38:27.200 --> 38:35.280]  I'm going to bitch a little bit, can I? Because, you know, I mean, there is an exodus. California
[38:35.280 --> 38:42.400]  businesses are leaving the state in droves. In just 2018 and 19, which were economic boom years,
[38:42.400 --> 38:51.440]  765 commercial facilities left. 13,000 businesses left between 2009 and 2016. Look, I came out
[38:51.440 --> 38:57.840]  here in 1983. I found paradise. I love California. I do. I don't want to leave.
[38:57.840 --> 39:06.720]  But I feel like I'm living in Italy in the 70s or something. Super high taxes,
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.520]  potholes in the road. I don't know what I'm getting from my super high taxes.
[39:12.240 --> 39:15.920]  And I do understand this. You're getting a revolution in political America.
[39:15.920 --> 39:23.040]  You know, I tell you, people talk about this a lot now and people are leaving. Like in my
[39:23.040 --> 39:33.360]  industry, Joe Rogan left Ben Shapiro. Sorry, ladies. Elon Musk talks about leaving.
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.200]  What do you say about this as a California representative? Well, I think we have to make
[39:39.200 --> 39:42.480]  every effort to make this a more business friendly state. And I don't think there's
[39:42.480 --> 39:47.840]  anything incompatible with being progressive and also want to make sure that this is a place that
[39:47.840 --> 39:54.240]  businesses like cancer can survive and thrive.
[40:04.720 --> 40:11.280]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your
[40:11.280 --> 40:16.640]  Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes
[40:16.640 --> 40:23.680]  up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video.
[40:23.680 --> 40:28.480]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to
[40:28.480 --> 40:32.800]  stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override
[40:32.800 --> 40:38.320]  them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you
[40:38.320 --> 40:43.120]  whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook,
[40:43.120 --> 40:47.200]  on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[40:54.400 --> 41:00.880]  Info Wars is a archetypal classic example of free independent organic resistance against
[41:00.880 --> 41:07.280]  tyranny. You built Info Wars. You spread the word. You prayed for us. You bought the products.
[41:07.280 --> 41:12.800]  You called in. You made recommendations. Info Wars is as much yours as it is mine. And that's
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.840]  why the enemy is so upset that under the deep platforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under
[41:17.840 --> 41:23.360]  all the attack, in many ways, we become stronger with band.video, redesigned Info Wars, with all
[41:23.360 --> 41:31.040]  of our great crew, with documentary films, and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day. We are the
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.720]  resistance. You are the resistance. So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.280]  continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because this is
[41:41.280 --> 41:45.760]  something we built together. It's not just a national treasure. It's a treasure worldwide
[41:45.760 --> 41:49.440]  against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it. And as everything we talked
[41:49.440 --> 42:12.800]  about comes true, our credibility only goes up together. So I salute you all.
[42:19.680 --> 42:26.800]  Good old fashioned stupidity. No more pesky law and order. When Democrats are in charge, nobody's
[42:26.800 --> 42:32.720]  safe. Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[42:33.520 --> 42:39.280]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[42:39.280 --> 42:53.200]  cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[42:55.200 --> 43:01.120]  2020ElectionCenter.com. Just type it in one time. You've got to save right there in your browser.
[43:01.120 --> 43:07.280]  And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms. Most importantly,
[43:07.280 --> 43:14.880]  via text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to banned.video,
[43:14.880 --> 43:21.360]  but 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same videos,
[43:21.360 --> 43:27.760]  we can comment, we can share them, everything. The system is censoring because of the power of
[43:27.760 --> 43:31.840]  the people who overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured this out and since
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.320]  he's going to take action once reelected against big tech, and then he's modern in the situation.
[43:36.320 --> 43:39.440]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry
[43:39.440 --> 43:43.600]  because he has taken action. We the people are taking action now and you can do it very,
[43:43.600 --> 43:48.640]  very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com, and checking out the new
[43:48.640 --> 44:06.480]  redesign, infomores.com, and sharing that link. Hope that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[44:19.280 --> 44:30.800]  Oh,
[44:30.800 --> 44:37.920]  ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are back live. I've got two
[44:38.880 --> 44:42.560]  stories I want to cover right now that illustrate the left and their want to be
[44:42.560 --> 44:50.240]  gaslighting and how they try to convince us to deny our eyes, deny our ears, deny our noses,
[44:50.240 --> 44:55.360]  our touch, our sixth sense, our discernment, our connection to God, our everything,
[44:55.360 --> 45:02.320]  and just believe their lies. There's several of these. One of them I'll get to in a moment is,
[45:02.320 --> 45:12.720]  remember Nadler, a little globalist penguin-like creature, and I don't want to insult actual
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.920]  penguins, aquatic birds. I mean, like the Batman villain, penguin. Remember him saying antifa is
[45:17.920 --> 45:26.320]  a myth that doesn't exist? Well, now the New York Times has come out and said that anarchists don't
[45:26.320 --> 45:30.880]  exist either, which are part of the antifa movement, and there's just no violence and none of it is
[45:30.880 --> 45:36.400]  happening. Help me find Trump's anarchist in Portland. There was a whole New York Times article
[45:39.280 --> 45:43.040]  about how this doesn't exist. They're not blocking roads, shooting people in the head.
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.360]  They're not burning down police stations. They're not firebombing federal buildings.
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.160]  They're not. They didn't attack and beat out the windows of our armored vehicle a few months ago
[45:52.160 --> 46:02.000]  in Austin. They didn't beat up Savannah Hernandez three times. No. They do not exist. The New York
[46:02.000 --> 46:09.280]  Times and Congressman Nadler say so, so that's coming up. But first, I thought I'd hit this
[46:09.280 --> 46:13.200]  article on some point in FullWars.com. The full interview is there. I'll just play a short clip.
[46:13.760 --> 46:20.480]  Sex pistols Johnny Rotten says, of course, I'm voting for Trump because he's a rebel. You can see
[46:20.480 --> 46:27.600]  the whole systems against Trump. He goes on to say that Biden is obviously senile, has dementia.
[46:27.600 --> 46:32.480]  He goes, my wife has Alzheimer's. I know what it looks like. He doesn't know where he is sometimes.
[46:32.480 --> 46:38.480]  He's out of his mind. And the media says back to Johnny Rotten, oh, how do you know you're not a
[46:38.480 --> 46:44.560]  doctor? Well, that's like saying of a cobra bite you don't, you know, you don't know to go to a
[46:44.560 --> 46:48.640]  doctor. Or it's like saying, oh, you're not a mechanic. You don't know how to know when your
[46:48.640 --> 46:56.560]  car overheated and then the radiator blows up. It's ridiculous. You know when people have dementia.
[46:56.560 --> 47:01.680]  You know when you have Alzheimer's. And as bad off as Joe is, I'd say you won't know who he is
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.960]  in a year or two. This all started two years ago. And we said he's cognitively slipping.
[47:06.960 --> 47:12.160]  They had fact checkers and pull it a fact. Oh, Jones is crazy. Biden's super smart. He's all
[47:12.160 --> 47:16.720]  there. Jones is even more banned on Facebook. You can't even say nice things about Jones now,
[47:16.720 --> 47:21.840]  or you'll be banned. He's not just banned, but saying nice things about his band because he says
[47:21.840 --> 47:28.480]  Biden looks like he had another stroke. Then they fact check. He's not out of stroke. I said looks
[47:28.480 --> 47:35.280]  like he's had a stroke. I got another big USA today. Fat check where Jones says doctors are
[47:35.280 --> 47:40.480]  trying to kill Trump at Walter Reed. I said they're either trying to kill him or their idiots,
[47:40.480 --> 47:43.600]  because all these scientists say you don't want to cross these true experimental drugs.
[47:43.600 --> 47:49.040]  When there's a very enough is dangerous. It's a figure of speech. Thank God the president's okay.
[47:49.040 --> 47:54.480]  But in the report, I said either they're trying to kill him or their idiots. Later we learned
[47:54.480 --> 47:58.960]  Trump demanded it be done, which they really are idiots. I love the president. But my God,
[48:00.320 --> 48:04.960]  just because your patient is heroic doesn't mean, you know, that you want experimental
[48:04.960 --> 48:09.120]  treatments that are dangerous. So again, they misrepresent what you said to then fact check
[48:09.120 --> 48:15.440]  it to say it's wrong. But I'm digressing. Here's what sex pistols Johnny Rotten had to say. They're
[48:15.440 --> 48:21.200]  like, how dare you? He said he's he could want a spelling bee while he's got the mind of a 20 year
[48:21.200 --> 48:29.440]  old genius. I mean, Joe Biden's perfectly fine. Here it is. Tax hikes beyond belief, more lockdowns,
[48:29.440 --> 48:37.120]  more confusion, more bureaucracy, and less answers. You're thinking of voting Republican or not at
[48:37.120 --> 48:44.400]  all. Yes, I am. I'm going to definitely for Trump. I've I have seen what Democrats have done to
[48:44.400 --> 48:49.760]  California. They have destroyed this place. It's quite hard to imagine John Lydon voting for Donald
[48:49.760 --> 48:54.800]  Trump. I don't know. Many people might think well, he's he's an individual thinker. I'll give him
[48:54.800 --> 49:01.120]  that for a start. He's not the most lovable fellow and God serve. But I cannot see the opposition
[49:01.120 --> 49:10.560]  is offering me anything by way of a solution. Joe Biden is is in all practicality, senile,
[49:10.560 --> 49:15.360]  and delinquently. And the full clip they go, you can't say that you're not a doctor. If he can't
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.200]  talk, it doesn't know what planet he's on. You have you have a right to an opinion that you're
[49:19.200 --> 49:23.520]  not going to vote for him because you look like a senile. But now they're fact checking Johnny
[49:23.520 --> 49:33.920]  Rotten. This is the David fact check satire now. Unbelievable. So speaking of that, you remember
[49:33.920 --> 49:42.640]  again, Congressman Nadler saying that Antifa doesn't exist. It's a myth. Here it is.
[49:44.320 --> 49:47.040]  There's violence across the whole country. Do you disavow the violence from Antifa?
[49:47.840 --> 49:52.320]  That's happening in Portland right now. That's a myth that's being spread
[49:52.320 --> 49:57.280]  only in Washington DC about Antifa in Portland. Yes, sir. There's videos everywhere online.
[49:57.280 --> 50:02.880]  There's fires and riots. There's throwing fireworks at federal officers. DHS is there.
[50:03.520 --> 50:12.400]  Look online. It gets crazy, Mr. Nadler. Okay, so that was a couple months ago. Here's the New
[50:12.400 --> 50:19.040]  York Times article. And again, they've they've been recycled these but help me find Trump's
[50:19.040 --> 50:23.120]  anarchist in Portland. And this is an article from back in July, but they've got similar ones out
[50:23.120 --> 50:29.440]  right now saying the exact same thing. It doesn't exist. How foolish they are. How dumb they think
[50:29.440 --> 50:34.800]  we are. And now happening today, writers topple Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt statues in
[50:34.800 --> 50:40.720]  Portland. But Abraham Lincoln helped in slavery. They don't know it's it's an old white dude get
[50:40.720 --> 50:47.040]  rid of him. Meanwhile, Utah high school student bullied Spad on for wearing a hat and support
[50:47.040 --> 50:54.720]  a president Trump KU TV. On info wars.com Swedish student banned from wearing Christian cross
[50:54.720 --> 51:00.000]  for school photograph because it might upset the Muslims. See, you don't have rights. Everybody
[51:00.000 --> 51:05.680]  else does but you're a Christian. You don't. Meanwhile, city of Denver accused shooter
[51:05.680 --> 51:11.200]  hell he's on video. Matthew dole off is not licensed to be a security guard. So you have channel nine
[51:11.200 --> 51:17.920]  goon executing an unarmed man. And the left is, of course, celebrating that as well. Coming up
[51:17.920 --> 51:21.760]  on election night. We already told you this months ago, but now it's official Twitter, Facebook,
[51:21.760 --> 51:26.000]  along with Google. They don't mention that here will censor election related posts saying Trump
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.760]  has won the election. They're saying they will not allow him to declare a victory.
[51:30.800 --> 51:35.040]  Even if he's right or wrong, he has a right to declare it. But no, he is not allowed to do that.
[51:35.040 --> 51:43.840]  They say. So that's all coming up. Now I want to give the number out. I want to take your phone
[51:43.840 --> 51:50.880]  calls in our number two. First time callers, people that agree disagree. We don't screen your
[51:50.880 --> 51:54.720]  calls only that you have a good phone and that you tell us where you're calling from if you'd
[51:54.720 --> 51:59.520]  like, or you don't have to. So we don't screen your calls. The toll free number to join us is
[51:59.520 --> 52:09.120]  877-789-2539-877-789-2539-877-789 Alex. And if you're in a foreign country and only you
[52:09.120 --> 52:16.000]  dial the one hundred number sometimes the US country access code at 512-646-1776
[52:16.000 --> 52:25.520]  512-646-1776 or 877-789-ALEX. All right. All right. This has been in for a month.
[52:25.520 --> 52:32.480]  And it's incredible. And I'm very excited about it. And I've been so busy. I haven't even launched it.
[52:32.480 --> 52:38.560]  We have a limited supply of it. And despite that is discounted 50% out of the gates because I want
[52:38.560 --> 52:43.840]  you to get it. And I want to move it out of our warehouse in case Trump loses and they arrest me
[52:43.840 --> 52:47.360]  and shut everything down, which believe me, they're trying to do. Though we just got some news
[52:47.360 --> 52:51.600]  today that it's not as desperate as it was. It's very good news. I'm going to get into it again.
[52:51.600 --> 52:59.680]  But a lot of good news. We thank God certainly for that. But experience the surface cleaning power
[53:00.240 --> 53:05.520]  of InfoWarsLife's nascent iodine spray. This is not like the X2 spray that you ingest,
[53:05.520 --> 53:11.440]  but helps aerosolize it into your throat, into your mouth, you know, down into your bronchioles.
[53:12.000 --> 53:19.280]  This is super strong type of iodine that is not for anything but hard surfaces.
[53:19.280 --> 53:26.960]  Pots, pans, countertops, marble, not for your skin, not for your furniture. This is super
[53:26.960 --> 53:34.400]  industrial level strength. Nascent iodine mixed with another very strong type of iodine.
[53:34.400 --> 53:41.440]  Go read about it for yourself. It's massively discounted 50% off out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[53:41.440 --> 53:46.720]  We're going to end this big mega sale in seven days because we've almost sold out of all of our
[53:46.720 --> 53:51.360]  best-selling items, many of which we didn't even reorder because the supply chain's broken down,
[53:51.360 --> 53:55.120]  and we wanted to see how much capital we could get into budget in the future. But you've really
[53:55.120 --> 53:58.240]  supported this, so we're going to have enough money, it looks like, to be able to order a lot
[53:58.240 --> 54:02.400]  of the best-selling products and reorder them and have them by next year. But a lot of the best
[54:02.400 --> 54:07.200]  selling products, like the fish oil, like the X2, like the X3, like the DNA Force Plus,
[54:07.200 --> 54:13.840]  like the Winter Sun, Vazo Beats, Knockout, 8-pack power stack will never be back. It's about to
[54:13.840 --> 54:24.640]  sell out within a matter of days. Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139. But the new nascent iodine surface
[54:24.640 --> 54:31.600]  spray, high-powered cleaning agent that annihilates basically everything, is available now at
[54:31.600 --> 54:37.760]  infowarstore.com. And then we have the new, again, X2 spray that's for internal, that's X2
[54:37.760 --> 54:46.480]  spray bottle, that's discounted too, you know it's selling out. Infowarstore.com. The answer to 1984
[54:47.760 --> 54:50.160]  is 1776.
[54:58.320 --> 55:03.280]  Info Wars has been banned. Arrested.
[55:03.280 --> 55:14.480]  Attacked and threatened. Because we are effective. The great awakening is here.
[55:14.480 --> 55:25.040]  Go to band.video, download the videos and share. Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[55:25.040 --> 55:33.840]  and never give up the fight.
[55:39.520 --> 55:41.840]  InfoWars.com
[55:45.680 --> 55:52.320]  In fiction, super villains are known as super villains because they have gigantic huge global
[55:52.320 --> 55:57.680]  plans that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex. And about to told you a year
[55:57.680 --> 56:03.520]  ago, back in October of 2019, that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN would roll out
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.800]  a global hysteria and lock down the planet and start millions of people and would be pushing
[56:08.800 --> 56:13.600]  a forced inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that this same billionaire would
[56:13.600 --> 56:18.720]  say we're all going to work from home now and that this was good to lower the carbon footprint
[56:18.720 --> 56:23.360]  and the human population. You tell me that's crazy. You tell me that's a dystopia. You tell
[56:23.360 --> 56:28.640]  me that's some type of science fiction comic book. But in reality, it really did happen.
[56:28.640 --> 56:34.160]  His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father
[56:34.160 --> 56:39.760]  and mother set up more than 60 years ago. And we're living in this world Bill Gates is built.
[56:39.760 --> 56:44.000]  Until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates's property. It's time to expose Bill Gates.
[56:44.000 --> 56:50.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:52.160 --> 56:58.080]  Pressee of Democrat Michigan, Governor Whitmer's executive orders have become an exercise of
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.960]  infamous tyranny. Governor Gretchen Whitmer says her husband tried to make a joke,
[57:02.960 --> 57:08.000]  but her critics are not laughing tonight. They latched on to what some interpreted as a power
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.920]  play amid the pandemic. My husband made a failed attempt at humor last week, knowing it wouldn't
[57:13.920 --> 57:18.960]  make a difference. He jokingly asked if marrying, if being married to me might move him up in the
[57:18.960 --> 57:25.120]  queue. Over the past couple of months, we have seen an explosion of rampant rumors and violent
[57:25.120 --> 57:30.720]  death threats against my family and me online. Because of that, I'm not going to get into the
[57:30.720 --> 57:41.520]  business of refuting and discussing every, every aspect of my whereabouts or dispelling every
[57:41.520 --> 57:46.480]  inaccurate statement or post, because frankly, there's just too many to keep up with.
[57:47.200 --> 57:51.440]  No one likes having to stay home right now and not being able to visit loved ones, but four
[57:51.440 --> 57:55.840]  people, including three from right here in Oakland County, argue the governor's extended
[57:55.840 --> 58:01.040]  stay at home order is not only inconvenient, it's unconstitutional. The lawsuit seeking relief under
[58:01.040 --> 58:05.840]  the fifth and 14th amendments claims Governor Whitmer's executive order unfairly infringes
[58:05.840 --> 58:10.080]  on their rights to associate with friends and family and utilize their private property.
[58:10.080 --> 58:17.680]  We believe what the governor has done with her orders is, is overbroad and overreaching on taking
[58:17.680 --> 58:23.840]  a sledgehammer to an aunt. Resulting in a lockdown protest so overwhelming, Whitmer just had to react.
[58:23.840 --> 58:29.680]  A small group of people that came together without masks on, brandishing their weapons who were
[58:30.400 --> 58:36.240]  having, you know, posters of being anti-choice. I mean, this was a political rally.
[58:36.240 --> 58:43.120]  I feel that they are overreaching, overreacting and crushing our small businesses, crushing our
[58:43.120 --> 58:49.840]  economy. And what brought me out here is I'm a small business owner and she's putting me out of
[58:49.840 --> 58:55.440]  business. It was only a matter of time before her hubris-riddled occupancy of the Michigan
[58:55.440 --> 59:00.800]  governor's mansion would be flipped on its head by the Democrats' white supremacist narrative.
[59:00.800 --> 59:05.840]  Planned to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and then what they were planning to do to her,
[59:05.840 --> 59:11.200]  13 suspects arrested including seven alleged members of a right-wing militia group,
[59:11.200 --> 59:15.520]  the FBI and state authorities conducting a series of raids in Michigan.
[59:15.520 --> 59:20.560]  Those 13 suspects taken into custody, seven of them, alleged members of that right-wing militia
[59:20.560 --> 59:25.040]  group. Today, Governor Whitmer thanking authorities for protecting her and her family, but went on
[59:25.040 --> 59:29.760]  to talk about white supremacists in this country. And the president who she pointed out was asked
[59:29.760 --> 59:34.240]  to condemn white supremacists on that debate stage. You'll remember the president saying,
[59:34.240 --> 59:39.440]  stand back and stand by. Just last week, the president of the United States stood before
[59:39.440 --> 59:46.160]  the American people and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups like these two
[59:46.160 --> 59:51.920]  Michigan militia groups. Our head of state has spent the past seven months denying science,
[59:51.920 --> 1:00:01.040]  ignoring his own health experts, stoking distrust, fomenting anger, and giving comfort to those who
[1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:08.080]  spread fear and hatred and division. I went on to say that they're very good people on both sides
[1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:15.280]  again. Come on. People have walked around and the governor's driveway with assault rifles and
[1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:22.000]  wave flags. I mean, this is something to be concerned about. And he saw what the head of
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:27.920]  the FBI said a couple days ago. He said the greatest terrorist threat in America is from white
[1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:34.080]  supremacists. But like the liberal industrial complexes smears against Nick Sandman, Kyle
[1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:39.600]  Rittenhouse, and the Proud Boys wrongfully branding them white supremacists, there was more to the
[1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:45.920]  story than Whitmer wanted her subjects to know. The Hill reported that Democrat Delaware Governor
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:51.440]  John Carney last year signed the pardon of one of the men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:57.520]  Governor Gretchen Whitmer, first reported by the Delaware News Journal. Carney in April of 2019
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:03.200]  signed off on the pardon for Barry Gordon Croft Jr., who faced a series of charges in Delaware
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:07.920]  during the mid 90s, including possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony,
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:13.680]  assault and burglary. A spokesman for Carney said in a statement that the governor called Croft's
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:19.200]  federal charges disturbing and said, this is only another warning sign about the growing
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:25.280]  threat of violence and radicalization in our politics. Okay, Carney, but from who? Croft walked
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:31.040]  free on a Democrat's watch. And of course, two of the alleged kidnappers turned out to be Trump
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:39.280]  hating anarchists. Trump is not your friend, dude. And it's, it's amazes me that people actually
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:44.560]  like believe that. All right, the full report is at Band-Aid video. It's Whitmer narrative backfires
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:49.840]  against even worse turns out their black lives matter Antifa and anarchist idiot drug addicts.
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:57.920]  There you go. There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States,
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:02.640]  much less in the entire world. Info wars and stand alone with our own radio and TV
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:07.600]  satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations, picking us up. Almost no one else has that,
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:13.280]  especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:19.520]  and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda. That's why when we go out and shoot videos,
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:25.840]  they're at Band-Aid video. They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:31.440]  why it's so precious because the censorship expands to everyone, which it is now with AI
[1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:36.880]  monitoring, controlling what you can say and do. It's going to be the LACs like Band-Aid video and
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:42.000]  the now redesigned info wars.com that become more and more important, which they are. And the enemy
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.920]  is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:03:03.840]  shut us down right now because they're coming after everyone. So spread the word now.
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:11.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones. You know, I'm not
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:15.760]  doing a perfect job. I think I'm doing a decent job, but the crew is doing as close to a perfect
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:20.880]  job as you can get. And I love them. I want to thank them. I am your host, Alex Jones. I want to
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:25.840]  take a lot of calls in this second hour. And Elora Loomer, who's got a good chance of doing an
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:31.520]  upstart victory against a Democrat in Trump's district there in Palm Beach. She had big Skype
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:35.600]  problems last Friday, so she's going to be popping back in with us today. Other than that,
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:42.880]  we've got open phones. If you just joined us, I've got hundreds of incredible articles, dozens of
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:47.840]  incredible videos, but I'm sorry, I've got to recap our top news. China's holding military
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:53.200]  invasion drill and admitting they may invade Taiwan and or Hong Kong. They're threatening to even
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:59.040]  take islands away from the Philippines and the Japanese and are threatening to attack with missiles
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:03.360]  any U.S. ships that enter the disputed waters, which is most of the South China Sea.
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:14.640]  This is insane bravada. Meanwhile, even the nation comes out and exposes, even the liberals,
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:22.160]  that Bill Gates, wealth has gone up since he went tax exempt 20 years ago, over $150 million.
[1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:31.760]  He takes his profits, puts them in tax exempt foundations that invest in private corporations
[1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:37.920]  that he holds controlling stakes in. You're only allowed to do that if you're ultra rich, folks.
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:41.280]  A regular billionaire, we got arrested, we did that, but a regular billionaire almost pays no
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:51.120]  taxes. It came out, Jeff Bezos paid no taxes this year or last year. I pay more taxes than Jeff Bezos,
[1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:56.480]  because I don't make what a professional baseball player makes. All these rumors that
[1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:01.760]  have his fabulous wealth and all this crap. No, I put my money into the operation. But what I'm
[1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:08.880]  getting at is, imagine I pay more taxes. Okay, a guy that owns a small restaurant that maybe makes
[1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:15.520]  $200,000 a year, he pays 40% in the federal, pays local tax, state tax, property tax,
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:23.520]  paying about 65%. So he's keeping 80 grand and that's supposedly upper middle class today.
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:29.520]  Okay? He pays more than Jeff Bezos, but Jeff Bezos funds Black Lives Matter for hundreds of
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:34.320]  millions of dollars, just like Tim Cook is. What's Tim Cook worth? I know last time I checked like
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:42.960]  20 billion or something. It's a joke, folks, but oh, they're liberal and oh, America's bad and
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:49.120]  oh, the police are bad and oh, Trump's bad. And then he gets $4 and change on every package
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:55.760]  shipped through the USPS under a loophole in federal law. We don't get that here
[1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:00.560]  because the law is written where you've got to be doing billions in business till you get it.
[1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:07.280]  Do I get, oh, I'm sorry, we can't do free shipping all the time. We don't get taxpayer financed.
[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:13.920]  Because see, there is no free lunch. When you get that free shipping from Amazon,
[1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:21.840]  you paid for it in taxes. And I'm not even attacking Amazon. I'm just saying it's absolutely
[1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:26.160]  insane. There it is. American billionaires, including Jeff Bezos and Tesla founder Elon
[1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:30.160]  must have gotten $290 billion richer since the start of the pandemic because the whole thing
[1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:36.240]  was actually worried out to only let them operate. Now to Elon Musk credit, he says it's a tyranny,
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:44.480]  a takeover. He doesn't like it. But all the others love it. And this other huge news.
[1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:50.960]  Got to give credit to the Australian news. Australian news, ABC. That's the state-run
[1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:57.280]  media over there and on our ABC. And there are other big stations, other big papers,
[1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:02.560]  WHO, backflips on virus stands by condemning lockdowns. All of it just says it's a fraud,
[1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:06.880]  it's killing the economy, it's driving millions. Wow. Instead of just implementing the lockdown
[1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:10.240]  and then getting money to feed people after they cause the crisis, they're actually,
[1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:16.560]  they're head on voice saying it's got to stop. Wow. Pigs fly. But I mean, you are talking about
[1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:22.400]  Hitlerian level murder. I mean, forget Hitlerian. This is going to kill more than Hitler.
[1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:29.600]  Malice level killing here. Corbillable indicates tell the UN and China how to run the scam.
[1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:34.320]  They run the scam and then all hell breaks loose. So that is absolutely huge news.
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:41.920]  Now I've got all this campaign news and all the COVID-19 news and I've got a bunch of video clips
[1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:46.640]  and things I want to get to. There's so much we're going to be covering here today. But let's start
[1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:53.120]  doing your phone calls. Tristan and Todd and Joe and Henry and CC and Tom and Cruz and Jonathan
[1:07:53.120 --> 1:08:00.320]  and Jay and Patriot. The toll free number to join us is 877-8789 Alex on this live Monday,
[1:08:00.320 --> 1:08:06.080]  October 12 transmission 21 days out from the election. You can talk about the UN admission
[1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:10.720]  that the COVID lockdown is a weapon to, to, to, to, to starve people to death. You can get into
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:15.360]  what you think Trump's up to. You can get into what you think of the economy, what you think the
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:20.000]  dirty tricks are the left's going to pull, what you think of Biden degenerating. I've got videos
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.280]  affect that. Did I tell you those videos guys where Biden doesn't even know where he is in
[1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:27.440]  these new videos? I think I forgot to show those to you. I've got them right here. It's all coming
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:35.440]  up. But just whatever you want to talk about, it's like the Ted Nugent song. It's a free for all.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:42.720]  It's a free for all. So let's go ahead and take a call from who's been holding the longest. That
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:55.360]  would be Tristan in Oregon. Welcome. Hi Tristan. Hey, can you hear me? I can brother. Alrighty.
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:09:02.400]  So yeah, I'm a high school senior here in Oregon. I'd like to first start off by saying being somebody
[1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:08.480]  who actually lives in Oregon with all the craziness in Portland, I can tell you it's real. All right.
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:13.280]  But the New York Times said nothing happened. They said it's peaceful.
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:18.720]  Yeah, no, no, it's definitely not. Every time I've gone up to Portland,
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.160]  it's been one thing after another. But I got the sir, I've got the New York Times right here.
[1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:25.840]  It says it doesn't exist, sir. You heard Nadler. He said it doesn't exist.
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:32.720]  Yeah. And another thing. I don't know if you if you see me exact article, but recently
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:39.200]  a statement came out, I believe it was the Secretary of Defense who said that they had
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:45.440]  been receiving intelligence that foreign operatives were training left wing groups like Antifa to
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:50.000]  stage an organized armed resistance within the US. And they tried to bury the article. You can't
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.840]  hardly know. I didn't see that article. In fact, guys, reprint that. What was the Headline Secretary
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:58.000]  of Defense says, says leftist radicals being trained by foreign powers. And I think they were
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:03.200]  saying ISIS and China were involved, right? I believe that was that was the case. And well,
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:09.040]  sir, I can tell you that it's mainstream news. They caught them. Thousands of Antifa fighters
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:16.560]  went to fight alongside the Kurds against Assad in the last seven years. And so that goes on as well.
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:24.160]  Yeah. And you can't it's hard to find the article anymore. I imagine that they tried to bury it
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:30.720]  a little bit. But particularly here in the Northwest, it's kind of where groups like Antifa.
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:37.360]  Well, I'll tell you what I've been seeing pop up in in like LA Times and mainstream news for 25 years.
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:45.840]  First time I saw it was 1996. I guess it's about 24 years was LA Times containers full of AK-47s
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:52.960]  and hand grenades seized coming in from in Costco containers from China. Well, we've confirmed
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:56.480]  that's always reports few months ago. And I checked with sources inside federal law enforcement,
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:02.720]  they confirm they are they are finding guns from China full auto that have been shipped into crime
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:06.960]  gangs around the country. What do you make of that? I believe I've seen that as well. And that kind
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:12.640]  of mirrors something that happened. I believe it's Boise. There was a protest a while back.
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:18.560]  And pallets of bricks are just coming up on the side of the road. But that's that's been
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:22.320]  happening all over the country for some time now. And they don't like to address that.
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:26.560]  And they tried to deny that and they found one innocent guy that put bricks out
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:30.720]  to then go to him and say, oh, none of it's really happening BS. They're delivering bricks,
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.280]  they're delivering shields, they're delivering clubs from George Soros funding groups and groups
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.360]  funded by Jack Dorsey. Appreciate your call, brother. All right, I got to one call that segment.
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:45.760]  I'm trying to get to four or five next segment. Up next when we come back will be Todd, Henry,
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:52.960]  Joe, CC and many, many others. Please don't forget there is seven days left now in the info wars

[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:53.520]  You are the resistance, the resistance, the resistance. The future isn't coming. It's here.
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:13:00.480]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence
[1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:05.600]  is going to be your most valuable asset. In fact, it's going to be your only asset,
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:12.320]  the world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:19.280]  endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:27.040]  and complete dehumanization. Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:34.800]  biological way by the year 2050. This is their stated goal. I'm sorry to have to report horrifying
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:40.720]  things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:46.800]  the enemy. We turn this around. You must study their own writings. You must face the facts and
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:52.720]  you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed. The Bible talks about
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:58.480]  there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:05.120]  the one world leader, the Antichrist. And he has a beast system that no one can buy and or sell
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:09.120]  unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the palm of their hand. And we look back
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:15.440]  on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that even if we believe in God
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:22.240]  or prophecy, giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:27.600]  to track everything we do. He's not just a recipe. It's a blueprint for total enslavement. And now
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:33.360]  you look at Bill Gates. You look at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats. We should
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:38.800]  decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get. We're technocrats
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:43.600]  we know best. We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you. You
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:49.200]  snap your fingers. We're here. They're just rolling it out. And a lot of people are complying with
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:59.200]  it. It's insane. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:31.200]  That's right. We're made strong by God on our own strength.
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:41.840]  Spirit. The spirit isn't with you. You're dead. If you have a spirit, you live forever.
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:52.080]  There's all I'll ever have. I don't know. Somebody didn't tell the German police.
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:02.080]  Because the New York Times and Congressman Nadler says there's no such thing as Antifa.
[1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:06.160]  It doesn't exist. But I mean, this is an article. This went up on infowars.com with video.
[1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:13.520]  German police raid Antifa squad house in Berlin. Infowars Europe report from the scenes of a
[1:16:13.520 --> 1:16:18.400]  class between German police. That's your reports.com and Antifa in Berlin.
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:23.520]  At authorities evicted dozens of left-wing radicals from a squad house that had been
[1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:32.480]  occupied for decades. Decades. German MP Peter Birston explains that 2,500 officers were deployed
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:38.960]  in the capital to mitigate violence riots by Antifa who had summoned reinforcers around Europe
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:47.040]  for a weekend of retaliatory chaos. It's a bunch of drug addicts that just sit around having sex
[1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:53.040]  all day and everything else you can imagine. A bunch of perverts. I mean, let me tell you,
[1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:58.480]  how many Antifa leaders have been busted being pedophiles? One written house killed after he came
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:05.440]  after him, you know, was a convicted child rapist. 10, 9, 8 year olds. I mean, just, I mean,
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:09.440]  I said on the video, that looks like a pedophile. I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:14.320]  I'm not saying she's a gold digger, but she ain't getting with no, I mean, you know,
[1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:19.440]  I ain't saying he's a pedophile. He just sure as hell looks like one.
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:27.280]  These people are sick, man. They all look like Brian Stelter. You know, like that little flash
[1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:34.240]  cards for kids like that's a lion. That's a seal. That's a puppy. That's a whale. You know, that's a,
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:41.120]  that's a, that's a bear. That's a chicken. That's a pedophile. That's a demon pervert.
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:45.520]  That's a psychotic. I mean, I'm not saying he's a pedophile. I'm just saying I was going to cast
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:50.880]  money for being a pedophile in a movie. I mean, or hit the clown without makeup. I mean, look at
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:56.800]  that totally self unaware, total creep. I was like, you know, women just run from him. Imagine,
[1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:00.240]  because I watched the videos. He'll walk into it like a party at a Hollywood deal where they've
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:05.360]  got footage of cameras going and he'll literally walk around making this weird crazy smile,
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:11.040]  bugging his eyes out. And you just see people like partying away from like, who's this? Well,
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:19.360]  it's Chuckie the clown. Look at that. And that's what CNN thinks we want to watch.
[1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:25.520]  I'm sorry. All right. I'm going off on a Brian Stelter rant.
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:34.400]  Oh my God. Just, just let him babysit your kids. You know, there's no problem.
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:41.600]  All right. I'm going to shut up. Let's talk to Mike who's calling from Texas is active duty
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:45.280]  and the Navy has a comment and all this. Go ahead and we'll go to Todd and everybody else.
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:53.280]  Yeah. I just, I just want to say, Alex, what we're seeing right now, it's not going to end on
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:59.440]  January 20th or January 1st, 2021. Everyone's like, well, you know, Mike, this year is just
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:04.320]  a really crazy year. I understand that, but it's just relative to us. There's been crazier years
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:08.720]  in human. I agree. This is a launch of a global takeover of the nation state. This is just the
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:13.120]  beginning. I'm just saying for benchmarks, 21 days from now is just the beginning. It's
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:18.240]  an auguration that matters in a hundred days. Yeah, absolutely. And so, so what I see happening
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:24.000]  after election, when our loses, things are going to continue to escalate, whether people like it
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:28.960]  or not. I mean, the only, only good thing is if President Trump, if he uses the 14th amendment,
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:33.200]  police section three, the insurrection act against the criminals and traders within the
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:37.680]  government, mayor, by the way, I'm totally against the police state. It's not a police state if foreign
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:40.640]  powers are trying to overthrow your country to arrest their ass. That's what you're supposed
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:46.400]  to do. The police state is letting the foreign power overthrow you. Absolutely. So, so what I
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:51.440]  see happening, unless they use the insurrection act against the, the traders and mayors, governors,
[1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:58.000]  and even in like Congress to lock them up for what they've done to our country and even lying
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:02.640]  against the president to get a duly elected president out. Although the attempted coup is all
[1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:08.720]  confirmed, salty classified. Yes. So if that stuff doesn't happen, this stuff will continue to
[1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:13.120]  escalate. So what? Well, I agree with you. That's the problem. If Barr doesn't do something, if
[1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:17.600]  others don't do something, it green lights them to continue to launch more coup attempts, which
[1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:22.880]  then makes you aiding and abetting them bare minimum dereliction of duty. And Trump's saying
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:27.840]  arrest them. Trump's saying arrest Obama. Trump's saying, Trump is saying, arrest them all. And,
[1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:32.320]  and Hayden goes, Oh, you a whole back, you know, I mean, well, what does he expect them to do?
[1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:35.920]  They're trying to destroy Trump, destroy America. We're supposed to just sit here and take it.
[1:20:35.920 --> 1:20:42.160]  Yeah, absolutely. And what we've been seeing since the George Floyd riots is basically
[1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:49.120]  Kristallnacht in the USA, where in Nazi Germany in 1938, you had the brown shirt break in and
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:55.040]  round up thousands of Jewish men in a number of days. And we've been seeing this in a number of
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:59.360]  months. And, you know, I had the question, you know, when we look back in history, a hundred
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:04.320]  years from now, are we going to see that during this time where our Americans actually be rounded
[1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:08.960]  up? We don't know that yet. But we do have FEMA. Did you hear, did you hear Keith Oberman saying I
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:12.960]  want to arrest all the supporters? I want to destroy them. I want to annihilate them. I want
[1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:19.120]  Amy Cohen Barrett in prison. I did. And if we're not smart about this, at an individual level,
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:25.040]  we can't just rely on the president. We have to educate each other. I, I, I implore every American
[1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:30.160]  to carry a cheat sheet with them to basically show, okay, all right, what is actually happening?
[1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:33.680]  Well, you don't have to trust me if you're trying to explain this to someone at work,
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:37.440]  if someone at a restaurant or a police officer. Well, let me ask you this. How many people,
[1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:44.480]  you know, in the Navy, you know what's going down? Not, not, not enough. And if, and if they do,
[1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:49.840]  they're not talking about it. Well, and I get normally keep your head down. But in a climate
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:53.920]  like this, that's going to get us destroyed. We've got to speak out. We've got to take action.
[1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:57.600]  And I'm going to tell you a lot of liberal police, I know, have woken up a lot of people. I know
[1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:01.920]  their feds, their liberals have woken up. I mean, I think there's a big wake up call. We see it
[1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:06.880]  in the polls. We see it with Hispanic and black voters are waking up. But, but I agree with you.
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:10.880]  We're all in grave danger. God bless you, Mike. Keep it up. All right, I'm going to go to break.
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:15.200]  Come back. Go to a bunch of your calls. But right now, let's go out to break since we mentioned it
[1:22:15.200 --> 1:22:21.280]  with Keith Oberman foaming at the mouth saying that, Oh, defeating Trump's not enough. We've
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:25.360]  got to eradicate his base. So you talk about hit Larry and this is it.
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:34.560]  Trump can be and must be expunged. The hate he has triggered the Pandora's box he has opened,
[1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:42.720]  they will not be so easily destroyed. So let us brace ourselves. The task is twofold. The terrorist
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:48.720]  Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box. And then he and his
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:55.040]  enablers and his supporters and his collaborators and the Mike Lee's and the William bars and the
[1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:59.840]  Sean Hannity's and the Mike Pence's and the Rudy Giuliani's and the Kyle written houses
[1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:06.240]  and the Amy Coney Barrett's must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:12.720]  while we try to rebuild it and to rebuild the world. Trump has nearly destroyed by turning
[1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:19.520]  it over to a virus. Again, they lost all of it. Even as we dream of a return to reality and safety
[1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:25.280]  they wanted to collapse our forefathers died that the fight is not just to represent our forefathers
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:30.960]  but to win it by enough to chase at least for a moment Trump and the maggots. Overman,
[1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:35.120]  I promise you this. If you get the violent revolution you want buddy, you're going to be
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:39.760]  begging for your mommy. I guarantee you Oberman is going to get what he asked for of this kicks
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:44.080]  off. Oberman, you better put your head between your knees and kiss your ass goodbye if you're
[1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:48.160]  successful. There's a real violent revolution. You know where you're going buddy and it's under
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:54.320]  the earth. This is your last chance to get a pack power stack and I'm really bummed out about that.
[1:23:54.320 --> 1:23:58.720]  It started out as a sleeper product but the people that did order it loved it and sort of
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:03.440]  reordering it. They spread the word and became one of our best sellers but because of the COVID
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:08.640]  supply chain breakdown and because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack we are

[1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:24.080]  amazing. I don't have time to go into everything that's in it but this gets people to remember to
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:28.000]  take it and that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is absolutely

[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:58.960]  about their planetary goals. They want private corporate governance above nation states above
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:06.320]  religious institutions above the family. They want total corporate power. There was a great film
[1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:12.960]  back in the early 1970s called rollerball with James Kahn and it's based on a novel set in the
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:19.840]  year 2020 and in the book you have mega corporations that control the planet and there are no longer
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:26.880]  nation states. There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations. If you actually
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:32.880]  read what the most group of the CFR and the lateral commission say in the year 2020 that is their
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:39.120]  end game that is their goal. So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:45.040]  very very ruthless people to see us as shadow. They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:52.720]  common to China as their model. We must reject it now. 2020electioncenter.com. Just type it in

[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:28.800]  finally figured this out since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech and
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:32.160]  then he's modern the situation. Well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're going
[1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:36.960]  to sit here and cry because he has taken action. We the people are taking action now and you can

[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:32.640]  the air hi how are you uh sir i'm very optimistic things are bad but we're turning the corner i
[1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:38.960]  think what do you think um yeah i mean it's it's looking good i mean i know that they are really
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:43.680]  scared of what trump's doing and you can just see the fear in their eyes exactly shift and all of
[1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:47.200]  them know they're a bunch of dirty crooks they're scared which makes them dangerous but they also
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:52.960]  now know that they're not invincible anymore and they've also tested us and learned their threats
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:56.720]  and stuff doesn't work it only pisses us off now they're starting to figure out they're in a real
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:29:02.240]  fight do you like that don't you well yeah the people that are afraid of them will do anything
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:08.000]  to make the pain stop what they really want is a better life the better way to do that is just go
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:12.720]  the way that we're trying to go and i think that they're gonna realize that tree market capitalism
[1:29:12.720 --> 1:29:18.400]  human empowerment worldwide and and we will lift every culture up it's an absolute fact they admit
[1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:24.800]  that they're trying to suppress that absolutely absolutely and i wanted to take a second to say
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:31.200]  that i try i've been taking your x2 for a while now and it was the first product of yours that i tried
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:36.960]  and uh i mean i'm not just saying this after the first time i'm trying it it's absolutely cured i had
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:41.920]  a stomach issue and uh i think you might have had something to do with you know just not getting the
[1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:48.240]  right halide in my system and it just from day one it actually completely changed well look big
[1:29:48.240 --> 1:29:52.640]  pharma doesn't want this known because they're evil they're globalists if you go back to almost
[1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:56.400]  all the big pharma nothing against germans but it was german and british and it was all the
[1:29:56.400 --> 1:30:01.520]  Rockefellers they were eugenicists and so they don't want you to know that most of the illness
[1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:06.320]  is caused by deficiencies but they have to tell you the medical literature on the cdc website
[1:30:06.320 --> 1:30:11.360]  and the nih that if you don't have vitamin c you die don't have iodine clean iodine you die
[1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:14.880]  don't have vitamin d you die and even fauci has been forced to admit it but listen
[1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:21.200]  of any virus is going to kill you if you don't have enough if something's essential like oxygen
[1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:24.400]  or water you got to have it well it's the same thing with these vitamins and minerals that's why
[1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:30.480]  we've got x2 but we got x3 when i forget to take this i feel it describe for folks they didn't know
[1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:34.320]  what this is like because you never know what you're going to get hit by with a deficiency
[1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:40.320]  how long you took x2 before you saw the difference it happened immediately i know it
[1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:46.240]  sounds like a gimmick but i i put a comment on your site a while back and it was actually x3
[1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:51.760]  that was the first product that i got and from the first day the minute the second that it got in
[1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:56.000]  my system i wasn't expecting it to do anything for my stomach you kept talking about how great
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:59.520]  it you know was for virility i was like hey you know what you know i can use some of that why not
[1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:05.040]  you know and uh i took it and it my stomach problem just went away immediately i said that
[1:31:05.040 --> 1:31:10.000]  can't be that's weird that's got to be temporary and um it wasn't i've been on it for the better
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:15.840]  part of a year now it's unbelievable i mean i don't want to get grabbed it's a family show but um
[1:31:15.840 --> 1:31:22.720]  um i've got more virility and you know let's just say
[1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:30.240]  i mean here's the deal you know i'm like 15 16 i'm like man i'm really well in doubt
[1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:33.360]  by the time i was like 30 something and burned out and tired i'm like man i don't
[1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:37.360]  i mean you know when i get in bed with my wife whatever things aren't like they used to be
[1:31:37.360 --> 1:31:42.160]  man i went on i down within weeks i'm like whoa i'm 15 years old again what the hell
[1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:46.240]  and it's just right then you know wow and then you're like oh yeah but it was all doctor group
[1:31:46.240 --> 1:31:52.160]  explaining to me all of it here's the problem most iodine is bound to something and it's crappy
[1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:56.480]  from where they get it we get a deep breath crystal and so it just absolutely goes right into the
[1:31:56.480 --> 1:32:00.480]  blood here's the problem if you've already got medical issues we're already deficient who knows
[1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:05.040]  what we'll do to you so use a consult a physician this is not a game this is an essential thing for
[1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:09.440]  your body and if you've been deficient in it your body will start using other things that survive
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:13.440]  and who knows what'll happen so everybody should take it very very serious what was your political
[1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:21.520]  point uh dod well i really think that we don't know if the virus is still exists at all um i had
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:27.200]  family members a bunch of family members that got really sick in 2018 at the end and also through
[1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:36.160]  2019 some of them actually almost died and i think that we may have possibly already seen this virus
[1:32:36.160 --> 1:32:42.320]  complete everybody exactly i had family three of them died six years ago the hospitals everywhere
[1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:46.640]  were full of dead bodies this was a real pandemic they covered it up covid 19 as it's known has already
[1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:52.080]  been around for many years it is a simulant for the vaccine it's a live virus vaccine ingredient
[1:32:52.080 --> 1:32:57.200]  that got out and so it's a vaccine four more deadly SARS that is out there that's what the
[1:32:57.200 --> 1:33:03.840]  best money is on is that it's a vaccine ingredient live virus that got out that will kill you if you
[1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:09.360]  don't have enough vitamins and nutrients and again let's expand on that this is this is the most
[1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:15.040]  critical part it has incredible gain of function because it's actually a live virus vaccine a lot
[1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:19.280]  of these vaccines are actually meant to create herd immunity now where they give you a live vaccine
[1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:24.640]  and then you shed the virus does that make sense oh absolutely but my point is that's what it was
[1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:30.400]  when they let it out i mean i think that to your point that you've made before i think that's
[1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:35.280]  already retrograded out completely i don't think it exists anymore that's my honest point absolutely
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:40.560]  if you take the death of flu and pneumonia they're not counting it in europe or here either it's all
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:45.600]  you in control you you take that number add it to covid it fits exactly so they're just counting
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:49.040]  everything as covid god bless you brother all right i got to one call let's get another one in
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:53.440]  there great caller though now i'm telling you folks um i remember dr grip like nine years ago

[1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:32.880]  everything um let's go to henry in illinois henry thanks for holding go ahead hi uh
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:39.040]  elix thanks for taking my phone call thank you brother calling i think we should start using
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:45.760]  um title 18 of the section 242 to prosecute all this illegal unconstitutional mandates for every
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:51.200]  governor health department yeah the supreme court of the illinois excuse the supreme will
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:56.640]  pay that too the supreme court of uh michigan said what whitmer's doing is illegal go ahead
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:00.720]  yeah so we should start doing that we start educating the the public
[1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:07.040]  and and tell them don't be afraid especially the businesses they're so afraid to get uh
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:10.880]  cited by the health department exactly even though the supreme courts have all said don't do it
[1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:16.640]  including texas they just keep doing it because the governors say so yeah and i don't follow that i
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:23.840]  don't wear a mask i'm i'm very uh against the mask also did you know that the cdc is trading on the uh
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:30.960]  stock market i didn't know that i just found out last i did tell folks about that all right so this
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:37.360]  we should start defunding them and take away the tax extent uh the 501 c3 also she started
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:43.440]  prosecuting for fraud and all you wrote a key point the cdc owns a position in most vaccines
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:47.200]  how can you have a government group with shareholders that make money you know you
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:52.160]  know fouchy and gates make money off the cdc right so we should start going after them take away
[1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:59.120]  the tax extent uh that they have and prosecuting for fraud also i think we should start educating
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:05.680]  the people the mask do not protect you or others against any virus because people are so afraid
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:11.920]  oh we're protecting you i said no they're not i call the cdc and i spent two hours on the phone
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:17.200]  and i asked to a supervisor explain to me what is the mask mask does for me oh droplets no i'm
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:21.600]  talking about the virus it does not protect you or others against the virus you have to be
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:27.760]  having equipment of a bio it's a sign of slavery henry you're absolutely right and you're smarter
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:33.040]  than i am we should be targeting fouchy in the fact the cdc is invested and co-owners of the
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:37.360]  damn vaccines is a conflict of interest and it's the key area to strike yeah god bless you all
[1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:44.160]  right cc joe tyler anthony tom jonathan jay and scott your calls are all straight ahead info wars
[1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:52.480]  dot com tomorrow's news today you notice that over and over again the united nations are supposed
[1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:56.800]  controllers and bosses the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with has come
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:03.920]  out and said nothing can treat or prevent covid 19 ladies and gentlemen that's a total lie you get
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:09.440]  a lot of sunlight it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin d3 and it's almost impossible
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:13.920]  to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin d3 if you have zinc and vitamin c as
[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:18.640]  well that's why people get the flues and these colds in the winter because that's on vitamin d
[1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:25.040]  levels plunge now i've pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:29.040]  hope that people should have their vitamins and their minerals well now fouchy's been forced to
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:34.800]  come out and admit that you need vitamin d3 and c he should have also added zinc because the nyh
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:39.840]  website says you die without zinc but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:44.640]  reality because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:50.480]  that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins stand back and stand by during our

[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:02.640]  the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was unamerican now the media admits
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:08.720]  that almost every app in every company that are on apple and on droids don't just track your location
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:15.440]  but your surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all share the data

[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:27.600]  to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of everything
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:32.800]  you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies are

[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:15.120]  from europe wars dot com german police raid antifa squadhouse in berlin it should say dramatic video
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:22.240]  see the dramatic video of german police raiding antifa squadhouse in berlin this is exclusive
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:29.760]  info wars video eight minutes of it and i'm watching this this is powerful that's the problem
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:35.280]  with info wars dot com it over delivers i can't even keep track of all the stuff and the reporters
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:40.400]  we've got in europe we got three reporters in europe we got three reporters in the uk we got
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:45.680]  ten reporters here in the us and that's where you're financing and so much more goes so thank you all
[1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:50.640]  for the great work you do but i mean i i didn't have no idea we even have all this it's like
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:56.560]  incredible footage for radio losers you can find it in info wars dot com okay let's just race through
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:02.000]  your calls right now because i gotta guess come up with calls as well we've got a lawyer on covid
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:08.560]  and court systems tying into what the last caller was saying jordan in new jersey as a lawyer what's
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:15.360]  your view on this hi alex i don't want to take too much time thank you for pushing me in i've
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:20.240]  heard a lot of the callers coming in about what we should do this with the court system and if you
[1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:24.560]  look at the very you know blogs that still kind of report the truth and have a collective knowledge
[1:42:24.560 --> 1:42:29.280]  kind of like what your site does like jim festers blog and so forth at least some of the contributors
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:36.080]  there sure um there there is a the court system in places like uh where the worst that this is
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:43.920]  going on like new jersey you know canada kit new york michigan they're shut down um they're operating
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:51.440]  maybe by 26 percent um if someone goes down to a courthouse right now and they have an emergent
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:57.360]  case where their civil rights are being violated you can't get into the courthouse to file anything
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:02.160]  that's right the system is carrying out siege against us while they take our rights they close
[1:43:02.160 --> 1:43:09.200]  the courts and our access to go challenge this it's it's it's true fascism yes it is and everybody
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:14.080]  needs to know that the normal court procedures and what we used to think of the rule of law is
[1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:21.200]  completely shut down and people have to be made aware of this in spate um i just can't tell you

[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:32.160]  started thinking like all of these topics that we're all talking about there are distractions to
[1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:39.600]  what i think most of us are all waiting for which is the outcome to this jeffrey ebbstein thing
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:45.600]  i agree and and every time they get a little bit closer like these emails being dumped now
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:51.440]  that we all can read every time we get a little bit more closer to the reality of this
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:47:00.160]  pedo satanic uh whatever sex trafficking whatever they got going on over there every time we get more
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:08.880]  info oh the covet increase lockdowns uh trump versus whoever with the elections there are
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:13.520]  distractions to where we're all waiting ma'am ma'am i'm so glad you called don't hang up cc
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:18.800]  gonna give you the floor for a few minutes but hundreds of times the last year i've been driving
[1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:23.680]  into work saying what should i start the show with the last eight months really and it's that
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:28.000]  they're the globalist are panicking we're awake to them we're exposing their pedofall rings
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:33.600]  now they're doing the siege and lockdown to distract us from the fact that their house
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:40.720]  of cards is coming down and you called and made the point please continue yeah um and i just i'm
[1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:46.480]  sick and by it and every day i wake up looking for a headline of who's gonna get arrested or who
[1:47:46.480 --> 1:47:51.920]  so now bar he has to make these arrests you know trump's telling them to press forward with the
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:57.040]  arrest that anybody's paying attention we know it has to be something has to be involved with
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:02.560]  those emails that's better out so what are those emails that i mean is anybody talking about that
[1:48:02.560 --> 1:48:09.360]  because i haven't read anything about what those emails contain well they're releasing official
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:13.920]  statement department emails as they go through them and i don't think you're gonna see the real meat
[1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:18.160]  potatoes come out trump has ordered them released he knows they have the full list but their own
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:22.720]  bureaucracies are too scared because they're too blackmailed uh to do it but i mean it's what's in
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:28.560]  there is paper play it's foreign governments and individuals paying her foundation has even come out
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:33.280]  in some of the emails previously and wiki leaks where they give her foundation a million dollars
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:38.080]  she literally gives them a concession that they wanted the state department so so so that's what's
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:45.200]  in there well that's what i'm waiting on and that's the big that's the that's the big ahunus for me
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:50.400]  you know all of this other stuff is all a big distraction yeah we got the covid yeah we got
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:56.160]  the lockdowns oh it's airborne it's not airborne it's just so much you can't keep up with what's
[1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:03.200]  going on from day to day it's causing everybody's stress which is exactly what they want to cause
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:10.240]  and create chaos remembering this is a spiritual war we we've all forgotten that caught up in the
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:16.320]  elections caught up in all this other stuff that this is so much bigger than what we even talk about
[1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:20.560]  on the day exactly and when we all get frustrated by the evil and the corruption of them suppressing
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:24.320]  us give it to god and realize that what's happened to us is nothing compared to what happened to
[1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:28.960]  unborn babies they already born babies and then it's up to us to turn it over to god and tell god
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:34.160]  to tell us what to do and be humble and that god lead god and direct us and that that will then
[1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:37.680]  happen but we've got to turn it over that's what i do to myself every day now i just pray to god
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:42.960]  and i say god you take control please give me peace so i don't get so mad and so i don't go crazy
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:47.760]  and i think that's the prayer to say do you agree with me i totally agree with you and i see the
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:52.160]  only way to go about it because when they come knocking at your door you said something in the
[1:49:52.160 --> 1:49:56.080]  show a hundred years ago by the way i've been listening to you for over 10 years you said
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:01.920]  something in show years ago when somebody comes knocking at your door ask you whose team are you
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:08.080]  on are you with god or no and at that moment you will be have to answer the question and if they're
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:11.440]  going to blow your head off right then in that moment what are you going to say are you going to
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:17.360]  lie or are you going to just embrace the grace of god in that moment and that's the exactly the
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:22.880]  place that i think we're in right now with the vaccine we're going to be faced with the decision
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:29.920]  to make very soon and i call it in my household the big decision we discuss it as a family what
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:34.560]  are you going to do it is and what do you do to fight so your family doesn't get in that position
[1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:40.160]  but you you saw what happened in kinja five six years ago where the muslims came into the nice
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:44.800]  shopping malls nice as any one we have here kinja is a nice country good christian people
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:50.880]  and and they came in there and they they lined up families and said are you a christian and
[1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:56.000]  they said yes they blew their heads off and the majority of the people who were christian said
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:01.360]  i'm a christian and died that's real courage that's that's to not deny christ i mean i'll be
[1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:05.680]  honest somehow kind of guys putting a gun to my head i'd probably lie to get out of it but but i
[1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:11.920]  get they saw it as a biblical thing of denying christ and didn't do it and and and and you know i'd
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:16.000]  live to fight other day but i gotta say i honor those people because there will become that point
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:20.320]  where you gotta take the microchip which will then take control of your life people you'll just take
[1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:24.560]  the chip folks the chip then governs the decisions you make so you've got to serve the chip and do
[1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:29.680]  evil that's why you lose god and i will not do that i will not take a chip either but somebody
[1:51:29.680 --> 1:51:33.200]  had a gun to me and my kids heads and said denounced christ i'm not gonna lie to you i might do it
[1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:37.200]  but i mean close the close africans they didn't do it they died
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:55.440]  now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iphone simply go to band.video with your

[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:08.720]  uh playing a few minutes of what she's saying right now in the opening day of the hearings
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:24.320]  ranking member feinstein and members of the committee i'm honored and humbled to appear
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:31.600]  before you today as a nominee for associate justice of the supreme court i thank the president
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:37.840]  for entrusting me with this profound responsibility as well as for the graciousness that he and the
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:45.120]  first lady have shown my family throughout this process i thank senator young for introducing me
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:51.280]  as he did at my hearing to serve on the seventh circuit and i also thank senator brawn for his
[1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:59.440]  support and while she could not be with us via uh the satellite i am also grateful to former dean
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:05.440]  patio hara of the Notre Dame law school she hired me as a professor nearly 20 years ago
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:12.960]  and she has been a mentor colleague and friend ever since i thank the members of this committee
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:18.080]  and your other colleagues in the senate who've taken the time to meet with me since my nomination
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:25.760]  it's been a privilege to meet you as i said when i was nominated to serve as a justice
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:32.400]  i'm used to being in a group of nine my family nothing is more important to me and i'm very
[1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:40.560]  proud to have them behind me my husband jesse and i have been married for 21 years he has been a
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:47.920]  selfless and wonderful partner every step of the way i once asked my sister why do you think
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:54.000]  marriage is hard people are always saying that i think it's easy and she looked at me and said
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:59.440]  well maybe you should ask jesse if he agrees with that i decided not to take her advice
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:06.400]  because i know that i am far luckier in love than i deserve jesse and i are parents to seven
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:12.960]  wonderful children our oldest daughter emma is a sophomore in college who just might follow her
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:20.800]  parents into a career in the law next is vivian who came to us from Haiti when vivian arrived
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:27.440]  she was so weak that we were told she might never talk or walk normally but now she deadlifts as much
[1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:35.280]  as the male athletes in our gym and i assure you she has no trouble talking tess is 16 and while she
[1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:40.400]  shares her parents love for the liberal arts she also has a math gene that seems to have skipped her
[1:56:40.400 --> 1:56:48.960]  parents generation john peter joined us shortly after the devastating earthquake in Haiti and jesse
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:54.560]  who brought him home still describes the shock on jp's face when he got off the plane in winter
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:57:02.080]  times chicago once that shock wore off jp assumed the happy go lucky attitude that is still his
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:10.640]  signature trait lamb is smart strong and kind and to our delight he still loves watching movies with
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:18.000]  mom and dad 10-year-old juliet is already pursuing her goal of becoming an author by writing multiple
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:24.480]  essays and short stories one of which she recently submitted for publication and our youngest benjamin
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:30.480]  is at home with friends benjamin has down syndrome and he is the unanimous favorite of the family
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:35.280]  he was watching the hearing this morning i'm told and he was calling out our names as he saw the
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:43.200]  kids in the back my own siblings are here some in the hearing room and some nearby carry megan
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:49.280]  eileen amanda vigan and michael are my oldest and dearest friends we've seen each other through
[1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:56.800]  both the happy and hard parts of life and i am so grateful that they are with me now my parents
[1:57:56.800 --> 1:58:02.960]  mike and linda coney are watching from their new orleans home my father was a lawyer and my mother
[1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:11.280]  was a teacher which explains why i became a law professor more important my parents modeled for
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:19.280]  me and my six siblings a life of service principle faith and love i remember preparing for a grade
[1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:25.680]  school spelling bee against a boy in my class and to boost my confidence my dad saying anything boys
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:32.480]  can do girls can do better and at least as i remember it i spelled my way to victory i received
[1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:37.520]  similar encouragement from the devoted teachers at st mary's dominican my all girls high school in
[1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:43.280]  new orleans when i went to college it never occurred to me that anyone would consider girls less
[1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:51.840]  capable than boys there are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the united
[1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:57.520]  states much less in the entire world info wars is standalone with our own radio and tv satellite
[1:58:57.520 --> 1:59:03.280]  uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up almost no one else has that especially anybody
[1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:09.280]  covering real issues of global populism the right to self-defense and exposing the anti-human
[1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:15.520]  globalist death agenda that's why when we go out and shoot videos they're at band on video
[1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:21.360]  they're not allowed to be on twitter on youtube on facebook that's why it's so precious because
[1:59:21.360 --> 1:59:27.520]  the censorship expands to everyone which it is now with ai monitoring controlling what you can say
[1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:33.360]  and do it's going to be the oasis black band on video and the now redesign info wars dot com
[1:59:33.360 --> 1:59:38.160]  to become more and more important which they are and the enemy is suing us attacking us
[1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:43.600]  hacking us lying about us sabotaging us infiltrating us trying to shut us down right now

[2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:03.760]  charges i said i didn't want charges i i wanted to conduct my civic duty and uh he said your
[2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:10.960]  civic duty is to wear a mask and i i told him i had a letter from my doctor i have a muscular
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:17.840]  disease and it makes it difficult to breathe and i i get very uh dizzy and lightheaded when i have
[2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:22.240]  sure in federal and state law says their regulations are unenforceable but they they must
[2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:26.000]  let you not wear a mask if you claim that you have a medical or psychological
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.640]  issue so what you're saying is they tried to block your right to vote because you weren't wearing
[2:01:30.640 --> 2:01:35.600]  a face diaper yeah they they wouldn't even they wouldn't even look at the letter written from my
[2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:42.080]  neurologist he the guy was really a not nice guy and you get his name and number and you call the
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:48.400]  republican party a lawsuit means we fall right now well i one thing led to another i i called the
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:54.560]  police and another officer went down and got me a ballot and i thought about that and and i thought
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:02:03.920]  about that but and i probably should but nobody let you fill a ballot out outside yes sir yes sir
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:09.600]  wow so and and then and the funny thing is i wasn't the only one there was another vehicle that
[2:02:09.600 --> 2:02:14.400]  rode up and i seen the same woman that brought me my ballot out brought it out for this other woman
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:21.040]  also so but they ought to have some type of a booth set up outside for people that game says
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:26.560]  that the mask never come off they're teaching us to be neurotic be afraid of our own shadows to
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:31.680]  never leave our houses to all work from home i mean we're being taught to be obsolete this is a
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:37.360]  giant psychological wound on humanity so it's your civic duty was to expose the fraud we only

[2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:18.000]  jonathan thanks for holding
[2:06:20.800 --> 2:06:28.720]  hey alec hey jonathan how you doing alec i'm good brother go ahead so i remember you had mentioned
[2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:35.840]  this about six months ago about you trying to start up maybe um a hispanic version of the show
[2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:40.960]  because you know i watched katlyn benes video i think earlier today she dropped it was about
[2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:47.200]  the title i think was what latinos waking up and you know i'm a latino myself and i think it's
[2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:52.400]  you know it's quite exciting seeing that kind of stuff come out because in reality more and more
[2:06:52.400 --> 2:06:58.480]  african-americans more and more latinos mexicans you know i totally agree and the democrats are scared
[2:06:58.480 --> 2:07:03.360]  big political articles out in florida how the majority of hispanics they talked to her going to
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:07.360]  go trump and because they see right through what's going on that's beautiful that that's
[2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:13.440]  that that's scaring the hell out of them what are you saying i mean uh you know being a hispanic
[2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:20.480]  myself and seeing katlyn benes video one of the girls mentioned how you know hispanics really
[2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:27.360]  take a second and look at how their faith and what they're what they believe and that all
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:33.680]  lies with trump and what trump believes in too and and it's really it's kind of sad how you know
[2:07:33.680 --> 2:07:39.280]  these families that have experienced all the the socialism all the the failed countries that have
[2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:43.440]  immigrated here and now they're raising those their children and their children are you know
[2:07:44.160 --> 2:07:50.080]  claim that they they love socialism or they want they want marxism you know it's like
[2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:56.000]  they need to input that family value back into their into their children and into the
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:01.200]  absolutely communism and socialism is run by big mega banks to enslave us and anybody that thinks
[2:08:01.200 --> 2:08:05.760]  otherwise is an idiot we've got problems in america but if we want big problems we need to
[2:08:05.760 --> 2:08:10.240]  let the democratic party take over because trump's running asary says you know communists have taken
[2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:15.200]  over democratic party don't let them take over america it's true that's what this is they're
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:20.000]  putting us under martial law they're trying to lock us in our houses trying to tell jews of all
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:24.880]  groups they picked out of new york they can't leave their houses but everybody else can i mean this is
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:32.240]  crazy town absolute crazy town what else you witnessing jonathan
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:36.240]  already said that more and more banks are starting to wake up more and more are starting to get
[2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:42.080]  involved with with politics and seeing all the human trafficking and you know at first when
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:46.480]  trump had mentioned about the the wall at the border you know people started freaking out but
[2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:50.560]  when they actually took a second to do some research instead of believing the mainstream
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:54.720]  media narrative you know they realized you know the democrats of the deep state are just hauling
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:09:00.160]  across all these children that disappear yeah i mean and that's why they're starting to stand up
[2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:04.960]  like on on topics like that and starting to actually do their own research and a lot of
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:08.720]  them are just starting to wake up and it's just a really good thing that i'm seeing so i bless you
[2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:13.440]  brother thank you so much that's a great that's a powerful point there's a washington post headline
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:21.760]  they hate federal just department finds children brought in under obama's child program put into
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:26.720]  child sex trafficking and so when he did that open the border thing like a third of ended up
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:30.560]  disappearing great points all right amy comey barrett has finished up her speech it was pretty
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:36.080]  lackluster you're about to start the questions but laura lumers coming up from a major battleground
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:44.880]  congressional district trumps district palm beach florida straight ahead stay with us
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:52.880]  the future isn't coming it's here and in the future keeping your humanity saving your soul
[2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:58.560]  your integrity your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset in fact it's going to be
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:04.960]  your only asset the world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:11.040]  is coven 19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past
[2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:19.680]  domestication into total and complete dehumanization human life will be impossible to be carried out
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:27.760]  in an original biological way by the year 2050 this is their stated goal i'm sorry to have to
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:34.000]  report horrifying things like this to you but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:40.720]  decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must study their own writings you must face the facts
[2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:46.800]  and you must come to grips with it you're all being incrementally destroyed the bible talks about
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:52.560]  there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:59.200]  the one world leader the anti christ and he has a beast system that no one can buy and or sell
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:03.760]  unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look back
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:09.520]  on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in god
[2:11:10.160 --> 2:11:16.080]  or prophecy giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:21.520]  sell to track everything we do it's not just a recipe it's a blueprint for total enslave but
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:27.120]  that now you look at bill gates you look at bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:32.400]  we should decide how much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:37.120]  technocrats we know best we're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control
[2:11:37.120 --> 2:11:43.120]  you you snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying
[2:11:43.120 --> 2:12:03.760]  with it it's insane you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:15.600]  wow laura loomer is here from her campaign headquarters in palm beach florida she had
[2:12:15.600 --> 2:12:19.840]  bad sky problems last week because she's back with us now and i wanted to cover the water
[2:12:19.840 --> 2:12:25.440]  from her about her campaign that was she's seeing on the ground polls showed her way ahead of the
[2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:30.080]  other republicans she won't even bigger than what they said now she's ahead in many polls against
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:34.720]  the democrats she's running against they are in full panic mode and i was reading a political article
[2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:40.320]  they were panicking that you've got massive hispanic support there that's normally democrat in that
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:45.680]  district i think you're a bellwether of the country of underdogs winning but regardless
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:51.280]  you're in the arena laura loomer give us a report from florida well again thanks so much for having
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:57.280]  me back on alex it's always great to see you and we are 22 days away from congresswoman laura
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:05.520]  loomer becoming a reality so stay tuned get ready like you said the polls were were showing me
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:09.840]  you know being ahead and that's how it is right now too it's a neck and neck race
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:17.760]  i'm i'm you know tooth and nail with lois frankle i believe it's a 46 to 45 percent i of course
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:23.440]  am taking the lead with 46 percent but you won't really see that that's what our internal polling
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:28.560]  is is is showing us and that's what some independent polls that are conducted by individuals who are
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:33.840]  publishing their polling online have been saying as well but then bloomberg of course
[2:13:33.840 --> 2:13:39.440]  has decided to pump in a hundred million dollars into the state of florida and there was this poll
[2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:44.880]  that came out a few days ago from this bloomberg funded company called st peat polls that said
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:51.520]  that i was behind 28 points which is absolutely absurd because you know my volunteers and i we
[2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:56.880]  have knocked on thousands wait a minute bloomberg runs fake polls do bears also go to the bathroom
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:01.920]  in the woods laura yeah i guess i guess we should have known that right someone should have told
[2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:06.000]  them about that when he spent 750 million on his failed presidential race and they said he would
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:11.680]  have beat trump on a landslide but yeah alex this is the state of affairs here and the media has
[2:14:11.680 --> 2:14:17.280]  decided to you know engage in a full-blown blackout on my race so what they're doing is because they
[2:14:17.280 --> 2:14:22.000]  know that i'm i'm actually gaining traction and because i'm winning they're telling people oh
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.720]  she has nothing to say the palm beach post just came out with an endorsement of my opponent two
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:32.480]  days ago and i kid you not they literally said all of these things about lois frankle and in the
[2:14:32.480 --> 2:14:37.200]  article and the only thing they said about my candidacy is well there's not much to say about
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:42.160]  laura loomer the only thing you need to know is that she's banned on facebook twitter paypal chase
[2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:48.160]  bank and uber eats enough said so because i'm banned i don't exist as a as a human being because i'm
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:52.640]  banned i don't get to participate that's what they're saying is they control reality after i got banned
[2:14:52.640 --> 2:14:58.640]  you've done this too i've been in dc and people walk by they go even uh your republican senator
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:02.400]  there uh said this to me he goes you don't exist i don't know who you are but but let's talk about
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:08.880]  this i've seen the numbers that people are way more searching your name than hers uh two to one
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:14.160]  they're searching how to vote republican that how to vote democrat in google searches these are the
[2:15:14.160 --> 2:15:19.280]  type of real numbers that show real engagement uh that show if you don't win its election fraud
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:24.160]  you are in a county famous for that how are you planning to mitigate that problem well it's it's
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:28.480]  interesting that you said that uh because there's already a lot of concerns about uh voter fraud
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:34.000]  here on the here on the ground and i know that the republican party locally uh is getting their
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:38.960]  attorneys and they're getting their poll watchers in place especially uh given the fact that we are
[2:15:38.960 --> 2:15:44.240]  officially one week out from early voting here on the ground in florida um and you know while
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:48.640]  there's going to be a voter fraud all over the country and we're already seeing it we're seeing
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:53.440]  instances of a hundred thousand ballots getting you know sent to wrong addresses or fifty thousand
[2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:58.640]  ballots being thrown out okay uh you know in different parts of the country uh another form
[2:15:58.640 --> 2:16:03.520]  of election fraud and election tampering that's taking place is the suppression of speech by
[2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:08.880]  social media i'm sure you saw today and it's not a coincidence and i think that the timing of it
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:14.640]  is being done to manipulate the florida elections but twitter today came out with a new policy that
[2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:20.880]  said that uh starting in one week from today which is officially october 19th they are going to start
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:27.920]  making it impossible for people to retweet tweets that they deem fake news so for you know for an
[2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:33.600]  example uh just a couple days ago president trump said yeah i'm feeling really great i i got covid
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:39.120]  and i'm recovered and i feel like i'm immune to it twitter put a fake news label on that tweet
[2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:44.320]  okay and so now their rule is that you can't retweet tweets that they deem fake so what's
[2:16:44.320 --> 2:16:48.320]  going to happen in my in my opinion is they're going to have massive amounts of voter fraud in
[2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:52.000]  any single time anybody wants to retweet it or post about it they're not going to let them because
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:56.560]  they're going to say it's fake news so twitter's just going to be like an overwhelming echo chamber
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:02.560]  of radical leftist pro-biden pro-democrat speech and then i've been saying it for over two years alex
[2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:07.360]  i said it when i sat next to you in the congressional hearing when we were yelling at jaff dorsi and
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:12.960]  trying to talk some sense into these do nothing republicans and do nothing democrats but uh i
[2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:16.960]  really do believe that president trump is going to get banned from twitter or at least have his
[2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:22.720]  account locked uh in the days leading up to the election well that leads me to this next point
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:28.960]  you've got two to one searches on google for how to vote republican versus democrat that's a big
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:35.360]  big number that's the headline people can pull up if they like to but bigger than that facebook
[2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:40.320]  twitter google apple they all say oh we're not going to let a winner be declared that day the
[2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:44.000]  numbers show that's the fact we're going to hold it up a few weeks a few months and if trump or
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:49.760]  anybody else tries to declare it we're going to block them so this is election meddling being
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:55.040]  prepared right now how they're in each county too i mean there's you know uh according to our
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:18:00.080]  our sunshine our sunshine laws here of course if you go to the supervisor of elections office you
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:05.360]  are allowed to watch them uh as just as we saw in 2018 with the recount you are allowed to watch
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:12.240]  them open the ballots and you know it's it's it's a process that's uh you know you can view it as a
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:16.320]  member of the public and you know you generally have attorneys from both parties that go in to
[2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:21.680]  observe this process well it's very interesting because on the schedule for palm each county it
[2:18:21.680 --> 2:18:28.560]  has the day after the election and then the fifth of november as well as days for viewing and opening
[2:18:28.560 --> 2:18:33.280]  ballots so the election is supposed to be called on november third why are their dates for november
[2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:38.240]  fourth and november fifth on the calendar you see what i'm saying oh democrats have said their whole
[2:18:38.240 --> 2:18:43.920]  policy but that was you have to make this a campaign issue of election fraud and and and
[2:18:43.920 --> 2:18:47.760]  the fake ballots around the country and how they plan to hold it up that democrat judges
[2:18:47.760 --> 2:18:52.400]  block it i would make it a huge issue of the democrat coup and what they're doing to force
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:57.040]  your name out there but i agree everyone in america needs to contact friends and family in
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:02.240]  florida particularly in your county and your district and and understand that it's people power
[2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:06.240]  now because they were demonizing you that didn't work it made your poll numbers go up
[2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:09.280]  so now they're trying to act like you don't exist well let's make sure that doesn't happen
[2:19:09.280 --> 2:19:17.120]  yeah well well thank you alex and that's why i need uh you know all the info warriors and
[2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:21.360]  all the people watching this and all the american patriots around the country to support my campaign

[2:20:39.840 --> 2:20:43.040]  by the left because you're effective and tell the truth let's come back and take calls about
[2:20:43.040 --> 2:20:49.200]  trump at the big picture in fiction super villains are known as super villains because they have
[2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:55.760]  gigantic huge global plants that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex and
[2:20:55.760 --> 2:21:01.680]  about it told you a year ago back in october of 2019 that a powerful billionaire who controls the
[2:21:01.680 --> 2:21:07.120]  un would roll out a global hysteria and a lot down the planet start millions of people and
[2:21:07.120 --> 2:21:12.160]  would be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that this same
[2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:16.800]  billionaire would say we're all going to work from home now and that this was good to lower the
[2:21:16.800 --> 2:21:22.080]  carbon footprint and the human population you tell me that's crazy you tell me that's a dystopia
[2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:27.680]  you tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book but in reality it really did happen
[2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:33.200]  his name is bill gates and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father
[2:21:33.200 --> 2:21:38.800]  and mother set up more than 60 years ago and we're living in this world bill gates is built
[2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:44.560]  until we start saying no we are bill gates's property it's time to expose bill gates for
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:49.760]  more than a hundred years the rockefeller foundation has worked to establish world government
[2:21:49.760 --> 2:21:54.240]  abolished nation states dumbed down the population by taking control of education
[2:21:54.240 --> 2:22:00.640]  and most importantly taking control of western medicine now they had a bad name by the 1920s
[2:22:00.640 --> 2:22:06.080]  they started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like ibm to continue
[2:22:06.080 --> 2:22:13.440]  on with their eugenics operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by ibm via his
[2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:18.400]  mother on the board of directors to bill gates the third his father of course being had a planned
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:24.080]  parenthood and now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department
[2:22:24.080 --> 2:22:31.120]  in the world every national health system bill gates is in control they have spent a hundred
[2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:36.640]  plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your
[2:22:36.640 --> 2:22:42.480]  body this is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of
[2:22:42.480 --> 2:22:49.680]  dna in your body 2020 election center dot com just type it in one time you've got to save right

[2:22:55.600 --> 2:23:03.440]  most importantly via text message email or by word of mouth because they have banned the links to

[2:23:21.280 --> 2:23:26.000]  he's going to take action once reelected against big tech i mean he's modern situation well we
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:29.680]  know the presence overwhelmed right now so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken
[2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:34.560]  action we the people are taking action now and you can do it very very easily by sharing 2020

[2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:07.120]  the famous sayings from nazi Germany about first they came for this group i did nothing because
[2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:10.320]  i wasn't part of that group but they came for another group i wasn't part of that group i didn't
[2:24:10.320 --> 2:24:15.120]  think either finally they came for me there was nobody there you have to understand i know pretty
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:19.440]  much everybody in the liberty movement worldwide i mean all the top people it's a real honor it's one
[2:24:19.440 --> 2:24:23.680]  of the blessings of this job and everybody's harassed you could be black you could be white
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:27.920]  you could be christian you could be muslim you could be agnostic if you're promoting freedom
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:33.760]  you're going to get banned by big tech in the big medium laura lumbers banned everywhere on uber and
[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:42.080]  on air bnb and in bank accounts and everywhere because she's spunky and smart and aggressive
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:46.160]  and went into congress and confronted people peacefully you know if you're some leftist
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:50.080]  group oh they love you they give you coverage she gets up and mourns about what's happening
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:54.960]  and just politely talks to abinadi or politely goes up and exposes illan omar or
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:25:00.560]  rashid to leave i mean she's been a trailblazer literally because i always get up here i always
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:05.200]  notice a lot of people see what i do they think it must be fake how does jones and info wars
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:09.120]  continue to always be cutting edge looks like asking how is veritas cutting edge
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:13.680]  she's to work at veritas broke a lot of big stuff people that are in the field keep breaking it
[2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:18.880]  it's called hard work and i look at all the things laura lumbers broken that a year later come out
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:25.120]  it's staggering so i want to see her catapulted propelled she's like i want to see you propelled
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:28.640]  into victory i don't care whether you're old whether you're young whether you're christian
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:32.720]  whether you're jewish whether you're german whether you're chinese if you want freedom
[2:25:32.720 --> 2:25:38.720]  we're brothers and sisters and when she just grows in oh by the way they're blocking me oh by the way
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:43.920]  they want to show my bio on the newspaper that's an insult to all of you and i know all of you know
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:49.600]  that but she's not a victim on this show complaining she's reporting to you as a battlefield general
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:55.120]  on what she's going through and asking you in the homeland to support her so let's get into
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:59.520]  trump let's get into the campaign the left senator can test the election what you think
[2:25:59.520 --> 2:26:04.480]  trump needs to do where all this goes and then what you would do because i want to hear about this
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:11.520]  in congress day one to big tech who's been caught perjuring themselves laura lummer right well the
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:16.160]  the number one issue that we need to get a hold of right now in our country is this issue with law
[2:26:16.160 --> 2:26:22.480]  and order and right now the radical left with the help of joe biden and kamala harris of course
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:27.040]  and i have to reiterate this on your program alex because nobody else will talk about it
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:35.440]  the website antifa.com goes directly to joe biden and kamala harris's presidential campaign website
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:39.920]  okay they have had ample time to get this removed if they really wanted to but they don't want to
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:45.200]  because their entire campaign is a dog whistle to the radical left and the insurrectionists in
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:50.480]  this country who are trying to burn down america and like i said nadler said entity if it doesn't
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:56.640]  exist laura yeah well tell that to the family of the trump supporter who was literally shot in the
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:02.320]  head who had his like brain explode on the streets of denver colorado after you know the media let's
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:07.600]  just let's just admit admit admit this for what it is alex okay the media wishes that they could
[2:27:07.600 --> 2:27:12.640]  murder trump supporters okay when when you wait a minute we just had an action nine media person
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:17.840]  murder somebody in in denver two days ago yeah well that's my point the media wishes that they
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:23.200]  could murder conservatives and trump supporters but they can't so they just lie about us on on tv
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:27.600]  and they try to murder our reputations right it's called character assassination so now they're
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:34.240]  literally hiring antifa you know killers and they said that this guy was a security guard and i
[2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:38.960]  don't know if you saw the report that came out yesterday alex but he is not a legitimate security
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:45.680]  guard so this news organization is lying about the fact that he is a licensed contracted security
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:51.360]  guard okay this is all over the media in denver right now so he doesn't really look like a security
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:57.120]  guard sure as hell doesn't dress like a security guard and the tattoo on his arm it's like some
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:02.480]  weird french antifa racist they admit he's a big leftist that bragged about how he was gonna go
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:08.240]  after from supporters they're actually getting people to murder trump supporters in cold blood
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:13.680]  now so we need to get a hold of of this violence that's happening and you know if i was president
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:18.000]  trump i would i would implement the insurrection act hands down alex i think that's what needs
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:23.520]  to be done i think he needs to implement the insurrection act but like i said regardless of
[2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:28.400]  who wins this election on november 3rd or whenever they decide to call the election i do believe
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:33.200]  there's going to be massive amounts of political violence because the radical left is either going
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:39.840]  to uh you know try to assume power if if donald trump loses and they're gonna target and come
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:44.640]  after conservatives and it's going to embolden the radical left to promote their violence uh
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:48.880]  even more than they're doing now and then if trump wins the radical left is just going to try to
[2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:53.680]  burn down america worse than they tried uh during the day of his inauguration when you and i i
[2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:58.640]  remember we were in dc uh the the time of the deportable blocking entrances attacking men
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:05.040]  women and children i saw them beating up children it's on fire i mean it's out of control well
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:10.640]  laura let's talk about this what about michigan where we're the three leaders of the quote militia
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:16.320]  group are antifa BLM and anarchists who said they hate trump and want to kill cops i mean and the
[2:29:16.320 --> 2:29:22.640]  media spun this that these lunatics are conservatives this is another frame up yeah well they lied
[2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:27.040]  and they tried to say that they were proud boys because they're trying to demonize uh the proud
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:32.560]  boys and let me just be the first to say i support the proud boys and i was told by a lot of people
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:36.320]  oh you shouldn't say that you're a congressional candidate it's going to be really supportive as
[2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:41.520]  well they're a good american group that's proud of america and the west and proud to be men and
[2:29:41.520 --> 2:29:46.080]  women should be proud to be women it's a good wholesome group yeah and we shouldn't be demonizing
[2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:51.040]  people and look while i i love and i respect president trump and i agree with uh you know a
[2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:59.040]  lot he messed up when he didn't know and he uh he repudiated them yeah and so uh of course you
[2:29:59.040 --> 2:30:05.520]  know you never see uh the actual true story regarding uh you know these violent attempts to
[2:30:05.520 --> 2:30:10.960]  kidnap people these of course are radical leftists these are anarchists uh had nothing to do with
[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:17.280]  a conservative movement let's just say we're proud to be american and we're proud of our heritage
[2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:22.240]  and we're all i know you you're very open minded about freedom the left of the ones against freedom
[2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:26.160]  they're the ones trying to control speech and try to tell us what to do they're they're the problem
[2:30:27.520 --> 2:30:32.880]  yeah they definitely are and that's all they have is uh you know political violence and
[2:30:32.880 --> 2:30:36.720]  censorship they are full-blown communists and that's what we need to start calling them
[2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:39.840]  you know we shouldn't start calling them the radical left anymore we should just start calling
[2:30:39.840 --> 2:30:43.760]  them communists because you know they always spend they're not communists but at this thing
[2:30:43.760 --> 2:30:48.880]  at denver and everywhere else it's a communist event where it happens yeah no you're you're
[2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:52.720]  absolutely correct and you know you need to give yourself credit for this because people really
[2:30:52.720 --> 2:30:57.200]  should have listened you know imagine the america that we could be living in right now if people
[2:30:57.200 --> 2:31:02.320]  had been listening to your warnings of what would happen nearly 10 years ago alex be an entirely
[2:31:02.320 --> 2:31:08.480]  different country of instead of having people like chris kwomo and uh you know chris wallis and all
[2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:14.560]  these you know do nothing fake news media pundits at fox news and cnn and they're both trash i mean
[2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:20.960]  let's be honest okay fox news is just as you know big of a dumpster fire is cnn or msnbc they both
[2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:26.800]  need to you know just be completely taken down just imagine though if if people like you would
[2:31:26.800 --> 2:31:31.280]  have been amplified in those positions instead you know we could have woken up the masses to what
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:37.040]  is currently happening um and i'm afraid when an existential crisis where the democrats literally
[2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:41.680]  want the end of the country and the dollar that they want literally the united states to be destroyed
[2:31:41.680 --> 2:31:46.080]  which would annihilate almost everyone in this nation they have no idea i mean this is crazy
[2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:53.440]  yeah it's it's absolutely uh you know mind-blowing and you can just see right now the way that the
[2:31:53.440 --> 2:31:58.880]  the democrats are losing their mind during this confirmation hearing uh because you know they
[2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:04.160]  they're gonna do everything in their power to to make sure that a pro-life uh catholic woman who
[2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:10.960]  loves her country um isn't uh isn't selected for the for the supreme court isn't confirmed i mean
[2:32:10.960 --> 2:32:17.680]  the these these people in the radical left um you know their their movement is not only uh
[2:32:17.680 --> 2:32:24.480]  anti-american but it's anti-life okay it's anti-freedom anti-religion and it's you know it's
[2:32:24.480 --> 2:32:29.920]  exactly it's exactly what uh you know these these communist dictatorships and if you look back in
[2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:36.640]  history these uh you know communist regimes uh perpetuated the same exact tactics and i know
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:42.160]  that dinesh jesuza recently just came out with a movie called uh trump card and people are raving
[2:32:42.160 --> 2:32:47.840]  all about it because he breaks this down for people who want to see how antifa and black lives matter
[2:32:47.840 --> 2:32:55.360]  and the democrat party are literally taking cues out of these tyrannical and uh tyrannical regimes
[2:32:55.360 --> 2:33:00.880]  and dictatorships so uh i think that's uh that's a problem is that we don't have a lot of civics
[2:33:00.880 --> 2:33:05.920]  in our schools anymore so people are not learning history and people don't recognize classical
[2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:09.680]  turning when they see it come back on next day we take a few calls with folks that are holding
[2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:14.720]  patiently about covid and the baby boomers and mass mandates and keith oberman saying arrest all

[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:57.040]  and all that oh they love being heroes they buy into the roll well it's so hard to talk to them
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:00.640]  because they don't want to hear it so me and my t-shirt business you start making up covid
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:04.880]  pandemics and the lie shirts and start putting them on bridal orange shirts so you can see them

[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:17.280]  know where to go to find the good information i mean i agree with you that we need to counter the
[2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:22.240]  fact they're using the fear of just microbes to lock society down the democrats admits their plan
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:28.400]  Laura Loomer what would you do in congress about gage wants to keep the hoax there's a real virus
[2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:34.720]  obviously they over exaggerated thank you scott for holding they want to keep this hysteria going
[2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:41.520]  forever what would you do in congress uh well look the numbers don't lie and what they're doing
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:51.600]  is absolutely criminal okay uh the the recovery rate for covid is 99.7 alex and so uh if i was in
[2:39:51.600 --> 2:39:56.240]  congress you know i would be advocating and fighting for the people that's exactly what i'm
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:00.400]  going to be doing the people want fighters in congress who are going to speak up for them and
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:05.360]  say enough of this craziness with the masks they don't keep you safer they don't keep covid away
[2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:09.360]  i mean for crying out loud the presidents of the united states nobody can get near this guy unless
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:13.680]  they have their temperature taken uh they take everyone's temperature before they enter the room
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:19.280]  he doesn't even shake people's hands because he's such a germaphobe okay they like that like he's
[2:40:19.280 --> 2:40:23.360]  got a bowlet and what you just said is true they added all the people that died of something else
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:27.680]  in the cover column and it doesn't matter what you do to prevent it you can still get it the
[2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:31.840]  president of the united states can get covid if covid can find its way inside the white house
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:37.280]  you know you can get it how many people got covid and don't even know they have covid you got a
[2:40:37.280 --> 2:40:40.880]  cough you know you got the sniffles and then you just kind of rest for a few days you don't
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:45.040]  really know what you have there's probably so many people out there alex who had covid and
[2:40:45.040 --> 2:40:49.840]  they don't even realize they have covid and it's devastating you know i was in delray this morning
[2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:54.960]  speaking on the chamber of commerce uh meeting and these democrats they just lie so much about
[2:40:54.960 --> 2:41:01.120]  covid i kid you not my radical democrat opponent and i have the video of this she literally told
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:07.520]  the voters of district 21 that 200 million americans have died from covid i didn't know
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:12.240]  that two-thirds of our country's population were now dead from covid this is so incredible
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:18.400]  biden keeps saying it it's it's not that they're senile they're doing it on purpose saying two
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:25.680]  thirds of america died they are and other politicians are starting to uh you know replicate his
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:32.080]  statements and so i think this is their strategy is just uh to really convince low propensity voters
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:39.200]  or people who may not watch the news or low information trust you know who trust uh politicians
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:43.360]  and everything that they say to believe that 200 million people really have died i mean it's it's
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:50.480]  in case folks don't know that means if you're a family of six three or four dead i mean this is
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:55.840]  insane bs let's take another call here with laura lumar let's talk to tyler and iowa you're on the

[2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:10.960]  moving up then in the 90s with special homeowners plans because they were moving up from their
[2:45:10.960 --> 2:45:16.960]  starter home to their fancy home then last decade we were working on annuities life insurance because

[2:45:43.040 --> 2:45:50.080]  fouching just like the medieval times the astex the astronomers knew that an eclipse was coming
[2:45:50.080 --> 2:45:57.200]  and they would use that that that unusual thing happening to scare the population the government
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:02.640]  but we're you were right alex we're not out of this now for the next 18 years we're going to have
[2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:09.040]  an annually increasing number of deaths you know they're going to call it covid-19 which does
[2:46:09.040 --> 2:46:13.840]  target people that are old and do not have enough vitamins minerals exactly this is the case for
[2:46:13.840 --> 2:46:19.440]  killing granny this is the actuary to not let old people get their investments and their insurance
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:24.000]  and the average old person will buy the hype and wear the mask not knowing they're actually being
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:30.640]  killed they're in the i mean alex i got family members i mean i got i got i got younger siblings
[2:46:30.640 --> 2:46:36.480]  they're on their 40 they are scared out of their mind now the sad part is i'm i'm i'm not going to
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:41.440]  door 60 years old i've got seven and i'm the oldest of four i got siblings and they're 40 and even in
[2:46:41.440 --> 2:46:46.480]  the 30 they're scared on the mind and by the way they got more health problems than me you know why
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:52.720]  they got into drugs years ago they eat at mcdonald's and all this other garbage plus they don't take
[2:46:52.720 --> 2:46:58.080]  the supplements like i take from info wars dot com all right that's another thing for another day the
[2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:06.160]  point is we've got these these deaths this this tsunami of deaths are coming for the next 18 years
[2:47:06.160 --> 2:47:11.920]  and the government if it's not covid-19 they'll come up with covid-21 or some other oh you're
[2:47:11.920 --> 2:47:17.280]  absolutely right i mean here's the deal sure we sell stuff it's got vitamin d3 and zinc big deal
[2:47:17.280 --> 2:47:21.920]  that that is not part of our business model our business model is freedom and to fund that but
[2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:26.400]  when fouchy came out and said you got to have vitamin d3 and zinc and and and and vitamin c everybody
[2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:31.760]  freaked out they're like wait we thought you were lying it's essential and you literally cannot
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:36.080]  die if you have high levels of that from a virus you may have a heart attack you may get a cancer
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:40.320]  or something else but you're not dying from a damn virus if you have it it's why it's essential
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:46.880]  go to the NIH website it says if you don't have d3 zinc and c viruses can replicate in the nuclei
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:52.960]  and kill you so i'm up here saying this immediately jones is a kook the ewin does not say you need
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:59.040]  vitamin d3 well if the un said plants don't need sunlight i wouldn't buy and do it thank you so
[2:47:59.040 --> 2:48:06.720]  much mark 30 seconds laura lumar comments on what he said uh well you know i i think that uh he's
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:11.840]  right there's definitely uh you know some type of plot to kill the older generations here in our
[2:48:11.840 --> 2:48:16.400]  country and i do think that a lot of that has to do with our political year and i think that
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:22.480]  the radical left wants older people to die a lot of the time because they are more conservative
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:27.760]  politically so everything about this virus has been inherently political morris stay there you
[2:48:27.760 --> 2:48:42.160]  just made me think of something big the answer to 1984 is 1776
[2:48:47.600 --> 2:48:49.600]  info wars has been banned
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:49:03.760]  and arrested attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:14.320]  go to band dot video download the videos and share support the information war at infowarstore.com
[2:49:14.320 --> 2:49:23.120]  and never give up the fight
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:40.240]  info wars dot com info wars is a archetypal classic example of free independent organic
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:46.080]  resistance against tyranny you built info wars you spread the word you prayed for us
[2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:52.160]  you bought the products you called in you made recommendations info wars is as much yours as
[2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:57.280]  it is mine and that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming under all the dnc
[2:49:57.280 --> 2:50:02.800]  lawsuits under all the attack in many ways we become stronger with band dot video the redesigned
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:09.200]  info wars with all of our great crew with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and
[2:50:09.200 --> 2:50:15.280]  tv a day we are the resistance you are the resistance so remember this arsenal of freedom
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:21.200]  is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:25.920]  this is something we built together it's not just a national treasure it's a treasure worldwide
[2:50:25.920 --> 2:50:30.160]  against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it and as everything we talked about comes
[2:50:30.160 --> 2:50:38.960]  true our credibility only goes up together so i salute you all you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:46.960 --> 2:50:51.760]  powerful mega corporations did not want the united states as a model of freedom
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:57.120]  to challenge the tyranny they were building so they put malisades on empower in 1949
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:01.040]  but of the weathermen and communist movements the united states the taxpayer funding at the major
[2:51:01.040 --> 2:51:08.240]  universities to teach kill anyone above the age of 30 kill your parents as bill errs mentor to
[2:51:09.840 --> 2:51:16.240]  obama taught yes that's what we're talking about kill all the rich people break up their cars and
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:24.320]  apartments bring the revolution home kill your parents that's where it's really at well i got
[2:51:24.320 --> 2:51:30.160]  an idea buddy you didn't get our guns how about you die bill errs has been on the show before
[2:51:31.280 --> 2:51:36.000]  let's go back to laura lumber laura you were saying it right there this is the satanic vision
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:43.280]  kill your parents led by bill gates yeah look i i i think that this is something that's you know a
[2:51:43.280 --> 2:51:47.360]  lot of people may say it's far out there but it's something that i originally thought of and it really
[2:51:47.360 --> 2:51:54.560]  hit uh home when i saw quomo uh who is now literally locking up the jews in new york uh shove
[2:51:54.560 --> 2:51:59.040]  infected oh yeah let's bring that up the commies can march black lives matter can go shut down
[2:51:59.040 --> 2:52:05.440]  baptist churches but the jews after eight months wear their mask come outside and they're arresting
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:13.680]  them i mean why is why is meatball komo going after jews why is the blasio the democrat party is
[2:52:13.680 --> 2:52:18.240]  the party of jew haters and israel haters as president trump has said and i remember when
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:23.360]  i counted the policy of the street and the women's march and i chased them down the street and i said
[2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:29.120]  bar a hater and i was sent by the ipd to be arrested and uh people said oh that's going a little
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:34.400]  far don't you think and i said no this guy hates jews and you know i'm sorry but if you're gonna be
[2:52:34.400 --> 2:52:39.040]  locking up jews and arresting them for simply practicing their judyism in new york you hate
[2:52:39.040 --> 2:52:46.480]  jewish people okay build the blasio andrew kwomo they hate jews period let's go further it's
[2:52:46.480 --> 2:52:50.400]  they've been messing with the jews more than anybody it's true they go into baptist churches
[2:52:50.400 --> 2:52:55.760]  they're they're mixed churches and scream their races and have black lives matter attack people
[2:52:55.760 --> 2:52:59.120]  now they're going into synagogues they're not going into liberal synagogues they're going
[2:52:59.120 --> 2:53:04.240]  after hasidics who are they know we're conservative this is this is insane behavior but i guess the
[2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:10.880]  blasio thinks if he can harass jews he can get away with anything right yeah and they're trying to
[2:53:10.880 --> 2:53:15.680]  harm populations that vote conservative okay so they're going after the conservative jews because
[2:53:15.680 --> 2:53:20.640]  they know that a lot of jews are now supporting uh president trump they're going after the older
[2:53:20.640 --> 2:53:26.080]  people that's why kwomo shoved all those infected covid patients into nursing homes is because i
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:31.200]  do believe that he wants elderly people dead i really do think that cops literally trying to
[2:53:31.200 --> 2:53:40.320]  to attack jews i mean this is a fact in attacks on the older older populations which is absolutely
[2:53:40.320 --> 2:53:45.840]  shameful since the beginning of the year it started with getting the youth to have disdain for the
[2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:50.880]  youth through their okay boomer meme okay and that may seem you know for those that don't get it
[2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:55.840]  they're pushing police cars into thousands of jews who refuse to stay locked in their houses
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:54:01.280]  the cops didn't show the black lives matter and do that i know the average new york cops good
[2:54:01.280 --> 2:54:04.960]  on average but who are these cops i notice they're never wearing uniforms they're wearing
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:12.480]  they're wearing like light blue uh uh jumpsuits well i don't know but look alex going back to my
[2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:19.600]  other point um you know politics downstream for culture okay and there has been a lot of uh
[2:54:19.600 --> 2:54:26.640]  you know anti anti senior rhetoric uh that has been perforating through uh over the past uh
[2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:30.240]  several months since the beginning of this year it started with the okay boomer memes
[2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:36.560]  where people were trying to you know incite hatred or disdain for i get it clearly there's
[2:54:36.560 --> 2:54:41.680]  a war on the elders now and the left needs to know they promoted the heirs idea kill the old
[2:54:41.680 --> 2:54:46.480]  well now it's coming back on them yeah and the radical left they're they're they're starting
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:52.640]  to propagate a lot of the same rhetoric okay going to the suburbs and they want to they want to
[2:54:53.200 --> 2:55:01.200]  attack like older rich white people or older people in the suburbs um you know it's it's uh
[2:55:01.200 --> 2:55:06.080]  you know quite brilliant of you to pull up bill airs previous passage because that's exactly
[2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:10.160]  what we're seeing it's all about the revolution right that's what they want they want to start a
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:17.760]  revolution and they realize that in order to uh you know uh succeed in getting their cultural
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:23.600]  marxist uh insurrectionist movement to take over uh the country they need to get rid of the older
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:28.560]  populations that still love america that still there's no doubt laura lumber we love you thank
[2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:34.800]  you for all the time i want to thank trina j alicia and erin will try to get you ahead of
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:40.720]  karyl salante coming up thank you laura lumber for the right back stay with us
[2:55:42.480 --> 2:55:47.760]  there are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the united states much less
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:53.040]  in the entire world info wars to stand alone with our own radio and tv satellite uplinks and
[2:55:53.040 --> 2:55:59.680]  hundreds of stations picking us up almost no one else has that especially anybody covering real issues
[2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:05.520]  of global populism the right to self-defense and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda
[2:56:06.240 --> 2:56:12.160]  that's why when we go out and shoot videos they're at band on video they're not allowed to be on
[2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:18.320]  twitter on youtube on facebook that's why it's so precious because the censorship expands to
[2:56:18.320 --> 2:56:23.600]  everyone which it is now with ai monitoring controlling what you can say and do it's going to
[2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:29.680]  be the oac's black band on video and the now redesign info wars dot com to become more and more important
[2:56:29.680 --> 2:56:35.920]  which they are and the enemy is suing us attacking us hacking us lying about us sabotaging us
[2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.640]  infiltrating us trying to shut us down right now because they're coming after everyone so spread the
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:54.640]  word now big article up on info wars dot com bumbling biden waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[2:56:55.680 --> 2:57:01.360]  bumbling biden again declares he's running for senate those voters to register at non-existent
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:07.600]  website and he's just emblematic of these people gerald salante the top trans forecaster who's got
[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:14.240]  a big as i mentioned earlier columbus day announcement or indigenous people's announcement
[2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:18.320]  coming up here in a few minutes it's about to take over but i wanted to get to trina in
[2:57:18.320 --> 2:57:26.000]  de braska and alicia and a few others trina thanks for holding go ahead hey alex my main thing was
[2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:32.000]  they're now starting to talk about trump's cure for covet wi-38 is in there which is
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:37.760]  aborted fetal fetal cells cloned now they're complaining about it which it's been in our
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:44.240]  pepsi our doritos our vaccines and now the media twists and turns their evilness and
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:48.720]  points to that trump i don't know if this story is true i'm going to have to do more research on
[2:57:48.720 --> 2:57:54.720]  it but where was all the coverage on this back in the day and i am so serious about it there is no
[2:57:55.280 --> 2:58:00.560]  explanation on how furious i am about this why do you cover the sophisticated way to put it
[2:58:00.560 --> 2:58:03.920]  and trump's not perfect i'll criticize him when he deserves it but he's just like hey
[2:58:03.920 --> 2:58:08.320]  get cures get therapeutics turn the economy back on and then you're right now the media is like
[2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:13.120]  oh one of the things he's promoting uses fetal cells okay you're the democrats that love it but
[2:58:13.120 --> 2:58:17.920]  now you're the one saying he's bad i absolutely i think once trump finds out about that he'll back
[2:58:17.920 --> 2:58:22.480]  off that but i think you just i think you just stated exactly where i'm at if trump comes out
[2:58:22.480 --> 2:58:28.000]  for fetal cells and stuff i'll say that's bs i don't like i'll be mad at trump exactly the last
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:34.080]  thing i have to say is if you can get pastor greg lock on he's great he's got a book out called
[2:58:34.080 --> 2:58:41.040]  this means war he's very patriotic um pro trump against leftist and if you can ever get him on
[2:58:41.040 --> 2:58:47.280]  i think sure we'll get him on the gas it's called this means war yeah his book yes it's pastor greg

[2:59:17.520 --> 2:59:24.160]  hearing a lot of fear and um i know there's an answer and god has specifically told me to give
[2:59:24.160 --> 2:59:33.200]  you a call and the answer is in revelation ten verse nine through ten and um to talk about john
[2:59:33.200 --> 2:59:40.000]  digesting a little book it's bitter and sweet well he's giving a take he's giving an easy follows
[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:46.000]  it exactly and he digested it's yeah it's sweet and it's fun and it's bitter in his stomach
[2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:53.040]  while i came across political moron dot com it has a book it's called the little book the witness
[2:59:53.040 --> 2:59:59.840]  and it talks about what's going on now there's a brain award there's a prophetic word going out
[2:59:59.840 --> 3:00:06.160]  and god wants his listeners to hear his voice and a voice of the strangers are not following
[3:00:06.160 --> 3:00:13.360]  jesus christ's name and i pray that you will have an opportunity to get this author on your show
[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:20.640]  because um it's tag king allen from political moron dot com and most importantly it is god's word
[3:00:20.640 --> 3:00:28.000]  and god will not be mocked because when you have the fear of the lord you will obey his voice
[3:00:28.640 --> 3:00:35.760]  and apparently there's a lot of people going just listening to this mad news media that is so
[3:00:35.760 --> 3:00:42.320]  false and when you stand on his word you will not be moved you'll have the i totally agree with you

[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:53.120]  fast go ahead thanks for calling hey alex one thing i want to say is that we have gabin nusum
[3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:57.520]  in california that's telling people that they should take off their mask between bites uh when
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:01:02.480]  they're eating in restaurants and here in kentucky we've got oh they're saying people are dancing back
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:07.920]  to back they're saying we're a mastering sex is all cult leaders seeing what orders will follow
[3:01:08.560 --> 3:01:13.840]  it's a massive cult leader because i hear in kentucky uh andy basher is saying that when you buy
[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:20.800]  things at a store or restaurants they're telling or trying to push uh uh the red the cashier is not
[3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:25.760]  to sell to somebody if they're not wearing a mask exactly and then next they're gonna have to have an
[3:01:25.760 --> 3:01:32.960]  id on their uh phone that lets them this is the total rollout and again people dancing back to
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:38.960]  back it's all satanic everything's upside down not a man and woman face to face now back to back
[3:01:38.960 --> 3:01:45.040]  and everyone's complying like idiots erin absolutely you know i honestly this is satan's
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:49.360]  attack against the family he's trying to destroy the relationships that we have between man and
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:52.880]  woman it's trying to destroy the relationships that we have with father and son and daughter and
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:59.280]  mother etc and seeing this massive assault in this attack makes us realize that the entire rollout
[3:01:59.280 --> 3:02:05.600]  of these masks is just trying to get people to accept the mark of the beast when it comes down the
[3:02:05.600 --> 3:02:11.840]  pike people will gladly accept some kind of a vaccination chip in their body if they need to
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:17.120]  just either stop wearing the mask or go back to regular society i mean even now we're learning that
[3:02:17.840 --> 3:02:22.960]  that microsoft is trying to keep people at home and they're going to tell them if you if you accept
[3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:27.760]  this chip this mark then you can stay at home and then your entire neurobiology is going to be changed
[3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:33.040]  by the way with the face yeah exactly facebook twitter google microsoft they're all coming out

[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:49.440]  that is in the news today i should have had that top story i'm glad you raised that erin
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:56.560]  this is so insane it's so naked it's such a power grab thank you so much jay and utah then
[3:02:56.560 --> 3:03:02.480]  jeryl salante takes over go ahead jay hey alex you're doing a fantastic job appreciates all your
[3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:08.080]  efforts they want to do it parallel with this clown oberman what he said um i've grown up a
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:14.000]  Mormon and i have ancestors that were persecuted of out of new york and went to Ohio were persecuted
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:20.400]  there went to missouri persecuted there the governor of missouri he issued the extermination order
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:24.560]  which made it legal for missourians to kill Mormons and that was on the books until just like a decade
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:29.920]  ago and then the Mormons have to flee the organized united states and flee into mexican
[3:03:29.920 --> 3:03:36.240]  territory and they settle in the territory of utah bar the justice department these guys have
[3:03:36.240 --> 3:03:40.960]  got to draw a line because you can put parallels which instead of Mormons insert trump supporters
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:47.200]  or conservatives or or for jew- whatever and and then that's a great parallel to see what's
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:54.880]  happening if these guys don't get persecuted or prosecuted sorry um and and and and and do their
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:04:01.760]  stewardship protect our rights and um i would love to see john bowne or or greg rief do a report
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:08.640]  on on that parallel or even there was a great old-time 1950s radio show called i was a communist
[3:04:08.640 --> 3:04:14.400]  for the fbi where this guy there's like 70 episodes and they're like a half hour on old-time radio
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:20.080]  and you can see agent provocateur is done and you can see them stage advance and you can see
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:25.280]  gaslighting all these examples it's a fantastic tutorial that could be illustrated and today
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:29.360]  was being promoted in the brother i agree with you and i love you i'm gonna have drill salante

[3:05:36.160 --> 3:05:42.080]  as i wrote in my book what zizi gave honey boy a true story about love wisdom in the soul of america
[3:05:42.080 --> 3:05:49.840]  and here it is since coming to america zizi has seen prosecutors the police the movies and the
[3:05:49.840 --> 3:05:58.880]  media portray italians as mobsters crooks killers and kafones i also wrote if the sopranos brand
[3:05:58.880 --> 3:06:05.360]  of stereotyping is not deemed offensive by political correctness advocates and the show
[3:06:05.360 --> 3:06:12.960]  is awarded trophies by the media for its brilliance then why not bring back amos and andy indeed if
[3:06:12.960 --> 3:06:20.880]  the untouchables the godfathers good fellas are acceptable let's see movies and tv shows of drunk
[3:06:20.880 --> 3:06:30.640]  irish men black welfare queens jewish banksters and latino drug gangs oh would there be outrage

[3:07:47.840 --> 3:07:54.480]  world leader the anti christ and he has a beast system that no one can buy and or sell unless he
[3:07:54.480 --> 3:08:00.560]  has that market in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look back on all the warnings
[3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:06.800]  you were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in god or prophecy giving
[3:08:06.800 --> 3:08:12.000]  governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:18.160]  we do he's not just a recipe it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at bill gates
[3:08:18.160 --> 3:08:23.600]  you look at bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should decide how much salt
[3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:28.880]  you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're technocrats we know best
[3:08:28.880 --> 3:08:32.480]  and we're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:38.080]  you snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying
[3:08:38.080 --> 3:08:57.600]  whether it's insane you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:18:03.600 --> 3:18:07.600]  be able to leave your houses and that this same billionaire would say we're all going to work

[3:30:37.840 --> 3:30:42.720]  you notice that over and over again the united nations are supposed controllers and bosses
[3:30:42.720 --> 3:30:47.520]  the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with has come out and said nothing
[3:30:47.520 --> 3:30:53.840]  can treat or prevent COVID-19 ladies and gentlemen that's a total lie if you get a lot of sunlight
[3:30:53.840 --> 3:30:59.600]  it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin d3 and it's almost impossible to get viral infections
[3:30:59.600 --> 3:31:04.240]  when you're getting plenty of vitamin d3 if you have zinc and vitamin c as well that's why people
[3:31:04.240 --> 3:31:08.960]  get the flus and these colds in the winter because that's when vitamin d levels plunge now i've
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:14.720]  pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope that people
[3:31:14.720 --> 3:31:19.200]  should have their vitamins and their minerals well now fouch he's been forced to come out and admit
[3:31:19.200 --> 3:31:25.040]  that you need vitamin d3 and see he should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you
[3:31:25.040 --> 3:31:30.160]  die without zinc but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many
[3:31:30.160 --> 3:31:34.560]  doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning
[3:31:34.560 --> 3:31:40.960]  the public to get their vitamins this is your last chance to get a packed power stack and i'm really
[3:31:40.960 --> 3:31:46.080]  bummed out about that it started out as a sleeper product but the people that did order it loved it
[3:31:46.080 --> 3:31:50.640]  and started reordering it they spread the word and became one of our best sellers but because
[3:31:50.640 --> 3:31:56.080]  of the covid supply chain breakdown because there's 13 different formulas in a packed power stack

[3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:11.280]  it's amazing i don't have time to go into everything that's in it but this gets people to
[3:32:11.280 --> 3:32:15.440]  remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is

[3:32:52.640 --> 3:32:58.480]  that especially anybody covering real issues of global populism the right to self-defense
[3:32:58.480 --> 3:33:04.800]  and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda that's why when we go out and shoot videos
[3:33:04.800 --> 3:33:11.360]  they're at band.video they're not allowed to be on twitter on youtube on facebook that's why it's
[3:33:11.360 --> 3:33:17.120]  so precious because the censorship expands to everyone which it is now with ai monitoring
[3:33:17.120 --> 3:33:22.400]  controlling what you can say and do it's going to be the lac's black band.video and the now

[3:37:15.120 --> 3:37:27.200]  something about the election coming up the headline in the news has been biden leech trump
[3:37:27.200 --> 3:37:39.680]  by eight point five points if you go back it was two weeks ago i get a more mixed up we have so
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:48.800]  many of them uh transjournal cover it was masks versus no masks that's what this election is going
[3:37:48.800 --> 3:38:00.240]  to be lock it up or lock it down lock it up lock it down i should say open it up lock it down
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:07.760]  open it up lock it down masks on masks off and these aren't more than masks they're muzzles
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:09.600]  you hear people talk
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:22.320]  yeah there it is so now the next one's going to be open it up or lock it down
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:31.520]  that's what's going to determine this election and if trump stays on that message we forecast he
[3:38:31.520 --> 3:38:43.200]  wins that's the only message used to be a saying back in 1992 when that low life piece of slimy
[3:38:43.200 --> 3:38:51.760]  garbage crap murderous thief i smoked but i didn't inhale little willy clinton
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:39:03.520]  in the campaign slogan was it's the economy stupid and that's what it's all about it's
[3:39:03.520 --> 3:39:10.560]  the economy stupid this economy is in the greatest depression we're writing all about it
[3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:15.360]  day after day you're seeing things that never happened before stores is going stores going
[3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:19.280]  bankrupt around the world what's going on in the equity market says nothing to do with reality
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:28.400]  you know all the money what 1% owns over 50% of the equities 10% own 88% of it total disconnect
[3:39:28.960 --> 3:39:34.080]  it's the economy stupid do you think all those bars that have closed down don't want to open
[3:39:34.080 --> 3:39:41.360]  they put their whole lives into running these places all the floor shops the salons all the small
[3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:50.640]  retail stores the mom and pops the his and hers the his and his stores all out of business as
[3:39:50.640 --> 3:39:59.600]  the bigs get bigger it's the economy stupid and that's what trump needs to focus on the economy
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:08.240]  open it up or lock it down i want to put this into context we got that other little slimy piece
[3:40:08.240 --> 3:40:18.480]  of garbage crap over here an arrogant boy born on third base in 38 a home run and equomo who all
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:26.560]  the demo craps brag about oh what a great job he did in new york where they have 33 000 people
[3:40:26.560 --> 3:40:38.720]  dead right 33 500 something i'm mentioning this because spain is also locking down you know any
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:47.600]  people who died in spain not the same amount 33 000 march april may june july august september
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:41:05.280]  uh 33 000 what's the population of spain uh about 46 700 000 33 000 dead population in new york
[3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:17.760]  19 million 33 000 dead you mean 40 almost 47 000 47 million people i get the numbers mixed
[3:41:17.760 --> 3:41:27.040]  up i failed algebra too i went to summer school failed it again you got 47 million people basically
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:38.080]  in spain 33 000 dead 19 and a half million people in new york 33 000 dead and people bow to this
[3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:49.040]  phony little nothing this little dictator you're not allowed to have free speech you're not allowed
[3:41:49.040 --> 3:41:56.960]  to assemble i'll tell you what the constitution is now they're all talking about cases going up
[3:41:59.360 --> 3:42:05.280]  you look at the cases for example in spain oh yeah the cases are going up
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:10.160]  and you look at the chart you show the cases going up
[3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:19.920]  up but then you look at the death rate and it goes like this in the early months
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:30.240]  then like that and then almost the level line oh but cases are going up yeah the cases are going
[3:42:30.240 --> 3:42:40.800]  up but the death rate's going down the death rate is almost flat you keep looking at one piece after
[3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:52.800]  another so why are they doing this it's complete control over the people according to the census
[3:42:52.800 --> 3:42:57.920]  of disease control and prevention and i'm sure this was said on many times on info wars by different
[3:42:57.920 --> 3:43:07.920]  people the recovery rate from people one to 50 years old according to the census of disease
[3:43:07.920 --> 3:43:23.760]  control and prevention is 99.8 percent 99.8 percent you're sick you got the flu you're in bed you
[3:43:23.760 --> 3:43:30.400]  haven't been in bed for two weeks i've been a couple of times in my life yeah how many times
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:38.080]  it's sick and you don't close down the global economy if trump wants to win this election
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:45.440]  it's the economy's stupid hey they opened up there in florida remember they went after that guy
[3:43:45.440 --> 3:43:54.560]  desantis florida has about 22 million people well they have about 15 000 dead half the amount they
[3:43:54.560 --> 3:44:00.880]  have in new york and they went after desantis because he wouldn't lock it down like new york did
[3:44:00.880 --> 3:44:10.080]  and half the death rate again about 22 million people compared to 19.5 million people 15 000 dead
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:21.120]  compared to 33 000 dead it's the economy's stupid if trump wants to win this election
[3:44:21.840 --> 3:44:27.920]  that should be his only message because then he wins the swing states it's the liberals in the
[3:44:27.920 --> 3:44:34.800]  cities that don't like them the people that work for a living in the rural areas they want to be free
[3:44:34.800 --> 3:44:44.480]  and that's all he has to do is bring in those numbers from the swing states michigan ohio
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:45:00.080]  pennsylvania wisconsin and lardin and he wins or else all aboard follow the orders of your leader
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:08.880]  but on that mask do what you're told or be free and the rural people want to be free
[3:45:09.920 --> 3:45:19.120]  and trump could win the election very simply if he plays the one card it's the economy's stupid
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:32.240]  thanks for tuning in support info was in the trends journal see you next week
