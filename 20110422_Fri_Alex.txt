[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.440]  you have found it ladies and gentlemen the front lines in the information war we
[00:31.440 --> 00:38.000]  are attempting to mobilize free humanity worldwide to become conscious of the fact
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.080]  that there is a group of unelected private banking cartels that have taken
[00:43.080 --> 00:48.560]  over every major nation on earth and are attempting to basically set up a police
[00:48.560 --> 00:53.280]  state control grid so that no one can challenge their hegemonic control and
[00:53.280 --> 00:59.680]  domination now the news is all completely and totally off the charts today and
[00:59.680 --> 01:04.440]  we're going to be breaking it all down in great detail we do have a former
[01:04.440 --> 01:09.680]  governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson who announced yesterday that he's running
[01:09.680 --> 01:13.960]  for president as a Republican he's going to be popping in coming up later in the
[01:13.960 --> 01:18.580]  third hour riding shotgun with Bob Chapman in the meantime we're going to be
[01:18.580 --> 01:28.800]  covering all of the vital news and information today now I meant to tell
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.440]  Steve Watson Paul Watson Aaron Dykes or Curtin M.O. my main four in-house
[01:32.440 --> 01:38.040]  writers to do a report on this on Monday then on Tuesday then on Wednesday
[01:38.040 --> 01:42.280]  Thursday and I just didn't get around to telling him to do it because I've been
[01:42.280 --> 01:50.400]  so busy but I did point this out in the last four days on air I know a lot of you
[01:50.400 --> 01:54.840]  will not go check out my claims you will just simply either discounted or
[01:54.840 --> 02:00.640]  believe it and then you shouldn't do that it's major breaking news now because
[02:00.640 --> 02:08.440]  people are paying attention to it and that is the fact that every cell phone
[02:08.440 --> 02:14.840]  sold in the United States and that goes for most cell phones sold worldwide
[02:14.840 --> 02:17.640]  because they're globally standardized the manufacturers don't like to make
[02:17.640 --> 02:24.160]  multiple versions so these systems are being used universally basically under
[02:24.160 --> 02:30.560]  the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that became a law in October 1st 2001 I'm
[02:30.560 --> 02:36.240]  going to go over this in more detail today all cell phones for the last ten
[02:36.240 --> 02:41.440]  years and a lot of Marty had it in before that track where you are where
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.840]  you're going and then when they're smart phones and you plug into your PC or Mac
[02:46.840 --> 02:52.920]  it downloads the info and sends it to Apple Google and others who then sell it
[02:52.920 --> 02:58.040]  to the government now by law they've got to give it to the government oh this is
[02:58.040 --> 03:05.880]  all public by law they've got to give it to the government but also by law they
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.080]  are paid for it because you can't be indentured servitude and here it is
[03:11.080 --> 03:15.120]  again the Wall Street Journal still hasn't scooped this there's there's
[03:15.120 --> 03:19.240]  still time for other alternative blogs out there to scoop them with my research
[03:19.240 --> 03:24.480]  there's still time for my office to do this but here it is Wall Street Journal
[03:24.480 --> 03:30.480]  told you this three days ago told you this yesterday Apple I said Google
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.280]  specifically is the worst so everybody's talking about Apple because
[03:34.280 --> 03:36.600]  researchers found it in Apple and they're and they're wondering you know
[03:36.600 --> 03:42.640]  what it does Apple Google collect user data and these guys will probably win
[03:42.640 --> 03:46.840]  the Pulitzer prize for this oh and I forgot to tell you guys to print it
[03:46.840 --> 03:53.720]  print me Congress launches investigation of cell phones tracking location
[03:53.720 --> 04:00.080]  Congress launches an investigation Congress actually passed this is law in
[04:00.080 --> 04:07.520]  1996 that's like Hitler sitting as the head judge at the Nuremberg trials or
[04:07.520 --> 04:13.720]  that'd be like John Gotti sitting in a mafia corruption racketeering probe as
[04:13.720 --> 04:20.160]  the district attorney and it's like this on every front I mean you think I just
[04:20.160 --> 04:23.880]  get up here and tell you all cell phones by law track everything you do and
[04:23.880 --> 04:29.120]  send the data back to the government location phone list emails where you
[04:29.120 --> 04:37.040]  surfing history everything okay and yes it's all illegal but it's legal oh it
[04:37.040 --> 04:39.960]  violates the Miller Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence every
[04:39.960 --> 04:48.240]  candidate free society but Congress did pass a law but it's a regulation that's
[04:48.240 --> 04:53.200]  the companies have to do this if that doesn't trump the other laws we'll be
[04:53.200 --> 05:04.400]  right back you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.360]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[05:08.360 --> 05:11.800]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[05:11.800 --> 05:16.640]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[05:16.640 --> 05:20.240]  name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[05:20.240 --> 05:24.440]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[05:24.440 --> 05:28.880]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices
[05:28.880 --> 05:34.120]  needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this
[05:34.120 --> 05:40.280]  includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for
[05:40.280 --> 05:44.240]  the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the
[05:44.240 --> 05:50.640]  silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver
[05:50.640 --> 05:55.280]  lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may
[05:55.280 --> 06:01.520]  have that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with five good
[06:01.520 --> 06:05.560]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[06:05.560 --> 06:09.320]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[06:09.320 --> 06:13.680]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[06:13.680 --> 06:18.040]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[06:18.040 --> 06:22.480]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[06:22.480 --> 06:27.240]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:27.240 --> 06:31.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:31.040 --> 06:34.680]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.680 --> 06:39.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.160]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[06:42.160 --> 06:45.840]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[06:45.840 --> 06:50.600]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[08:08.880 --> 08:18.480]  Jones and the GCN radio network I'm not a liberal I'm not a conservative I'm not
[08:18.480 --> 08:27.080]  a libertarian I'm a constitutionalist that believes in right and wrong I believe
[08:27.080 --> 08:30.240]  in the family I believe in the right to self-defense of the Second Amendment I
[08:30.240 --> 08:37.120]  believe and I will defend property rights that's who I am I am known for my
[08:37.120 --> 08:42.920]  deeds and what I report and my accuracy I'm Alex Jones and I appreciate you
[08:42.920 --> 08:48.720]  joining us today we're normally gaining three new affiliates a week in the last
[08:48.720 --> 08:55.400]  year we've gained more than 10 in the last week this radio broadcast is in
[08:55.400 --> 09:01.280]  turbo overdrive and I need to really brace myself and realize that I'm so
[09:01.280 --> 09:06.320]  comfortable doing the show for now more than 16 years that I need to remember
[09:06.320 --> 09:11.080]  sometimes just how many people are listening and and how important this
[09:11.080 --> 09:15.960]  information is because quite frankly I can get up and give a speech to 2,000
[09:15.960 --> 09:22.040]  people live on C-span 2,000 in the crowd live on C-span and not even get
[09:22.040 --> 09:28.280]  butterflies and so I'm trying to force myself to get butterflies because when
[09:28.280 --> 09:31.840]  I do actually have a little bit of anxiety and realize that I'm reaching
[09:31.840 --> 09:37.480]  millions and millions of people right now it will cause me to focus and really
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.680]  cover more news and more information and not be intellectually lazy because I
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.520]  tend to simplify things sometimes I tend to jump from story to story because
[09:46.520 --> 09:52.360]  there is so much news when I could really give people the full gravitas of
[09:52.360 --> 09:57.240]  what we're facing it's still a very informative powerful broadcast I'm just
[09:57.240 --> 10:02.840]  saying I want to kick it up a notch because I do realize that we're getting
[10:02.840 --> 10:06.920]  a lot of huge stations I'm talking number one talk stations and I've got
[10:06.920 --> 10:10.280]  Genesis the network of a Minnesota sending me another big list so I can
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.080]  thank the 20 or so stations that have come on in the last month but 10 or more
[10:15.080 --> 10:19.960]  this week just amazing big stations not just carrying us on the weekends but
[10:19.960 --> 10:24.440]  carrying us weekdays live or rebroadcasting us at night it's just
[10:24.440 --> 10:27.120]  absolutely amazing you know we've got some affiliates that have been
[10:27.120 --> 10:32.080]  carrying us for 14 or more years mom-and-pop small stations medium-sized
[10:32.080 --> 10:36.880]  stations precious stations reaching a lot of people and of course number one
[10:36.880 --> 10:42.480]  on the internet according to shotcasts Alexa and many other metrics when it
[10:42.480 --> 10:45.560]  comes to internet listeners close to half a million a day download the free
[10:45.560 --> 10:49.640]  podcast at info wars.com close to half a million or more depending on the day
[10:49.640 --> 10:56.240]  tune in to the live streams but but you got XM or on global shortwave out of
[10:56.240 --> 11:02.920]  Tennessee WWCR 100,000 watts going out worldwide but it it's just I need to
[11:02.920 --> 11:08.320]  reset here occasionally and really be honest with myself I'm a very private
[11:08.320 --> 11:12.440]  guy I don't like the limelight I don't like to go out and be given awards or
[11:12.440 --> 11:16.360]  be at events I'm a family guy I'd rather just be at home and play with an
[11:16.360 --> 11:20.320]  electric train on the floor with my children or go camping or hunting or
[11:20.320 --> 11:26.280]  fishing but I more and more have to realize the fact that we really are the
[11:26.280 --> 11:31.160]  tip of the spear and having a giant effect against the globalist now I've
[11:31.160 --> 11:37.480]  got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve stacks of
[11:37.480 --> 11:42.200]  news here some days I've only got six or seven some days I've got 20 stacks but
[11:42.200 --> 11:50.360]  I've got 12 stacks here in front of me and each one of these stacks is enough to
[11:50.360 --> 11:54.040]  totally prove how criminal and illegitimate the globalist are and what
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.600]  they're setting up worldwide and the double-speak and the deception and how
[11:58.600 --> 12:02.440]  both political parties in this country and other major nations in the
[12:02.440 --> 12:06.200]  parliamentary system three or four top parties are totally bought and paid for
[12:06.200 --> 12:12.840]  with a globalist anti-freedom anti-liberty anti-family domestication agenda
[12:12.840 --> 12:23.880]  and let me just read to you some of the headlines senator al frank and
[12:23.880 --> 12:29.520]  questions apple over iphone tracking congress opens investigation I told you
[12:29.520 --> 12:36.120]  16 years ago rice 15 years ago 2001 is when it became law but they put the
[12:36.120 --> 12:41.160]  regulations in and had to be in place by October 1st 2001 that all cell phones
[12:41.160 --> 12:45.280]  manufactured and sold in the US and this was adopted in other western nations as
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.520]  well the government can dial in turn them on listen to you even when the phone
[12:50.520 --> 12:56.840]  looks like it's off they can track your location via triangulation and GPS with
[12:56.840 --> 13:01.400]  the cell towers and they can download wirelessly or when you plug into your
[13:01.400 --> 13:08.240]  computer to sync them but this goes for regular cell phones as well all of your
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.560]  data the back doors built in and I told you Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[13:13.560 --> 13:18.880]  that folks it's not just Apple Apple or globalist Al Gore on the board very new
[13:18.880 --> 13:22.760]  world order I happen to like their products hate their leadership so I'm
[13:22.760 --> 13:27.200]  not defending Apple I said look it's all of them well here's the Wall Street
[13:27.200 --> 13:33.520]  Journal with big breaking news today Apple and Google collect user data and
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.640]  you'll see by next week they'll say all major smartphones are tracked and then
[13:38.640 --> 13:43.840]  you'll see footnotes later as the lazy dumb down mainstream kool-aid drinking
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.400]  media finds out it's everything listen senator franken mr. George Soros
[13:49.400 --> 13:56.080]  minion Huffington Post lap dog mr. anti-gun anti-family I know you're
[13:56.080 --> 13:59.440]  dumber in a box of rocks so let me just tell you now maybe people should call
[13:59.440 --> 14:05.960]  senator franken's office and go hey Bob 1996 the house and Senate passed the
[14:05.960 --> 14:12.480]  Telecommunications Act of 1996 and I've been screaming bloody murder I remember
[14:12.480 --> 14:15.800]  in 96 I was covering this the program director called me into his office and
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.440]  this guy two years before had been in a B-suit at a local rock station and was
[14:20.440 --> 14:26.440]  the clown knew nothing knew nothing and and told me I don't believe the
[14:26.440 --> 14:29.520]  government can dial in and listen to cell phones secretly and I don't but I
[14:29.520 --> 14:34.280]  and and you're lying on air and I said okay I'll bring in the Telecommunications
[14:34.280 --> 14:37.160]  Act and when I brought it to him he wouldn't even read it and started
[14:37.160 --> 14:44.200]  threatening me this is what I have to put up with 1996 it was in the trade
[14:44.200 --> 14:49.240]  publications I had telecommunications people calling me telling me about it
[14:49.240 --> 14:54.440]  emailing it to me my listeners told me about it it was real and it wasn't till
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.080]  2005 or so that we'd see newscast big brother eat your heart out shepherd
[14:59.080 --> 15:03.200]  Smith I have a video clip of him saying it actually in police state 3 total
[15:03.200 --> 15:07.760]  enslavement guess what the government's got my law telecommunications act they
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.320]  can dial in and turn your phone on and listen to you big brother no he actually
[15:12.320 --> 15:17.720]  said big brothers here to help civil libertarians eat your heart out that's
[15:17.720 --> 15:25.360]  the exact quote I mean but but I understand why that program director
[15:25.360 --> 15:29.800]  thought I was lying 15 years ago because I was freaking out on air about it it
[15:29.800 --> 15:34.200]  was hard to believe back then that the government by law was having all the
[15:34.200 --> 15:38.360]  cell phone manufacturers put these systems in them and see that's my
[15:38.360 --> 15:45.480]  frustration if I get up here on air and I tell you that in every major city that
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.680]  is putting fluorinated water in their water supply that they're the that the
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.960]  main source of the fluoride is mined out of phosphate mines and they can't use
[15:54.960 --> 15:58.720]  the toxic derivatives of it in the fertilizer it'll kill the plants so they
[15:58.720 --> 16:04.680]  take the hundreds of different chemicals it varies per mine per basically rock
[16:04.680 --> 16:08.320]  quarries what they are you ever seen a concrete factory it's basically the same
[16:08.320 --> 16:12.720]  type of stuff they mine it out of and that's where you've got all the radioactive
[16:12.720 --> 16:16.480]  isotopes that's where you actually generally would mine uranium as well to
[16:16.480 --> 16:20.920]  then purify it and enrich it and that they're putting scores of radioactive
[16:20.920 --> 16:25.120]  isotopes in your drinking water added with the fluoride along with lead our
[16:25.120 --> 16:29.680]  stink mercury and I've been saying this for years having medical doctors and top
[16:29.680 --> 16:35.040]  EPA toxicologist on who themselves are testifying before Congress it's no
[16:35.040 --> 16:38.840]  secret and then it comes out in Texas that for two decades they're covering up
[16:38.840 --> 16:45.720]  the radioactive isotopes in the water that are 10 to 100 times depending on
[16:45.720 --> 16:49.960]  which area they studied safe levels and the news is like oh why is the state
[16:49.960 --> 16:53.200]  covering it up with the feds by the way it's in every other state where they add
[16:53.200 --> 16:58.480]  this stuff but we had whistleblowers in Texas four months ago CBS News AP but
[16:58.480 --> 17:02.680]  only in Texas and then there was no discussion of why is it there how did it
[17:02.680 --> 17:06.360]  get in all the drinking water it was just why did the state cover it up under
[17:06.360 --> 17:10.920]  federal orders and you and if you're a new listener don't believe me you will
[17:10.920 --> 17:17.600]  learn listening to this show if you just take what I say 99% of the time I will
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.760]  state the data in the exact headline or one of the exact headlines that are out
[17:22.760 --> 17:30.800]  there so when I tell you state of Texas covered up radioactive pollution in
[17:30.800 --> 17:35.920]  Texas water you search that you'll get hundreds of articles and then the rabbit
[17:35.920 --> 17:41.720]  hole goes down from there if I tell you that Google six years ago put out a

[27:38.560 --> 27:43.160]  front yard of my kids that part doesn't matter the point is I listen to stuff
[27:43.160 --> 27:49.200]  constantly people say I get emails the reason I describe it I listen to TV over
[27:49.200 --> 27:53.720]  XM I go you're listening to TV in the front yard to liar everybody just I'm
[27:53.720 --> 27:56.840]  so accurate and so devastating the globalist they just try to pick things
[27:56.840 --> 28:03.680]  but side issue and I know you're seeing this too I know if you're monitoring it
[28:03.680 --> 28:08.720]  you're seeing it suddenly what's happened is the nouveau reach the new
[28:08.720 --> 28:12.680]  wealth the millionaires even some of the independent millionaires have
[28:12.680 --> 28:15.280]  figured out that they're not going to have a place at the table at the New
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.400]  World Order this global corporate structure that's being set up where
[28:19.400 --> 28:25.280]  they use government power to shut down all their competition and so the mid
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.760]  level elites are figuring out that they were sold on globalism told it was going
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.080]  to be great and now they're finding out it's a oppressive tyranny where
[28:34.080 --> 28:38.240]  everyone owes everything to the private Federal Reserve and its counterpart the
[28:38.240 --> 28:42.000]  IMF World Bank new global government that's been established and and now
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.600]  the global government's being announced and people understand how corrupted is
[28:45.600 --> 28:50.360]  and that it only serves the tiny elite that are waging war against the new
[28:50.360 --> 28:56.200]  wealth and the middle class and the working class and now I'm not just
[28:56.200 --> 29:00.800]  hearing Glenn Beck and I did listen to part of his TV show last night and I
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.840]  kind of a love hate relationship but it was beautiful what he was saying going
[29:05.840 --> 29:09.800]  over it's a wonderful life and how the banker bankrupts the town and then buys
[29:09.800 --> 29:15.720]  everything for pennies on the dollar and how Bernanke is the bad guy and and how
[29:15.720 --> 29:19.040]  the Federal Reserve wants to collectivize things and bankrupt our economy
[29:19.040 --> 29:24.280]  it's all true it's all an IMF World Bank white papers that got leaked 2002 and
[29:24.280 --> 29:28.520]  then I'm listening to every other conservative station and even liberals
[29:28.520 --> 29:32.800]  and they're all basically saying the same thing now the globalist are in
[29:32.800 --> 29:36.840]  trouble they may have gotten when back fired they may be trying to demonize
[29:36.840 --> 29:41.080]  us in the media the cats out of the bag genies out of the bottle that horse
[29:41.080 --> 29:45.680]  already left the barn the train already left the station I mean there is a huge

[34:25.280 --> 34:27.920]  but I know this is true and they have links to his original articles to prove
[34:27.920 --> 34:32.840]  it goes through the fact that Tucker was able to write an advanced story on the
[34:32.840 --> 34:37.640]  downfall of Margaret Thatcher a year before and later about the rise of Bill
[34:37.640 --> 34:40.800]  Clinton when he attended Bilderberg meeting a year before even ran in
[34:40.800 --> 34:46.400]  Germany as governor of Arkansas he was also able to predict that Bush would
[34:46.400 --> 34:55.400]  would endorse the George W. Bush would endorse global warming before he did
[34:55.400 --> 35:00.080]  everybody laughed at that he was able to say that oil prices would go from $60
[35:00.080 --> 35:04.920]  a gallon to 150 from Bilderberg sources and he's very intelligent but his
[35:04.920 --> 35:09.680]  hearing isn't too good and he was unable to hear us just now we had him on and
[35:09.680 --> 35:13.400]  their audio is low so he just basically disconnected we're getting him on right
[35:13.400 --> 35:20.280]  now okay he is with us now the point is Jim Tucker is amazing and he's got new
[35:20.280 --> 35:25.240]  breaking information at American Free Press net I want drudge to get this
[35:25.240 --> 35:30.480]  because he normally covers the Bilderberg news headline Bilderberg insider
[35:30.480 --> 35:35.560]  Kissinger pushes for US ground invasion of Libya info wars.com prison
[35:35.560 --> 35:40.360]  planet.com and Jim Tucker joins us he also discovered and he's the guy that
[35:40.360 --> 35:43.960]  always does that it's going to be in Switzerland this year he normally finds
[35:43.960 --> 35:47.680]  out a week or two before he found out months before this year he has actual
[35:47.680 --> 35:52.040]  Bilderberg sources I'll just leave it at that this is the group that is the tip
[35:52.040 --> 35:57.640]  top of the New World Order system this is the mafia round table Jim Tucker good
[35:57.640 --> 36:03.120]  to have you here with us well sir you've done it again you don't like to
[36:03.120 --> 36:07.480]  toot your own horn but there are dozens of these on record in print tell us
[36:07.480 --> 36:15.440]  about but it's important to briefly because we have so many new stations
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.720]  Jim we have so many new stations and listeners tell folks in a nutshell what
[36:19.720 --> 36:27.200]  Bilderberg is how you discovered it what they're a gym yes Jim can you hear me
[36:28.880 --> 36:33.720]  hello hello yes yes Jim can you hear me
[36:35.160 --> 36:40.440]  he's having some type of phone issue and this happens occasionally with Jim
[36:40.440 --> 36:50.880]  Jim can you hear me okay again folks this is huge breaking news and we're
[36:50.880 --> 36:55.280]  having some issues well I've called into my own show before when I'm on the road
[36:55.280 --> 37:00.320]  and I have a fill-in guest and there's good audio and we got him on short notice
[37:00.320 --> 37:11.480]  today okay we're gonna go back to Jim here in a moment this is breaking inside
[37:11.480 --> 37:18.280]  information okay Jim can you hear me now yes break down what Bilderberg group is
[37:18.280 --> 37:22.960]  and this latest bombshell info you've got dealing with Kissinger pushing for
[37:22.960 --> 37:30.360]  the ground invasion yes the part of newcomers will explain that Bilderberg is
[37:30.360 --> 37:35.840]  a group of approximately 120 international financiers political leaders
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.720]  heads of state from Europe high officials for US government the president
[37:40.720 --> 37:44.920]  United States unlike other heads of state cannot attend by the office because
[37:44.920 --> 37:50.760]  the White House reporters count for every minute of his day even on vacation
[37:50.760 --> 37:55.800]  how good is he basically and when not in all that jazz but the Secretary of
[37:55.800 --> 38:05.840]  State attends Secretary Commerce Secretary of Treasury and other leaders
[38:05.840 --> 38:12.480]  high officials of the administration of all attend and get their marching
[38:12.480 --> 38:20.840]  orders from these 120 international financiers and political leaders
[38:20.840 --> 38:25.160]  allowing to look at that by going on the Americans by looking back by going
[38:25.160 --> 38:31.680]  behind closed doors to secretly plan US policy and their plans for us are not
[38:31.680 --> 38:39.320]  very good the bad news is they want to get the United States involved in
[38:39.320 --> 38:44.480]  land war in Libya so it can inflame the entire Middle East so they can
[38:44.480 --> 38:53.080]  rationalize invading Iran on Israel's behalf of the theory that Iran has
[38:53.080 --> 39:00.560]  nuclear weapons and Iran belongs to this international group of proposed
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.480]  nuclear repose liberation Iran allows inspectors international inspectors
[39:05.480 --> 39:11.280]  to come in and examine it site how Israel's had nuclear weapons since at
[39:11.280 --> 39:18.920]  least 1962 they do not belong to the group and refuses inspections so that's
[39:18.920 --> 39:25.480]  sums up the war end of it and there's still some more bad news they are eager
[39:25.480 --> 39:30.920]  the trilateral's their junior partners and build a very eager for America's
[39:30.920 --> 39:38.560]  defense base $7 $7 a gallon our gasoline and of course they're still
[39:38.560 --> 39:46.600]  pushing hard for the World Treasury Department on the theory that they can
[39:46.600 --> 39:50.840]  prolong the American recession it's still a recession despite the lives by
[39:50.840 --> 39:58.640]  the administration they get over to the year all through the year 2012
[39:58.640 --> 40:03.760]  Americans become so hungry and desperate they would embrace a world
[40:03.760 --> 40:09.160]  department of Treasury well that's their goals now the good news is they're
[40:09.160 --> 40:15.160]  failing on all fronts American patriots and they become more aware throughout
[40:15.160 --> 40:20.320]  this such as America's repress and you and the independent newspapers not the
[40:20.320 --> 40:24.560]  Washington Post York Times no eight times there they represented at these
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.960]  meetings that make their solemn promise to report nothing to not use word
[40:29.960 --> 40:35.440]  bill a bird to advocate the bill a bird program but without identifying bill a
[40:35.440 --> 40:44.200]  bird is their dictator which makes them journalistic whores obviously so the
[40:44.200 --> 40:49.400]  good news and you see Alex when you've been to these meetings in Chantilly and
[40:49.400 --> 40:56.200]  in Canada where the independent daily newspapers independent broadcast
[40:56.200 --> 41:01.480]  out but such as yours they'll give it heavy attention we've seen a lot of
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.680]  reporters and a lot of broadcasters and independent operation cover these
[41:06.680 --> 41:12.440]  leaves cover them very thoroughly we see that in Canada we see it in the United
[41:12.440 --> 41:18.960]  States and we see it for much longer in Europe where the major newspapers give
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.320]  heavy attention page one attention photos stories raised the proper
[41:23.320 --> 41:29.200]  questions of how are they meeting in secret what is what are they trying to
[41:29.200 --> 41:36.360]  hide from the world so they've been slow down badly they were expected by the
[41:36.360 --> 41:42.360]  year 2000 back in the 90s they were confident and about 2000 the United
[41:42.360 --> 41:46.160]  States would surrender its sovereignty along with the other nations in the
[41:46.160 --> 41:52.960]  western hemisphere to the American Union it would be using not the dollar but the
[41:52.960 --> 41:59.280]  American oh well they're not even close to that now and it was at least 15 years
[41:59.280 --> 42:03.440]  ago when they were so confidently predicting that would happen by the
[42:03.440 --> 42:09.440]  year 2011 years ago okay I'm around down now so you fire some questions with me
[42:09.440 --> 42:16.640]  okay Jim you can hear me correct yes okay good now again briefly so people know
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.480]  how serious this is and your back issues are going back 36 37 years are all over
[42:21.480 --> 42:26.720]  the web I want you to go back briefly and it isn't you predicting stuff you
[42:26.720 --> 42:31.320]  have real sources this group are some of the biggest decision-makers globalist
[42:31.320 --> 42:36.760]  one-worlders decades ago they said this didn't exist and you were a crazy person
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.840]  now they have to cover it now the news blockade has been partially broken by
[42:41.840 --> 42:48.000]  drudge report and others that pick up our reports via your reporting briefly
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.840]  tell folks about some of the incredible news you've broken months or years before
[42:52.840 --> 42:57.600]  it even happened so they understand the magnitude of what you said saying that
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.560]  the globalists have decided to go to seven dollars a gallon for gas to rape
[43:02.560 --> 43:07.520]  us and and and more specifics on that but first you know the proofs in the
[43:07.520 --> 43:11.560]  pudding that that you've researched what they do you have sources inside and
[43:11.560 --> 43:15.640]  they are calling the shots evidenced by you months or years before it happens
[43:15.640 --> 43:21.920]  being able to tell people what's going to unfold yes I don't make predictions I
[43:21.920 --> 43:29.320]  do report what billberg is advocating in history does confirm my reporting some
[43:29.320 --> 43:34.420]  of the bigger ones I think would go back to Bill Clinton's years in the fight
[43:34.420 --> 43:41.600]  house and when we reported that billberg or the United States to go to war
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.240]  somewhere and go over their Vietnam syndrome billberg love Vietnam because
[43:46.240 --> 43:55.560]  these of course war profiteering is big bucks to these the guys like rock
[43:55.560 --> 44:09.800]  dollar to sons of the industrial age so we reported that billberg wanted Bill
[44:09.800 --> 44:15.720]  Clinton to go to war get over the one the time when she bagged I don't have
[44:15.720 --> 44:20.520]  exactly it's kind of me know the Balkans you called that you called a year
[44:20.520 --> 44:24.120]  before even ran that he would run and got laughed at you called a close to a
[44:24.120 --> 44:28.680]  year before that the Berlin Wall would fall in a staged event you reported
[44:28.680 --> 44:33.080]  Bush would endorse global warming you reported when gas was 45 to $60
[44:33.080 --> 44:37.960]  varying that it would go to 150 then you said it would go down because they
[44:37.960 --> 44:41.520]  decided to stop the squeezing because folks weren't buying as much as they
[44:41.520 --> 44:45.600]  thought you reported I mean you've reported everything because of your
[44:45.600 --> 44:50.600]  sources inside you also said that Obama was at the secret meeting in Chantilly
[44:50.600 --> 44:54.920]  and that within a few days that he would Hillary would announce Secretary of
[44:54.920 --> 44:58.400]  State we were both at that meeting covering it the rest the media didn't
[44:58.400 --> 45:02.360]  know where Hillary and Obama had gone we did then that was confirmed I mean
[45:02.360 --> 45:06.000]  just everything Jim these guys are running the world you have the sources
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.080]  inside and we're now getting some similar sources but not as not as high
[45:10.080 --> 45:16.800]  level we've got some of their minions this is huge yes a little fun
[45:16.800 --> 45:22.800]  white house about that meeting the meeting that Hillary attended and George
[45:22.800 --> 45:32.040]  I think it was we used to there we'd seen her there he spent girls carrying
[45:32.040 --> 45:36.280]  drinks around school pool we're excited about seeing Hillary Clinton I'll get
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.960]  back to Washington and called the White House official confirmation and the
[45:40.960 --> 45:47.200]  White House the office first secretary for the first lady they have two different things
[45:47.200 --> 45:54.200]  the first lady says no see what I said I said okay I know she was there I'll do
[45:54.200 --> 46:01.600]  is unless you want to change your view is to report that the first lady didn't
[46:01.600 --> 46:07.280]  attend the Bilderberg meeting but her staff was unaware that she was a president
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.760]  of the meeting and then they're not good some screeches I say you have 25 minutes
[46:11.760 --> 46:16.160]  call me back and confirm it I'll report that she was there and you didn't say
[46:16.160 --> 46:20.400]  that you didn't you said that you did not know they called back said yes she was
[46:20.400 --> 46:24.840]  there there's a lot of fun keys these good and you got her hit for the Logan act
[46:24.840 --> 46:32.480]  for that didn't you oh yeah well the taxpayers paid the $300,000 fine
[46:32.480 --> 46:40.360]  yes Mr. Judge imposed on the White House for violating the Logan act so they
[46:40.360 --> 46:47.840]  they were fined $300,000 which the taxpayers paid I see you the reason
[46:47.840 --> 46:53.360]  taxes are raised I didn't want her publicly nailed and that was fun and
[46:53.360 --> 47:04.000]  then her roommate Bill Clinton he was bloody handed draft Dodger to ever
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.920]  disgrace the White House with his presence or the attack on Kosovo it was
[47:08.920 --> 47:13.640]  for the fun of it well Bilderberg orders
[47:14.840 --> 47:21.440]  before he we had no it was a short war we had no casualties Americans love
[47:21.440 --> 47:26.720]  wars when we don't have anybody hurt but think about the really thousands of
[47:26.720 --> 47:33.840]  people whose old men women children who died on the ground to cause our planes
[47:33.840 --> 47:40.920]  flew so high if they have range of the artillery on the ground the Kosovo that
[47:40.920 --> 47:45.360]  they could not bomb accurately they just had to drop the bombs blindly so that's
[47:45.360 --> 47:52.040]  why school bus full of school children are all killed when a business gets hit
[47:52.040 --> 47:56.520]  the hardest hamburger joint was hit at all kinds of innocent targets were hit
[47:56.520 --> 48:01.800]  and then some people died because Bilderberg ordered couldn't do that to
[48:01.800 --> 48:05.240]  get us out of what they call Vietnam's syndrome where Americans did not want to
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.840]  get a war anymore because the bad experience in Vietnam which was very
[48:09.840 --> 48:13.480]  highly possible right Jim Jim I'm sorry to interrupt you could tell these
[48:13.480 --> 48:17.960]  incredible stories for hours that are all on record you dropped a bigger bombshell
[48:17.960 --> 48:21.720]  and by the way drudge is just thank you Matt Matt obviously listening there's
[48:21.720 --> 48:25.960]  just red-linked Bilderberg insider Kissinger calls for US invasion of
[48:25.960 --> 48:28.960]  Libya get Watson on the phone with all these new developments we need to beef
[48:28.960 --> 48:33.360]  this article now with the new information Jim Tucker the world is listening
[48:33.360 --> 48:37.960]  again you've called it repeatedly you're saying Bilderberg is giving the orders to
[48:37.960 --> 48:46.600]  run oil up to what sir and what's the time frame by the end of the year 2012
[48:46.600 --> 48:52.360]  they want to be paying seven dollars gallons of gasoline they point out that
[48:52.360 --> 48:59.520]  the beach are now paying the equivalent of eight American dollars gallon and what
[48:59.520 --> 49:05.560]  they want to do is to bring the American standard of living down this can be
[49:05.560 --> 49:11.560]  better living of the so-called third world are poor countries they call
[49:11.560 --> 49:16.840]  developing nations that they that's even of them for poor countries so they won't
[49:16.840 --> 49:22.840]  the whole world to have the same standard living which is lower than the
[49:22.840 --> 49:28.600]  American standard of living part of the world government movement if everybody
[49:28.600 --> 49:32.840]  on earth has the same standard living especially lower than the American
[49:32.840 --> 49:38.480]  standard of living part of our system is so much better than dictators
[49:38.480 --> 49:43.040]  sure they're on record they call it a post-industrial world Maury strong the
[49:43.040 --> 49:47.040]  head of the Goddard Space Center Al Gore they're all gonna have palaces but
[49:47.040 --> 49:51.080]  they're gonna take our wealth you know in the name of helping the poor but
[49:51.080 --> 49:53.920]  really it came out at the Copenhagen summit they were actually gonna cut
[49:53.920 --> 50:02.240]  carbon on the poor even more yes most definitely well that's why these meetings
[50:02.240 --> 50:07.480]  always follow the Copenhagen thing that's a big meeting and they do meet
[50:07.480 --> 50:12.280]  behind closed doors but they do have 3,000 reporters involved cashers
[50:12.280 --> 50:17.520]  attending and they do hold press conferences you can ask questions you
[50:17.520 --> 50:24.120]  can ask hospital questions so as long as that's why Billy Bird is more interesting
[50:24.120 --> 50:32.640]  than the these guys called Billy Bird try to deny their existence Jim if you
[50:32.640 --> 50:38.640]  can do five more minutes with us into the next hour or five minutes in the

[53:01.280 --> 53:05.200]  did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret
[53:05.200 --> 53:08.600]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[53:08.600 --> 53:12.440]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[53:12.440 --> 53:15.560]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[53:15.560 --> 53:19.520]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[53:19.520 --> 53:23.600]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[53:23.600 --> 53:28.520]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[53:28.520 --> 53:32.040]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[53:32.040 --> 53:35.880]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[53:35.880 --> 53:41.080]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's
[53:41.080 --> 53:51.280]  survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[53:51.280 --> 53:56.920]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[53:56.920 --> 54:01.120]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:08.280 --> 54:13.200]  all right he's with us five minutes in the next hour he is a living legend I
[54:13.200 --> 54:17.320]  mean it doesn't get any more he wears the straw hat and the suit folks I mean
[54:17.320 --> 54:20.920]  he's but he doesn't do it because he's copying the archetypal image of a
[54:20.920 --> 54:26.720]  reporter he is the real deal and he's giving a super inside intel Jim Tucker
[54:26.720 --> 54:31.240]  other key intel from your sources reading here it sounds like the speech
[54:31.240 --> 54:36.000]  Brzezinski gave last year to the CFR that was televised on C-span when he
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.160]  said the elite are in trouble the world is waking up everybody's talking about
[54:40.160 --> 54:46.280]  the New World Order the private fellow reserve more intel other tidbits that
[54:46.280 --> 54:54.160]  you can give us Jim again Jim's having trouble hearing us Jim more
[54:54.160 --> 55:02.960]  tidbits Jim we're live every time he's at his farm in Virginia this happens I
[55:02.960 --> 55:06.960]  guess bad phone lines when he's at the newspaper AFP there's never this problem
[55:06.960 --> 55:15.520]  but we got him on short notice today it goes in and out and Jim is a character
[55:15.520 --> 55:20.720]  to say the least he's been shot at in Portugal arrested many times you know
[55:20.720 --> 55:24.640]  70 something years old years ago when he'd be climbing over fences and through
[55:24.640 --> 55:30.080]  drainage ditches and dressing up like like waitstaff to infiltrate elite
[55:30.080 --> 55:36.040]  confabs Jim can you hear me all right well it doesn't matter we got the huge
[55:36.040 --> 55:39.080]  breaking information and I should have known when I heard he was at his farm
[55:39.080 --> 55:43.680]  look out that this happens every time he's at his farm I'm tempted to buy a
[55:43.680 --> 55:47.880]  cell phone because they're only like you can get one for like 30 bucks a month and
[55:47.880 --> 55:52.240]  mail it to Jim because I'd have Jim on every week if we didn't have this issue
[55:52.240 --> 55:57.840]  when he's not in DC I didn't matter as soon as he gets back to DC where they
[55:57.840 --> 56:05.840]  got some good phones will he can hear us when he's on the phone Jim you're live
[56:05.840 --> 56:09.960]  tell us any other information that you got from your Bilderberg source you were
[56:09.960 --> 56:18.480]  telling us that that Kissinger's depressed the last two or three meetings
[56:18.480 --> 56:25.280]  which is good news for us that more he's and David Rockefeller the other kids
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.720]  would be pressed the happier we are because that means there they realize
[56:31.720 --> 56:39.280]  they're failing in fact over two or three years ago prior to their meetings we were
[56:39.280 --> 56:42.800]  able to close the dust over here but they started wandering around the palace
[56:42.800 --> 56:51.800]  yards too much so that we could speak up and sit under a wall in east stop and
[56:51.800 --> 56:57.520]  they were one of the cities almost not worth while first have these meetings
[56:57.520 --> 57:03.520]  anymore since they were making so difficult and they were really down
[57:03.520 --> 57:08.720]  beaten down be there since because as I mentioned earlier we are winning and
[57:08.720 --> 57:12.960]  they are losing the paychecks of America and from other countries in Europe and
[57:12.960 --> 57:18.680]  Canada are winning and they are losing their far behind in their world
[57:18.680 --> 57:24.280]  government ambitions any other tidbits any other intel out of these three
[57:24.280 --> 57:30.400]  speeches that your Bilderberg source a witness to Kissinger give
[57:30.400 --> 57:33.760]  let's see if I can
[57:33.760 --> 57:40.880]  turn me back I'm just getting even as we speak
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.600]  yeah what else you got there in the notes Jim give it all to us
[57:47.600 --> 57:52.360]  we speak well we're going to break for one minute so you'll be able to finish
[57:52.360 --> 57:56.520]  up but but go ahead and get started as soon as you find it all right
[57:56.520 --> 58:07.240]  I was looking for the names of some of these people now was one of them the and
[58:07.240 --> 58:15.920]  also the Azulik as in former now present world back and former big big
[58:15.920 --> 58:22.560]  ambassador to the president economic affairs they were both in this
[58:22.560 --> 58:28.200]  conversation about how bad things are how depressed they are
[58:28.200 --> 58:37.560]  how these oh they're especially upset that Americans are aware of the fact
[58:37.560 --> 58:47.520]  back in one minute stay there this is GCN the Genesis communications radio
[58:47.520 --> 58:53.520]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.520 --> 58:57.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:57.840 --> 59:02.040]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:02.040 --> 59:06.080]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:06.080 --> 59:09.960]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:09.960 --> 59:14.240]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.240 --> 59:18.400]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.400 --> 59:22.720]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:22.720 --> 59:26.440]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.440 --> 59:30.640]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.640 --> 59:34.000]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.960]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[59:37.960 --> 59:43.240]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[59:43.240 --> 59:51.640]  doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:51.640 --> 01:00:05.960]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:13.280]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:21.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.160]  well Jim Tucker I could talk to him all day but he's leaving in five minutes
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.680]  and then we'll continue with all the news and other very informative guest
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.240]  presidential candidate Gary Johnson joining us okay you were going over
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.040]  Zellacow World Bank head and others in these meetings with Kissinger these
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.880]  closed-door globalist pre-Bilderberg steering committee meetings and the
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.720]  fact that they're very upset and there was some key info that they're upset
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.640]  with dealing with the American people Jim Tucker yes a conversation overheard
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.160]  between Zellac Kissinger and Rockefeller in his wheelchair although we
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:01:00.480]  can hear Rockefeller say anything gives us Rockefeller's valet issue no be
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:08.120]  known the fact that Americans had become aware that if the so-called rebels in
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.280]  Libya should win or partially win just gonna end up with a piece of the
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:21.360]  territory the Taliban Al-Qaeda kids will be in great great shape because they're
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.280]  part of the rebellion the Taliban now kind of our part a significant part of
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:34.560]  the rebel forces in Libya so if the rebels they'll even partially holding
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:40.080]  just part of the country the Taliban will be in position to attack Washington
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.240]  on the level of 9-11 and they're very upset that Americans became aware of
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.080]  that and they grouse about the explicit newspapers and
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:02:01.000]  broadcasters that expose that information and force it into the well
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.880]  they called it well the National Press referred to broadcasters TV outlets why
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.760]  because they're running and supporting Al-Qaeda and using the terror to take
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:16.560]  our liberty specifically why are they upset about that well I don't think we
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:23.600]  as bad as there are the billboard kids really intended to help Al-Qaeda but they
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:30.400]  didn't tend to have a manufacturer a big boy in Libya so that they could inflame
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.720]  the entire Middle East as I mentioned earlier and a rash life yes attack on
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:42.440]  Iran I think that they were just in their interest was simply unaware that the
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:51.320]  Taliban was a significant part of the rebel movement but nevertheless if they
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:58.160]  succeed if the rebels succeeded a degree the Taliban will be as strong as it was
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:06.200]  but it is capable of killing 3,000 Americans it was 9-11 so they're upset
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.920]  the American people know that they're basically giving Al-Qaeda Taliban a new
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.400]  base of operations and they know that this is going to backfire on them and
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:20.160]  is backfiring yes and they're outraged that it was these newspapers and
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:26.360]  broadcasters did it and forced into what they call the National Press although
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.120]  the Washington Post was of course in New York Times early times all of which
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:37.440]  are represented at Bilderberg on their promises of secrecy felt forced to
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:43.200]  acknowledge the Taliban role it was on the jump page deep inside the story but
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.320]  it was normally been the chief with page one lead Jim we've only got one minute
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.680]  left quick any other bombshells that you've got this is incredible well I

[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:26.000]  millions of dollars are spent to buy toxic fluoride that's a toxic byproduct

[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:45.000]  put on watch list just absolutely incredible that that's going on 9-1
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.080]  responders to be warned they will be screened by FBI terrorism watch list
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.200]  because they can't be trusted well we got the internal documents two years ago
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.680]  none of it has to do with Taliban al-Qaeda they're completely protected
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.240]  green-lighted underwear bomber helped on the plane by the State Department
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.240]  Detroit Free Press AP we told you a month before with the lawyer he was on
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.760]  board and witnessed it all happen the guy didn't even have a passport and the
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:14.000]  embassy gave him a visa and then men in suits a guy in a suit helped get him on
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.760]  the plane and was so powerful the airport was saying no you got to have
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:24.680]  ID and the guy showed them circuit some credentials and got him on one is
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.240]  they're using these terrorists to menace us and meanwhile it's all pointed at the
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.560]  cops the military because you used to have guns you can't be trusted they know
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.160]  that the firemen and police I've been in New York many times are waking up to
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.800]  building seven being blown up it's all targeting you that's what's so sick about
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:49.200]  this you better grow up some of you out there you know cops that pull over people
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:55.680]  the Ron Paul stickers the Bob Barr stickers you know these are the Mike
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:01.720]  reports first came out Missouri now we learn it's nationwide all right I'm I'm
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.640]  now ranting the point is that's all coming up right now the drudge report in
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:15.440]  the last four or five years has led the way every year breaking the blockade I've
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:22.240]  been reporting on Bilderberg grip for 16 plus years Jim Tucker for 36 37 since
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:30.200]  since 1975 do the math I guess 37 years and until about a decade ago the media
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.200]  made fun of him and said it didn't exist now they just make fun and say oh global
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:38.280]  elites hundreds of a meeting in secret royalty Rothschilds Rockefellers
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:44.720]  presidents governors who always turn out to then be presidents Rick Perry went a
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.880]  few years ago got to watch him they just make fun of you but now because of the
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.680]  drudge report and you got to give them the credit taking our reports and other
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.280]  foreign reports and in breaking the news blockade in the US they've gone for
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.640]  making fun of Bilderberg group and saying it doesn't exist to now mainstream
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.760]  news and mainline conservative talk show hosts saying yeah the Bilderberg
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.520]  group wants one world government and then their public meeting Davos they
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.720]  called for a hundred trillion more three months ago in an additional taxpayer
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.920]  money put up telegraph or AP headline Davos calls for 100 trillion in
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:25.000]  additional funds that they can leverage to infinity through fractional reserve
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.880]  banking the point is they can't play games anymore they can't deny this stuff
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:34.400]  exists anymore they tried ridicule they tried laughing at us they tried
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.400]  ignoring us it's over the dams broken the genies out of the bottle the cow left
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:46.200]  the barn you know the chickens flew the coop the train left the station and I'm
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.200]  going to pull Watson here in just a moment to give him some marching orders
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:56.560]  one of my best researchers and writers out there but after he leaves this I
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.520]  just want to break down how positive things are yes it was the best of
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:07.440]  times the worst of times what a tale of two cities it's only when things start
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.720]  getting bad that people get off the bench and get in the game and the question
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.880]  is will you get off the bench and wake up and break your conditioning and the
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.800]  trencher under before we let the globalist carry us to the end of the
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.960]  road and let me tell you it isn't pretty so I want to give you the positive
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.920]  news and the negative news then news blitz take a few calls ahead of the
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:34.360]  governor and others joining us but I want to bring Watson up Watson good job
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:40.240]  on covering the Jim Tucker information it is red linked up near the top of Drudge
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.760]  report which again that's like winning a major touchdown in the info war you
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.600]  know instead of getting a half million visitors the info wars calm and you know
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.320]  350,000 the prison planet today we'll get conservatively some one time it was
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.960]  three million individual users it's usually about a million we'll get a
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:05.360]  million people a million people reading that today and then it gets even
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.520]  better every blog under the sun will then copy our article because I could
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.720]  care less about getting the traffic I want them seeing that info I want my
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.160]  children to grow up free I want to defeat these criminal globalist I got a
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.920]  beef with them I'm obsessed with defeating them I don't like bully squatting
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.920]  on me and dominating me never had a bully sit on your chest and spit in your
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.960]  face and sit there and just hit you in the face while his friends laugh that
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.680]  happened to me a lot folks and you know what I'm glad it happened it made me who
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.560]  I am I talk a lot about it 10 11 12 13 years old getting the snot beat out of
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.760]  me every week every month if I was lucky until I finally found when I was about
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.520]  12 and a half 13 doesn't matter if this kid's four years older than me and weighs
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.200]  100 pounds more and I'm little and skinny and he's sitting on my chest spitting in
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.000]  my face if I just get angry he can't stop me I'm gonna throw him off and then
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.720]  I'm gonna sit there and I'm gonna break his nose and knock his teeth out and you
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.520]  know what the punk deserves it but you know what you can't beat somebody's
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.520]  butt unless you're in the right that's what the founder of the Texas Rangers
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.480]  said a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right if the man in
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.240]  the right keeps on a common and you know what you may bring me down New World
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:20.920]  Order you may kill me deader than a hammer but it was Lord Nelson that said damn
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.320]  the maneuvers go straight at him and then it was a US Admiral who said damn the
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.760]  torpedoes just go straight at him and that's what I'm saying I'm coming
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:33.280]  straight on for the New World Order I can smell blood I can smell fear I can
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:40.440]  smell defeat I am a human torpedo a salvo a torpedo of truth and if you're
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.320]  gonna call me and say I'm copying Charlie Sheen it's the other way around I
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.080]  love it that he picks up my little terms the point is we are torpedoes of
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:53.240]  truth we are salvos violent torpedoes of truth for liberty and we are coming on
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.800]  we are committed to the fight like we're on the cavalry pouring in against the
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.960]  enemy and I got my saber and they got theirs and we're just gonna have a
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:06.040]  hack and slash and that's just the end of it and nothing on there is gonna stop
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:10.960]  us in the info war so the globals want to stage terror attacks and demonize
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.720]  liberty movements they can have a war with us but we're reaching out to the
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.920]  military and the police just commit nothing's gonna stop you there's no
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:23.320]  standing down now we're going in we're going in hot and let me tell you we're
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.000]  getting some serious damage on the New World Order we're blowing the daylights
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.120]  out of them and they're scared the White House is scared Cass Sunstein scared I
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.080]  know Jim Tucker's a hundred percent iron-side source the proofs in the
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.600]  pudding but I don't even need that I got Brzezinski in public I got the globalist
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.760]  documents Watson obviously you need to say update on the drudge link and then
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.640]  at the bottom as they go to the bottom for the update on the globalist wanting
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.840]  to raise by the end of next year that's confirming what the oil company execs
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.400]  told Williams yeah that they're gonna try to go to seven dollars a gallon to
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.520]  bankrupt us with the with the deindustrialization of the economy the
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.720]  post-industrial system the fact that they're hopping madness in the LA times
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.840]  New York Times everywhere because the alternative media reported months ago
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.360]  they've been forced to report Taliban al-Qaeda is the core group leading the
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.880]  rebels I mean did you Paul you said you were listening did you a great writer
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.920]  over at prison planet calm the editor did you hear that bombshell info with
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:28.440]  Jim Tucker yes Alex the al-Qaeda stuff is in the article two paragraphs before
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:35.680]  the end so that's already in there what about the bombshell oil and from no I
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:43.280]  didn't include any that yeah that that's the big because you remember 2008 no
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.000]  that was 2006 he said they they're gonna pop the housing bubble an excellent
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.680]  sources confirmed that when he did you know maybe had some of his predictions
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:53.960]  there so folks know how serious this is and then even Wikipedia has links to the
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.560]  old articles he wrote to prove it you know you he called in 2006 they pop the
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:08.520]  housing bubble by 2008 in 2007 from his sources he said now they're going to run
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.040]  up the gas prices in 2008 even wrote articles at the time 2008 I was at
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.800]  Boulderburg covering it and in it went up to 149 then he said they were gonna
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.840]  drop it before they did it did drop and so basically it's the same Intel we're
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.840]  getting from Williams as he has former head of one of the big three old
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.280]  company execs telling the same thing it's an agenda we need to get that in
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.560]  there or maybe it's own article but then a link with an update at the top because
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:37.200]  I know you're doing one on Columbine and this latest copycat there in
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.600]  Littleton with the propane bomb but I mean obviously that's bombshell Watson
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:48.760]  correct yeah well the bombshell thing about it is the fact that Kissinger
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:55.640]  wants it to go on through 2012 meaning to the at least another year given the
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.760]  fact that it's already cost American taxpayers at least and this is just up
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:09.400]  to April 4th so we're talking two weeks ago $608 million to this intervention in
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:14.800]  a civil war in North Africa when in places like New York they're shutting
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:21.000]  down 20 fire stations laying off police and basically loss ball in entire
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.760]  communities I mean imagine if some people are talking about 20 or 30 years
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.840]  this is billions and billions of dollars that are gonna be spent on this
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:36.440]  supporting Al Qaeda and the rebels and it's only gonna further bankrupt the US
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:42.240]  as it loses its triple 8 credit rating and the dollar for me well Watson you
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.720]  want to hold over for five more you want to get to the article
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.520]  I'll beat the article up now all right well done they're right back with key

[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:17.840]  all right I've already covered some of the positive news but when you read what
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.560]  Cass Sunstein the regulations are has written publicly he says the alternative
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:28.360]  media is killing us we've got to set up a taxation system first a government
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:33.600]  takeover of the web where we place announcements over people's websites
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.600]  saying things aren't true and then directing them to government or trusted
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:43.120]  sources we need to reach out more to the mainstream media the dinosaur media to
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.720]  demonize alternative views and then we need to prepare the public for the
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.760]  arrest of people that engage in conspiracy theories and he gave a list he
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.880]  said and you can pull this up I mean this has been even in brooders and they
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.800]  report it with straight face a New York magazine last month wrote an article
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:03.400]  kind of agreeing with Cass Sunstein and saying Alex Jones might be a dangerous
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.680]  guy you know Alex Jones is doing some really bad stuff his Cass Sunstein
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.360]  writes saying shut Alex down you know I mean I mean they're really doing this
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:18.680]  and the internet new ID Chinese style ID Obama announced last Friday seven days
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.400]  ago the new announcement that all over the country the cops are grabbing your
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.040]  cell phone data illegally and hacking your phones as they have backdoors built
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:32.200]  in them and grabbing all the data off of it the smart phones not just Apple
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:36.720]  telling you all week smart phones are all jacked in telecommunications act of
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:43.320]  96 and Franken the moron senator he is a moron anti-liberty anti-gun anti-family
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.120]  is saying he wants to have an investigation well investigate your
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:52.160]  own Senate in the house then bubba we need to find out who committed this
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.720]  crime oh we did I'm gonna excuse me well then I guess it's okay this is all
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:04.400]  systematic this is all systematic but the good news is they're panicking for
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.360]  Cass Sunstein to come out and say that and do that and say nobody trust the
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.160]  mainstream media we've also got to pose as conspiracy theorist alternative
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.320]  media is what that is a buzzword for and anybody who questions the system
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:20.880]  anybody who doesn't believe the lies being read off Obama's teleprompter is a
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.120]  conspiracy theorist I mean a month and a half ago we were conspiracy theorists
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.920]  and they were ground troops from the West and Libya and now it's been admitted
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.760]  but we only had the sources from Europe admitting it at the time but but but the
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:38.040]  issue I'm getting at here is the system is in trouble they've lost all
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.520]  credibility Congress has an 11% the president's got an all-time low for a
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.960]  president two years into their administration these big mega corporations
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.400]  are in trouble because now conservatives are finally figuring out the big
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.480]  mega corporations are not free market and are using big government and corporate
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.680]  welfare to not just fund themselves with taxpayer money but shut down their
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.720]  competition with regulations I mean ladies and gentlemen for like a week
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.720]  straight I dial through conservative and mainline radio and it's channel after
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.160]  channel they're saying the same thing I tuned in Glenn Beck last night saying
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.920]  the same thing I mean I've been monitoring every day for over a decade
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:24.280]  I've never seen something like this and you've got Brzezinski freaking out last
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:29.080]  year saying for the first time the entire world is awake to other global
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:34.440]  elite and we are in trouble and he's one of the top architects of this system
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:40.640]  under Jimmy Carter and now Obama one of his top foreign advisers on national
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:49.080]  security matters geopolitical matters and humanity is awake and staring for
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:54.600]  the first time in world history what do we get out of major high-level
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.200]  boulderberg group source directly from Tucker who again you can take to the
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:04.320]  bank and what we do without Tucker let me tell you boy he has put some miles on
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:10.440]  that body he smokes filterless palmals and he can drink me under the table back
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:17.360]  when I was sorry Tim's a great guy man he is a he is the real McCoy of an old
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.440]  timer type but not until his gum shooing is done you know when they're on
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.400]  assignment then well that's how reporters are anyways that's where you
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.000]  find all the big scoops I'm just in there with a patent paper while he's
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:40.880]  talking but Jim Jim is something else folks I mean how could anybody smoke
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:47.840]  filterless cigarettes one after the other but but side issue inside
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.400]  boulderberg inside boulderberg staring group because they have monthly meetings
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.760]  ahead of it regionally with smaller numbers of the leadership they are
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:01.920]  totally depressed freaked out and just want to bankrupt everybody thinking
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.920]  that if we're totally poor they'll use poverty like Mexico does or North
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:13.880]  Korea does as a way to just put us in abject despotism via the economic
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:19.240]  weapon of impoverishment so we're controlled and they are and by the way
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:24.200]  I don't have to believe Jim Tucker even though trust but verify the globalists
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.320]  are always saying this publicly they want to post industrial world so I want
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.840]  to finish up with the good news and then some of the bad news because the good
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:35.880]  news is we're waking up to these crooks the bad news is they foresaw that we'd
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.520]  wake up not this much but they foresaw it so they put a police state in
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.280]  worldwide to try to suppress us when we did wake up just we're waking up a
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.160]  little bit earlier than they thought we would and their old timetables behind
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.400]  schedule the point is the fight is on we're and we're in the fight we're on
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:59.640]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:06.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:10.680]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.640]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.280]  turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.880]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:28.240]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.520]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:07.320]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.360]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:14.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.240]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:23.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:27.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:31.640]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:35.280]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:39.440]  you know earlier in the week these internal recordings started coming out
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:44.600]  of Obama to big fundraisers and I was reading reports where they make
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:49.320]  reporters pay tens of thousands of dollars even get into these things and
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.440]  they don't even let them record but some of course sneak and do it and there's
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:57.720]  Obama up there talking about these evil bankers and how they want to get us
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:02.240]  well his whole administration is run not by your corner bank not by the bank
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:05.840]  down the street that does a great job loaning money out not by your credit
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:13.960]  union not by your local savings and loan but by the big six megabanks and to
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:19.320]  hear all of the conservatives I mean all of them and it's it's a talking point
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.200]  from this show not a talking point from the old George Bush days and the
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:29.920]  White House bought and paid for by the same interest via self-preservation all
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:35.320]  of these middle class and upper middle class and nouveau rich people thought
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.720]  they were part of the elite helped cover up the Bilderberg group of the New
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:43.640]  World Order I remember all these mainline talk show host Limbaugh and
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.720]  others for years there's no such thing as the Bilderberg group Cooke
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:51.160]  detector he played the sound of helicopters in the background really the
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.560]  Miami Herald and bunch of other newspapers reported on black helicopters
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:03.280]  doing takeover drills but again they would make jokes about it well it
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.320]  doesn't work anymore when they laugh at us talking about this they get laughed
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.760]  at and so now listening to all of them they're explaining that there's a
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.800]  super rich elite that want collectivism and that get the government corporate
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.040]  welfare and that use regulations to shut down competition and I was stuck in
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.040]  traffic doing errands last night left a little early and I listened to almost
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:31.560]  all of Glenn Beck's show and the whole show was examples throughout history of
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.040]  how elites use government to shut down their competition and how the Federal
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:39.880]  Reserve wants a world government and how socialism is designed by the elites to
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:46.160]  impoverish and make people dependent and I am literally beside myself I got home
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.240]  my wife was like why are you so happy because I'm usually not unhappy but
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.960]  focused and quiet and you'd think I was allowed and bomb bombastic like I am on
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.320]  air I basically just do the research and explode on air but and I was like honey
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.360]  we're winning I mean a folks I'm listening to the local host the national
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:08.640]  host I'm just going to the channel going is this a joke and they're all
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:14.560]  saying it they finally got it and it's like those hidden images that came out
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.840]  in the 80s and they had t-shirts that would do what have an image made of a
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:24.840]  matrix of dots and you're like you'll have a caption above it that says can
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:30.680]  you see the hidden image and you look at it and you step back and you can't see
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.960]  it and then you get in the right spot you go whoa it's a bird or it's a turtle
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:40.800]  or it's a it's a face how did I not see that once you see it you can't believe
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:48.040]  that you never saw it before when it's hiding in plain view it's like those
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:55.280]  famous paintings where it's a woman sitting at her nightstand or makeup
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.080]  table putting makeup on and she's a beautiful woman but then you can reverse
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.440]  it and it's an old woman or you can reverse it to the and it's a skull what
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.520]  do they call those we should put it on screen for prison planet TV viewers old
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:15.320]  paintings that show old paintings that show a beautiful woman and a skull that
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.200]  will probably bring it up and then you flip it and it's the skull see that's
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.840]  how the new water works they show you the this side they want you to see they
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:29.440]  tell you what you're seeing when they put an image up oh we're liberating it's
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:35.720]  not a war but you look at another angle they're not liberating it is a war so
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.320]  it's not just two-sided it it's that it's like a deceptive cloaking device and
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:45.280]  once the cloaking device falls everybody goes what it's the private fellow
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:51.200]  reserve it's JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs funding the carbon taxes funding
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.920]  the corporate welfare funding the regulations to shut down their
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:01.120]  competition and once you got that you can go to the working class you can go
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:03.920]  to the middle class you can go to the new voracious you can go to the
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.200]  independent billionaires above them and you could say do you understand how
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:12.480]  history works humans build the same systems over and over again powerful
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:18.040]  inside elite groups going back to Rome you name it this is what Caesar did they
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:22.720]  get together and say why should we have this big giant middle class let's just
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.200]  basically bring in foreigners to be our police to supplant the Romans and
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:32.920]  basically take their property and then give part of it to the outsiders and
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:38.080]  that's what immigration is about all of it immigration will be fine if they
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.400]  got here we're taught American pride taught Bill of Rights taught
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:46.760]  Constitution handed a firearm once they became citizens but they're not they're
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:51.360]  taught collectivism political correctness anti-gun anti-private property and the
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.920]  globalist are racing to bring in the Eastern Europeans and the Latin Americans
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:01.000]  and the Asians and everybody else who come from total despotic socialized
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.400]  systems run by the banking cartels already or their own version of corrupt
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.840]  elites that operate the same way to tropism you know what a tropism is
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:14.800]  looking up folks we give you the definition of a tropism did did we
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:20.160]  find there it is there it is Charles Allen Gilbert and let's click on the
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.560]  image and it's a beautiful woman in her evening gown putting makeup on with her
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:31.480]  perfume in front of her and then it's a double image that it's a skull and there's
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.640]  a whole class of those there's some other ones where you flip it over and it's an
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:40.920]  old woman or you flip it over and it's a skull now they've done studies and you
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:45.320]  just pull these up just type Americans five times more narcissistic than any
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:50.000]  other country and psychological studies that's from 60 years of TV training us
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.720]  to be spectators and live in La La land this all gets into mind control we can
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:59.840]  also pull up psychological studies that Americans now because we're the center of
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.000]  the New World Order it's not that we're bad we were the best so the globalists
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.200]  had to really concentrate on us and tested all out on us to get us under
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:11.320]  their control so they could use us as their modern Hessian global mercenary
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:17.480]  system but in studies Americans also have more trouble than anyone else in the
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.280]  world and studies recognizing double images recognizing hidden in plain view
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:27.080]  I mean I look at that image and I instantly see the skull but we'll put it
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:33.760]  back on screen now they've done studies in colleges in the US most people you
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:40.440]  pull these numbers up most people cannot see that skull if you're watching on
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.520]  prisonplanet.tv right now we're gonna do an article about this or you know what
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:49.920]  let's make that the cartoon of the day now at the bottom of info wars.com
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.640]  right hand side we'll take that political cartoon down that shows Obama
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.960]  crushing people with debt saying we've got to take more debt let's replace it
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:01.880]  with that and put under it maybe beauty is on the eye of the beholder or
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:09.440]  something but the issue is there we'll put it back on screen you you are an
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:14.120]  informed audience looking deeper into things on average people watching right
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:18.000]  now over like of course you can see the skull remember in studies and they've
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.800]  actually used this photo in studies and similar ones most people cannot see that
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:32.120]  skull they cannot see it so this is what's happening all these talk show
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:39.120]  hosts can finally see the skull right there in their face all they can see is
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.640]  the beautiful lady see she's the distraction why do you think a magician
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:49.960]  generally uses a beautiful assistant wearing a tiny skirt or no skirt at all
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:59.120]  basically you know in fishnet stockings or a garter belts why do you think they
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:03.560]  do that because when you're busy looking at her when you know when she's
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:07.040]  presenting herself to you he can do the sleight of hand and get the rabbit from
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:13.200]  under the table and once you can see the rabbit once you can see the trick once
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:20.520]  you can see the skull it's over hidden in plain view and there's some great job
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.600]  finding that with the limited info I gave you there's a whole class of those
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.040]  I bet that Wikipedia article I'll have links because in the 18th 19th century
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:32.640]  that was all the rage for over a hundred years towards the latter part of the 18th
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:39.840]  into the 19th century and then into even the 20th obviously but but I digress
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:43.720]  there's a lot of news here to cover it's just we've got to understand that
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:49.600]  hidden in plain view is a corrupt evil elite who own both parties they're good
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.760]  people in both parties there are more good people in the Republican Party
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:57.280]  because they are the group that at least has to pay lip service to the old
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:03.320]  Republic they have to at least pay lip service the left pays lip service to
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.880]  freedom and democracy and anti-war anti-torture anti-spying but you notice
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.560]  Jimmy Carter gives you FEMA Jimmy Carter gives you police state and it just
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:20.880]  continues with Obama because it's two wings on the same bird of prey I'm not
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.480]  looking at the wings I'm looking at the head of the bird the skull of the bird
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:30.440]  the eyes of the bird that are attached to the brain of the bird and I'm looking
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:34.880]  at the talons of the bird the face scanning cameras the checkpoints the
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.040]  police being taught there is no fourth amendment the warrantless wiretapping the
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:43.440]  the police with automatic systems that break into your phones and download
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:49.920]  everything all being announced those are the talons the wings carry the bird
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:57.720]  keep people in the political paradigm but the talons are the enforcement arm
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:07.560]  the talons and the legs and the heart is the American taxpayer funding and
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:13.920]  pumping oxygen through the system but that head that head the trilateral
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:23.400]  Commission Bilderberg group those are the eyes the connect to the brain or you
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:28.920]  could say the intelligence agencies of the eyes the issue here is start really
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.600]  studying history and then once you do you're not going to be into baseball
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.240]  anymore you're not going to be in a football anymore like you were you're
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.640]  not going to be into acting cool your buddies and telling jokes at the bar
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:45.480]  anymore once you find out about history it will consume you reality will consume
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:49.720]  you when you realize that this global elite doesn't just want to dominate and
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:53.920]  take everything over that they openly say at the UN biological diversity
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:45:00.480]  assessment 1996 the State Department of random 200 the countless statements and
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:06.000]  documents and official US and British policy since 1949 is to establish a
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.280]  global private corporate government extinguish local state and federal
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.440]  sovereignty and to then set up a total control grid to carry out an organized
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:23.440]  one-world one-child policy that will then phase in genetic testing to be able
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:28.840]  to have children and then licenses to even have one children one child and
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:34.400]  then to actually release bio weapons to forcibly reduce populations and they've
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:38.160]  built the cadres of eugenics scientists who believe in this who they test
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.040]  injecting little kids all over the world with live polio as they've been caught
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:46.680]  associated press just last year over and over again worldwide and live syphilis
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:52.600]  not just black people 50 years ago everybody and then when you realize
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.080]  this is going on and that they're putting radioactive isotopes in our
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:02.320]  water CBS News Texas oh they're putting it in the water but we just want to know
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:06.960]  why they covered it up if you're a new listener you're like this guy's crazy
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.520]  oh really I'm crazy why don't you write down everything I'm saying get in front
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:19.240]  of a search engine and get ready get ready because I didn't make up anything
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:26.520]  you see weak-minded people choose to not believe I've had Nightline here MSNBC
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:34.680]  Rolling Stone New York Magazine Texas Monthly list goes on and on hundreds of
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:38.040]  newspaper interviews over the phone and I'll say the thing oh so you believe the
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:44.040]  government wants to kill us haha 80% I go would you like me to send you dozens
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:48.680]  of statements at the UN just last year Ted Turner saying global government once
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.320]  held policy would you like me to send you David Rockefeller New York Times
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.440]  calling for it saying how great Mao was would you like me to send you the
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:03.440]  statements from the UN would you like to send me the world population program
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:10.520]  1949 issued by his Royal Highness as a program in England would you like to
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.300]  read the statements by the World Wildlife Fund would you like to understand
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:19.280]  eugenics social Darwinism Malthusianism would you like me to send it all to
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:22.960]  you would you like to send you hundreds of quotes of Nobel Prize winners like
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:27.240]  Bertrand Russell the list goes on and on saying the exact same thing and then it
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:35.800]  goes back to Plato 2,500 years ago or 2,350 I forget the point is writing
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:41.400]  books about how they should breed the lower classes to be mindless slaves or
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:46.240]  maybe just go ahead and kill them all and use war to do it and that he is
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:52.720]  sourced by Sir Malthus he is sourced by Darwin he is sourced by the social
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:48:01.360]  Darwinists eugenics started in England 160 years ago roughly 1850 Galton the
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:07.840]  cousin of Darwin I'm not getting into debates about evolution the point is
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:13.480]  they are saying social Darwinism that it's their right to enslave us their
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:17.360]  right to kill us because they got in positions of power that means they are
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.400]  the fittest that means it's their right you may have heard of this Adolf Alois
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:29.520]  Hitler who in Nuremberg have you read the your Nuremberg trial just type
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:35.880]  Nuremberg eugenics defense and they the Nazis got up and said yeah we injected
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.120]  little kids with stuff yeah we killed people yeah we did medical experiments
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:44.120]  yeah and Hitler gave speeches and wrote letters to Margaret Singer and I've
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.560]  got it an end game and all these other top eugenicists on White House and
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:50.840]  Rockefeller payroll and the Rockefeller family funded the Kaiser
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.240]  Velhelm Institute for the Nazis from the 20s before they even got into power
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:00.720]  right through it and IBM run by Thomas Watson who traveled to worship Hitler
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:06.840]  and who gave him the machines and the IBM technicians to put the tattoos on
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:10.440]  people to that's the code number they would enter in the machine to decide
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:14.040]  how long to work them or when to kill them they would measure their body fat and
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.160]  age and all this and enter it and the machine would tell him who to kill and
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:25.240]  who not to kill you know I've told this story my dad was top of his class when
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:31.560]  he was a junior in high school and he was sent to the Texas science academy
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:38.720]  thing and he and he was and he and he won an essay about fighting the communist
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:42.440]  threat and all this stuff in Dallas on a radio station so he got real popular and
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:48.400]  he traveled around and gave speeches the point is my dad when he got to UT as a
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:52.160]  sophomore in high school over the summer they then tested thousands of people and
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:55.160]  they took the cream of that crop and called them in behind closed doors and
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.360]  said we're gonna set up a world government and by the way this happened
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.040]  to anybody who was top of their class just like model UN goes after the top of
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.080]  the class training the kids had to be UN bureaucrats and he saw what it was and
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:17.120]  said no way and ran from it and this is gone all over the world and again I've
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:21.800]  told the story his Jewish professor who was the head of the botany department
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:26.280]  later his Jewish professor when he went to UT but then in high school he was
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:31.720]  one of the heads of the program his name was spear he called him in he said
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:35.920]  Hitler was bad because he was only going after certain groups we're going after
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:42.840]  everybody black Jewish German Chinese because he was obsessed with breeding
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:47.000]  plants and moths and all this stuff and he said we're gonna make the you know the
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.680]  super system and you're gonna be part of it and there was these other UT
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:55.720]  officials and then Aaron Dykes went to UT decades later and they taught basically
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:00.240]  the same stuff then they tell the general public there is no new world order
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:04.560]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:08.520]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:12.120]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:15.520]  gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:19.320]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at

[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:06.400]  for today's modern smoker and my dad a few months ago did correct me
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:10.960]  specifically the UT people were like Hitler was bad going around just
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:14.200]  killing certain groups it wasn't that they were gonna kill everybody it was
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:17.640]  that they were gonna have one-child policies and basically phase out the
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:23.680]  dumb people and so that's why if you read any major futurist book put out by
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:28.600]  transhumanist the eugenicist this is all they talk about it's all Ted Turner
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.480]  Prince Philip all of them Queen Beatrix this is their religion and that's my
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:38.320]  point they think it's good to get rid of you now we've got Bob Chapman coming up
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:44.040]  on the economy S&P downgrading the outlook for the dollar retaining a
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:48.280]  triple-a rating the u.s. retaining its credit rating here's a p-day Greek
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:52.400]  prime minister ratings agencies are running our lives well that's the plan
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:58.440]  and that's what the big banks are doing the nation will even more bankrupt
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:01.680]  once we got to pay more interest to these private bankers for the right to
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:07.160]  even use our own currency and we've got some of these other headlines oil
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.840]  lifted by weak dollar and volatile trade because it's Friday I guess a good
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.600]  Friday the day before or two days before Easter the markets are closed here
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:20.920]  and they expected because of lighter trading for gold and silver to correct
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:26.000]  a little bit before continuing to go up but no gold and silver are up in the
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.360]  foreign Asian markets and that's because the dollar is down now there are
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.320]  some put options in the next month for gold and silver to go down but there are
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:43.360]  more of the other options the calls for it to go up regardless the dollar this
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:48.360]  isn't the hunt brothers trying to corner silver and 80 this is and this is
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:52.480]  what all the analysts are admitting this is the dollar and other currencies
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:58.240]  devaluing and people and institutions like universities running to secure
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:01.840]  something and it doesn't mean it's a perfect silver bullet they could pull
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:05.520]  some manipulation and drive it down but it always just goes back up in the last
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:11.080]  11 years Ted Anderson tell us the prices on the specials of the gold and
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:14.160]  silver you bought in the last month the stuff you bought two months ago sold
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.080]  out so prices have gone up it is better than anything else I've seen out there
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.480]  the silver dollars the silver half dollars the gold francs the sovereigns
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:26.880]  the American eagles the buffaloes all of it you got some great
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.480]  deals but this is amazing because you and I talking last night expected gold
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:35.240]  and silver to go down a little bit today but it didn't it only went up yeah I
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:39.000]  know it did it went up and now in the Asian markets like you said with good
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.720]  Friday the markets being closed not only here in the United States but also in
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:50.880]  Europe but Asia the market strong 1507 50 gold that's up a dollar 80 46 72 silver
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:56.600]  that's up to and generally the major markets in the West being closed would
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.680]  automatically lower prices because volume goes down the opposite is happening
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:04.760]  that's a big sign that it's gonna explode next week yeah well that's that's
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:07.600]  what it is I mean the Asians are the one that are so concerned about the United
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.960]  States dollar I mean let's face it China wants to get away from the United
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.440]  States dollar I'm gonna hold that price up right through Easter Sunday here on

[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:40.520]  gallon by the end of next year as part of the system to bankrupt the general
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.560]  public and to take excess dollars off the global market and send them back to
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:49.000]  the globalist they feed them out there into the economy and then they suck them

[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:10.480]  the Congress that put this into law in 1996 so we're gonna be going over that as
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:16.800]  well we're gonna be going over what's happening with the 9-11 responders to be
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:21.720]  warned they will be screened by FBI's terrorism watch list this out of the
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:26.800]  George Soros Huffington Post a provision of the 9-11 health bill may add
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:31.160]  insult to injury for people who feel sick after the service in the aftermath of
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:36.000]  the 01 Alciida attacks that we can post is learned tens of thousands of cop
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.040]  firefighters construction workers and others who survived the worst terrorist
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:44.160]  assault in US history and risked their lives in the wake of the will soon be
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:47.320]  informed that their names must be run to the FBI's terrorism watch list according
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:51.000]  to a letter obtained well we've got the Homeland Security internal documents
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.560]  from two years ago their number one group they spy on as veterans and gun
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:03:02.040]  owners any of the responders who are not compared to the database of suspected
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:05.600]  terrorists would be barred from getting treatment for numerous worsening
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:11.320]  ailments remember Homeland Security Ridge the head of it years ago sat on
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:14.680]  c-spanning so you're gonna have a job you know to have a job you're gonna have
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:18.560]  that Homeland Security authorization to work at 7-11 anywhere so now to get
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:21.800]  health care you're gonna have to go through them that's like I've got the
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:26.960]  clip of Rahm Emanuel saying we want to put you on a no-fly no-gun buy they put
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.680]  you on a list don't tell you why no judge no jury no conviction now they want to
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:35.600]  put you on a no-gun buy list they've introduced that legislation and he's
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.680]  been pushing it for years and now I guess they fought for their health care
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:43.760]  from the deadly dust that the government told him wasn't dangerous and so
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:48.280]  they're gonna run them through a terror database and no judge no jury no
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:52.480]  conviction just if they feel like it they'll be denied health care any of
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:55.840]  the responders who were not compared to the database suspected terrorists would
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:59.520]  be barred from getting treatment for numerous worsening ailments that the
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:06.360]  James Zadarok 9-11 health aid compensation law was passed to address is a
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:10.520]  requirement that was tacked on to the law during the better debates over it
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:15.080]  last year the letter from Dr. John Howard director of the National Institute of
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.640]  Occupational Safety and Health and former medical providers and
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.080]  administrators that they should begin letting patients know the new program
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:26.640]  kicks off this July this is absurd well no you it's not absurd I said Glenn

[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:15.280]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true

[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:23.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:27.560]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:31.360]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:33.160]  work of Bob Chapman at the international forecaster.com I want to get into
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:38.080]  S&P I want to get into what their move saying that the outlook for the US
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:42.040]  keeping its triple-a rating is not good it's only happened one other time in
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:48.160]  1941 and the week after Pearl Harbor silver gold exploding even though the
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:52.680]  European and North American markets are shut down for Easter coming up on Good
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:59.680]  Friday I want to get into a lot of issues but first going to Bob Chapman this
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:08.640]  bombshell report put out by Jim Tucker with his inside sources in Bilderberg
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:12.520]  that have been proven accurate over the years I mean he's called it all because
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:16.440]  these guys are running the show he said they're very frightened they're very
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:21.280]  scared mirroring what Cass Sunstein said at the White House within the
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:25.480]  documents that have been leaked and admitted to be real what Bersensky said
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:29.400]  last year on C-SPAN that humanity is awake and staring at the elite and
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.180]  they're in trouble he said David Rockefeller in his wheelchair which we
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:38.800]  just saw him down in Chile he is in a wheelchair now 96 years old Kissinger
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:43.680]  his valet his gopher and other top globalist at a Bilderberg steering group
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:48.000]  meeting ahead of the meeting in June in Switzerland these also were meetings in
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.880]  Europe three of them that they are panicking they are scared and they've
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:55.960]  decided to go ahead and raise the oil prices in the next year and a half to
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:01.680]  $7 a gallon in an attempt to impoverish us like Mexico or North Korea does to
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:05.640]  make us so poor we can't do anything but try to survive and we know that's their
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:12.240]  public policy of post-industrial America with the green carbon taxes and that
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:16.600]  Kissinger is pushing for the full-on ground invasion of Libya and that
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:21.480]  they're hopping mad that alternative media forced the LA Times New York Times
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:26.600]  Washington Post to report that Al Qaeda is the core of the Libyan groups being
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:31.320]  backed by the West they are in three different meetings which makes them
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:36.640]  dangerous Bob very very scared right now and that means they're more dangerous
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:43.200]  than ever Bob Chapman military intelligence author biggest private for
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:46.600]  those that don't know him one of the stations biggest newsletter financial
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:50.200]  newsletter in history till he retired came back the biggest private silver and
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:55.160]  gold broker of just amazing foresight on what's happening this really concurs
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:59.600]  with your overall analysis and your military sources that the system I
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:03.520]  mean I'm hearing it all over talk radio now now mainline people are saying the
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:07.760]  ultra-rich are robbing the middle class conservatives are not just worshiping
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:11.760]  mega corporations they finally have shifted their paradigm and said both
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.080]  parties are owned the ultra-rich are waging war against the middle class
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:20.480]  because the the the middle class and new vorice have figured out they weren't
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:25.080]  gonna have seats at the new old-order table Bob I mean this is so exciting
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:28.520]  what's happening but we've got to know the Empire's got us is gonna strike back
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:34.640]  give us your analysis well first of all that was great and secondly we have
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:40.400]  talked about that months ago and I'm glad they're picking up on it and I'm
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.560]  glad they're terrified because they should be because we're not gonna take
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:50.840]  any prisoners and they're not either I think they'll expedite their program in
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:56.840]  the Middle East Gaddafi is caught in the middle actually fairly popular in his
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:02.320]  own country I see him running around in his Mercedes up through the roof with
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:07.040]  no guards around them and waving to everybody and they're all jumping up
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:11.080]  and down and waving but they're gonna go after it they want the bank and they
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:16.920]  want the gold they want the aqua fires and the oil they want to live a year in
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:22.600]  Africa calm and so on and they want living it to be the base of Africa calm
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:27.600]  Webster Tarpley said that two years ago in the Obama deception because it's got
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.000]  the water it's got one of the biggest gold reserves in the world it's got
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:39.280]  everything they need and now it's on well he's right he does wonderful work
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:46.120]  and yes he has been out in front of a lot of other people and I tip my hat take
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:54.480]  my hat off to him thank you very much we need more people like he I think there's
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:59.920]  going to be more turmoil as we go along here plus this all-out invasion that's
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:06.880]  why the president has asked for 25 was it 25 and 250 million whatever it was for
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:12.400]  more weapons to go into Olivia and they'll be sending troops in soon I'm
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:19.360]  sure that'll keep the pot boiling as well so people won't be looking at the
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:23.600]  stock market and the bond market the unemployment and all those other things
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:31.000]  in particularly the price of gold and silver and for those of you who didn't
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:37.600]  get in on gold and silver already boy this is a great time to do it I bought
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:47.880]  some more on yesterday and I recommend that you do the same the situation with
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:52.760]  gold is twofold number one it is the only real money and it's proved that in
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:59.760]  the last two and a half years in its silent battle with the dollar and now
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:05.760]  it's being also fed by another rocket which is higher inflation which Wall
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:10.760]  Street and others is finally catching on to so it's got a double rocket going
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:17.600]  for it probably go to 1600 1650 here back and fill for 75 100 bucks and then go
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:23.040]  to 2000 before the years out and maybe very soon silver totally different
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:29.000]  situation yes being driven by the possibilities of higher inflation but
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:35.200]  also we have that giant naked short position and you know people are talking
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:43.560]  about $50 being a barrier I've been in the markets for over 50 years and I know
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:51.080]  that when you look back historically at something that's this old that is the
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:56.160]  top on on silver you know usually there's resistance at a level because
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:02.240]  people want to get out but that's not true in this case and you know why the
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:11.120]  average investors 55 years old 40 years on to 55 is 95 there are no sellers up
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:17.560]  there they're all dead just think about that so you hear all this fall they're
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.400]  all about this happening in that happy isn't going to happen what is going to
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:28.400]  happen is that JPM and HSBC are gonna have to make a decision when do we call
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:34.640]  this game and I think it'll be between 55 and $60 an ounce of silver which is
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:43.280]  only 10 to $15 away and they get three choices partial default in other words
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:48.640]  holders of contracts we can't deliver silver we'll give you 30 or 50 cents on
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:55.880]  a dollar number two total default just walking away from it possible number
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:16:01.560]  three the Federal Reserve steps in and covers them and pays the people off
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:04.600]  which that's what that's what I think over either that's what I think is
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:08.440]  going to happen but Bob a lot of the listeners out there don't understand
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:12.160]  markets or don't have a great understanding of it in layman's terms
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:18.880]  there is a record short on silver in the next month but it's institutional
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:24.000]  investors the Wall Street Journal reports and that record short is dwarfed
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:31.520]  by a record call and so correct me if I'm wrong that illustrates that the smart
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:36.920]  money's on it only going up that's right they're taking delivery in the next
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:43.960]  month that would be May and and gold it would be a June and so they go and
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:50.760]  June's always a big month and as is May for delivery so we'll see how many take
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:55.680]  delivery but apart from that that's okay and that's good for the upside but the
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:00.960]  real twist here is what are they going to do and I think the American people
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:10.480]  will go ballistic if the Fed bales out JPM and HSBC why the number is this at
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:16.760]  $46 an ounce it closed higher than that on Friday Friday in the May
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:26.240]  month which is the real active month it closes 4669 up to 222 the debt there is
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:33.960]  about 90 billion dollars it's 55 to 60 bucks it's around 130 to 140 billion
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:38.160]  that's what the Fed will be on the hook for and so it's going to be very
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:41.840]  interesting to see what happens and even a Fed if the Fed takes them off the
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:46.240]  hook doesn't make any difference because it's going to reflect very badly on
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:50.560]  those paper content let me ask you this question though I mean again in layman's
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:56.200]  terms for folks out there Max Kaiser big stockbroker in his own right pushing
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:01.000]  this whole silver ron and predicting it here six months ago or more and pushing
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:07.920]  it since he's saying if it goes to 47 they're doomed and that they will default
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:13.360]  and I've tried to get the you know the the technicals on that from him but but
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:18.000]  why do you think you could be right but we just don't know the point is this
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:24.760]  what's going to happen after a default or a payoff and that is the the paper
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:30.120]  market such as the futures the gold and silver options the derivatives and those
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:37.120]  holding them are going to be in serious trouble and SLD and GLV the two exchange
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:42.160]  traded funds we don't know how much gold and silver they have but we do know they
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:46.640]  have copious amounts of those contracts what can the globalists do to try how
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.480]  will the Empire strike back how are they going to try to drive it down ahead of
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:56.640]  their shorts can't do it nobody'll sell it's incredible I mean go fight and try
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:02.320]  to find physical silver and just isn't happening I mean ask that Anderson how
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:06.360]  easy it is to get so you're saying there's no way you're saying the already
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:11.360]  there's no way out that that there's going to be some type of chicanery well
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:15.200]  there's going to be some kind of confrontation and it's going to ruin the
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.520]  paper markets is what I was getting at whether they'll stay in business or not
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:24.920]  remains to be seen and and that's because the people really want to do business
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:32.240]  on exchanges that don't pay off I mean that's ridiculous and so that means the
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:36.600]  physical market will become king and that's what we'll all be that's right
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:40.880]  they've been using the paper market to suppress the physical so you're talking
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:45.880]  about the lid being blown off the volcano erupting Bob that's right and what'll
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:53.800]  happen and let's say they capitulate at $58 on silver and they say we're gonna pay
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:57.000]  you cash or we're gonna have the Fed tell us what happens after the break Bob

[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:13.120]  okay Bob you were getting to how you see this shaking out you've got the floor
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:19.400]  breakdown this surge in metals and what it signifies exposing the paper
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:25.120]  fraudulent markets well it's going to do that that's for sure and when it does
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:29.520]  happen there's going to be a lot of disgruntled people and even if they get
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:33.080]  in paid cash because I don't want to let go of their silver positions and it's
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.640]  going to spread the gold as well and they'll both take off there'll be another
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:44.400]  leap forward where would it leap from with silver maybe 55 to 75 or 80 with
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:52.080]  gold maybe from 16 1650 up to 2000 we don't know but we should get a blast
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:25:01.200]  from it one of the different scenarios well the three scenarios is the one I
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:05.800]  did the three I just laid out the golden silver going to continue to go higher
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:12.240]  this is only one episode this is one battle that we won because they did
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:16.840]  something stupid and they agreed in their arrogance they should have never
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:22.360]  happened they should have been offloading that best turns position which they
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:26.840]  originally got when best turns went under which was short and they were and
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:31.400]  there was doing that for the US government it's just like the US
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:37.960]  government is semi-controlling these hedge funds offshore and they're going
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:41.360]  long and they're going short and nobody knows what they're doing except the
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:45.240]  government because the government's commissioning them to manipulate the
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:48.840]  market and by the way you said that decades ago they've recently admitted
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:53.880]  that they're coordinating with the hedge funds and the big brokerage firms and
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:58.040]  the big mega banks in this whole manipulation the plunge protection
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:04.200]  team is only one layer or facet now what does it signify with this S&P
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:08.080]  announcement that they don't have a good outlook for the dollar keeping its
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:17.600]  AAA rating S&P's known that since the beginning of September of 1971 after on
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:23.800]  August the 15th 1971 Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard from
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:28.480]  then it's been a fiat currency and from then on it's been a disaster as we all
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:35.880]  know and S&P is an integral integral part of the criminal organization that
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:41.360]  runs our country and they through extortion make companies pay for
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:44.760]  reports that they don't want and they're wrong companies by the way the Greek
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:48.920]  Prime Minister is basically saying the same thing about rating agencies in AP
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:52.960]  today but here's the issue we now know the White House tried to twist their arm
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:57.120]  not to issue this did they issue it so they would keep any other credibility
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:04.360]  they have maybe and I don't believe the story about the White House I believe
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:08.520]  that this is the setup I was going to get to that but I had to give you the
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:14.800]  background because they're criminals and the background you have now the next
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:21.880]  step why they did what they did they want to get legislation passed to cut
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:29.000]  back on Social Security and Medicare and so they're saying you have to clean up
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:35.720]  your act by cutting back on all these deficits and what has Ryan and the
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.880]  and then the Democrats as well been saying about cutting back oh it's got
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:45.800]  to be Social Security and Medicare and that's what we paid into and so that's
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:49.960]  what they're gonna go after and that's what S&P was up to you know I thought
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:54.360]  that myself that they don't they don't want to go after the banksters and the
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:59.840]  trillions in derivatives and the and the debt black hole they want to scapegoat
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:04.960]  Social Security and things and basically this is the austerity as more and more
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:11.960]  of the GDP and our taxes go to the banksters 26% of that budget goes for
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:17.240]  the military that's the highest number and then you have Social Security and
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:22.400]  Medicare which I think at 25 and 24 or something like that the point is they
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:28.320]  don't want to cut the military they want to keep on killing people and they
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:34.480]  want to keep on trying to control people and they do that by shooting at them and
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:38.200]  I'll tell you the people in the military are not very happy about it the
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:43.760]  professionals in particular as I talked to them all the time and so there's a
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:49.760]  continued awareness and a growing disgruntlement in the military at all
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:54.760]  levels but particularly among the offices and on non-com to a professional
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:59.680]  people well Bob that's the point I made earlier I was there that's the point I
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:03.600]  was making earlier in closing is I'm finally hearing all the neocon host
[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:07.240]  admit the Federal Reserve is evil and the head of the New World Order and
[02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:11.640]  engineering this I mean they're really starting to wake up because I think they
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:17.000]  realize they're being targeted that's right and all I have to do is go back and
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.720]  read the history of totalitarian regimes such as in Germany and Russia and
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:26.400]  they will find that the little help is like those guys out there who are
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:30.240]  competing with us and losing incidentally they're gonna be the first

[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:39.840]  Darker shame, darling, darker shame.
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:42.640]  Well, Gary Johnson is a Republican
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:46.600]  and serves as the honorary chairman of the Our America
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:47.120]  Initiative.
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:49.920]  He's been an outspoken advocate for effective government,
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:52.120]  lower taxes, winning the war on drug abuse
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:54.880]  by decriminalization, protecting our civil liberties,
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:57.840]  revitalization of the economy, and prompting
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:01.080]  entrepreneurship and privatization in 94.
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:03.840]  He was elected popularly as the governor of New Mexico,
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:05.360]  re-elected in 98.
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:08.120]  He couldn't run for a third time because of term limits.
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:11.680]  OurAmericaninitiative.com is his website.
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:14.320]  And he was traveling around the country three or four months
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:14.520]  ago.
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:16.680]  We had him in studio here.
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:18.040]  And he's got a book out, of course,
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:20.160]  or this new initiative out.
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:21.560]  And I pointed out that that looked
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:23.840]  like he was thinking about running for president.
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:25.880]  And he said, well, we're testing the waters.
[02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:28.440]  And so, going from memory, he may not have a book out.
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:29.600]  I'm going from three, four months ago when
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:30.720]  he was in studio with us.
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:32.720]  The point is, he announced yesterday
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:33.960]  that he is running for president.
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.520]  He thinks he can focus on New Hampshire
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:38.360]  with his libertarian slash conservative ideas,
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:40.000]  in many respects, similar to Ron Paul,
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.120]  except for the abortion issue.
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:45.080]  And so he joins us now to talk about a host of issues.
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:47.800]  Governor, great to have you back with us.
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:48.800]  Alex, it's great to be on.
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:52.560]  And the new website would be Gary Johnson 2012,
[02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:56.920]  in that I am engaged right now in the contest
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:58.800]  of running for president of the United States.
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:03.160]  I'm out here trying to get Republicans to check me off
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:06.200]  as their spokesperson.
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:08.840]  Well, there's only one other guy out there
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:11.240]  who I think's got a better record than you overall.
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:13.560]  And that's Ron Paul, obviously.
[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:17.120]  But at the same time, he is 75 years old.
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:21.080]  By him getting ready to announce soon, regardless,
[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:23.160]  he's going to educate a lot of people
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:26.160]  and kind of get ran position for the future,
[02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:27.960]  who's also really proving himself
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:31.200]  to be a constitutionalist and libertarian in the US Senate.
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:34.720]  But Gary, I really support almost all of your positions
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:36.880]  and think you are one of the best candidates light years
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:40.160]  ahead of Trump, Mitt Romney, all these other insiders.
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:43.280]  But let me get my one contentious bone out of the way
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:43.840]  with you.
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:46.520]  You are overall a states rights guy,
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:47.760]  but you are for a woman's quote,
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:49.880]  right to choose, at least in the first trimester.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:53.440]  That's better than being for partial birth abortion
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:54.280]  and things like that.
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:57.200]  But I mean, instead of the media framing it for you,
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:00.000]  where do you stand on abortion?
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.600]  I support a woman's right to choose up
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:05.320]  until viability of the fetus.
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:07.640]  As governor of New Mexico, I would
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:11.400]  have signed a bill banning late term abortion.
[02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:15.520]  I've always favored parental notification.
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:18.120]  I've always favored counseling.
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:20.560]  And I've always favored the notion
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:23.160]  of no public funds used for abortion.
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:28.560]  And I guess that is a libertarian view.
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:30.280]  But what about Ron Paul's argument
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:32.640]  that it should be a state rights issue
[02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:34.400]  that he goes on to say as a libertarian, what
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:36.160]  about the baby's rights?
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:37.520]  I mean, sure, the mother has rights,
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:39.440]  but what about the baby?
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:44.120]  Well, I would agree that it should be a state rights issue.
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:51.120]  And I also recognize that this is an issue that we may just
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:53.440]  have to agree to disagree on, meaning
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:57.360]  I do support a woman's right to choose.
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:02.040]  Now, garyjohnson2012.com, we appreciate you joining us so
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:03.680]  early into your announcement.
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:06.440]  What, you announced yesterday morning?
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:10.120]  Yes, announced here in New Hampshire.
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:14.600]  I think that, well, first of all, New Hampshire is really
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:18.480]  key for me, that you can go from obscurity
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:23.360]  to national prominence based on doing well in New Hampshire.
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:25.120]  And New Hampshire is a great place.
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:28.480]  I mean, New Hampshire, the people in New Hampshire,
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:31.480]  I think, recognize that they get to vet all the candidates
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:33.800]  and that they're going to do that,
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:35.320]  that they're going to go out of their way
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:36.800]  to meet all the candidates.
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.480]  And so it's retail politics at its best.
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:44.480]  It's cussing, discussing at every juncture.
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:46.920]  And that's a good thing.
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:51.560]  And as a result of doing well in New Hampshire,
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:54.160]  getting vetted by the voters in New Hampshire,
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:56.120]  New Hampshire really sets the stage
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:59.040]  for the rest of the country.
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:01.000]  Governor, let's shift gears into the areas
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.240]  where I really agree with you.
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:05.920]  You were on three, four months ago here, and you talked about,
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:07.080]  we're going to go bankrupt.
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:08.920]  It's a mathematical certainty.
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:10.400]  The budget is way too big.
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:13.320]  We've got the banker bailouts, the derivatives.
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:15.400]  Under this fractional reserve banking system,
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:16.640]  at the end of the Ponzi scheme,
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:19.040]  it's mathematically impossible for a new dollar
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:22.920]  to be created, a dollar of debt is created.
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:26.120]  And we have the Federal Reserve Head in Kansas,
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:29.040]  in Dallas saying, we've got to cut the budget.
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:32.320]  We've got to cut spending military welfare
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:33.200]  across the board.
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:35.160]  Banker bailouts have got to end.
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:37.560]  Or we're going to go bankrupt and Geithner comes out Friday
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:39.760]  and then Sunday and then Tuesday of this week,
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:42.320]  saying, if we don't raise the debt limit,
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:45.120]  if we don't increase spending, if we don't raise taxes,
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:46.760]  then we're going to default.
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:49.200]  But aren't we already technically defaulting
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:52.240]  with 70 plus percent monetization by the Federal Reserve?
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:53.640]  You know, as an economic guy,
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:56.120]  break down for us your concern about this,
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:58.320]  or your view on this S&P,
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:00.760]  saying they have a negative outlook towards the dollar
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:04.560]  and in U.S. Treasuries keeping their triple A rating.
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:06.080]  Well, you said it.
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:08.120]  I mean, you couldn't be said any better.
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:09.800]  We're buying up our own treasuries.
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:15.800]  So what we've done is we've delayed the economic collapse
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:18.240]  that is in the offing.
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:21.120]  We weren't buying up our own treasury debt.
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:23.600]  I think that we would see that happen tomorrow.
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:27.040]  I'm an optimist, and I think this country
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:28.680]  is a country of optimists.
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:30.920]  The only way that we address this,
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:33.000]  and that isn't to say that we still won't have
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:36.920]  an economic collapse because, in essence,
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:41.560]  we can't pay back $14 trillion in debt
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:46.560]  when our ongoing yearly deficit is $1.6 trillion.
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:50.000]  In the face of that,
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.720]  we're not going to be able to pay back $14 trillion.
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:58.000]  The only way that we potentially take on
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.760]  is to take on what is going to happen
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:04.080]  is to balance the federal budget at all.
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:06.720]  And I'm optimistic that we can do that.
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:07.560]  We can do this.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:08.400]  We can fix this.
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:09.400]  We went to the moon.
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:10.800]  We can fix the federal,
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:13.760]  but we can balance revenues with expenditures.
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:15.120]  But it has to be now.
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:17.720]  It can't be a 10-year plan
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:20.640]  that gets us a quarter of the way there.
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:22.480]  It needs to be now,
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:25.880]  and it needs to include a dialogue
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.840]  of Medicaid, Medicare, reforming Social Security,
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:31.680]  and defense.
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:34.280]  But as Rand Paul has said,
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:35.280]  I think you just echoed,
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:37.600]  if you don't cut it across the board,
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:40.280]  and if you don't get rid of these new banker bailouts
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:44.840]  and QE3 that they're now starting to push,
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:47.880]  no amount of welfare state being cut back
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:50.000]  is going to fix this.
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:53.360]  Well, I think that the federal government
[02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:58.360]  could cut Medicaid and Medicare by 43%
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:00.960]  that they could block grant the state
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:02.280]  a fixed amount of money,
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:05.680]  43% less than what we're currently spending,
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:08.920]  and leave health care delivery to the poor,
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:11.600]  and those over 65% to the state.
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:15.680]  50 laboratories of innovation,
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:18.120]  50 laboratories of best practices
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:22.160]  in which best practices would genuinely emerge,
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:24.440]  best practices would get emulated,
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:27.080]  there'd be failure, failure would get avoided.
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:28.200]  This is what we need to do
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:30.040]  when it comes to Medicaid and Medicare,
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:32.000]  and there are also other suggestions,
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.360]  health savings accounts,
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:36.080]  if you're talking about somebody just starting out
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:36.920]  in the workplace,
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:38.160]  they're all sorts of work.
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:40.640]  Well, exactly, as they throw more money,
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:42.280]  as they throw more money at it,
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:43.560]  that's supply and demand,
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:46.120]  the price only goes up
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:48.000]  because the government is artificially doing that
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.520]  before we had any government involved,
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:52.960]  we had the best health care in the world 50, 60 years ago,
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:54.360]  and now it's all being phased out,
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:55.240]  and you're right,
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:41:58.440]  just like with the schools systems in the country,
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:00.000]  I've seen numbers in some schools
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:03.080]  where half of the money is bureaucracy,
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:05.480]  it's the same thing with the federal bureaucracy
[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:08.920]  that they've just tried to add more to with Obamacare,
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:10.800]  that that's what I'm for cutting,
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:13.520]  is if you get rid of the Department of Health
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:14.360]  and Human Services,
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.000]  get rid of the Department of Education,
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.360]  I mean, that's the kind of cutting I want.
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.000]  So what would you do as president?
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.680]  Would you move against all those federal bureaucracies
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:25.040]  and just completely abolish them?
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:30.040]  Well, back to cutting Medicaid and Medicare by 43%,
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:35.800]  and giving it back to the state, hey, that does it.
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:40.080]  That, in essence, may in fact dry up
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:43.920]  all of the function of all those agencies.
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:45.640]  When it comes to education,
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:47.600]  we should be abolishing the Federal Department
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:50.160]  of Education from the standpoint
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:53.440]  that federal government gives the state's 11 cents
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:56.480]  out of every dollar that the state spends,
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:42:57.840]  that the state spends,
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:01.200]  but comes with 16 cents worth of strings attached.
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:04.000]  So we need to understand that it's really a negative
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:07.320]  to take federal money when it comes to education.
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:09.600]  Give it back to the state, give it all back to the state.
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:11.600]  Yeah, it's our money that was taken to begin with,
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:12.880]  it's our money that was taken to begin with,
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:15.560]  then they send bureaucratic strings back,
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:19.000]  federally trying to not let parents pack their lunches.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.840]  That's federal bureaucracy, banning dodgeball, softball.
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:26.520]  I mean, Governor, why do you think all over the country,
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:27.480]  the nanny state?
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:29.640]  I mean, my view is that it's being done
[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:32.200]  to set the precedent that to wipe our noses,
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:33.920]  we've got to get federal permission.
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:37.000]  What's your view of the feds moving all over the country
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.680]  to lobby states to ban summer camps
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:41.520]  because they're too dangerous?
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:44.280]  Well, I mean, I'm trying to keep up with you, Alex.
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:46.000]  You're just one step ahead of me.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.800]  Don't quite let me finish the last point, but...
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:50.320]  I'm sorry, go back to your last point then.
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:51.160]  Go back to your last point.
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:54.040]  No, no, no, just with the healthcare.
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:57.480]  You know, what you're talking about is arguably 60%,
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:58.640]  and I'm agreeing with you here,
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:00.680]  but you're talking about healthcare costs
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:04.200]  that are arguably 60% bureaucratic.
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:08.360]  The government could be engaged in a systematic process
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:13.040]  of getting rid of regulation and impediments
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:15.360]  for healthcare entrepreneurs
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:17.720]  that would want to enter into the healthcare space
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:19.160]  to deliver better products,
[02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:21.280]  better services at lower prices.
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:24.600]  Free market approach to healthcare,
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:27.920]  and by the way, healthcare is about as far removed
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:30.560]  from free market as it possibly can be.
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:33.640]  And then you move on and talk about schools
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:35.080]  and the fact that the federal government
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:40.080]  is dictating X, Y, and Z to Manchester, New Hampshire.
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:42.680]  Manchester, New Hampshire?
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:45.240]  Shouldn't Manchester, New Hampshire decide
[02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:49.560]  how it is they want to conduct schools for their kids?
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:52.600]  And for that matter, all across the country,
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:54.960]  one size fits all, doesn't fit,
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:58.640]  and one size fits all has us bankrupt as a country.
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:01.880]  The federal government needs to get out of our lives
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:05.120]  the unintended consequence of government
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:07.960]  and regulation and legislation
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:10.200]  that ends up just burdening us
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:13.000]  and adding cost to our daily lives
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:16.680]  as opposed to this notion of liberty and freedom
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:18.360]  and the personal responsibility
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:19.520]  that goes along with that.
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:20.880]  Sure, absolutely.
[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:23.120]  Former New Mexico governor Gary E. Johnson,
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:26.120]  Gary Johnson, 2012.com running for president
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:29.000]  up there focused in New Hampshire,
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.680]  shifting gears to geopolitical matters,
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:36.080]  not just with a defense spending, but that first.
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:37.440]  How much would you cut it by
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:38.840]  or give us a ballpark?
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:40.960]  And what would you do about all these new conflicts?
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:42.720]  I mean, if you were president right now
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:45.680]  and the UN said like they did a month ago
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:50.080]  to Obama attack Libya, what would a president Johnson do?
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:54.120]  Well, right now as you have to do every day,
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:56.600]  you've got an opinion on everything.
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:58.760]  I have to have an opinion on everything right now
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:01.360]  and I appreciate the arena that I'm in.
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:04.360]  So when it comes to Libya, you know what?
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:06.720]  I'm opposed to Libya and this would have been a day
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:08.360]  after Libya happened.
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:11.360]  I'm opposed to what we're doing A through Z.
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:13.920]  Where is the congressional authorization
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:15.880]  to go into Libya?
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:17.960]  Where is it in the constitution that says
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:19.600]  that because you don't like a foreign leader,
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:22.840]  you should go in and topple that foreign leader?
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:24.320]  Who are the rebels?
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:27.240]  Are we not in a civil war here?
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:29.480]  And don't five other countries right now
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:32.760]  in the Middle East qualify for the same military intervention
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:36.720]  that we have unleashed in Libya
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:40.560]  and under the umbrella of a no-fly zone?
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:43.120]  Isn't Saddam Hussein exist for 12 years
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:45.200]  under the umbrella of a no-fly zone
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:47.240]  and under the umbrella of a no-fly zone?
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:50.720]  Did not the atrocities in Bosnia occur?
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:54.200]  The unintended consequences of government.
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:58.400]  We take out Saddam Hussein, he's the check against Iran.
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:00.560]  Iran now raises his head.
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:04.000]  It's not a military threat to the United States,
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.320]  but we should remain vigilant to that military threat.
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:11.480]  So we need to stop nation-building across the world.
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:14.280]  We need to re-concentrate our military
[02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:17.920]  on being able to react to us being attacked
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:23.120]  for the notion of imminent danger,
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:27.120]  which Afghanistan, I would argue at the beginning,
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:28.680]  was totally warranted.
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:31.760]  We were attacked, we attacked back.
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:34.120]  That's what our military was for.
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:37.840]  We are at war with Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda.
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:40.920]  We should remain vigilant to the terrorist threat,
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:43.840]  but after six months of being in Afghanistan,
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:45.480]  we've wiped out al-Qaeda.
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:46.720]  They weren't there anymore.
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:47.560]  Here we are.
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:50.960]  We're there 10 years later building roads, schools,
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:52.920]  bridges, highways, and hospitals.
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:55.080]  Men and women are dying,
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:59.120]  and we're borrowing 43 cents out of every dollar to do this.
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:47:59.960]  Stop.
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:02.800]  Get out of Iraq and Afghanistan tomorrow.
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:06.120]  And I would have been opposed to Iraq from the very start,
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:08.800]  believing that there was never a national threat
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:10.240]  to our security.
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:13.040]  And if there was, we had the military surveillance
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:15.040]  capability to see that happen,
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:17.680]  and that we could have gone in and addressed that situation
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:19.120]  if it would have occurred.
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:21.760]  And there was no threat, no threat at all
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:23.720]  from Libya to our national security.
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:25.720]  There weren't any weapons being raised.
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:26.880]  And if there were,
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:29.160]  how come we didn't hear about that two months ago?
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:30.720]  We weren't hearing a thing about it.
[02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:32.000]  Well, they also lied to us and said
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:33.120]  they wouldn't put ground troops in,
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:34.160]  and they've had advisors there,
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:36.400]  and now are publicly talking about invading.
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:38.640]  And Gates last night, the Secretary of Defense,
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:40.480]  said this is not mission creep,
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:43.600]  so that's like saying a green tree is on a green tree.
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:44.880]  It's just incredible.
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:50.560]  Governor Johnson, backing up from all of this
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:52.120]  and looking at the big picture,
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:55.000]  are you concerned?
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:58.120]  I mean, is that why you're running,
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:48:59.640]  looking at some of the other candidates?
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:03.920]  Because hearing you on military issues of al-Qaeda,
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:05.640]  I guess you concur with Ron Paul,
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:06.720]  why are we being attacked
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:09.600]  if you bind the whole official fable,
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:12.160]  as the mainstream media and folks do,
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:13.600]  then we're being attacked
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:15.080]  because we have all these empires everywhere.
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:16.480]  We don't see Switzerland
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:19.000]  because they're not interventionists being attacked,
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.240]  but certainly nobody who's got a large military
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:22.680]  is gonna attack us because we've got
[02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:24.640]  all these nukes and weapons.
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:28.480]  But what about the issue of the fact
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:30.480]  that they continue to use the threat of al-Qaeda
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:33.320]  as a pretext to take the American people's liberties,
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:34.480]  i.e. the TSA,
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:36.960]  sticking their hands down people's pants?
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:41.280]  Well, I would have never established the TSA, never.
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:44.520]  I would have left airport security to the airlines,
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:47.840]  and I dare say today that we would be as safe,
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:49.560]  and it would be less intrusive,
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:51.480]  and I would have never established the Department
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:53.320]  of Homeland Security.
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:56.480]  States would have done just fine doing that,
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:57.920]  and as governor of New Mexico
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:00.800]  with all of the resources that came in
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:03.040]  for a Homeland Security
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:05.680]  and the Homeland Security Department
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:07.440]  in the state of New Mexico,
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:12.280]  I just gave that title to my Secretary of Public Safety
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:15.760]  and really no resources got added
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:17.120]  to what it was that we were doing,
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:20.520]  and I spent all my time trying to send off
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:22.080]  what would have been intrusions
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:27.080]  against the civil liberties of New Mexicans
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:31.920]  as opposed to going out and spreading the fear
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:36.920]  and the really fear more than anything,
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:38.720]  just spreading the notion of fear
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:41.120]  and that government is the only one to protect
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:43.960]  and that doing some of the things
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:45.960]  that were proposed right after 9-11,
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:49.960]  in my opinion, would have just been unbelievably cumbersome,
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:52.080]  would have taken away liberties
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:55.000]  and freedoms would have altered traffic
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:58.040]  with no justification whatsoever
[02:50:58.040 --> 02:50:59.360]  to have done any of that.
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:04.240]  If elected president, we've got Senator Al Franken
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:07.160]  saying he wants to have an investigation of Apple,
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:10.080]  Google phones, they're all involved
[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:12.600]  in these phones tracking your location
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:14.840]  and then when you sync them with the computer,
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:18.120]  transmitting it on to the telecom,
[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:21.160]  but Al Franken ought to investigate Congress, Governor,
[02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:24.000]  because I remember in 96 covering the fact
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.520]  that they ordered the phone companies
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:29.280]  and cell phone manufacturers by October 1st, 2001
[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:33.320]  to have all these systems built in with back doors.
[02:51:33.320 --> 02:51:35.280]  So Congress is freaking out over this,
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:38.560]  they passed a law ordering this infrastructure
[02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:39.520]  to be put in.
[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:42.920]  What would you do with all of the warrantless spying
[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:45.640]  and tracking and internet kill switches?
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:47.800]  And Obama wants an internet ID now,
[02:51:49.240 --> 02:51:51.080]  where you get a government issued ID
[02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:53.320]  working with private corporations,
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:55.800]  basically the White House holds your pass codes
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:58.600]  and they admit the IRS will basically look over
[02:51:58.600 --> 02:52:01.280]  your computer, you think that's a good idea?
[02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:04.080]  Well, no, just right off the top of my head,
[02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:05.640]  no, that's not a good idea.
[02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:09.120]  And I get back to my resume,
[02:52:09.120 --> 02:52:11.800]  you'd asked me earlier too, well, why are you doing this?
[02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:14.240]  Well, I'm doing this because I really think
[02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:15.200]  that I can make a difference.
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:18.120]  I really think that I can do a good job here.
[02:52:18.120 --> 02:52:21.120]  And as governor of New Mexico, I really enjoyed the job.
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:25.960]  I really enjoyed immersing myself in these issues,
[02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:28.280]  trying to understand these issues,
[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:30.840]  and then trying to make the best decision possible
[02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:32.640]  regarding public policy,
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:36.760]  and how it actually related to everyday living.
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:40.360]  And in that context, I've vetoed probably,
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:41.840]  as many I say probably,
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:44.000]  because I might be embellishing here a bit,
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:45.600]  but I don't think it's by much.
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:47.520]  I think I vetoed more legislation
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:51.160]  than all the other governors in the country combined.
[02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:55.360]  And so I really took a stand against bigger government
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:52:58.480]  and government intrusion, just like what you're talking about,
[02:52:58.480 --> 02:53:02.120]  and the unintended consequences of government.
[02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:04.960]  Government picks winners and losers,
[02:53:04.960 --> 02:53:07.600]  and as a result of picking winners and losers,
[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:10.880]  I think we as regular old folks, taxpayers,
[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:13.440]  we end up all taking it on the chin.
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:15.400]  Government should be in the business
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:18.840]  of providing a level playing field
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:21.680]  that all of us have access to this American dream,
[02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:23.600]  that if we're willing to work hard,
[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:26.800]  innovate, that we're gonna be successful in this country,
[02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:30.920]  as opposed to being held back or restricted,
[02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:35.920]  or whatever it is from having the freedom,
[02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:39.160]  having the freedom, having the liberty to do what it is
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:44.160]  that innately we know best for our own lives.
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:49.320]  The whole intrusion of government into surveillance,
[02:53:51.640 --> 02:53:53.680]  all these things that you're talking about,
[02:53:53.680 --> 02:53:55.000]  as governor of New Mexico,
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.360]  I looked at these kinds of things,
[02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:01.280]  and whenever I felt that those threats were present,
[02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:04.720]  and by threats, I mean threats to civil liberties,
[02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:07.000]  I'd like to think I stood up,
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:08.920]  and I always did the right thing,
[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:10.680]  and that's why I'm engaged in this.
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:13.480]  Everything's gonna cost benefit analysis.
[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:16.160]  Cost benefit analysis, well, just to be clear here,
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:18.040]  that's why I do respect you,
[02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:20.720]  even though I disagree with you on several issues,
[02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:25.400]  is you actually did do what you campaigned for
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:26.840]  once you got into office,
[02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:30.760]  and a lot of libertarians and others admire you for that,
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:33.520]  because just knowing that somebody is gonna do
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:34.920]  what they say they're gonna do,
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:37.640]  that's one of the main reasons I admire Ron Paul so much,
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:42.640]  is that that is a quality that we are severely lacking
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:48.240]  in Congress, in the White House, in government,
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.440]  in state governments, is people that A,
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:53.560]  do what they say they're gonna do,
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:57.240]  but also B, understand that if we don't have liberty
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:54:59.080]  and freedom, then we're not America.
[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:00.440]  This country isn't special.
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:03.560]  We could be North Korea, we could be Mexico.
[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:05.440]  It's the liberty that is the engine
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:07.720]  of all of this prosperity,
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:09.840]  and that's why I wish you a lot of luck,
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:11.400]  and the two or three minutes we've got left here,
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:12.640]  I just wanna give the website out,
[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:15.880]  garyjohnson2012.com,
[02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:19.880]  in closing, if you were on national TV,
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:21.560]  which you are every day multiple times,
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:24.920]  and you had two minutes to lay it out for people
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:26.280]  about the direction of America
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:29.960]  and what Gary Johnson stands for, you've got the floor.
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:33.480]  Well, we need to save this country tomorrow.
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:37.200]  We are on the verge of a financial collapse.
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:42.560]  We cannot pay back $14 trillion in debt
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:47.280]  when we're racking up $1.6 trillion in new debt this year
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:49.200]  and in the foreseeable future.
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  It's not going to happen.
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:54.360]  We landed on the moon, we can balance the budget,
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:55.920]  this, we can do this.
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:56:00.160]  This is not difficult, but we've got to engage in it.
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:02.640]  We're engaged in the opposite.
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:05.520]  And what is this country about?
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.880]  What did we fight World War II over?
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:11.600]  Did we fight World War II over Medicaid and Medicare?
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:16.600]  No, we fought it over our ability to have freedom,
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:22.360]  to be at liberty, to make our own decisions
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:27.360]  that don't impact others in any way whatsoever negatively.
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:32.760]  This is a country of liberty and freedom,
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:35.480]  and it also is the personal responsibility
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:37.040]  that goes along with that,
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:40.440]  something that we move further and further away from
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:42.120]  as opposed to embracing.
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:45.960]  Former Governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson,
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:48.280]  thank you for spending time in closing.
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:52.320]  Look, the Federal Reserve, the people running it,
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:54.200]  have a stake in us going bankrupt
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.480]  because they basically loan us the fiat currency
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:01.320]  and credit back and saying that we're gonna default
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:04.360]  if we don't spend more money when even S&P says
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:06.680]  we're gonna default as we're spending too much money,
[02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:09.200]  they're steering us right towards the rocks.
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:10.960]  Would you move to break up
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:12.880]  the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve?
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:15.080]  I mean, even Newt Yenrich is now saying that.
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:18.680]  Well, I would abolish the Federal Reserve
[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:20.960]  if Congress passed that legislation,
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:22.960]  but they're not gonna pass that legislation.
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:25.720]  And I realize some right now would advocate
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:27.600]  abolishing the Federal Reserve tomorrow,
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:29.520]  which would precipitate,
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:31.440]  which would bring about a collapse,
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:33.920]  which many argue would be healthy.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:35.880]  I'm gonna take the side here
[02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:38.960]  that we could actually forestall
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:44.960]  and actually eliminate the collapse
[02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:47.960]  by balancing the federal budget.
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:51.640]  And in that context, then, really,
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:54.760]  just being a debate and a discussion before Congress
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:57.240]  to actually rid ourselves of the Federal Reserve,
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:58:00.360]  to return these functions of the Federal Reserve
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:03.320]  to a competitive regional banking system.
[02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:07.480]  And to the Congress because there's no doubt
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:08.840]  we're going on the rocks here.
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:10.200]  Governor, look forward to speaking to you again
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:11.040]  in the near future.
[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:11.960]  Good luck with your campaign.
[02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:13.280]  They're in New Hampshire.
[02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:15.040]  Alex, thank you for having me on.
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:16.360]  All right, great having you.
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:18.000]  All right, there it goes, former governor
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:19.160]  of New Mexico, Gary Johnson.
[02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:21.960]  We'll be back Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:22.960]  Central Standard Time.
[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:25.680]  Everybody have a blessed and wonderful Easter.
[02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:27.200]  I don't care if Hollywood says,
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:29.240]  we shouldn't call it Easter.
[02:58:29.240 --> 02:58:31.640]  And can't call it Easter eggs,
[02:58:31.640 --> 02:58:34.360]  you gotta call them Easter spheres.
[02:58:34.360 --> 02:58:36.320]  But that's all they should talk about anyways.
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:39.000]  Back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., great job, crew.
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:40.320]  Big Bilderberg Group coming up
[02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:47.320]  on retransmissioninfowars.com.
