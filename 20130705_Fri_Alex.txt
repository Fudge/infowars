[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:35.400]  well I was going to take today off July 5th Friday July 5th 2013 and then Paul
[00:35.400 --> 00:41.280]  Watson and others host the show but just too much has happened too much is
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.480]  going on and so I'm not gonna sit here on the sidelines and I know that folks
[00:45.480 --> 00:50.480]  want to hear my breakdown on things my take on it and so we're here and we'll
[00:50.480 --> 00:57.320]  also open the phones up and get your take on things as well obviously
[00:57.320 --> 01:05.200]  Mohammed Morsi has been deposed starting about two days ago in a military coup
[01:05.200 --> 01:17.120]  d'etat or put over in Egypt now I have mixed analysis on this but overall this
[01:17.120 --> 01:21.840]  is a big blow to the globalist and this is not what they wanted they wanted to
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.280]  put the Muslim Brotherhood in al Qaeda in charge of every Middle Eastern and
[01:25.280 --> 01:30.760]  North African country and even spill that into Central Africa as well as the
[01:30.760 --> 01:35.920]  East Coast of Africa particularly but it also goes into the West Coast all the
[01:35.920 --> 01:40.600]  way down into Nigeria this is the plan the globalist crime syndicate that
[01:40.600 --> 01:44.280]  controls our government and other governments runs radical Islam on record
[01:44.280 --> 01:49.240]  I've been telling you that for 15 16 years I didn't even really understand
[01:49.240 --> 01:52.720]  that the first few years I was on air and being called the ultimate evil and
[01:52.720 --> 01:59.400]  conspiracy but now it's all openly admitted but it just hangs out there in
[01:59.400 --> 02:09.760]  plain view and the state and the system uses the fear of the Muslim extremists
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.040]  that they wind up and fund and control as a pretext to take our liberties and
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.080]  launch all these wars so it's really elementary what's going on so we're
[02:19.080 --> 02:23.480]  going to be going over some of that today also big NSA scandals that we
[02:23.480 --> 02:27.120]  told you about this years ago we told you about it last week with Wayne
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.320]  Madsen when it was a denotist and expunged out of the London Guardian and
[02:31.320 --> 02:37.200]  observer under government orders that the EU is spying illegally on all their
[02:37.200 --> 02:41.960]  citizens as well and sharing it with England and the United States and that
[02:41.960 --> 02:46.640]  we even use the foreigners to spy on us and then our so-called government spies
[02:46.640 --> 02:53.320]  on them it's total globalization training everyone to let foreigners rule over
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.280]  you just like you're now going to have Canadian police on this side of the

[03:46.320 --> 03:51.520]  unbelievable development the European states ordering an aircraft with a
[03:51.520 --> 03:59.600]  sovereign leader Morales to have his aircraft forced down believing that

[04:19.840 --> 04:24.240]  I saw MIT reporting on it then about 10 years ago when Tokyo started actually
[04:24.240 --> 04:29.600]  putting these in into soft drink machines and vending machines were at a
[04:29.600 --> 04:35.480]  distance it beams into your brain but it made people so upset in Tokyo and in LA

[08:30.840 --> 08:37.120]  through the lies and disinformation we are live ladies and gentlemen on this
[08:37.120 --> 08:47.640]  Friday the fifth day of July 2013 worldwide transmission okay let me try
[08:47.640 --> 08:52.480]  to be disciplined here and just tell you what's coming up today obviously the
[08:52.480 --> 08:59.600]  unbelievable military coup d'etat against Muhammad Morsi in Egypt a big
[08:59.600 --> 09:04.520]  deal this is not what the new world order wanted I'm gonna give you my
[09:04.520 --> 09:10.320]  research historical take on that first after I tell you what else is coming up
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.880]  Paul Watson wrote an article yesterday morning that went viral via drudge
[09:14.880 --> 09:21.080]  report dot com from info wars dot com homeland security conducts top secret
[09:21.080 --> 09:27.520]  July 4th drill TSA undercover agents to patrol transport hubs and we have links
[09:27.520 --> 09:34.240]  as sources on that to KTTV and the Los Angeles Times and there were indeed
[09:34.240 --> 09:39.760]  federalized police all over the US running warrantless checkpoints searching
[09:39.760 --> 09:44.640]  people's bags on highways roads downtown areas transportation hubs that is
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.240]  martial law it is martial law when Congress has told two years in a row
[09:49.240 --> 09:53.000]  that our military is under NATO command and Congress isn't over the power of
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.160]  the purse and the military it is martial law when the NSA spies on you
[09:58.160 --> 10:03.200]  without warrants committing felonies every single time it is martial law when
[10:03.200 --> 10:07.920]  85 billion dollars a month now for the last two years it was 40 billion a month
[10:07.920 --> 10:13.720]  before that previously under QE infinity is given to mainly offshore banks and
[10:13.720 --> 10:20.200]  private companies media companies manufacturing companies banks you name
[10:20.200 --> 10:27.680]  it 85 bill a month and Congress is told they can't be told who it's given to
[10:27.680 --> 10:32.760]  five years ago I have the Obama deception with clip after clip in
[10:32.760 --> 10:37.320]  Congress of them saying that and I was watching C-span during breaks last
[10:37.320 --> 10:45.000]  Tuesday of this week just this Tuesday and they were doing the same thing saying
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.760]  we won't answer your questions it's not even a news issue now that's called
[10:49.760 --> 10:54.640]  brazen tyranny and that's why it's going to get worse because the tyrants kind of
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.480]  have an orgy and then soon they figure out nothing can stop them and they just
[10:59.480 --> 11:06.560]  go completely wild until things come full circle and the military puts a stop
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.160]  to it that that tends to be what happens but then it just falls back into
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.160]  corruption because all of the corruption is in place it's very rare that the
[11:14.160 --> 11:17.560]  military stands up and something good comes out of it and I'll tie that into
[11:17.560 --> 11:20.960]  morris in a minute there's only been a few revolutions run by people like the
[11:20.960 --> 11:27.680]  original revolutionary boss of liberty George Washington who fought let's be
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.880]  conservative ten to one odds ten to one odds in a seven-plus year war and won
[11:33.880 --> 11:40.080]  through pure perseverance and then was offered to be king and gave it up and
[11:40.080 --> 11:44.360]  the king of England called him the greatest man alive in the world because
[11:44.360 --> 11:48.320]  their ancestors had all gotten it through military victories being generals
[11:48.320 --> 11:52.600]  and things hundreds of years before they knew how you became a king they knew
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.120]  how you set up a dynasty over what become the greatest empire the world had
[11:56.120 --> 12:02.280]  ever seen what I mean we might have George the 10th right now but he said
[12:02.280 --> 12:05.600]  no and went home to his farm
[12:08.800 --> 12:12.760]  I was at Barton Springs yesterday went and swam a half mile didn't have a lot
[12:12.760 --> 12:21.240]  of time after I jogged around town late and I walked in and I saw the coolest
[12:21.240 --> 12:26.720]  shirt ever I'm gonna make our own variant of it this was by Ranger up group
[12:26.720 --> 12:29.080]  of Rangers that put out great t-shirts I've seen them before and this guy was
[12:29.080 --> 12:32.320]  wearing this shirt it was red it was supposed to look shaggy with our in a
[12:32.320 --> 12:36.040]  distance but it was really a big track ordered hat in George Washington and it
[12:36.040 --> 12:39.700]  said the original revolutionary this is not product placement I'm gonna get one
[12:39.700 --> 12:44.160]  and on the back it said you know lead troops against overwhelming odds and
[12:44.160 --> 12:49.880]  won I was offered to be king turned it down and then had some other statements
[12:49.880 --> 12:54.240]  about George Washington that's what the fourth of July is all about not
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.160]  government making itself king and every bureaucrat making themselves a lord in
[12:59.160 --> 13:04.360]  your area and taking on the very same imperious arrogant attitudes towards the
[13:04.360 --> 13:10.400]  people it is disgraceful so I'm gonna get into that today all the time when I
[13:10.400 --> 13:13.040]  hear rebroadcast I say I'm gonna cover this I say I'm gonna cover that I don't
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.320]  get to everything I've got to tell you the stories of what happened yesterday
[13:16.320 --> 13:20.520]  just when I jogged around the Heikenbach trail and when I went swimming in
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.440]  Barton Springs in fact I'll tell that now then I'll get into Morrissey then I'll
[13:24.440 --> 13:28.720]  get into Homeland Security conducts top-secret July 4th drill federalizing
[13:28.720 --> 13:32.600]  police with grants to go out and run warrantless checkpoints that's police
[13:32.600 --> 13:37.240]  going under federal control literally urinating all over the Bill of Rights
[13:37.240 --> 13:43.320]  and Constitution in the name of safety well yeah safety for the tyrants also
[13:43.320 --> 13:47.320]  Jacari Jackson went down yesterday and filed the report this morning and we're
[13:47.320 --> 13:50.920]  gonna premiere it here at the bottom of the next hour to the armed march on the
[13:50.920 --> 13:58.720]  Texas Capitol and we've checked the laws you could not take weapons into the
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.480]  Capitol but off the Capitol grounds the police violated the law and violated
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.080]  Constitution and through color of law ordered people to take their clips out
[14:07.080 --> 14:12.440]  of their rifles which by the way weren't even loaded so disgraceful activities
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.000]  right there people say they complied and again these guys had the courage to go
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.600]  out with rifles on the street knowing it's legal and lawful but that people
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.800]  it's like seeing a black person after slavery was ended you know running their
[14:24.800 --> 14:28.240]  own business people would go and burn it down it's like hey you're not gonna run
[14:28.240 --> 14:31.720]  a business and be free that's the same thing we're having our own civil rights
[14:31.720 --> 14:37.480]  of having guns and openly carrying them to say look stop trying to put our guns
[14:37.480 --> 14:41.080]  in the closet so you can then ban them we're out of the closet with our guns
[14:41.080 --> 14:46.040]  we're not ashamed of it and still the Austin police the same ones that three
[14:46.040 --> 14:48.920]  months ago tried to say we couldn't hand out magazines downtown until I had to
[14:48.920 --> 14:53.400]  threaten to sue them low and behold went and violated the Constitution Bill of
[14:53.400 --> 14:56.680]  Rights along with the state police I'm gonna be showing that coming up total
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.760]  color of law I think I need to now just get around to it get a loaded rifle and
[15:01.760 --> 15:05.800]  go march up and down and then they'll try some they'll try some fake disorderly
[15:05.800 --> 15:09.480]  conduct or something I'll have cameras and I'll beat it and you know they try
[15:09.480 --> 15:12.200]  to slam my head in the ground or something and then say I resisted them
[15:12.200 --> 15:16.520]  whatever I mean at a certain point we got a sit at the front of the bus here we're
[15:16.520 --> 15:20.480]  not sitting at the back of the bus anymore and and just watching this it's
[15:20.480 --> 15:25.680]  got to be dealt with so Jacari Jackson is gonna be in here at the bottom of the
[15:25.680 --> 15:31.120]  hour Paul Watson's coming up later in this hour and Max Kaiser we just called
[15:31.120 --> 15:34.920]  him I thought hey why don't we try to get Max Kaiser on right before the show
[15:34.920 --> 15:39.080]  started because he predicted the bond market would begin to implode and that's
[15:39.080 --> 15:42.160]  now starting and even mainstream corporate media saying this maybe be
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.240]  be be the beginning of that now they may pump it back up or something they've
[15:46.240 --> 15:50.000]  got all sorts of insider trading tricks but but we'll find out with Max Kaiser
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.720]  last 30 minutes today just to give you an idea of how big this this broadcast is
[15:53.720 --> 16:03.400]  going to be so that's just some of what we're gonna be breaking down today and
[16:03.400 --> 16:07.840]  then I do want to mention a media ight and news buster article before the
[16:07.840 --> 16:15.400]  hour ends that are just another example of disinformation and I'm seeing this
[16:15.400 --> 16:21.320]  every day against mfallwars.com and yours truly where they will take
[16:21.320 --> 16:25.920]  something I've said that is mainstream media alternative media for reasons of
[16:25.920 --> 16:32.040]  jealousy reasons of envy reasons of establishment bootlicking especially
[16:32.040 --> 16:37.600]  when it's media matters run by the White House or MSNBC they will say and an
[16:37.600 --> 16:43.560]  edit clips of what I've said out of context to misrepresent what I've said
[16:43.560 --> 16:53.760]  so I will get to that briefly incredible incredible what they can do with
[16:53.760 --> 17:01.720]  editing and I don't know who edited it but it's just what they do and my
[17:01.720 --> 17:05.320]  listeners need to understand this is gonna happen more and more and it's
[17:05.320 --> 17:10.520]  generally off of calls you'll call in you'll say could this be weather weapons
[17:10.520 --> 17:14.240]  that hit Oklahoma the tornadoes and I say well weather weapons are real and
[17:14.240 --> 17:18.040]  here's the history and here's a Fox News and AP article and here's a daily mail
[17:18.040 --> 17:21.200]  story but I don't think this is probably a weather weapon but you can never tell
[17:21.200 --> 17:24.480]  because they've already modified the atmosphere so much they might may not
[17:24.480 --> 17:27.720]  even know they've done something that's causing a problem but I said it's
[17:27.720 --> 17:32.560]  probably a real tornado tornadoes are at 60 year lows here's USA today that
[17:32.560 --> 17:37.840]  turns into I said Obama sent the tornado and folks it's every day without

[18:05.640 --> 18:09.240]  were threatened by the fact that we're expanding people's horizons and getting

[24:19.200 --> 24:26.120]  problems to my trade many a soldier many a soldier shed his life blood on my
[24:26.120 --> 24:35.560]  blade all right folks we're live it is the fifth day of July 2013 and I have
[24:35.560 --> 24:41.200]  never been more aware of the tyranny and corruption and never been more driven
[24:41.200 --> 24:47.200]  to resist the globalist than I was yesterday I was literally on fire with
[24:47.200 --> 24:52.440]  the light of liberty brush fires were burning in my own mind and I had a
[24:52.440 --> 24:56.760]  desire to spread the brush fires of liberty into the minds of men and
[24:56.760 --> 25:04.200]  women everywhere and here I am and here you are I'm very honored and thankful
[25:04.200 --> 25:11.440]  that you're listening and it was almost like a pilgrims progress a few hours I
[25:11.440 --> 25:15.960]  spent down around the river and then going swimming listening to people and
[25:15.960 --> 25:19.920]  talking to people I ran into people laying there on the grass bragging about
[25:19.920 --> 25:24.320]  how they were going to work for the NSA to spy on people I I ran into people
[25:24.320 --> 25:28.440]  that walked up and said shut up you shouldn't have free speech in America it
[25:28.440 --> 25:34.440]  was it was bizarre but also ran into just incredible people that were totally
[25:34.440 --> 25:37.960]  awake and burning with the fires of liberty there's really a spiritual
[25:37.960 --> 25:43.080]  choice happening not just here but all over the world there is a great awakening
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.960]  happening a new enlightenment a new renaissance and the establishment knows
[25:47.960 --> 25:53.800]  that and is doing everything it can to suppress that spirit and you're gonna
[25:53.800 --> 25:58.680]  have a lot of people that decide to serve the evil and I look at people that
[25:58.680 --> 26:04.520]  serve the globalist how they how they're animated on power trips because they
[26:04.520 --> 26:10.160]  work for the system and they're such little people they're so pathetic I'm
[26:10.160 --> 26:13.600]  gonna break some of that down coming up but right now let's get into Muhammad
[26:13.600 --> 26:19.920]  Morrissey well this is what we know on record at the Grove Hotel in Watford
[26:19.920 --> 26:28.720]  England three years ago Google met with MI6 French intelligence German
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.760]  intelligence Dutch intelligence and others with Google running the meeting
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.400]  this has been the London Guardian Google's proud of it see see they love to
[26:37.400 --> 26:40.960]  brag about what they're doing and they all met and they and they said we're
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.440]  going to fund radical Muslims in North Africa into the Middle East and we're
[26:46.440 --> 26:49.920]  going to overthrow these countries and put al-Qaeda in charge of Libya and
[26:49.920 --> 26:55.000]  Syria and we're going to put Muslim Brotherhood al-Qaeda light who will then
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.280]  financially support them in control of Egypt in control of Iraq and they're
[27:00.280 --> 27:05.400]  even gonna try to do this in Iran and it is basically all Saudi Arabia working
[27:05.400 --> 27:11.360]  with the West to do this and cause a revolution between Sunni and Shiite and
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.320]  Sunnis are about 79% of the Muslims so it's the majority group the globalist
[27:17.320 --> 27:22.280]  are allied with and the core of that is al-Qaeda not attacking Sunnis here but
[27:22.280 --> 27:27.200]  that's just a fact most Sunnis aren't a bunch of crazy people crucifying
[27:27.200 --> 27:30.600]  Christians and mass and cutting their hearts out and eating them on TV I mean
[27:30.600 --> 27:34.440]  this is what's going on and blowing up churches every two or three days fire
[27:34.440 --> 27:38.480]  bombing mosques that are minority groups they don't agree with minority group
[27:38.480 --> 27:47.560]  Muslims crucifying Christians at the presidential palace in Cairo we post
[27:47.560 --> 27:51.920]  videos of this and YouTube takes them down and they take other people's down
[27:51.920 --> 27:57.240]  as well but this is all online I mean I see this stuff 5,000 al-Qaeda in a
[27:57.240 --> 28:01.760]  square chanting we will destroy America we will blow you up we will chop your
[28:01.760 --> 28:05.880]  heads off we will and there's a new video out today with them saying this
[28:05.880 --> 28:10.840]  the FSA fighters going after Assad America I will use missiles to destroy
[28:10.840 --> 28:15.560]  you and it's you know the it's I mean they're not playing games but then the
[28:15.560 --> 28:19.720]  cop you'll be at a checkpoints like line up I'm gonna search your vehicle you know
[28:19.720 --> 28:25.760]  after 9-11 things changed that government runs al-Qaeda the government is
[28:25.760 --> 28:30.120]  foreign banks this is why they hate me folks I'll just state the elephant in
[28:30.120 --> 28:36.800]  the room and so I don't like military coups people try to to romanticize the
[28:36.800 --> 28:41.320]  military coup here in America to restore the Republic it may have to come to
[28:41.320 --> 28:44.720]  that someday but by then it'll all be drones so it'll be almost impossible
[28:44.720 --> 28:48.520]  that's the globalist checkmate they're going to but they have things playing so
[28:48.520 --> 28:53.680]  horrible that they plan to go after the military and police who won't play ball
[28:53.680 --> 28:57.440]  that's why they say the new terror threat is veterans gun owners in active
[28:57.440 --> 29:02.080]  duty because they know that's the group who has the most constitutional
[29:02.080 --> 29:08.960]  information left in their brains if you're on a power trip you know believe
[29:08.960 --> 29:12.200]  the state's almighty and you know you're doing a good job so everybody better get
[29:12.200 --> 29:16.880]  out of your way you'll be just fine for a while but those of you believe they
[29:16.880 --> 29:20.600]  know who you are they're gonna come after you in a night of the long knives so
[29:20.600 --> 29:24.800]  when we come back I'll finish up with my take on what's happening in Morrissey
[29:24.800 --> 29:30.600]  it's with Morrissey and I was happening with the military over there that I mean
[29:30.600 --> 29:34.880]  it's on record the military says the West is funding basically an Al Qaeda
[29:34.880 --> 29:39.080]  takeover in Egypt and we're not gonna have jihadis running this country and
[29:39.080 --> 29:44.080]  so our criminal government is trying to tell the military to put Morrissey and
[29:44.080 --> 29:48.640]  Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood back in charge our government runs Al Qaeda
[29:48.640 --> 29:55.800]  period we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[33:30.600 --> 33:40.560]  that's right the death machine ain't slowing down that summer of rage by our
[33:40.560 --> 33:50.840]  good friend shooter Jennings the info were inspired that album and look at the
[33:50.840 --> 33:56.840]  cover of drudge Friday of rage is llamasist push back and it shows the
[33:56.840 --> 34:01.960]  shaved head a big bearded g hotties I'm not saying all Muslims that beards are
[34:01.960 --> 34:10.720]  bad my point is these are radical globalist jihadis that are openly killing
[34:10.720 --> 34:19.360]  Shiites and other alawight minority groups and burning down churches and
[34:19.360 --> 34:25.920]  attacking Christians in mass and the Egyptian military basically has its
[34:25.920 --> 34:31.960]  roots in Bathurst to understand this in Bathurst leaders so does Syria so does
[34:31.960 --> 34:37.000]  Iraq who said we want to build power plants we want to build dams we want to
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.640]  we want to have movie theaters we want our girls to go to college and not where
[34:41.640 --> 34:47.560]  burkas over their heads and there has been a fight for a hundred years a hundred
[34:47.560 --> 34:54.360]  years by Saudi Arabia and their corrupt regime with the globalist to put
[34:54.360 --> 34:59.240]  radical Islam in charge everywhere that's why if you're historically informed
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.600]  it's such a joke on 9-11 to say al-qaeda did this when criminal elements of our
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.280]  government created it the hijackers were trained at US bases newsweek associated
[35:09.280 --> 35:13.200]  press I don't know exactly what happened I just know there better be a real
[35:13.200 --> 35:16.960]  independent investigation there was definitely a stand down and they
[35:16.960 --> 35:20.440]  definitely use 9-11 to take our liberties don't you get it their
[35:20.440 --> 35:27.120]  criminal elements in the government who are using radical Islam to bring
[35:27.120 --> 35:34.160]  countries down and Adolf Hitler was elected president they have a president
[35:34.160 --> 35:41.840]  and a chancellor in Germany at that time in 1933 and then Kaiser Wilhelm got so
[35:41.840 --> 35:45.160]  sick and old and the coalition government was falling apart so Hitler then
[35:45.160 --> 35:51.160]  became furor chancellor and president at the same time or the leader then a few
[35:51.160 --> 35:54.880]  months later he fire bombed the Capitol blamed it on his political enemies
[35:54.880 --> 36:00.480]  drugged up a mentally ill person Marinus Vanderloob had a show trial and
[36:00.480 --> 36:06.600]  chopped his head off you know what does this have to do with Mohammed Morrissey
[36:06.600 --> 36:15.880]  Hitler was elected Obama was elected if you believe that the communists sat
[36:15.880 --> 36:20.200]  around and voted in committees and elected Mao
[36:20.920 --> 36:27.240]  Julius Caesar was given much of his powers before he became king by the
[36:27.240 --> 36:34.040]  Senate so people are saying and Obama saying and the media saying how dare the
[36:34.040 --> 36:40.640]  military of Egypt to pose Mohammed Morrissey who they quietly came to when
[36:40.640 --> 36:47.800]  14 million people were in the streets on Monday the biggest demonstration in
[36:47.800 --> 36:54.080]  world history 14 million in Cairo and it's now been released by the London
[36:54.080 --> 36:57.280]  Guardian by the military of Egypt saying here's what happened here's the
[36:57.280 --> 37:03.680]  timeline and Morrissey's confirmed that that is indeed the case they came to him
[37:03.680 --> 37:06.800]  on Monday they said you got to step down right now we can't control these
[37:06.800 --> 37:10.200]  people they're gonna overthrow everything the people say well the
[37:10.200 --> 37:13.880]  Egyptian military was trained in the US the Egyptian military you know they're
[37:13.880 --> 37:20.680]  not good the point is Morrissey was so bad the people already won you know when
[37:20.680 --> 37:25.440]  you've got thousands of people to every copper military in the streets it's over
[37:25.440 --> 37:28.960]  they would have burned the entire country down the ground so the military
[37:28.960 --> 37:32.240]  comes to him and says listen we're getting funded by the globalist we're
[37:32.240 --> 37:36.120]  doing what you say you know you're lighting Christians on fire I mean he
[37:36.120 --> 37:39.480]  would take them they're burning them in the streets they were crucifying them at
[37:39.480 --> 37:44.840]  the presidential palace there's film of this at imagine lined with Christians
[37:44.840 --> 37:50.480]  crucified this is our government supporting this and notice it's never on
[37:50.480 --> 37:57.160]  our news folks because it's not politically correct if a gay person gets
[37:57.160 --> 38:00.480]  punched in the nose in public it's a hate crime the person is arrested it's
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.640]  national news for six weeks we have footage an article going up right now
[38:05.640 --> 38:09.280]  of groups of gay people beating up Christians and the police doing nothing
[38:09.280 --> 38:14.120]  and the media spinning it like it was a brawl and again I'm not getting into
[38:14.120 --> 38:17.360]  some obsession over gay people I'm quite frankly I'm sick of hearing about it my
[38:17.360 --> 38:19.920]  point is it's the same deal you're beating up Christians you're burning
[38:19.920 --> 38:26.360]  Christians or Muslim minority groups that are nonviolent like Alawites that
[38:26.360 --> 38:33.800]  are a totally nonviolent group this is the type of out of control garbage that's
[38:33.800 --> 38:43.760]  happening right now and so that's what I'm getting at here is that Hitler was
[38:43.760 --> 38:48.400]  elected so just because Morris he was elected a year ago and then had a rain
[38:48.400 --> 38:54.800]  of terror cities under martial law surreal law being put in families that
[38:54.800 --> 38:58.280]  wanted their girls to go to college kicking them out of college slapping
[38:58.280 --> 39:04.160]  burkas on women's heads you know Muslims didn't even do that in the last
[39:04.160 --> 39:08.200]  couple hundred years and that's a Saudi Arabian thing rich women who had to go
[39:08.200 --> 39:12.720]  in the market who didn't want their skin burned it was upper class to
[39:12.720 --> 39:16.560]  have unblemished white skin because it meant you didn't work in the fields same
[39:16.560 --> 39:20.400]  thing in Europe where everybody was white like Swartz Schwarzenegger means
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.640]  black plowman just meant you were out in the field it was lower class to have a
[39:24.640 --> 39:29.040]  son you know be a redneck well it's the same thing in the Middle East women
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.880]  wore those as upper class and then sometimes really rich women would wear
[39:33.880 --> 39:37.520]  a full thing because they had to go through town you don't get to look at
[39:37.520 --> 39:43.280]  them then it became a style that they then basically is lamasized this is real
[39:43.280 --> 39:48.320]  reality you're hearing about right here if they had some ultra-rich you know
[39:48.320 --> 39:54.160]  woman being transported by ship to visit say her father and she's gonna go out on
[39:54.160 --> 39:57.040]  the deck of the ship she covers her face up because these people don't even get
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.440]  to look at her when she gets out at the palace she's wearing a crown everybody
[40:01.440 --> 40:04.200]  sees her face
[40:06.320 --> 40:10.880]  this is how they use style to control people going back thousands of years
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.120]  ago the intercourt would say you you're so royal you you can't walk we have to
[40:14.120 --> 40:19.400]  carry you let's bind your feet you're such a princess let's bind them that's
[40:19.400 --> 40:22.720]  where high heels shoes all of that comes from that's how they use style to
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.840]  control us and I'm gonna go to Paul Watson here in a moment I just want to
[40:27.840 --> 40:31.600]  give you background on all this so I'm not saying it's even a good thing the
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.840]  military deposed Mohammed Morrissey but from a geopolitical thing of what
[40:35.840 --> 40:39.880]  happened it is a devastating blow against the new world order and that's why
[40:39.880 --> 40:45.320]  the EU and the global crime syndicate and Obama are reeling with anger they
[40:45.320 --> 40:48.800]  are turning Al Qaeda loose which is part of their deal for Al Qaeda to take the
[40:48.800 --> 40:53.440]  blame for 9-11 to send in its double agents to be involved in that that that
[40:53.440 --> 40:57.800]  Saudi Arabia and the bin Laden's were given in one week after 9-11 a three
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.840]  billion dollar defense contracting deal just for basis of the Middle East look
[41:02.840 --> 41:08.600]  it up immediately three billion extra the car law group Bush senior was
[41:08.600 --> 41:13.160]  meeting with the bin Laden's in the morning 9-11 in DC at their table that
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.680]  was their deal to take the blame and all of that that's why Bandar Bush was on
[41:17.680 --> 41:22.320]  Larry King live that's his nickname the Saudi Arabian Prince the ambassador from
[41:22.320 --> 41:25.920]  Saudi Arabia the US a week after 9-11 and Larry King badmouth
[41:25.920 --> 41:30.440]  someone bin Laden and Bandar said do not talk of this great man this way
[41:30.440 --> 41:38.120]  disrespectfully and Larry King said I apologize you see because they knew that
[41:38.120 --> 41:42.520]  was gonna be broadcast in Saudi Arabia it's like no you don't talk of a man of
[41:42.520 --> 41:46.800]  great honor this way because he really already died of kidney failure
[41:46.800 --> 41:51.440]  right around that time and so it was he was all just a cutout and then their
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.720]  deal was you get everything we take out your enemy Iraq the Americans are so
[41:55.720 --> 42:00.480]  dumb you supply the reported hijackers 15 of them the funding to cover all this
[42:00.480 --> 42:05.200]  came out in the news we'll take out Iraq the bath is secular people to the
[42:05.200 --> 42:09.120]  north of you and we'll bring in your your your jihadis and we'll let you take
[42:09.120 --> 42:13.360]  over and then later we're gonna give you Syria we're gonna give you Libya we're
[42:13.360 --> 42:17.200]  gonna give you all of North Africa we're gonna give you Egypt we're gonna give
[42:17.200 --> 42:22.880]  you everything and even Wesley Clark admitted this in a speech he gave that
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.080]  that was the plan to invade six countries over there and turn it over to
[42:26.080 --> 42:33.600]  Saudi Arabia that's what they've done this is a real geopolitical fact you're
[42:33.600 --> 42:36.880]  hearing and this is why we're under such attack because we're just pointing out
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.560]  the emperors wearing no clothes the parable of the emperors new clothes if
[42:42.560 --> 42:46.960]  you haven't read it look it up it's online understand it I'm just pointing out
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.680]  what is admitted fact because I want liberty and freedom and they're using
[42:51.680 --> 42:55.880]  this fake al Qaeda threat to overthrow our country as well and it is a crime
[42:55.880 --> 42:59.920]  against humanity to overthrow Libya and put in jihadis who've killed over 40
[42:59.920 --> 43:05.080]  thousand innocent people on record with machetes and are killing the black
[43:05.080 --> 43:09.080]  Christians and black Africans Muslims that are in the area and are just
[43:09.080 --> 43:13.040]  absolutely tearing out the infrastructure of that place that's their
[43:13.040 --> 43:19.280]  job and now they're doing it in Syria and they're gonna do it everywhere this
[43:19.280 --> 43:23.040]  is unbelievable and so the military comes people are trying to say the
[43:23.040 --> 43:29.440]  military heroes standing up to the jihadist they don't have a choice the
[43:29.440 --> 43:33.920]  globalists want to wreck every country not just the Muslim countries not just
[43:33.920 --> 43:37.760]  Pakistan our government put tens of thousands of jihadis in there to bomb
[43:37.760 --> 43:41.120]  and blow stuff up and then our government goes in bombs innocent people to
[43:41.120 --> 43:44.480]  try to cause an overthrow of the Pakistani government that's come out on
[43:44.480 --> 43:46.680]  record
[43:50.120 --> 43:58.680]  that is the reality of what's going on here and so they didn't even have a
[43:58.680 --> 44:03.800]  choice 14 million people the government was going to fall the last biggest
[44:03.800 --> 44:11.400]  crowds were three million 14 million mainly secularist and where's the big
[44:11.400 --> 44:16.520]  liberal you know trendy atheist crowd they're supporting Obama folks they're
[44:16.520 --> 44:20.600]  supporting the jihadis because they'll do whatever they're told we go out on man
[44:20.600 --> 44:25.760]  on the street in California in Austin you name it we walk up to the trendy
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.480]  areas and we say take all the guns put all tea partyers in FEMA camps for
[44:30.480 --> 44:35.600]  Obama and they go yes do it because we said for Obama see because they're on
[44:35.600 --> 44:40.440]  the winning team they're with Obama he's got a peace prize Jack anybody seen
[44:40.440 --> 44:48.120]  lately he's part African he can't do any wrong this is the mindlessness when you
[44:48.120 --> 44:51.240]  watch MSNBC all they talk about is how smart liberals are and how dumb
[44:51.240 --> 44:54.480]  everybody else is folks that's because their viewers are the dumbest people on
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.760]  the earth and it's a cult of how smart they are when they can't even tie their
[44:59.760 --> 45:05.040]  shoelaces I was 30 feet away on the hiking bike bridge I just jog about a
[45:05.040 --> 45:09.000]  mile and a half I stopped I was gonna shoot a quick video which I did upload
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.560]  about the federalization of police with checkpoints all over the country now
[45:12.560 --> 45:18.720]  it's part of the integration of martial law and I look over I'm gonna tell the
[45:18.720 --> 45:23.360]  whole story later if I have time I look you know over and I see this woman about
[45:23.360 --> 45:29.960]  30 feet away saying something loud it sounds like shut up shut up your
[45:29.960 --> 45:33.760]  brainwashing I'm talking I'm not talking loud on the video you can see the
[45:33.760 --> 45:38.120]  video I shot then I turn it off I'm talking about in this voice right here
[45:38.120 --> 45:41.760]  on the hiking bike trail on the pedestrian bridge talking about
[45:41.760 --> 45:47.440]  checkpoints all over the country and I walk over and her husband are laughing
[45:47.440 --> 45:50.320]  at me and they obviously know who I am because I was down the bridge they
[45:50.320 --> 45:56.280]  couldn't have heard what I was even saying and they go yes shut up and I'm
[45:56.280 --> 46:00.840]  and I looked at and they look like government employees feds basically you
[46:00.840 --> 46:07.280]  like a 50 year old military type she looked like a socialist liberal type and
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.880]  I said well I mean what's brainwashing how'd you even hear what I was talking
[46:11.880 --> 46:19.560]  about I'm way over there she and the husband goes leave now and at that
[46:19.560 --> 46:24.160]  point I went I went whoa I've got a First Amendment I said I bet she can't
[46:24.160 --> 46:28.320]  even articulate why I'm a brainwasher come on have a debate with me I'm
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.160]  being very nice he starts getting up and he goes I told you to leave and I went
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.120]  alright buddy and I and I turned and put my hands so I was gonna let him hit me
[46:37.120 --> 46:43.960]  first and I was just gonna absolutely tear his well the point is is that is I
[46:43.960 --> 46:48.120]  turned and put my hands on the rail and I said you know I got a First Amendment
[46:48.120 --> 46:52.520]  because I gave him the chance to walk away and he goes fine we'll leave then
[46:52.520 --> 46:56.040]  she starts calling the police on me as I start shooting another video 50 yards
[46:56.040 --> 47:01.080]  away and you can see that video from that point I started recording again but
[47:01.080 --> 47:06.560]  the point is that's the enemy folks they saw Alex Jones there's no way they
[47:06.560 --> 47:11.400]  didn't just see sky with a camera sitting there shooting video 30 feet away and
[47:11.400 --> 47:15.160]  then you know get mad at them they saw me and they wanted to laugh and they
[47:15.160 --> 47:19.240]  wanted to diss me and they wanted to have me just get upset by it like they
[47:19.240 --> 47:24.120]  would and walk away fearfully they wanted to peck at me and just teach me
[47:24.120 --> 47:28.120]  that I'm their slave let me just finish the rest of story since I got to this
[47:28.120 --> 47:30.360]  and I'll finish up with what happened with Morrissey and then go to Paul
[47:30.360 --> 47:35.880]  Watson then I finished jogging because it's it's a mile and a half to there and
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.880]  about a mile and a half back to Barton Springs I get there go in go back to my

[48:14.320 --> 48:17.680]  all got their nails and they're rubbing on themselves and all feeling powerful
[48:17.680 --> 48:20.400]  they're part of the ruling class they're part of the government and they're
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.160]  looking at everyone and you know they're sitting with their visors and
[48:24.160 --> 48:28.840]  everything and feeling very confident and I look over and I go I'm some sitting
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.800]  two feet from that's where I put my towel out before they even got there and
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.560]  before I went swimming now I'm out I put my shirt on stuff and I look over and I
[48:38.560 --> 48:42.200]  go oh is that the NSA real nicely I knew what she do soon as I said I do she
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.160]  laugh at me but I did it as a psych warfare test for myself just a test
[48:46.160 --> 48:50.520]  myself I looked at her real nice I said oh is that the NSA data center and she
[48:50.520 --> 48:54.400]  looked back and they all look and they laugh and they go and they and she rubbed
[48:54.400 --> 49:00.760]  her legs when she did it the pleasure of being part of the system not gonna tell
[49:00.760 --> 49:06.760]  you that with her red lipstick all sexy America's eyes now she didn't say that
[49:06.760 --> 49:12.040]  she went not gonna tell you that and smacked her lips and the and the cops
[49:12.040 --> 49:16.200]  might even have been feds they kind of got her shoulders up a little bit out
[49:16.200 --> 49:20.720]  there and they were just this our country now you know he was just who and I
[49:20.720 --> 49:24.880]  looked at him with it and I'm more powerful in person I looked at him and
[49:24.880 --> 49:28.520]  I said you know deep down you're on the wrong side of history and everything
[49:28.520 --> 49:32.720]  you're doing is illegal and you know this country is going under and that
[49:32.720 --> 49:36.160]  tyranny's being empowered you're being told to walk around in an arrogant mode
[49:36.160 --> 49:40.880]  and I said when we get this country back all of you that have engaged in
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.480]  crimes are going to be brought to justice you understand that and they
[49:44.480 --> 49:51.080]  weren't laughing anymore I looked at those cops and I told him and man then I
[49:51.080 --> 49:55.840]  went and did the 4th of July deal we rented kayaks went out with hundreds of
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.160]  people the kayaks to watch the fireworks and I could just spot the
[50:00.160 --> 50:04.320]  imperious nature of cops and bureaucrats and I'd go hey you're a cop aren't you
[50:04.320 --> 50:08.200]  they gotta be like how do you know that oh Alex Jones and again I and I could
[50:08.200 --> 50:11.360]  tell I couldn't tell good cops who aren't on power trips because they're
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.200]  just normal people out there but I could tell the little boys little boys I

[54:08.160 --> 54:11.160]  would you stand up for true
[54:11.160 --> 54:14.160]  or would you turn away too
[54:14.160 --> 54:19.160]  and then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong
[54:19.160 --> 54:20.160]  would you stand tall
[54:20.160 --> 54:26.160]  I'm not going to sit here and watch the classical evolution or de-evolution
[54:26.160 --> 54:29.160]  into oppression
[54:29.160 --> 54:31.160]  without a fight
[54:31.160 --> 54:34.160]  anytime I see people strutting around acting powerful
[54:34.160 --> 54:36.160]  I'm going to confront them
[54:36.160 --> 54:39.160]  that includes groups of police
[54:39.160 --> 54:42.160]  I'm in other cities other places I see cops arrogantly standing around
[54:42.160 --> 54:47.160]  or acting weird to people or you know not getting out of the way for citizens
[54:47.160 --> 54:49.160]  when they're walking down the street or acting like thugs I go over and talk to them
[54:49.160 --> 54:51.160]  and go why are you acting so thuggish
[54:51.160 --> 54:54.160]  and if they want to go give me your license and stuff that's fine
[54:54.160 --> 54:56.160]  I'm going to get an earful from me
[54:56.160 --> 55:01.160]  and again I obsess on the police because you're where the rubber meets the road
[55:01.160 --> 55:05.160]  and as things get worse and worse it may come down to the police and military
[55:05.160 --> 55:09.160]  because people need leadership to take this country back if the globalists start
[55:09.160 --> 55:12.160]  offensive purges against us
[55:12.160 --> 55:14.160]  just like what's happening in Egypt
[55:14.160 --> 55:17.160]  let me tell you something folks 14 million people hit the streets it's over
[55:17.160 --> 55:19.160]  the government's coming down
[55:19.160 --> 55:23.160]  I don't want that because it's so destabilizing and destroys the infrastructure
[55:23.160 --> 55:25.160]  I want to have a revolution of the mind
[55:25.160 --> 55:30.160]  I want those police and feds on power trips to not drink sodium fluoride
[55:30.160 --> 55:32.160]  on record that's killing them
[55:32.160 --> 55:35.160]  I want them to know how deadly vaccines are on record
[55:35.160 --> 55:39.160]  and not just make jokes about it
[55:39.160 --> 55:44.160]  I was talking to somebody that works in the city yesterday and they were telling me how
[55:44.160 --> 55:47.160]  the city's just saying oh there's nothing wrong with smart meters
[55:47.160 --> 55:50.160]  and they don't watch what you do and they're not going to control you
[55:50.160 --> 55:53.160]  RF's not bad for you when all the studies show the opposite
[55:53.160 --> 55:56.160]  and they're in the news in Europe and the US saying
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.160]  the smart meters will turn off your power during peak consumption or monitor what you're doing
[56:01.160 --> 56:04.160]  they always said that
[56:04.160 --> 56:06.160]  this is bad where we're going
[56:06.160 --> 56:10.160]  and I know that I've been ranting on the subject and I said I'd get to media disinformation
[56:10.160 --> 56:13.160]  I'll have to cover this briefly later in the next hour
[56:13.160 --> 56:16.160]  more and more I see these articles
[56:16.160 --> 56:21.160]  where they will again come and twist what I've said
[56:21.160 --> 56:24.160]  to try to say I'm a liar and the system is doing this
[56:24.160 --> 56:27.160]  because they're scared and they want to discredit us
[56:27.160 --> 56:29.160]  it's not going to work
[56:29.160 --> 56:32.160]  now Paul Watson's going to be with us for the rest of the next hour
[56:32.160 --> 56:35.160]  then we'll have open phones for part of the third hour
[56:35.160 --> 56:39.160]  and then Max Kaiser's going to join us on huge news dealing with
[56:39.160 --> 56:43.160]  the bond market imploding or beginning to implode as he predicted
[56:43.160 --> 56:46.160]  have central bankers lost control could the bond bubble implode
[56:46.160 --> 56:48.160]  even if there is no wiretapping
[56:48.160 --> 56:50.160]  but I just want to say this to everybody very clearly here
[56:50.160 --> 56:52.160]  I need your support

[57:34.160 --> 57:37.160]  you've got a big raft of important news
[57:37.160 --> 57:39.160]  Hi Alex, good to be back
[57:39.160 --> 57:41.160]  we're going to talk about the homeland security drill
[57:41.160 --> 57:43.160]  across America yesterday
[57:43.160 --> 57:46.160]  where Americans celebrated their independence
[57:46.160 --> 57:49.160]  by submitting to random bag searches
[57:49.160 --> 57:52.160]  by pot-bellied TSA agents
[57:52.160 --> 57:54.160]  and the local news channel in LA said
[57:54.160 --> 57:57.160]  that people need to thank those TSA agents
[57:57.160 --> 58:00.160]  for their work in safeguarding America
[58:00.160 --> 58:02.160]  no, no, they actually give them medals
[58:02.160 --> 58:04.160]  combat medals
[58:04.160 --> 58:06.160]  well exactly
[58:06.160 --> 58:08.160]  you have to thank the overlords
[58:08.160 --> 58:10.160]  for imposing their tyranny upon you
[58:10.160 --> 58:12.160]  no, it's not enough just to obey anymore
[58:12.160 --> 58:14.160]  you've got to thank them for it
[58:14.160 --> 58:16.160]  in fact it's not enough to lick the boots now
[58:16.160 --> 58:18.160]  they're saying you're going to have to start
[58:18.160 --> 58:20.160]  kissing the rumpus
[58:20.160 --> 58:22.160]  maybe that should be the new salute
[58:22.160 --> 58:24.160]  see if you're a crap, they hang your behind out
[58:24.160 --> 58:26.160]  and you know you
[58:26.160 --> 58:29.160]  citizens could be bidets
[58:29.160 --> 58:32.160]  we'd have to volunteer, compulsory volunteerism
[58:32.160 --> 58:34.160]  one day a week to be at a government toilet area
[58:34.160 --> 58:36.160]  to act as a bidet
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.160]  we'll be right back, I think that's a good idea

[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:35.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have got a ton of news
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.160]  in the next two hours and a short time to get there
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.160]  Homeland Security conducts top secret July 4th drill
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.160]  and it's about federalizing police
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.160]  and the videos are pouring in of police
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.160]  military with police, TSA commanding
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.160]  highways, transportation hubs
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.160]  just searching everyone
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.160]  it's like flashbacks when I've been in Mexico
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.160]  at checkpoints we are certainly becoming land
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.160]  of the cowards home of the fluoride head slaves
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.160]  unfortunately so we're going to be breaking all that down
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.160]  should we celebrate the 4th of July in the aftermath of it
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.160]  as a memorial service that's how I felt yesterday
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.160]  also documents expose predator drones
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.160]  spying extensively in the US
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.160]  against US citizens
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.160]  not just on the border
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.160]  well of course we told you that so the media said
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.160]  that we were liars the last two years
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.160]  that there were no drones
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.160]  no FBI drones, no Homeland Security drones
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.160]  then it turns out they play games and go well
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.160]  it was Air Force drones or Army drones
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.160]  assigned and so that's why we didn't have any missions
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.160]  they had hundreds of missions per airport
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.160]  see how they play these lawyer games with people
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.160]  Alex Jones says two billion bullets
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.160]  it's only 244,000 one line item
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.160]  everybody goes man that guy's a liar
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.160]  yeah he's a big liar
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.160]  let me hit this now and then I'm going to go to Watson
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.160]  this is a very important little story here
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.160]  Alex Jones boasts his ratings destroy Rush Limbaugh
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.160]  people like this show more than his
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.160]  and this is out of media ight
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.160]  and again this isn't a very important story in and of itself
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.160]  I see these type of things daily and I'm not even looking for them
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.160]  so I'm sure there's a lot of it I don't see
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.160]  last week and you can go you heard the show
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.160]  or you can go pull it up they use a small clip
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.160]  I said that I have bought advertising on Rush Limbaugh
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.160]  not once but twice every time there's campaigns
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.160]  to kick him off the air and then I'm not in competition
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.160]  with Rush Limbaugh and that if they can take him off the air
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.160]  they can take all talk radio off the air
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.160]  and I said that we either hang together for the First Amendment
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.160]  even if we don't totally agree with somebody
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.160]  or we hang separate and everyone knows
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.160]  that I've had Michael Sabajohn and I promote a lot of the things
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.160]  that he does that I think are good and everybody knows
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.160]  I'm trying to not fight with people
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.160]  now when newsbusters got a hold of this
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.160]  and really shame on them
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.160]  because I link to some of their better stuff
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.160]  and I just want to get my country back
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.160]  I'm really trying to be just a good person here
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.160]  and I'm tired of the fake right wing
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.160]  and the fake libertarian people
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.160]  constantly attacking us
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:23.160]  and they show Talkers Magazine
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.160]  and what Talkers says is the Top 10 talk show host
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.160]  and then they show that I'm not in that
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.160]  even though I've been on the cover of Talkers
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.160]  and they say I'm the biggest show
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.160]  that is not in the main line conglomerate
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.160]  I've been on the cover back when they were still a paper publication
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.160]  and they say out of that I'm a liar
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.160]  when I was saying in places like Rochester
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.160]  or places like Abilene or places like Orlando
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.160]  on smaller stations that have literally no ratings
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.160]  I will beat Limbaugh within a year
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.160]  and I gave examples and then I said
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.160]  but it didn't matter then the station still changed formats
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.160]  being number one isn't enough
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.160]  so I said thank God we're on the internet
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.160]  and dominating there
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.160]  that turns into
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.160]  I want to bring Rush Limbaugh down
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.160]  and I'm a liar saying I have a bigger total audience than him
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.160]  let me give you the numbers
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.160]  Rush Limbaugh probably has five times the terrestrial radio audience I do
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.160]  probably more
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.160]  because he only has five times the stations
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.160]  most of them are the much bigger ones
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.160]  than these stations
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160]  I'm not about this
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.160]  it is so frustrating
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.160]  to see all this going on
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.160]  we're going to come back and go to Paul, Joseph, Watson
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.160]  it's just incredible how they spend all this stuff
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.160]  but on the internet if you go to the Alexa numbers
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.160]  we're thousands of percentage points above Limbaugh
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.160]  and that's just one of our sites
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.160]  we have dozens but I'm not in competition with Rush Limbaugh
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.160]  and this is a distortion, you're lying to your raiders
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.160]  it runs on battery power
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.160]  so even if the grid goes down you are protected
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.160]  it's completely customizable

[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.160]  you aren't always at home

[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.160]  but rather we have formulated our silver gel
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.160]  using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.160]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin

[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.160]  warrantless checkpoint, a random checkpoint
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.160]  you are pulling up to a group of highway men
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.160]  no different than stagecoach robbers
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.160]  they have just been brainwashed and conditioned it's okay
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.160]  but the supreme court, other courts have ruled it is the mark of Nazi Germany
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.160]  it is the mark of Mexico
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.160]  and the videos are pouring in
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.160]  articles up on infowars.com
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.160]  that are just incredible
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.160]  where the police are setting up these warrantless checkpoints
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.160]  and then they want to search people's cars
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.160]  and if you say no
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.160]  they begin yelling and screaming at you
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.160]  I guess kind of like a bank robber when they come in and say
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.160]  get on the ground or I'll blow your head off
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.160]  it's the same deal
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.160]  and it shows how far we've gone down the rattle
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.160]  America never did stuff like this before
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.160]  this kind of stuff never went on
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.160]  why is it okay now it's not okay
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.160]  and all over the nation
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.160]  with TSA, with military as well
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.160]  and with federalized police they had warrantless checkpoints
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.160]  on country roads, big highways, transport hubs
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.160]  you name it
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.160]  with the TSA
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160]  a nationwide operation
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.160]  and they're just going to incrementally ratchet it up until all of us
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.160]  live like they did in Boston
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.160]  there's a supreme court case going on
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.160]  dealing with the police now come and say
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.160]  we're walking down your whole neighborhood
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.160]  just leave indefinitely
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.160]  there's an infographic up on infowars.com
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.160]  infographic, NSA
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.160]  is a billion times more
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.160]  expansive
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.160]  than the Stasi
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.160]  that just got published
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.160]  hate crime, gays brutally beat Christians in America
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.160]  but I guess
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.160]  I guess you've got to
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.160]  why not execute all the Christians just to prove you're
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.160]  not a homophobe
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.160]  also West Virginia using seatbelt checkpoint
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.160]  to conduct illegal
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.160]  search and seizure
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.160]  Nevada police
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.160]  faced rare third amendment lawsuit
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.160]  for forced commandeering of homes
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.160]  cops locked down neighborhood after
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.160]  shots fired in the air on July 4th
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.160]  so you're all prisoners and we're coming in your house without warrants
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.160]  FSA, rebel, suicide bomber, vows to attack
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.160]  US and Europe, yeah why are there checkpoints everywhere looking for terrorists
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.160]  I mean the terrorists work for our government are all on duty
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.160]  being given hate-seeking missiles
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.160]  Al Qaeda can be trusted with that but I can
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.160]  I'm an evil, evil patriot
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.160]  God forbid I try to walk down the street with a gun
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.160]  by the way come up at the bottom of the hour
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.160]  Adam Kokesh did go to DC and did rack a shotgun
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.160]  on Pennsylvania Avenue and says he
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.160]  sent me a text saying I've just committed four felonies
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.160]  so he's had his Rosa Parks moment
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.160]  we're going to get him on the next few days
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.160]  next week or Sunday but we've got a clip of that coming up
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.160]  Jakari Jackson popping in
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.160]  Washington Post editorial board
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.160]  Goose steps to the
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.160]  beat of Obama's drum
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.160]  that's just some of what's on the site we're going to get to all of it
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.160]  but first Watson
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.160]  Paul Watson our newsman
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.160]  you've got a lot to cover from
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.160]  the government controlling your refrigerators
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.160]  with smart meters and mainstream news
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.160]  to the drill
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.160]  which again is martial law
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.160]  but then nothing happens and people just get conditioned
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.160]  to live under it
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.160]  it's martial law when they spy on us
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.160]  without warrants it's martial law
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.160]  when our military is under NATO command
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.160]  it's martial law
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.160]  when they strip search your kids without warrants at school
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.160]  we are just basting
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.160]  and the same thing in Europe in this tyranny
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.160]  Paul Watson editor of PrismPlanet.com
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.160]  Yeah this was a
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.160]  top secret
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.160]  they called it Homeland Security Drill
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.160]  which took place yesterday
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.160]  mainly focused in LA
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.160]  but also across the US
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.160]  and KTTV
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.160]  did a report on it and basically said
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.160]  that undercover police
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.160]  along with TSA and Homeland Security
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.160]  agents would be conducting
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.160]  both visible and
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.160]  undercover operations
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.160]  in the interest of safety
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.160]  because they feared a new attack
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.160]  in the aftermath of the Boston bombings
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.160]  because apparently those brothers said
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.160]  they wanted to attack New York on July 4th
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.160]  so basically they had
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.160]  a bunch of TSA Homeland Security
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.160]  Sheriff's Department police
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.160]  parading around subway stations
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.160]  different transport hubs across America
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.160]  conducting random bag searches
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.160]  Oh no no no public parks everywhere
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.160]  putting up signs and they search everybody
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.160]  we're all being trained
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.160]  we always knew it would move from the airports to the streets
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.160]  that was the plan
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.160]  Yeah so they had a bunch of goons basically
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.160]  walking around some of them undercover
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.160]  taking down Americans
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.160]  on the day they celebrate their independence from tyranny
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.160]  but what stood out for me
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.160]  is the news channels coverage
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.160]  of this because right from
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.160]  the start they admitted that
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.160]  they were working with the police
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.160]  to promote the drill
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.160]  so instead of asking actual hard questions
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.160]  about what taxpayer money was being
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.160]  wasted on
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.160]  they were actively promoting this pointless exercise
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.160]  Oh no no no this is the merger
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.160]  of the media with the state
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.160]  absolutely this is
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.160]  the point we've gotten to
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.160]  in this country in fact that clip is in the article
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.160]  that's still linked up on
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.160]  DrudgeReport.com
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.160]  and you can read the quotes from this
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.160]  news channel report
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.160]  it said the exercise is quote
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.160]  top secret and that's the way it should be
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.160]  only they need to know
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.160]  what the game plan is
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.160]  and again we're learning how to live in Fallujah
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.160]  everybody's secret police
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.160]  the cops are secret police and get to
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.160]  fantasize that they're James Bond
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.160]  and no one can know
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.160]  what police are doing under the feds
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.160]  and the media's involved
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.160]  and we all get to play secret agent
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.160]  meanwhile the government runs Al Qaeda
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.160]  on record and ran the Boston bombing
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.160]  yeah
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.160]  and it's all about as you said this secret agent
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.160]  activity you know
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.160]  public has no right to know what's going on
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.160]  but listen to this one what we need to know
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.160]  or rather to be reminded of is that the threat
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.160]  homegrown and imported
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.160]  are all too real and in one way
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.160]  we're all undercover agents
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160]  who need to be aware of our surroundings
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.160]  just like in East Germany
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.160]  you know
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.160]  but you don't trust
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.160]  the citizen only trust the government
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.160]  we've had our camera crews in downtown
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.160]  have men walk up in suits and go
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.160]  because they're asking you know
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.160]  doing reporter interviews
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.160]  women in business suits doing interviews
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.160]  and it's like I'm calling the police on you
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.160]  and then the cops show up
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.160]  and people in infregard
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.160]  actually think talking
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.160]  is illegal
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.160]  these people are monsters
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.160]  well that's the whole point
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.160]  they've been brainwashed with this need
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.160]  to protect us from terrorists
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.160]  when in fact
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.160]  if you go and read the actual academic studies
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.160]  out of Ohio State University
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160]  and others
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.160]  all of these things kill more Americans
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.160]  than terrorists every single year
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.160]  accident causing deer
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.160]  things drowning in bathtubs
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.160]  intestinal illnesses
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.160]  allergic reactions to peanuts
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160]  you know that Americans are
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160]  two to three times more likely to be killed
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.160]  by lightning strikes than by terrorists
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.160]  need a five by waiting period
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.160]  on lightning strikes let me show people this
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.160]  I actually have articles
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.160]  here in my stack where there were deaths
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.160]  all over the country
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.160]  with father runs over son on float
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.160]  fire department vehicle
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160]  turns over kills man
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.160]  officers obviously banned fire engines
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160]  and banned parades because if you know
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.160]  if you have people dying in these
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.160]  every time they have them we've got to ban them
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160]  exactly
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.160]  but they're protecting us from
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.160]  what Glenn Greenwald
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.160]  called the decades biggest scam
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.160]  which is a good article to go and read
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.160]  basically over the last 12 years
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.160]  Homeland Security has spent billions
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.160]  and billions on this
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160]  contrived war on terror
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.160]  when Americans are more likely to be killed
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.160]  by a litany of mundane things
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.160]  it's a giant hoax
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.160]  it's a giant takeover in plain view
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.160]  and listen
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.160]  I sit there with these feds and cops
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.160]  and they'll laugh at you not all of them
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.160]  a lot of them are listening now and I go
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.160]  you understand the government runs al-qaeda
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.160]  let me show you man oh no yeah right
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.160]  government runs al-qaeda they publicly run it
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.160]  I mean that's what's so insane about this
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.160]  that's the point I mean domestically
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.160]  the threat is not real
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.160]  you know even the New York Times
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.160]  FBI hatched all the
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.160]  major domestic terror plots over the last
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160]  10 years it's not real but they're
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.160]  trying their damnedest to make it real
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.160]  by provocaturing all the terrorists
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.160]  domestically and arming
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.160]  all the terrorists abroad
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.160]  in Syria, in Libya
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.160]  in Niger in all these other
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.160]  countries so they're trying their hardest
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.160]  to make it real meanwhile more
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.160]  Americans get killed by beastings
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.160]  but the Department of Homeland Security
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.160]  has to spend billions and billions
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.160]  protecting us from this threat
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.160]  I was reading where Bloomberg yesterday
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.160]  was defending his warrantless checkpoints
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.160]  but then playing race
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.160]  and he goes we stopped and searched
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.160]  700,000 whites
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.160]  and 300,000
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.160]  Hispanics and only half
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.160]  a million blacks in New York and it's like
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.160]  they randomly stop you
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.160]  search you it's totally illegal
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.160]  and then now
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.160]  that system is being segued
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.160]  and they stop you at these checkpoints
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.160]  and flip out when they can't
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.160]  search your car I mean they're
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.160]  illegally oppressing you
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.160]  in official oppression
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.160]  and they flip out when you act
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.160]  like you're still in America
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.160]  and then they use stuff like al-Qaeda
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.160]  the government runs it
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.160]  the government's been taken over
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.160]  I'm sorry what do you make of the moracy
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.160]  thing in the military not
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.160]  wanting to actually put al-Qaeda in charge
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160]  of Egypt
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160]  and the crucifying Christians
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.160]  at the presidential palace
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.160]  and imagine that's not even in our news
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.160]  Paul they're murdering burning down churches
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.160]  it's not in our news this is what our government
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.160]  does our government
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.160]  is raving demons
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.160]  I'm sorry go ahead
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.160]  Alex I'm baffled as to why
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.160]  Obama and David Cameron
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.160]  haven't immediately ordered
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.160]  the transfer of heavy weaponry
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.160]  to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.160]  to overthrow the Egyptian army
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.160]  you know maybe the Muslim
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.160]  Brotherhood should start chopping
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.160]  people's heads off eating people's hearts
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.160]  and attacking Christian churches
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.160]  because that seems to be how you
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.160]  get the Obama administration
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.160]  to give you weapons I guess
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.160]  the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt right now are not
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.160]  hardcore enough they need to
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.160]  start beheading people in order
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.160]  to get the Obama administration support again
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.160]  and they've already started
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.160]  attacking airports in Egypt
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.160]  today so I guess they're on the right
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160]  lines that that kind of impresses
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.160]  Washington and that's the way
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.160]  to get the job done so I'm just
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.160]  waiting for the Obama administration to say
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.160]  yeah we're going to give you heavy weaponry
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.160]  and go and have some fun go and try and overthrow
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.160]  the military of Egypt just as
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.160]  they're doing in Syria
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.160]  while at the same time these Syrian
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.160]  rebels say after we've
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.160]  finished in Syria we're going to Europe
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.160]  we're going to America we want
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.160]  to impose Sharia law we're going to kill
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.160]  all Jews and Christians
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.160]  and the Obama administration applauds
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.160]  and sends them weapons sends them money
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.160]  but then cops
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.160]  want to search me like I'm Al Qaeda
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.160]  exactly
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.160]  unbelievable what are we going to cover
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.160]  next when we come back Paul
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.160]  we're going to cover the EPA paying
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.160]  companies to put smart fridges in production
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.160]  which spy on and cut off your
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.160]  energy use and that's their own
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.160]  press release and
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.160]  they have new advertising
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.160]  beam to your brain
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.160]  Hello this is Ty Bollinger author of the best
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.160]  book cancer step outside the box
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.160]  I want you to know some very important
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.160]  information in 1985
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.160]  president Ronald Reagan requested
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.160]  that carnivora be sent directly to the
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.160]  White House at a time when only the
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.160]  president could obtain this world-class healer
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.160]  now 27 years later
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.160]  carnivore capsules are used around the

[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.160]  I saw this a few days ago
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.160]  I drink
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.160]  well actually I talked about it a few days ago
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.160]  LaCroix water
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.160]  even though I know it's bad to limit them cans
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.160]  it's so good like top of Chico
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160]  I just love mineral water
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160]  and it says bottled water on it
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160]  and it's been popular across the country for a decade
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.160]  and this woman
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.160]  this college student goes to the local grocery store
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.160]  buys cookie dough
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.160]  and LaCroix
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.160]  and walks out and they swat teamer
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.160]  but
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.160]  not even in uniform
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.160]  run up screaming yelling
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.160]  and then say roll down your windows
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.160]  she goes to turn the car on so she can do that
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.160]  then they pull guns out and say
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.160]  don't start your car
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.160]  and then they slammer around
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.160]  charger with assaulting them
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.160]  was all caught on surveillance tape
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.160]  doesn't matter you're slamming some woman's head in the ground
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.160]  you're a real slave
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.160]  and now it's all
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.160]  reportedly the prosecutor seen the video
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.160]  all of it it's all out there
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.160]  this is America folks
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.160]  I've seen hundreds of videos
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.160]  where you commit no crime
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.160]  but say hey
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.160]  why do you want to search me that's it
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.160]  you're gonna eat concrete
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.160]  normal street gangs can't do this
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.160]  I can carry a gun to protect myself from street gangs
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.160]  I can't do that to protect myself from police
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.160]  in Mexico or North Korea or in America
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.160]  and again our police are becoming
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.160]  like that because the system
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160]  wants this
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.160]  the globalist are criminals they've robbed
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.160]  the world they want a paramilitary force
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160]  in there to keep the people from taking
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.160]  the country back and if police don't
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160]  tell the line with the tyranny they are removed
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.160]  I want
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.160]  Paul Watson to get into the smart meters
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.160]  and the latest news that CNS news has been
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.160]  reporting on that
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.160]  but later we're gonna play the 911
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.160]  call
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.160]  okay as people witness this woman being grabbed
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.160]  slammed down and then charged
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.160]  charged with assault
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160]  okay Watson go ahead my friend
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160]  get into the other story
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.160]  well yeah just on that I mean there was also
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.160]  the guy who they shot his dog
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.160]  because he was filming police and we see
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.160]  incidents like that in America every day
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.160]  which is why I call it the fourth right
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.160]  you know I know things are bad
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.160]  in England and Europe with the surveillance
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.160]  and the police state but things like that
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.160]  happen here if they do it's very rare
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.160]  and I read about it in America
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.160]  every single day
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.160]  and it's it's it's shocking every
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.160]  time and it's why people are calling
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.160]  it the fourth right it's really heading
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.160]  that way because the police are just
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.160]  controlled completely out of control there's a
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.160]  lot of nice friendly police in America
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.160]  but some of them I don't know what it is
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.160]  whether it's steroids no no steroids
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.160]  they all watch UFC
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.160]  and a lot of them are criminals I mean like
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.160]  Serpico exposed the entire narcotics
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.160]  division thousands of men were
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.160]  all drug dealers and
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.160]  I'm telling you I mean that's what it is
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.160]  it's like goons
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.160]  and they think you and your family are in a cage
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.160]  match with them
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.160]  yeah we know they've been trained
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.160]  to treat the public as the enemy I mean
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.160]  that's come out in numerous documents again and again
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.160]  but it's still shocking every time
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.160]  but the EPA
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.160]  this was out of CNS news a couple
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.160]  of days ago the US Environmental Protection
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.160]  Agency has revised its energy
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.160]  star efficiency requirements
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.160]  for residential refrigerators
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.160]  and is encouraging the inclusion of connected
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.160]  features that respond
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.160]  to utility signals to curb their
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.160]  energy consumption
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.160]  what they're basically doing is paying the
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.160]  manufacturer
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.160]  refrigerators via tax rebates
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.160]  and saying if you
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.160]  include this switch which is
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:59.160]  optional for now which allows
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.160]  the power company to turn off
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.160]  people's fridges in times
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.160]  of heightened energy use then we'll
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.160]  give you kickbacks in terms of tax rebates
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.160]  so
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.160]  the fridges are going to be cheaper they're going to be
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.160]  available from next year and it's
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.160]  basically it's all to stop
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.160]  global warming there hasn't
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.160]  been any global warming for 14
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.160]  years but really what it is is the
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.160]  mainlining of the smart meter
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.160]  controlling your appliances which we told
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.160]  you 14 years ago was
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.160]  the plan and we're still attacked
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.160]  even when the CIA director admits
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.160]  it and says he's spying on you
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.160]  through your dishwasher and your refrigerator
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.160]  we're still bad Paul for being
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.160]  right and they're already in California
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.160]  turning people's
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.160]  air conditioners off
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.160]  that have gotten the rebate air conditioners this is
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.160]  the plan and it's just
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.160]  going forward
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.160]  it's the planed operas it's this
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.160]  whole idea they're moving towards having
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.160]  mega computers run by
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.160]  the state rationing your power
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.160]  all for the good of the earth of course
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.160]  none of it's going to apply to government
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.160]  or military but forget about that
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:05.160]  the government's still going to pursue all kinds of
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.160]  environmental horrors like GMO crops
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.160]  deforestation but then
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.160]  a day after that Obama comes out
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.160]  when he visits Africa and says

[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.160]  that everybody has mentioned here in Africa
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.160]  if everybody is raising living standards

[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.160]  will boil over

[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.160]  popping in with us
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.160]  what's really gotten
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.160]  to me is the way
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.160]  people that work for the government in
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.160]  security services
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.160]  are so arrogant and I've read history books
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.160]  about it I've studied it
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.160]  I've experienced some of it but they talk about
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:43.160]  in Eastern Europe under the Stozing
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:45.160]  and under the Soviets
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.160]  how arrogant bureaucrats were
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.160]  and how arrogant people were that would
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.160]  cattle on you to the bureaucrats
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.160]  get your wife or get your business
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.160]  or you look at the film
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.160]  the lives of others
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.160]  that's actually based on a true story
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.160]  or a composite of true stories
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.160]  about
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.160]  Stozing listening to lives that they were
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.160]  ruining
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.160]  surveilling people not just listening to their phones
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.160]  but reading their mail and oh
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.160]  the ultimate evil will never do that
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.160]  and how their own people started just
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.160]  leaking information because
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.160]  it was so horrible to sit there
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.160]  and know how evil the state was
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.160]  and see that's why they're so
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.160]  scared of leakers
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.160]  because it's not about the
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.160]  leaker leaking what's already known
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.160]  it's about the moral authority
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.160]  of their own people saying
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.160]  we're not going to be part of this
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.160]  people say oh what's wrong there was a military
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160]  coup against Morrissey who was elected
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.160]  I don't even believe he was elected folks
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.160]  the globalists are backing him he's committing
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.160]  horrible crimes against Muslim minorities
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.160]  and Christians on record
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.160]  the military has removed him
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.160]  and is saying we're not going to have Al Qaeda
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160]  and Muslim Brotherhood leaders that have been violent
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.160]  and have been persecuting people
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.160]  in a reign of terror we're arresting you
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.160]  and
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.160]  usually I'm not for the military
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.160]  removing someone I even saw Lou Rockwell
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.160]  who I really agree with usually somebody on his
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.160]  site saying you know it's wrong
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.160]  that the military did this
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:11.160]  well why are you agreeing with Obama
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.160]  I mean Hitler
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.160]  was elected and his military tried to get rid of him
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.160]  was Operation Valkyrie wrong
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.160]  I mean if somebody's
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.160]  elected does it mean they can throw people
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.160]  you know into
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.160]  furnaces and things
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.160]  no
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:29.160]  and I'm not saying we'll even be a good outcome out of this
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.160]  but clearly the globalists don't like
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.160]  what's happened clearly they don't like what's unfolded
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.160]  Paul Watson you're going to ride shotgun a little bit more
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.160]  with me to the next hour and take some calls
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.160]  ahead of Max Kaiser we're going to do some
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.160]  second amendment news here in just a moment
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.160]  but
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.160]  I mentioned this earlier but
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.160]  I want to mention it again
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.160]  and get your take on it
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.160]  because
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.160]  they had newsbusters I'm actually looking for the article
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160]  I had it here they had newsbusters
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.160]  oh yeah there it is no no that's another
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.160]  newsbusters article who we link to sometimes
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.160]  they do some good work occasionally you know
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:03.160]  it's exposing the left they'll actually report the news
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.160]  none of it's the so-called right wing
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.160]  oh here it is Alex Jones
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.160]  I will defeat Rush Limbaugh
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.160]  in the free market of ideas
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.160]  people like this show more than his
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.160]  now now now that's a quote
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.160]  out of context in there
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.160]  and my issue is I don't want to be like
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.160]  all the other talk show hosts that fight with each other
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.160]  and hate each other okay if they can bring down
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.160]  Limbaugh as they've tried to do
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.160]  they can bring down all of talk radio and there's major
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:29.160]  moves to do this
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.160]  and there's Bloomberg article saying I shouldn't be
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.160]  on XM you know there's
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:35.160]  White House controlled media matter saying
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.160]  I should be taking off the radio basically
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.160]  when they try to bring him down
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.160]  a couple years ago and again last year
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.160]  I went with Ted Anderson 50-50
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.160]  and bought a large amount of advertising
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.160]  okay a large amount
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.160]  because I believe
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.160]  plus I wanted to test it out and see how it did
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.160]  it kind of broke even
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.160]  I think it was overpriced it was like $4,000
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.160]  60 seconds so that was when it was discounted
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.160]  because folks had driven it down
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.160]  and we wanted to go see
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.160]  you know a
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.160]  if advertising on there would work
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.160]  it was okay
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.160]  but B
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.160]  and probably even more importantly
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.160]  we wanted to make a statement
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.160]  and that was what
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.160]  my rant was about last week and I said
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.160]  with mom and pop stations
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.160]  we've been able to beat him in the ratings many times
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.160]  and I gave examples so they put out a
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.160]  talkers magazine
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.160]  saying you know that I'm not beating
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.160]  Rush Limbaugh nationwide I never said that
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.160]  and then basically say I'm a liar
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.160]  even though I've been on the cover of talkers magazine
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.160]  breaking down that I have the largest
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.160]  the largest online audience
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.160]  the largest podcast
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.160]  I mean nobody out there has got 600,000 people a day
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:43.160]  downloading it like we do
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:45.160]  and it just goes on and on so
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.160]  my issue is
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160]  is that I'm sick of this distortion in fact
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.160]  if you guys type in talkers magazine Alex Jones
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.160]  and just click images you can see me on the cover
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.160]  of it a few years ago and then people can go find
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.160]  an article but my point is if you go to Alexa
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.160]  ratings
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.160]  and type in infowars.com
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.160]  versus rushlimbaugh.com
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.160]  there were thousands of thousands of places
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:07.160]  above him and that's just one
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.160]  of our sites now he's not mainly an internet guy
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.160]  I'm not in competition with Rush Limbaugh
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.160]  I had a caller
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:15.160]  call in and bash him and I said I don't really want
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.160]  to do that it's a distraction
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.160]  by the way I don't I'm not the one
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:21.160]  that wanted to be up against Rush Limbaugh
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:23.160]  this was the job offer
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.160]  I was given was in this time slot 15 years
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.160]  ago and again they'll probably take
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.160]  this out of context and say I'm attacking
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.160]  Rush Limbaugh because they want to get
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.160]  us fighting with each other and I'm not
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.160]  going to be part of it
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.160]  how they could take at news
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.160]  busters me saying
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.160]  we spent a bunch of money
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.160]  as a statement to try to
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.160]  keep Rush Limbaugh on the air because they can take him down
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.160]  they can take us all down
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.160]  instead of all the other talk show host attacking
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.160]  him and joining in on it hoping he got
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.160]  kicked off the ear so they get his affiliates
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.160]  that's not how I want to be
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.160]  number one I want to be number one in the realm
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:59.160]  of ideas which I've done
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.160]  up against him on stations in cities
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.160]  and I gave examples I did not
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.160]  say I was bigger than Rush Limbaugh
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.160]  on terrestrial radio and I'm sick
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.160]  of people lying to their viewers
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.160]  about it
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.160]  I mean man I'm sick of media matters
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.160]  in the White House I'm sick of Rachel Maddow
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.160]  I'm sick of you liars
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.160]  and to see news busters part of it makes me
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:21.160]  want to throw up
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.160]  excuse me
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.160]  man this isn't a game folks
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.160]  I'm going to say it one more time for everybody
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.160]  on record all of you know there have been
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.160]  thousands of declassified programs
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.160]  most of you know about center 15
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.160]  of them off top of your head of giving people
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.160]  lethal agents to kill them and a lot of
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.160]  times watch them die slowly including
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.160]  newborn babies foster children
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.160]  troops hey you all know about that
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.160]  you all know
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.160]  about them blowing up 200 plus chemical
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.160]  dumps and it raining down and telling the troops
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.160]  of the first Gulf War don't wear your gear
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.160]  so they can deny that they blown up the chemical weapons
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.160]  a death sentence for many of them thousands
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:01.160]  now you all know about that
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.160]  it was in the New York Times again two weeks ago
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.160]  now again is the government
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.160]  the bad guy or the good guy
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.160]  no one gotten trouble
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.160]  for testing in the 20s the 30s the 40s
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.160]  the 50s the 60s the 70s the 80s
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.160]  the 90s right through now
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.160]  because it's sanctioned by the robber barons
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.160]  that run our country
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.160]  no one gets in trouble ladies and gentlemen
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.160]  for microwaving foster children
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.160]  or putting them in radiation chambers
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.160]  or nerve-gassing US troops in project Shad
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.160]  or other programs
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.160]  like porting down in England
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.160]  nobody got in trouble for injecting
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:35.160]  black people for 40 something years with
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.160]  syphilis so they could spread it all over
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.160]  the United States and die slow horrible deaths
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.160]  nobody got in trouble
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.160]  how about some checkpoints to stop
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.160]  new world order people how about some
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.160]  investigations of what's in the vaccines no no
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.160]  it's all we're setting up the checkpoints
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.160]  for safety with a bunch of holier than
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.160]  now cops telling me I'm the terrorist
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.160]  and I'm sick of it
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.160]  I'm sick of it nobody's safe
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.160]  under the new world order nobody
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.160]  if this thing comes in
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:03.160]  you got that all you idiots that think
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.160]  you're part of the system part of the winning team
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.160]  you're not
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.160]  better get it through your head right now
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.160]  we better get serious and get focused
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.160]  or it's over
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.160]  all watching this is what happens when I take off
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.160]  two days I've been actually rampaging
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.160]  around Austin no but I mean it's all
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.160]  coming down it's all on record
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.160]  that every appliance will be remote controlled
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:25.160]  and spy on you first they do
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.160]  a kickback
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.160]  a
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.160]  what's the term they use when you get
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.160]  an air conditioner that does this and you get
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.160]  a discount on it to
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:37.160]  get the one they want
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:39.160]  rebate a rebate
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:41.160]  incentive and then they admit then it becomes
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.160]  mandatory where you won't be able to buy
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:45.160]  an appliance that doesn't track everything
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.160]  you're doing and the smart meter
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.160]  is an imperial probe droid on the
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.160]  side of your house sitting there watching
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.160]  you I'm sorry I got your courage action
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:55.160]  in here watching comments on this I didn't
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.160]  mean to get mad today
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.160]  on the previous thing
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:01.160]  media matters which is a white house operation
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:03.160]  routinely writes articles probably once
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.160]  every couple of months bitching
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:07.160]  and moaning about how drudge links
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:09.160]  to us which if you think about
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:11.160]  it is really pathetic for them
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.160]  to devote an entire article
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.160]  bitching about how another
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.160]  news site behaves and what decisions
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.160]  it makes but that's what the liberal
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.160]  authoritarians do it's always about how they
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.160]  set up there and dictate how everything's supposed
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.160]  to run and we're all supposed to just bow down
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.160]  and say yeah you're the boss I'll do whatever you
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.160]  say they think that's going to frighten
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.160]  drudge from linking to whoever
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:33.160]  the hell he wants and you know two years
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:35.160]  later you're still linking to us being on
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.160]  there every day for a week but hey
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.160]  but Randolph Lewis the
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.160]  UT professor of American
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.160]  studies came out three months ago and said
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.160]  Alex Jones is one of the most
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.160]  important political figures in America
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:49.160]  put you on the same level as Rand Paul
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.160]  so I guess that frightens them
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.160]  that's why they have to denigrate
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.160]  us and dismiss us and sideline
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.160]  us as much as possible. Oh yeah we have
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.160]  no listeners according to newsbusters
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.160]  and again I'm not mad
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.160]  because they did that I'm sad
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.160]  for them that is dishonorable
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.160]  that is deceptive
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.160]  that is wrong to take some edited
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:11.160]  thing and do that I mean that
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.160]  I'm sad for their humanity being
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.160]  lost because I want to defeat this thing
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.160]  and I'm so sick of my fellow Americans
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:19.160]  acting like a bunch of scum Paul
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.160]  I don't know why
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:23.160]  they're so afraid of us Alex I mean
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:25.160]  newsbusters they're supposed to be a
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.160]  conservative libertarian news outlet
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:29.160]  why are they wasting their time attacking us
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:31.160]  unless it's just jealousy
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.160]  makes no sense but we link
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:35.160]  to them when they do good stories and it's
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.160]  I just want people to be be honorable
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.160]  Jacari Jackson you got any comments on this
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.160]  I don't even want to get into the gun stuff but
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.160]  you're up here working on that no that's that ties into
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:45.160]  what I saw yesterday you know I went out to
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.160]  the rallies yesterday at the Capitol building
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.160]  and we had the
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160]  second amendment and also the fourth amendment rallies
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.160]  out there and it was just like you said
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.160]  there's a lot of infighting also talking to Rob
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.160]  do about that yesterday you know he said how
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.160]  the rally go and you know one guy would go
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.160]  up and then the next guy would talk about that guy
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:03.160]  the next guy would talk about that guy and
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:05.160]  and I'm like oh I thought we were
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.160]  wanted together under a common cause
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.160]  yeah after we defeat the New World Order
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:11.160]  and get the Bill of Rights back then we can fight
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.160]  with each other right I mean just give me a break
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.160]  man it's simple military
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.160]  common sense that we've
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:19.160]  got to stop fighting with each other
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.160]  yeah yeah I mean because the the elites
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.160]  they have their stuff together at least you know
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.160]  to a point where they can be effective but you know
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.160]  us we just have to we have to fight
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.160]  with this guy because we don't like his stage on
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.160]  there on this or that and it's always
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.160]  something ongoing it's always something new
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.160]  unbelievable I'm going to continue with
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.160]  Watson in the next hour but Watson
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.160]  I want to get your take in the next segment
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:41.160]  on these video clips right now let's go to this
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.160]  first one this is Adam Kochash
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.160]  went down on Pennsylvania
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.160]  Avenue and loaded
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:49.160]  a 12 gauge shotgun
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.160]  which in his own words was four felonies
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:53.160]  he sent me a text to this yesterday morning
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.160]  right after he uploaded it
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.160]  on July 4th and
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.160]  we're going to play that video and my
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.160]  whole issue is the Supreme Court overthrew
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.160]  the law banning that
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.160]  so he's trying to create kind of a Rosa Parks
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.160]  type case out of this obviously
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.160]  and the fact that this is such a
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.160]  incredible move of bravery in America
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.160]  to go and load a shotgun on
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.160]  Pennsylvania Avenue near the emperor
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.160]  just shows how enslaved
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.160]  we've gotten
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:21.160]  when just 20 years ago 30 years ago or so
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:23.160]  people you know had guns everywhere
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.160]  openly in this country including the
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:27.160]  district of criminals so we'll go to that clip
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.160]  and then go to your report from the Capitol here's Adam Kochash
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:31.160]  we will not be silent
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.160]  we will not obey
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.160]  we will not
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.160]  allow our government
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.160]  to destroy our humanity
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:43.160]  we are
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.160]  the final
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:49.160]  American Revolution
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.160]  see you next Independence Day
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:53.160]  well you've got to
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:55.160]  hand it to him they'll definitely come after him for that
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.160]  jacari yeah
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.160]  and that's I'm actually glad to see that
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.160]  video because when I went out to the rally yesterday
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:03.160]  you know there's a lot of confusion whether or not he was
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.160]  actually going to go through with that you know and even at the time
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.160]  I was out there you know what people were
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:09.160]  confused not sure if he was going to do and ask some people like
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:11.160]  yeah I'm not sure why Adam backed out
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.160]  of that but you know see that clip shows
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.160]  that he had nothing else he followed through
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.160]  but the issue is
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:19.160]  now tell us in this next clip
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.160]  exactly what went on
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.160]  because it's not illegal to have
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:25.160]  loaded rifles walking down the street
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.160]  in Texas but they arrest people everywhere for it
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.160]  tell us what happened
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.160]  with this armed march on the Texas Capitol
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.160]  okay so I got to the Texas Capitol
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:35.160]  yesterday and I interviewed a few people
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.160]  before the march I got there a little bit before
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.160]  and I encountered one guy which you're
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.160]  going to see in the video coming up
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:43.160]  I spun around because I was actually interviewing
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:45.160]  somebody else out of break off my interview to go look at this guy
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.160]  because the cops were around and I run up to the guy
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.160]  I say what were the cops talking to you about
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.160]  they said oh they asked me to take the magazine
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:53.160]  out of my rifle
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.160]  and I was like well was your rifle
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:57.160]  loaded did you have anything in the magazine
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.160]  so no I just had a unloaded magazine
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:01.160]  in my rifle but nothing in the chamber
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.160]  hey guys mute Watson you can
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.160]  hear him typing in the background it's kind of a cool noise
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:07.160]  he hammers those keys but
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.160]  we're gonna go back to Watson after the break
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.160]  you may have changed the outcome
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.160]  of that you may have changed
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:15.160]  the outcome by going over there with your camera
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.160]  yeah and I turned around to talk to the cops
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:19.160]  they were gone I didn't see those cops for the rest of the day
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.160]  you know I've tried to
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.160]  be friendly with the state police down there in the past
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.160]  they were very very friendly but whatever's going on
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:27.160]  down there now they even try to tell
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:29.160]  our camera people they can't film sometimes
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.160]  when they're by themselves intimidation wise
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.160]  and I just don't get you like become
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.160]  a cop and go let me see how I can intimidate
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.160]  people out of their rights
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:39.160]  the last time I was down there
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:41.160]  we had a different rally and I saw Mike Cargill
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:43.160]  down there and I stood up on the bench
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.160]  to get a different camera and get a higher camera
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.160]  angle and one of the cops going to tell me
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.160]  you can't stand on the bench
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.160]  in the United States
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.160]  yeah but with Aaron Dykes he's just down there
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.160]  covering a press conference and the cop comes over
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:57.160]  all mad and goes give me your info stop filming
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:59.160]  and there's Aaron with a tripod
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.160]  and a camera in a suit
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:03.160]  and Aaron's like why are you bowing up to me
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.160]  it's like those Federal Reserve
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.160]  security guards 500 yards from their thing
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.160]  with their guns saying leave now
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.160]  I mean it just comes down to okay Cargill
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.160]  I got a gun I'm in charge
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.160]  pretty much that's what tyranny is
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:17.160]  I got a gun I'm taking over
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.160]  yeah yeah that's what we saw but
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:21.160]  you know to their credit APD was pretty
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:23.160]  well behaved out there yesterday
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:25.160]  it was the brown shirts
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:27.160]  who were giving people problems
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.160]  okay so I got that wrong in the first hour
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.160]  as I was going from memory
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.160]  as I was washed down I was half awake today
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:35.160]  just to be clear then
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:37.160]  it was the APD didn't violate your constitutional
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.160]  rights it was the state police
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.160]  unbelievable unbelievable
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.160]  well we're going to skip this network break
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.160]  so we can play this clip here
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.160]  for everybody and again this is your
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:49.160]  before, during and after
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.160]  coverage of the armed march on the Texas Capitol
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:53.160]  right
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.160]  alright here it is
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.160]  again images of people marching
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.160]  Jakari how many would you say were there
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.160]  it looks like a lot
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:05.160]  I'll say at least 500
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:07.160]  and you'll see this is a time match
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:09.160]  you'll see more people
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.160]  Austin citizen
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.160]  student at the University of Texas
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:15.160]  state of a broad start with the V-Device
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.160]  and the combat infantryman's badge while in Iraq
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:19.160]  I want to talk about what's going on
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:21.160]  in our country today and one of the things
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.160]  that no one is even aware of it seems to me
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:25.160]  is the farm bill that's in the House of Representatives
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.160]  that's about to be passed
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:29.160]  does anyone realize
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.160]  that
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.160]  we're about to sign up for nearly a trillion dollars
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.160]  of expenditures over the next 10 years
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.160]  Prays up! Shut it down!
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:39.160]  Prays up! Shut it down!
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:41.160]  Prays up! Shut it down!
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:43.160]  and all this came out of co-cast
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:45.160]  just having an idea
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.160]  see that shows the power of the individual
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.160]  Freedom it brings a bigger message
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:51.160]  if we wear this mask
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.160]  like a million dollars come and wear this mask
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:55.160]  it brings a bigger message
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:59.160]  this is the real American people
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:01.160]  oh yeah you'll see some trendy's here in a second
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:05.160]  Trendy's were there in England
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.160]  they were standing on the side of the street
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.160]  I'll see them in just one second
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:13.160]  We're out here to protest, to tear the government,
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:16.160]  to break down a policy in which way the First Amendment,
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.160]  Second Amendment, all the way down to 10th.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:19.160]  One of me do!
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.160]  Stand up, my back!
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.160]  A privacy wretch or under attack!
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.160]  One of me do!
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.160]  Stand up, my back!
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:25.160]  Privacy wretch, under attack!
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:26.160]  Okay, there's the guy.
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.160]  I can question about the police.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.160]  You're not asking me.
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.160]  Just stay right here.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:35.160]  Oh, um, he asked me to not have a magazine in my firearm
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:40.160]  in order to, you know, not cause any tension.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.160]  I respected that.
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:43.160]  What about him having bullets at his guys?
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:45.160]  Yeah, this guy's a veteran.
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:48.160]  The state is more dangerous than bullets than us.
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.160]  Negative, sir.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:52.160]  It was a loaded magazine, but there wasn't enough though
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.160]  around in the chamber.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.160]  You see the trendies on the sidelines.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.160]  They don't know what to do.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:02.160]  They just want to take the vaccines and roll over and die.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:05.160]  It's basically supporting different solutions.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:08.160]  I believe, I think we all believe that this Fourth of July
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:12.160]  is not a time to celebrate American freedoms,
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.160]  but to re-establish them.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:17.160]  Okay, here come some more trendies.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:19.160]  They just don't know what to do.
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:21.160]  Seeing slaves with guns?
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.160]  Yeah.
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:23.160]  Cause they see a cop with a gun, they feel good.
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.160]  Yeah.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.160]  And they see a slave with a gun.
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:27.160]  I'm not sure if it's only going to get worse.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:30.160]  So I think we've got to take a stand now for something
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.160]  more drastic has to happen.
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:34.160]  I think this is a peaceful revolution today.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.160]  And 14th.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:37.160]  14th.
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:38.160]  Yeah.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.160]  Okay, so what motivates you today?
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:44.160]  Now, what do we want Fourth Amendment?
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.160]  What do we want now?
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.160]  What do we want Fourth Amendment?
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.160]  What do we want now?
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:51.160]  What do we want Fourth Amendment?
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:52.160]  Yeah.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:53.160]  That's pretty sexy right there.
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:54.160]  And I'll tell you, Alex, I know you're wondering.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:56.160]  I have a release for that kid.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:58.160]  I talked to his dad and I got his dad on camera.
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.160]  Oh, I know who he is.
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:01.160]  See, I'm the editor in boss around here.
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.160]  So then the news guys are like, by the way, I got a release.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.160]  That's great.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.160]  I guess it was so loud with some of the audio.
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:06.160]  Let's just critique it now.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:07.160]  Great.
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:09.160]  You know, you get an A plus for effort and a plus for all the
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.160]  great work all by yourself.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:11.160]  Jikari.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:13.160]  So great job as a one man team down there.
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:15.160]  But expanding on that, it sounds like with the mic is the
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:18.160]  shotgun and the cordial aid open.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.160]  We had a little audio difficulty.
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:23.160]  Like I got the first guy had a real good audio doing the
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:24.160]  handheld mic.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:27.160]  The other people had to pull them off the off the shotgun.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:28.160]  Doesn't matter.
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:29.160]  You did a great job.
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.160]  That is a great report.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:33.160]  Jikari Jackson working on the fourth that you lie, which you
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:34.160]  should be doing.
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:37.160]  You know, I ended up running around just crazed downtown
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:39.160]  waking people up against the New York Warriors.
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:42.160]  I heard a couple of those videos.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:44.160]  Something came over yesterday.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.160]  Okay.
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.160]  Now.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:48.160]  So you're on the bridge and you're doing a report and
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:50.160]  somebody is screaming at you to shut up.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:54.160]  But then later, I actually in the first video on the bridge,
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.160]  you'll actually see her and her husband.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.160]  They say 30 feet.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:58.160]  It's more like 50 feet.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:00.160]  They're way down on this bench.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.160]  I hadn't even been on that end yet.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:02.160]  Right.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:03.160]  I wasn't talking loud.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.160]  I was like, and here we are at the bridge, blah, blah, blah.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:07.160]  And even a lower voice and I do on air.
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:10.160]  And I'm talking about how they're federalizing police all
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:12.160]  over the country and how this is just conditioning for
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:14.160]  incremental martial law.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:17.160]  And on the video, because then again, I quit shooting for
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:19.160]  radio listeners to describe it.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:21.160]  And this way of walking across the bridge and finish my
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:22.160]  job.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.160]  And that's when they said something to me.
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:25.160]  But upon reviewing it, there's no way she could even
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:26.160]  hear me.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:27.160]  Yeah.
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.160]  So they just saw you.
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:29.160]  They were watching me.
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:31.160]  You could see them on the video watching me from the
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:34.160]  bench because they were turned facing the other way, but
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:35.160]  they turned around.
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.160]  So they're turned around looking over the back of the
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:38.160]  bench at me.
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:40.160]  And then I'm walking by him and she goes, Jesus, shut up
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.160]  your brainwashing.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:43.160]  And I went, excuse me.
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:44.160]  She goes, you heard me.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:46.160]  You're full of a bunch of brainwashing.
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.160]  You know, the paraphrase, I think that's almost exactly
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:50.160]  it.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:51.160]  And then I went, excuse me.
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:53.160]  What am I brainwashing about?
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:56.160]  And her husband goes, get out of here.
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:59.160]  So it's like, they're going to talk to me and then I'm
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.160]  not to respond.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:01.160]  And I started assessing them.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.160]  They were both government workers.
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:03.160]  Yeah.
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:05.160]  I mean, I could tell probably both former military, but
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:06.160]  like socialist type.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.160]  And I was just like, why are you saying I'm brainwashing?
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.160]  And I was thinking, I didn't film these people.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:14.160]  I hadn't even gotten to these people yet.
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:15.160]  Why are they?
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:16.160]  And they started laughing at me.
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.160]  And there was some other guy with him.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:20.160]  He was laughing and he was videotaping too.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:23.160]  And he said, I told you, he starts getting them.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:25.160]  He goes, I told you, get out of here.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.160]  Oh, they were blowing up.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:29.160]  And I just went, I'm not going anywhere, buddy.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.160]  I got a first amendment.
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.160]  So she started calling the cops on me.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:34.160]  It looked like, so I started walking away after they started
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.160]  walking away.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:38.160]  And then some park rangers came by who were listeners.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:41.160]  And by then I was taping again in case they came and started
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:42.160]  something.
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.160]  They started walking away and then it's all dog psychology.
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.160]  As soon as I turned, then they came back.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.160]  Just like if dog runs up on you and you yell at it.
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:51.160]  And then turn to walk away, it comes again.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.160]  I'm telling you, people act like animals, man.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:56.160]  I have never seen cops as well.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.160]  You stand your ground, they back off.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.160]  As soon as you turn away, it's over.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.160]  Tays are in the back.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:02.160]  And I don't understand it.
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:06.160]  I mean, are we literally the equivalent of like pit bulls or
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:07.160]  something?
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.160]  I mean, is that how humans act?
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:09.160]  I don't know.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:11.160]  I mean, just when we were doing the march yesterday and I
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:13.160]  couldn't believe how many people were just standing on the
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:17.160]  sidelines dump founded, like they're watching some type of live
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.160]  action documentary.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:21.160]  Oh, there's people walking in the, in the street.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.160]  I'm like, yeah, you can come and join us, but they didn't want
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:25.160]  to put down their lattes and carrot sticks or whatever else they
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:27.160]  were eating on the 4th of July.
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:30.160]  It was a, it was a, it was good overall.
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:35.160]  Well, I want to salute the, man, that crowd looked like 800
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.160]  people to me.
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:37.160]  I mean, do you say over 500?
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:39.160]  It is well over 500.
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:41.160]  I don't know the exact estimates and actually I had to do some
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.160]  creative editing.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:44.160]  There was a topless girl in there.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.160]  I had to try to do my best to cut out.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.160]  I don't think she made it.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:49.160]  I'm pretty sure she's not enough.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.160]  So you had to cut out a lot of the marches.
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:52.160]  Yeah.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:53.160]  Cause he was not always in the shot.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:56.160]  So I had to cut a lot of it out, but by and large, I think,
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.160]  you got a good idea.
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:56:59.160]  You know, I heard a conspiracy theory.
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.160]  I heard those used to feed babies.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:05.160]  Well, now it's 75% corn syrup in the brains are tiny.
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:06.160]  That's probably,
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:08.160]  you believe there are conspiracy theorists say that there used
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  to be things called families and dads and mothers.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.160]  And they used to feed babies with us.
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.160]  It always makes me laugh when you, when a colleague calls up
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.160]  and you're like, you were, uh, you weren't breastfed.
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:18.160]  Were you?
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:19.160]  And they're like, how'd you know?
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:22.160]  And it's just, I just never even, I never even asked my mother
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.160]  if I was breastfed.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.160]  It never.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.160]  I think you were probably breastfed.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.160]  I probably was, but it's just never occurred in my mind.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.160]  You need to give her a call.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:30.160]  Yeah.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.160]  Hey, it's hard work for the women, but it's important.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.160]  You know, it's designed for us because it actually comes from
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:36.160]  our mother with our genetics.
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:39.160]  It has all the vaccines of every woman before all the way back
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:40.160]  to the mitochondrial DNA.
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:41.160]  Did you know that?
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:42.160]  No.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:44.160]  That's why cutting breastfeeding off is, is never before
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:46.160]  happened until the last few hundred years.
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:48.160]  Every once in a while, a baby couldn't take their mother's milk
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.160]  because of whatever reason.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:51.160]  You gave them a jackass as milk was the best.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.160]  Reportedly all the world donkeys have the best milk for babies.
[01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:56.160]  Uh, but there's all sorts of other stuff, but no.
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.160]  Uh, it is a crime against humanity.
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:00.160]  I, you know, it really hit me.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:02.160]  All of this is a crime against humanity.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.160]  The GMO with pesticides that grow in the corn.
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:05.160]  Right.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:08.160]  Uh, the wheat, all of it, the new world order, all of this is
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:12.160]  a bunch of crazy people who get off on screwing everything up.
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:13.160]  Exactly.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.160]  You're such an extremist.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:16.160]  I am pretty extreme.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:18.160]  I like freedom on the fourth of July and, you know,
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.160]  I don't want to be told I can't have my sparklers or whatever
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.160]  else I choose.
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:23.160]  Because you might be a terrorist.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:24.160]  Yeah.
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:25.160]  Everybody could be a terrorist, but the government,
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:27.160]  and then lo and behold, you look at the government,
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:29.160]  they're the ones running the terrorist.
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:30.160]  What, what'd you think?
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:33.160]  We just, golly, golly, sergeant.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:35.160]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:36.160]  Thanks, Jakari.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:37.160]  That video's up on infowords.com, right?
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:38.160]  Yes, yes.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:45.160]  All right, it's up there.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:24.160]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:28.160]  And you will love the way real soap makes your skin feel.
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:34.160]  Call 1-800-340-7091 or visit www.5starsoap.com.
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:39.160]  Alex and his staff have used these earth-friendly pure soaps for years.
[01:59:39.160 --> 02:00:05.160]  See them on the web www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:10.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:11.160]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:13.160]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:17.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:26.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:31.160]  Well, we got a hate crime video up on infowords.com.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:36.160]  Gays brutally beat Christians in America.
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:45.160]  And you've got a gang of gays.
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:47.160]  And it's not that I'm mind-calling them gays.
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:49.160]  I have to use the term everybody orders me to use.
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:51.160]  It's all brainwashing.
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.160]  I mean, you would call it heterosexuals.
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.160]  What would you call it?
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.160]  Straits.
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:59.160]  Imagine if a group of straits beat up some gay people.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:04.160]  It would be national news everywhere, as it now is.
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:06.160]  And I think that's wrong when people do that.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:14.160]  This is a giant horde of people beating up Christians that came out to stand on the street corner and exercise their first amendment.
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:20.160]  And, you know, the fact that this doesn't get any attention.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:23.160]  I mean, it's just like groups of blacks attacking whites all over the country.
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:28.160]  It needs to get attention to say it's wrong so people don't morally think it's okay.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.160]  Just like the Ku Klux Klan used to go around beating blacks up and worse because they thought it was morally okay.
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:38.160]  I just cannot stand the double standards.
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:40.160]  I was watching this video during the break.
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.160]  It just blew me away.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.160]  That video is up on infowars.com.
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:49.160]  Watson, I'm going to keep you with us another 30 minutes or so here and take some phone calls.
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:59.160]  People want to join us on air, first-time callers, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:01.160]  And again, we're showing this video.
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:08.160]  It starts with just, you know, kind of some in pecking and pushing and then turns into just a melee of trendies beating people up.
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:10.160]  And I tell you what, man, you do that to me.
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:13.160]  You're going to get your nose taken off very quickly.
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.160]  I'm just so sick of wimps, like thinking they can push everybody around.
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:23.160]  Like that guy yesterday, he like gets up and he goes, I told you get out of here.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:26.160]  And I'm like, I'm being polite to the guy before that.
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.160]  I'm like, I'm not going anywhere.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:33.160]  I'm just so sick of weirdos thinking it's their right to attack people.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:36.160]  I don't care who they are.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:37.160]  Let's go back to Paul Watson.
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:39.160]  This is a short segment, Watson.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:41.160]  What do you make of the general craziness in your gut?
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:45.160]  Where do you think everything's going, Watson?
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:52.160]  I think it's going towards the complete collapse of society, but on a very slow motion process.
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:59.160]  I mean, the thing you're talking about on info was collectivists and liberals will preach tolerance all day,
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:04.160]  but they won't tolerate people's free speech if they disagree with it.
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:08.160]  It's like those two bloggers who've tried to get into the UK to speak at a rally.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:16.160]  They were critical of extremist Islam and the home secretary said, no, thanks are going to deport you.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:17.160]  They didn't get in the country.
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:25.160]  And while at the same time, extremist Islam preachers who call for killing all Jews and Christians are allowed into the country,
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:27.160]  allowed to preach at mosques on a regular basis.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:29.160]  And have TV shows.
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.160]  While I was there, I saw it on TV.
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:33.160]  Right.
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:38.160]  So it's about, oh, we tolerate free speech. Everybody's going to be inclusive.
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:44.160]  But don't criticize minorities, even if they're extremists and even if their behavior deserves.
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:45.160]  Even if they're racist.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:46.160]  Absolutely.
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.160]  Here's the deal.
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:52.160]  The globalists are a lot of different combines together run by central banks,
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:57.160]  but it is a leftist anti-Christian, anti-family group of kind of Jacobins.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.160]  They tried this in the French Revolution to end the family, changed the week to nine days.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:06.160]  They want to play God and they want to pull down existing things, existing structures.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:08.160]  And they really are.
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.160]  The globalists will team up with anybody as long as it hurts families and Christians.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:15.160]  I mean, there is a bias against families and Christians.
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:19.160]  They, I mean, we know when the globalists get control, they come after us.
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:21.160]  It's that simple.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:25.160]  I mean, Christians all over the world, it's not just a cultural war in the West.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:30.160]  All over the world, Christians are being expunged, being ethnically cleansed.
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:32.160]  And nobody's really talking about it.
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:34.160]  It's happening all across the Middle East.
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:36.160]  Christians are under direct assault.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:40.160]  And nobody seems to be that concerned about it because they're not on my list.
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:44.160]  I mean, so what if they take a family out and chop their heads off on the roof screaming Allah Akbar?
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:46.160]  I mean, Obama got a peace prize.
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:48.160]  You're racist.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:50.160]  Why are you racist against Obama?
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.160]  Apologize to media matters listening right now.
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:55.160]  How dare you not want to be head children?
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:57.160]  How dare you not want to eat people's hearts?
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:00.160]  Al Qaeda and Obama are good.
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:29.160]  It's completely customizable.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:34.160]  So you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit or shed.

[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:06.160]  tyranny is here.
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.160]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.160]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:18.160]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:22.160]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cams.
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.160]  Now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:30.160]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:34.160]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:39.160]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:45.160]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:48.160]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:50.160]  The police state isn't coming.

[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:24.160]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:34.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into hour number three.
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:37.160]  We're going to take some phone calls here with Paul Watson.
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:42.160]  Ahead of Max Kaiser joining us with big financial news at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:45.160]  I might have to do an hour overdrive. There's so much news.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:48.160]  Man, I take two days off and I feel energized.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:51.160]  I'm ready to go do the nightly news, everything.
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:57.160]  But we are back and I'll be back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:01.160]  Listening to the 911 call of this poor woman.
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:05.160]  We covered this a few days ago, but now it's big national news.
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:07.160]  The time dispatch is covering it.
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:15.160]  Where she went for a benefit to get some cookie dough and bottled water.
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:20.160]  And the undercover liquor police come running out screaming and yelling.
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:25.160]  And her and her friend thought that they were being attacked.
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:27.160]  And so they begin to drive off.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:31.160]  Then the police swarm them, pull them over and then say, roll your window down.
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:34.160]  So they go to start the car again. They point guns at them, pull them out of the vehicle,
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:37.160]  slam to the ground and then charge them with three felonies.
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:42.160]  And folks, this is what's so scary. This is happening all over the place.
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:48.160]  We've got videos up on info wars.com of checkpoints from California to West Virginia,
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:50.160]  where you drive up to one.
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:53.160]  They got dogs and lights and everything and they want to search your car.
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:58.160]  And if you say no, man, they start screaming, jerk you out of the car, flip out.
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:01.160]  This is a serious crime.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:05.160]  And they'll use the cover of a DWI checkpoint. Give me a break.
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:10.160]  The government ships most of the narcotics in on record, the big banks launder it on record.
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:15.160]  And I'm just calling it. I'm done. I'm done.
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:18.160]  And so now I see police eating.
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:20.160]  Hey, you pulled me over randomly. I'm gonna come up and talk to you.
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:22.160]  I'm gonna go, hey, you guys know about the New World Order?
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:24.160]  And they go, yeah, what's we do? And we're trying to wake people up.
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:28.160]  I'm like, oh, great. Well, let me buy a piece of pie or something.
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:30.160]  But I go over there and they get arrogant. They're going to get a whole speech.
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.160]  And if they want to do something to me, go ahead. I'm done.
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:37.160]  I'm not afraid of anybody. I'm only afraid of living like a slave.
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:41.160]  And again, we obsess on the police because you are what?
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:45.160]  Where the rubber meets the road from Romania to Egypt.
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:49.160]  The fight against tyranny. You are going to be key in this.
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:53.160]  We have the 911 audio. We're going to play part of it.
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:56.160]  Let's go to that and then get Watson's take on this.
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:58.160]  Here is part of the clip.
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:00.160]  911.
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.160]  Hi, we have a problem in the Harris Theater of our yard.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:06.160]  We're surrounded by people.
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:08.160]  Somebody fighting.
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.160]  Oh, my God.
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.160]  What's going on?
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:14.160]  We don't know.
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:17.160]  We don't have real police officers. They're not.
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:19.160]  And we're sticking out.
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:22.160]  Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:24.160]  Where is the Harris Theater?
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:26.160]  Did somebody have a gun or something?
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.160]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:33.160]  All right. What's your name?
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:35.160]  I'm Anna Ami.
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.160]  Who's chasing you?
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:38.160]  Pardon?
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.160]  Who's chasing you?
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:44.160]  Okay. We were surrounded by like six people and they started flashing.
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:50.160]  Well, they were yelling at us and then we like didn't know if they were real police officers.
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:54.160]  By the way, it's normal to be scared by people running up craze.
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:56.160]  Stop it for a minute.
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:01.160]  And it just gets worse as they scream and yell and drag them out and then throw them on the concrete and charge them with felonies.
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:04.160]  But this is what it's all about.
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:09.160]  The fun of rushing in on two women in a parking lot who've bought cookie dough.
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:13.160]  Again, over alcohol, over marijuana, over all these things.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:19.160]  It's just an excuse to say we're all suspects, but the government, historically, that's the most dangerous thing.
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:21.160]  That's a fact.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:24.160]  And it gets even more horrific.
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.160]  It's linked up on infowars.com.
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:31.160]  How much more of this is there, guys?
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:34.160]  And again, there's five minutes of this. It gets real bad towards the end.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:38.160]  You can hear them when they're drugged out on the road and the phone's still picking it up.
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:40.160]  That happened in Virginia.
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:43.160]  Let me go to Paul Watson on this.
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:49.160]  Then we have the other video up on the site of West Virginia where the cop flips out at a warrantless checkpoint
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:53.160]  because the guy doesn't want to answer all their questions and let them search his car.
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:55.160]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:58.160]  And the argument is we're going to find bad guys.
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:01.160]  What, you might find a felon with a gun?
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.160]  But they never seem to get the actual bad guys.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:09.160]  No, it's always about us because the state is literally feeding off of us.
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:13.160]  We have the biggest prison population in the world, Paul.
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:22.160]  Well, yeah, because it's an industry, but in this case, they charged her with two assaults because her vehicle grazed two of the agents.
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:28.160]  So she has, even though they attacked her and apparently from what I read before, they were plain clothes.
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:30.160]  So she didn't even know they were cops.
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:34.160]  There could have been a gang of thugs just attacking her, which is actually what they were.
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:36.160]  But she got charged with assault.
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:43.160]  Good news is that they dropped the charges last week, so, you know, there is a shred of common sense left.
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.160]  Well, let me tell you how this is with some of these undercovers now in areas where this is put up with.
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.160]  And again, it varies department to department.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:50.160]  I'll see them.
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:56.160]  We've seen the surveillance videos in other cases where you'll have two of them walking and a woman tries to go around them.
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:01.160]  And then they walk in front of her and then shove her up against the wall for just fun.
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:06.160]  I mean, it's literal clockwork orange, droogie behavior.
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:13.160]  I really don't know what's going on in America, Alex, because it's, you know, it's pretty bad in other parts of the world in the West.
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:15.160]  But it's never that bad.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:22.160]  People marvel at the level of tyranny that American cops like to engage in because it's just unparalleled.
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:30.160]  You know, we had the story last week of them strapping people down in prisons, forcibly drawing blood while the victim screams,
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:32.160]  you know, what country is this?
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:36.160]  The only place you'd see that is in North Korea or Communist China.
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:37.160]  I mean, come on.
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:40.160]  This article is up on infowars.com.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:43.160]  Hate crime, gays brutally beat Christians in America.
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:45.160]  And we showed part of it, not the really brutal part earlier.
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.160]  I want to show some of the brutal part.
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:49.160]  It goes on for five minutes.
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:56.160]  These Christians are there with their signs on the green, away from the Gay Pride march.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:03.160]  And the people come over and take turns punching them and hitting them for five minutes before piling on and taking the guy's sign away.
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:05.160]  And the police do nothing.
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:10.160]  And I saw the same thing in Seattle in my film, Battle for the Republic, that's online if people want to see it.
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:14.160]  Where the illegal aliens block the road for like an hour.
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:17.160]  So the guy gets out and protest it silently.
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:20.160]  And the police come and slam his head in the ground with blood spurting.
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:29.160]  And the illegals celebrate and join in, knocking the man's windows out with the cops, high-fiving and celebrating as they attack their car.
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:34.160]  I mean, these are just warped gangs working with the police.
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:38.160]  And in Seattle, remember during the WTO, they banned free speech.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:42.160]  You couldn't have in the city an anti-WTO pen.
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:46.160]  Just amazing.
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:50.160]  Well, they use the minority against the majority and we're all being manipulated.
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:51.160]  That's what we need to understand.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:57.160]  These people who beat up preachers, you know, then they complain when cops pepper spray them in the face.
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.160]  Well, you know, join together, support everybody's freedom of speech.
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:03.160]  And then we're all going to be stronger for it.
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:06.160]  Don't nitpick and create divisions and allow yourself to use as a weapon.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.160]  Exactly, cops and good cops are the best about this.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:18.160]  Like, we're going to get the fellow on that was in the New York airport, the sheriff's deputy, who wouldn't arrest the lady for handing out flyers in the comments.
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:22.160]  He goes, no, she has a right to do it, even when he was ordered by the bureaucrat to do it.
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:25.160]  And it turned out the sheriff backed him and he did the right thing.
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:28.160]  This is your right as well, bureaucrats, police.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:31.160]  You are an American as well.
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:35.160]  Stop acting like we're all slaves and you're first-class citizens.
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:38.160]  We need to all come together here.
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.160]  It's amazing, Alex.
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:46.160]  I wanted to get to this other story, though, before I get off, which is basically received next to zero attention.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:55.160]  You remember probably six months ago in the UK, there was this big horse meat scandal where they found like 1% of meat in some beef products was horse.
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:17:02.160]  And they had, you know, government inspecting abattoirs, they had new standards, legislation come out almost immediately.
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:13.160]  Yesterday it came out a lab in Louisiana analyzed Pepsi and Coke and found a cancerous carcinogen that is a caramel colorant used in Pepsi and Coke.
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:18.160]  Eight times the safe limit, this cancerous carcinogen.
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:26.160]  And Pepsi comes out, admits it, says that it's in the drink and says, well, we'll try and get it out by February next year.
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:31.160]  So seven months, this cancerous carcinogen is going to be in Pepsi.
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:35.160]  And do you know what else they put in Pepsi on purpose, part of Bilderberg Group?
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:37.160]  Dead baby cells.
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:39.160]  And again, I first heard this three years ago, I didn't believe it.
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:46.160]  There were federal court cases and they ruled the stockholders of PepsiCo who wanted to stop it cannot stop it.
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:48.160]  So it's baby flavoring.
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:53.160]  I mean, it's just lunacy, lunacy.
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:18:04.160]  You know that it came out, they first tried to claim that was a hoax and a couple of months later when pro-life groups were boycotting Pepsi, they had to come out and admit it and say they were going to remove it.
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.160]  So again, the media treated it as a hoax.
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:11.160]  Two months later, Pepsi admitted it was true and said they were going to remove it.
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:16.160]  But now they're saying, oh, maybe in seven months we'll remove this cancerous carcinogen.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:18.160]  It's in the existing supply.
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:23.160]  Compare that to the horse meat scandal in Britain, which everybody freaked out for weeks and weeks.
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:28.160]  There was legislation immediately, inspections, because some horse meats in beef.
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:30.160]  Yeah, that's pretty disgusting, but it's not going to kill you.
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:33.160]  No, no, they always distract with something like that.
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:36.160]  They always distract with one person died from E. coli.
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:38.160]  Don't eat any greens ever again.
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:43.160]  Meanwhile, oh yeah, we're putting hydrofluorosalic acid in your water fluorine.
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:45.160]  It does kill you.
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.160]  It does cause massive cancer and brain damage.
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:52.160]  Harvard study, but we're going to keep doing it and laugh at you if you don't like it.
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:55.160]  And this, um, it's called four methylimidazole.
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:57.160]  It's this chemical compound.
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:01.160]  It's in roasted foods, grilled meats, coffee, types of caramel coloring.
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:07.160]  2007 study found that high doses of this were carcinogenic in mice and female rats.
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:09.160]  So they've known about it for six years.
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:14.160]  It's eight times the level according to this lab study in Coke and Pepsi.
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:17.160]  And they're saying, oh, maybe next year we'll remove it.
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:21.160]  No, no, no, listen, they had poisons, the secret flavoring in these things.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:26.160]  And in the meat sauces on record, the big industrial ones.
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:34.160]  And also some of the other quote flavor enhancers they use are really poisons on purpose.
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:39.160]  Because they found in major studies that many poisons are actually addictive.
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:46.160]  So what they're doing is adding these poisons on purpose so you wonder why you get a high off of it.
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.160]  It's incredible.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:49.160]  Paul Watson, stay there.
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:51.160]  We're going to come back and take phone calls.
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:56.160]  We're going to talk to Ashley and Derek and Rusty and James and Bulldog.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:20:01.160]  He's a police officer who wants to comment on the current situation.

[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:05.160]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:08.160]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:13.160]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:17.160]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:22.160]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:28.160]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally-occurring
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:34.160]  compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:38.160]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:41.160]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:46.160]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com.

[02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:57.160]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:21:57.160 --> 02:22:00.160]  Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:30.160]  Our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:34.160]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:40.160]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:47.160]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:50.160]  and ultimate extermination.
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:53.160]  The war is here. It's an info war.
[02:22:53.160 --> 02:23:00.160]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:03.160]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:09.160]  For more than 15 years, I have exclusively used Midas Resources for all my precious metal needs.
[02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:14.160]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, Midas Resources is simply the best.
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:17.160]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:23.160]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic anytime.
[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:28.160]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:31.160]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:36.160]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:43.160]  Midas brokers are standing by to answer all your questions at 800-686-2237.
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:50.160]  They also have a lot of informative free literature explaining the opportunities and risk of holding precious metals.
[02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:55.160]  They are ready to answer your questions at 800-686-2237.
[02:23:55.160 --> 02:24:01.160]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:13.160]  I've been kind of jibbering today and I appreciate everybody putting up with me. I've been off for two days and just get totally wound up.
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:17.160]  I think it's good to do this more often though because my voice is back and it's not hard to talk.
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:20.160]  So thanks for letting me take a couple days off.
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:25.160]  With the family listeners, though, I've been out there shooting YouTube videos every couple hours.
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:32.160]  But let's go to your phone calls. Bulldog in Washington says he's a police officer who wants to comment on current events.
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:34.160]  You're on the air, Bulldog.
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.160]  Hey, good afternoon. How are you?
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:40.160]  Oh man, I tell you, it's a crazy world. How are you?
[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:45.160]  It is. I just wanted to tell you, you know, it's being a field training officer for years.
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:47.160]  I call it contempt of cop.
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:53.160]  When a police officer is challenged and he or she may not know what to say, they'll bull up.
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:55.160]  And I call it contempt of cop.
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:59.160]  And I explain that to all the new recruits to come in over the years and listen.
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:01.160]  We don't always have the answers.
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:09.160]  And I was always taught as a young police officer, I've been a cop for 16 years, is when in doubt, don't do it.
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:17.160]  And always act, always know by what a 40 you are on.
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:23.160]  Because the problem is, you've got a lot of young police officers coming in out of the military.
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:28.160]  And it's the training that they're getting at the academy that you're seeing the more of this combative behavior.
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:33.160]  That's right. They were in Fallujah a year before and now they're there.
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:37.160]  And of course, I do things and get mad and afterwards feel like a jerk all the time.
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:40.160]  I'll be rude or bow up. You know, we've got testosterone.
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:42.160]  I know police have a tough job. I want to be clear about that.
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:48.160]  But if people sign up for it and then you've got a power structure that wants to corrupt the police,
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:53.160]  it's up to the police culture to resist that.
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:57.160]  And look, I want to be honest, I know the police have been resisting being warped.
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:02.160]  I know that internal battle is going on. Do you have any comments on that?
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:05.160]  Well, I agree and it all comes down to this, Alex.
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:08.160]  It's training, training, training and recruiting.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:13.160]  The state I work in in Washington state has some of the highest standards throughout the United States for policing.
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:22.160]  We're a very extreme, we're a liberal state and it's probably one of the best states for citizens to live in
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:24.160]  because we do honor people's rights.
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:27.160]  I found that in the rural areas in some of the smaller towns.
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:33.160]  But what about Seattle where they let, you know, gay people, 15 of them beat up a preacher?
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:38.160]  Well, I watched that video and it looks like SPD did to their job. They arrested the guy with the big gut.
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.160]  It's kind of funny, his girlfriend, a wife that was with baby care, just kind of kissing the police's rear.
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:47.160]  But in the background, you could see that police officer watching that guy's iPhone.
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:51.160]  Oh, see, I missed that. I didn't even pick. Okay, I'm wrong again.
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:53.160]  Oh, so they did arrest him. Good.
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:59.160]  Yeah. And, you know, this is the, I live on the eastern side of the state, which is more conservative than Seattle.
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:06.160]  I mean, that's unfortunately King County and Pierce County dictate what the rest of the state does and they're super liberal over there.
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:10.160]  So I'm grateful I work in a very conservative area.
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:15.160]  And I can honestly tell you in the county that I work in, people still wave with all their fingers.
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:21.160]  I mean, we're highly respected and we treat the citizens with respect and this is what I'll tell you in closing.
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:28.160]  I am a public servant and I tell the new guys that come on, we are servants first. We serve the people.
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:34.160]  That's who pays our paycheck. And let me tell you, the majority of the guys, at least in my area, they have that mentality.
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:39.160]  And that's why people respect us. We partner with the community and that's why you don't have to let me ask you this briefly.
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:42.160]  And we're going to get Watson's take on this and more calls.
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:49.160]  Are the police starting to notice that the government is publicly running Al Qaeda overseas and doing all this creepy stuff?
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:54.160]  You know, the guys I talked to, I'll be honest with you, they just want to do their job.
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:58.160]  They're just there to do their job and go home to their families.
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:04.160]  Some of them think that I'm a little out there of conspiracy theory, but that's okay because I know that I'm telling the truth.
[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:06.160]  I know, but exactly. Here's my message to people.
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:12.160]  Look, things have gotten crazy. We've got to get out of this normalcy bias. God bless and be safe out there, sir.
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:15.160]  And I appreciate you being a public service. Thank you for your service.
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:18.160]  Oh, people listen to me, folks. This is not a game, okay?
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:22.160]  I may bounce around and act crazy and stuff because it gets to me, okay?
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:27.160]  The New World Order is real. This takeover is real.
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:31.160]  The federal government has been taken over by foreign crazy banks.
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:36.160]  They're installing snooping systems in all the appliances. Watson, final comments.
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:39.160]  I'm going to come back with Kaiser and the rest of the callers.
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:43.160]  Final comments on cops is, I guess, you know, a lot of them are friendly.
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:46.160]  They're doing their job as they should be and it doesn't get in the news.
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:55.160]  So that's what I cling on to. I just don't understand how many of them can't differentiate between, you know, obvious criminal scum,
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:29:00.160]  which they have a very difficult job in dealing with and people who simply know their rights.
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:06.160]  Why do they lump them into the same category when it's very obvious that they're a different kettle of fish?
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:07.160]  I don't get it.
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:13.160]  Exactly. I mean, why beat up a woman who asks you a few questions?
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:17.160]  I mean, it's crazy. It's just, it's crazy.
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:23.160]  And I'll tell you, it's almost always the narcotics squads, the special groups that have been corrupted,
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:27.160]  who are just around scum all day and they just become scum themselves.
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:32.160]  Almost every major narcotics squad in this country, folks, has police that are dealing drugs on it.
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.160]  In fact, it's the exception when they're not.
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:38.160]  And the Mexican mafia where I live in Texas is buying the police off.
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:41.160]  I just hate watching our country rot.
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:48.160]  I mean, America is rotting and it's positive to admit that's happening so we can turn it around.
[02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:18.160]  Privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:23.160]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine,
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:27.160]  we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:32.160]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it,
[02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:34.160]  they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:37.160]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:44.160]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:31:09.160]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:14.160]  We are providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:33.160]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,
[02:31:33.160 --> 02:31:37.160]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:42.160]  We have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:48.160]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:13.160]  There's a need for new world order, but it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:29.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:35.160]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:43.160]  And joining us is Max Kaiser, inventor of the Hollywood Virtual Stock Exchange,
[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:47.160]  used by counter and Fitzgerald today on many of the stock exchanges of the world.
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:51.160]  And of course, he was a successful stock trader before he retired, I think at age 40.
[02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:54.160]  He's an old man now, 51, I think, if I'm going from memory.
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:56.160]  And he has maxkaiser.com.
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:00.160]  It has the Kaiser Report on RTs and BBC TV shows, you name it.
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:04.160]  Got a chance to hang out with him in person over in London covering Bilderberg 2013.
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:10.160]  And I still haven't gotten over the fact that we haven't properly talked about what a victory that was to have.
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:11.160]  Let's not exaggerate.
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:18.160]  4,000 people show up in one day, 1,000 turned away at one time, right above the Bilderberg Hotel.
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:21.160]  Just amazing to have them exposed.
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:22.160]  And I haven't gotten to that.
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:24.160]  I'm going to cover that more on Sunday.
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:28.160]  Luke Radowski was sent on his private email that nobody knows about if we are changed,
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:32.160]  which really scares them because it's a youth movement that's not partisan.
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:34.160]  It's about liberty.
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:36.160]  I helped him launch it.
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:42.160]  Luke was sent an email that said, oh, this is Bilderberg inside info downloaded here.
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:44.160]  And it was child porn.
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:47.160]  And they did this right before he was about to reenter the U.S.
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:52.160]  And he was able on the Yahoo to scan it in preview and realize that was going on.
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:54.160]  But that's the type of insider stuff Bilderberg does.
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:35:00.160]  And I thought I would add that at the times I've been death threaded, particularly bad, were right after Bilderberg meetings.
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:10.160]  The ones where they're listening to your phone and they tell you what you were just talking about when they death threat you.
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:11.160]  And it's Bilderberg.
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:13.160]  I mean, it's people associated with them.
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:15.160]  That's happened twice.
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:17.160]  It's happened other times too, right after Bilderberg.
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:27.160]  It's happened in front of witnesses where I, you know, my, you know, I'm talking to my wife about one of her family members in the hospital.
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:31.160]  I go, all right, I'm getting on the plane in about an hour and a half about to leave this restaurant.
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:33.160]  It was a great event.
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:34.160]  We really exposed them.
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:37.160]  I love you by and then she calls back later, you know, two minutes later crying.
[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:44.160]  They've called up and said, you know, they hope her parent dies and they're going to get us and all this.
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:45.160]  And I've got it on speakerphone.
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:48.160]  The guys are hearing and then it's happened to me before.
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:53.160]  And I didn't mean to segue off into Bilderberg, but that's what the NSA can do.
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:58.160]  They have 840 something thousand private contractors with access to the NSA databases.
[02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:02.160]  Now under the core system, they're going to have access to all your medical records.
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:04.160]  You got herpes.
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:05.160]  You had a heart attack.
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:06.160]  Don't want people knowing.
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:07.160]  You got HIV.
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:08.160]  Don't want people knowing.
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:09.160]  I had a drug problem.
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:11.160]  Don't want people knowing.
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:12.160]  Had gallstones removed.
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:14.160]  It's not anybody's business.
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:17.160]  Don't want, you know, you're getting ready to try to get a job.
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:18.160]  You don't want to.
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:19.160]  It's all being shared.
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:24.160]  They're just mainlining none of us having any privacy at any level.
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:27.160]  And I saw the video of Luke that's up on info wars.com.
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:30.160]  He is completely freaked out in the video.
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:33.160]  He said it was just absolutely horrible what they sent him.
[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:37.160]  And it's NATO and the globalist NATO has been caught running.
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:43.160]  Not just child kidnapping, but but but child snuff films that's come out in the Italian news, especially.
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:45.160]  I mean, it is the worst of the worst.
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:49.160]  He'll kill a million plus Iraqis just to get their oil and have weapon cells.
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:51.160]  The globalist think of you as dogs.
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:56.160]  They will let our own troops breathe nerve gas knowing.
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:59.160]  There you go.
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:02.160]  This is the type of insanity.
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:04.160]  I guess they've got one of the audio keys in there.
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.160]  They think of you.
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:07.160]  You know, that was Max Kaiser.
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.160]  They think of you.
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:09.160]  He makes anything a joke.
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:12.160]  I tell you, he's even more eccentric than I thought knowing him in person.
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:17.160]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that they think of you as absolute garbage.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:22.160]  They knew they were ordering the demolition of 200 plus giant chemical bases.
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:23.160]  The biggest chemistry.
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:24.160]  One of the biggest in the world.
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:26.160]  I keep going back to this every day now.
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:29.160]  Just as if this doesn't get through to you, nothing will.
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:31.160]  Oh, wounded warrior.
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:32.160]  Oh, trips, blood, legs blown off.
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:33.160]  Oh, it's horrible.
[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:35.160]  Yeah, I give money to that kind of stuff.
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:38.160]  My point is what about sending him to fraudulent wars?
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:42.160]  What about them having nerve gas?
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:46.160]  Our own government blows it up, but they don't want to admit they've bonded up.
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:47.160]  So they say, oh, don't wear any mask.
[02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:48.160]  It's false alarms.
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:51.160]  That's how evil these globalists are.
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:53.160]  They run all the major vices.
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:55.160]  They run all the major crime syndicates.
[02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:56.160]  They're evil.
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:58.160]  The government is run by evil people.
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:03.160]  And we better have a real debate about this and stop being naive.
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:04.160]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:06.160]  I'm going to shut up and go to Max Kaiser.
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:08.160]  I saw this this morning.
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:09.160]  I wanted to get him to pop in for 10 minutes.
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:10.160]  He's doing that.
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:12.160]  Then we'll go back to your phone calls.
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:13.160]  Here's some of the articles.
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:20.160]  Bond's tank after jobs report, 10 year yield sores of 2.7.
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:22.160]  And that is out of business insider.
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:31.160]  Here's one out of economic collapse blog that links through to a bunch of mainstream stories on this issue.
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:37.160]  Have central bankers lost control? Could the bond bubble implode even if there is no tapering?
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:40.160]  So we'll explain what all this means.
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.160]  The type of inside manipulations going on.
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:46.160]  Kaiser has predicted the bond market would implode by the end of April.
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:49.160]  He says he's been a few months late and we're starting to see signs.
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:50.160]  He may be right.
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:54.160]  Max Kaiser, thank you for joining us on July 5th, sir.
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:55.160]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:39:00.160]  Well, you know, the NSA, they're stooping on all these medical records.
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:05.160]  I had access to my own NSA medical records recently.
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:11.160]  Apparently I've got a Kissinger stuck in my colon and they're trying to get it out.
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:13.160]  So I don't know who I've got it called.
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:14.160]  Do I call the government?
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:15.160]  Do I call Kissinger?
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:19.160]  How do I get this Kissinger out of my colon?
[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:27.160]  By the way, so Alex, as you know, last year on your show, I said that the bond market would sell off sharply,
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:32.160]  that there would have the end of the 30-year bond rally.
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:34.160]  And I said it would happen in April.
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:38.160]  And I was off by a few weeks or two months.
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:44.160]  The tip of the top of the bond market came about roughly two months later, which is okay.
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:45.160]  That's a pretty good prediction.
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:50.160]  And as a result, now you're entering from a 30-year bull market in the bond market,
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:53.160]  which means that interest rates for 30 years have been going down.
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:58.160]  So people who have been refinancing in their homes have experienced that their mortgage rates have been going down
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:03.160]  or people that are getting a savings account at banks, they notice that their return on their savings account
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:05.160]  keeps going lower and lower because interest rates have been going down.
[02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:12.160]  But now you're entering into a secular bear market for bonds, which means that interest rates are going to start moving up
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:16.160]  and will probably just move up for the next 10 years.
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:23.160]  So the economy is heading into the very strong headwinds of rising interest rates.
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:26.160]  And so that's what I was looking for.
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:27.160]  That's what's happened.
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:32.160]  And the question is, will the central banks, will Federal Reserve Bank,
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:37.160]  will the new guy here at the Bank of England, will they be able to swoop in,
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:42.160]  print another trillion or so in currency and money,
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:47.160]  and buy back lots of these bonds that are reckless, that are out of control now?
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:48.160]  They're crashing.
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:53.160]  Will they be able to buy enough to get interest rates back down to where they were at historic lows?
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:55.160]  I don't think they're going to be able to.
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:41:02.160]  So we have now the beginning of the bond apocalypse, as I have called it, and that is a major event.
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:07.160]  Now, the money coming out of bonds is going into things like stock market.
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:08.160]  It's going into the oil market.
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:13.160]  You know, the oil market is still above $100. It's not going into the gold market at the moment.
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:15.160]  And we can talk about that at some point.
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:21.160]  You know, that is not a market that anyone is jumping for joy at the moment.
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:26.160]  But we know we can talk about the dynamic forces of that market at some point.
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:30.160]  But anyway, the bond market, as we have discussed on your show a year ago,
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:32.160]  I said it would top out. It has.
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:35.160]  And that's what people are freaking out about now.
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:40.160]  Now, again, you're an expert in this. You were very successful working in the stock market.
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:47.160]  You worked, of course, with George Soros' son and had a lot of legendary successes in the market.
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:50.160]  And so a lot of your predictions, unfortunately, have been accurate.
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:54.160]  To be honest, I was glad when your prediction in late April didn't come true,
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:59.160]  because even though I don't like this corrupt system, I'm not looking forward to the train wreck of it crashing.
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:06.160]  And then the new too big to fail power grab, the authors of our great pain will get out of it.
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:08.160]  So that's what I'm really not looking forward to.
[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:13.160]  I don't like seeing you lose credibility because I think you're an interesting smart guy and really say what you believe.
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.160]  And I didn't think you lost credibility because who can guess exactly what's going to happen
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:24.160]  when they've got so many manipulative tricks up their sleeves with all their different computer systems to manipulate.
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:30.160]  But at a certain point, I mean, gold goes up, gold goes down, it keeps going up for 15 years or 13 years.
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:36.160]  I don't even really look at the price. I don't even worry about it because I know this paper is all going to die.
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:41.160]  There may be something new that comes out of it, but regardless, so I agree overall,
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:47.160]  which is a layman who's interviewed hundreds of the world's experts on this in my general understanding of economics.
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:52.160]  But how were you able, because it looks like now your huge prediction is starting to come true.
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:56.160]  You know, a few months late, you said it'll start there.
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:58.160]  You even said where it would spread the types of bonds.
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:01.160]  It looks like it's the same types of bonds you talked about.
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:02.160]  You said what would come out of that.
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:06.160]  But you couldn't tell me last week when you were on and we reared it yesterday.
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:08.160]  So we're back to back Kaiser today, the double Kaiser here.
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:12.160]  Sounds like it's strange type of not or something, but you were.
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:25.160]  Exactly. But what I'm trying to get at here with you is specifically lay out the mechanics of this because last week you couldn't really answer it.
[02:43:25.160 --> 02:43:31.160]  Is Bernanke going to taper with QE unlimited QE affinity or are they going to keep pumping?
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:34.160]  Because obviously they know and the insiders are going to do this.
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:37.160]  So they make even bigger profits with your ear to the ground.
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:39.160]  What do you know about that?
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:46.160]  Well, many pundits have tried to pick this bond turn and very famous pundits more famous than I am.
[02:43:46.160 --> 02:44:00.160]  For example, Jim Grant of the interest rate observer or Jim Rogers, you know, co-founder of Quantum Fund, Mark Fauber who you found on your show, Peter Schiff.
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:02.160]  We've had them all on you.
[02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:09.160]  Of course, Gerald Solante. So I mean, I just went out and decided they all they say the trend is there. We're looking for a turn.
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:14.160]  I said, you know, here's a date, April 15th, you know, making a bold prediction.
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:18.160]  You know, and now it looks like that that prediction was only off by a couple of months.
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:27.160]  But I mean, this whole side of the equation of pundits, if you will, looking at the debt that's been raising in the system really since World War II.
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:36.160]  You know, the American GDP, the American growth has been financed through American banks and central banks taking on trillions of dollars with their debt.
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:43.160]  Under Obama, the amount of debt that Obama has allowed the Federal Reserve and other institutions to take on eclipses really anything Bush was up to.
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:47.160]  And it's almost it's more than all the debt ever before ever undertaken before Obama.
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:53.160]  So the American debt indebtedness is now way higher than than anyone could have imagined it.
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:55.160]  And at some point, the debt becomes a factor.
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:57.160]  So is he going to taper?
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:02.160]  I don't, you know, I, this is, here's my analogy, and I'll give you an analogy.
[02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:04.160]  And it's a funny analogy.
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:12.160]  And unlike most of my funny comments, this is, this happens to be funny by the fact that it is a, it's a funny image, but I'm not trying to be funny.
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:20.160]  But imagine if you were to swallow a porcupine, you know, the quills are facing out as you're swallowing that porcupine.
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:26.160]  Now imagine, imagine regurgitating that porcupine and the quills are now sticking in your throat.
[02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:34.160]  That's the problem with unwinding all this debt is that it's not, you just simply can't flip a switch and unwind.
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:38.160]  Plus they took all the bailout money and re-leveraged it into even bigger derivatives.
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:40.160]  Well, that's, that's exactly right.
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:50.160]  The, all of the quantitative easing and all that money has been used as collateral to build up this ever bigger pyramid of debt.
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:58.160]  And up until 2007, it didn't matter so much that there was a lot of debt because interest rates kept going down.
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:01.160]  As I told you about interest rates have been going down for 30 years.
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:04.160]  So no matter how badly the economy was doing.
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:07.160]  How big is this pile of Kissinger?
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:09.160]  In my colon right now.
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:10.160]  I mean, no period.
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:15.160]  I mean, I think we should now call, no longer call it the dirty word poopy.
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:17.160]  It's now known as a Kissinger.
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:22.160]  Well, officially, you know, it's in the 15 to 16 trillion range.
[02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:31.160]  But unofficially, if you look at a bank like JP Morgan, you know, JP Morgan alone on their off their balance sheet, they have 90 trillion in debt or derivatives.
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:33.160]  That's a big Kissinger.
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:34.160]  Yeah, that's huge.
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:41.160]  So they've got a massive Kissinger that's blocking the JP Morgan digestive tract in a big way.
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:47.160]  And so my point is, though, now that rates are going up, though, you see, it becomes harder to unwind.
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:49.160]  This is just like your house.
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:57.160]  I mean, if your house, if you bought your house when, when mortgage rates were low, and now a year or two later, you're trying to sell your house.
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:04.160]  But it's a lot harder to get money because mortgage rates are moving higher and the price of your house might be the same or sinking.
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:06.160]  You can't, you can't sell your house.
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:08.160]  So because the environment is completely sure.
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:10.160]  So bottom line, it doesn't matter what they do.
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:13.160]  So you don't know if they're going to taper or not taper.
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:18.160]  No, no, the question is if they will or won't, they won't because they have no choice.
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:20.160]  And it gets back to what we've been saying.
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:22.160]  But it doesn't matter because the interest rates are already going up.
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:30.160]  What's going to, what's they're going to attempt to do, in my opinion, is they're going to attempt to, the Bank of England just got this guy, Mark Carney,
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:37.160]  and he and the ECB both announced simultaneously that they're going to keep interest rates where they have been.
[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:42.160]  This implies to me that we're going to see a new era of global central bank cooperation.
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:50.160]  And they're going to try to create a global bad bank or slush fund to try to keep rates from going higher.
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:52.160]  So it's going to be...
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:57.160]  But let's expand on that. What I'm seeing happening is that just like you had LIBOR and Coordination on interest rates,
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:04.160]  I'm seeing real interest rates go up even though the official number stays at zero or whatever.
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:08.160]  So they'll still get free money, but we won't.
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:15.160]  The bondholders are going to be serviced at the cost of the economy.
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:22.160]  What's happening without a shadow of a doubt is that the wealth and income gap all over the world is widening.
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.160]  There's an official estimate of this called the Genie Coefficient.
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:28.160]  You can look it up on Google.
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:30.160]  They call that the Kissinger effect.
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:34.160]  It's the effect of having too many Kissingers lodged in your...
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:36.160]  That's enough. Go ahead.
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:43.160]  But the Genie Coefficient tracks how wide the disparity is in an economy between rich and poor.
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:49.160]  We know that in places like Saudi Arabia, obviously, there's a huge disparity between the ruling kingdom
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:51.160]  and the people at the bottom.
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:57.160]  And in a place like America, it's known for a place that has a very more egalitarian society.
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:04.160]  But in America and Western Europe now, and especially in European countries like Greece or Cyprus or Ireland,
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:07.160]  that is now exploding so that there's a wealth and income gap.
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:09.160]  And there's not a coincidence there.
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:11.160]  We see a lot of social unrest.
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:13.160]  We see now revolution again in Egypt.
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:15.160]  We see social unrest all over Europe.
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:17.160]  We see in Brazil. We haven't seen anything.
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:23.160]  Sure, as you said five years ago on the show, as these interest rates go to zero and as money's devalued worldwide,
[02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:26.160]  the places where they're living at subsistence are going to blow.
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:28.160]  So let me ask you this question.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:34.160]  In layman's terms, what do you now expect to happen that they're moving towards the bond market breaking up?
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:37.160]  They won't try to keep that bubble going?
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:42.160]  They will try to keep that bubble going and they will try to do global coordination of interest rates.
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:49.160]  And in my opinion, the whole NSA prism scandal is about trading on inside information,
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:53.160]  because all the high-frequency trading machines on Wall Street that go in there and they scout money,
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:55.160]  that's all based on insider trading.
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:57.160]  And to make that work, you need information.
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:00.160]  And to get that information, that's what this prism NSA spying is all about.
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:03.160]  It's not about security. It's not about keeping anybody safe.
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:06.160]  It's about making the bond holders of these banks and the central banks.
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:08.160]  It's about rigging markets and having intel.
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:10.160]  Yeah, it's market rigging.
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:12.160]  That's what prism NSA is all about.
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:14.160]  And so they're going to be more invasive.
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:16.160]  They're going to want more information.
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:19.160]  There's going to be more reaching into people's bank accounts.
[02:50:19.160 --> 02:50:23.160]  There'll be more bail ins, which is a euphemism in Europe for what we saw in Cyprus,
[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:25.160]  where they just take money out of your account.
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:29.160]  So there'll be more of that wealth grabbing from accounts or bail in.
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:30.160]  I'm going to do some overdrive.
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:37.160]  Thomas for the callers like Rusty and James and Derek and Grant and William.
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:38.160]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:40.160]  We've got Kaiser for one more segment.
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:44.160]  I want to ask you about what you think of Mohammed Morsi over there
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:45.160]  and the military coup against him.
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:49.160]  You've been to Egypt quite a bit and broadcast live from there on this show.
[02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:52.160]  So you've been to Egypt in the middle of all this a year ago.
[02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:54.160]  I want to get your take on it now with Max Kaiser.
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:56.160]  I'm your host Alex Jones.

[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:17.160]  All right, continuing.
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:19.160]  I only got a few minutes left with Max Kaiser.
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:22.160]  We're going to start the next hour and I promise to get to these calls.
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:24.160]  Max, a moracy.
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:29.160]  I don't like military coups, but this guy was out of control and backed by Obama.
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:31.160]  And Obama is and the globalists are very mad.
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:33.160]  He's been thrown out.
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:37.160]  But I mean, 14 million people hit the street, the army, it turns out, went to him and said,
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:39.160]  well, they're going to get down.
[02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:41.160]  They will overthrow all of us.
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:43.160]  So I'm not saying they're even angels either.
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:50.160]  But the head of a Syria, I think rightly has said this is the death of political Islam.
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:54.160]  Now that the West is trying to hype up to tear that place up.
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:56:04.160]  What do you make of this Orwellian bizarro paradox of our government and NATO openly running the Al Qaeda people?
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:07.160]  10 million people are even higher numbers than that.
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:09.160]  These are the people.
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:12.160]  They're out there and they want to change their government.
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:13.160]  They had an election.
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:15.160]  The guy they elected turned out to be a loser.
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:18.160]  He said all the wrong things, said all the wrong things.
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:20.160]  So they're going to try it again.
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:27.160]  Now, I would equate the army in Egypt with America's Second Amendment right.
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:29.160]  In America, we've got a Second Amendment right.
[02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:32.160]  In Egypt, they've got the army, the guy with the guns.
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:37.160]  So what happened was the guys with the guns and the people got together and they had an extended revolution.
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:38.160]  They had another revolution.
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:39.160]  They're going to try it again.
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:47.160]  So I think on my Twitter, I said, look, the big difference is that Egypt has the cojones to go out there and do the revolution.
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:48.160]  They got the guns.
[02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:49.160]  They got the revolution.
[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:51.160]  In the United States, they got a Second Amendment, but no revolution.
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:57:00.160]  So at least Egypt is trying to get rid of the US puppets and put in representational government.
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:03.160]  I mean, it's not just that. These are bad US puppets.
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:05.160]  I mean, they put a guy in.
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:06.160]  They're all bad.
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:08.160]  What's a good US puppet?
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:09.160]  They're all terrible.
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:10.160]  The US is totally lost.
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:11.160]  It's way here.
[02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:13.160]  So there's no good US puppet.
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:14.160]  It's terrible.
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:16.160]  You're servicing a very bad, evil place.
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:22.160]  The only thing keeping it alive is this artificial pumping up to the US dollar, the World Reserve currency.
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:24.160]  Once that's over, then it's all over.
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:26.160]  So this is the last gas for the US dollar.
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:27.160]  They go for the dollar.
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:28.160]  They crash gold.
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:30.160]  We know the whole story that's going on there.
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:35.160]  The bond market, however, is telling us that the days are numbered for the dollar.
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:36.160]  Sure, Max.
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:39.160]  I'm not defending US puppets because they're really globalist puppets.
[02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:48.160]  My point is, the globalists put the worst people they can in to screw things up even more so they can buy it up even cheaper.
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:54.160]  And that's even what the Pentagon says about the global banks, is they're destroying US future just for short time profits.
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:55.160]  They're crazy.
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:57.160]  So the Egyptians figured this out.
[02:57:57.160 --> 02:57:59.160]  They figured this out in less than a year.
[02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:00.160]  They figured it out.
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:02.160]  They got on the street and now he's gone.
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:03.160]  So they figured it out.
[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:05.160]  The kudos to them.
[02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:13.160]  Now, you know, even Jefferson said, I mean, the soil of liberty has to be watered every 50 years with blood or something of this nature.
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:18.160]  Well, yeah, the tree of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants, every generation.
[02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:21.160]  Well, we're overdue, Alex.
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:22.160]  We're overdue.
[02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:30.160]  I tell you what, man, I just want to try to fix this peacefully, but these crazy bankers, I don't know what their problem is, but they're really cruising for a bruising.
[02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:32.160]  Max Kaiser, thank you so much.
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:33.160]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:34.160]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:58:34.160 --> 02:58:35.160]  There he goes.
[02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:36.160]  All right.

[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:31.160]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:32.160]  Appreciate you holding.
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:33.160]  We're live.
[03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:35.160]  It's the day after the fourth or fifth.
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:37.160]  Or maybe that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:00:37.160 --> 03:00:40.160]  And then we'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Rusty in Canada.
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:41.160]  Thanks for holding them.
[03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:44.160]  We'll go to everybody else that's holding like Derek.
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:45.160]  Go ahead, Rusty.
[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:47.160]  Alex, how's it going, buddy?
[03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:48.160]  Pretty good, brother.
[03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:50.160]  I just want to thank you for having me on the show.
[03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:51.160]  It's an absolute honor.
[03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:54.160]  I've been listening to you for just over six months now.
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:58.160]  And I just want to say that there was some times, you know, I did my research on you.
[03:00:58.160 --> 03:01:00.160]  And there's a lot of people that are getting at you.
[03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:03.160]  It's easy to doubt and turn away, but I gave you the benefit of the doubt.
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:06.160]  I listened to your show religiously for six months.
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:10.160]  Your team, the people that you've surrounded yourself with, they counterbalance you and
[03:01:10.160 --> 03:01:11.160]  who you are.
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:14.160]  I think you guys got a lot to offer to combating this new world order.
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:16.160]  And I think in all honesty, we've already won.
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:21.160]  We just have to stick to our guns and be consistent and just do what we believe is right.
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:22.160]  And, you know, good always prevails.
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:27.160]  You might have to go through some stuff, but, you know, to me, there's a lot of hope here.
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:29.160]  And you guys are definitely, yeah, I respect you.
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:31.160]  Well, you're the type of call I love because you're talking about hope.
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:32.160]  And I need to do that more.
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:35.160]  I get so focused on the bad that's happening.
[03:01:35.160 --> 03:01:38.160]  It's good to show the good that's going on.
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:41.160]  In fact, I've told my reporters we should show the good cops.
[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:46.160]  We should show the good people in government, the good private citizens, the good everybody.
[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:49.160]  And I, I want to hold up the good.
[03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:54.160]  Sometimes that's better to dispel the darkness is to hold up the good.
[03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:56.160]  So then you recognize the darkness even better.
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:59.160]  I tend to just focus on the darkness, the darkness, the darkness.
[03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:02.160]  Like people are going to do something about it instead of leading by example.
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:06.160]  So you've hit a good critical point there, but I was thinking about this the other day.
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:09.160]  The way Cohen tell pro works and these operations work.
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:11.160]  And this has been declassified.
[03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:14.160]  The White House regulations are bragged about a Cass Sunstein.
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:18.160]  I'm glad you raised this is they put out a claim just, you know, just a meme.
[03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:23.160]  Alex Jones is this Alex Jones is that, you know, Alex Jones is a hundred bad things.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:30.160]  And then just hope people get diverted off by that instead of looking at what I'm actually covering and saying.
[03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:39.160]  Because if you'll actually listen to what I'm covering and saying, you'll find out about 95% of it is open source publicly admitted.
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:41.160]  Maybe 5% speculation.
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:45.160]  You know, sometimes I might be 80% right about something that I'm predicting down the road.
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:51.160]  But when it comes to what I'm generally covering, we're talking high nineties accuracy.
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:54.160]  And I thought about the Paul Revere contest.
[03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:57.160]  It's actually, I was corrected over the weekend.
[03:02:57.160 --> 03:03:02.160]  Felt like the weekend the last two days, the July 4th holiday by my crew.
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:05.160]  It's over 600 entries.
[03:03:05.160 --> 03:03:15.160]  So we'll have to announce it sometime later in the month because I've got to announce who, you know, who the real winners are here and not do a week job of this.
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:19.160]  Or a catty Wampus, you know, crooked job of this.
[03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:25.160]  But I mean, what a positive thing $120,000 in prizes.
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:33.160]  To then have 600 films, some of which are as good as anything you see on HBO.
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:38.160]  But from a Liberty perspective, together getting millions of views now.
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:40.160]  That is money well spent.
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:42.160]  It sounds like a lot of money folks in media.
[03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:44.160]  It's not a lot of money.
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:54.160]  But I did it to to really give people a focus to empower themselves and who knows what connections will come out of that or what filmmakers will then, you know, meet each other.
[03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:55.160]  And what will happen?
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:57.160]  I did it to try to put some funding.
[03:03:57.160 --> 03:04:00.160]  The globalists put billions into globalist propaganda every year.
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:03.160]  We just put $120,000 into it.
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:04.160]  Haven't paid it yet.
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:05.160]  We've had dozens of contests.
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:06.160]  We pay them all.
[03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:07.160]  We will.
[03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:09.160]  And how could anybody say I'm negative or bad?
[03:04:09.160 --> 03:04:12.160]  You know, they'll say, well, I admit he woke me up, but he's a bad guy.
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:14.160]  He's an agent or blah, blah, blah.
[03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:19.160]  I mean, who, who put out $120,000 to get.
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:21.160]  Well, my listeners did by supporting me.
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:22.160]  You did this.
[03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:35.160]  You are as big a part of this as I am to get $120,000 to get people thinking out there as seed money to then make all these great films from different angles.
[03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:45.160]  I mean, that's all we are is a focal point for all these other activists and all these other leaders and all these other people that are being abused to have a debate to wake people up.
[03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:49.160]  That's our agenda is to get people thinking, not even what we're thinking.
[03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:50.160]  So of course I'm for real.
[03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:51.160]  Of course I'm good.
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:58.160]  And of course they've got to attack that and say I'm not because they know full well I'm for real and evil cannot stand it.
[03:04:58.160 --> 03:05:27.160]  More calls coming up.

[03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:53.160]  No, no, actually James is first up.
[03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:55.160]  Then we're going to go to Derek.
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:59.160]  No, I get this so confused sometimes in the phone system because I try to go in order.
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:02.160]  Derek in Alabama, let's go to you. Go ahead.
[03:09:02.160 --> 03:09:04.160]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[03:09:04.160 --> 03:09:06.160]  Good, sir. Welcome.
[03:09:06.160 --> 03:09:12.160]  I want to tell you I appreciate everything you do for the liberty and people of this country.
[03:09:12.160 --> 03:09:16.160]  I really do appreciate it and I just had a couple of points.
[03:09:16.160 --> 03:09:23.160]  I was flipping through the news the other night and I never really stopped on many of the mainstream channels,
[03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:29.160]  but I caught inside edition and then I'm going to tell you, they did you wrong, Alex.
[03:09:29.160 --> 03:09:35.160]  You know, on the whole Michael Hastings thing.
[03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:40.160]  What did they do?
[03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:44.160]  Oh, they ended you up to be just an outright liar.
[03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:47.160]  They took you out of contact, had the wrong little experts.
[03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:51.160]  I say that with quotation marks, you know.
[03:09:51.160 --> 03:09:54.160]  It was pretty bad.
[03:09:54.160 --> 03:10:00.160]  Well, I can't keep track of all the TV shows and newspapers that are doing the same tactic.
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:10.160]  They're trying to assassinate my character ahead of perhaps setting me up with drugs or who knows what or killing me.
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:15.160]  And the order has definitely gone out liberal, conservative, libertarian, fake outfits.
[03:10:15.160 --> 03:10:25.160]  And in every case, they, I mean, I've had his best buddy on who said he went to the funeral and talked to the wife and she says,
[03:10:25.160 --> 03:10:27.160]  I'm going to bring down whoever did this close quote.
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:32.160]  They think he was probably killed and then they criticized me in the media for saying it should be investigated.
[03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:34.160]  Where is the media's instinct?
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:35.160]  Well, they're not media.
[03:10:35.160 --> 03:10:36.160]  They're not news.
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:38.160]  They're not journalists to stick up for each other.
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:46.160]  I mean, in the old days of the reporter got killed, it was a big investigation regardless, even if it looked like it was cut and dry case.
[03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:50.160]  This is clearly foul play all over the place.
[03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:51.160]  And they're going out.
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:59.160]  I mean, you would think that a day after I had his buddy on who got the email and all of it saying they're coming after me.
[03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:00.160]  I'm going into hiding.
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:03.160]  I'm getting death threats and that the family thinks they killed him.
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:05.160]  You would think that'd be national news.
[03:11:05.160 --> 03:11:11.160]  But no, no coverage because it's a bunch of cowards that all they want is their paycheck.
[03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:17.160]  And they don't get that once everybody sells out, total tyranny comes in.
[03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:23.160]  They just don't understand how the insecurity is in that they have no honor.
[03:11:23.160 --> 03:11:28.160]  And so I didn't see it and I saw comments online about it.
[03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:29.160]  I just didn't really pay attention.
[03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:36.160]  But listen, I come on air and say we can't let them kick Rush Limbaugh off the air with their boycotts.
[03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:42.160]  And, you know, he's not perfect and I have problems with a lot of what he does, but at least he's pro second amendment.
[03:11:42.160 --> 03:11:47.160]  And, you know, he's the biggest show in the world with 20 something million listeners.
[03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:52.160]  And then I add, you know, I've been up against him in cities and gotten better ratings than him.
[03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:56.160]  And then they write an article saying I say I'm bigger than Rush Limbaugh.
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:11:59.160]  And, you know, and that I'm a liar.
[03:11:59.160 --> 03:12:03.160]  And then they show statistics to say I'm a liar.
[03:12:03.160 --> 03:12:07.160]  And it's just you realize they want people to think I'm a liar.
[03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:13.160]  And maybe I should be glad they're trying to assassinate my character instead of me.
[03:12:13.160 --> 03:12:17.160]  But see, they're trying to assassinate Liberty's character by assassinating me.
[03:12:17.160 --> 03:12:19.160]  And I appreciate your call.
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:21.160]  Anything else, Derek?
[03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:29.160]  I just wanted to let people know that I think people see the news and they hear what you say.
[03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:35.160]  And they think that these things with the police and the corruption that it only goes on in large city.
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:39.160]  But I live in a town of 5,000 people.
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:41.160]  I see abuses every day.
[03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:45.160]  I watched the police drag race up and down the main highway.
[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:52.160]  I watched black helicopters fly over my apartment at least once a week, sometimes twice.
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:57.160]  And I mean they, and then circle for 35, 45 minutes.
[03:12:57.160 --> 03:12:59.160]  No, they look at their walls.
[03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:03.160]  I know they ship the drugs in and then use it as an excuse to spy on all of us.
[03:13:03.160 --> 03:13:04.160]  So sick.
[03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:07.160]  They ship the terrorists in and then use them as an excuse.
[03:13:07.160 --> 03:13:09.160]  It's elementary.
[03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:10.160]  You're exactly right.
[03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:14.160]  And I just want people to know that these things don't just go on in big cities.
[03:13:14.160 --> 03:13:16.160]  They go on in little town.
[03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:18.160]  It's not a big city problem.
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:20.160]  It's a countrywide problem.
[03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:22.160]  And it's going to get worse as the economy collapses.
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:25.160]  They're converting everything to the police state economy.
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:35.160]  I mean, how could I sit down by a group of people talking about how they're going to work for the NSA?
[03:13:35.160 --> 03:13:41.160]  And all so proud of it, like they're graduating to a new plateau of the galaxy or something.
[03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:48.160]  It was just, this is just graceful, despicable and painful because they're not even really bad people.
[03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:49.160]  They're just idiots.
[03:13:49.160 --> 03:13:51.160]  I appreciate you calling in.
[03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:54.160]  It really gets to me.
[03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:55.160]  But again, we should be more positive.
[03:13:55.160 --> 03:13:57.160]  A lot of people are waking up.
[03:13:57.160 --> 03:14:01.160]  James in Detroit, folks said that NAFTA and GATT would deindustrialize Detroit.
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:03.160]  I guess they were conspiracy theorists.
[03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:04.160]  James, you're on the air.
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:05.160]  Welcome.
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:09.160]  Alex, you are a godsend, a savior to us.
[03:14:09.160 --> 03:14:10.160]  Oh, please.
[03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:18.160]  Since I first started listening to you, 14, 15 years ago, the black helicopters dusting a small town outside of Boston.
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:20.160]  You had a couple of people call in.
[03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:22.160]  Everybody got the flu.
[03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:30.160]  They saw and fly over the school with spray tanks and even got photos as it sprayed them and then everybody got sick.
[03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:32.160]  We are under attack by criminals.
[03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:35.160]  It's a basic, simple group of people.
[03:14:35.160 --> 03:14:37.160]  They are career criminals.
[03:14:37.160 --> 03:14:39.160]  They own the banks.
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:46.160]  Nothing but short of country control is entertainment to them, a plane, a jet, an island.
[03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:48.160]  None of that stuff matters to them.
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:50.160]  Now it's total global control, as you've said.
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:52.160]  Jesse, running for president would be great.
[03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:59.160]  He would have to find a system as massive and as efficient as organized for America, Westboro, Obama.
[03:14:59.160 --> 03:15:05.160]  Now it's turned into organized for action, which is attacking across the NRA and all of the other conservative groups.
[03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:09.160]  There would be a very difficult system to overthrow because it is so...
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:17.160]  We have to overthrow it individually in our own areas by not complying, by saying no, by putting our bodies against the machinery.
[03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:25.160]  The government machinery comes to a halt the minute we realize it's illegitimate and start withdrawing our compliance.
[03:15:25.160 --> 03:15:26.160]  That means verbally.
[03:15:26.160 --> 03:15:30.160]  That means when somebody is out of line, you don't lay down to it.
[03:15:30.160 --> 03:15:31.160]  God bless you, sir.
[03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:32.160]  You want to talk about the Iraq invasion?
[03:15:32.160 --> 03:15:33.160]  Go ahead.
[03:15:33.160 --> 03:15:35.160]  Here's what happened.
[03:15:35.160 --> 03:15:46.160]  Young soldiers were in these oil tankers that they confiscated on the highways, not filled with oil, filled halfway with gold bricks.
[03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:53.160]  Many of these young Marines were taking pictures with their camera phones of these events and these abductions of these trucks and tankers.
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:58.160]  Inside, front to back, filled to the halfway level, gold bricks.
[03:15:58.160 --> 03:16:02.160]  Alex, the size of regular gigantic building block bricks.
[03:16:02.160 --> 03:16:03.160]  Were you there?
[03:16:03.160 --> 03:16:04.160]  No, I was not there.
[03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:09.160]  No, I've seen the pictures and now I tried long before I realized I have to.
[03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:16.160]  It's not to save the address because after this stuff sits on the web for a couple of days and someone spots it, it's erased.
[03:16:16.160 --> 03:16:19.160]  I've now been trying to capture as many things to my hard drive as I can.
[03:16:19.160 --> 03:16:20.160]  Okay, but the point is, what are you saying?
[03:16:20.160 --> 03:16:22.160]  A bunch of looting went on in Iraq?
[03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:26.160]  Well, the gold was probably the first fringe benefit.
[03:16:26.160 --> 03:16:39.160]  The second fringe benefit was massive amounts of these super bills. You remember it all being spoken about 200, 300 billion parcels of these bills hidden in walls of buildings and outposts, etc.
[03:16:39.160 --> 03:16:44.160]  Along with these, I mean, all the leads for the tankers was to grab the gold.
[03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:48.160]  Second and foremost, the super bills just disappeared to the people who were looking the other way.
[03:16:48.160 --> 03:16:51.160]  Well, send me an email about it so I understand it.
[03:16:51.160 --> 03:16:54.160]  I appreciate your call, James. Good to hear from you.
[03:16:54.160 --> 03:17:03.160]  Let's talk to William in Connecticut. Thanks for holding William.
[03:17:03.160 --> 03:17:10.160]  William's listening to his radio. Put him on hold. Let me try him again. Grant in Colorado, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:17:10.160 --> 03:17:11.160]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:12.160]  Good, sir.
[03:17:12.160 --> 03:17:25.160]  On the 4th of July, I went to a gated community, and this was a private security officer, but I'm talking full tactical, flak jacket, magazine holsters, everything.
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:31.160]  Outside of a gated community, just to get in for the 4th of July. I don't know who was there, but yeah, it wasn't police.
[03:17:31.160 --> 03:17:34.160]  It was a private security firm, and it's just, yeah, it's ridiculous.
[03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:37.160]  Oh, yeah, they're doing this everywhere. It's like a status thing.
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:46.160]  Like in Latin American mafia and stuff to have guys with guns as status. It's status now to be groped. It's status to have riot police.
[03:17:46.160 --> 03:17:53.160]  They had riot police out at checkpoints. We have articles up in riot gear to fight terrorists and know that it's for us.
[03:17:53.160 --> 03:17:57.160]  They're just getting us used to riot police everywhere.
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:17:59.160]  Gee, I wonder why.
[03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:07.160]  No, yeah, I was driving up, and after listening to the stuff that happened, I was like, oh, I'm going to get checked, and then check us. You just want to know who we knew in the neighborhood.
[03:18:07.160 --> 03:18:11.160]  Again, just making those connections, and then I had a question I wanted to...
[03:18:11.160 --> 03:18:16.160]  Well, no, I mean, it gets you used to always being questioned like you live in the former U.S.S.R.
[03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:22.160]  Exactly. It's all about learning to have hands put on you, learning to be questioned. Go ahead.
[03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:24.160]  And then the question I wanted to field.
[03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:30.160]  So in elementary school, I was in the class with John Benet Ramsey. I'm still involved in that case.
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:37.160]  And about two years ago, two detectives from Boulder PD came up and asked for a cheek swab before I listened to you.
[03:18:37.160 --> 03:18:41.160]  So I gave them a cheek swab, and they both told me it would be destroyed when they're done with the case.
[03:18:41.160 --> 03:18:46.160]  And I called about two days ago because of listening to you and asked them if they'd been destroyed.
[03:18:46.160 --> 03:18:51.160]  And they said, oh, no, they misinformed you. We keep it locked in a vault forever and ever and ever.
[03:18:51.160 --> 03:18:57.160]  And it's like, do I have a case against them? I have, you know, three or four people in the room and that's why they would destroy it.
[03:18:57.160 --> 03:18:58.160]  So...
[03:18:58.160 --> 03:19:06.160]  Well, I think you should assume just to expose it because the government's been taught to lie just as an automatic default.
[03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:16.160]  I mean, look, I learned from someone in the Air Force, a nurse, in 1996 that they were taking blood from every baby in the country
[03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:22.160]  and putting it in a UN database. And one of the databases for a multi-state area was in San Antonio.
[03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:30.160]  And I read these documents on air. Of course, it wasn't until a decade later that people heard my show, found out about it, sued, got the documents,
[03:19:30.160 --> 03:19:37.160]  and then now it became a big national news story, and then we learned all over the world it was happening, just as my source told me.
[03:19:37.160 --> 03:19:41.160]  They do whatever they want is my point. Of course they do.
[03:19:41.160 --> 03:19:46.160]  And I'll go back to what I said at the beginning of the show when I said last hour, what I'll say this hour.
[03:19:46.160 --> 03:19:50.160]  This is the most important thing. It hit me so hard yesterday.
[03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:57.160]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of declassified and leaked and exposed programs.
[03:19:57.160 --> 03:20:01.160]  Some of the programs had tens of thousands of people in them.
[03:20:01.160 --> 03:20:06.160]  Some of the programs had only a few hundred people in a small town.
[03:20:06.160 --> 03:20:14.160]  But it varied. The point is that many of these programs were lethal,
[03:20:14.160 --> 03:20:20.160]  where the government would kill large groups of totally innocent, good people.
[03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:24.160]  It wasn't like they were just killing people that had been arrested for armed robbery.
[03:20:24.160 --> 03:20:29.160]  That would be bad enough because you're like, a government that can do that, you know, could do it to anybody.
[03:20:29.160 --> 03:20:38.160]  This is a government that knew if they could get army scientists going back to the 20s and 30s who were eugenicists.
[03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:46.160]  Remember Hitler got all his ideas from us to euthanize people, to nerve gas their own troops, to test biologicals on them.
[03:20:46.160 --> 03:20:51.160]  The argument is we've got to do this to find the cure that will save millions.
[03:20:51.160 --> 03:20:57.160]  But really it's higher ups that just want to see if they can create groups that will do anything.
[03:20:57.160 --> 03:21:01.160]  Really to find out who enjoys it, who enjoys hurting people.
[03:21:01.160 --> 03:21:05.160]  And out of that, they've built those groups up to be larger and larger and larger.
[03:21:05.160 --> 03:21:10.160]  And they are doing mass secret testing. The evidence keeps coming out everywhere.
[03:21:10.160 --> 03:21:15.160]  And they're doing it in the water, the food, everywhere.
[03:21:15.160 --> 03:21:20.160]  And it's all over the top.
[03:21:20.160 --> 03:21:25.160]  And so that's why I can't even really get mad at the minions of this system.
[03:21:25.160 --> 03:21:35.160]  Because it's so diabolical that the minions don't even have any imagination what they're dealing with.
[03:21:35.160 --> 03:21:42.160]  And I feel completely unworthy because my mind, just like your mind, is more sophisticated than my speech is.
[03:21:42.160 --> 03:21:46.160]  I understand this. I can make all the connections. I can see the big picture.
[03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:50.160]  And it's something indescribably evil.
[03:21:50.160 --> 03:21:57.160]  And when I'm sitting there in a calm, focused place, I just see the devil.
[03:21:57.160 --> 03:22:03.160]  In my mind's eye, with all this data, it is an alien force. It is not of this world.
[03:22:03.160 --> 03:22:10.160]  It is so destructive and anti-life. And it's hoodwinking everyone that's involved in it.
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:14.160]  It's hoodwinking everybody that thinks they're winning and getting power from it.
[03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:18.160]  And I just recoil from it.
[03:22:18.160 --> 03:22:26.160]  And the higher ups of this system, there's like a fake loving sweetness to them and a fake calmness to them.
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:33.160]  And they'll say, but you know it's for the greater good. You know there's too many of us.
[03:22:33.160 --> 03:22:37.160]  And when you talk to these people that are higher up in the system who know all this,
[03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:43.160]  but have made the decision to rationalize it to themselves because they're afraid of it and to play along with it
[03:22:43.160 --> 03:22:52.160]  and then promote the evil agenda, it really just makes me dislike myself.
[03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:59.160]  Because I should be doing more. I should find that rosetta stone of enlightenment and awakening
[03:22:59.160 --> 03:23:03.160]  that can move this lever so we can save humanity.
[03:23:03.160 --> 03:23:07.160]  But then I realize I'm just a man. And I'm doing the best job I can.
[03:23:07.160 --> 03:23:17.160]  I get frustrated by all the fake criticisms of me because I like real criticism to help me be better.
[03:23:17.160 --> 03:23:22.160]  But when it's manufactured and fake and based on people sitting down and going,
[03:23:22.160 --> 03:23:28.160]  what lie can we manufacture off some scrap of something that's true to build a larger lie around it?
[03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:36.160]  It hurts me for them.
[03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:42.160]  This is a system that rewards evil. This is a system that rewards corruption.
[03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:49.160]  This is a system that rewards dishonor and backstabbing.
[03:23:49.160 --> 03:23:55.160]  And it is designed to bring us to the lowest common denominator.
[03:23:55.160 --> 03:24:02.160]  It's a giant sucking sound and it doesn't just suck the jobs out of Canada into the U.S. and to Mexico,
[03:24:02.160 --> 03:24:08.160]  then to China, then they get rid of the human workers and put in robots and release bioplegs
[03:24:08.160 --> 03:24:11.160]  and kill off the population or sterilize people.
[03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:15.160]  And then the giant sucking sound goes deeper than that.
[03:24:15.160 --> 03:24:20.160]  And it's just like, what? We're going to all play along with a black hole?
[03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:25.160]  We're going to play along with death? We're going to play along with Satan?
[03:24:25.160 --> 03:24:32.160]  Satan isn't a hot devil cheerleader, folks, in a mini skirt.
[03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:37.160]  Satan is death on this planet.
[03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:40.160]  And I'm telling you, that's where the rabbit hole ends.
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:48.160]  And I can't believe what we've put up with so far.
[03:24:48.160 --> 03:24:54.160]  And how easy it would be to break the power of this evil if good people would just stand up
[03:24:54.160 --> 03:25:00.160]  and recognize it. We just put up with more and more and more and more
[03:25:00.160 --> 03:25:07.160]  because the modern system is so slick at projecting a facade.
[03:25:07.160 --> 03:25:12.160]  Let's go to these calls here. Let's go to Robert in California, says he's a pilot.
[03:25:12.160 --> 03:25:15.160]  I want to talk about the TSA. Thanks for holding, Robert.
[03:25:15.160 --> 03:25:19.160]  Yeah, Alex. Yeah, I'm a pilot. You know, I just recently got back into aviation,
[03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:23.160]  so I hadn't really been dealing with going in and out of the country in private aviation.
[03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:26.160]  I just want to kind of point out, you know, if you are a rich and privileged,
[03:25:26.160 --> 03:25:30.160]  you do not go through TSA or anything like that when you go out to your plane.
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:33.160]  So if somebody wanted to, you know, bring something in or get a nuke on a plane,
[03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:36.160]  it'd be so easy to do the ridiculous.
[03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:40.160]  Oh, no, they all know, because exactly, it's all totally fake.
[03:25:40.160 --> 03:25:43.160]  You know, you pull up and they've got drinks, caviar, whatever.
[03:25:43.160 --> 03:25:48.160]  You go on the private jet, because I've been on private jets on Hollywood People's Jets and others.
[03:25:48.160 --> 03:25:51.160]  That's how Glenn Beck flies around, some more power to him.
[03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:54.160]  But the $500 tickets that goes here and speaker, whatever.
[03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:58.160]  But, yeah, there's no TSA there.
[03:25:58.160 --> 03:26:02.160]  And that's why Alec Baldwin and all these guys say, I think the TSA is great.
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:05.160]  Well, yeah, because they're all on private aviation.
[03:26:05.160 --> 03:26:10.160]  Exactly, exactly. And the guy, the customs guy, he just basically stuck his nose in the airplane,
[03:26:10.160 --> 03:26:13.160]  swiveled his head right and left, and that was it.
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:15.160]  They didn't open that. Well, they don't even do that now.
[03:26:15.160 --> 03:26:23.160]  I've been on, I've been on wide body, you know, $30 million aircraft and there's nobody there.
[03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:29.160]  All they do is put your name in and phone it in with Homeland Security that you're flying on that aircraft.
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:34.160]  And if they're calling it a test flight or a demo flight by the airline,
[03:26:34.160 --> 03:26:38.160]  and a lot of those things are comped and stuff, then it's not even on record.
[03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:44.160]  I've been on aircraft trips where I'm not even on record, I'm on the plane.
[03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:48.160]  By the way, Alec, I was introduced to you, but I was actually coming back from Mexico,
[03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:52.160]  I've been living there for six years, and the guy who introduced me to you was actually the border agent
[03:26:52.160 --> 03:26:57.160]  when I first crossed the border. The first guy talking to you in the US soil was the guy who turned me on to you guys.
[03:26:57.160 --> 03:26:59.160]  What did he say?
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:03.160]  He said, things here are falling apart because you've got to listen to infowords.com.
[03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:05.160]  Alex Jones will tell you all about it.
[03:27:05.160 --> 03:27:09.160]  And this was the actual customs agent. The first guy that I talked to when I, you know,
[03:27:09.160 --> 03:27:15.160]  pulled over my passport, you know, and was crossing the border over in Laredo.
[03:27:15.160 --> 03:27:18.160]  Well, that's awesome, brother. Yeah, good to hear from you.
[03:27:18.160 --> 03:27:22.160]  That is absolutely true about the private aviation.
[03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:27.160]  I mean, I grew up with my dad, you know, owning a little Cessna and, you know, owning a little aircraft.
[03:27:27.160 --> 03:27:31.160]  So, I mean, I remember just going out, getting the plane taken off, you know,
[03:27:31.160 --> 03:27:35.160]  to go visit Grandma or whatever and land the plane in the cow pasture.
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:42.160]  But a few times I've flown, it's like Star Wars flying on these private jets.
[03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:50.160]  I mean, you're up with the pilots and you can see planes flying by where they're going 600 miles an hour and you're going 600 miles an hour.
[03:27:50.160 --> 03:27:54.160]  And those flight lanes, and I mean, it's like Star Wars.
[03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:59.160]  And to me, it's obscene, though, when there's a butler there, you know, getting the food out for you.
[03:27:59.160 --> 03:28:03.160]  I just can't do it. I'm not even saying it's bad to have a private jet.
[03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:11.160]  I just, you know, I could not, because I could go do events and charge people 200, 400, 500 dollars a year when we speak.
[03:28:11.160 --> 03:28:16.160]  That's really where the big money's at. I should probably do that, not by private jets, build up this media operation.
[03:28:16.160 --> 03:28:20.160]  That's probably the answer, is do the big professional talks and do that.
[03:28:20.160 --> 03:28:23.160]  And again, it's not bad to have a private jet and have a butler.
[03:28:23.160 --> 03:28:29.160]  I just, I mean, I would take every bit of that money and put it towards fighting the globalist.
[03:28:29.160 --> 03:28:33.160]  We're buying hospital beds for kids in Africa and stuff like I've done before.
[03:28:33.160 --> 03:28:37.160]  I spent a little bit of money on things like that. I don't know, but I guess I'm a bad person.
[03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:44.160]  Let's go to a real fast, there was a caller who wanted to talk about something I thought was really important, but I guess we're out of time.
[03:28:44.160 --> 03:28:48.160]  Phil in Florida, real fast on Michael Hastings. Go ahead.
[03:28:48.160 --> 03:28:55.160]  Hey, Alex. First of all, everybody, I mean, it's already been in movies. They can control the car from up in space.
[03:28:55.160 --> 03:28:59.160]  I mean, there's a movie out where they shut the car down because it was in an accident.
[03:28:59.160 --> 03:29:05.160]  No, I mean, that's on record. They all have the cell phone in them, the new modern cars that they can control it from space with a satellite.
[03:29:05.160 --> 03:29:10.160]  Yep. Darphead. Darphead admits that, but yeah.
[03:29:10.160 --> 03:29:16.160]  Well, I'm just trying to know that I'm preaching to the choir by calling you, but the second thing, huh?
[03:29:16.160 --> 03:29:17.160]  No, you're not. Go ahead.
[03:29:17.160 --> 03:29:26.160]  Okay. So the second thing is, is that the question about this NSA stuff is, so they're collecting the calls or holding calls. Everybody just loves it. Yeah, whatever.
[03:29:26.160 --> 03:29:31.160]  I don't care. But can they manipulate the call? Can they make it look like you called Osama bin Laden?
[03:29:31.160 --> 03:29:42.160]  Well, that's why I got into what happened to Luke Radowski. The NSA planted a few years ago child porn on like 20,000 computers at the Pentagon to blackmail everybody there.
[03:29:42.160 --> 03:29:50.160]  No, no, I mean, it's the National Pedophile Implantation Facility. That's what it is. It's blackmail central.
