[00:00.000 --> 00:24.080]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:24.080 --> 00:30.080]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.080 --> 00:58.080]  technocracy tank-over. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:58.080 --> 01:05.520]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble. A real debate. Not a debate where we
[01:05.520 --> 01:11.600]  have an establishment Republican and establishment Democrat. We haven't had a real debate in this
[01:11.600 --> 01:17.920]  country since really the 1980s. And Reagan wasn't perfect, but he was a political insider until he
[01:17.920 --> 01:22.560]  got into the White House. The power structure did try to keep Ronald Reagan out of power because
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.400]  they didn't trust him and thought that he was a real guy. And the year into his presidency, of
[01:28.400 --> 01:34.240]  course, they had to shoot him to physically try to get control of him. And that gets into a whole
[01:34.240 --> 01:38.960]  another kettle of fish, a whole another story, but most of you are already fully aware of that.
[01:39.600 --> 01:43.600]  This is the first real debate. They had that Commander-in-Chief forum a few weeks ago that was
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.960]  a joke where Hillary was able to stand up for 30 minutes. There's new footage out today on
[01:48.960 --> 01:55.600]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com if we're coming out of Chelsea's $10 million facility. And I'm
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.320]  not in class envy here, but they are. And they got their money through robbing Haitian
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.960]  earthquake victims and stuff. And so that's why I have a real issue with them. And here she comes
[02:08.960 --> 02:14.240]  out of the $10 plus million penthouse and looks very, very sick. It looks like she's having to
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.280]  really focus what she's doing. And then, oh, she's the media and suddenly, you know, oh, she's fine.
[02:20.880 --> 02:25.920]  Nice little Joker face. But the bigger issue here is something Paul Watson picked up on.
[02:26.480 --> 02:33.280]  And that's that. Why is she wearing a 70 plus degree weather, a full winter trench coat with
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.920]  several layers of clothing on under it? Just a question. And it was, you know, 80 something
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.200]  degrees. In the last few weeks there, she was wearing even heavier garb. Maybe she just likes
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.040]  to dress in a formal, formal fashion, but notice she's coming out real slow. She's got secret
[02:49.040 --> 02:52.480]  service around her. She's watching her step. As soon as she sees the camera, head goes up,
[02:52.480 --> 02:59.040]  shoulders go up and she just goes on down those stairs. We know she's having epileptic seizures.
[02:59.040 --> 03:04.880]  We know she's falling down. We told you that was happening first. And now you notice it happened
[03:04.880 --> 03:09.200]  on camera. And the media desperately tried to cover it up. And that's the big question. How will
[03:09.200 --> 03:15.040]  they try to throw her softball questions tonight? Most Americans in a Rasmussen poll think that
[03:15.040 --> 03:20.640]  they'll be, you know, basically throwing softballs for her. What are they going to do? Will she make
[03:20.640 --> 03:26.960]  the debate? We've still got how many hours until it kicks off? Nine hours? What is it? Eight o'clock,
[03:26.960 --> 03:33.040]  central standard time it kicks off? We're going to be here live covering and giving a live analysis
[03:33.040 --> 03:38.400]  to the mainstream media system that's collapsing in front of us that as usual has hijacked control
[03:38.400 --> 03:44.000]  of the public debates to force everybody to go through their lens of propaganda. Well, we're
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.880]  going to be here, you know, the First Amendment breaking that stranglehold tonight, infowars.com
[03:50.880 --> 03:56.880]  forward slash show. And I cannot stress enough, obviously to listeners and viewers out there,
[03:56.880 --> 04:00.960]  how important it is to share that link. There's a lot of people that wouldn't normally be involved
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.680]  in news or information or being awake are tuning in. This is set to have over 100 million viewers
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.160]  just in the U.S. alone, some are estimating, many are estimating, at least bigger than Super Bowl
[04:10.160 --> 04:14.560]  with more than 80 million viewers. And so a lot of folks that aren't aware of what's happening
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.880]  are going to end up tuning in to NBC or CNN or Fox or any of these stations
[04:18.880 --> 04:22.800]  and just getting more of the control paradigm. They tune into infowars. They'll get our analysis
[04:22.800 --> 04:26.880]  for an hour before and at least an hour and a half, probably two hours after and phone calls
[04:27.520 --> 04:34.720]  and expert gas and our reporters there on the ground in New York. They're at the university
[04:34.720 --> 04:37.520]  and we're also going to have some of the right side reporters on. We're going to get some of the
[04:37.520 --> 04:43.920]  right sides feed. So yes, we are going to be actually covering the debate and carrying the
[04:43.920 --> 04:50.320]  debate, but not just giving live analysis. So that's coming up in T minus what eight hours and
[04:50.320 --> 04:58.480]  55 minutes, 10 seconds infowars.com forward slash show infowars.com forward slash app. The new free app is out.
[04:58.480 --> 05:06.000]  Tonight, tune into infowars.com forward slash show starting at 7 p.m. central for live coverage
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.400]  of the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. It's the first major debate
[05:10.400 --> 05:14.960]  of the election. It's 90 minutes long. We're airing it in its entirety commercial free with
[05:14.960 --> 05:18.960]  their own real time analysis of Hillary's lies and emissions to help you separate the truth
[05:18.960 --> 05:22.880]  from the false narrative the mainstream media wants you to believe. Will Hillary even make it
[05:22.880 --> 05:26.880]  through the night or will she collapse on stage due to her failing health? It's going to be a rough
[05:26.880 --> 05:31.120]  night for Hillary. For example, the presidential debate commission denied Hillary her request for
[05:31.120 --> 05:35.280]  a step stool at her podium, according to the dredge report. And as info wars reported in
[05:35.280 --> 05:39.920]  August, Hillary cannot even give a long speech without having a step stool or a secret service
[05:39.920 --> 05:44.880]  agent to lean on for support. And infowars.com has learned that influential Democrats will
[05:44.880 --> 05:48.800]  pressure Hillary to drop out of the race if she has a bad showing at the debate. So again,
[05:48.800 --> 05:54.160]  tune into infowars.com forward slash show starting at 7 p.m. central tonight Monday,

[08:49.600 --> 08:56.720]  justice department controlled the justice department completely lawless admits that it takes its
[08:56.720 --> 09:04.160]  walking orders from unesco a body of the united nations we are a captured nation this is about
[09:04.160 --> 09:12.320]  the return of americanism the return of nationalism versus globalism and that's why the entire power
[09:12.320 --> 09:19.360]  structure in their internal emails not just in their op-eds are panicking globally at donald
[09:19.360 --> 09:28.240]  trump because he is so presidential he is full of stamina and fight and energy and all you have
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.840]  to do is not work against the united states and our economy will turn back on like a roaring
[09:33.840 --> 09:41.280]  engine the problem is the globalist investments in other parts of the world will suffer and
[09:41.280 --> 09:49.120]  they don't like that they wanted to parlay our power into global power but now their world
[09:49.120 --> 09:55.440]  government has been identified and it's dead on arrival yes we're strangling it in the crib

[10:04.640 --> 10:13.200]  evil force on this planet aka to use the allegory of beowulf's fairy tale grendel's mother and that
[10:13.200 --> 10:20.160]  of course is el diablo so we're not out of the woods yet but humanity is rising very very exciting
[10:20.160 --> 10:24.240]  things are happening you know i meant to cover this yesterday and i've got to get to it i'm
[10:24.240 --> 10:27.360]  meant to cover it friday i meant to cover it yesterday i didn't get to it but it ties into
[10:27.360 --> 10:31.040]  everything well you guys pull me all the mainstream news articles where they just
[10:31.040 --> 10:37.920]  announced on friday no one's going to be allowed to be on highways anymore uh within five to ten
[10:37.920 --> 10:43.680]  years all human driven cars will be off the road now remember i told you that 20 years ago people
[10:43.680 --> 10:48.640]  thought i was crazy but i was reading what globalist hoping we're putting in white papers
[10:49.280 --> 10:53.760]  this is their plan you say well that's incredibly bold that'll never happen look at how much they've
[10:53.760 --> 11:00.320]  wanted to do has gotten done human drivers could be banned from the road proposal aims to see areas
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.800]  designated for salt driving cars for the next five years yeah that's just one of the headlines
[11:04.800 --> 11:10.240]  one of the other headlines that's the daily mail is no human driven cars on the road and then five
[11:10.240 --> 11:15.040]  years that's what they're pushing for and then they can tax you and regulate you and totally
[11:15.040 --> 11:20.480]  control your life and control where you live and what you do i saw a new york times article a few
[11:20.480 --> 11:24.880]  weeks ago i meant to cover as well perhaps you can pull it back up where it was how cool this guy is
[11:24.880 --> 11:33.840]  he pays 450 bucks a month for a 40 square foot you heard me right crawl space the size of a coffin
[11:34.640 --> 11:40.880]  so now it's even more avant-garde not have 200 square feet but 40 square feet is the sexiest
[11:40.880 --> 11:47.920]  coolest thing and he's a musician from austin and they celebrate you know the made up loser mentality
[11:47.920 --> 11:53.200]  that you're all gonna be movie stars you're all gonna be rock stars you're all gonna be basketball
[11:53.200 --> 12:01.280]  stars and you're just so cool but you know the the the oceans nearby so you know and of course
[12:01.280 --> 12:07.840]  it's illegal that he lives there probably they say but it's okay this is the renter system this is
[12:07.840 --> 12:14.640]  the new water once a planet of renters that don't own anything but it's so sexy and it's so chic and
[12:14.640 --> 12:20.960]  it's so cool to live in fantasy land and to decide you want to live in a 40 square foot apartment
[12:21.760 --> 12:28.800]  and then end up having uh your basic landlord pay more in taxes than someone say in dallas
[12:28.800 --> 12:39.040]  pays for a 2000 square foot apartment you pay more for less not get something smaller pay less
[12:39.040 --> 12:46.640]  this is the giant scam that is the new world order this is globalism this is austerity this
[12:46.640 --> 12:54.240]  is their system they had a bunch of publications a few weeks ago come out and attack me i guess the
[12:54.240 --> 13:00.240]  directive came down for a rant i did about that i've been doing for three years every few weeks
[13:00.880 --> 13:07.440]  since obama traveled africa asia and latin america and told people that they shouldn't be able to have
[13:07.440 --> 13:13.360]  a car or air conditioning because the quote earth would boil over and then they would write my quotes
[13:13.360 --> 13:19.520]  that made sense and then show his quotes and say i was a cook it'd be like alex jones says that
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.360]  the sun came up in the morning and then it came up there's this new exercise in nothing but pure
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.680]  ridicule that they somehow think is like super intellectual so before i get into trump surging
[13:33.680 --> 13:38.000]  in more of the polls the tsunami intensifying strength what's coming up with the debate tonight
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.560]  the economy huge war news as the russians make the most plain statements they ever made that
[13:44.560 --> 13:49.360]  world war three could happen it could be imminent the syrians are saying that the chairman of the
[13:49.360 --> 13:54.880]  joint chiefs of staff uh came out and said that what he's being asked to do this is a quote would
[13:54.880 --> 14:00.080]  require war with syria and russia and he's not in a position to make that decision
[14:00.080 --> 14:08.880]  that's a headline now i just read to you the quote of course i noticed this morning
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.160]  because i covered this on the sunday show four to six p.m i went and checked some of the youtube
[14:12.160 --> 14:18.240]  uploads of the live radio show tv show and i saw a lot of the comments saying here's alex jones
[14:18.240 --> 14:22.960]  being a fair monger again here's alex it's the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.920]  i want to slap you people upside the head it's what putin was saying earlier this year he goes
[14:27.920 --> 14:30.880]  he's sitting with the press in this meeting and he goes do you understand that the west is
[14:30.880 --> 14:37.040]  moving missiles up to our borders they're trying to push a giant war that that they're loading nuclear
[14:37.040 --> 14:42.800]  warheads in these cruise missiles we've only got two military bases we're not trying to invade you
[14:42.800 --> 14:47.840]  please talk to the american people and let them know how much danger everybody's in
[14:49.120 --> 14:55.920]  and i was attacked in newspapers all over the u.s for being a fair monger and making it up even
[14:55.920 --> 15:00.960]  though my articles had the clips from putin in them and that goes back to mainstream media and
[15:00.960 --> 15:07.520]  this new bizarre thing it does where it doesn't even counter you it just says alex jones says
[15:07.520 --> 15:14.320]  two plus two equals four ha ha ha he's a joke it's literally that stupid you're like but
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.160]  i've been proven right alex is such a cook he said hillan and clinton's falling down having
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.440]  seizures and look she did ha ha ha ha and you're like okay uh and then a bunch of trendies will
[15:23.440 --> 15:31.520]  just go ha ha ha it's like an exercise in idiocracy and it's by design i mean fox news i was watching
[15:31.520 --> 15:37.840]  it this weekend a week and a half after the new york bombing or nine days whatever it is
[15:39.600 --> 15:44.240]  was still saying is it a terrorist attack should we call it a bombing and the the host are sitting
[15:44.240 --> 15:50.160]  there under orders to do this almost laughing when they say it you can see an end is it a bombing
[15:50.160 --> 15:58.560]  it's like is it is it daytime is it september 26 do i have five fingers on each hand
[15:59.440 --> 16:04.000]  it's like asking a two-year-old where's your nose my nose is here where's your ears my ears are here
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.800]  it's like fox news goes we're waiting to hear if our ears are here on the sides of our heads
[16:08.800 --> 16:16.160]  they're talking to us like we are lobotomy patients i mean i'm telling you folks they
[16:16.160 --> 16:22.000]  talk to us like we've been run over by a car and that is just dumb the whole culture down
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.520]  what did you think we'd be right back now at the messages and then there's also this arrogant thing
[16:27.520 --> 16:36.720]  they do where they lecture everyone they lecture everyone in the most arrogant over the top way
[16:36.720 --> 16:41.520]  that i would write an article like this to turn someone against me but see they don't even have
[16:41.520 --> 16:47.280]  any connection to reality they think in this kind of condescension club like like we're all back in
[16:47.280 --> 16:53.440]  you know eighth grade that they're the cool kids bullying us and making fun of us and that we're
[16:53.440 --> 16:58.960]  all going to go curl up in the corner and and you know have a catatonic fit because we got made fun
[16:58.960 --> 17:03.360]  of by these people i'm going to get to an article there's a great example of this here in just a
[17:03.360 --> 17:08.640]  moment and then it ties into a whole cornucopia of serious persecution that's coming against those
[17:08.640 --> 17:15.520]  of us that do know the two plus two equals four but since i mentioned that video uh here is the
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.040]  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff this is from c span
[17:23.520 --> 17:29.920]  general dunford says the us to control all the airspace in syria would require going to war
[17:29.920 --> 17:34.720]  against syria and russia now they'll probably counter and say this is the onion and this isn't
[17:34.720 --> 17:41.920]  real they've gotten to that level now against us okay but this happened here it is for syria what
[17:41.920 --> 17:46.800]  about the option of controlling the airspace so that that barrel bombs cannot be dropped
[17:48.720 --> 17:54.800]  all all the options what do you think of that option sir right now senator for us to control
[17:54.800 --> 18:00.320]  all of the airspace in syria would require us to go to war against syria and russia
[18:00.320 --> 18:06.720]  that's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly i'm not going to make
[18:08.720 --> 18:12.240]  now so far there aren't articles attacking us for for playing this yesterday but there
[18:12.240 --> 18:17.360]  are people in the comments doing and they've got to be trolls and again i don't raise this because
[18:17.360 --> 18:22.000]  oh i've been attacked i feel bad when you've got the russian president saying we're on the verge
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.360]  of nuclear war and every top historical analyst and and retired general i mean there are articles
[18:27.360 --> 18:31.520]  in the news all the time admitting the world is in the most dangerous position it's ever been
[18:32.080 --> 18:40.080]  hands down it's it's not debatable economic crisis biological crisis population crisis wars famine
[18:42.720 --> 18:48.880]  bacteria that are immune to to treatment viruses that are mutating out of control i mean the world
[18:49.440 --> 18:54.880]  is accelerating into the void basically right now we need to understand we're in dangerous waters
[18:54.880 --> 19:00.320]  people say oh that's fear mongering no when i'm out at the coast uh fishing don't have much time
[19:00.320 --> 19:04.800]  to do that these days we go down there and run a boat we're decide to go bay fishing we get the
[19:04.800 --> 19:08.800]  maps out of the gps out and we look at areas that are shallow and areas that you're not supposed to
[19:08.800 --> 19:16.000]  go into and you know we watch what we're doing that's not fear mongering that's being in control
[19:16.000 --> 19:25.040]  the situation that's that's being a good steward and we are hurtling into the abyss right now
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.360]  meanwhile you've got a political class that is so arrogant and then they have a media under them
[19:31.360 --> 19:36.000]  that act just like they do the hubris of the establishment trying to run hillary when they
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.280]  know she's got serious neurological problems going back four years ago the arrogance of the
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.320]  establishment uh trying to steal the nomination from sanders and then doing it successfully
[19:47.040 --> 19:52.240]  and then trying to do it with trump and not being successful uh the hubris of the republican
[19:52.240 --> 19:57.280]  establishment and others running around uh saying go ahead and vote for hillary clinton uh over
[19:58.720 --> 20:05.040]  trump that completely blew up in their face and was the final nail in their coffin it sank their
[20:05.040 --> 20:11.760]  battleship and that ties me into this next article it's up on info wars dot com information
[20:11.760 --> 20:19.600]  liberation that's a great website uh washington post begs readers please stop calling us the media
[20:21.680 --> 20:28.400]  the actual article is a pathetic attempt at rebranding now that they're rightly the most hated
[20:28.400 --> 20:35.920]  people in america nothing less than hilarious chris minahan writes and then it goes through a
[20:35.920 --> 20:40.640]  screenshot of the washington post and the actual article from the washington post let me go ahead
[20:40.640 --> 20:48.960]  and read to you from this listen to the total disconnected mental illness level arrogance
[20:51.840 --> 20:55.760]  because these are followers not journalists they've hired they've recruited followers they have
[20:55.760 --> 21:01.360]  recruited parents they have recruited repeaters and so when you get a bunch of followers together
[21:01.360 --> 21:07.120]  with no real leadership they all just start one upping each other on arrogance it's a very dangerous
[21:07.120 --> 21:15.600]  phenomenon and pride go up before a fault now let's get into this article because it is hilarious
[21:15.600 --> 21:26.160]  if it wasn't so dangerous now this is what the writer at the washington post says dear readers
[21:26.160 --> 21:33.200]  please stop calling us the media there's no such thing so the mainstream media is so discredited
[21:33.200 --> 21:39.200]  now and and knows everyone just calls them the media with a six percent trust rate in in ap's own
[21:39.200 --> 21:45.680]  national study that the washington post i guess editorial board comes out with this to lecture
[21:45.680 --> 21:55.920]  you and say there is no such thing as a media and i've made the point now that if you say you don't
[21:55.920 --> 22:00.640]  like how let's say some soup you order in a restaurant taste they'll just come to you and
[22:00.640 --> 22:05.040]  say what are you a conspiracy theorist you see because you're not allowed to have your own opinion
[22:05.040 --> 22:11.280]  i started making that joke like five years ago i was trying to educate a tsa agent that hey these
[22:11.280 --> 22:16.080]  millimeter wave systems can give you cancer they've given you fake studies especially long-term
[22:16.080 --> 22:19.840]  exposure it's not going to hurt me much but it's really going to hurt you and the aggregate you
[22:19.840 --> 22:25.520]  know about the cancer clusters and i had them repeatedly say oh more conspiracy theories i
[22:25.520 --> 22:31.200]  was trying to give them facts i was trying to tell them what studies to pull up but see oh
[22:31.200 --> 22:37.280]  you're a conspiracy theorist see you just can't even have your own educated view on things but
[22:37.280 --> 22:43.200]  continuing dear readers please stop calling us the media there's no such thing so now there's
[22:43.200 --> 22:53.520]  no such thing you're not even allowed to call us the media because there's no such thing this is
[22:53.520 --> 22:59.920]  the arrogance of wanting to control reality and define everything mother and father's hurtful
[22:59.920 --> 23:05.680]  round pepper bags are racist blonde hair is now a sign of right-wing hate i'm not kidding that's
[23:05.680 --> 23:12.320]  mainstream news i'm getting to that in a moment i'm writing up now this is the washington post
[23:12.320 --> 23:17.600]  i'm writing because i have a request well this is a way to get along with your readers what you
[23:17.600 --> 23:25.440]  have left please stop calling us the media yes in some sense we are the media oh well now it's

[23:31.520 --> 23:37.600]  are the media yes you heard me this is directly out of the ministry of truth 1984 this is how you
[23:37.600 --> 23:44.080]  create illogical mental illness in the population you wonder why our kids are so screwed up they're
[23:44.080 --> 23:50.320]  under all this right now yes in some sense we are the media but not in the blunt way
[23:50.320 --> 23:58.720]  you use the phrase it's so imprecise oh see you are imprecise you are small minded you are little
[23:58.720 --> 24:06.880]  it's so imprecise and generic oh i see oh it's generic oh you're oh you know you know you it's
[24:06.880 --> 24:15.920]  kind of racist then that it has lost any meaning it's how would you put this lazy and unfair so see
[24:15.920 --> 24:20.960]  you're imprecise you're lazy you're unfair we're just calling the big mainstream establishment
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.840]  that are so locked step you've blown what little bit of credibility you may have had left you know

[24:38.880 --> 24:49.120]  road you are being found on the side of the road dead now here comes the mind control fact fact is
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.520]  see you're lazy you're stupid now we're going to define what the media is because it doesn't exist
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.920]  but it does exist but only when i say it exists this is mind control i'm actually reading to you
[24:59.920 --> 25:07.680]  from this this is how they talk to you fact is oh my oh my gosh you're an establishment newspaper
[25:07.680 --> 25:16.400]  owned by Bezos the democratic party oh my gosh thank you please fact is there really is no such
[25:16.400 --> 25:24.960]  thing as the media so so back to the original line it is an invention oh a tool an all-purpose
[25:24.960 --> 25:30.480]  smear by people who can't be bothered to make distinctions oh my gosh no we know the big
[25:30.480 --> 25:37.360]  establishment corporate media that isn't media but our propagandist the new media is the media
[25:37.360 --> 25:43.840]  that filled that vacuum just like the printing press did 500 years ago okay and and into the
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.160]  dark age and brought in the renaissance this is the new renaissance and all day you can set up
[25:48.160 --> 25:54.480]  there on a high horse and say you're not part of the establishment cloistered lobotomized
[25:54.480 --> 26:08.480]  cogitors up in your drooling ivy league towers i was gonna say ivory ivy league towers fact is
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.760]  there really is no such thing as the media oh thank you and i won't use that term anymore thank you
[26:13.760 --> 26:20.640]  for telling me what language i thank you language police again oh it's an invention oh an invention
[26:20.640 --> 26:26.720]  that's evil a tool an all-purpose smear by people who can't be bothered to make distinctions oh we've
[26:26.720 --> 26:31.600]  made our distinctions you've made it very very clear you've hidden behind the mantle that you were
[26:31.600 --> 26:36.560]  media but but you want to arrest and execute the editorial board of the washington post does
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.520]  the main source that got you a Pulitzer prize and that admittedly made you millions of dollars
[26:41.520 --> 26:48.000]  and ad revenue and got all your so-called reporters all over tv and then your reporters wrote best
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.560]  selling books off of it that the washington post connected publisher made still millions more
[26:53.120 --> 26:58.400]  and then now you want a son in prison or executed because you have zero dishonor
[26:59.520 --> 27:05.840]  even narco drug dealers out of mexico if someone made them a crap ton of money and was honorable
[27:05.840 --> 27:11.520]  to them wouldn't kill them out of hand but see you're so dishonorable you're so upside down
[27:11.520 --> 27:18.480]  that narco terrorists are light years leagues better than you you people have negative honor
[27:19.840 --> 27:22.080]  you go out of your way to be dishonorable
[27:25.920 --> 27:29.760]  really it's hard to be as dishonorable as you are i don't know how you do it
[27:31.520 --> 27:36.320]  you people are out of your minds you are out of your minds you promise to keep someone secret
[27:36.320 --> 27:41.920]  you get their info you tell them they're a hero he exposes all this illegal crap and then now you
[27:41.920 --> 27:48.640]  want him arrested and executed wow wow and then now your editorial board comes out and tells us
[27:48.640 --> 27:52.560]  don't consider you the mainstream media you're right you are worse than the mainstream media
[27:52.560 --> 27:59.600]  you are the jewel in the crown of fraud and deceit as roger stone says the worst publication
[27:59.600 --> 28:10.720]  in the united states you are the plague you are the enemy you are a disease so you are you're right
[28:10.720 --> 28:19.920]  we shouldn't call you the media now this is the response hey dumbass we call you shills the media
[28:19.920 --> 28:26.400]  because you all represent the same interest you all support mass immigration and disenfranchising
[28:26.400 --> 28:34.000]  native americans and america you all support the dysfunctionalizing of america through free trade
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.560]  the deindustrialization and you all support the cultural marks and social justice degeneracy
[28:38.560 --> 28:44.720]  agenda if you can't and you don't want to be called the media try acting as independent actors rather
[28:44.720 --> 28:51.280]  than as borg working towards our destruction and then it goes into the trust in the media down to
[28:51.280 --> 28:59.600]  14 to 6 points depending on what study you look at so there you go now when we come back let's talk
[28:59.600 --> 29:05.120]  about why you're such an enemy when you sit there and try to keep the american people in the dark
[29:05.760 --> 29:11.680]  i have stacks of news here where they're now saying birthday cakes that have a policeman on them
[29:11.680 --> 29:16.320]  are racist and won't be begged and where they're saying blonde hair is racist and basically needs
[29:16.320 --> 29:22.400]  to be outlawed and everything else and just to show the agenda plus liberal sign petition to jail
[29:22.400 --> 29:30.320]  donald trump for hate crimes the video is on info wars dot com this is the reality worse stay with us

[30:05.520 --> 30:09.920]  keeps sending weapons to the ices linked out in those front russian government said the militants
[30:09.920 --> 30:15.600]  are armed by tanks apcs filled artillery multiple rocket launchers and heavy weaponry and of course
[30:15.600 --> 30:19.360]  they could have made these weapons themselves nor could they have stolen all of them from the syrian
[30:19.360 --> 30:23.200]  army especially not the american made tome is told that jihadi's used to destroy a russian
[30:23.200 --> 30:28.240]  helicopter last year the russians also pointed out that the us led airstrike that killed 62 syrian
[30:28.240 --> 30:33.040]  soldiers has directly led to ices gaining ground in other words the us just served as ices's
[30:33.040 --> 30:37.680]  air force the u.s. state department has claimed the attack was an accident however fax points
[30:37.680 --> 30:41.440]  to the contrary the reason where the attack occurred has always been under syrian army control
[30:41.440 --> 30:46.320]  with no prior presence of ices sent com even had the audacity to release a statement claiming they
[30:46.320 --> 30:50.560]  have not bombed the area in the past but that's completely false unless they were targeting

[33:11.120 --> 33:24.800]  the info war in history it is the arrogance of elites that almost always brings them down and
[33:24.800 --> 33:33.040]  the establishment we have in this country is drunk on power even as they collapse that's a good thing
[33:34.320 --> 33:40.400]  the problem is it won't go well with the russians or the chinese or others of this hubris and we'll
[33:40.400 --> 33:45.840]  lead the wars and that's obviously something that's more and more on the front burner i've
[33:45.840 --> 33:49.840]  got to tell you the belligerent activities the ceasefire being broken with the russians
[33:50.720 --> 33:56.480]  all the things that are being done to back isaac and al-qaeda in syria and other areas that should
[33:56.480 --> 34:01.760]  be really i think one of the main topics that donald trump brings up tonight and i would go right
[34:01.760 --> 34:08.240]  after hillary and say listen you are the founder of ices you did go into libya you did create a
[34:08.240 --> 34:15.040]  failed state and trump can cite hundreds of mainstream headlines congressional reports you
[34:15.040 --> 34:21.760]  name it it's a fact and general flinn is the one that with general demcy and others led the move
[34:21.760 --> 34:30.560]  five years ago to stop the backing of lohabia's forces see the media will attack trump on that
[34:30.560 --> 34:34.880]  and say he's crazy where did he get this because they know that's what they're scared of they don't
[34:34.880 --> 34:41.040]  want him to keep going down that road because we've got her we've got her the council on fron
[34:41.040 --> 34:46.160]  relations was so arrogant four years ago that they had headlines we've shown them here in their
[34:46.160 --> 34:55.280]  bimonthly publication foreign affairs headline why we need al-qaeda and saying let al-qaeda take over
[34:55.280 --> 35:04.960]  syria that was after a year of denying that 90 plus percent of the fighters in syria were al-qaeda
[35:06.800 --> 35:12.320]  now there's a headline in new york review books why we need al-qaeda you just can't make this stuff
[35:12.320 --> 35:19.040]  up okay let's continue here i want to get into the attack on free speech then the polls latest
[35:19.040 --> 35:23.680]  numbers uh no guest today but paul watson will be joining us for analysis in the third hour
[35:23.680 --> 35:28.320]  david night will host the fourth hour and then i'm going to get start getting prepared and ready
[35:29.200 --> 35:35.360]  from three to six o'clock we're going to go to a pre-debate feed just up there in the debate hall
[35:35.360 --> 35:39.120]  and there'll be some different reporters our reporters and others popping in and then at
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.080]  seven o'clock we're going to have about 25 minutes of produced news and information from around the
[35:44.080 --> 35:50.240]  world and then at about seven 25 i will come in with leon macadoo david night and others
[35:50.240 --> 35:57.440]  for about 35 minutes of live pre-debate coverage and then we will sample and analyze different
[35:57.440 --> 36:04.720]  channels uh from c span uh to you know the uh ap feed you name it and see if they're adding any
[36:04.720 --> 36:08.880]  commentary or see what the moderators are doing we're going to be there analyzing in live time but
[36:08.880 --> 36:15.600]  i'm going to restrict our uh analysis to about 10 of the time but we are going to be again breaking
[36:15.600 --> 36:21.680]  down uh this public event uh the public has a right uh to respond to this we'll be taking phone calls
[36:22.240 --> 36:28.400]  at 9 30 central with a 90 minute debate ends big question will hillary make it will hillary
[36:28.400 --> 36:33.680]  collapse will she have a coughing fit i don't think there's any way even though she's canceled
[36:33.680 --> 36:40.880]  events for the last week that even a rested hillary cannot disintegrate out there in 90 minutes i
[36:40.880 --> 36:46.400]  think you're going to see at least a coughing fit i think that's a sure thing i'll be shocked if we
[36:46.400 --> 36:53.360]  don't uh because the secret service didn't lie to us they said follow her motorcade and you'll see
[36:53.360 --> 36:56.880]  that that she has special lifters on her vehicles
[37:00.400 --> 37:03.680]  and then we said you mean like on the side of the suburban's and they said just go look for
[37:03.680 --> 37:10.080]  yourself we can't tell you and then oh it's a van okay wow oh she's lowered out of the back okay
[37:10.080 --> 37:15.280]  there's a video of that in photos now and they're like yeah and she falls down she falls down sometimes
[37:15.280 --> 37:21.600]  every hour as well as every 20 minutes sometimes we think she's drugged up she knows less uh but
[37:21.600 --> 37:28.320]  it's happening and then a month later we it gets caught on video uh so they're not lying to us about
[37:28.320 --> 37:32.560]  this this is real she was in the hospital for a year her eyes don't point the same direction a lot of
[37:32.560 --> 37:40.320]  the time now our own reporters in cleveland uh two weeks ago a week before she collapsed caught her
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.840]  in a medical tent for 45 minutes before she went out and gave that five minute speech
[37:45.840 --> 37:50.080]  she had to cancel then she went back in the medical tent she's exactly the secret service
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.080]  told us they said just just just just come watch the motorcades okay
[37:57.280 --> 38:00.720]  we're like well what do we look for come on you're smart just come look at the motorcades
[38:00.720 --> 38:07.840]  and then there it is got ambulance stretchers gurneys secret service in body armor pushing
[38:07.840 --> 38:11.600]  the gurneys around in and out of the tent she's in this is what we were supposed to see
[38:15.680 --> 38:19.120]  and all they know is they're covering up somebody who's extremely ill so
[38:22.800 --> 38:26.800]  i think there's about a 30 40 chance she's gonna have to cancel her fall over or something i don't
[38:26.800 --> 38:33.040]  know 95 percent 100 percent she's gonna have a coughing fit the event she canceled monday
[38:33.040 --> 38:36.480]  in the middle of she had to walk off the stage and start coughing as she left i mean she just
[38:36.480 --> 38:39.680]  can't do it she can barely walk down the stairs in new york this morning
[38:48.160 --> 38:52.320]  i'm constantly playing with pins on the air and they've told me i did this again i did this last
[38:52.320 --> 38:56.800]  week and i've got to stop doing it it must be this brand of pin i'm actually a new brand of pin

[39:04.480 --> 39:09.520]  we got a box of these and these little bastards leak so perhaps we should get some new pins here

[40:13.760 --> 40:19.280]  dot com help fund the operation and get mega specials on the super high quality products

[40:27.840 --> 40:33.680]  calling the special and what i'm calling the debate tonight is americanism versus globalism
[40:33.680 --> 40:43.200]  the royal rumble right where the us started new york i mean if any place in america is pure
[40:43.200 --> 40:51.360]  americana folks it's new york and that's why it's so fitting that right there in america's birthplace
[40:53.920 --> 41:02.320]  that we've got the royal rumble between america and the globalist americanism not globalism will
[41:02.320 --> 41:08.080]  be our credo to quote donald trump so the reclaiming liberty presidential debate special
[41:08.960 --> 41:15.840]  for the americanism versus despotism really but globalism special is free shipping store wide
[41:15.840 --> 41:21.280]  exclusive release of biome defense probiotic i'm about to tell you about that 20 off super
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.240]  male vitality and then it will end today because we're already extended it will end today i promise
[41:26.240 --> 41:33.920]  and 20 off secret 12 vitamin b12 today only as well those specials are going to be ending now
[41:33.920 --> 41:41.680]  let me briefly tell you about the new product i've been so busy covering news and analysis that
[41:43.040 --> 41:48.160]  i haven't even done uh or finished a production of these informational videos and doctor group
[41:48.160 --> 41:51.680]  and others about biome defense but those will be out in the next few days and will be posted
[41:51.680 --> 41:57.200]  on the site but it's now available we've got a big cold room right here in the warehouse uh there's
[41:57.200 --> 42:01.280]  a big cold room where this is produced right here in the united states then it's shipped by refrigerated
[42:01.280 --> 42:08.240]  truck here then we send a cold pack uh with it because these these strains stay alive in room
[42:08.240 --> 42:13.040]  temperature for a while but they really retain their power if you keep them cool and let me just
[42:13.040 --> 42:18.000]  tell you something and that's why i'm so excited about this to get these strains most people go to
[42:18.000 --> 42:25.760]  doctors or they go to the cold case that places like Whole Foods and pay 100 or more dollars we're
[42:25.760 --> 42:37.600]  going to put biome defense back on screen for everybody it's 69 95 similar formulas are 100
[42:37.600 --> 42:44.720]  dollars or more these strains are extremely expensive these are the widest spectrum the highest
[42:44.720 --> 42:52.400]  quality these are the strains associated with true healthy gut flora this is what i and my family
[42:53.360 --> 42:59.040]  take and by the way obviously if i've got close to 30 products that have taken us four years to
[42:59.040 --> 43:04.160]  develop some of them are private label from top names but a lot of it we've developed ourselves
[43:04.160 --> 43:08.560]  with some of the top scientists and researchers out there that's why they're so popular even outside
[43:08.560 --> 43:12.560]  of info wars uh with the big nutraceutical sites and other places and probably have such great
[43:12.560 --> 43:20.000]  reviews because they're that good we could have easily private labeled hundreds of different
[43:20.000 --> 43:26.400]  probiotics that are good for you overall and you know do a great job but we waited this is seven
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.160]  years of development group was developing this years before we even worked with him we're working
[43:30.160 --> 43:38.400]  with him almost five years and it is over the top quality over the top quality biome defense by
[43:38.400 --> 43:44.880]  info wars life is a superior blend of 50 50 billion excuse me 50 billion live and active cultures
[43:44.880 --> 43:50.000]  from 23 different probiotic strains which are known to support digestion and intestinal function
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.520]  everybody knows it's a lot more than just that they've got mainline you know washington post
[43:55.520 --> 43:59.760]  articles speaking of the devil or they're even being enforced to admit that gut having a dead
[43:59.760 --> 44:04.160]  gut is actually the newark times uh you know not having any good flora in it is one of the most
[44:04.160 --> 44:09.680]  dangerous things you can do for your body uh your brain is all connected to your gut uh it's amazing
[44:09.680 --> 44:15.040]  information amazing research biome defense by info wars life is a superior blend the experts
[44:15.040 --> 44:18.960]  agree that the gut health plays a huge role in normal function of your immune system and is
[44:18.960 --> 44:25.600]  essential for optimum health your gut is home to over 100 million neurons brain nano transmitters
[44:25.600 --> 44:29.760]  and is often called your second brain because of the direct link between the brain and that is
[44:29.760 --> 44:41.280]  digestive system info wars life dot com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and your purchase of this
[44:42.720 --> 44:49.120]  funds our operation and everything we do here and then we'll put it back up there on screen
[44:49.120 --> 44:57.200]  for folks it's 60 capsules it's filled to the brim and again similar formulas that aren't even as good
[44:57.200 --> 45:03.200]  or quite frankly 200 300 400 dollars in some cases ridiculous uh but we were looking into this we had
[45:03.200 --> 45:09.920]  to pay i'm gonna have group on next week about this we had to pay sometimes just to buy the strain
[45:10.960 --> 45:16.320]  and then to be able to reproduce it at other labs 50 000 dollars a strain and stuff like that i mean
[45:16.320 --> 45:20.960]  this is ridiculous so that's why so many other companies just kind of put run-of-the-mill stuff
[45:20.960 --> 45:26.400]  in there and reportedly the older the strain the better some of these strains can be backed tens
[45:26.400 --> 45:33.600]  of thousands of years he's coming on the show uh to explain it all but it is amazing we came out with
[45:33.600 --> 45:40.480]  the very best thing we could evidence by five years of info wars life coming up in a couple
[45:40.480 --> 45:45.520]  months notice never had a probiotic could add one anytime i wanted to i could have a line of 500
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.440]  products right now probably have made more money not going to do it we are going to bring you the
[45:49.440 --> 45:53.600]  very very best now there are some staples out there that are really already over the top the
[45:53.600 --> 45:59.200]  best you're going to get and so we go with those i mean take our colloidal silver what the what we
[45:59.200 --> 46:02.880]  have is from the biggest producer in the country it's what whole food sells for 25 dollars we sell
[46:02.880 --> 46:08.000]  for 1995 it's private label the exact same thing it's what the government says they'll allow 30
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.240]  parts per million from the best lab out there some could argue that more parts per million is good
[46:12.240 --> 46:15.920]  or whatever but some argue it's toxic whatever we just go with what is believed is the very best
[46:15.920 --> 46:21.120]  out there and it's less expensive 1995 that's just an example of what we do okay i'm done talking
[46:21.120 --> 46:25.760]  about it thank you for supporting the broadcast that's how we do this it's how we have 24-hour
[46:25.760 --> 46:32.160]  broadcast it's how we have documentaries and films it's how we continually get in the globalist
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.600]  face and continually are able to have reporters around the country doing amazing things i mean
[46:37.600 --> 46:42.720]  there isn't a better place to support out there in my view and more and more of the commenters
[46:42.720 --> 46:46.400]  on info wars get this when they were reading articles today about how they want to censor
[46:46.400 --> 46:51.120]  the free press and how they want to censor you know folks who are speaking out against tyranny
[46:52.320 --> 46:57.120]  the commenters were saying man it's time to really not have any business with the establishment
[46:57.120 --> 47:03.920]  they're out to get us absolutely and it's time to really support organizations and outlets
[47:04.560 --> 47:08.560]  that do tell the truth i mean look how much drudge is done for everybody boosting the new
[47:08.560 --> 47:13.760]  media breaking through the electronic Berlin wall nine times out of ten when nobody else can
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.280]  and game changing changing the talking points to real issues and you have the federal elections
[47:19.280 --> 47:23.440]  commission saying they openly want to shut drudge down that that means everybody else i mean in five
[47:23.440 --> 47:28.720]  days they hand the internet over to the united nations doesn't mean they're going to shut it
[47:28.720 --> 47:35.840]  off next week but the transfer is happening and notice the censorship is coming in like a flood
[47:38.240 --> 47:43.280]  when you're on a site like drudge click on the sponsors because that's what it's all about ladies
[47:43.280 --> 47:47.040]  and gentlemen they want to shut off our economy to control us now look at these headlines
[47:49.680 --> 47:55.760]  video liberals signed petition to jail donald trump for hate crimes now we went out in austin
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.880]  to liberal areas and only half the people and and i'm glad i'm glad that only half of them
[48:00.880 --> 48:07.600]  you know thought that that obama was setting aside national parkland in florida uh for dinosaurs
[48:07.600 --> 48:14.720]  okay we don't go do this to make fun of people we do this to show how dangerous these people are
[48:14.720 --> 48:18.880]  in their ignorance but that's still scary half of them thinking that you know the uh
[48:20.080 --> 48:25.680]  plesiosaur was still alive the people should lose their private property for it in the case of mark
[48:25.680 --> 48:31.040]  dies it's always nine out of ten and this is unedited by unedited he he puts it all the people
[48:31.040 --> 48:39.520]  he i mean if he finds somebody that knows that the trump sons are not hunting triceratops he
[48:39.520 --> 48:46.960]  puts them in the report we're not picking and choosing here but this goes to the danger of
[48:46.960 --> 48:51.040]  these people because i'm going to play this clip when we come back from break but let me just set
[48:51.040 --> 48:56.160]  it up with some of these articles first wal-mart apologizes for refusing to make police officers

[49:06.960 --> 49:11.840]  now anything blue or police you see is racist wal-mart is apologizing for using to make a
[49:11.840 --> 49:16.000]  police officer's retirement cake last week after an employee told the cops daughter that the thin
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.120]  blue line cake design might be considered racist see this is what you learn in america now is how
[49:21.120 --> 49:28.240]  you refuse service to everybody because you just make up that that that it's offensive to you that's
[49:28.240 --> 49:32.800]  how you bring a country down is creating unmitigated infighting total mental illness let's continue

[55:46.400 --> 55:51.200]  also noted that there are stereotypes that surround this animal and therefore its inclusion

[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.360]  i mean this it's only going to get worse folks what you think white people only ones that can be
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.360]  racist this is a social control system they are impregnating implanting the the quote minorities
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:33.360]  they can get to in public schools to be total racist mental patients i mean this is mega insane
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.960]  folks and this will also then cause whites many of them to revert to tribalism which is what they
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.920]  call racism and then we're all controlled let's go to part of mark dice's report we're liberal
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.800]  sign petition to jail donald trump for hate crimes that's what they say here this is part of hate crime

[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.680]  after you and it's weird i used to have blonde hair it's as i got older it turned brown which is
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.720]  fine i kind of like my brown i think it's more masculine but but the point is is that this is
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.440]  almost like Titian it's like brown reddish blonde as they call it Titian but i mean you know give me
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.640]  a break man oh my gosh i've actually many times had black people in dallas but also an awesome

[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.080]  eyes and green eyes you have better light gathering uh but that's what happens when you're from the
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.800]  north pole bro but the point is is that you know a fox with blue eyes from the north pole
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:50.960]  isn't evil just because a fox from say you know uh the equator has brown eyes or or hazel eyes

[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:07.280]  and he will put the people in whether they say things that are stupid or whether they say things
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:15.440]  that are informed to illustrate the fact that this is what the education system and the mainstream
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.640]  media have done in this country and if you listen to these people they're so authoritarian they're
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.200]  so totalitarian they're so brutal they're like i don't just want donald trump in prison i want him
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:34.160]  dead i want that effort gone and it's the soft stupid people i don't care if they're white or
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:42.400]  black they can hardly talk and there's this new type of creature i see in downtown austin
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.760]  and i don't care if somebody what their sexual preference is i i don't hate anybody
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:56.240]  but the point is they try to force whatever their weird liberal trendy culture is on you
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.720]  and it's just super uncool and i go in these restaurants now that i've gone in for years
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.120]  and it's like everybody's upset they're not happy you can't tell if it's a man a woman
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.640]  it's like the cool thing is for a woman to get as fat as possible and then have facial hair
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.360]  i don't know what these creatures are i don't know what's happening okay but things are falling
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:24.960]  apart and look it's one thing if you go in a restaurant and there's one of these creatures
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:30.080]  but it's like all these creatures are taking over and they they hate you they hate your kids
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:38.320]  they hate your family they hate your good-looking wife they hate prosperity they love evil they're
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:46.000]  very stupid and it's like i don't know man it's like they can be black white or hispanic they
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:55.120]  all look the same it's weird i mean it's like i'm not against lesbians but what's up with
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:02.560]  the mullet never going out of style i mean why do they all look like rachel madow but now there's
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:09.200]  a new creature and i'm just saying what's going on here i mean what's in the water what's in the
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:16.400]  food and then why do these people want to kill us why do they lie so much and again these are victims
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.840]  of the system who bought into it it didn't fulfill them and now they think everything else
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.680]  that doesn't comply with their worldview is the reason they're not in valhalla
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.760]  and again i'm just singling out that weird phenomenon because buckley and i were talking
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.720]  about it just the other day
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.800]  you know you got the sports heads phenomenon of the want to be tough guys they'll start
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.280]  fights with you for no reason a parking lot but won't stand up for their country you know what's up
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:52.320]  with that i mean look look there's a lot to criticize myself about as well none of us are
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.200]  perfect i'm just saying i don't like gangs of people people that get into gang mentality people
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:03.520]  that get into weird little subcultures and that's what the globalists are setting up is a system
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:10.400]  of a bunch of divided and conquered fools and there's hundreds of these videos and we've done
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.920]  these two and gotten similar results were and we're gonna put gun owners in forced labor camps please
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.000]  sign here oh absolutely i'm so sick of these gun owners i want to i want to put them in prison
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:29.120]  they just have this lust that they could be fulfilled if the state would just go out and take over
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.960]  mob mentality the brain suppresses personal moral code when it gets into groups absolutely
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.400]  that's why hitler would have nighttime rallies with fire but they have sports events at night
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.720]  and all of this is being manipulated and all i'm asking people to be aware of
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.000]  is the fact this is ongoing you can make whatever decision you want but there is social
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.800]  engineering going on i did read 20 years ago in scientific publications that they were planning
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.560]  nobody being allowed to drive your own cars in the future what job you have been controlled
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:09.600]  how many kids you have been controlled as a means to an end to phase us out and now i've got a stack
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.200]  of articles from the new york times to the daily mail saying you will not be in your car soon
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.960]  the feds have decided and globally federal governments have decided i mean our lives
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.520]  are all being decided for us is what i'm saying and they admit they're deciding them for us and
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.920]  then i say look here they are admitting they're deciding our world for us and having secret
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.960]  agreements you know they even say hillary clinton needs to talk about what she stands for
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.480]  that that no one really knows what she stands for and then tim cane her vp came out so well she
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:47.840]  stands for treating people good and not not just thinking about herself that's the opposite hillary
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:53.280]  clinton and i've interviewed two different secret service agents that work for i've interviewed
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:14:00.080]  an fbi agent that worked with her i've interviewed state police from the day that the clintons were
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:06.640]  known running for office in arkansas the clintons especially hillary do not give you a tip
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.720]  if you look them in the eyes they will still tell you how dare you look at me in the eyes if
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:20.000]  they're in the camera around they are the most empty horrible selfish demonic people you could
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.720]  ever imagine what's known about trump going back 30 years ridiculously huge tips now if you give him
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.200]  bad service sugar the manager's gonna be called over and we shoot out uh hiring minorities and
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.480]  women unlike anybody ever has and promoting them off of who gets the job done in loyalty
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.320]  genuine real hard-working compassionate caring but tough you attack donald trump he's gonna attack
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.400]  you right back that's a male attribute to be loving and good unless you have to defend your family
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:56.560]  but my point is hillary is a monster what does she stand for foreign secret trade deals narcotics
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:03.440]  trafficking evil wars funding radical islam lecturing everyone on what words you can use being
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:08.240]  so arrogant she knows she's got serious health issues and she's still trying to be president
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:14.400]  even though it's killing her let's go to mark dice liberal side petition to jail donald trump
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:21.440]  listen to the sycophantic evil in these people's voices we help us indict donald trump on hate
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:27.840]  crimes charges we hate that man we are petitioning loretta lynch attorney general to imprison him for
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:34.240]  10 years for hate speech i don't think that's gonna work well if that'll silence him but
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:41.200]  wouldn't you agree that anything that we can do by any means necessary to silence him you're right
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.600]  thank you so much we'll get him in jail here soon enough one more signature for you i don't

[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:06.240]  said she wants to arrest people for speech does this guy think he has a first amendment or what
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:12.560]  to in today's new world order you really think we're gonna be tolerating people those aren't men
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.600]  look at them people like hillary i don't think so for petitioning the and by the way the point
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:22.560]  about these creatures they're asexual that run all the restaurants but we still need a few more
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.000]  six they only hire their own is my point too a reasonable testimony they're discriminatory

[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:27.040]  worldwide i'm your host Alex Jones i'm gonna open the phones up the next segment on the debate
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.560]  tonight what do you think's gonna happen what do you think trump should do how will the media try
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.400]  to spin things uh if trump comes out and basically goes after hillary for all of her crimes they're
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:42.240]  gonna demonize that like he's picking on a woman but wait a minute that's using chivalry women didn't
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:48.880]  used to be in combat generally or in executive roles like this because people wouldn't stand for a
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:57.120]  woman being called names being attacked but now she's in this world so she's fair game plus she's
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:04.000]  not your little old average grandma she's a war criminal she's a horrible person i think trump
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.200]  should point out hey normally i'm very very nice to ladies but quite frankly i don't consider you
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:14.240]  to be one because of your record and she can't stop in 15 minutes and i just run through libya
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:21.120]  and syria and the cattle futures and the corruption and the ben gazi stand down and just crime
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:26.560]  and lying about the servers and everything else and so i'd say stop hiding behind the fact that
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.840]  you're a woman stop using that just like we know about these women that are con artists
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.960]  and then and then use that to basically carry out their crimes he needs to go ahead and take her
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:44.560]  quote strength and make it her weakness but you know that's probably not even the best attack
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.280]  it's i think it would work i think he should go after her because the truth is such a big palette
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:55.520]  there's so many you know areas to go into here with coming out and saying who is hillary clinton
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:00.000]  you've act like the fact that i've built hotels and golf courses and businesses and have done all
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.120]  this is a bad thing you've been in washington for 20 something years you've been in politics for 40
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.640]  something years and you are the architects of the end of glass deagle and the banking collapse
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:16.160]  you are the architect of the dollar devaluation you are the architect of so much of what we're under
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:24.320]  right now and then you sit here and you say that we need you for a change no it's time to do something
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:30.160]  different you're on the payroll the communist chinese you admittedly it's come out in the
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.760]  wikileaks documents get millions of dollars basically from the chinese government you should
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:41.360]  be indicted you're a criminal you're a spy and you know what the rozenbergs one of them was a woman
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:50.080]  and they still went to the electric chair see that's how you lay it out you say listen i don't
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.480]  like seeing women get thrown in prison but quite frankly it doesn't matter a lot of women end up
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:59.520]  getting the death penalty hillary over the crimes you've committed and the treason you've been involved
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:06.560]  in you need to be indicted for treason that's what i'd tell her it will destroy her and the
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:13.040]  mainstream media on the spot i would quadruple and then quadruple and then quadruple and then
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:26.000]  quadruple down again with just absolute devastation on her because it's the truth i would let her have
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.400]  it with everything and say hillary i'd like to let up on you because you're so ill but you lie to
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.320]  the american people about it so we're gonna talk about it i'd love to let up on you hillary but
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.880]  you didn't let up on the millions of taxpayers that under your rules and the rules that your
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.480]  system put in have persecuted and taken little old ladies houses across this nation and taken
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:52.800]  little old ladies bank accounts who'd committed no crimes here's the new york times a lady who
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:28:02.320]  for 40 years ran her five table mexican food restaurant that just had four or five little
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:07.680]  stools up front no more 10 people could eat there and the iris took everything out of her bank
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:13.680]  account her 35 000 the savings under some irs rule the democrats approved you're the bully of old
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:21.440]  ladies i mean i would just come after her on every front for the portion of the debate that
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:28.400]  trump will be in control of the reportedly going for big 15 minute chunks but on different subjects
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.320]  and they're going to have zinger questions they're going to come after trump with a lepo questions
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.320]  i said this before gary johnson stuck his foot in his mouth i said they're going to have zinger
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.800]  military questions that that they'll blow up and make a big deal out of if trump doesn't know if they
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:51.760]  say something like well in fact i remember even saying something like a lepo like what do you
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.560]  think of the city of a lepo what should be done there and then if trump doesn't know it's the main
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:04.080]  battleground glenengrad of this war then they're like oh my gosh you didn't know that but that's
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:13.840]  the no brainer question to ask what's another one um president obama's red line what would you do with
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:19.040]  red lines and if trump doesn't know what the red line was three years ago was syria then the one
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:24.640]  year anniversary the nerve gas attack if he doesn't know that then the oh oh oh we didn't know that
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.200]  as if any president would really know that it's the generals and people that you have that have
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:34.160]  the track record that you then get advised by or as president should know that presidents until recent
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.000]  times would know that but now they're too busy playing golf constantly toll free number to join

[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.520]  russia is pointing out there won't be any peace in syria as long as the obama administration
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.920]  keeps sending weapons to the ices linked out in those front russian government said the militants
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:15.600]  are armed by tanks apcs filled artillery multiple rocket launchers and heavy weaponry and of course
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.360]  they could have made these weapons themselves nor could they have stolen all of them from the syrian
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:23.920]  army especially not the american made tow missiles that jihadi's used to destroy a russian helicopter
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.880]  last year russians also pointed out that the u.s led airstrike that killed 62 syrian soldiers has
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:34.160]  directly led to ices gaining ground in other words the u.s just served as ices's air force the u.s
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.560]  state department has claimed the attack was an accident however fax points to the contrary the
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.640]  region where the attack occurred has always been under syrian army control with no prior presence
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:47.440]  of ices sent com even had the audacity to release a statement claiming they have not bombed the area

[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:35.920]  russia with syria we have the chairman of the joint jesus staff saying the orders he's been given
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.600]  to create a no fly zone will cause a war with russia and so he's seeking authorization from
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:46.640]  congress uh to follow that order and have war with russia we played that clip the last two days in
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:52.560]  a row it's not on us media because our media is so incredibly controlled the washam post has come
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:58.960]  out with a headline dear readers or dear victims please stop calling us the media there's no such
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.480]  thing incredibly arrogant story if you heard that you're welcome to chime in on it a parenting
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:10.640]  magazine one of the biggest in the world uh officially comes out uh and says that in baby and
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:16.160]  family that if you see blonde-haired blue-eyed people that are outgoing and nice and friendly
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:20.960]  you need to confront them if they're quote uh inconspicuous and cheerful and say i will not
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:28.400]  stand for your nazism for your xenophobia and to rebuke them uh meanwhile major university
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.000]  uh has come out and said that banned gorillas because they learned that they were doing a
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.120]  gorilla mural uh a jungle mural and they were told you will not do that because gorillas look like
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:50.160]  men and men are bad and seeing a man who is muscular might trigger a woman k u bars gorillas
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:59.360]  from jungle theme decoration cannot make this stuff up and it continues police officer cakes
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:05.200]  are banned because anything police has seen as racist by walmart uh they then apologize uh it goes on
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:11.440]  and on and on meanwhile police killed five white people the same day as keith scott and i you know
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:17.760]  i'm not going to play this clip again because we played it twice yesterday but you can clearly see
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:26.240]  that the black police officer after he's shot scott pulls out three gloves they're in his pouch
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.840]  because someone's been shot and one of the gloves falls on the ground and it's a glove
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:39.040]  you can see the cop other cop kick the gun away that was in scott's hand it's on video
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.720]  the guy had a criminal record he was on medication the cops are screaming over and over again drop
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:53.280]  the gun drop the gun but i i kept thinking why does black lives matter not pick the case of the
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:58.560]  innocent black man shot by the female cop in tulsa well because when it's open and shut the cop gets
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.480]  indicted she's been indicted for manslaughter they want to pick something that can be a big
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:09.200]  fight for a year and keep the rioting and the and the and the bs going that's why black lives
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:14.400]  matter and sorrows always pick some case where there's you know 30 witnesses that the black guy
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.960]  charges and attacks you know the white cop uh or the black cop shoots the black guy who's you
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:26.480]  know waving a gun around does that mean you don't run into bad cops absolutely the point is is that
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:31.760]  this is artificial this is in hillary's own emails and sorrows his own emails to create
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:39.200]  massive division and continuing washington post new york times lead trend of emphasizing race of
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:45.200]  white officer burying race of black officer fox news went further and it wasn't just a type of
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:51.040]  this was in a bunch of articles saying that a white officer in charlotte north carolina shot sky
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:57.280]  i mean this is getting crazy folks this is getting
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:03.280]  absolutely nuts and then we have the msnbc club where they go look that looks like the cops planted
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:09.680]  a gun and it's after they've shot them and you see the glove fall on the ground
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:24.560]  so it's getting absolutely crazy at this point uh let's go ahead and play a clip clip here of
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:33.360]  the vice presidential candidate uh coming out and talking about hillary is somebody
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:43.440]  that will not be a me first type of person when that's exactly who hillary is what can you tell
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:49.120]  voters other than trust us that hillary clinton's going to do to increase transparency and openness
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:58.480]  were she to become president well here's what i say um hillary has a long track record of service
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:04.720]  in public life and you can look at that i tell the story about her being first lady of the united
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:11.040]  states when the effort to get health care done failed and that was a tough tough loss but then it
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.840]  tested her as a leader and she worked together with democrats and republicans to get health
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.880]  insurance for eight million low-income american children in the chip program the measure of
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.760]  character in somebody in public life i think is whether they have a passion for somebody other
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:31.280]  than than themselves and whether they keep after that passion whether they're winning or losing
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.240]  hillary has demonstrated that again and again and i think that's a sharp contrast to a donald
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:42.400]  trump who's only recognized passion in his life has been for himself no great president of this
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:48.000]  country has been primarily a me first person okay great presidents or people who watch out for others
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.280]  and that's who hillary clinton has been that's who she is and that's who she'll be donald trump
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:39:00.560]  made his money by creating jobs and building buildings and creating industry and donald trump
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:06.480]  is known to give massive amounts of charity hillary clinton is a pig-like creature that gave
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:13.760]  5.7 percent of the charity money she raised for Haitians and others to the Haitians
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:22.240]  now the only person worse is bono bono who only gives 1.8 percent
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:28.720]  i mean imagine you put on a concert you raise hundreds of millions of dollars globally and
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:36.720]  then you keep 98 percent of it i mean these people are monsters but the left media covers for them so
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:42.240]  i want to do a video uh with clips of kane there a special report maybe i'll shoot it after the
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:48.000]  show today and have it for the debate coverage tonight where we've got kane saying that and
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.640]  then showing how the clintons don't give tips that's on record and don't give the money they get
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:40:00.320]  from charity to people this is monstrous and then they want kids in no child left behind and all this
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:05.600]  you know elementary school you know pre-elementary stuff so the state raises your kids i mean this
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:11.520]  is so sick but what did charlie rose even the globalist is leaving the singing ship he said how
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:20.320]  can clinton win trust with one debate after failing to do it in a lifetime she's a wooden robotic
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:26.640]  person that looks like she's wearing a plastic joker mask she looks like a halloween costume
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:34.880]  and i don't mean that because of her quote looks she's not a bad looking woman it's that whatever
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:43.360]  animates her is so joker like she's scary looking i mean i mean i can't even do the
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.560]  faces she makes it's weird we all know what i'm talking about and tonight she's gonna face
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.120]  donald trump i don't know how she's gonna do it maybe if they've pulled her off the campaign
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:57.440]  trail for a full week you know she's gonna have to stand on the strength but she was tottering
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:02.480]  when she went down the stairs this morning in new york stories on info wars.com it's on drudge
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:11.440]  hillary's instantaneous health morph unanticipated pull reporter surprises secretary clinton and
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.720]  then she suddenly oh i'm doing great after she kind of totals down the stairs but the bigger
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.040]  question is sick hillary wears heavy winter coat on warm afternoon that's another question
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:28.480]  now after i take some phone calls we've got a whole stack of news on the polls here over in
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:35.680]  ohio plunging campaign pulling plug on battleground state and our own millie weaver went undercover
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:41.360]  in cleveland into their main democrat facility and it's an interesting interview it's on info
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.320]  wars.com it's it's it's long but she's in there undercover talking to the head campaign people
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:50.800]  and they go yeah yeah most democrats we run into actually support trump it's really hard to find
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:57.840]  a body that likes her it's incredible and and millie's report is important but i think we
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:04.320]  should cut it down and reissue it with the headline democrats you know undercover tape
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:10.160]  democrats panic say they can't find any hillary supporters and that's what we've been finding
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:15.200]  she can't get crowds she has to go to other people's crowds most people are going to vote for
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:22.320]  sanders but she still stole it and i've noticed that fox news continues
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.760]  to have the worst polls against trump to show how they're good liberals now
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.200]  since they've had the coup over at fox oh they're still fox and friends they're still
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.680]  hanity they're still a little bit of old fox there which wasn't perfect but my god it was
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:45.120]  better than it is now you tune in now it is lip licking hatred i mean it is drooling anticipation
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:51.200]  and salivation to go after trump and every time we hear trumps behind in polls this morning
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:59.520]  trumps behind in polls even the twisted polls have him three points ahead he's 10 points ahead
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:07.520]  he's 15 points ahead that's what internal polling shows but quite frankly the trump people don't want
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:16.720]  folks to be too satisfied and go to sleep because they know they're facing fraud dead people voting
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:23.440]  in colorado all over the country it's coming out we're hillary's behind and so he knows he needs a
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.760]  tsunami a really big win for them not to be able to steal it because believe me they're doing it
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.600]  they're bringing in the globalists they're bringing in the un they're bringing in the eu to oversee
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:38.400]  elections when they said there's no such thing as election fraud remember that but we forced the issue
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:47.200]  so that's all coming up trump clinton deadlocked in bloomberg poll before key debate bloomberg
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.160]  admittedly in many other polls samples five percent more democrats than republicans and
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:56.160]  then when they call it independent samples those are mainly democrats so they do the same thing
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:01.760]  uh that roiders got caught doing and by the way roiders had to back off that because there
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:05.920]  was such a backlash see they'll try anything oh actually the popular vote doesn't count in
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:09.680]  the primary oh yeah we're not putting up with it okay it does count oh actually we're going to
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:14.960]  sample 15 points more in roiders polls of democrats well that's total fraud you're discredited okay
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:20.160]  we're going to stop that now they just do other more sneaky stuff like the again the independent
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:24.240]  sample from experts have been talking to that's where they're doing the cheating now this is
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:31.920]  how they operate so yes trump has the ace card of populism rising nationalism americanism versus
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.160]  globalism that's what this debate is all about tonight as of your seat ladies and gentlemen
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.520]  but as i prepare to go to your calls please remember you are the front lines of the info
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:47.840]  war that means you are the blood you are the guts you are the sinew you are the muscle you are the
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.600]  bone you are the brains you are the eyes you are the nose you are the ears you are the feet on the
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:45:00.320]  ground you are the men and men and women no matter what color you are the greatest coup they've had
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:07.040]  was ron paul started a populist movement info wars listeners did 10 years ago
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.120]  when he was first running for president again and then eight years ago
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:18.240]  and it was called the tea party and we would throw the 9-11 commission report in the water
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:23.200]  here in austin and in boston you name it and and and not say that bush blew it up but say
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.480]  the soddies were involved our government stood down and we would say we hate the republicans we
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.640]  hate the democrats we're anti-war but we're not liberals and we're building a movement to take
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:34.960]  america back that thing game game game had like 23 30 000 people showing up in the bench
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:41.040]  the republicans were getting attacked eight years ago right after obama got elected by the
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.120]  tea party so were democrats and they came in and tried to take it over as the populist movement
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:49.840]  they were somewhat successful they thought they were but instead that was the libertarian movement
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:54.880]  and the patriot movement taking over a beachhead in the republican party and you're seeing a
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:01.840]  gigantic manifestation of that right now called donald j trump so when loser draw we win by being
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:11.280]  engaged now we've got to go next level info wars dot com articles info wars dot com videos info

[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:04.000]  at all sides of her and we're not going away she says they're losing the info war who do you think
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.960]  they're talking about ladies and gentlemen who thought to even call it an info war because i
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.920]  went and read their own psychological manuals that were declassified how they were going to
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:18.800]  run an info war on us and i said let's run an info war on them but instead of firing lies let's fire

[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:52.880]  us off first we have to build up our own platforms i have to get millions of people to tune into our
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:59.280]  own video streams run some ads on there and war game whether or not i can pay for the bandwidth
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.320]  i mean this is all testing to see next level if we can supplant the mainstream media which
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  were already done they already know that but we want to truly dominate them by numbers of you
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:16.560]  know 10 times we want to go to that next level that no one else has achieved but say a matt drudge
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:24.080]  who has more traffic than the facebook and uh new york times when it comes to news combined
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:30.640]  we need video we need audio we need a news organization that is at that same level and
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:35.040]  that's what we're trying to build here and trying to do because i want to defeat the new world order
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.480]  and because we've had pure hearts and been wanting to do it for the right reason we've had great success

[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:10.000]  now i know why it seemed like all the pins were leaking and not just that particular brand
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.120]  which i'm sure is a great pin earlier last hour when i thought a pin blew up in my face and i
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:21.760]  thought one blew up last week a pin had blown up at the bottom of my alamo cup that i bought up the
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:27.520]  alamo i shall never surrender or retreat victory or death william barrett travis
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:36.000]  and there was a blown pin at the bottom that's why all the pins were suddenly leaking so i guess
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:41.360]  the precise v5 rt is not bad unless it was one of those that actually blew up a little side issue
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:46.080]  i don't know why i'm getting off into that but it's important information can i tell you about
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:51.360]  colonel travis a little bit no i think i'll think i'll just leave all that alone i could write a
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:56.000]  book sometime though all the family lore and stuff but it sounds like bragging so i'm gonna do it
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.960]  i'm gonna stop right there let's just let's just my people just about the stuff going back to
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.440]  england and the welsh and all that oh my gosh but everybody's got great family histories i know
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:09.120]  that's why the globalists want us to forget our histories and forget where we came from
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:14.000]  because they are putting us into a future that is built on treachery they don't want you know
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.880]  what your ancestors did ladies and gentlemen we're gonna go to cori uh sarah steven allen
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:23.760]  and chris right now what are these going to happen with the debate tonight sarah from florida go ahead
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:34.160]  hello yes ma'am hi how are you good good um well uh i guess i should start off with the fact that
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:41.360]  my daughter and i um we marched for bernie at the dmc and basically um we're really scared
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:48.320]  about this election we're really scared about our choices and one of the things that i personally
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:53.200]  have you know developed as an opinion i really think that these candidates are the same they
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:58.720]  just have a different way of putting things um it's gotten to the point of where i don't trust
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:04.720]  our government or our media anymore um it has scared the hell out of me um my oldest daughter
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:11.440]  went to the dnc was the youngest one marching on her own uh she's the one that wanted to go she's
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:16.880]  published in rollingstone magazine and many other media outlets that interviewed her were blown away
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:22.240]  by how much she knew on her own as a 14 year old and this was from all different parties because we
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:28.000]  are actually truly independent we both let me ask you this what do you make of the fact that
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  even stanford university did a study their professors and then computers he he he wasn't
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.840]  just robbed by the super delegates he won 11 states they took he was by a huge margin the real
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.640]  nominee i mean how could you not vote for trump because you're saying that they're all the same
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:51.200]  trump is against nafta and gath and and china has all these unfair uh internal tariffs uh on their
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:56.160]  currency and on their their federal taxes and on their corporate taxes where we can't compete
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:04.560]  um and again like i am independent and i against trump i'm not against um i am they're not the
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:10.080]  same listen china has a lower corporate tax than us you know what that means it the corporations
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.720]  wrote it like that in the us because they wanted to go to china it means they won't base themselves
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:22.480]  here because we have the highest tax in the world okay but then again we need to look at the fact that
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:28.720]  china is one of the places that is on trump product label trump trump well actually it's
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:34.080]  mexico and he's been totally honest he said listen people won't buy a tie that costs 100 bucks
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:38.800]  but they will buy one that's 50 bucks and i pay 20 bucks to get made in mexico
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:43.280]  as soon as we change things i'm gonna build stuff here a lot of what he does build is here
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:49.920]  he's been totally i get stuff made in mexico i'm about making our country more powerful
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:58:00.240]  and reliant on itself like he does preach and it's just i like i said to um a lot of people
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:05.040]  you know there's a lot of stubborn going on um no i hear you listen listen i've got to jump
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.640]  i'm gonna come back and work all the 70 seconds sarah and i understand it is a dangerous scary time
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:14.560]  the whole power structure the internal emails bohemian grove the whole elite hate trump foreign
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:20.240]  leaders the communist chinese president the saudi arabians believe me trump is the guy he's for
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:24.320]  real it's why they're so scared we'll be right back on the other side of this break stay with us

[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:34.640]  seven hours out from the official 90 minute debate held at a university in the state of new york
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:39.280]  we're going to have live coverage really for two hours before we're going to have
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:42.400]  some right side links where we're working with them son with some of their reporters some of our
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:47.680]  reporters are going to be on the ground mr shawyer and others we are going to have again
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:52.640]  their analysis starting at six actually we've been saying seven o'clock but my reporters are
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:57.280]  traveling at the bed and then at seven we're going to have myself leon macadoo and others
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:02.400]  darin mcbreen uh david night breaking down things and then we're going to obviously carry the debate
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:10.000]  i'm going to analyze mainstream media response to it but i'll try to limit my analysis to some
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:16.400]  of the shorter periods during applause or any short breaks or obviously if hillary collapses
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.680]  there are no breaks they will not turn the mics off she can't go to the bathroom for 10 minutes
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:27.440]  and just disappear and kind of just you know press or stop watch and stop time space continuum
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:32.400]  um this is going to be huge uh and you know what i wasn't thinking let's put a poll up on info wars
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:36.720]  dot com we've also got twitter and facebook polls we don't ever that's one thing we're dropping the
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:41.760]  ball on here in info wars because we don't have a big enough crew folks uh is that we need to have
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:47.520]  daily polls that we really promote not to stick at the bottom of info wars where we ask and the
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:53.200]  questions a will hillary make the debate or cancel will hillary cancel the debate question mark
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:58.240]  he's going right now number two will she have a coughing fit number three will she collapse number
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:04.160]  four will she sail through it with flying colors there's your questions i think that's a very important
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:09.680]  poll i want to put it front and center on info wars dot com i'm not going to tell drudges business
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:12.720]  but i think that's a pretty important poll and they say how dare he have been ply she would fall
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:20.000]  down well i mean she can't even do events so let's put that poll up front and center poll
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.880]  will hillary make tonight's debate and then put the poll under it and some of our articles
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:31.200]  where she's collapsed under it quarry in texas you say new wiki leaks hacked election um what's
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:37.120]  your point on that yeah i mean first time long time i'm here in austin the heart of the resistance
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.480]  and uh just wanted your thoughts on the next wiki leaks release i know his son chad hinted on
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:47.200]  hanity and the kelly file that was going to release the new docs before the first debate
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:51.200]  he even applied he was going to he said that four weeks ago he said that three weeks ago
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:56.960]  then he said more coming in a week probably and now we've seen nothing yeah so we scour kind of
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:00.960]  like the internet daily kind of waiting for the news to drop with uh with nothing didn't know if
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:06.160]  you thought this was uh maybe a tactic to release them later on because the american voter might be
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:12.240]  too short minded to really you know keep sure well here's the problem he should have released
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:18.480]  them say last thursday friday's a bad day but say last thursday or sunday morning people think
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.080]  that's a bad time i've found friday nights are the worst time that's why they bury stuff there
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:26.880]  but sunday there's not a lot of reporters doing news there is less people tuning into news but
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:31.280]  there's still less news so i found one of the best times to release something is sunday morning
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:37.840]  personally uh but if i was him ahead of the debate i would have released it sometime last week to
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:42.720]  give folks plenty of time to look at it to go over it to discover what's there to give trump
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:47.600]  time to bring it up or i would have brought it out say on a sunday but had a limited release
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:52.560]  of only key documents uh to to you know try to get that narrative out uh or maybe he's waiting
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:57.520]  until after the debate maybe he's waiting to sucker puncher with bombshells an hour before
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:04.080]  who knows but we'll all know in seven hours my friend won't we right well we're tuning in at
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:09.280]  seven uh central time to your uh your early broadcast well god bless you and please send
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.880]  the link out info wars dot com forward slash show because we've got a whole bunch of different
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.560]  feeds we've gone out licensed and a bunch of different ways to carry it but i'm mainly still
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:22.080]  going to be playing clips and live feeds off mainstream news so i'm going to be watching
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.800]  what they do watching what then i've got the whole team uh is going to be on this so thank you so
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:31.280]  much uh cori what do your guts tell you will she make it will she have a coughing fit will she
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:36.560]  collapse or will she get a you know safe sale well i thought about i'm pretty sure she's
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:40.000]  going to make the debate only because if she was going to drop out she probably would use
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.480]  some use over the weekend or the past week to kind of weasel her way out i agree i think she
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:48.640]  will definitely be at the debate but i think that we will definitely see some weaknesses in her health
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:53.600]  it could be coughing fit it could just be hopefully a total collapse just so we can kind of like
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:57.120]  get to the root but it shows how many she's definitely got big old wavos i mean she's going
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:04.080]  for it great points i agree with you tonight tune into info wars dot com four slash shows starting
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:08.320]  at seven p.m central for live coverage of the presidential debate between donald trump and
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:13.200]  hillary clinton it's the first major debate of the election it's 90 minutes long we're airing it in

[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:21.360]  to help you separate the truth from the false narrative the mainstream media wants you to
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:25.200]  believe will hillary even make it through the night or will she collapse on stage due to her
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:29.360]  failing health it's going to be a rough night for hillary for example the presidential debate
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:33.760]  commission denied hillary her request for a step stool at her podium according to the dredge report
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:38.080]  and as info wars reported in august hillary cannot even give a long speech without having
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:43.360]  a step stool or a secret service agent to lean on for support and info wars dot com has learned
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:47.600]  that influential democrats will pressure hillary to drop out of the race if she has a bad showing

[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:53.360]  the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival

[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:28.240]  of globalism the uk pulling back from briggs and now the united states on the verge of dealing
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:39.360]  what the globalist called a death blow to the new world in the enemy's own words globalism
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:46.960]  stands on the verge of collapse they've now repackaged their technocracy as the liberal
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:53.120]  world government obama said we must give up our sovereignty last week that americans are basically
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:57.600]  bad people that won't listen to him just like he told africans you have to be poor
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:07.440]  so that he can be rich they want total control the evil is simply astounding did i get to the
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:13.120]  charlie rose clipper not just talk about the charlie rose clip we need to play it this is charlie
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:19.280]  rose says how can clinton win trust with one debate after failing to do it with a lifetime
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:24.720]  this is cbs here's charlie rose actually telling the truth i mean i'm seeing big wigs desert her
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:31.760]  folks they know she's got reportedly a brain tumor she's having convulsions every 20 30 minutes i mean
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:37.280]  this is crazy they are deserting her they know he's way ahead so now they say that he's neck and
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:41.600]  neck no he's way ahead we're going to talk to paul watson here in just a moment your phone calls as
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:47.600]  well while paul watson rides shotgun with us but here is that clip from charlie rose you think she
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:52.960]  can change the trust dynamic in one debate when in fact she hadn't been able to do it over a lifetime
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:58.160]  or in terms of this campaign well the central question of this entire campaign is which one of
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:02.720]  these candidates is going to fight on the side of everyday people and it actually has plans that
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:07.920]  will make a difference in their lives can they can can voters trust a candidate to get that done
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:13.600]  and they can absolutely trust hillary she has a lifetime record on both sides of the aisle
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.440]  bringing people together and getting real things okay that's not edited or just computer how to
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:28.560]  glitch does that so we're sitting there listening to that crap and and hillary you can trust her
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:39.120]  this is a woman that took 94.3 percent of the Haitian money and and all the other foundation
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:49.280]  money and kept it and then it turned out her charitable giving 97 percent is to herself
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:53.520]  to make it tax exempt i remember when i'm talking to tax lawyers years ago
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:59.200]  and they were explaining to me how i would how i could do something like that and i said i'm not
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:04.160]  gonna do that that just doesn't sound right but that's what these folks do on a big scale
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:09.840]  is you like set up trust and then you give them money and you give it back to yourself i mean
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:14.720]  it's such a joke but it's one thing if she gives her money into a trust and then back to herself
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:20.480]  in a scam that's bad enough when she's running around saying raise taxes on everybody she goes
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:26.160]  out and does the Haitian relief and raises hundreds of millions and then kept half the
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.480]  money off the top to run the jet airplanes and the hotels and the staff and then of the other
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:36.000]  money that was supposed to be given to people she kept 90 plus percent of it there it is 96
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.040]  percent of hillary's charitable donations in 2015 went to clinton foundation i was going from memory
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:47.920]  there but do the math uh then if you look at what she did with the Haiti situation you can
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:56.880]  actually google it she gave 5.7 percent wow whoa i mean gotta lock people up for that man we ought
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:02.080]  to have laws where if you don't give the vast majority of the money and you're got some big
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:08.240]  salary while you're doing charity what in the world and and then it's oh she cares about everybody
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:17.040]  she's a monster i've been watching her for 20 plus years i wish she was a good person i wish
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:23.040]  things weren't so bad you think i want to go up against this killer the clinton's Haiti screw up
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:30.000]  as told by hillary's emails oh politico and others they didn't mean to keep all the money for themselves
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.800]  and they didn't mean to to pass minimum sentencing show the black persons caught with the same amount
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:40.160]  of cocaine as a white person they get five times as much time in prison literally and she said we're
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:49.120]  gonna teach these you know people how to heal like a dog she's a crazy person i'm gonna tell you
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:52.880]  who's crazy here's people that support her i mean and i heard that lady nicely calling my daughter
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:55.920]  and i are burning supporters and we don't know what to do because the candidates are both the same
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:01.360]  no they're not his military plan is completely different his tax plan is completely different
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:07.200]  let's go to paul joseph Watson and then to chris and steven and dana and uh diehard and eric and
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:12.000]  many others are holding what do you make of this narrative that hillary's this loving good person
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:17.440]  that loves everybody and wants to help everybody paul and then this narrative that trump is the
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:20.480]  same as hillary and that there's really no difference and now that's a new thing they're
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.960]  trying what do you make of this and what else is on your radar screen with october surprises
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:29.280]  what do you predicts coming up tonight we're putting the poll up on info wars.com will she
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:35.040]  still attend we still got seven hours for her to duck out six hours 45 minutes uh will she have a
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:40.800]  coughing fit will she collapse or will she make it through with flying colors paul Watson
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:47.440]  well i mean she didn't look too well yesterday i think she was wearing a heavy winter coat
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:52.880]  gingerly making her way down a small flight of stairs in you know 70 fahrenheit temperature
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:58.640]  quite a warm day in new york wearing this massive heavy green winter coat yet supposedly we were
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:06.480]  told she overheated just two weeks ago in new york so she didn't look too hot there with the debate
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:11.920]  i mean the media's already out doing damage control for hillary they fully expect her to lose
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:18.800]  we've got a cnn headline when romney trounced obama and it's basically a long story about how
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:24.720]  in that 2012 presidential debate romney completely crucified obama but that it didn't
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.520]  obviously have an effect on the eventual result so they're already getting their retaliation out
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:35.200]  ahead of time so it looks like they think hillary's gonna get beat quite bad tonight in this debate
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:41.200]  because all trump basically has to do is you know be quite reserved avoid her attacks avoid being
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:47.680]  baited and he's gonna win the debate so we've got that going on then we've got the rigging
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:52.960]  which is obviously the platforms which you've talked about making hillary look taller making
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:59.280]  her look more authoritative we've got the potential of mark cuban again vehemently pro hillary being
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:04.000]  in the front row you know they wouldn't do trump any favors would they that's the point so they're
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  already trying to rig it in hillary's favor so you've got all that going on then you've got the
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:16.880]  actual moderator of the debate lester hall of nbc news of course now you're remembering the
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:22.880]  previous debate the presidential forum which was kind of a debate in one sense but not in another
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:28.160]  they had matt lauher there and even though you know he asked trump probably double the amount
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:34.960]  of tough questions that he did hillary clinton he was absolutely savaged matt lauer of nbc
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:41.200]  for even asking hillary just a few hard questions exactly he got savaged because his body language
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.360]  because he knows donald trump for a long time as a good guy everybody knows that new york
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:49.920]  was not that i hate this guy he didn't have venom so even though he asked double the hard questions
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:55.360]  it wasn't good enough so yeah here's another question why why is nbc msnbc and now nbc
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:01.120]  why are they getting all the first debates go ahead paul well i mean it's a good question you've
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:06.160]  got fox news coming up later on but again you know we had we had this matt lauher situation
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:12.960]  we've got an army of leftists now trying to bully lester hall into quote fact checking
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:18.480]  donald trump on the fly during the debate which is completely impossible to begin with he's not
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:25.600]  a walking google search engine he can't accurately fact check anyone in the moment that's the job
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:30.320]  of the media to do after the debate by the way the the mainstream media is famous for bs fact
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:35.200]  checking i mean they claim hillary has no connection to isis when she's on record creating the damn thing
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:42.240]  no they're famous for it remain remember candy crowley in 2012 you know romney gets up and
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:48.480]  criticizes obama for claiming that he said ben gazi was an act of terror the day after the event
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:53.440]  we all know that's not true they lied about it for two weeks claimed it was a protest over a
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:17:01.120]  youtube video but romney called obama out on that in 2012 and cnn's candy crowley fact checked
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:06.720]  romney on the spot to make him look bad even though she was completely wrong she sided with
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:11.280]  obama but paul i don't have to listen to you because major children's publications and major
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:16.640]  family publications now say if someone has light hair or blue eyes that is inherently racist and
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:20.640]  evil and i should confront you right now so we're gonna put that article on screen we're not joking
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.960]  and i want to just say i don't have to listen to you you white piece of filth you're an effing white
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:30.720]  male and by the way we can't show gorillas uh in any type of murals it's now being announced
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:35.920]  that's up on info wars dot com because gorillas look like a man and a man that's muscular is
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:42.480]  threatening and is triggering me paul well and that was a big german magazine that came out
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:48.080]  with that article which is linked to the author of that article that you talked about she's
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:53.600]  a member of the same organization as that starzy member in germany who's working with facebook
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:59.200]  and twitter to send the germans to go after germans politically arrest them find them
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:04.080]  for speaking out against the migrant crisis and they actually say in that article parents who
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:10.880]  instill confidence in their children are dangerous and especially if they have blonde hair which is
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:16.160]  quite neat and well trimmed they're dangerous people for doing this if they're friendly and nice
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:21.600]  other quotes here uh if they're cheerful uh and and if they seem confident and if they just seem
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:27.840]  like you know kind of not making a big deal themselves yeah that that's bad but we need to accept
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:33.680]  i mean we had another example of it in the uk again six migrants spiker woman's drink in northern
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:38.720]  england abduct her rape her that's part of the cultural enrichment we're enjoying you've got a
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:43.920]  massive cover-up in sweden which has been going on for months these migrants in these no-go muslim
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:49.280]  ghettos which according to the left and the media don't exist that's a conspiracy theory even though
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:54.960]  we've been personally chased out of them they don't exist in sweden you've had cars being set on fire
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:19:02.240]  every single night for months and months you had a drive-by shooting you had explosions you had
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:08.320]  packages being found next to schools last night and there's basically no news about it it's being
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:14.080]  completely covered up same way soros is on record we have his emails he's proud of it he's public
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:19.360]  financing all this he just gave hundreds of millions more 500 million to help bring in more and do all
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:25.760]  this uh and then meanwhile fox news goes oh look george soros gave 500 million to help migrants
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:31.200]  no it's to bring more in it's to do all this even fox news is covering for george soros now
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:35.920]  then meanwhile 100 million from the ford foundation more money from him took to fund this stuff in
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:40.720]  charlotte i'm gonna skip this network break it's just too important we've got all this unfolding
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:46.400]  we've got all this happening we've got the same program we've got msnbc saying cops are planting
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:51.600]  guns when they clearly kick the gun away you see the gun on three different cameras and then the
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:57.040]  glove falls out of the black cop's pocket that shot the black guy with the gun and the media says
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:05.040]  it's them planting a gun i mean this is getting crazier and crazier and crazier when anybody can
[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:11.200]  see it's a glove falling out of his pocket uh i mean paul these people are revolutionaries
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:16.640]  but it's mega ultra rich trying to overthrow everything and have us fighting with each other
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:20.960]  they obviously don't want to empower the minorities it's the same mega rich that imploded the third
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:24.720]  world what is their end game because i gotta be honest with you paul this doesn't look like it's
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:31.360]  going too well for him well their end game they've got up in parliament and said it they want to
[02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:36.800]  basically ethnically cleanse white people that's one of their end games it's that's not a conspiracy
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:42.000]  that's the head of the green party in germany got up in their in in their congress and said
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:47.360]  it is good no more white people we are bad yeah which of course means people who politically
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:53.200]  disagree with them they want the power they don't live in the migrant areas people have done studies
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:59.040]  in sweden all these big leftist politicians who just love mass immigration so much none of them
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:04.400]  live in the migrant areas quite hypocritical but the media's got a problem alex because
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:12.320]  the washington post is now putting out articles saying begging their readers don't call us the
[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:17.200]  media and did you see i read in the first hour did you see how condescending from their editorial
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:22.880]  board it was where it calls us stupid and dumb and stop calling us mainstream you know it's not
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.680]  true we're not in lockstep i mean this is how you would discredit yourself but they're so
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:35.120]  insulated and so arrogant paul they don't realize they've jumped the shark big time no it's a complete
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:41.200]  lack of self-awareness that's the most dangerous problem for the media right now you had the daily
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:48.000]  show trevor Noah again which is it's supposedly a comedy show but you know millions of millenials
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:53.280]  get their news and opinions and narrative from the daily show even after john stewart when it was at
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:59.040]  least somewhat funny now it's just direct propaganda but they had a segment on the daily show where
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:05.760]  they were talking about a conservative commentator called um tome loren who's massive on facebook
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:12.720]  they were saying look she got 65 million views on facebook for one video and they were very serious
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:17.840]  about this they were saying this is a huge problem this is more than ms nbc gets this is
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:23.600]  more than the amount of people who read the book times so now they're finally beginning to realize
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:29.680]  that they're being completely crushed on social media on numerous video platforms which is why
[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:35.920]  you now see the censorship really getting i was about to say now enters the censorship so even though
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:39.840]  we're successful even though we have millions of views on youtube and even though one video of hers
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:45.200]  can have 65 million views and one video of yours can have five million uh one of mine 15 million
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:50.480]  it's panicking them as they actually realize oh my gosh we're in our own little world we've
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:55.440]  already been annihilated we've already been absolutely destroyed so now they're panicking
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:01.680]  saying what do we do and their answer is hand the internet over to the un the answer is shin the
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:07.120]  federal elections commission after us the answer is go after our sponsors i mean this is crazy so
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:11.760]  our listeners have to know you're just as important as paul watson or matt drudge or alex jones or
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:18.960]  joseph farah uh or steven bannon or donald trump quite frankly you are the engine of populism you
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:24.000]  have to start a show you have to write articles you have to post videos you've got to spread the
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.400]  word you've got to fight and they'll never stop us paul well i mean that's that's what i did and i
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:35.600]  can talk about it after the break but they succeeded in one sense in censoring my video about the
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:42.000]  charlotte riots on youtube but i turned lemons into lemonade and basically shot back at them they
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:46.640]  completely fired it completely flew back in their face and we can get into it after the break and
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:50.000]  by the way do we even post that on facebook because we'll post kind of our little nothing videos on
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:54.000]  there but not our big juggernaut ones um we need to post that to facebook and point out this video
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:59.440]  was censored uh by youtube we should post that the truth about charlotte that was censored this
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:04.960]  video was censored let's be put on our facebook video right now no i mean that's that's the point
[02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:10.960]  alex i put it on facebook afterwards and said youtube social justice worries on youtube is
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:16.720]  censoring this video they slapped an age restriction on it now it's still on youtube but what that
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:22.240]  does it prevents the video from going viral because when people send it out to new people
[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:27.600]  who don't have a youtube they're lazy and don't log in yeah it says you have to verify your age
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:31.680]  to watch this video they got a quarter million views in in two hours they put an age restriction
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:36.480]  to stop the flow the next four days and only got another quarter mil so what they did there was
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:43.280]  keeping from getting five million views exactly but i used it to cry censorship which is what it
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:46.320]  was and put it on facebook well good see we're on the same page i didn't even know you've done that
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:52.880]  so what happened there it got 15 million views see see people think i'm bsing i people think i
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:56.400]  exaggerate because i know this like a war game i didn't even know paul did that because i can't
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:01.120]  keep track of all the stuff we're doing okay on our platforms i said man we should have put that on
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:07.520]  facebook and said they censored it we would have gotten i said five million right yeah it got 15 mil
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:13.520]  so let's go to is that on my channel or on your facebook well it was posted on both oh so probably
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:18.320]  more than 15 million okay well let's go look and show people this is an example folks they don't have
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:24.480]  15 million viewers on an average day on cnn okay their average show has 300 000 200 000 viewers
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:31.840]  let me explain this a three minute video paul wassen did got 15 million views we know the
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:38.320]  algorithm 18.2 now actually i mean but that's the thing madel has like a half million views
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:44.400]  she's their star we have like two three million terrestrial radio an hour i mean i'm not bragging
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:49.680]  i just don't get why they're such arrogant pieces of filth paul but you're saying they're coming to
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:54.960]  that moment of realizing or did they always realize it for a while because we've been huge for a long
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:59.280]  time you know drudge has been bigger than for decade plus hey or are they just now discovering
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:03.840]  it or do they now know that their viewers have discovered it i think they've been locked inside
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:09.120]  their own echo chamber for so long they're only just coming to discover it i mean it got 16.2
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:16.960]  million views in one 24 hour period on thursday my tweets alone got five million impressions
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:24.000]  you know i'm doing a hundred million impressions a month on tweets just tweets so they're in big
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.360]  trouble this is why they're trying to censor us this is why they're launching that youtube heroes
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:35.680]  program which again to fight the trolls empowers an army of social justice warriors who were already
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:41.360]  on youtube by the way bragging about how they're going to use this to censor all my videos it gives
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:47.040]  them the power they earn points in a gamified communist chinese style credit score system
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:52.480]  to mass flag videos to delete comments and of course it's going to be videos with
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:56.720]  libertarian conservative opinions that they disagree with it's not about abuse it's not
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:02.560]  about harassment you know facebook i get death threats every day i complain about them on facebook
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:08.160]  send the reports in this doesn't violate our community standards it's like we will rip off
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:14.160]  your head and stick the flag of isis in your body and proclaim victory over your land the new caliphate
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:19.360]  this doesn't violate facebook's terms of agreement so you know it's one rule for us and one rule for
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:24.960]  everyone else and that's what they're relying on youtube is going the way of you know cable
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:30.880]  networks television by censoring independent voices of course none of these rules will be applied
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:35.520]  and by the way paul just showed the devastation against the enemy right now i remember talking
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:38.640]  about this this weekend when they censored you and i made a big deal about it on friday you said
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.880]  yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go make a big deal of this which you should imagine you would have gotten
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:48.240]  five million on youtube but because we've learned the algorithm by them suppressing you it's gotten
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:54.240]  16 million on your channel alone now when we put it on my channel i don't even know if we said it's
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:58.240]  been suppressed but that's a trick for our crew to do the point i've been suppressed it probably
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:03.280]  has 500 thousands we didn't probably promote it on my main facebook but this is what we're talking
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:10.960]  about right there they tried to suppress you 16 million deliciouses now let's expand on that
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:16.560]  they tried to censor you exposing hillary's illness last time i checked on youtube and our
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:23.360]  facebook platforms it's got 14 million views six million on one channel i mean they rachel madal
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:33.760]  doesn't have six million viewers in a month it's ridiculous she's a total paper tiger now the
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:39.440]  the other point alex is it wasn't just that individual video before i posted it i was on
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:48.400]  i think it was about 240 000 followers just on one facebook page now that's up past 290 000 so
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:55.440]  not only did i get the video views i also got the uh the extra 45 000 followers who will watch
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:02.800]  future info wars videos they not only failed to suppress that video they handed me a huge gigantic
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:08.240]  new slice of audience to speak to in future videos so i'd like to personally thank all the
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:15.360]  social justice warriors who flagged that youtube video it's been really really beneficial for future
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:23.040]  videos and you know it really helps thank you very much i'm like a seal thing here's the story
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:28.320]  we we don't get mad we don't give up we just redouble down every time we're attacked that's
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:33.200]  always been my philosophy it's a military philosophy we never give in we never give up
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:38.000]  we love being attacked we enjoy it and we dominate they lose if we just went away when they censored
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:43.040]  it said i'm quitting they censored me no no no no you attack more when they censor then you win
[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:47.680]  paul watson straight ahead your phone call straight ahead and more debate coverage starts
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:53.040]  tonight six o'clock actually we say seven but it's six we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:59.040]  info wars dot com alice shows and the gc n video network info wars dot com for a class show uh
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:04.720]  hundreds of billions russia is pointing out there won't be any peace in syria as long as the obama
[02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:08.960]  administration keeps sending weapons to the isis linked out in those front the russian government
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:14.400]  said the militants are armed by tanks apcs filled artillery multiple rocket launchers and heavy
[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:18.320]  weaponry and of course they could have made these weapons themselves nor could they have stolen all
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:22.320]  of them from the syrian army especially not the american made tow missiles that jihadis used to
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:26.960]  destroy a russian helicopter last year russians also pointed out that the us led airstrike that
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:31.760]  killed 62 syrian soldiers has directly led to isis gaining ground in other words the us just
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:36.960]  served as isis's air force the us state department has claimed the attack was an accident however
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:40.960]  fax points to the contrary the region where the attack occurred has always been under syrian army
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:46.080]  control with no prior presence of isis sent com even had the audacity to release a statement claiming
[02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:50.400]  they have not bombed the area in the past but that's completely false unless they were targeting

[02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:03.440]  as well working with his brother who's a political scientist as well steve watson and the rest of our
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:10.080]  team i am so honored to have paul watson with us i've known this guy 15 plus years and i'm one of
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.440]  the best moves i ever made god has had his hand on this operation finding paul joseph watson
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:21.760]  with his popular blog propaganda matrix and getting him on the team and forcing him
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:29.760]  him out of the nest onto the air you have done well on that so we're gonna go back to you here
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:35.760]  in just a moment but he does a palpatine better than i do with anyways we channel palpatine with
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:41.120]  the office that is the main rule because you can't really mess up on any decision you make when you
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:46.960]  do like a palpatine giggle when you uh okay i'm gonna stop right there can't give up the secret
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:53.120]  sauce ladies and gentlemen uh no no getting serious here for a moment speaking of uh yes
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:58.880]  it's like scoring a touchdown when i can't even keep track of the i say oh we have 10 million
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:04.240]  video views a week that's like super conservative it's like just on our platforms i can't keep
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:09.280]  track of it some weeks it's like 30 40 million it's usually 10 15 20 million it just doesn't
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:15.680]  sound real it's like yeah okay we got five million views on youtube okay the vice president of youtube
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:19.840]  tells us the biggest thing on youtube and will and will they please let us monetize it all
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:25.120]  and i didn't do that because then they shut down the tens of thousands of other channels that carry
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:29.040]  our info where a lot of times it'll be some obscure site that its average video is getting
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:32.800]  like a thousand views and and one of mine will get 10 million views or one of paul's will get
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:42.000]  15 million views it's again the daily show might have a million viewers these people are in their
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:49.360]  own world that's why when they tried to hire me at big network jobs and radio jobs they're like
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:52.320]  you don't want people running around kissing your ass you don't want to be here in new york city or
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:59.920]  l.a. and i'm like no you don't want to like be like oh like one of the big fox reporters oh my gosh
[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:07.520]  makin kelly why she's got three million viewers oh my gosh three million viewers oh my it's so huge
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:13.760]  huge and then her average videos she doesn't hardly ever have viral videos she in the real
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:19.280]  world of people voting with their clicks you people are losers i mean if i want to find hot
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:23.360]  looking chicks online i can find them i don't need to go look at megan kelly that megan kelly
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:29.120]  can you imagine actually being with her on a date the arrogant power-tripping woman as i get older
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:33.120]  i get more choosy and i gotta tell you one thing i wouldn't touch megan kelly i mean megan kelly
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:37.760]  looks like a nightmare a little young madusa she'll probably end up like hillary we're gonna go to
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:43.760]  paul watson here in a moment uh briefly we are running big specials for the americanism versus

[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:42.240]  and it changed my life because i've always been taking probiotics the last four or five years but

[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:12.320]  thank you and salute you sorry paul i want to go to some calls you've got a lot more to cover
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:17.040]  what more do you expect in the debate what other angles should we cover after we take a few phone
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:21.600]  calls i know i kind of went into a little bit of a let's just be honest a little bit of a
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:29.200]  a dorphin in dorphin rush there i'm i'm i'm i'm high as a kite because uh it's just it's not just
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:32.880]  that you got 60 million views on this video that happens all the time it's just realizing that i'm
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:37.600]  not even keeping track of this and i saw four or five of our videos the last few days that had
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:42.880]  millions of views but without even looking we just take it for granted now we are really wrecking
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:49.120]  the hell out of these people this is historic paul no it's it's absolutely huge in the numbers
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:54.400]  show it i mean it's almost going parabolic on some levels you know the more followers you get the more
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:39:00.640]  views you get the more that compounds in future and that kind of runaway viral element to it
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:05.200]  that's what really scares them that's why they're now finally starting to come to the realization
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:10.160]  that they're being crushed you saw it with brexit again that complete lack of self-awareness
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:15.280]  the polls saying oh this is going to be a walk in the park brexit supporters are all racist this
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:20.640]  isn't going to be a problem boom absolute shock they were defeated couldn't believe it you had
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:25.760]  but hurt millenials crying all over social media for weeks and weeks afterwards because it was
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:31.120]  such a shock to them and that looks like it's on the same trajectory with trump but it remains to
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:36.240]  be seen the thing about this debate is we were talking earlier about you know candy Crowley
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:42.320]  and the left pushed to bully lester hall into being an activist moderator well they spoke to
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:49.600]  some people at nbc news this is in a cnn article and it says with regards to fact checking lester
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:56.560]  is not going to be a potted plan one nbc staffer close to halt said another staffer seconded that
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:01.440]  sentiment so even though he's a registered republican in new york he might still be a never
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:06.400]  trump person but they're putting pressure on him especially after this matt lauher thing
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:12.720]  at the previous presidential forum to be an activist moderator to constantly interrupt and
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:18.000]  challenge trump and by the way i'll be honest i didn't even know that he was a republican uh
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.320]  but it's like i didn't know kurt russell was a patriot i just don't like any of these anchors i mean
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:27.200]  almost none of them i like brit hugham even though he's goofy and i don't agree with he's a rhino but
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:31.440]  i tell you i really like lester halt anytime i see him i like stop and listen and i mean
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:36.640]  williams and all the rest of them i can't even watch those people so i didn't realize he was a
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:43.280]  republican no he is it and you know it it remains to be seen whether he's pressured into becoming
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:48.320]  an activist moderator because they also got heat for the matt lauher thing that i think it was the
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:55.120]  president of nbc um andrew lack i think his name is you know he got heat for it as well for simply
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:41:00.880]  having questions about hillary clinton's email scandal so he got lambasted for that it's nbc
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:07.120]  again tonight so will they cave into the pressure or will he be fair to both sides and not try and
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:12.080]  fact check trump let me ask you this question and i'm gonna call what does your gut tell you i mean
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:16.480]  i have the polls she's abandoning ohio uh trump surging head in pennsylvania that was you know
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:21.280]  10 points a month ago for hillary that's even with skewed polls every poll shows him ahead
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:26.800]  basically now about three to points to six points internal polls 10 points or more except fox they've
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:32.960]  got him behind showing how they've been kuday todd what are they gonna do what are they gonna pull
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:39.920]  well i mean a lot these polls are inaccurate to begin with alex because they over sample democrats
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:45.120]  the monmouth poll has done that time and time again but you look at the um people who have tracked
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:51.440]  presidential races for decades and decades they're all saying that it's basically inevitable that
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:57.920]  trump will win and these people in almost every case have never been wrong so whereas these polls
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:03.680]  in you know statewide might change from week to week these established political analysts who have
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:09.040]  tracked and successfully predicted presidential outcomes for decades and decades there was another
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:13.920]  one in the washington post on friday saying the same thing they're all saying that trump's gonna win
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:18.480]  that the juggernaut's not gonna stop so if you look at that it seems like that's the way it's
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:23.920]  heading sure as well as this reluctance you know with people answering questions for polls
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:29.680]  to say that they're going to vote for trump simply because of the social stigma attached to it
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:35.040]  by the popular culture that says trump is literally hitler and he's going to destroy the world
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:39.120]  they're still gonna vote for him they just don't want to tell somebody over the phone which is
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:44.720]  exactly what happened with brexit and by the way as you know blumberg has gone out with top analysts
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:49.680]  and they're now saying 40 chance of trump win well the new york times had even you know 97
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:54.000]  percent chance is gonna lose 89 percent now it's dropping they just don't want to look like too big
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.560]  of fools and give it away too quick they put out those numbers to make it look like hillary was
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:05.200]  inevitable it was all a fraud now that their attempt at disinformation and hoaxing has failed
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:10.640]  they're now every day upping the chances trump's gonna win it's very transparent so i see this
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:15.360]  election more of not just a rejection of globalism but a rejection of the mainstream media
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:22.320]  it's the people's insurgency against the political establishment like i've said before if it wasn't
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:28.400]  trump it would be someone else this has been going on across europe for the past four or five years
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:34.480]  culminating in brexit so this isn't just about donald trump that's why he's not just a demagogue
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:39.760]  this is about an entire movement that we've been tracking for years and years the guy that predicted
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:45.760]  that he would win is professor alan lictman and he was in the uh washington post on friday he's
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:50.560]  correct correctly predicted the winner of the popular vote in every presidential election since
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:57.200]  1984 so you had the other guy who was on fox with um lou dobbs basically saying the same thing
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:02.320]  they're all saying that it's in the bag for trump and these people haven't been wrong so far the
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:06.960]  only wildcards that trump assassination or a new war i want to go to some calls keep you a little
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:10.080]  bit the next hour i know you've got to go david night's coming in i've got to go i've got to get
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:15.040]  geared up for live coverage six o'clock it was going to be seven an hour before it's eight o'clock

[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:27.120]  10 30 11 o'clock at nine at least an hour after the debate with your phone calls with live coverage
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:32.800]  with roger stone and more info wars dot com forward slash show if you want to spread that link to
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:37.040]  everybody that's really the key to the info war obviously folks please help us get that out on
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:42.480]  facebook twitter you name it so people can get a feed that actually counters uh any chicanering
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:47.360]  but i want to go to calls and then after we do that paul i have a clip was the top link on drudge
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:55.040]  today city warrants uh on gold as bank boost odds of trump win the 40 percent i just mentioned that
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:00.000]  but that's coming up and again how are they going to suppress gold i think mr dent and others are
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:05.120]  really smart and i agree we have a depression happening but even though we have such dollar
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:10.000]  devaluation and other currency devaluation basic commodities are going to have to go up and we see
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:17.520]  oil doing that we see gold doing that what do you think paul well i'm not sure where it's
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:22.400]  heading in the near future but i know that after brexit they well before brexit they said there's
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:27.360]  going to be an economic collapse in the united kingdom there's going to be a house price collapse
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:32.480]  everything's going south it's going to be a financial armageddon nothing happened
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:37.520]  it was all fiamongering it was all hyperbole again they had a headline in the financial
[02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:43.600]  times on friday the trumpian threat to the global order the liberal rules-based system
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:48.240]  established after 1945 is under unprecedented strength so that's the new thing is a crashing
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:52.640]  economy if we don't vote for hillary let's go to phone calls here he's been holding the longest
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:56.080]  let's talk to chris in virginia thanks for holding me on the air with paul wasen
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:04.640]  all right um our first thing i think is that they're going to try the strategy of the unfit
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:10.960]  for president because uh that's the only thing i see them going with to try to make trouble with
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:16.960]  unfit so i think he's going to have to hammer her on the economy to keep her focused on the economy
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:25.120]  and what's going on there what do you think paul about what christus said i think his best method
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:32.160]  of attack will be um foreign policy obviously vangarzi the fact that she personally supported
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:38.240]  and celebrated a policy even though she's wailing at trump about islamophobia a policy that
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:44.480]  displaced and killed over a hundred million muslims as a result of you know toppling ghada
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:48.560]  i agree that's the key to go after her being the mother of isis and the modern al-qaeda
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:53.840]  also what about her only giving uh five point seven percent of the money she got for Haitian
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:59.840]  refugees to charity that's going to be going to be key as well as the saudi arabian connection
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:04.320]  she's going to get up there and again claim that the fact that she has female genitalia
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:09.520]  is the prime reason for her becoming president and trump can immediately fire back and ask her
[02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:15.120]  about the donations from saudi arabia you know a country that treats women a little better than
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:22.160]  cattle a country that just allowed them to ride bikes for entertainment purposes only they can't
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:27.760]  even travel on bikes that's how suppressed they are in saudi arabia yet hillary clinton the
[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:31.920]  champion of women's rights takes hundreds of millions of dollars from them that's the key
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:37.840]  attack that's right press what else would you attack on how should trump go after her i think
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:44.160]  he should also go after her on the old cocaine rumors or the arkansas day because if you can
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:50.960]  make her out to be a criminal basically it can hammer that home that she this lady is a criminal
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:54.640]  i've interviewed the cia people that were there with the planes full of cocaine he could say
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:59.200]  you need to be investigated for me and what you did just like he brought up ted cruz's dad the cia
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:03.440]  and boy ted cruz dropped out the next day great points chris do you think she'll make it do you
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:11.520]  think she'll collapse uh do you think she'll uh have some kind of problem i think they pumped her up
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:17.440]  with enough drugs to make it at least for that hour and a half now after that i don't know but
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:23.520]  why can't we make a rest like if these we got i know we have a lot of patriots in the government
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:27.680]  and a lot of people leaking information don't you think it's time is getting to the critical
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.560]  time now that people need to stand up and start making a round well it came out that the fbi
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:35.920]  never intended to indict her and it's totally controlled so i gotta say at the top our government
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:40.480]  is run by criminals there's there's no doubt thank you paul i mean what about the criminal option
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:44.320]  isn't there some state courts that can go after her i mean she has been caught violating national
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:51.120]  security laws i don't know about that alex i'm not a lawyer but the other thing about the debate is
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:56.560]  you know this is an audience that has been told to remain quiet you saw with the republican primaries
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:01.520]  whooping hollering laughing throughout shouting out it's going to be half and half hillary trump
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:06.160]  audience will they get a heckler in there we saw how hillary responded with her handler
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:11.440]  having to calm her down when she last had a heckler or could trump get a heckler could that
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:16.880]  influence the way the debate goes it could happen given how good point tensions on let's go to
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:21.520]  steve and florida steve you're on the year with paul watson and our debate coverage i should add

[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:27.840]  with the constitution in one hand and the bill of rights in the other on either side of her

[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:51.360]  this is city warrants on gold as bank boost odds of trump win to 40 but the new york times
[02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:57.360]  said hillary was 97 i mean they're owned by the mexican kingpin so it must be true here is that
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:05.600]  report exactly you city saying it was city group is seeing increased volatility in the
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:10.080]  gold and the forex market through to the end of the year because of the us presidential race
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:15.680]  and because of the possibility that the us fed bayhawk interest rates in december as you said it
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:21.360]  says the presidential race is tightening in the us and now it puts a probability of a trump victory
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:28.880]  at 40 percent up from 35 percent just a few weeks ago and now of course this is ahead of the televised
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:36.000]  debate in the us this evening heidi right so i mean where does that leave their price forecasts
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:43.600]  well first of all this has to be put into context that gold is up 26 percent this year already in a
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:49.360]  world of low negative interest rates of monetary easing now city group have raised their base
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:58.320]  forecast for the fourth quarter to $1,320 an ounce and that's up from $1,280 but under its
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:04.160]  bullish case scenario where it sees a trump victory it sees worsening worries over the global economy
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:10.800]  and the dovish fed it sees prices going up to $1,425 an ounce in the fourth quarter
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:20.320]  and $1,450 in the first quarter of 2017 and that compares with a current gold price of about $1,335
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:24.720]  all right that's enough full clips up on info wars.com
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:30.800]  my nose is never wrong i mean i said i've been not been promoting gold for about three four years

[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:40.080]  by crescent i said it's up 25 right now i don't know how i know all this stuff i'm not bragging
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:45.680]  it's just crazy my gut is never wrong and it tells it's never wrong i mean it might be wrong

[03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:33.040]  media that fills the gap where the mainstream media has basically collapsed they're they're dead
[03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:36.720]  already they're just now figuring that out they're not going to counter strike how to shut down our
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:42.480]  free speech we have to fight back against that paul watson who is the epitome of the new independent
[03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:48.240]  media uh is our gas to be with us till 15 after and then david night is taking over and then we'll
[03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:54.080]  be back tonight six o'clock we're gonna have a live feed uh if they're at the debate we'll have
[03:00:54.080 --> 03:01:00.480]  reporters from right side news and our own reporters on the ground uh popping in oh and shroyer

[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:12.560]  then uh i'll be there during the 90 minutes with giving limited analysis and then we'll have an hour
[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:17.600]  or two afterwards with live coverage paul i want to jam in a few final calls but
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:25.200]  when i talk about you being or info wars being an example of of the real media
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:31.600]  uh 15 years ago joining info wars are starting your own website i guess 17 18 years ago did you
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:38.800]  ever imagine you'd be here now well it was all it was always the goal alex it's definitely
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:44.640]  accelerated over the past two years just on the social media platforms but of course we've got to
[03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:49.600]  recognize and always remember that those aren't always going to be there like drudge warned
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:54.720]  about these internet ghettos these social media ghettos they can be handed out and taken away on
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:02:00.400]  a whim which is why you've now got youtube with its heroes program with these people salivating
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:04.960]  over the fact they're going to flag and send to my videos but we will always have unless they
[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:09.680]  censor the internet outright and come after it with you know with government power rather than
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:15.600]  with mob outrage power we will always have info wars they will never be able to censor that that's
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:21.840]  why it's always key to have your own platform facebook twitter youtube are only mechanisms
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:26.400]  to divide to divert traffic back to your own platform that's what you've always got to bear
[03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:30.400]  in mind that's why drudge has remained you know safe that's why you've got bright but
[03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:36.240]  that's why you've got info wars we can always rely on our own platform if you put all your
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:41.920]  eggs into the basket of social media they can take it away on a whim in fact they had a prominent
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:48.960]  turkish journalist today twitter is suspending his account on the orders of the turkish dictator
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:55.280]  erdogan because he was critical of him this is a mainstream journal unprecedented yeah you know
[03:02:55.280 --> 03:03:00.720]  twitter is now mostly unbashed Saudi Arabia they allow islamists to run riot but yet they
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:05.680]  censor conservatives now they're censoring a prominent mainstream turkish journalist
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:10.400]  because he criticized the dictator so that's what happens if you allow everything to be
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:15.040]  segregated into these social media ghettos why does the so-called to build your own platform
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:19.280]  first exactly why does the left have no shame i mean they're allied with the scum of the earth now
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:23.280]  they're just their filth i mean they are really bad people
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:30.720]  well there's an article out of um information liberation feminist sex racist and for italians
[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:36.240]  to have italian babies italy's native population is dying the government's come out with these
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:42.800]  schemes these ads begging italian citizens to have babies the leftist in italy came out and
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:48.480]  said that was racist that was sexist how dare you tell women what to do with their own bodies
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:55.120]  yet on the flip side we have female volunteers at calais jungle having sex with multiple refugees
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:04:00.320]  a day of course what's really going on and they volunteer the hottest women they'll have sex with
[03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:05.680]  the refugees because it's what the media said to do talk about airheads yeah it's trendy but
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:11.200]  in many cases that of course they're being raped and then told by these left-wing organizations
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:16.000]  not to speak out about it i think it's time we go save italian women from the refugees i'm sorry
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:23.440]  i'm sorry go ahead paul no we've seen in several cases they've been raped and they've come out
[03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:27.280]  after and said well i didn't really want to say anything about it because that might be racist
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:32.000]  swedes on trains being raped by migrants and saying well i didn't tell the police because
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:37.600]  you know they're migrants they're from iraq perhaps they should have the right to rape us maybe after
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:41.360]  we what we because they have a superior culture stay there paul a few more minutes with you
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:46.160]  i want to ask you your gut predictions or tonight what's going to happen in the debate

[03:05:27.840 --> 03:05:32.400]  example the presidential debate commission denied hillary her request for a step stool at her podium
[03:05:32.400 --> 03:05:37.040]  according to the dredge report and his info wars reported in august hillary cannot even give a long

[03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:44.480]  use we're not going to have another 42 days of in a couple days i've got another song we're going
[03:08:44.480 --> 03:08:49.840]  to be using and we're going to have basically by the final day before the election nothing but
[03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:56.320]  countdowns uh so i tell you in most elections i'm asleep through them most debates i can care less
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:00.480]  because there's not much difference these differences are massive we had a caller earlier
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:08.720]  saying she doesn't see the difference between the two i mean we have all the internal emails all
[03:09:08.720 --> 03:09:13.440]  the proof all the big money not giving any money the republican establishment pulling their hair
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:18.240]  out the democrats freaking out every criminal regime from the chinese communists to the horrible
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:25.520]  islamist uh saudi royalty crapping their pants so paul i'm going to let you punch out here in a
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:29.600]  few minutes i'm going to go to these calls and have david night come in but i got to tell you my
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:36.560]  friend i have never been more entertained and you know i was really negative 10 years ago trying
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:41.280]  to get people to really wake up it was happening but incredibly positive things are happening
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:46.000]  uh sure the enemy is going to pull out of stuff but uh you can just see history repeating itself
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:50.720]  where the good guys are going to end up getting the the high ground here if we all take action and
[03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:56.640]  ask god for providence but in your gut let's put it on the line what do you predict for tonight's
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:00.000]  debate and after you're gone i'll tell folks what i think we'll get david's take and then i'm going
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:06.720]  to punch out until i come back on from five hours tonight at seven again and we have pre stuff at
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:11.760]  six central but we're going to start fully with full coverage an hour before seven o'clock central
[03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:16.480]  and inform us dot com four slash show what is your gut level just stalled what do you predict for
[03:10:16.480 --> 03:10:24.400]  tonight i think if trump does what his advisors are probably telling him to do which is to look
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:30.320]  presidential and not lash out too much at hillary you know not shout i mean we saw the video a few
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:35.840]  days ago from hillary absolutely bizarre you played it she was propped up shouting about how
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:41.200]  she should be 50 points ahead look looking absolutely maniacal you know he has to be the
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:47.760]  opposite of that you know quite reserved on point presidential he needs it to be a quite a boring
[03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:53.120]  debate hillary clinton is going to try and attack him she's going to try to provoke him
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:59.360]  and make him fit this stereotype of a woman hating bully or whatever the media wants to portray him
[03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:07.040]  as anyway so if he if he just you know stays calm stays steady and avoids that kind of confrontation
[03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:13.360]  and stays on the topics keeps hitting hillary on her weak spots you know the email scandal foreign
[03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:19.280]  policy those kind of issues then he will come out on top and the media is already panicking
[03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:24.400]  about trump winning this debate they've got headlines out ahead of time saying well romney
[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:29.920]  crushed obama in the first debate in 2012 look what happened in the election romney lost so you
[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:35.120]  can tell by that that the media thinks trump's going to come out on top and and barring some
[03:11:35.760 --> 03:11:39.200]  outside influence of course you've got the moderators you've got the audience that could
[03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:43.600]  be an influence but that's probably what's going to happen when are we going to release the september
[03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:48.800]  surprise article and then when are we going to release obama saying he hates america and hates
[03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:54.960]  white people video well he's trying to crowdfund that video last time i checked he's probably about
[03:11:55.520 --> 03:12:00.240]  four grand short but he's got to pay his private eye before he can show that video so it's going to
[03:12:00.240 --> 03:12:05.360]  be it's going to be coming soon whatever happens there are people claiming obama never said that
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:09.200]  well it the video hasn't been released we're going to release the video it's going to be
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:13.040]  exclusively on info walls i can just pay for it i guess i'm not made out of money but uh
[03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:18.480]  uh well he's already raised most of it but i guess it'll be in the next week you pay it
[03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:22.960]  send me the bill or i'll just give me the i'll pay it just get hooked up with the accounting folks
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:27.360]  and let's just get this done all right we'll get it done today absolutely just like you did when
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:32.000]  you went ahead and licensed the ap video which i get why you did it uh or the video from uh
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:36.640]  whatever group that was i guess it was golden sacks that bought it up or uh of hillary collapsing
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:41.760]  obviously it was fair use everybody else had it but they were blocking everybody's videos
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:45.280]  and then trying to deny that she'd fallen down for the first day we had to get the video out
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:50.160]  there's people will know the truth so at this point i'm just all in a history is happening uh
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:56.400]  paul so in 42 days who gets elected well with all the momentum with the way it's going it's
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:01.520]  got to be donald trump and like i warned about in that video from last week they're getting
[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:05.920]  desperate i mean hillary's going to be a cornered animal at this point they're going to try and
[03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:11.280]  pull some kind of incident some kind of racist attack some kind of domestic terror attack and
[03:13:11.280 --> 03:13:16.080]  blame it on a trump supporter that's why she keeps talking about the alt right saying it's
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:21.520]  dangerous it's hateful it's violent that's what they're going to rely on that's going to be hillary's
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:26.400]  october surprise i agree with you paul watson thank you so much for joining us and we will uh
[03:13:26.400 --> 03:13:30.320]  obviously be tracking everything you're posting and in full wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:36.640]  thank you thanks alex all right there goes paul watson uh now we got david night coming up here
[03:13:36.640 --> 03:13:39.200]  in a minute i want to get to some more of these phone calls here we're going to skip this network
[03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:43.040]  breaks we have more time but that's the last one today i'm gonna good boy plus i can skip some
[03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:47.360]  breaks i added a fourth hour so let's give a few breaks it's the same thing you know that a fifth
[03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:51.680]  hour skip even more breaks and the aggregate it all comes out the same amount of breaks um
[03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:58.880]  what does your gut tell you david i think what paul said is pretty much dead on i mean the the
[03:13:58.880 --> 03:14:04.880]  system now knows the confidence has been lost in it it realizes that it's in big trouble but a lot
[03:14:04.880 --> 03:14:11.120]  of its own operatives are still full of arrogance hootsbub bravada whatever you want to call it
[03:14:11.760 --> 03:14:16.480]  which is a dangerous combination yeah you know alex uh i think it's kind of telling that hillary
[03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:22.720]  clinton came out last week and said uh i've got a tax plan for 65 percent uh that's not the the
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:28.160]  sort of thing that you want to brag about regardless of what income level that is to me it looks like
[03:14:28.160 --> 03:14:31.520]  they they realize they've lost and they're going to come out here and say uh yeah we're going to
[03:14:31.520 --> 03:14:36.720]  by the way 65 top tax rate would end investment in the country i want to explain to people the
[03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:41.760]  globalist have we have the highest corporate tax the big corporations like berkshire hathaway
[03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:46.960]  and and google lobby for that because they want to move offshore and they want that incentivized
[03:14:46.960 --> 03:14:52.080]  and they don't want companies that they can compete with in america being here the big mega banks
[03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:58.800]  want high taxes because they're exempt from them folks so a 65 tax would be a death sentence sorry go
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:03.280]  ahead well yeah that's trickle down unemployment as you're pointing out alex you know think about
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:09.280]  this also hillary clinton has taken the last week off now i don't know if it's because she's sick you
[03:15:09.280 --> 03:15:13.680]  know i i guess the dnc has become the make-a-wish foundation for illy clinton you know her her
[03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:17.920]  fundamental wishes she wants to be president so let's make it happen before she dies but it may
[03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:22.320]  be that she just thought she needed a week to prepare and to figure out what it is that she
[03:15:22.320 --> 03:15:28.080]  really believes you know does she support tpp this week or not i you know let's let's do some uh
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:33.840]  polling stick our finger in the wind and see what this is going to be but i think you know i think
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:37.280]  it's going to be an interesting debate tonight i think she's going to make it i think they're going
[03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:42.000]  to prop her up or shoot her up with whatever they need to to make sure that she can go the distance
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:46.320]  tonight but we'll see i think she's got some very serious health issues but she's got the biggest
[03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:52.480]  thing she's got before her is that she really isn't sure who she is in terms of telling the people
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:59.040]  we know who she is we know that she is a pathological liar that she is focused on uh making millions
[03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:05.120]  tens of millions of dollars for uh her and bill but uh she's not sure exactly who she is in terms
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:11.040]  of her public persona i think it was a big defeat for her as well on friday when she had said she
[03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:16.000]  was going to go to charlotte and the mayor there wisely and this is a democrat mayor and and remember
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:21.440]  it was a black cop who shot the black man working for a black police chief working in a city that's
[03:16:21.440 --> 03:16:27.200]  run by democrats and the democrat mayor said uh please don't come and so that to both of them
[03:16:27.200 --> 03:16:32.160]  but trump had not said he was going to go to charlotte she said she was going to go you're
[03:16:32.160 --> 03:16:37.680]  going to be covering all this coming up here in just a moment let me give folks my brief prediction
[03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:44.560]  i think she's going to be heavily drugged up to not have convulsions we know she's
[03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:50.800]  having convulsions on a basically hourly basis yeah that's why when she does go out in public
[03:16:50.800 --> 03:16:57.120]  she looks so drugged up because she is drugged up so if she doesn't look drugged up then i think
[03:16:57.120 --> 03:17:00.960]  she's going to have a convulsion or collapse i just i think they're arrogant i think they're
[03:17:00.960 --> 03:17:05.520]  gamblers i think they're reckless they've shown that they've rolled the dice so many times i think
[03:17:05.520 --> 03:17:10.720]  they're invincible and that's why she shouldn't be president we don't want a gambler a megalomaniac
[03:17:11.280 --> 03:17:18.560]  a kleptocrat in power uh so i think that uh hillary if she's not drugged up is going to end up
[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:23.840]  basically collapsing during the debate and it's going to be epic and they somehow think they're
[03:17:23.840 --> 03:17:28.400]  going to spend that that oh the poor thing we better go for trump but but the reason i think
[03:17:28.400 --> 03:17:34.880]  she's going in knowing she may have a convulsion and collapse is because the democratic party
[03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:39.600]  have set this as a bellwether if she can't make it through this they're going to force her to step
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:46.480]  down and they're going to put somebody else in there like joe biden or like mr kane and so this
[03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:52.480]  is all or nothing this is hillary's career on the line and the next two debates on the line as well
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:57.520]  but this is the big one the most important day in her life and i think that stress and the the
[03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:03.120]  political uh ghosts that are coming around to haunt her and all of her concerns and all the
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:08.480]  email scandals and all of it are compounding and i think the level of pressure she's going to be
[03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:15.360]  under is going to be astounding and uh i think we're going to see a collapse of hillary clinton
[03:18:15.360 --> 03:18:21.120]  tonight if if she walks out all jacked up like she's on speed i think she's going to collapse or
[03:18:21.120 --> 03:18:26.160]  have to cut it short or have a break or be hanging on the podium at least but if she comes out looking
[03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:30.000]  dopey and they've got her on all those suppressants then she might make it through the debate but
[03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:34.560]  she's going to be like a robot uh just basically battling through it david i want to take a few
[03:18:34.560 --> 03:18:38.880]  calls here and hand the baton to you what's your take on that i agree with you alex and you know i
[03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:43.840]  see a lot of chatter from the uh pundits saying well this is going to be very different for donald
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:48.240]  trump because he's used to doing big crowds you know cheering crowds and even the debates that he
[03:18:48.240 --> 03:18:53.840]  had with the republicans it was kind of like a wwe match he's done a lot of intimate one-on-one
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:58.480]  type of things and i think when we look at that last uh thing that they did where she spoke for
[03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:03.600]  half hour and then he spoke for half hour the military uh groups i think he was better than
[03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:08.800]  ever when it was an intimate is a people person yeah i mean we're claiming that he doesn't know
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:13.200]  what to do because he's in the real world they're in fantasy land right is is is amazing okay great
[03:19:13.200 --> 03:19:18.160]  points let's see i'm in a few calls here i promise to do that i've been holding the longest here dana
[03:19:18.160 --> 03:19:25.360]  in florida uh go ahead hey um i wanted to let you guys know that uh my husband and i really
[03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:29.920]  appreciate all the uh tireless work that you do every day trying to wake up people because when
[03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:34.320]  we try to say the things you say people call us crazy and racist and all that stuff so
[03:19:34.320 --> 03:19:39.760]  you guys have a much bigger platform and we really appreciate your work um i had a thought that
[03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:44.560]  occurred to me today that i wanted to bounce off you guys see what you think um all this misdirection
[03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:49.280]  and the animosity and lies about the cops in the media and you know the obvious stuff that
[03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:54.000]  didn't happen that they're saying like planning that gun um do you think that could possibly all
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:20:02.720]  be just a very early part of another large uh plan to create so much fear and distrust with the cops
[03:20:02.720 --> 03:20:09.280]  that not only does somebody not want to be a cop but that people would actually support the government
[03:20:09.280 --> 03:20:14.960]  removing all power from the cops and just deploying a complete militarized martial law
[03:20:14.960 --> 03:20:19.360]  where well sure i mean it's the globalists that have made the police have the problems they have
[03:20:19.360 --> 03:20:23.440]  now they want to come in the very authors of the problem and take them over as if they're
[03:20:23.440 --> 03:20:29.120]  going to fix it the very central system that did all this wants a mini civil war rebellion
[03:20:29.120 --> 03:20:32.800]  but against local government that's what george soros has done all over the world it's totally
[03:20:32.800 --> 03:20:38.720]  and completely transparent they want a type of soft martial law and they now you can see the beta
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:44.480]  testing the branding to try to turn minorities into hispanic and black kkk members and quite
[03:20:44.480 --> 03:20:47.840]  frankly i don't think it's going very well you've got the media with their unified talking points
[03:20:47.840 --> 03:20:52.320]  to prop it up but it's not working well thank you dana great points uh let's go ahead and
[03:20:52.320 --> 03:21:00.000]  talk to phil in florida you're on the air worldwide hey guys thanks for having me on um listen i think
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:06.960]  that uh hillary uh trump needs to hit hillary on her tax plan on her email server on bangazi
[03:21:06.960 --> 03:21:12.960]  and then the secret 28 pages i mean saudi arabia senate when they made all that yeah they made all
[03:21:12.960 --> 03:21:18.880]  that stuff secret um and then speaking of that paul ryan has come out and he said that he has
[03:21:18.880 --> 03:21:25.200]  some hesitation about the bill and i think that the 28 pages and this bill about suing saudi
[03:21:25.200 --> 03:21:30.560]  arabia for the victims is an excellent delineator so people can make their new world order lists
[03:21:30.560 --> 03:21:38.240]  the people that are uh against this bill need to go on your new world order list well that's
[03:21:38.240 --> 03:21:43.520]  right because obviously more than saudi arabia is involved pentagon knows it the cia knows it
[03:21:43.520 --> 03:21:47.360]  our guests know it and they want it to all come out they're the ones that want because it will
[03:21:47.360 --> 03:21:51.280]  lead to the criminals in our government that have been involved with the radical muslims and
[03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:56.400]  and saudi arabia all being brought down and believe me mi6 has got its own problems it wants to go
[03:21:56.400 --> 03:22:01.520]  after soros everybody's sick of this because here's the globalist biggest fault we have boss
[03:22:01.520 --> 03:22:06.720]  law and corruption in the west we have bad stuff that goes on but at the end of the day we don't
[03:22:06.720 --> 03:22:12.560]  like people hurting little kids and we don't like people destroying prosperity and having
[03:22:12.560 --> 03:22:18.880]  a heart on you know against uh the a score to settle with the family and and and even a lot
[03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:23.040]  of folks in america aren't practicing christians they're not out to get christians and deep in
[03:22:23.040 --> 03:22:26.720]  their heart you know they know grandma love jesus so so they do too and they're trying to and they're
[03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:32.240]  figuring out wait a minute i sell out to you and then you come after me for how i look or or you've
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:36.720]  got a score to settle with people that just want prosperity you know what we're not going down this
[03:22:36.720 --> 03:22:41.760]  road and that's why this worm is turning because even their own people that are mercenaries are
[03:22:41.760 --> 03:22:46.480]  figuring out there's not prosperity down this road and you're a chump when you work with the new world
[03:22:46.480 --> 03:22:51.680]  order phil yeah and they're they're they're remembering the night of the long nights i mean
[03:22:51.680 --> 03:22:56.160]  are you going to have a seat at that table are you going to get nice exactly you no one's safe
[03:22:56.160 --> 03:23:00.640]  when we sell out to the new world order that there there is no sell out you con yourself
[03:23:01.280 --> 03:23:07.360]  you're a loser if you sell out to this and so that's why the worm is turning i i absolutely
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:10.960]  agree with phil excellent excellent points david that's a quick question for you let me go back
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:15.520]  to calls uh and then i'm gonna punch out here in a moment what are some of the questions that you
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:21.280]  would be asking uh of um mrs hitler here what are some of the points you'd be making at this
[03:23:21.280 --> 03:23:25.680]  crime boss uh well before i get to that alex let me back up just a little bit here and say when
[03:23:25.680 --> 03:23:31.440]  you're talking about this 9-11 bill obama vetoed that on friday yes hoping that nobody would notice
[03:23:31.440 --> 03:23:36.960]  and we need to shout that from the rooftops because this is something the people who are victims of
[03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:42.480]  9-11 their families have been trying to get the right to take these uh you know to take a look at
[03:23:42.480 --> 03:23:46.960]  this looks both the republicans this i mean i'm congressman john said this will bring down the
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:51.360]  bush he said the bushes and the clintons are done when this comes out notice when trump brought this up
[03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:58.320]  in one week jeb gave up yeah just trump knows yes yes and and he was the one that was able to get
[03:23:58.320 --> 03:24:04.400]  this through alex even though we had the senators the former senators who were on the 9-11 commission
[03:24:04.400 --> 03:24:10.880]  had been complaining for 15 years trump trump is exposing nafta get exactly 9-11 of the big banks
[03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:16.240]  the rig stock markets everything i mean trump is awesome he's he's wrong on snowed in a few things
[03:24:16.240 --> 03:24:20.480]  we're gonna educate him on that i mean the point is he's for real they're crapping their pants great
[03:24:20.480 --> 03:24:24.800]  point well here's the thing about trump you know i have people say well you know look he supports
[03:24:24.800 --> 03:24:29.520]  torture whatever or some other issue that i don't agree with and i said but understand
[03:24:29.520 --> 03:24:33.520]  that on the issues that we don't agree with him on there is no difference between him and the rest
[03:24:33.520 --> 03:24:37.840]  of the candidates and you have to understand that are the things that's right they're all bad they're
[03:24:37.840 --> 03:24:42.960]  the only one who's saying that johnson supports the tpp and gun control yeah but on the issues that
[03:24:42.960 --> 03:24:47.760]  we agree with him on he is the only one who is saying that and that's the key one of the things
[03:24:47.760 --> 03:24:52.320]  i want to talk about is is gingrich putting out this tweet yesterday he said uh hillary clinton
[03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:58.880]  is a fox she knows many facts but donald trump is a hedgehog he knows one thing and that is really
[03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:04.800]  key that is the sign of an effective leader at this level not that he's going to get bogged down
[03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:08.000]  in a lot of facts like hillary clinton is going to get bogged down tonight and of course we're
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:13.040]  going to be there fact checking the fox hillary clinton knows deals have been set up screw the
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:18.160]  country he's out for america's interest you don't and by the way he is super smart but but what he
[03:25:18.160 --> 03:25:21.840]  said is i'm too much of a fox he said this many times he goes the day i learned to just go with my
[03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:27.600]  first instinct and be shallow was the deepest day of my life well that's true your first approximation
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:32.800]  is your spirit your instincts your common sense your subconscious god everything giving you that
[03:25:32.800 --> 03:25:39.280]  first approximation and it's never wrong folks and so trump's so deep he goes with that but then he
[03:25:39.280 --> 03:25:43.280]  goes and does the research i think i'm going to punch out now if you can get to these you can al
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:47.920]  killer and canadian soldier i know we're great callers eric and mike and we got mike and england
[03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:51.920]  so many others but david's got a lot to cover i've got to get off here because i've got to get ready
[03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:56.400]  for coverage tonight but we're going to go at seven but you said hey we've got a feed earlier than
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:26:00.560]  that you know of the debate hall so we're just going to go with that at six with our reporters

[03:26:55.200 --> 03:27:04.480]  killer hey david am i on yes you're on go ahead hey uh just want to say thank god for the renegades
[03:27:04.480 --> 03:27:10.160]  and the life they'd be far ahead of their time while we were criticizing trump in the beginning
[03:27:10.160 --> 03:27:15.280]  as soon as the vaccine came as soon as he made his vaccine statement i know he was for real yeah i
[03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:21.520]  think the two major things he's got to hit hillary on tonight when i played the became we saw he died
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:26.800]  clip for people that are hillary supporters they cannot believe what they say he needs to bring
[03:27:26.800 --> 03:27:35.200]  up that she is the she is the architect of the arab spring and this is not this is not the this is
[03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:40.080]  not a sane person when you hear her saying what you said about kentucky nobody in the right mind
[03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:45.120]  would say this going back any predator general ever there wasn't a threat to anybody as we pointed
[03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:50.640]  out many times and what she did was she created chaos out of order in that country the same as
[03:27:50.640 --> 03:27:55.840]  they're doing in syria and between those two countries she has set the world on fire she and
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:28:02.800]  obama so i think that's something that when they talk to her about syria i hope that uh you know
[03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:07.200]  it comes up that uh went in the past she said well we're not going to have any boots on the ground
[03:28:07.840 --> 03:28:13.280]  ever again in that area they do have boots on the ground in iraq they've got 4 000 they're adding
[03:28:13.280 --> 03:28:17.760]  another 10 percent or a little bit more than that actually another 500 says a bit more than 10 percent
[03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:21.120]  they're sending there but they're saying well they're not on the ground they're just advisors or
[03:28:21.120 --> 03:28:26.800]  whatever she doesn't even know what's going on she's supposed to be this uh all wise all knowing
[03:28:26.800 --> 03:28:33.040]  experienced politician she simply says what she feels like and then never nobody ever calls her on
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:39.360]  the facts it's absolutely amazing and you know you know and i really want trump to point to
[03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:45.040]  talk tonight because he he did it during the republican uh preliminaries where he kept pointing
[03:28:45.040 --> 03:28:49.360]  out that these these rebels that were arming up you know called all he said we do call them all
[03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:53.040]  these grammars named the freedom rebels the moderate rebels we don't even know who we're
[03:28:53.040 --> 03:28:59.040]  arming up over there he needs to point out that i mean russia i mean i couldn't believe what what
[03:28:59.040 --> 03:29:04.640]  i heard over the weekend with uh general dumpford and the congressman didn't even know what planet
[03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:11.040]  he was on uh asking him to do it no fly zone and he didn't understand the repercussions of it
[03:29:11.040 --> 03:29:16.160]  yes i mean this is it's absolute insanity that's going on with that and i think what
[03:29:16.160 --> 03:29:21.440]  they want to make trump out to be the guy that has a temperament issue i really think he needs to
[03:29:21.440 --> 03:29:25.520]  break down it's totally out of control we got to go to break thank you al killer you know when we
[03:29:25.520 --> 03:29:29.680]  talk about not even knowing who the players are over there they keep telling us well this group
[03:29:29.680 --> 03:29:34.560]  is moderate they're good guys and we're gonna then we find out they're al-qaeda meanwhile here in
[03:29:34.560 --> 03:29:38.560]  america the surveillance state says they can't even tell us what groups they're looking for
[03:29:38.560 --> 03:29:42.080]  they're just going to surveil everybody stay with us we'll be right back with more your calls

[03:29:48.240 --> 03:29:56.640]  back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:01.120 --> 03:30:05.440]  russia is pointing out there won't be any peace in syria as long as the obama administration
[03:30:05.440 --> 03:30:09.840]  keeps sending weapons to the isis linked out in those front the russian government said the militants
[03:30:09.840 --> 03:30:15.520]  are armed by tanks apc's filled artillery multiple rocket launchers and heavy weaponry and of course
[03:30:15.520 --> 03:30:19.280]  they could have made these weapons themselves nor could they have stolen all of them from the syrian
[03:30:19.280 --> 03:30:23.760]  army especially not the american made tomas hold that jihadi's used to destroy russian helicopter
[03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:28.800]  last year russians also pointed out that the us led airstrike that killed 62 syrian soldiers has
[03:30:28.800 --> 03:30:33.760]  directly led to isis gaining ground in other words the us just served as isis's air force the
[03:30:33.760 --> 03:30:38.400]  us state department has claimed the attack was an accident however fax points the contrary the
[03:30:38.400 --> 03:30:42.480]  region where the attack occurred has always been under syrian army control with no prior presence
[03:30:42.480 --> 03:30:47.280]  of isis sent com even had the audacity to release a statement claiming they have not bombed the area
[03:30:47.280 --> 03:30:52.000]  in the past but that's completely false unless they were targeting the syrian government stay

[03:33:31.060 --> 03:33:40.740]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, September 26, 2016, the day of the
[03:33:40.740 --> 03:33:43.860]  first debate between Hillary and Donald Trump.
[03:33:43.860 --> 03:33:47.000]  That's going to be an amazing debate tonight, and we've got a lot of people who've called
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:48.000]  in to talk about this.
[03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:50.900]  We're going to go to Eric in Oklahoma in just a moment, but before we do, I want to tell
[03:33:50.900 --> 03:33:56.580]  you real quickly, we've extended these two sales for several days, the 20% off Supermail
[03:33:56.580 --> 03:33:59.320]  Vitality and the 20% off Secret 12.
[03:33:59.320 --> 03:34:01.520]  Those are both going to end tonight.
[03:34:01.520 --> 03:34:08.020]  Again, that's Secret 12, our B12 formulation that's a liquid form that's very easy to
[03:34:08.020 --> 03:34:11.620]  assimilate, as well as 20% off Supermail Vitality.
[03:34:11.620 --> 03:34:16.800]  Both of those will end tonight, but we also have a Reclaiming Liberty Presidential Debate
[03:34:16.800 --> 03:34:17.800]  Special.
[03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:20.040]  This is free shipping store-wide.
[03:34:20.040 --> 03:34:24.000]  That's perhaps the biggest discount that you can get, and that goes along with our releasing
[03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:29.320]  the very first ever probiotic product that we've had here at InfowarsLife.com, Biome
[03:34:29.320 --> 03:34:30.320]  Defense.
[03:34:30.320 --> 03:34:31.880]  Take a look at this.
[03:34:31.880 --> 03:34:34.360]  As we've said, for years, people have been asking about this.
[03:34:34.360 --> 03:34:38.560]  I've been asking about this because we take probiotics, and I wanted to make sure that
[03:34:38.560 --> 03:34:40.960]  we had one here.
[03:34:40.960 --> 03:34:44.080]  It's a new product that we have called Biome Defense.
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:46.600]  Look at InfowarsLife.com to read about that.
[03:34:46.600 --> 03:34:51.180]  It's very important that you get probiotics.
[03:34:51.180 --> 03:34:54.480]  We hear all the time about antibiotics, but now you need probiotics.
[03:34:54.480 --> 03:34:58.200]  The bacteria can be very, very beneficial.
[03:34:58.200 --> 03:35:03.400]  Yogurt is just one small, familiar example about that, the culture that's in yogurt,
[03:35:03.400 --> 03:35:06.480]  but there's a lot more to it than that.
[03:35:06.480 --> 03:35:10.640]  That's our new product, but the key thing is free shipping store-wide as part of our
[03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:13.720]  Reclaiming Liberty Presidential Debate Special.
[03:35:13.720 --> 03:35:18.000]  And tonight, it ends 20% off those two products that we've had on sale, Supermail Vitality
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:19.000]  and Secret 12.
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:20.320]  Let's go to Eric in Oklahoma.
[03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:21.320]  Tell me.
[03:35:21.320 --> 03:35:22.320]  Want to comment on the debates?
[03:35:22.320 --> 03:35:23.320]  You've been holding a long time.
[03:35:23.320 --> 03:35:24.320]  Thank you, Eric.
[03:35:24.320 --> 03:35:25.320]  Good afternoon, Mr. Knight.
[03:35:25.320 --> 03:35:26.320]  Hi.
[03:35:26.320 --> 03:35:30.320]  I just want to say, I'm not too worried about the debates tonight, because you've heard
[03:35:30.320 --> 03:35:33.920]  the saying, always tell the truth, and you'll never have to remember anything.
[03:35:33.920 --> 03:35:34.920]  That's right.
[03:35:34.920 --> 03:35:37.560]  That's why she's been studying for a week, because she's got a lot to remember.
[03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:39.240]  She's got all these convoluted lies.
[03:35:39.240 --> 03:35:41.240]  She's got all these positions she's changed on.
[03:35:41.240 --> 03:35:43.360]  It's like, what do I believe?
[03:35:43.360 --> 03:35:44.360]  What did I tell them I believe?
[03:35:44.360 --> 03:35:45.360]  I don't know.
[03:35:45.360 --> 03:35:50.720]  But I remember their whole career, her and her husband, that they've never, I don't think
[03:35:50.720 --> 03:35:54.600]  they've ever told the truth on any, I don't think they've even ever answered a question
[03:35:54.600 --> 03:35:56.080]  without beating around the bush.
[03:35:56.080 --> 03:35:59.880]  But, and you know, Donald Trump, Mr. Trump, he's got that covered.
[03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:02.240]  He doesn't need me to tell him what to go on Hillary about it.
[03:36:02.240 --> 03:36:03.520]  I mean, he's got it covered.
[03:36:03.520 --> 03:36:07.920]  I've been watching his speeches about every night for the last eight months, and you know,
[03:36:07.920 --> 03:36:10.200]  he doesn't need me, and he can handle hecklers.
[03:36:10.200 --> 03:36:12.480]  He can handle all that.
[03:36:12.480 --> 03:36:18.040]  You know, so I'm, I'm just, what I'm concerned about is everybody is so fixated on Hillary's
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:19.040]  health.
[03:36:19.040 --> 03:36:21.960]  And I guess the military calls it, watch for the faint.
[03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:27.880]  You know, what, you know, everybody's so directed on her health, well, I just, what,
[03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:28.880]  they could pull something.
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:32.440]  I mean, you know, watch for something, you know, because Larry Nichols always says they
[03:36:32.440 --> 03:36:36.640]  like the Clintons, always like to run from an underdog position.
[03:36:36.640 --> 03:36:39.120]  What better than the health issue?
[03:36:39.120 --> 03:36:43.440]  And I know there's contacts and everything, and the secret service and all that, but I'm
[03:36:43.440 --> 03:36:46.880]  just, I, you know, I'm keeping a one eye open.
[03:36:46.880 --> 03:36:49.120]  Oh, no, she may turn that to her advantage.
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:53.120]  I've said in past, she'll lie, even when the truth would serve her better.
[03:36:53.120 --> 03:36:57.280]  She may want to come out at some point and pretend that she's weak, you know, I mean,
[03:36:57.280 --> 03:36:59.440]  like I said before, you know, it's to make a wish foundation.
[03:36:59.440 --> 03:37:00.440]  Let's do one for Hillary.
[03:37:00.440 --> 03:37:04.400]  Let's, let's put her in the Guinness Book of Records as the, the first woman to get
[03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:07.640]  elected president or something like that, that she might turn it that way.
[03:37:07.640 --> 03:37:09.440]  She's like, Hey guys, I haven't got that long to live.
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:10.920]  So let's just do this one for me.
[03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:13.360]  I don't know if she'll do that or not.
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:15.520]  That's going to be hard for them to walk it back now.
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:20.600]  They have doubled down so many times on the lie that she has pneumonia, non contagious
[03:37:20.600 --> 03:37:23.280]  bacterial pneumonia, something that never exists.
[03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:27.160]  But of course her entire staff came down with a non contagious bacterial pneumonia at the
[03:37:27.160 --> 03:37:28.160]  same time.
[03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:29.160]  Okay.
[03:37:29.160 --> 03:37:30.160]  Thank you, Eric.
[03:37:30.160 --> 03:37:35.160]  Before I go to the other callers, I want to real quickly show you something that's not
[03:37:35.160 --> 03:37:37.160]  going to be on the debate tonight.
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:43.240]  And that's Gary Johnson, libertarian candidate, and he was talking to reporters from MSNBC,
[03:37:43.240 --> 03:37:44.240]  Casey Hunt.
[03:37:44.240 --> 03:37:48.360]  They were doing an interview on the, on the bench, which is kind of strange.
[03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:53.720]  And he's talking about why he should be in the interview and in the, in the debates.
[03:37:53.720 --> 03:37:56.840]  And then he does something absolutely amazing.
[03:37:56.840 --> 03:37:57.840]  Watch this.
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:02.360]  Do you think if you were able to get on the debate stage that you could pull even with
[03:38:02.360 --> 03:38:03.360]  Trump and Clinton in these polls?
[03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:04.360]  I do.
[03:38:04.360 --> 03:38:09.440]  And, and it wouldn't be, it wouldn't have anything to do with my debate performance either.
[03:38:09.440 --> 03:38:13.840]  It would just be that people would recognize that there's another choice and that there
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:20.000]  would be an examination of me and Bill Weld as, as who we are and what we've done and
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:21.000]  not based on that.
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:26.760]  I think I could sign up there for the whole debate and not say anything and I'm very
[03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:35.360]  excited about that.
[03:38:35.360 --> 03:38:37.880]  And he's sticking his tongue out and he's doing that and she jumps back.
[03:38:37.880 --> 03:38:39.080]  The reporter jumps back, is startled and they come back and they go, what did he do?
[03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:40.840]  Let's play that again.
[03:38:40.840 --> 03:38:42.920]  That's the awkwardness of, of Gary Johnson.
[03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:49.720]  And you know, we can, we can excuse the, the personal idiosyncrasies of people and
[03:38:49.720 --> 03:38:52.280]  he certainly has his idiosyncrasies.
[03:38:52.280 --> 03:38:59.560]  But not based on that, I think I could sign up there for the whole debate and not say
[03:38:59.560 --> 03:39:02.760]  anything and I'm very excited about what he's done.
[03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:03.760]  Thank you, Gary.
[03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:08.760]  You have been comic relief for this, this presidential election.
[03:39:08.760 --> 03:39:09.760]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:12.960]  Now it wasn't as startling, I guess, as the big fat guy that stripped down to his G-string
[03:39:12.960 --> 03:39:19.680]  at the LP convention, but look, let's understand that, that Gary Johnson, like I said before,
[03:39:19.680 --> 03:39:21.160]  when Alex was on.
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:24.760]  The bad things about Donald Trump are the bad things about Gary Johnson, about Hillary
[03:39:24.760 --> 03:39:25.760]  Clinton and so forth.
[03:39:25.760 --> 03:39:31.080]  He's taken all these positions to essentially be a globalist, to essentially be a Democrat.
[03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:34.880]  And he's actually taking more votes from Hillary Clinton than he is from Donald Trump when
[03:39:34.880 --> 03:39:37.240]  people look at what he's, he's saying.
[03:39:37.240 --> 03:39:40.760]  He's thrown the constitution, the second amendment, private property.
[03:39:40.760 --> 03:39:46.440]  He's done those things under the bus, pandering to the very same globalist that fund Hillary
[03:39:46.440 --> 03:39:50.800]  Clinton saying at the convention, he needed to get Bill Weld because he knew people.
[03:39:50.800 --> 03:39:53.360]  He was connected and he had money.
[03:39:53.360 --> 03:39:59.520]  Look, the LP, and I'm not talking about just these two candidates, but the LP in general.
[03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:02.520]  The people who run that party have sold out.
[03:40:02.520 --> 03:40:08.000]  What they want to do is get 5% of the vote in the election so they can get taxpayer funding.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:09.000]  That's pathetic.
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:12.600]  When I was with the LP, we would ask that to somebody who's running for president, so
[03:40:12.600 --> 03:40:15.040]  would you take matching funds?
[03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:17.120]  And if they said yes, that was a disqualifier.
[03:40:17.120 --> 03:40:20.960]  Now that is the reason that they're doing everything.
[03:40:20.960 --> 03:40:23.720]  And they're throwing the second amendment and other issues just under the bus because
[03:40:23.720 --> 03:40:26.560]  they could care less about the principles of individual liberty.
[03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:32.000]  Look, you either take all of individual liberty seriously and together, or you lose it all.
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:35.560]  You can't just pick and choose which ideas of liberty you're going to have.
[03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:38.680]  And so, at least with Donald Trump on the things that we'd like, he is the only one
[03:40:38.680 --> 03:40:40.040]  who is saying that.
[03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:44.480]  And I believe that he is honest enough that we at least have a chance to try to convince
[03:40:44.480 --> 03:40:48.680]  him on the things that we disagree with him on, that we believe he's wrong on.
[03:40:48.680 --> 03:40:49.680]  Civil liberties issues.
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:53.640]  We can at least get his ear and talk to him and have a fair hearing.
[03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:55.040]  You're not going to get that from Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:55.040 --> 03:40:58.080]  I don't think you're going to get that from these people who simply want money from Wall
[03:40:58.080 --> 03:40:59.080]  Street.
[03:40:59.080 --> 03:41:01.560]  And one of the things that Newt Gingrich put out, and I'm going to go back to the callers
[03:41:01.560 --> 03:41:06.720]  in just a moment here, but one of the things that Gingrich tweeted out over the weekend,
[03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:11.920]  and remember, Gingrich is very, very clever, very insightful.
[03:41:11.920 --> 03:41:12.920]  He's still a globalist.
[03:41:12.920 --> 03:41:17.600]  He's still very dangerous, but he's clever, and that makes him even more dangerous.
[03:41:17.600 --> 03:41:20.680]  But one of the things that he tweeted out this weekend, and I think he was exactly right
[03:41:20.680 --> 03:41:22.080]  on it, this is his tweet.
[03:41:22.080 --> 03:41:26.440]  He said, Clinton is a fox who knows many things that you can fact check.
[03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:30.400]  Trump is a hedgehog who knows one very big thing.
[03:41:30.400 --> 03:41:31.880]  We need change.
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:38.080]  Now, he's referring back to this parable of a hedgehog and the fox, the idea that there
[03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:39.560]  are different types of people.
[03:41:39.560 --> 03:41:44.800]  Some people are foxes, policy wonks, that type of thing, and we're going to be fact
[03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:49.080]  checking Hillary the fox tonight, because that's what she's going to be doing probably.
[03:41:49.080 --> 03:41:53.520]  She's going to be coming out with all these detailed things to show just how experienced
[03:41:53.520 --> 03:41:57.680]  and knowledgeable she is, even though, as we mentioned just a few minutes ago, she set
[03:41:57.680 --> 03:42:02.680]  the Middle East on fire, and her policies have been an absolute failure.
[03:42:02.680 --> 03:42:06.440]  But she's going to talk about all the many details that she knows.
[03:42:06.440 --> 03:42:09.600]  Donald Trump, on the other hand, is the guy who knows one very big thing.
[03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:15.400]  And quite frankly, it's not just that we need change, it's about globalism.
[03:42:15.400 --> 03:42:21.240]  The one very big thing that Donald Trump knows is that globalism is killing people in every
[03:42:21.240 --> 03:42:22.240]  country.
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:27.840]  That's why tonight's debate is going to be watched by so many people worldwide.
[03:42:27.840 --> 03:42:32.800]  Because like the Super Bowl, it is a global event because the same issues facing us here
[03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:39.760]  in America are facing people in Britain, facing people in France, in Germany, Italy, Greece.
[03:42:39.760 --> 03:42:45.320]  And that is, are we going to allow a small group, a small globalist cabal, to control
[03:42:45.320 --> 03:42:52.800]  our lives this one-tenth of one-tenth of one-tenth percent to control us, to destroy our lives?
[03:42:52.800 --> 03:42:56.360]  Or are we going to stand up and take our countries back?
[03:42:56.360 --> 03:42:59.400]  I think one thing really came through today.
[03:42:59.400 --> 03:43:05.280]  According to this New York Times article from today, September 26th, besieged globalists
[03:43:05.280 --> 03:43:06.480]  ponder what went wrong.
[03:43:06.480 --> 03:43:09.040]  This was on the Dredge Report earlier today.
[03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:12.920]  The very first statement, listen to this, starts out in this article.
[03:43:12.920 --> 03:43:14.240]  Globalists are wondering what went wrong.
[03:43:14.240 --> 03:43:18.520]  And they say, until recently, you didn't hear people being referred to as globalists very
[03:43:18.520 --> 03:43:19.520]  often.
[03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:20.520]  That's right.
[03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:21.520]  Now they're owning it.
[03:43:21.520 --> 03:43:24.560]  Who was talking about them being globalists?
[03:43:24.560 --> 03:43:25.560]  It was Alex Jones.
[03:43:25.560 --> 03:43:26.920]  It was Info Wars.
[03:43:26.920 --> 03:43:30.280]  And there was a few other outlets that were talking about this, but not the mainstream
[03:43:30.280 --> 03:43:31.280]  media.
[03:43:31.280 --> 03:43:32.280]  Certainly not the globalists themselves.
[03:43:32.280 --> 03:43:33.600]  They didn't refer to themselves as globalists.
[03:43:33.600 --> 03:43:35.600]  They would scoff at that.
[03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:36.760]  They would laugh if you'd call.
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:38.880]  They would call you a conspiracy theorist.
[03:43:38.880 --> 03:43:43.920]  You know, we'd go to cover Bilderberg and the globalists, oh, globalists, you're a bunch
[03:43:43.920 --> 03:43:47.320]  of conspiracy theorists, and now they own up to it.
[03:43:47.320 --> 03:43:52.240]  Not a day goes by that we don't see the president of the European Union or Barack Obama at the
[03:43:52.240 --> 03:43:57.080]  U.N. saying, well, you've got to do something or the IMF, okay, the president of the IMF,
[03:43:57.080 --> 03:44:01.160]  all of them saying, you know, people just think that globalism isn't serving them very
[03:44:01.160 --> 03:44:02.160]  well.
[03:44:02.160 --> 03:44:03.160]  We have to convince them that it is.
[03:44:03.160 --> 03:44:07.200]  We have to tell them some lies and convince them what's going on.
[03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:11.040]  But it goes on to say, you just didn't hear people referring to globalists very often.
[03:44:11.040 --> 03:44:13.600]  They certainly didn't do that referring to themselves.
[03:44:13.600 --> 03:44:18.720]  He said, but in a time of rising nationalism, those who see the upside of globalism have
[03:44:18.720 --> 03:44:21.040]  become a distinct, often embattled tribe.
[03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:25.880]  He said, last week, the globalists had a big family reunion in New York.
[03:44:25.880 --> 03:44:26.880]  This is New York Times.
[03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:29.400]  This is great writing because it's exactly what they did.
[03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:30.400]  And who was there?
[03:44:30.400 --> 03:44:31.400]  They were at the United Nations.
[03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:32.400]  Okay.
[03:44:32.400 --> 03:44:37.560]  All the people, except for Donald Trump, he said, the globalists have lofty aims, of course,
[03:44:37.560 --> 03:44:39.920]  like working toward a climate change agreement.
[03:44:39.920 --> 03:44:40.920]  And that's the key.
[03:44:40.920 --> 03:44:42.440]  That's the next thing I'll talk to you about here.
[03:44:42.440 --> 03:44:46.160]  Finding a solution for the refugee crisis and deepening cross-border trade.
[03:44:46.160 --> 03:44:49.440]  See, that's how they're going to take us down.
[03:44:49.440 --> 03:44:51.200]  Haven't I said that many times?
[03:44:51.200 --> 03:44:55.160]  The path to global government is those three things, right?
[03:44:55.160 --> 03:44:56.560]  Climate change.
[03:44:56.560 --> 03:45:03.680]  That's how you create a global problem and then have to have a global governance to address
[03:45:03.680 --> 03:45:04.680]  that problem.
[03:45:04.680 --> 03:45:05.680]  So problem solution.
[03:45:05.680 --> 03:45:07.720]  We've got a global problem.
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:10.800]  We've got carbon dioxide being exhaled by animals.
[03:45:10.800 --> 03:45:11.800]  How are we going to deal with this?
[03:45:11.800 --> 03:45:16.760]  We need a global government and we need a global tax that we can fund that global government
[03:45:16.760 --> 03:45:17.760]  with.
[03:45:17.760 --> 03:45:19.800]  Well, we're going to discourage that activity of exhaling.
[03:45:19.800 --> 03:45:23.240]  I'm going to tell you how they're going to stop the exhaling in just a moment.
[03:45:23.240 --> 03:45:24.360]  So that's one thing.
[03:45:24.360 --> 03:45:25.360]  Climate change.
[03:45:25.360 --> 03:45:27.640]  The next thing is the open borders, okay?
[03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:34.680]  And the third thing are the across-the-border trade deals, the Trans-Pacific, Transatlantic
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:39.000]  partnerships, private public partnerships, crony capitalism.
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:42.760]  Actually, fascist capitalism, if you want to call it that.
[03:45:42.760 --> 03:45:47.400]  Fascism is economic fascism by these people who write the rules who will control all the
[03:45:47.400 --> 03:45:52.720]  world's economies, decide who will be allowed to have an economy and who won't.
[03:45:52.720 --> 03:45:54.280]  This is what's going to, this is what this is about.
[03:45:54.280 --> 03:45:55.840]  This is not about free trade.
[03:45:55.840 --> 03:46:02.200]  It's about a small cabal taking over the world's trade, creating economic chaos and saying
[03:46:02.200 --> 03:46:05.160]  we need more political control to deal with this chaos.
[03:46:05.160 --> 03:46:06.160]  It goes on.
[03:46:06.160 --> 03:46:10.800]  He said, take the valedictory address of former President Bill Clinton, the Paterfamilias
[03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:12.240]  of the Globalist Reunion.
[03:46:12.240 --> 03:46:14.120]  Oh, that's it, see?
[03:46:14.120 --> 03:46:17.760]  He's the patriarch of the Globalist Reunion.
[03:46:17.760 --> 03:46:22.560]  The Clinton Global Initiative is one of the major factors in helping to transform what
[03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:29.560]  had been a weak centered on UN diplomacy into a broader Davos on the Hudson for international
[03:46:29.560 --> 03:46:30.560]  aspirations.
[03:46:30.560 --> 03:46:31.560]  You see this?
[03:46:31.560 --> 03:46:36.240]  This is the globalist cabal, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton at the center of it, the Clinton
[03:46:36.240 --> 03:46:41.640]  Global Initiative at the center of it, talking about how they are going to create a globalist
[03:46:41.640 --> 03:46:43.480]  government out of those three things.
[03:46:43.480 --> 03:46:48.240]  The climate change agreement, the open borders, and the so-called trade deals, which are actually
[03:46:48.240 --> 03:46:50.120]  economic domination deals.
[03:46:50.120 --> 03:46:56.080]  They say, Mr. Clinton spoke of the globalist vision of a non-zero sum world in which everyone
[03:46:56.080 --> 03:47:02.400]  wins and how that idea was under attack by zero sum tribal politics, okay?
[03:47:02.400 --> 03:47:08.160]  And this man is an absolute total liar when he says, hey, these guys over here, they're
[03:47:08.160 --> 03:47:13.600]  offering us a zero sum game, but we have a system here where everybody wins.
[03:47:13.600 --> 03:47:17.440]  No, under globalism, everybody has been losing.
[03:47:17.440 --> 03:47:21.520]  Every one of us is told as they're selling these deals that they wrote in secret.
[03:47:21.520 --> 03:47:25.160]  Everyone, every nation, here's the same story from their trade representatives.
[03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:28.000]  Oh, you're going to, you know, we did a great deal for you.
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:31.280]  You're going to, this country is going to be so much better off than the rest of the
[03:47:31.280 --> 03:47:32.280]  countries.
[03:47:32.280 --> 03:47:33.520]  We won in this trade deal.
[03:47:33.520 --> 03:47:35.400]  Every country is hearing that.
[03:47:35.400 --> 03:47:36.400]  And we're not all winners.
[03:47:36.400 --> 03:47:39.040]  Okay, this isn't like we'll be gone, okay?
[03:47:39.040 --> 03:47:42.560]  Actually the reality is we're all losers.
[03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:45.480]  And there's another story that came out on Friday that ties into this.
[03:47:45.480 --> 03:47:50.680]  When you don't talk about the zero sum game, they want to zero out our population.
[03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:52.720]  This is a story from Friday.
[03:47:52.720 --> 03:47:54.320]  Want a slow climate change?
[03:47:54.320 --> 03:47:55.480]  Stop having babies.
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:47:56.480]  This is on Bloomberg.
[03:47:56.480 --> 03:48:00.320]  And again, it goes back to the climate change deal to global governance.
[03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:02.880]  They say carbon dioxide doesn't kill climates.
[03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:04.080]  People do.
[03:48:04.080 --> 03:48:08.480]  And the world would be better off with fewer of them.
[03:48:08.480 --> 03:48:10.800]  People are killing their precious climate.
[03:48:10.800 --> 03:48:15.920]  These are the people who could not decide on September 11th, 2016, when they tried to
[03:48:15.920 --> 03:48:19.880]  create the initial lie of Hillary Clinton's that she had been overheated.
[03:48:19.880 --> 03:48:22.000]  They could not decide on the temperature.
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:24.920]  They were given the temperature plus or minus 10 degrees.
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:25.920]  Literally.
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:29.360]  I mean, some people were saying everything from the mid-70s to the mid-80s.
[03:48:29.360 --> 03:48:30.800]  It was 78 degrees.
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:37.680]  I took a photo of the temperature at that particular time in New York and saved it.
[03:48:37.680 --> 03:48:39.920]  What we heard as much as 85 degrees.
[03:48:39.920 --> 03:48:44.920]  These are the same people that tell us who can't accurately measure and report the temperature
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:50.200]  on the same day are telling us that in decades, we're going to have a one degree change in
[03:48:50.200 --> 03:48:52.160]  temperature and that's going to destroy the world.
[03:48:52.160 --> 03:48:54.120]  So therefore, we need to have global governance.
[03:48:54.120 --> 03:48:56.960]  We need to shut down all of our energy production.
[03:48:56.960 --> 03:49:00.600]  And then they go on to say they've got this new thing called the Kaia identity.
[03:49:00.600 --> 03:49:07.040]  Very much like the Gaia theory, they always come up with these bogus ideas to sell their
[03:49:07.040 --> 03:49:08.040]  bogus theories.
[03:49:08.040 --> 03:49:12.280]  They say, we've got to look at how much energy the economy needs to produce GDP, how much
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:16.040]  GDP per capita people are consuming and the population.
[03:49:16.040 --> 03:49:19.000]  And then they lay this out, Eric Rosten on Bloomberg.
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:24.520]  He says, after years of policy makers yammering about carbon light or carbon free, this or
[03:49:24.520 --> 03:49:30.080]  that, writer basically zeros in on the fact that nobody wants to acknowledge the number
[03:49:30.080 --> 03:49:34.640]  of people in the world, particularly in affluent countries is literally a part of the equation.
[03:49:34.640 --> 03:49:36.200]  How long have they been saying this?
[03:49:36.200 --> 03:49:38.000]  They've been saying this for a very long time.
[03:49:38.000 --> 03:49:40.680]  They said the media doesn't want to use that word.
[03:49:40.680 --> 03:49:43.080]  Just like they didn't want to talk about globalists, they didn't want to talk about
[03:49:43.080 --> 03:49:49.280]  how their real agenda is global governance and population, depopulation of the earth,
[03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:50.280]  population control.
[03:49:50.280 --> 03:49:55.160]  If they get it, take the population count down before they can actually effectively
[03:49:55.160 --> 03:49:58.920]  control you, force you into the cities, okay?
[03:49:58.920 --> 03:50:02.040]  And so that's the bottom line with all of this.
[03:50:02.040 --> 03:50:07.280]  That is the real, real single thing that the hedgehog needs to know and needs to understand
[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:08.280]  tonight.
[03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:09.880]  Hedgehog, Donald Trump.
[03:50:09.880 --> 03:50:15.160]  He needs to understand that it is globalism that is destroying America and the rest of
[03:50:15.160 --> 03:50:16.160]  the world.
[03:50:16.160 --> 03:50:17.160]  And he does understand that.
[03:50:17.160 --> 03:50:22.520]  He said this election is about globalism versus nationalism or Americanism, okay?
[03:50:22.520 --> 03:50:27.560]  Why would we have a system that is not in our best interest?
[03:50:27.560 --> 03:50:29.560]  And that's the system that is being sold to everybody.
[03:50:29.560 --> 03:50:31.240]  They're selling a system to the British.
[03:50:31.240 --> 03:50:32.760]  That's not in the British best interest.
[03:50:32.760 --> 03:50:33.760]  They sell it to the Germans.
[03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:36.760]  It's not in the Germans' best interest, or the French, or the Americans.
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:42.240]  But it's in the best interest of these people who were meeting with the Clintons last week
[03:50:42.240 --> 03:50:44.880]  in New York, the globalists.
[03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:46.440]  Now they call themselves globalists.
[03:50:46.440 --> 03:50:47.440]  Okay, stay with us.
[03:50:47.440 --> 03:50:50.520]  When we come back, we're going to finish up with the people who are still hanging on.
[03:50:50.520 --> 03:50:51.520]  Thank you for hanging on, folks.
[03:50:51.520 --> 03:50:55.640]  We'll be right back with more of your calls about tonight's big debate.
[03:50:55.640 --> 03:50:56.640]  What's going to happen?
[03:50:56.640 --> 03:50:57.640]  Let's see.
[03:50:57.640 --> 03:50:58.640]  Get your opinions when we come back.
[03:50:58.640 --> 03:51:01.640]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.640 --> 03:51:07.800]  Extendivite, a seven-herb combination of garlic, cayenne, hawthorne, bilberry, ginko bloba,
[03:51:07.800 --> 03:51:10.240]  balearion, and milk thistle.
[03:51:10.240 --> 03:51:14.200]  Extendivite is designed to strengthen the heart and arteries and help the body heal
[03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:15.200]  itself.
[03:51:15.200 --> 03:51:19.520]  Doctors are not able to explain the improvements they are seeing in their patient's health
[03:51:19.520 --> 03:51:21.680]  who are taking Extendivite.
[03:51:21.680 --> 03:51:26.200]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better.
[03:51:26.200 --> 03:51:31.160]  Due to the unexplainable improvements in their patient's health, more doctors are calling
[03:51:31.160 --> 03:51:34.040]  to order Extendivite for themselves.
[03:51:34.040 --> 03:51:37.120]  Help Extendivite make your doctor a believer.
[03:51:37.120 --> 03:51:42.160]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two-month supply.
[03:51:42.160 --> 03:52:00.600]  To get started, call 1-877-928-8822 that's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:52:00.600 --> 03:52:02.560]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:52:02.560 --> 03:52:06.960]  Investment Rarities, a 43-year-old company, has created the best silver offer ever.
[03:52:06.960 --> 03:52:12.240]  The U.S. Silver Eagle, Canadian Maple Leaf, Austrian Philharmonic, OPM Pure Bar, and Silver
[03:52:12.240 --> 03:52:15.800]  Round have all five for $99 post-paid.
[03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:18.760]  You heard me right, five ounces of silver below cost.
[03:52:18.760 --> 03:52:21.200]  No credit card fees, free shipping.
[03:52:21.200 --> 03:52:25.640]  Just $99 and you'll have a great start on what it takes to survive even the worst economic
[03:52:25.640 --> 03:52:26.640]  storm.

[03:52:40.360 --> 03:52:41.880]  The secret is being suppressed.
[03:52:41.880 --> 03:52:44.200]  The price could explode at any time.
[03:52:44.200 --> 03:52:47.000]  Call today at 800-328-1860.
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:50.360]  Get five ounces of silver for only $99.

[03:52:56.080 --> 03:52:59.960]  Call now before it's too late, 800-328-1860.
[03:52:59.960 --> 03:53:04.800]  Dr. Waddle Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how sales breathe.
[03:53:04.800 --> 03:53:07.680]  He also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells.
[03:53:07.680 --> 03:53:11.240]  He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency.
[03:53:11.240 --> 03:53:15.560]  Dr. Joanna Budwig, built upon the work of Dr. Warburg, had discovered how to feed the
[03:53:15.560 --> 03:53:18.360]  cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency.
[03:53:18.360 --> 03:53:22.040]  She found that it was a sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax
[03:53:22.040 --> 03:53:26.160]  oil that the flax oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed.
[03:53:26.160 --> 03:53:30.200]  Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of
[03:53:30.200 --> 03:53:31.200]  the body.
[03:53:31.200 --> 03:53:34.960]  Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality, zero
[03:53:34.960 --> 03:53:36.960]  oxidation, undamaged seed oils.
[03:53:36.960 --> 03:53:39.960]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing.
[03:53:39.960 --> 03:53:43.920]  Now add our life force enhanced one-world-weight protein powder that is much higher in the
[03:53:43.920 --> 03:53:48.680]  sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is and you have a winning combination to confer
[03:53:48.680 --> 03:53:50.880]  health and energy like never before.
[03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:56.720]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit sacredseedoils.com.
[03:53:56.720 --> 03:54:26.600]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and of course tonight is the
[03:54:26.600 --> 03:54:30.440]  big debate and we're going to get some more phone calls and comments on here in just one
[03:54:30.440 --> 03:54:31.440]  moment before we do.
[03:54:31.440 --> 03:54:36.560]  I want to remind you that we have a new product at infowarslife.com, Biome Defense.
[03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:44.080]  This is a superior blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from 23 different probiotic
[03:54:44.080 --> 03:54:45.080]  strains.
[03:54:45.080 --> 03:54:48.720]  These are all known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:51.280]  This is something that is very important for your health.
[03:54:51.280 --> 03:54:58.280]  It's one of the reasons that people are so big on fermented things like yogurt and kumbachka
[03:54:58.280 --> 03:54:59.480]  and other things like that.
[03:54:59.480 --> 03:55:01.960]  You need probiotics, okay?
[03:55:01.960 --> 03:55:07.600]  So take a look at this new product, find out about that and we also have free shipping
[03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:09.080]  to go along with that.
[03:55:09.080 --> 03:55:13.440]  Free shipping store-wide, not just on the new product, Biome Defense, but on everything
[03:55:13.440 --> 03:55:17.360]  at the store we have put on free shipping as part of our reclaiming liberty presidential
[03:55:17.360 --> 03:55:18.760]  debate special.
[03:55:18.760 --> 03:55:24.880]  And tonight is the last night, we have 20% off Supermail Vitality and 20% off Secret
[03:55:24.880 --> 03:55:29.920]  12, Vitamin B12, all of those at infowarslife.com.
[03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:33.280]  Let's go back to our callers right now, Mike in England.
[03:55:33.280 --> 03:55:34.280]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:55:34.280 --> 03:55:35.280]  Hello, David.
[03:55:35.280 --> 03:55:37.280]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:55:37.280 --> 03:55:38.280]  Sure.
[03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:39.280]  Go ahead.
[03:55:39.280 --> 03:55:40.280]  Yeah.
[03:55:40.280 --> 03:55:41.280]  Two things.
[03:55:41.280 --> 03:55:48.280]  One, you were talking about global warming and all that and that's all a bunch of nonsense.
[03:55:48.280 --> 03:55:52.720]  One of the reasons why we have the global warming is because it's monoculture farming,
[03:55:52.720 --> 03:55:54.720]  crop farming practices.
[03:55:54.720 --> 03:56:00.240]  And I don't know if you know who Joe Stadeline is, but he's quoted as saying that, you know,
[03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:07.880]  and he describes what is called pasture cropping and one of his assertions is that if we went
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:13.080]  over to a pasture cropping system, we get far more productivity, we wouldn't be using
[03:56:13.080 --> 03:56:19.000]  Monsanto products, but if we centralize control of everything, including our farming, that
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:20.720]  means we're only going to take one approach.
[03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:23.280]  If that approach is wrong, we're all dead.
[03:56:23.280 --> 03:56:26.840]  If you don't have centralized control, you can have multiple approaches.
[03:56:26.840 --> 03:56:29.840]  That's one of the reasons we have a federal system here in the United States.
[03:56:29.840 --> 03:56:34.160]  The idea was that we wouldn't do everything in a top-down centralized manner.
[03:56:34.160 --> 03:56:37.400]  Not only corrupt politicians, but it functionally doesn't work.
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:40.480]  You need to be able to have a lot of different approaches so people can see what's working
[03:56:40.480 --> 03:56:46.880]  and what isn't working and you don't put all of your eggs in one central basket that crashes.
[03:56:46.880 --> 03:56:49.160]  Are you going to be watching the debate tonight in England?
[03:56:49.160 --> 03:56:50.160]  Oh, I certainly will.
[03:56:50.160 --> 03:56:55.000]  But the point I was going to make on that is what he's saying is that if we change the
[03:56:55.000 --> 03:56:59.600]  farming practices that we have, you would sequester all the carbon dioxide, all that
[03:56:59.600 --> 03:57:04.200]  bad plant food out of the atmosphere that was generated since the beginning of the Industrial
[03:57:04.200 --> 03:57:05.200]  Revolution.
[03:57:05.200 --> 03:57:11.520]  Yeah, I'm not too worried about climate change, I'm worried about globalism.
[03:57:11.520 --> 03:57:13.520]  That's my key thing.
[03:57:13.520 --> 03:57:17.120]  Let's go to Mike in Louisiana because we don't have much time.
[03:57:17.120 --> 03:57:19.280]  Real quickly, Mike, we've only got less than a minute.
[03:57:19.280 --> 03:57:20.280]  Go ahead.
[03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:21.280]  About 30 seconds.
[03:57:21.280 --> 03:57:22.280]  Okay.
[03:57:22.280 --> 03:57:27.480]  I was going to say as far as Hillary Clinton's displayed a lot of bad judgment.
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:32.400]  One of the things that was really poor judgment was the support of UN Resolution 1618, which
[03:57:32.400 --> 03:57:39.800]  is effectively is the reason why they can't say radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism
[03:57:39.800 --> 03:57:46.880]  and why they basically what that did is cause all communications become sanitized according
[03:57:46.880 --> 03:57:47.880]  to Sharia.
[03:57:47.880 --> 03:57:51.760]  So we're living in a world that all our communications have to be Sharia compliant.
[03:57:51.760 --> 03:57:57.040]  Yeah, I think the key is that we don't realize, most of the public doesn't realize that the
[03:57:57.040 --> 03:58:02.360]  globalists are playing by a secret rule, the secret rules that we haven't seen.
[03:58:02.360 --> 03:58:03.360]  And that's the key thing.
[03:58:03.360 --> 03:58:04.760]  Now, this is starting to be exposed.
[03:58:04.760 --> 03:58:06.080]  We're going to see more of this tonight.
[03:58:06.080 --> 03:58:10.640]  Join us tonight for our live broadcast of the first presidential debate between Hillary
[03:58:10.640 --> 03:58:12.560]  and Donald Trump.
[03:58:12.560 --> 03:58:15.200]  And we're going to be having that live with the nightly news.
[03:58:15.200 --> 03:58:18.600]  The entire crew will be here as well as people on location in New York.
[03:58:18.600 --> 03:58:22.640]  Beginning tonight at 6 p.m. Central and starting at 6, right?
[03:58:22.640 --> 03:58:23.640]  Not 7.
[03:58:23.640 --> 03:58:27.200]  Starting at 6 p.m. Central, 7 p.m. Eastern Time.
