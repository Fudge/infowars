[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:22.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.000 --> 00:30.000]  we're going to cover the stock markets plunging around the world on fears of dollar devaluation
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  we're going to break down the police state in this country they're now trying to pass legislation to ban family farms and ranches
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  you'll have to have special government license to even grow tomatoes or plums in your backyard
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  natural news is reporting they're very very close to getting that rammed through right now that is all coming up
[00:51.000 --> 00:59.000]  but we're going to continue discussing and now into week number three week number three is almost gone
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  and we've been covering this going back three weeks ago from Wednesday of three weeks ago
[01:05.000 --> 01:15.000]  we're going to continue hammering this drum of the TSA takeover of society we're going to continue pointing this out
[01:15.000 --> 01:25.000]  because the TSA is federalizing society they are giving us training to have the government put their hands on us
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.000]  to condition us that we're all basically prisoners and if they can get away with this they can get away with anything
[01:34.000 --> 01:43.000]  it's also a lesson in brazen government bullying and intimidation
[01:43.000 --> 01:55.000]  we have joining us at about 30 minutes John tiner whose video and audio that was posted Sunday has gone viral with millions of views online
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  he was trying to fly out of southern California to go pheasant hunting on the east coast
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000]  and he said look you're not going to touch my private parts and so they said well you can leave then so he did try to leave
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.000]  and they said no now we're going to find you for leaving the screening area civilly it's all civil it's all color of law
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  that's how they get away with this and so they've been caught trying to frame him now so he's going to be joining us
[02:22.000 --> 02:31.000]  all of that is now dwarfed by the top story that's up on the drudge report drudgereport.com we have our own report on this going up
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  at prisonplanet.com the next few minutes by Steve Watson that's got some different angles to it
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  but TSA triple X naked body scans leak online
[02:43.000 --> 02:54.000]  well the issue is we already had this happen earlier this year in England when a TV star was going through and they wanted to
[02:54.000 --> 03:04.000]  have him sign a print off of his naked body the women British airport screeners did it's very similar to our TSA
[03:04.000 --> 03:16.000]  well now 100 naked citizens 100 leaked body scans now this is a less powerful system though it is revealing
[03:16.000 --> 03:26.000]  that they use at this particular courthouse federal courthouse in in Florida where they save the 35,000 images
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  and I believe this looks like a Psyop because I've seen the images in the in the test models from even this system they're using
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  and it's more detailed than what they've released here so they're putting this out they're not saying who leaked it
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  saying oh my gosh it shows you know the naked citizens but this is nothing compared to the airport
[03:46.000 --> 03:56.000]  uh scanners but this is from gizmodo and again it's linked up on drudge report the gizmodo investigations revealed 100 of the photographs saved by the gen 2
[03:56.000 --> 04:09.000]  millimeter wave scanner I'll see the airports have an actual x-ray from the brye jot image system ink obtained by a four year request after it was
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  uh recently revealed that the u.s. marshals operating machine in Orlando Florida courthouse had improperly perhaps illegally saved images
[04:17.000 --> 04:28.000]  and that is the big issue here they are saving these and we've got big sis napolitano the head of homeland security running around
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  writing news articles pressure leases for us today and we've got her doing press conferences saying we do not save the images
[04:36.000 --> 04:45.000]  in the manuals for the machines that we published over a year ago state they do save the images so they are saving the images
[04:45.000 --> 04:56.000]  the machines do save the images but there's an even bigger development when we come back but overall the globalists are in trouble
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  the people are learning how to stand up and take action that's scaring the system
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find
[05:08.000 --> 05:15.000]  work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse

[08:00.000 --> 08:08.000]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:08.000 --> 08:23.000]  the all out revolt against the naked body scanners and the invasive molestation fondling grope downs is intensifying
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.000]  time magazine has a headline saying everybody hates the TSA
[08:29.000 --> 08:37.000]  well almost everyone had always hated it and I'm gonna get into the big new developments on that front here in a moment
[08:37.000 --> 08:44.000]  in fact I told the story many times of five years ago I was down at a local TV station visiting with a friend
[08:44.000 --> 08:55.000]  and his brother is a senior person in security at the Bergstrom International Airport here in Austin, Texas
[08:55.000 --> 09:03.000]  and his brother was there and they were in their office sitting around giggling and laughing
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  he was in his brother's office saying wait wait it's about to come on and I said what's about to come on
[09:09.000 --> 09:18.000]  and he said news aid Austin he said he said we've added more security and everybody hates it
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  but he said I had to lead the news aid crew around the airport today and they sat there and talked to more than 40 people
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  who all said they hated the new security the pat downs and the rest of it this was five years ago when that had just started
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  notice they're always intensifying it and he said but then they got one old lady who said she loved it
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.000]  and he said I've got to bet with my brother that that's all they're gonna show on the news
[09:42.000 --> 09:51.000]  sure enough news aid comes on they cut to the old lady how much she loves it and he won the $20 bet against his brother
[09:51.000 --> 10:00.000]  and that's how they do it I mean they've got these newscasts of how wonderful it is to have your wife or your child have their genitals grabbed
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.000]  how wonderful how everyone loves it to fight al-qaeda no one would put up with this anywhere in the world
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  no one would put up with 500 mobile x-ray vans the feds have driving around looking through your walls
[10:12.000 --> 10:22.000]  no other governments except for Israel will use DU in warfare because it kills your own troops long term as well as the enemy
[10:22.000 --> 10:32.000]  but our government does it because they're completely out of control and completely lawless
[10:32.000 --> 10:40.000]  now there have been a bunch of big new developments here we do have john tiner who you know the famous quote of
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  you can pat me down all you want but if you touch my junk I'm gonna call the police you're gonna get arrested
[10:46.000 --> 10:54.000]  you know if you or I went to a park and ran up and grabbed a woman or a man's genitals we'd be spending probably five ten years in prison
[10:54.000 --> 11:04.000]  and we should but TSA does it and it's supposedly to keep you safe from the terrorist now on that front and you can pull this up
[11:04.000 --> 11:18.000]  at the San Diego online newspaper the San Diego Herald Tribune Union Tribune they had a press conference yesterday
[11:18.000 --> 11:28.000]  and they said how dare Mr. Tiner leave the screening area unauthorized we're gonna charge him $11,000 and the guy says with pleasure
[11:28.000 --> 11:38.000]  it was 10,000 now it's 11,000 now it just so happens he has it all recorded on audio and video they told him fine leave get out of here
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.000]  you're not allowed to fly which is their standard operating procedure if you don't put up with the grope down then he's trying to leave
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  and somebody when the suit runs out and says you're gonna be charged $10,000 for leaving a security area so they set him up
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  and said leave but they're like oh you didn't submit to us on our power trip boom getting he left the security area
[12:00.000 --> 12:12.000]  this is part of this criminal bullying arrogant culture to send a message to everyone but every newspaper article about this
[12:12.000 --> 12:20.000]  mainstream news is calling it police state thuggery recrimination we'll put that headline back up for people
[12:20.000 --> 12:30.000]  TSA to investigate body scan resistor so this guy just wants to go hunting he wants to go pheasant hunting with his father-in-law
[12:30.000 --> 12:40.000]  who's a cop by the way doesn't matter you're all slaves and they want to touch his private parts and he says no
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.000]  and so they say then leave and he's trying to leave and they run over and say you left the security area
[12:46.000 --> 12:57.000]  you know the same thing happened to York's truly in 2006 I land in Ottawa Canada the capital of Canada
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.000]  and they pull us out of line they go you're Alex Jones you're here to cover the Bilderberg group conference aren't you
[13:03.000 --> 13:14.000]  and I said yeah I am and they said well you're not going anywhere and they said if we find any pornography on your laptop computers
[13:14.000 --> 13:22.000]  and we had three of them it was myself Aaron Dykes and Ryan Slickhuisen traveling they said if we find any porn on your
[13:22.000 --> 13:30.000]  computers you're going to go to prison and I said you mean illegal porn and they go no as much as a pin-up girl
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.000]  that is trafficking and pornography you're going to federal prison here in Canada they were laughing at us
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  well I knew my computer didn't have any porn on it I crossed my fingers Aaron's Slickhuisen didn't have any and I don't know
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  what office computer probably doesn't have some on it I mean you know that stuff pops up even when you're not looking for it
[13:49.000 --> 14:00.000]  and so they spent 15 hours 15 hours going through our computers yelling at us not letting us go to the bathroom
[14:00.000 --> 14:11.000]  and I'm sitting there in the bucket seats in front of the you know office area in between being taken into rooms and
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  screamed at and interrogated and it was this you know guy on a complete power trip got with a French accent
[14:17.000 --> 14:25.000]  and they were intermittently yelling at us and then they'd find news articles on prisonplanet.com
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  showing Canadian police beating up protesters and they would say what's this were you involved in this
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  and I'm like no it's a news article like like we were criminals for having news articles about Canada
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.000]  so they were also reading prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and then Aaron looks over and says what are we going to do
[14:43.000 --> 14:50.000]  we've been here like 10 hours this is like 10 hours of the 15 plus hours it's about 16 and I said I don't know
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  I guess we're just gonna fly us back to Texas and they come running around the corner going escape escape
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  you're trying to escape we'll put you in prison for that listen to me you bleeping scumbag American
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  the guys got spit flying cuss words we're tired of you filthy Americans you scum we're tired of you coming up here
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  and bleeping all over us you filthy just like just hyperventilating all these other crazy guards behind him
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  and he goes you're gonna go to prison in Toronto you just tried to escape
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  I just laughed at him I said do whatever you want man you're trash I'm not putting up with you anymore you lunatic
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.000]  well little did they know they confiscated two of our cell phones but slick highs and have a small one
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  and I was able to call and get Jim Tucker out of bed who'd already flown in at his hotel and he got the CBC
[15:40.000 --> 15:49.000]  and other TV there and they showed up five hours later or so and that guy went from being a power tripping thug
[15:49.000 --> 15:57.000]  to groveling and saying listen I have a daughter I could get fired over this please don't talk about this when I let you go
[15:57.000 --> 16:05.000]  I'm gonna let you go but remember you've got to go back through the airport when you leave so it was also the threat
[16:05.000 --> 16:15.000]  and we have the RMCP out there they're gonna be watching you so you don't talk to the media about this if you want to get out of Canada
[16:15.000 --> 16:28.000]  so it was intermittent threats but don't get me fired my daughter and they did have these two beautiful RMCP people following us around that day
[16:28.000 --> 16:35.000]  after we got out they would drive around a mustang convertible they followed us everywhere and they'd laugh at us and wave at us they were pretty nice
[16:35.000 --> 16:43.000]  then they had some other male cops come after us but then they had other people try to set us up but the point is it was crazy
[16:43.000 --> 16:51.000]  and he was trying to say that I was trying to escape I'm sitting there totally exhausted you know flew in at nine at night
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  it had to be like five six in the morning by then we're like what are we gonna do I'm like I guess they're flying us back
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  I guess we're going back to Texas ah you're trying to escape I caught you
[17:03.000 --> 17:15.000]  this is the lunacy this is the craziness of these people and it's the exact same system in England Canada many areas of Europe the United States
[17:15.000 --> 17:23.000]  Australia New Zealand it's the same continuity of agenda the same training this is the world government system
[17:23.000 --> 17:36.000]  now you think it's bad that through a Freedom of Information Act request Gizmodo was able to get 100 images of the naked body scans
[17:36.000 --> 17:44.000]  and they admittedly stored 35,000 in Florida at one federal courthouse see these are going in public schools everywhere you think that's bad
[17:44.000 --> 17:55.000]  that's nothing there's a show called This Week in Tech with Leo Laporte I've actually heard it but it's on Clear Channel isn't it
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  I know it's big I know I hear it on local stations I know it has millions and millions of listeners
[18:00.000 --> 18:08.000]  Leo Laporte one of the his fill-in host you know who's a tech writer
[18:08.000 --> 18:25.000]  Owen J.J. Stone this is Sunday's video cast we're going to play a clip of this when we come back and he's joining us coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes from now after John Tyner comes on with us
[18:25.000 --> 18:39.000]  and I'd actually read about this but but but now it's not just enhanced pat downs for people that go don't go through scanners it's going to be enhanced pat downs for if you go through the scanners and enhance pat downs for everyone
[18:39.000 --> 18:57.000]  and so in the middle of this controversy they are now introducing something new and I didn't just believe Owen J.J. Stone even though he's a well respected tech writer and researcher
[18:57.000 --> 19:10.000]  no we did a search and found multiple newscast that are coming out simultaneously around the country where other people are complaining they now stick their hands down your pants
[19:10.000 --> 19:19.000]  they don't just run around the edge of your waistband they now stick their hands down your pants so they're now actually touching your skin
[19:19.000 --> 19:27.000]  it's not enough to grab your genitals through the pants and lift up let me make sure that in the bomb go ahead and give it a squeeze or grab your wife's breast and do it
[19:27.000 --> 19:41.000]  now they're announcing that well they're actually doing it that they're putting their hands down your pants physically touching your skin I mean they've got a blue glove on
[19:41.000 --> 19:55.000]  by the way they're not changing those blue gloves every time you talk of that's another issue the unsanitariness it's so it's horrible very unsanitary to make everybody take their shoes off and walk through the same area
[19:55.000 --> 20:11.000]  with all that athlete's foot and the rest of it it's disgusting we're right back

[21:06.000 --> 21:20.000]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt
[21:20.000 --> 21:27.000]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature from Jekyll Island

[23:57.000 --> 24:17.000]  out in the control room during the break Matt RIT guy was making the point of couldn't this spread venereal diseases like crabs
[24:17.000 --> 24:27.000]  I mean now the TSA sticks their hand down your pants inside your pants to make sure it's not a bomb and I have multiple newscasts
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  not just this talk show host Owen J.J. Stone on this weekend tech talking about it
[24:33.000 --> 24:41.000]  we have multiple newscasts it's about to go up on YouTube a boil down of some of these newscasts and this eyewitness report
[24:41.000 --> 24:48.000]  imagine if you or I didn't just run up and grab some lady at a park by her genitals are breast
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.000]  but imagine if you grab the TSA by their genitals when they're touching your genitals
[24:54.000 --> 25:01.000]  you're going to go to prison for sexual assault and none of this has to do with keeping you safe from bombs or terrorists
[25:01.000 --> 25:09.000]  it is about indoctrinating us to accept this tyranny now I want to go ahead and go to this clip from this weekend tech
[25:09.000 --> 25:17.000]  this was just this Sunday with Owen J.J. Stone he's coming up later in the next hour to break it down in more detail for us
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  but here he recounts what happened to him
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.000]  the x-ray machines and in fact I don't know they had recently or is it coming up Wednesday November 24 2010 is national opt out day
[25:29.000 --> 25:36.000]  now most people don't know on the x-ray machines you can always opt out all you have to say is I opt out and then they give you a pat down search
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  and then if we all did it I do that air traffic regardless
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  well listen maybe I know when I just flew here this weekend I wore the same sweatpants I wore last week good LA
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  this year this weekend when I came in he's like oh they just changed the rules this week do you want a private screening
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  or do you want to patch it out here and I'm like what do you mean he's like well do you want us to take you in the back room
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  or do you want to do it out here what does it entail I have to go in your waistband put my hand down your pants
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  I'm like do it out here and I stood in front of everybody and he did it
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  what's the alternative can I go through a machine
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  no the alternative is for him to go in the back room and pat I had he's going to put his hands down your pants no matter what he did
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  yes and I said I'd rather have him do it out here in public because just what Brian said he's he's already ashamed to do it
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.000]  and I feel like he's not going to go when did this happen this weekend they're required to put their hands down your pants
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  just change the rule well I put his hands on it his hands
[26:22.000 --> 26:31.000]  wait a minute I'm not necessarily good this is the this is the new TSA is that you have to get if you're wearing sweatpants
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  or baggy clothing oh baggy clothes I was wearing sweatpants they're not baggy they're sweatpants
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  he put his hand this is my waistband because I gotta tell you if I have to get my somebody hand down my pants
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  I'm not flying around the ring of my waistband and then pat at the front and then pat at my butt and then in my crotch
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  and you know it's all security theater it does absolutely nothing that's the part that kills me is that is that for all of the
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  federalization for all this giant bureaucracy for the five dollars that you have to pay for every single flight going and coming back
[26:56.000 --> 27:03.000]  everywhere you go we get not one percentage point bump and security and the guy was embarrassed to do it he says sorry like five times
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  he's like well I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry excuse me but would you like that job no horrible job all right you know it's funny
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  is anyone who follows my Twitter feed all right we're gonna have him on the show coming up in about an hour that's
[27:16.000 --> 27:26.000]  oh and JJ stone and we're gonna get an article out at prisonplanet.com in the next 30 minutes on this subject
[27:26.000 --> 27:34.000]  the TSA ladies and gentlemen now sticks their hands inside your pants now notice they've just announced this in the last
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  two weeks we found multiple newscasts separately from this due to the backlash they're like oh you don't like
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.000]  naked body scanners you don't like us touching your genitals on the outside we'll do it on the inside oh you don't
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.000]  like that we'll do a cavity search oh you don't like that we'll cut your head off you know it's just on and on and on
[27:54.000 --> 28:02.000]  pushing pushing pushing oh get out of here they told John tiner get out of here you don't get the fly then
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  he's like okay he goes and gets his ticket refunded this is on record it's all recorded it's in the
[28:08.000 --> 28:15.000]  San Diego newspapers he gets his goes and gets a ticket refund he's about to leave and a goon runs up in a suit
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.000]  and says you're not allowed to leave you tried to escape the screening area that's a ten thousand dollar fine
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  and he's like on the tape he's but you told me to go they're like it doesn't matter we're gonna get you now
[28:27.000 --> 28:36.000]  they set him up there it is TSA to investigate body scan resistor you don't like us trying to grab your crotch
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  you don't like us sticking our hand down your pants you don't like the government doing this you don't like it
[28:41.000 --> 28:48.000]  and now they have a press conference last night where the head of the TSA in San Diego he's there on the screen
[28:48.000 --> 28:57.000]  in the lower photo he comes out and says oh I'm afraid it's not ten thousand you can watch the video
[28:57.000 --> 29:06.000]  it's eleven thousand he relishes and he goes mr. tiners in a lot of trouble we're gonna get you mr. tiner
[29:06.000 --> 29:14.000]  imagine they're caught framing tiner they tell him leave go go get your ticket refunded he goes gets it refunded
[29:14.000 --> 29:22.000]  he's walking out and a guy runs up and says we got you now you left the screening area
[29:22.000 --> 29:30.000]  I mean that's why the TSA lies and says they don't save the images that's why they lie just last week and said
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  they don't touch your genitals when they put out the press release saying that they were doing it
[29:34.000 --> 29:41.000]  it's just a culture of disdaining us but America and the planet is waking up and getting angry and saying
[29:41.000 --> 29:50.000]  no no no this is the beginning of the end of the new world order you watch
[29:50.000 --> 30:00.000]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[31:04.000 --> 31:10.000]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[31:14.000 --> 31:19.000]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[31:19.000 --> 31:24.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[31:24.000 --> 31:29.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[31:34.000 --> 31:39.000]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[31:43.000 --> 31:49.000]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[31:49.000 --> 31:54.000]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the son so go to

[32:01.000 --> 32:07.000]  that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to
[32:07.000 --> 32:12.000]  find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees
[32:12.000 --> 32:16.000]  but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news
[32:16.000 --> 32:21.000]  either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition to converting your
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food savings account from
[32:25.000 --> 32:31.000]  eFoodsDirect they both make fabulous investments food is our greatest dependency and we know

[33:22.000 --> 33:28.000]  There have been many triggers throughout history to corrupt regimes being overthrown
[33:28.000 --> 33:38.000]  and fiction follows reality in the movie V for Vendetta where the little girl is wearing
[33:38.000 --> 33:48.000]  the Guy Fox mask and she runs away from the police and they shoot her in the back and
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  then the public starts rioting and taking over the government you know that's basically
[33:53.000 --> 33:59.000]  what happened with Chalcescu in Romanian they had this illusion that everybody liked the
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.000]  tyranny everybody liked the surveillance cameras everybody liked the checkpoints everybody
[34:04.000 --> 34:11.000]  liked the corruption but when people finally started standing up it was like wildfire the
[34:11.000 --> 34:19.000]  system imploded now the social engineers know this they understand that so they try to go
[34:19.000 --> 34:26.000]  provocateur violent groups to attack federal buildings or attack synagogues or attack
[34:26.000 --> 34:35.000]  children to then demonize any type of movement against tyranny so that when people organically
[34:35.000 --> 34:41.000]  stand up against oppression they could have already preemptively been painted as terrorists
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  it basically may be like saying if somebody ran away from the plantation 200 years ago
[34:47.000 --> 34:54.000]  from Alabama that they were a terrorist did they as a human being have a right to run away
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  from slavery now I don't want to have violent confrontations with the government the government
[35:01.000 --> 35:09.000]  is made up of we the people and our country has been taken over by foreign foreign corrupt
[35:09.000 --> 35:19.000]  interest and so I believe in info war and we are seeing a massive info war take place
[35:19.000 --> 35:27.000]  right now by the people all over the world where they have these invasive checkpoints
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  that have been put in place but but focused here in the US saying no the pilots saying
[35:33.000 --> 35:49.000]  you let me fly the airplane you let me control the aircraft but I have to go through all
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.000]  these checkpoints the general public saying why don't you just profile people that you
[35:56.000 --> 36:12.000]  think are supposedly terrorists no people see through this in a big big way people understand
[36:12.000 --> 36:17.000]  this is a basic fraud and they're beginning to learn that the TSA has already expanded
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  with viper teams to checkpoints on highways bus stations train stations now they want them
[36:22.000 --> 36:31.000]  in malls in community areas this is a federal power grab and the population is saying no
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.000]  and the polls and Reuters 96% it was 97 it's still running 96% say they won't fly because
[36:39.000 --> 36:46.000]  of this every other poll at 60 70 80% CBS news polls you name it of people saying they're
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  against this and the government says we don't care we're doing it because we want to protect
[36:50.000 --> 36:56.000]  you this is a government for of and by the people if we don't want it that's the way
[36:56.000 --> 37:04.000]  it is you got a better chance being struck by lightning then being killed by a terrorist
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  I mean they're gonna put checkpoints at every street corner to stop muggings this is about
[37:09.000 --> 37:17.000]  a federal power grab now we have on the line John tiner who's now being persecuted in fact
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  here's the headline TSA to investigate body scan resistor but I've watched all the video
[37:23.000 --> 37:31.000]  that he recorded on his smartphone and they told him to leave he went and got his ticket
[37:31.000 --> 37:37.000]  refunded and then somebody runs up in a suit and says we're gonna get you civilly for 10,000
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  now they have a press conference the head of the TSA in San Diego last night and says
[37:41.000 --> 37:48.000]  it's 11,000 and we're going after him this is a guy they told to leave he leaves and
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.000]  then they come set him up this is bullying tyrants only exposing their true nature John
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  good to have you on with us well thanks for having me how are you doing well I'm doing
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  great because we're seeing a huge awakening take place out of the gates what do you think
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  of this huge revolt taking place this is the biggest story in the country this issue with
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  the TSA it's certainly not what I expected certainly not what I intended when I had an
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  encounter with them but I think it's great personally let's talk about your case specifically
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  because the audio is good but obviously the cameras laying there you know on the little
[38:27.000 --> 38:34.000]  gray boxes where they're searching you now they're coming after you it's clear from the
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.000]  tape that they told you go ahead and go then how can they come back then and say that you
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  basically escaped from the checkpoint area well that's an excellent question I mean I
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  was told by you know two TSA supervisors and Harbor police that I could either be padded
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  down or be escorted out of the area and you can see them all allowing me to leave and
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  having an officer escort me out of the area once you know they determined that it was
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.000]  time for me to go and then what happened next well I went over to the American Airlines
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  counter and asked them to refund my ticket and they happily did it you know despite it
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  being a non-refundable ticket they happily refunded it after about five minutes over
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  there I began to try and leave the airport when I was approached by another TSA representative
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  who I hadn't seen before and he was accompanied by the supervisor who had directed the agents
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.000]  to escort me out and also the Harbor police officer who had escorted me out and this new
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  this new gentleman told me that I needed to return to the screening area and finish being
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.000]  screened because it's against federal law to begin the screening process but to not finish
[39:36.000 --> 39:43.000]  it well that's amazing because the standard procedure is if you refuse the screening
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.000]  they tell you to leave the airport that's what happened with the lady in Florida that
[39:49.000 --> 39:56.000]  got so much attention Meg McLean they could get in trouble here for false charges or false
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.000]  civil claims I know that there's civil and criminal penalties for that in the US code
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.000]  I mean the TSA has had to have watched your video they know you have the evidence that
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  they told you to leave the airport if you weren't going to submit so what does this
[40:15.000 --> 40:21.000]  say about their arrogance sir if they're openly and publicly framing you
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  I honestly couldn't tell you I don't know what and they're trying to achieve by trying
[40:26.000 --> 40:33.000]  to intimidate me with you know a fine well John do you agree with my statement that this
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  appears to be a frame up I mean they know that they told you to leave the airport they
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  know that they said that you know either put up with this or leave and so they escorted
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  you out you went to get your ticket you weren't running through the concourse like you were
[40:46.000 --> 40:53.000]  escaping and then now they're claiming that you violated some type of civil act and they
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  want $11,000 and they're demonizing your name publicly I mean is this not a witch hunt
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  I'm not sure that I would characterize it as a frame up or a witch hunt I think probably
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  what happened is they violated their own policies and now they've got to try and make me responsible
[41:07.000 --> 41:17.000]  for it violated their own policies so now you notice this isn't law that's why they're
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  threatening you with something civil yeah I'm not a lawyer I'm not familiar with all the
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  ins and outs of what's civil and what's criminal and exactly what it is what law it is that
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  I broke so but but but they're claiming it's the law they have to fondle your genitals
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  without essentially it sounds like the argument because essentially if you follow their logic
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  they ask me to leave what I should have done you know was refused and stay and say you know
[41:41.000 --> 41:49.000]  what hey I need to be followed before I can leave here but to be clear because I've watched
[41:49.000 --> 41:55.000]  the tape many times they they say either do this or we're going to escort you out right
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.000]  yes and that's always been the procedure I guess they're now saying that they're going
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  to charge people civilly with an $11,000 fine if you don't put up with whatever searches
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  they deem necessary and if that means chest x-rays if that means cavity searches then
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.000]  so be it it does appear that way well where does this end I mean if Al Qaeda puts a
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  hand grenade up their rear end I mean are we all going to have to watch our three and
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  four-year-olds have TSA workers do proctology exams I don't think that that's an unfair
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  assessment based on the characterization I mean Richard Reed tried to blow up his shoes
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  and now we all take our shoes off this guy last Christmas tried to stuff a bomb down his
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  pants now we also submit to strip searches so I assume as soon as somebody tries to cram
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.000]  something into some orifice we're all going to get cavity searches well I've been here
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  asking a lot of the questions John Tyner for those that just joined us he's the gentleman
[42:46.000 --> 42:52.000]  who recorded what the TSA basically put him through and to add insult to injury now they're
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.000]  investigating whether they're going to charge you civilly for $11,000 are you planning on
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  fighting that if they try to bring you into civil court if they yes if they try and do
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  that then yeah I will fight it I've been contacted by the Rutherford Institute and the ACLU and
[43:07.000 --> 43:13.000]  a number of local attorneys who are all ready and willing to accept my case probably at
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  least I own a pro bono at least some of them have offered to do it pro bono so you heard
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.000]  it here first John Tyner will fight TSA persecution if they come after me I'm not I don't intend
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.000]  to sue them first you know I'm I think that you know getting my story out is is all that
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  you know like I said I I made the recording to protect myself just in case there was some
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  kind of interaction with them I didn't intend for the story to blow up the way it did I
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  don't really intend to sue them I don't really intend to carry this any further I think the
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  fact that the news is getting out and that people are seeing that they can stand up to
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  this is good enough for me sure but you're saying you will defend yourself you're not
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  just planning on paying the 11,000 that's true I think it's absolutely ridiculous that
[43:55.000 --> 44:00.000]  they can direct me out of the airport and then they find me $11,000 for following what
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.000]  they asked me to do unbelievable John I've been asking a lot of questions what else do
[44:05.000 --> 44:12.000]  you think is important for the listeners to hear oh boy yeah that's kind of an open
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.000]  into question I wasn't really prepared for well I mean we've covered a lot of facets
[44:16.000 --> 44:23.000]  of this and the country is in revolt this is one of those sagebrush type rebellions
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.000]  that's really caught the public's imagination everybody has been humiliated by this or had
[44:28.000 --> 44:33.000]  family has been humiliated or witness small children having their growing grabbed it's
[44:33.000 --> 44:40.000]  very upsetting and so this story is probably the biggest story going on right now
[44:40.000 --> 44:47.000]  worldwide just the overall intrusion of this federal bureaucracy yeah I absolutely agree
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.000]  with that you know I wish more people had the opportunity to stand up you know for what
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  they think is right but you know when you get to the airport and you know you've got
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.000]  you know hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in a trip a lot of people just think
[45:00.000 --> 45:06.000]  hey you know I'll put up with this because I can't afford not to why didn't they just
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.000]  drop this that would have been the smart thing you put the video out you exposed them it
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  only makes them look that much more bullying and thuggish to come back and have press
[45:16.000 --> 45:22.000]  conferences about you and and I thought this was about terrorists not about you know somebody
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  trying to go pheasant hunting yeah that that's an excellent question I mean deal the only
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  thing I can think is you know the video makes them look bad and they had to get out and
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.000]  you know answer it I I couldn't really tell you why they decided to come out and do anything
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  or you know pursue the issue but they couldn't argue with what they said and did on the
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.000]  tape so they then imply that you did something illegal or unlawful I think I think they don't
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  want to be the bad guy in this incident and the only person left to make the bad guy is
[45:49.000 --> 45:55.000]  me the only person left to be the bad guy is you absolutely disgusting I wanted the ACL
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  you say to you about your case they just sent me an email and said you know here's our contact
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  information if you need to contact us we're here John are you gonna be flying anytime soon
[46:07.000 --> 46:12.000]  I have no plans to fly until these machines and or the pat down you know until both go
[46:12.000 --> 46:18.000]  away I've seen statistics from CNN of over nine billion a year lost in just the last few
[46:18.000 --> 46:24.000]  years with the invasive searches and as this intensifies I mean again we saw the Reuters
[46:24.000 --> 46:34.000]  poll 96% now out of over 70,000 respondents 96% say they're not going to be flying I mean
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.000]  this is devastating our economy John I agree I mean well and it's not really making us
[46:39.000 --> 46:49.000]  safer either have you heard a time frame on whether or not they're going to try to find
[46:49.000 --> 46:54.000]  you $11,000 no I don't know anything more than what you've read in the news I haven't been
[46:54.000 --> 47:01.000]  contacted by anyone from TSA well I tell you I really I think it's bad PR what they're
[47:01.000 --> 47:06.000]  doing what's your view on that I think that I think that's correct yeah I I don't see
[47:06.000 --> 47:14.000]  any upside for them where do you see this ending I mean none of us have a crystal
[47:14.000 --> 47:19.000]  ball but clearly the American people are finding their spine they're getting up on their hind legs
[47:19.000 --> 47:26.000]  they're saying no no no but big brother doesn't like to back off and I don't know if you're
[47:26.000 --> 47:33.000]  aware of this but we've got him coming on coming up in the next hour one of the host
[47:33.000 --> 47:41.000]  Phil and host with tech talk Owen JJ stone has talked on the syndicated program about
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.000]  and then we went and searched the term and actually found other newscast confirming this
[47:46.000 --> 47:53.000]  that the TSA is now putting their hands down people's pants were you aware of that no I
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  mean I've heard stories of them at least putting you know their fingers inside of waistband
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  but no I have not heard any stories about them actually putting their hands into people's
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.000]  pants yes now they're not just doing it in the waistband they're going deeper yeah I was
[48:06.000 --> 48:13.000]  right so where do you see all this ending I'm not really sure I mean in general people
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  tend to have short attention spans I mean I I had an interview cancel on me this morning
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.000]  because Prince William announced his engagement so I don't know I mean I certainly hope it
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.000]  ends up with you know possibly even the TSA being abolished but that seems unlikely given
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  you know people's attention span seem to be pretty short I tend to agree with you on most
[48:35.000 --> 48:44.000]  issues people don't have a long attention span but having minimum wage type folks waddling
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.000]  around in their little uniforms groping children putting us through radiation scanners that
[48:50.000 --> 48:58.000]  has a way of of making people continue their anger in fact I see it only only intensifying
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  this this disgust with the TSA was already there it was all it was always there but as
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.000]  more people speak up like yourself it's now creating a focal point yeah no that's absolutely
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  true and like I said I certainly hope that it grows and and becomes a bigger thing and
[49:13.000 --> 49:19.000]  people actually stand up for their right but I'm I would be lying if I said that I think
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.000]  that that's the most likely outcome of this John are you aware that TSA has announced
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  they and have already deployed Viper teams on the streets of major cities and that they
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  want to start the naked body scanners with mobile trucks they've even ordered the trucks
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.000]  and that they plan to take this type of invasive activity to the streets of America and
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  then England already has mobile trucks where they pull up outside bars and make patrons
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.000]  go through them I am not aware of either of those things now what's your view on that
[49:52.000 --> 50:01.000]  that seems pretty scary to me sounds like big brother doesn't it yeah exactly like big brother
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  well John we've got to go to break here but I but I want to hold you over for
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  other five minutes you'll be gone by the end of the hour I want to come back and go over

[50:22.000 --> 50:28.000]  out a bunch of things that are quite frankly lies and I wanted to mention some of those

[53:57.000 --> 54:13.000]  com off the grid news dot com John tiner is our guest we're talking during the break
[54:13.000 --> 54:18.000]  John in your own words repeat what you were saying to me during the break which part
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.000]  well you were you know saying if we put up with this will put up with anything
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  oh well yeah you said that yeah but yeah I agree I mean there's not much else if we're
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.000]  allowing if we're willing to let the government look at us make it there's probably not much
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.000]  less that we wouldn't be a little willing to allow them to do and that's why they want
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.000]  to force this through on us this act of domination I mean if we capitulate to this
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.000]  then the sky's the limit I think there's certainly an argument you made in that direction
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.000]  John we wrote an article at prison planet dot com called big sis caught lying to American
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  people a she says the machines are safe even though the federal government itself
[54:52.000 --> 54:57.000]  and John Hopkins she cites John Hopkins is saying it's safe meanwhile John Hopkins
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  head of the radiation department radiology department is in the French news agency in
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  AP saying it's very dangerous she lies and says they can't save the image we have
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  the owner's manual the machines they do save the images now they've leaked images
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  from the federal marshals where they were naked body scanning that's top story on
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  Drudge what's your view on the lies of big sis I think it's terrible I mean I don't
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  know how we're supposed to trust that they have our best interest at heart when
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  everything they say you know three or four months later turns out to not be true
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  well what about TSA three weeks ago announced the enhanced pat downs so they would touch
[55:35.000 --> 55:40.000]  the crotch and breast and then when there was heat they said a week later oh we
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  don't touch your crotch even though it's on the news them doing it I mean how dumb
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  do they think we are John well I think people can judge for themselves based on
[55:48.000 --> 55:56.000]  what they hear incredible well we're gonna find out if the anger continues I
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  only see an intensifying I think we're gonna win this thing yeah I certainly
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.000]  hope you're right what is your gut tell you John well I was telling you that
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  during the break at least right now I mean it's hard for me to tell how big the
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.000]  story is I haven't been able to watch any media for the past three days so I
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  kind of have to trust your word for you you know take your word for it if you
[56:16.000 --> 56:23.000]  say that the anger is intensifying it is it is intensifying and I mean here's
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  another lie she says the pat downs are private and discreet they do them out
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  in full view and they're not private or discreet I mean it's just a culture of
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  lies John well in in their defense at least they do what they don't they do
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  offer private room and they did offer me a private room and I declined it because
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  if they were gonna pat me if I was going to allow me to pat down I wanted
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.000]  everybody to see exactly what it is that they do well more than that I've
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  I've interviewed some sexual assault victims and others I've seen other
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.000]  interviews they say it's even scarier to have this done privately so that's why
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  they wanted to be done out in the open as well yeah I certainly understand that
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  well tell us about your blog how can folks check that out they can go to
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  johnny edge dot blogspot.com and they can see the original article that I wrote
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  alongside the videos and some follow-up stuff I wrote to clarify exactly what
[57:14.000 --> 57:19.000]  took place well if more people record the TSA and if more people confront them
[57:19.000 --> 57:24.000]  they're not going to get away with this finally what's your take on these big
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  lobbyists like Alphonse Damato the former senator and the former head of
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  Homeland Security Chertoff heading up the companies that make billions off of
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.000]  this I mean he puts in the orders to buy the machines and then the head of
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  Homeland Security goes to become the head of the company yeah there's
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  certainly there's certainly something shady about that whole thing you know
[57:43.000 --> 57:49.000]  it's it's certainly it certainly looks on to untoward even if it's not well I
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.000]  think it's a conflict of interest anyway slice it yeah I would agree with that
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.000]  well great having you on hopefully as this case unfolds especially if they
[57:59.000 --> 58:04.000]  keep persecuting you hopefully we'll be able to get you back on the show but
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.000]  overall let's hope that they back down and do the same thing but maybe it's
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  better for them to try to persecute you John because then it really shows their
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  true colors I've had people send that opinion to me you know they say hey no
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  offense but I really hope you get through because I'd love to see this go to court
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  and actually have some case law come out of it so we'll see what happens I mean

[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  every week or two TSA agent 45 rapes 14 year old girl what do you expect folks
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  I'm not saying they're all pedophiles or even 10% of them are but I've studied
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  criminology took a little bit of it in college but have read me a mainline
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  textbooks since I got out of college up to understand the enemy and you know
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  truancy officers police officers CPS that's where you find the highest
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  concentrations of pedophiles you also find the highest concentration in
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  school teachers yeah in priest in anybody who's got access to children it
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  doesn't mean that you know even 10% of people that want to work with children
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  are bad it just means that's where you're gonna find the pedophiles and so
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  here's another report on that that's from before it's news they've got the
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  local newscast there the Transportation Security Administration worker at
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  Logan International Airport is accused of assaulting a 14 year old girl
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  Sean Shanahan 45 of Winthrop is being held a 50,000 cash bail following his
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  arraignment in East Boston District Court he is charged with a statutory rape
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  enforcement of a child and a decent assault and battery on a 14 year old
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  child we've got another big report Watson does now have his report out
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  you to get this out to drudge everybody else TSA now putting hands down
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  flyers pants big sis turns up the heat new enhanced pat downs more
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  intrusive I would say new enhanced enhanced this is now phase 3 new
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  super enhanced just get Watson on the horn and change that new enhanced
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  enhanced people understand it's a new one TSA invasive new screening
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  measures include officers literally putting their hands down people's pants
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  so we got a guest coming on about that good job on Watson getting that out so
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  quickly but but I'm got an article coming out tomorrow dealing with the
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  fact of is this the start of the second American Revolution and I was starting
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  to get into that before we had John Tyner on you see in the movie V for
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Vendetta and that's based on historical composites of things that have
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  happened when the little girls dressed up like Guy Fox in the cop shooter in
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  the back and adult men see it they just go that's it that's it and look it's
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  just once you don't care once a society doesn't care and gets out of their
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  cowed state we can sweep anything aside and the truth is most the military
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  and the police are good people they know what's going on is wrong see the
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  deeper the denial the more angry you're going to be when you wake up from it
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  kind of like I said two years ago with Obama I said the bigger they are the
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  harder they fall the bigger the messianic hype he's God he's going to save
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  us the harder he's going to fall six months into his administration lowest
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  approval rating ever for a president six months in he's now almost two years
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  in record low level the guy is dirt Washington Post yesterday what we
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  told you two months ago we know what we're talking about we some people know
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  football or some people know gardening we know this stuff but this is what we
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  do I told you he's probably not going to run again now high-powered Democratic
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  party people in the Washington Post say don't run again Mac don't run again
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Mac it's the same thing with this TSA I smell blood I smell weakness it's kind
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  of like Brock Lesnar two weeks ago when he finally got hit in the jaw and got
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  dizzy that guy smelled blood and took him down it's the same thing I smell it I
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  smell it New World Order blood they're right back hi folks this is Alex Jones
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with yourself
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano particles
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  I have tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call

[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  okay I want to open the phones up in this segment in the next segment and then
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  into the third hour today now the top drugs report headline is TSA now putting
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  hands down flyers pants so that went live at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com

[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  link I mean that is amazing TSA now putting hands down flyers pants Paul
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Joseph Watson and Alex Jones Drudge report.com I've only had the top
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  superlink one time I mean we've had the top of drugs as little links many times
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  we now have the super mega link and again if I had the super mega link and I'd
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  written about Prince Henry or Prince Twitley or whatever his name is what's
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  the name of that that Sax Coburg goth creature what's the name of that
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Prince Ling I don't know it's the big news today all over the place one of
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  Prince Charles is rat-like children is getting married okay Prince William
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  okay thank you see I don't know about this stuff if I would have had an article
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  linked on Drudge report the biggest website in the world about Prince
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Henry I wouldn't care or Prince William or whatever his name is but I do care
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  about this because it's important I want to be able to fly I want to take my
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  children to the Smithsonian they would have already been there I want to take
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  my children to Disneyland once they beg to go all the time I want to be able to
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  take my children to the Florida Keys to go snorkeling like I did as a child I
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  want to be able to take my children to Colorado but if I want to do that I've
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  got to drive and so I've got to add basically two weeks on to a vacation
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  that would be a week long and I can't take off two three weeks I rarely maybe
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  once a year take off a full week and then I'll generally just stay at home
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  and spend time with my children and play board games and you know you know take
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  them to movies or go hiking or go out to eat dinner and we got a fire pit in the
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  backyard we'll sit out there and roast marshmallows or hot dogs or whatever
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  the case may be I want to be able to take my children flying but you are not
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  going to put your hands on my daughters or my son I can't physically handle it
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  you understand that and again I don't claim to be Mr. Tough Guy but there's
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  certain things I can't handle I've got a very long fuse unless it comes to my
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  children and I think most of us are like that but you do something to my
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  children I mean I see these newscasts where children are crying and the men
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  and women are grabbing between their legs and grabbing their rear end and grabbing
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  their chest and these little girls and boys are crying and the parents are
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  sitting there yelling at them saying put up with it I mean these parents have
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  lost all of their basic instincts to defend their family if you want to
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  comment on the economic news the TSA situation any of it you're welcome to
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  I'd love to hear from you 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 I may have finally got
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  rid of my cold if I sound a bit dingy on air or a bit more toad-like than normal
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  but I finally got a fever last night and the bed was soaked with sweat this
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  morning and my fever broke about 6 a.m. and I say I finally got a fever I've had
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  this chest cold for two weeks with no fever and haven't been able to get rid of
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  it and I rarely get sick and finally I got really sick last night I was glad
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  I was shivering I wrapped myself in blankets I had a fever I'm like oh
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  thank God I've got a fever maybe I'll start getting better now and I feel a
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  lot better today because that's what a fever does it raises your temperature to
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  kill whatever it is growing in my lungs and it seems like half of Austin's got
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  it and I'm sorry to I'm sorry to get off into this because I got a lot of news
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  and things to cover it's just that my wife yesterday hold on a minute my wife
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  yesterday and today begged me to stay home and get better but how do I stay
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  home and get better when all of this is happening how do I stay home and not be
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  on air in what could be the start of the second American Revolution
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  tyrannies get overthrown when cops shoot a kid there have been real cases of that
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  all over the world in the last hundred years not just in V for vendetta when
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  they shoot the little girl and everybody overthrows the government but I've been
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  looking for a peaceful way as Mahatma Gandhi talked about and Martin Luther
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  King talked about to say no to this federal encroachment no to these big
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  private central banks raping us and by the people having an effect and by
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Napolitano now coming out and saying okay we won't we won't search 12 and unders that
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  was this morning and she also announced okay the pilots just have to have their
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  ID checked to make sure that they are who they say they are that makes perfect
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  sense you're about to fly a plane with 300 people on it or 200 people on it it
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  uses a weapon totally reasonable to check your ID make sure you who you say you are
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  it's the same thing for citizens if you don't have a criminal record and
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  especially if you've flown a lot in the past you shouldn't have to go through
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  any screening and and and this is going with the official story that the
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  terrorism is real I mean if the terror is real why aren't Arabs and Muslims the
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  only people being profiled see it's a fraud why are our borders wide open if
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  we're supposedly under this terrorist attack but oh at the airports alone we've
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  got to have all this security so a lot of really exciting things happening this
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  came out about 20 minutes ago ethics committee finds wrangled guilty that's
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  seeing in a house ethics committee found representative Charlie wrangled

[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  the beginning of the end for Charlie wrangled but our story TSA now putting

[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  present planet version has that sub headline that describes it better big
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  sis turns up the heat new enhanced pat downs more intrusive but it doesn't
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  matter the information is now is now getting out there and that's what
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  matters and they're beginning to cave in on all of this that's what's important
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  as well okay let's go to your phone calls let's go ahead and talk to Julio
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  in Illinois Julio thanks for holding welcome Alex man this is huge I've got
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  my roommate all fired up about the the molesters at TSA I'm proud of John
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  everyone who's taking a stand to get the against us I'm never gonna fly until
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  these machines are gone I'm planning on taking the train but then again who knows
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  maybe the polytano will bring the full body scanners no no they're already
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  announcing pat they've already done pat downs and searches randomly at trains
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  for at least five years that's that's expanding right now quickly Alex this
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  is huge last year we defeated Copenhagen new pop champagne on your show I'm not
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  sure if you know this or if this wasn't on your mind but I believe in two weeks
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  time in Cancun, Mexico the scum of the United Nations will cave in on the
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  Mexican police state and will start up their world government talks with the
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Cancun agreement to try to clamp down on world government I don't know if you
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  could bring out Lord Christopher Montanon to give us an update on what's
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  gonna go on in Cancun of course the Mockingbird media will get this Alex
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  NBC is doing green is universal which is interesting the media is setting this up
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  two weeks in advance and they're doing their propaganda pieces on global warming
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  and climate change setting up for the the Cancun meetings yes we've been
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  covering that in the last few months but I do need to get Christopher Montan
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  back on he's the real expert and I believe he may even be traveling down to
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  Cancun where these scallywags are going to be meeting Julio great points good
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  to hear from you appreciate the call let's talk to Tim in Ohio Tim you're on
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  the air TSA tyranny starts at the airports my question to you Alex today
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  where are the county sheriffs and why aren't they involving themselves as the
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  highest elected public servant in the counties where these airports are located
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  well what's happened is the feds came in with their mission Crete and they signed
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  agreement civilly with the airports and and with the airlines to get people to
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  just civilly consent to this fraud but because local tax money in every case
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  is paying for the airports there is local city and county jurisdiction and
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  that would then revert to the sheriff and that's a great point and I actually in
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  Texas have heard the state police on the news and legislators and legislators
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  also in New Jersey and now federally that's in the news the Republicans I
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  talked to Ron Paul's office yesterday we're trying to get him on next week
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  he's going to introduce a bill to just get rid of all of this so the battle is
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  on the heat is on now you better believe that the globalists are going to mail
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  a few more bombs and try to scare us into submission and we need to say look
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  the borders are wide open 28,000 dead on the US Mexico border that's the real
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  crisis you know we'd rather face the danger as Americans have said in polls
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  then be patted down by the real danger government tyranny good points Tim Brad

[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  ear hello yes sir hey Alex how are you doing I'm doing alright I hate to
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  straight away from the TSA very big news and I'm glad to hear everybody's not
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  you know licking boots on this my question Alex is really is not one
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  of your opinion me and a couple friends were debating the whole 9-11 and this
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  new uncovered footage you covered yesterday and a lot of this and I was
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  wondering is it possible that the plane brought down in Pennsylvania by the
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  citizens on that plane on the crash I believe it was in Pennsylvania they
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  claim was for the White House is that possible that plane was really meant for
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  tower seven you know three buildings three sets of explosives three planes
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  well if you look at the trajectory the plane was going in the direction at the
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  time it was shot down or brought down in the general direction it could have gone
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  to New York or it could have gone to Virginia it was going in that general
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  direction so we don't know and we all like to believe that fellow citizens took
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  over the plane believe me I mean I'm not a tough guy but if a bunch of guys are
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  running around they hijacked the plane I'm gonna I'm gonna go after them and
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  and most Americans are gonna go after them but state police and other
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  witnesses at the time said they saw F-16s and an explosion and the debris field
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  on that jet was eight miles and the crater at Shanksville wasn't even an engine
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  I mean I mean it was a little bitty crater that was not where the whole plane
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  crashed and that would be indicative of a missile multiple missiles breaking the
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  plane up in you know up in the atmosphere and then it raining down and
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  Bush now said in his new memoir his new book that sound decision point I think
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  is the name of it but I've read the read the quotes from his book online that he
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  thought a missile had shot it down because he'd ordered it shot down so we
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  know from Pentagon sources it was Colonel Don de Grand Prix he died shortly
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  after and then later I confirmed most of this that it was the happy hooligans
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  out of the Dakotas who were on drill in Virginia that day and that they fired
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  out of F-16 to aim nines or sidewinders into that aircraft and so we don't know
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  the truth but we know the official stories a lie though anything else yeah
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  I mean it turns down it's it's evident even with all the YouTube footage alone
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  what really makes me sick is there's men in prison doing life for murder with less
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  evidence than what we have on 9-11 right now and that to me is just sitting I
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  seen Bush on Oprah promoting his new book and it just made me want to puke he is
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  just the most tyrannical evil individual I've ever seen and I got yeah I just
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  think we really need to push for the 9-11 definitely congratulations so we're
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  building what that word keep pushing but I mean yeah we are we are pushing
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Brad God bless you Jonas in Illinois you're on the air hey Alex how you doing
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  good go ahead good yeah hey first I wanted to say I think you're doing a
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  really good job and you know I'm a veteran I have a degree in finance and
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  I'm in my last year of law school now and and your message is really starting to
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  get out there with this TSA incident thing you know I agree with you I think
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  the sleeping giant is starting to wake up and and I'm almost wondering if that's
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  what the government wants you know you talk about these FEMA camps it is this
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  just a pretext or what the pretext to actually fill those FEMA camps up well
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  look there's a lot of different pretext there could be a biological attack
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  there could be a giant terror attack there could be a political uprising that's
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  violent there could be a big war there are a lot of different they always prime
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  the camps whether it's Russia or Germany or China with a politically
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  unpopular group so they always put Jews in them first or communists or religious
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  minorities I've seen the former head of the CIA Woolsey and others propose
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  putting all Muslims in camps or putting all the illegal immigrants in camps but
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  they admit in Rex 84 that once the precedent is set with the unpopular
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  group in the camp now that secret police network is set up now due process
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  is shelled and once all of that is shelled then they start going after everybody
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  because the tyrants want to consolidate power they want to take over industries
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  they want to go after everybody but they always set the precedent first on an
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  unpopular minority and that's what's going on here and that hey mm-hmm go ahead
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  also one other thing hey you know I hear you plug in Georgia report a lot and
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  now I've got a news aggregation website myself it's daily-off dot com daily the

[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  but this story of course deals with oh and JJ stone known as the oh doctor he's the founder of men's medium and oh doctor dot com he's a speaker and commentator in the areas of social media technology and politics and I came in this morning and saw a video clip of him on
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  this week in tech with Leo Laporte and I said okay write an article about that that is important because I'd already seen some other newscast and we did a search and found more with people reporting it's like enhanced enhanced it's like super enhanced
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  if you're supposedly wearing baggy clothes now they don't just stick their finger in they stick their whole hand in and go around your hind end then they come up and grab your crotch but from outside and he told the story on this week in tech of what happened to him
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  and we've got him live with us here in just a moment but I wanted to play that video clip again right now before we go to him of his testimony they'll have him break it down in more detail here on this syndicated broadcast but here is oh and JJ stone talking about what happened to him
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  I'm not I'm not because I am fundamentally opposed to the to the x-ray machines and in fact I don't know they had recently or is it coming up with Wednesday November 24 2010 is national opt out day now most people don't know on the x-ray machines you can always opt out
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  all you have to say is I opt out and then they give you a pat down search was and if we all did it I do that air traffic regardless stop well listen maybe I know when I just flew here this weekend I wore the same sweatpants I wore last week good L.A.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  this year this weekend when I came in he's like oh they just changed the rules this week do you want a private screening or do you want to patch it out here and I'm like what do you mean he's like
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  well do you want us to take you in the back room or do you want to do it out here what does it entail I have to go in your waistband put my hand down your pants I'm like do it out here and I stood in front of everybody and he did it
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  wait what's the alternative can I go through a machine no alternative is for him to go in the back room and pat I had he's going to put his hands down your pants no matter what he did yes and I said I'd rather have him do it out here in public because just what Brian said
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  he's he's already ashamed to do it and I feel like he's not going to go when did this happen this weekend they're required to put their hands down your just change the rule well I put his hands on his hands
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  wait a minute I'm not necessarily put this is the this is the new TSA is that you have to get if you're wearing sweatpants or baggy clothing oh baggy clothes I was wearing sweatpants they're not baggy they're sweatpants he put his hand this is my waistband because I gotta tell you if I have to get my somebody
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  my pants I'm not playing around the ring of my waistband and then pat the front and then pat my butt and then in my crotch and you know it's all security theater it does absolutely nothing that's the part that kills me is that is that for all of the federalization for all this
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  okay bureaucracy for the five dollars let's go to Owen JJ stone Owen good to have you on with us thanks for having me nice to meet you a nice talk to you nice to meet you so break down your story it is the top story now upon the drudge report TSA now putting hands down flyers pants and we took a short clip of you talking about it
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  and then added a clip from another newscast admitting it just in case people were in denial because three weeks ago TSA announced they would touch genitals and breast and then when there was backlash TSA said we're not touching genitals and it's just this
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  this culture of lying but give us your take overall on what the TSA is doing and then tell us what happened to you
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  well first of all in general I fly maybe 20 to 30 times a year so I'm a frequent flyer I do not carry any liquids I don't even carry deodorant I check all that stuff I go to a local market and buy like the trial slides I never should buy with anything at all and I don't go through
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  with any metal no watches no phone nothing so when I go through I never beat I haven't beat in years so you know I fly I don't want to get beat so I flew 10 days ago in the LA wearing the same clothes I was wearing the same sweatpants now I went through
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  and didn't beat but he said oh your sweatpants little baggy we're going to patch you down they did the regular tap tap barely touch you go ahead this weekend I fly to San Francisco wearing the exact same outfit because I travel a lot so I wear the same kind of clothes so if I didn't have a problem then I shouldn't have a problem now
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  and a guy comes up they made me wait there for 10 minutes in the little box which usually doesn't happen yet they come in real quick he says oh we're going to take you on our private room and I said for what is it go we're going to have to patch you down I'm like well they always pat me down just pat me down right here
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  he's like oh I'm going to have to go inside your pants I'm like what he's like I have to it's a new rule we have it's a different kind of search so I'm like well what are my options you know and he said well I can patch you down out here
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  or I can do it in a private room he's like you probably prefer a private room and I looked at him like there's no way I'm going anywhere
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  all my stuff's here you know I travel electro equipment I'm not packing up all my stuff at all I'll do it right here I'm not going anywhere
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  so he got down on his knees and he started pat me down the regular way then he said okay now I'm going to stick my hand down your pants
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  and literally to his wrist his hand went in my waistband around my crotch around my butt twice then he went on the outside pat down on front and back
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  and then he put his hand back down in front of my pants like grabbing my crotch like the feel in between my legs
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  excuse me the hand was inside on your crotch
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  yeah I had not inside my underwear but inside my pants
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  oh my god
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  I'm a fairly big guy I'm overweight and I'm like six foot tall and he was like five four maybe and he had like the fear because I was as hot
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  I'm so sorry I'm so sorry and I'm just thinking what would happen if you took me in a room you know because he was already embarrassed to do it
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  apparently you know they just changed the rules so he hasn't had weeks of time doing this or practicing or you know have his mind set on hey this is what I do
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  so he was embarrassed to do it and apologetic to do it but at the same time I'm like wow
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  I'm going to have to start wearing like speedos or something through the airport so they know that I'm not carrying anything
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  I don't know I don't know how women are going to put up with it I have no clue
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  well you teach your children don't let strangers touch you and now three weeks ago I was at an airport in California
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  and I watched nothing but women and children put through for some reason in the four scanners then they would call them out and touch between their legs
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  touch their breast I saw this being done to babies and baby carriages
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  my daughter's
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  I'm sorry go ahead
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  my daughter's three years old and I will not take her flying anywhere until she's at least four or five so if anything happens like that
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  she can explain to me what's going on or you know how she's feeling because I see that kind of stuff happen with kids
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  and people are like bring your daughter and I'm like I don't take my daughter anywhere that I can't drive because I'm not going to have someone else
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  putting their hands on my child like I don't even know like I heard the clip earlier and it had raised my heart
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  I don't know how someone could sit there and let their child scream and be violated by a stranger
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  who knows what that's going to do to that child it won't happen to my child I can't I can't imagine
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  but if they can get away with this Owen they can get away with anything I mean clearly this is being done to train us and condition us
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  to have the government in our business the government putting their hands on our bodies
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  are you aware of the fact that TSA for at least five six years but now they're expanding it has Viper teams is what they call them
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  and in mobile vans and mobile body scanners not just in federal and state courthouses and that they're openly announcing
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  they want to put them in malls and just everywhere you go they'll be federal goons outside their jurisdiction
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  randomly searching us then meanwhile the southern borders wide open
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  I heard about that and I firmly believe it now because I think that this pat down is invasive pat down is just a step to scare people
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  so the normal pat down didn't make people think oh I'll go through these x-ray machines to get radiation that I don't know anything about
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  I mean when I go to the doctor to get it people put metal plates on my chest to protect me from radiation
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  so you want me to go stand in a machine and x-rays me naked and keeps a copy of it
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  oh but the people will fight that so what do we do we grab their breasts we grab the genitals and everyone will say oh I'd rather have the machine
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  they can make millions of dollars off these machines it's a scare tactic to get people to use those machines instead of being violated personally
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  and you're still being violated because I don't trust people I don't trust you Alex I just met you five minutes ago
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  I'm not going to give you access to something of mine just to know say oh you're going to take care of that who can trust anybody
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  so you trust that they're going to delete your picture of your breasts your genitals you know no matter who you are
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  well by the way it's now come out on gizmodo today through a four year request that the 35,000 images at one federal courthouse in Florida
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  they released hundreds of them and it shows that they were saving them they were making jokes about it
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  they've been caught in England saving them as well so they have now been caught red-handed doing this and they also have all of these
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  major scientific bodies including groups in the federal government saying that there is a danger of radiation in these scanners
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  and then Napolitano Janet Napolitano comes out and says a this is not invasive the pat downs when it clearly is
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  b there's no danger from the radiation c we're not saving the images and the machines can't save the images
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  when we have the owner's manual I wrote about this a year and a half ago at prisonplanet.com where they admit they save the images
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  I mean this is insane and now they've announced they want to start saving the scan to use it as biometrics to identify
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  just like they can scan your retina or your face or your thumb to scan your whole body that's a market watch
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  I'll never go through another machine and when if they ever want to pat me down I'll have them do it in public
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  because again when other people see what's going on and if somebody gets a little too frisky then they're obligated to calm down
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  because people are in the view if you wanted to take me in a back room why would they even give me that option
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  if you're not doing anything wrong why not do it out here why say do you want to go in a private room
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  why do I need to go in a private room we've got to make love we've got cigarettes and candles back there
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  there's no reason for you to do that and again it's a scare tactic because once you go in that room
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  I'm going to tie in a little box and I start feeling nervous about what's going on when I got two or three men looking at me
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  while another guy's touching it's a scare tactic to sell these machines and then Lord knows that like you said
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  without information where they're going to do it the machine and radiation I don't I can't believe that somebody would say
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  oh there's no radiation how long are the machines been out oh did they do a 20-year study do they know I don't think so
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  well let's just tell me well let's expand on that you and I and many others you know months ago I'd said on air
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  clearly they're going to enhance pat downs to intimidate you to make you use the machines then the TSA admittedly told Atlantic
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  monthly and other major publications in the last two weeks that oh we're not worried about the enhanced pat downs
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  because nobody's going to go for them this is meant to make you go through the machine so they admit this has nothing to do with terrorism
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  just what you said they're trying to intimidate you to go through the machines and then it turns out all funds to motto the
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  former senator a lobbyist and Chert off the former head of Homeland Security Chert off two and a half years ago made the first order
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  for several billion dollars of the machines then he leaves office and goes and becomes the CEO of the company and he consults for the other
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  company I mean that's illegal he makes the order for the machines then he goes and gets the job as the head of the company is that
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  not a payoff it has to be it has to be the funny thing that kills me about whatever someone brings up terrorism at airport
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  I say no one in the government cares about terrorism at airport okay I fly all the time LAX one of the biggest airports in the world
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  you know what stops you from running on to the tarmac and throwing up a grenade or a bomb or an automatic weapon and shooting out
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  a plane when it goes to land or takes off a chain link fence and they've got you know 30 cop cars and squad cars checking underneath your
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  car for bombs because yeah a terrorist is going to put a bomb underneath his car and drive into the airport because
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  no this is police state training exactly they don't want to stop anything if they wanted to stop if they had protection all around
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  the airport there's no protection well Owen it came out last week on ABC news that illegal aliens can walk right in and rent
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  aircraft for training and the TSA gives them waivers and no security background check anybody who had a truck bomb could just
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  drive into the cargo area with no checkpoints and drive right up to the fence and blow it up absolutely they are training the
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  public when you pull up in front of the airport and when you go into the airport to be a slave to be searched to be checked to
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  have your genitals groped to have your hind in grabbed to have your wife's breast grabbed to have your children grabbed for
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  police state America that's all this is is is is dog training well somebody's gonna have to get a lot of electronic leash on
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  because that's what they want to do I mean again if it was all about terrorism there's so many things that this country could do
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  besides fighting wars in other countries to build up our own defenses here at home I don't care about the rest of the world
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  I care about home and apparently you don't have enough guards on duty to protect at home that tells me that you don't care about
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  terrorists you know it's just like the war on drugs you say something everybody claps and then they put their head down and
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  forget about it well this airplane stuff that there's gonna be women that have been sexually molested had been violated in their lives that are
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  gonna freak out if a man of another woman or someone tries to put their hands on them because it's very invasive like again I'm
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  scenario is a grown man thinking well what happens if I get excited this guy's grabbed off all my stuff what am I supposed to do
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  I mean who's job is it that they think that they could just do that and it'd be okay I mean from a week ago they train you in a week
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  and say okay now you're gonna start lifting up genitals and grabbing butts and putting your hands in people's pants 30 40
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  hundred two thousand times a deck and who says okay to that what kind of person are you that that's what you want to do you
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  want to touch children you want to touch old women or men I mean or look at naked pictures of people that you have no idea who
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  they are all day well that was my next question that was my next question is who wants this job I mean you said this guy
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  kept apologizing to you because he knows it's wrong even a big brother says it's right to have his hand down in your pants on
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  your underwear on the front of your underwear I mean describe that what what did he do to your junk.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  His hand was flat and basically like the person who did the ring around where he just ran his hand around my waist and around my head so it's like if you put your hand inside you rubbed your thigh hand flat that's just what he did then when he went and put his hands in my butt put his hands in and then he patted it patted my butt like I don't like you or his wife
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  yeah like that kind of like hey baby how you doing there exactly um to to pass and then when he went back in the front he did the same thing like he patted in between my crotch right around right around my area.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  Let's be specific you're saying he patted on your underwear your testicles yeah unbelievable and I apologize to radio listeners we don't normally get into these type of things but we have to talk about it when the government
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  I don't even want to say it that's how embarrassing it is because even when I was on Leo's show you know I said I was like you know he was like he freaked out like he touched your part but I was like yes and I don't you who wants to even say it let alone have it done to you.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  What do you think about your story now being the top link on dredge report.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  Well at least people know about it so I'm happy about that because I was blown away I literally I almost freaked out because I told the guys three times I'm like I just flew five days ago.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  I'm wearing the exact same clothes I'm thinking what is the difference between then and now you know I wish I would have known I would have worn different clothes.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  I would dress more appropriately I had another flight to come home I wore a short and a t-shirt.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  It doesn't matter they're always adding more more more more more training us seeing what they can get away with.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  Hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.

[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  That's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest forcing taxes to serve us debt.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  Hi Ted Anderson I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system call for your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to understand the system call 800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  Normal blood pressure naturally how would that make you feel?
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  I'm Don from the Mexican January of 2000 I had a heart attack then my real health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure high blood sugar poor vision and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  My health was a mess pretty much.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  I started taking heart and body extract and within a few days I started sleeping a lot better.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  My blood pressure normalized my blood sugar normalized and my sleep really did improve.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  I experienced these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of heart and body extract order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 that's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  Folks I did not expect this at all about a 7th, 8th and 9th day I saw dramatic improvements from taking heart and body extract.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for heart and body extract.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  He's known as the ODocta.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  Briefly tell us a little bit about yourself Owen, Owen JJ Stone and your website, what you work on dealing with tech stuff and then let's get back into the points you were trying to finish up before we went to break.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  Long story short on the business then I run our InquireMinds Media and we do consulting and web design and strategy for the internet social campaign, the Facebook, the Twitter, promoting people as such.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  I also do ODocta.com where I do interviews, live Q&A sessions every Wednesday where I have guests on and people can ask them questions about the industry, their profession and that's pretty much it.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  So I'm all over the web and I'm in the tech space getting on fun shows and having a good time.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  That's why it's something like this again when he said earlier like who wants to talk about it?
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  I mean it's embarrassing but if you don't say it the people won't know about it.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  That's why I'm happy that it is on the DredgerPore right now and that people are talking about it.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  I got to say it on Leo's show and listeners are aware.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  I mean Leo's about to go fly to Paris.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  He took me a thought over there.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  Are you serious with my guest?
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  They do that stuff so it's nice that the awareness is getting around about it.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  I see this as a historical revolt though because there was already simmering anger over the TSA and the humiliation and the slave training.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  But now that they're trying to intensify it and more and more people are going public, the mainstream media is going for making fun of people that criticize it.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  To Time Magazine headline, everybody hates the TSA.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  The Chicago Tribune, government in your pants, Forbes magazine abolished the TSA.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  I mean this is a complete route of these people and Big Sis is like okay, we won't search the pilots.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  Okay, we won't search kids.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  But I guarantee you in a few months she's going to come back and try to put it back in place because bullies want to dominate.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  They want to set that precedent.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  I'm just waiting for all of these mainstream media pundits and people that get paid to say what they're supposed to say.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  The monkeys and the media to get searched.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  I want to anchor a man or anchor a woman to go through on one of their business trips and have someone put their hand down their pants or fill them up and see how they feel.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  And then see how comfortable they feel reading some crap from a teleprompter to the American public.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  Because until it happens to you, it's easy to say oh, it's not a big deal.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  It's about our security.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Well, if they want security, I think gun turns all around the airport.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  That would make me feel secure.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Not a dog and a van with a mirror looking underneath my car when I go to the airport.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  They don't care about your security.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  They care about these machines and making this money.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  And the airport, as soon as they get you accustomed to it, they are going to put them in schools.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  Oh, because so many kids shoot kids at school.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  And it happens and it's terrible and it's bad.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  But that's not a terroristic plague on my country.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  Look, they're teaching you that you are the enemy.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  That's what this is all about.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  Yeah, we're the problem, even though they can't protect us in our own country and state.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  But we're the problem.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  It's a power grab.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  It's a power grab simply put.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  What would you like to see happen with the TSA?
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  I would like something like more sophisticated besides the X-ray machine that showed my body part.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  Why don't they have something that really just doesn't matter if the detections can't?
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  I mean, if that kid that went through there, obviously, what do they have on them to set off the metal detector twice?
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  It's a child.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  Okay, they have a belt on.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  Why don't you make it more sophisticated metal detectors?
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  You know, I just don't understand why you need to see people naked look through their clothing
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  or violate them and touch them in places you're not supposed to touch them.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  And again, you should never, ever, ever be asked to take that screening in private.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  Because if you can't do it in public, then that means there's something wrong with it.
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  If you can't do that in front of the hundreds of other people standing behind me, then there's something wrong with that.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  And that's where the procedure needs to change to start with.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  There should never be a private screening.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  Because it shouldn't be anything that violates my well-being of the way I feel about myself.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  But that's not going to happen.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Very well said, Owen.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  Owen, we're going to break.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  You got anything else you want to add or is that it?
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  Thanks for having me on the show. I appreciate you and everybody.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  I tell you what, stay there. Stay there. I want you to finish up.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  They turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:01.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  We're going to continue with your phone calls, get into the economic news, the police state news.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  We're trying to pass legislation to basically ban family farms and ranches without all these special new fees and fines.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  That's coming up. That bill's very close to passing again.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  Senate bill, S-1050, Food Safety Modernization Act, vote imminent without law gardening and saving seeds.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  You can't make this stuff up. It's actually in the bill.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  You got kids having the police called on them for selling cupcakes.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  Little girls can't have a lemonade stand.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  All over the country, kids can't have American flags because the illegal aliens hate the country so much
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  that they demand the flags be taken down and the teachers agree the flags are removed.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  This country's a joke. And as citizens, we better get mad and get angry.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  We do need to add to Paul Joseph Watson's article that's on PrismPlanet.com, top-linked on Drudge.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  Drudge was crashing InfoWars, so we made it redirect to a PrismPlanet mirror of the same article.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  We have an ad server on InfoWars that's always causing problems. It doesn't do it on PrismPlanet, so we linked over there.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  But we need to update this and say that we've now interviewed Owen J.J. Stone, a.k.a. the O-Doctor,
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  because now, like he said on the show, he didn't want to get into detail, but it was worse that they actually padded.
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  They didn't just touch his rear end. They padded it. Like, hey, baby, you know, get on in there.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  And they put the hand in the front and gave a little pat.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  And he said the guy was apologizing. Well, obviously he's apologizing. He knows it's wrong.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Why does he have this job then, Owen?
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  I have no idea why he has that job. Again, in my mind, regular normal human beings don't have this job.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  And the one thing that you asked me earlier where I wanted to end with is that I'm actually happy that this happened
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  because most of the country and most of the world, anymore, is pacified by things.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  And one of the things you don't mess with is children and your personal privacy.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  And nothing gets more personal. People tap phones, all that kind of stuff. Everything goes on.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Nothing gets more personal than pictures of your naked body showing up somewhere.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Nothing gets more personal than another adult touching you in a way that you don't want them touched,
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  and especially when it happens to children.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  So go ahead and put these X-ray machines in. That's criminal schools.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  And that will finally set some people off to do something because this is outrageous and it's egregious.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  I mean, at the end of the day, who wants someone else looking at them when they don't give them permission to do it?
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  No one. No one wants it.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  And for it to happen in schools, who's looking at all these pictures, all these images, pedophiles?
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  You know, if I was a pedophile, why not find out for a job?
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  Well, I remember Pennsylvania and where the school was recording thousands of images of the laptops
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  while the kids were at home dressing and undressing and in their own beds.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  And the school thought it was so normal. They went public. They were the ones that told on themselves.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  Yep. And so what do people say?
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  Oh, well, you know, that doesn't happen when you tell somebody that story.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  It's the actual fact. And when it becomes well-known and spread, everyone will understand that it's wrong
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  and it's violating people's privacy.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  And my friend keeps messaging me because he's a long time listening to your show and he said,
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  can he get a well-dressed man to escort him around the TSA so that he can get in and out of his flight?
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  Because apparently, if you have a government official with you, you can get past anything, you know?
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  And who knows what somebody's doing? I wonder if they're going to pat down?
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  Yeah, your friend's bringing up Mutalib, the underwear bomber.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  We had several witnesses who were on the plane from Amsterdam.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  He didn't have his passport, didn't even have his ID, and a well-dressed man, obviously in command,
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  got him through the scanners without scanning, got him onto the airplane,
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  and then he was protected. And then it came out.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  The State Department was ordered by a, quote, unnamed U.S. agency to help get the underwear bomber on
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  the week before all the scanners arrived.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  They ordered them a year before that.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  And then right as they're about to arrive, a government stooge is protected onto the plane.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  Um, and, oh, I actually believe that that happened.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  One thing, just to corroborate some things that you bring up.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  Well, hold on. Hey, Owen, you're awesome, man. You need to do a regular talk show.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  I guess you do. Stay there. We're going to come back, have you finish up,
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  and I promise I'm getting to the calls and all the other news.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  Uh, he's the, oh, doctor, Owen J.J. Stone.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  We'll be right back. We'll tell you about his website and a lot more.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  He was co-hosting this week in tech.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  Uh, and the story's up on the Drudge Report about them grabbing his genitals.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  Stay with us.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  Number five, a solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  one of my old sponsors.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:05.000]  You've heard me talk about Calvin five-star soaps for years.
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  Check them out on the web at five-starsoap.com
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  or call 800-340-7091.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  Take my word for it.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  Since 1947, Calvin's soap company has been showing consumers
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support info wars.

[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years,
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  satisfaction is guaranteed on double your dirt back.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  for a free catalog or visit our website, five-starsoap.com.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  Thank you.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  and they really are calling the shots.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists,
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  who do we make the checkout to?
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  Well, we're updating the story that is the top link on the Drudge Report.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  Get ready.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  Now putting hands down flyers pants.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  That's what Drudge has. TSA now putting hands down flyers pants.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  And as bad as the clip was that we were talking about
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  on the syndicated radio slash TV show that Owen J.J. Stone was on,
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  he came on our show and said, well, I didn't want to go all the way with it,
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  but they actually put their hand in my pants and padded my rear end
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  and then put their hand down my pants and padded my testicles.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  But no one wants to talk about this,
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  but we have to talk about this abuse to stop it.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  But we were getting into the underwear bomber being led onto the plane,
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  protected by the U.S. government.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  The FBI said that witnesses were liars for two months.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  Then when the undersecretary of state got in trouble,
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  he came out and said, okay, I was ordered to do this, so don't blame me.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  U.S. government ordered us to help Mutalib get on the plane.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  It's the same thing every single time.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  And you were saying that you wanted to add something to that, Owen, go ahead.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  Last part of that, I don't want to take up too much time on your show.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  Whenever I talk to someone as skeptical about what the government can do
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  and why they would do things, I say, well, what about the Tuskegee Airmen?
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Did the government not do things to their own troops
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  and people that were putting their lives on the line for their own country?
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  Yes, they did.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  And they came out and they admitted it.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  Oh, it was wrong. We shouldn't do it.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  That just puts you in a mental state of what they can do.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Did this government come out and tell me is there weapons of mass destruction?
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  And then three or four years later they say, oh, there's no weapons of mass destruction,
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  but we still need to have the war anyway.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  I mean, there are basic lines of lies that they give you
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  that they apologize for later and that people that pass under the bridge.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  I mean, at the bottom line, don't trust anyone.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  Question everything because as soon as you start taking everything somebody feeds you,
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  you're going to end up getting sick because not everything is for everyone.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  And I appreciate you having me on the show and bringing up this topic.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  Well, Owen, Owen, it's funny you brought that up, but I didn't want to bring it up
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  just because there's so much to cover.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  But I was thinking the same thing 20 minutes ago.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  I was going to bring up the issue and not because you're black, but because it affects us all.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  For 45 years they shot black men up with syphilis to watch how it killed them
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  and to have them spread it in the black community.
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  Now we learn they were shooting Guatemalan men, women and children up with syphilis.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  Now we learn this year that source CBS News, but they bury it in the article.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  The UN is going all over the world, Africa, Asia, Latin America,
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  giving children weaponized polio, telling them it's a polio vaccine.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  I mean, Project Shad, tens of thousands of our troops from the 1940s right through the 1980s,
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  declassified, they would nerve gas our troops in some cases,
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  kill them and tell their families they died of the flu.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  And they do that to create cadres, armies of doctors and scientists
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  that will do anything crazy they're told, and that's what this TSA army is about.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  We've confirmed from TSA insiders that the last couple months they call them in
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  and they say, are you for the naked body scanners?
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  Are you concerned about radiation?
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  Are you concerned about touching people's genitals?
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  And if they say I am concerned, they're given a pink slip and laid off.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  So they're culling through and creating an army of pedophiles, control freaks, idiots, morons,
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  people on power trips.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  They're profiling society and finding scum.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  Give me your view on that.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  The basic point of it is that anyone that would do this, there's something wrong with that person
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  because if I walk up to anyone, again, the whole color, color doesn't matter,
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  whether you're blue or yellow, who wants someone else touching their private part?
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  Especially a stranger.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  It would be different if they got my uncle down there to do it or somebody I knew for 20 years
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  and said, hey, bring somebody else's nose, we're going to have them patch it down.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  Maybe I'd feel okay with it.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  Before a stranger with a blue elastic glove on, put their hands anywhere near me,
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  again, it's unsanitary, it's disgusting, it's evasive, and they usually want to take you
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  in private to do it.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  And those are all kinds of signs that these people are creepy and weird.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  They step behind a shielded screen.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  Oh, don't even talk about that.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  When they're doing the X-rays, their side is shielded.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  They've got lead protection.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  They're sitting behind a lead wall looking at you.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  That's another good point I noticed.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  There is some type of lead wall.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  And when they run them system, they do get behind it.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  That's a key point I hadn't thought to talk about.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  There's so many facets.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  They're telling us it's safe, but they're hiding behind shielding.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  Again, my dentist puts a metal plate on my chest and then runs into another room to click the button.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  These guys don't even give me a metal plate.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  They just run around their wall and click the button.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  It's not safe.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  People are going to have their hair falling out in 15 years and it's not a joke.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  It's radiation.
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  All I know is radiation is bad.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  I'm not a scientist.
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  I'm not even that smart.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  But all I know is that when I go to my doctor, they put protection on me and then they still leave the room.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  To turn on the machine.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  Well, we know top scientists have come out.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  Major, the Atomic Energy Agency, they've all said these things are x-rays.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  They're very, very dangerous.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  And you've just made a lot of amazing points here.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  Anything else you want to add, Owen?
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  Just thanks for having me on the show.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  I'm not here to plug myself, so if somebody finds me on the Internet, say hi.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  If you don't, have a great day.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  Yeah, give us the websites again because I guarantee you with this up on the Drugs Report,
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  you're going to have a bunch of newspapers and TV, probably.
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  Good morning, America.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  I had a news organization call me while I was online with you.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  I had to turn them down.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  I'll call them back later.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  The ONGJstone.com is the easiest way to get me.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  I'm wondering how people could find me.
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  All right, we'll talk to you as this unfolds and develops.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  But bottom line, you did feel violated.
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  Did you feel molested by him patting your genitals?
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  I felt violated.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  If I felt molested out of punch from the face, I'd probably be in jail right now because, again,
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  and the only reason he did that is because he was apologetic and I had it in public.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  If it would have been in private, I'd probably be in a cell or something.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  Did you hear about the TSA worker who they made fun of the size of his member every day
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  so he punched his boss in the nose and then he got arrested?
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  Violation of privacy.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  Why am I getting punched in the face when a man sexually harassing me talking about my private parts to my face?
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  Why isn't that man arrested? Why isn't he fired?
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Talking about my private parts, that's special harassment.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  Well, it's more than that.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  You got me all fired up.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  Well, no, you're awesome. I look forward to having you back home.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  Maybe I can have you some time on a better connection filling on the show
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  because you definitely are an informed person and I think we're on the same page.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  All right, well, thanks for coming on with us, Ellen.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  Thanks for having me.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  You bet.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, I can only add people for three weeks, a minority of people.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  I mean, I could give you Valhalla on a silver platter and people would complain,
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  but I've seen this fake meme being put out probably by operatives of
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  why is Alex spending hours every day talking about the TSA?
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  Because if they're able to get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  If they can touch your genitals and now, see now, three weeks ago, it's pat outside.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  First, it's back of the hands, then it's inside of the hands, then it's squeeze.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  Now it's we're going to stick our hands in your pants.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  And it's not just because I know how the TSA will operate.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  They'll come out and say, oh, it's not telling the truth.
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  Oh, really?
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  We have a clips of newscast with the news reporting it with other people.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  See, first it's we're just going to run our hands in your waistband.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  So now I'm going to stick my hands in your pants and patch your rear end.
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  I'm going to patch your, I mean, this is going on.
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  This is happening.
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  And I can only salute the Drudge Report.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  9 billion page views in the first 11 and a half months or I guess 10 and a half months
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  because we've got a month and a half left in the year.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  It's the 16th day of November 2010 in 10 and a half months.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  9 billion page views, 9 billion.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  We are getting millions of readers a day on top of the millions we already get from the Drudge Report.
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  We salute the Drudge Report for understanding how key this issue is.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  It was the Drudge Report three weeks ago that began to pick up our video clips, our, our, our, our, our articles.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  And then other people started complaining and other people started standing up and other people started saying no.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  And now it's just the front page of every paper. It's, you know, we're not talking about some stupid royal wedding anymore.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  That's way down the page.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  We're now talking about real issues.
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  We're now talking about the government putting its hands on your genitals.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  The government in your pants.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  And we're now understanding that this is all a giant stinking fraud.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  And we now have the update on the article update.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  Oh, and JJ Stone appeared on the Alex Jones show today to discuss the incident and how the TSA goon touched his parts by specifically patting his backside and testicles.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  We need to add to that poll that I said and I am to we need to add Paul specifically inside his pants.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  That's the key.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  The hand was inside the pants inside the pants.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  So he needs to read Owen JJ Stone appear on the Alex Jones show today to discuss the incident and how he was embarrassed to tell the whole story previously.
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  He went public with the fact that the TSA agent while apologizing profusely put his hand inside his pants and padded his genitals and gluteus maximus.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  Get me Watson online.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  He's probably already listening. Just get me on. Get him online, please.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  As I go to break here in a moment, I want to specifically give him the update.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  So it's specifically what is there.
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  This is a big update to this national story that Owen JJ Stone.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  You notice he was kind of hesitant.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  The first time he told it, he was like, and then he kind of put his hand on my pants.
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  He touched my profits.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  Oh, I pressed him on.
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  I said, what do you do specifically put his hand all the way around his thighs on his buttocks on the buttocks.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  In between the sweatpants and the underwear.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  So he didn't do it under the underwear on top of the underwear and patting.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  Then he went to the front, the front of his underwear and padded his testicles.
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  And I'm sorry to have to get into this on air.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  This is what the government's going to do to everybody.
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  Talking about it is good to expose it.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  What's bad is that they're doing it.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  So go ahead and dial Watson.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  I want to talk to him during the breaks to get this update done.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  Thank you.
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  Now we're going to come back from break.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  I know the collars are going to be all over the map and that's fine.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  We're going to go to Frank, Sean, Mike, James, Emmanuel and others.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  We got a bunch of economic news.
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  It's just more of the same.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  The bankers that have engineered the world collapse trying to get even more power and control out of what they've engineered.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  A lot of people are fighting it worldwide.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  The economic numbers continue to come in stock market plunging.
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  As we cover life inside the New World Order.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  Are the threats of a biological attack to the U.S. real?
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  If biological warfare is real, what should I know before it happens to protect my family?
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  The answers to the unthinkable are inside a new book by Christian patriot and author Sam Adams,
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  Pale Horse, How to Survive a Chemical or Biological Attack.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  Inside what's been called the must-have manual for surviving the attack and mass panic that will follow,
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  you will learn what the actual biological and chemical threats are,
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  how to respond to events that are almost certain to happen,
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  what the government's response is likely to be,
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  how some will take advantage of the chaos,
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  and exactly how you should prepare to get Pale Horse,
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  how to survive a chemical or biological attack in hard copy or immediate digital download,

[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard,
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  the U.S. dollar has been evaluating.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913,
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  The police state isn't coming.

[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  The alternative media is driving the news.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  Yesterday morning we found a online YouTube clip of a three-year-old screaming and crying
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  with the enhanced patdown.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  We wrote a story about it and today the San Francisco Chronicle has it.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  TSA Patdown's a screaming toddler.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  So it just shows how more and more we're driving the news
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  and again top link on drugs or some of the other news.
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  Stocks extend losses amid China, EU worries, sell-off, bond market, defies fed,
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  weaker dollars seen as unlikely to cure joblessness.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  Yeah, because there are no industries there.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  Even if the dollar goes down and that encourages manufacturing,
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  you can't compete with the Chinese because they're already at rock bottom.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  They're already, it's the giant sucking sound to the bottom.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  It's the race to the bottom.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  Frank, Sean, Mike, James, Emmanuel, and a few others.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  I will get to the economic news and some other key info.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  Let's go to Frank right now in Texas. Frank, you're on the air.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  Yeah, like I called last week, I mentioned to you that the TSA had kind of like wracked me in the crotch area
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  and I was back for another trip this past weekend and the patdown,
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  the guy who did the patdown was actually, you could tell he felt bad.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  He was loving, he was more, but yeah, but they admit this pressure thing.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  Let me make sure that in the bomb. Yeah, and I guess the guy had the problem was with the guy,
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  the TSA guy checking my ticket and I had a driver's license that expired just by two days,
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  but I had my passport with me and he kept wanting to know when I was going to go renew my license.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  And I said, look, buddy, I'm flying. I'm not driving. What's it to you?
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  And he said, well, aren't you going to drive when you get to Dallas this weekend?
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  And I lost it and I said, you know what? If I feel like driving, I will.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  And if I won't, if I don't, I won't.
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  No, see, see, he wants to boss you around. It has nothing to do with stopping terrorists.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  His bosses launched the attack and he knows it. It's about letting you know slave,
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  you belong to the government. We're going to be sucking a lot more off of you
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  and we're here to train you that we are the master.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  So it's any excuse to get in your business. He's some powerless person who couldn't get a job cleaning porta-potties,
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  but now he gets to tell, so he finds one little thing he gets to let you know.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  And I had, I had okayed it with him the week before. They said, yeah, you know,
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  as long as you're on a criminal, we'll let the expiration be one year over the date and you're okay.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  But to my surprise, when I told him, I would renew it or I would drive if I felt like it.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  But you didn't even need the driver's license. You could have just had the passport.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  But when I told him that, I thought he'd blow up and he got red in the face.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  But guess what Alex, he didn't come back with a single sound.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  What did you say to this God? What did you say to this ruler?
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  He told me, what are you going to, aren't you going to drive this weekend in Dallas?
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  And I said, if I feel like it, I will. If I don't feel like it, I won't.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  And I expected, you know, to be escorted to the back.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  He didn't say a word and the Border Patrol guys next to him started laughing because we're on the border.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  And I just, you know, walked through, got a real decent pat down and I was glad I finally told that guy to shut up.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  And, you know, I was just surprised.
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  What did they say, you know, a barking dog never bites.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  And I think that was a case right here.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  Well, look, again, they've been told, brutalize these people, drive them into submission.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  The globalists are getting ready to take the Social Security.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  They're getting ready to take large portions of the bank accounts.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  They're getting ready to really slap us around.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  And they created this culture of worshiping the police state, worshiping our oppressors.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  It's over. And it starts with this TSA issue.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  I'm telling you, folks, this is big.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  This is only the beginning as people stand up and say no to tyranny.
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  Let's talk to Sean and Georgia. Sean, you're on the air.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  Hello, Alex.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  Hello, Evil Al-Qaeda.
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  Alex, how you doing, sir?
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  Good. Go ahead.
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  Hey, this is Sean and Georgia.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  I just wanted to follow up with you is that, you know, just hearing about these body scanners and intrusiveness.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  You know, it's a little disturbing, but I made a couple of notes.
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  You know, you're going with somebody's as evening where it's PJ's,
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  but I think that you should market InfoWars to JP's junk protection.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  InfoWars.com, so when somebody goes to the body scanner, they can see,
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  just like the guy had believed for anything else is, the person's protected.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  You should come up with a contest, even much like an auto dealer, offers, you know,
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  a million-dollar prize if somebody wins a Super Bowl by so much or whatever.
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  But the first contestant and the first person that sues the TSA and wins,
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  she gets a million dollars. You know, you can work with them and do that.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  Well, they're being sued, but I mean, I don't have a million dollars.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  No, no, no, no. What I meant by this is, you know how the auto dealer does a publicity spot
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  where they'll say, hey, we'll pay a third party vendor $100,000, $50,000.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  And only in the condition is, you know, if they made three touchdowns or if they win by so much.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  So if you put some type of contest like you did before with your body scanners,
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  it's getting so much publicity. It would really seem a key opportunity,
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  or a key point for you to go ahead, move forward, and do something with that
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  to keep you in the news. More people are informed about.
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  No, Sean, that's a great idea. Why don't you write that up and send it to us?
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  You know, that reminds me, we did our naked body scanner protest contest, what,
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  seven, eight, nine months ago? It was early this year.
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  And people are like, well, this isn't going to do anything. Yes, it raises awareness
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  to the next plateau than the next plateau. It takes time to discredit and defeat the globalist.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  Resistance is victory. The act of resistance and perseverance.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  It ended on June of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees,
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver,
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect. They both make fabulous investments.
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.

[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  It's like an R2-D2 high-tech water cooler without the water bottle.

[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  The folks at Food Production Systems have put together an amazing DVD resource that shows you how to build
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  a food production machine out of a small space in an urban environment.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  Everything you need to know from composite, composting to water collection, from canning to butchering.

[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  Okay, I've got to hurry now through your call because I want to get into report.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  Foreclosure mess could threaten banks. Associated Press.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  We told you that 10 years ago and last month.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  But now, here it is, mainstream news.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  And, of course, there's been a threat so they'll need more of our money and then the threat just gets bigger.
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  It's like Greece and Spain and Portugal and Ireland.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  Oh, we got to have this bailout or we'll go belly up a few months later.
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  We got to have a bailout or we'll go belly up.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  And the bankers just love it because it's taxpayer money bailing it out, but it isn't bailing it out.
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  It's mathematically impossible to pay it back through the fractional reserve system.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  It's a takeover. It's designed.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  It's like some poor guy, you know, at the roulette table who's lost a million dollars.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  He's in hawk for another million and he just thinks he's going to get out of the hole.
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  You're not. The house is going to win.
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  Let's go to Mike in Wyoming. Mike, you're on the air.
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  How you doing, Alex?
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  Pretty good.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  I'm wondering where the, as a Christian, I want to where the Christian outcries that.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  I mean, uh, this is ridiculous. I mean, we, we've got preachers.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  Well, the new Christian religion is obsessing and getting scared of Muslims and talking about them all day and hating them.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  And, you know, let's just hypothetically say Muslims are the devil.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  I don't believe that, but let's just say they're pure evil out to get us.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  Why is 95% of Homeland Security aimed at gun owners, Christians, conservatives, returning veterans?
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  This isn't for the Muslims.
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  This is for the American people and property owners.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  And of course they worship tyranny.
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  They, you know, I've seen Pat Robertson say, take a chip.
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  It's of the Lord biometrics. It's of the Lord.
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  It's all of the Lord to have your wife and children fondled because these aren't Christian churches.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  These are 501c3 government whorehouses who are there by and large to submit to this tyranny.
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  That's a great point, Mike. Finish up.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  Yeah, where are the churches talking about this?
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  They're telling people Romans 13, Hal Hitler, and that was his favorite Bible verse, do what government tells you when that's not what Romans 13 actually says.
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  Go ahead.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  Well, we've got a rogue government.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  I mean, we lost our government when they threw out the Constitution.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  96% in a Reuters poll say they're not going to fly and they want the machines removed.
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Now, this is a government for and by the people.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  So, render unto Caesar, we are the government.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  I mean, but see, we're not Caesar in this country.
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  A bunch of corrupt devilish banks are and the average Christian church just can't lick enough boots.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  Well, we, you know, we sat down for abortion.
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  I mean, we got 50 million.
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  They think it's of the Lord.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  They think it killing babies is good.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  We sat down for homosexuality and now we got that running rampant and now we sat down for pornography and now we got it in the in the airports.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  I mean,
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  Well, it's an active submission.
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  If they can get away with this, the sky, look, I've got the federal documents where they're going to take blood to get a driver's license.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  That's why they've got grants to have cops take blood without warrants for DWI.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  That's just to train medical cadres of police.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  Well, I'm just a little confused.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  I mean, I, I, I, I, my son got in some trouble and he broke into a place and he took some girls underwear and he got six years in jail for that.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  And, and, and, uh, uh, I, I went to a church and I tried to explain to the preacher and he said, I will be watching your son.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  And any, any stepping out of line, uh, we're going to be coming down on him.
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  I mean, what is this?
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call, Mike.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  The way this works is if somebody's 18 and their girlfriend's 17, he's going to spend five years in jail for statutory rape.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  But if a jail guard rapes somebody, he's not going to get in trouble.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  Or the bad guys overseas, they torture, but when our government tortures, it's good.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  Or when the TSA sticks their hands in your pants, it's good.
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  But if you stick your hands in their pants, they're going to probably kill you.
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  So again, we've been trained to just put up with government corruption that all the banks steal money.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  That's what they do.
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  All the politicians lie.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  That's what they do.
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  And so we put up with more, more, more, more until there's that breaking point.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  The system is counted on us just blindly going along.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  But now it's gotten so wild that people are waking up.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  The level of tyranny you will live under, the level of government tyranny you will live under is exactly the amount you put up with.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  And he went on to describe that it's unscalable.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  It's maximum.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  Even if you don't have really evil tyrants in power right now, which we do, but hypothetically we didn't, you build the systems for abuse.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  The criminals will get in and use it for abuse.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  You build something that can be abused.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  It will be abused.
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  And since 1947, we've had total national security secrecy and trillions of dollars disappear into a black hole.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  Of course, the government ships in the narcotics.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  Of course, the government's been caught running giant child kidnapping rings in congressional hearings and no one gets in trouble.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  It's so absurdist.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  It's so bizarre.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  It's so off the charts that they can ask Rumsfeld four years ago.
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  Why is Dinecore allowed to operate in government contracts when it's been caught kidnapping children by the hundreds of thousands?
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  And Rumsfeld said, well, I believe they went in a penalty box and were given a fine for that.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  So see, JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs gets a $500 million fine on stealing hundreds of billions.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  Just in bonuses alone, they got $14 million for their execs.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  Let me see.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  $13 billion in bonuses, $500 million out of that.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  They just write it off as a loss.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  I mean, it's like what I talked about Sunday.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  I noticed it was on the front page of YouTube today.
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  I'm glad folks know what's important.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:56.000]  They announced all over our news, oh my gosh, we found uranium and radium isotopes in every major Texas water supply.
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  And we don't know why it's there, but the story was, but the state and the feds covered it up for 20 years.
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  CBS News broke it.
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  And in five minutes, I went and pulled up the data.
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  I already knew it.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  They mined this stuff out of limestone phosphate, the same place they mined uranium and other isotopes.
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  It's in the fluoride.
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  It isn't just fluoride they put in your water.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  It's hundreds of chemicals.
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  It's the toxic waste left over from phosphate mining.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  Before that broke last Friday, three days before I had Dr. Connit.
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  I had Dr. Connit with the case against fluoride.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  He wrote it with James Beck MD as well.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  And I already knew this, but I didn't take it like it was serious.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  You just get conditioned to accept this stuff.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  And it goes on to talk about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency required mandatory reclamation of industry waste products.
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  For example, Florida's typical phosphate rock, which is mined to produce the phosphate used in the fertilizer industry,
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  contains naturally occurring uranium-238 and radium-226, the latter of which gives birth the deadly radon gas.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  And it goes on.
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  Where does Austin, Texas, get the fluoride that we pay a million plus dollars a year for to be put in our water?
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  See, they'd have to pay to put that in a toxic waste dump, but instead we pay to drink it.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  It comes out of Florida, it comes out of famous mining areas where they did most of the mining for the original atomic bomb.
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  Now, you can sit there with a yuppie news reporter and explain all that to them and they just don't connect.
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  They're like, do you understand they're not just putting fluoride in the water?
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  And you'll look at them straight in the eyes.
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  I've done this before and they'll go, fluoride is good for your teeth.
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  And I go, listen, let's say fluoride is good for you, which it isn't.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  Doubles, cancer in the bones, on and on.
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  Do you understand that there's arsenic, lead, mercury, uranium, radium?
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  That's that the toxic waste that they can't put in fertilizer, they put in our water.
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  Do you read me?
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  And they'll just change the subject.
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  They cannot get serious.
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  Do you understand that your children in almost every city where we're fluoridated are drinking uranium?
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  And their answer is just to come out and say, you know, mercury is good for children.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  Remember Jesse Ventura's TV show last Friday where he's talking to the congressman about the FEMA camps?
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  He goes, well, they're happy children in the FEMA camps.
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  All right, I said I'd take your calls.
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  It's just all so insane.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  James in Michigan, you're on the air.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  Go ahead.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  Good.
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  Gotta move quick.
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  Sorry.
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  Go ahead.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  Okay.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  What I want to bring into light that I haven't heard anybody say, what if this is one of the tactics that the government's doing to control the population because it affects the private area?
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  This could be one of their tactics to control the population because it affects your, you know, your sperm.
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  Say that again. I mean, explain to me what you're saying.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  Well, like when you go in for an X-ray, they put up, they block your private areas.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  But when you go through that machine, it's wide open.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  Yes.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  And wouldn't that affect, you know, for you having a kid, if you get, you know, radiated so much?
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  Absolutely.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  It's eugenics.
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  Right.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:56.000]  Very well said.
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:03.000]  And another thing I'd like to say to Alex real quick is there's, in Mount Clemens, Michigan, there was a CEO banker that died.
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:08.000]  And I believe it was all covered up through the system.
[2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  The examiner that did the exam didn't find a bullet hole in his head.
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  He had a bullet in his lung.
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  And the family took it upon herself to hire another examiner.
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  And he found a bullet in the back of his head and a bullet in his lung.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  But yet the other examiner was like, oh, sorry.
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  And he said that, you know, that he committed suicide.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  Yeah.
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  The government lies even when the truth would serve them better.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  By the way, on Alexa.com, they show the hottest website in the world today.
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  The hottest news story in the world is TSA now putting hands down flyers pants.
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  Drudge Report has made infowars.com story number one on the internet.
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  Absolutely amazing.
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  Absolutely amazing to have that happening.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  And I got a big line of people outside the door.
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  Aaron, what's going on?
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  Watson has just informed me we have a top story on Alexa.
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  Yeah, I'm glad.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  That's why I love my office and I encourage it that they had just told me and they came running and told me the same thing.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  And, you know, this is so valuable.
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  This is not Lindsay Lohan being the top story.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  This is not Prince William or Twitley or whatever his name is being, you know, being coordinated with his new BEMBO girlfriend.
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  This is a substantive issue.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  This is so exciting.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  This is very exciting, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  And it's all because of our hard work getting the info out, you spread the word about the show and the Drudge Report.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  Let's talk to Emmanuel in Minnesota.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  Thanks for holding Emmanuel.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  Hey, are you doing that?
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  Good, I'm doing good.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  What's on your mind?
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  I just wanted to say thank you for, you know, all the work that you do.
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  It's greatly appreciated.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  You know, I tell my friends and family that, you know, they have to wake up and smell the coffee.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  You know, that the government doesn't care about them and they look at me as if I'm crazy, you know.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  I'm African American and I voted for Ron Paul.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  Why?
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  Because he was pushing towards the agenda, the agenda that, you know, needs to be looked at.
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  But of course they looked at me as if I was crazy when they were looking at the current president and voting for him simply because they look like him.
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  Who's the idiot?
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  But anyway, what I wanted to get at is, you know, I was listening to your show and you were talking about what's going on at the airport.
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  A best friend of mine, he had an expired ID and he came from, he's from LA and he came out here to Minneapolis.
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  And before he got, before he got to Minneapolis, they brought him into a room, you know, they stripped him and threatened him.
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  And he told me this and I'm like, well, wait a minute, is this really happened to you?
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  So I'm like, yeah, let me, let me explain.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  That's confirmed as well.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  If they can find any excuse, because don't just think everybody now gets their genitals grabbed.
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  Now they take you behind closed doors and stripped you down to your underwear or even naked and they even have same sex now doing it or the opposite sex doing it in some of the cases.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  And so what's the next thing it's going to be putting their hands inside you?
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  So, so what did he say they did just stripped him down?
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  No, no, what happened to me as well.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  I also went out to LA and it's the same thing.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  I had an expired ID and I wanted to see what would happen dragged into a room.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  Where are you going?
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  You know, I'm like, you can look at my ticket for you.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  I'm like, well, they stripped you to humiliate you.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  That's in the CIA torture dossies.
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  Stay there. Stay there.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  I want to hear the rest of this.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt free in just 90 days.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days and it works.
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  For all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  So I used the program methods and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  There is no other program of its kind.
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  Stay with me along when creditors gang up on you.

[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  Somebody is going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  You are being warned.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  Don't tread on me.
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  Rise of the Republic.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  The tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  A new tool in the Info War.
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  Don't tread on me.

[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  Thank you.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  Thank you.

[2:56:55.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  Thank you.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  Thank you.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:58:13.000]  Thank you.
[2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  Thank you.
