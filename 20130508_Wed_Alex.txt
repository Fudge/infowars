[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.840 --> 00:24.160]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.160 --> 00:31.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the eighth day of May 2013. I'm your host, Alex
[00:31.600 --> 00:36.880]  Jones, and we're going to be covering the shock testimony that's expected from Benghazi
[00:36.880 --> 00:37.880]  witnesses.
[00:37.880 --> 00:43.320]  A fourth whistle-blower has been blocked from testifying. National security now publicly
[00:43.320 --> 00:48.480]  used to protect the criminal government. Senator says the dam is about to break. Operation
[00:48.480 --> 00:55.140]  Smear already underway. Former UN ambassador from the US, Bolton, says this could bring
[00:55.140 --> 00:59.960]  down the administration. Really, you think so?
[00:59.960 --> 01:07.660]  And Cheney rips leadership, Hillary in spotlight. And the Benghazi hearings are now underway.
[01:07.660 --> 01:14.880]  We are going to be monitoring this entire situation. And obviously, judgereport.com
[01:14.880 --> 01:19.080]  is going to be monitoring it. But infowars.com, prisonmonitor.com are gonna be on it. We're
[01:19.080 --> 01:23.760]  gonna be grabbing clips of this as it unfolds.
[01:23.760 --> 01:27.840]  In fact, you guys have the audio plotted in where you can feed that Benghazi hearing in
[01:27.840 --> 01:34.480]  right now? Perhaps we should do that. And we'll do that in just a moment. And again,
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.160]  we'll continue to cover all of this. This is the exact time that the globalist could
[01:40.160 --> 01:45.320]  stage some type of false flag or war, like they're trying to do in Syria, to distract
[01:45.320 --> 01:51.240]  away from what happened in Benghazi, where there was a stand down for eight hours with
[01:51.240 --> 01:55.720]  predator drones overhead and a CIA torture base down the street.
[01:55.720 --> 02:00.500]  Why was there a stand down? They wanted him dead. They wanted something covered up. It
[02:00.500 --> 02:05.060]  wasn't just, we don't wanna have a fight with our al-Qaeda security forces that have double
[02:05.060 --> 02:10.360]  crossed as it's so embarrassing. They don't care. They'd say, Obama did a great job taking
[02:10.360 --> 02:17.640]  out al-Qaeda. They already taken over Libya. This was covering up the arms transfers that
[02:17.640 --> 02:20.880]  that individual had been over.
[02:20.880 --> 02:24.880]  In fact, let's get Pechenik on tomorrow. I wanna get his take for like 15, 20 minutes.
[02:24.880 --> 02:28.680]  Maybe just have Lord Moncton on for 30, cut him down to 30. So I wanna look at UKIP's
[02:28.680 --> 02:34.880]  victories in England. But we've also got one of the heads of UKIP coming on. But Mr. Bloom,
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.120]  but I wanna get Pechenik to pop in, get his take on all of this show.
[02:40.120 --> 02:46.080]  We're going to be following all of this today. Let's go ahead and go to some of the hearing
[02:46.080 --> 02:47.080]  right now.
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.840]  There is sometimes the hesitancy to not-
[02:50.840 --> 02:52.240]  It's Mark Thompson.
[02:52.240 --> 02:54.240]  Deploy because we don't know what's going on.
[02:54.240 --> 02:55.240]  It's the acting department secretary.
[02:55.240 --> 02:58.240]  One definition of a crisis is you don't know what's gonna happen in two hours.
[02:58.240 --> 02:59.240]  It's counter-terrorism.
[02:59.240 --> 03:01.040]  So you need to help develop that situation early.
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.080]  It was eight hours.
[03:02.080 --> 03:08.840]  We have a robust comms suite on the airplane that we are transported on. It is ably flown
[03:08.840 --> 03:11.080]  by my SOCOM colleagues.
[03:11.080 --> 03:15.520]  Let's stop right there. All these guys ever do is thank all their colleagues. We get it.
[03:15.520 --> 03:21.280]  We'll give you a red carpet, bro. How about red toilet paper? You're so royal. Okay, a
[03:21.280 --> 03:25.920]  red diaper. But my whole, seriously, I mean, it's not enough to have white toilet paper.
[03:25.920 --> 03:28.280]  They gotta have red toilet paper because they're gods.
[03:28.280 --> 03:35.840]  They walk upon the stars. That's where the whole Greek idea, the red carpet for the gods
[03:35.840 --> 03:40.500]  and the red carpet for the lords. And it's just, again, Graham's like, this could bring
[03:40.500 --> 03:41.500]  them down.
[03:41.500 --> 03:47.100]  We had total system failure. Ooh, that's what Senator Graham says is coming out. And so
[03:47.100 --> 03:52.000]  far it sounds like whitewash city. But we'll find out. I mean, are these brave whistleblowers?
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.260]  Maybe, but get to the meat of it. Okay, we know there were aircraft all over the place,
[03:58.260 --> 04:06.960]  over the med, 30, 40 miles away, over 10,000, 20,000 feet in the air, over this in Benghazi.
[04:06.960 --> 04:10.040]  We know what went on. So let's go back to it briefly.
[04:10.040 --> 04:14.180]  That works for the chief of mission, and I can't emphasize that enough. We are not there
[04:14.180 --> 04:23.920]  to subsume any activities. The experts on the team know that the real experts are in
[04:23.920 --> 04:30.060]  the embassy. And they work for the chief of mission to do that. My time is drawing to
[04:30.060 --> 04:33.360]  a close. I'll end there and await your questions.
[04:33.360 --> 04:37.660]  Thank you. Mr. Hicks.
[04:37.660 --> 04:38.660]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[04:38.660 --> 04:42.200]  Thank you. We really will have to, you're pretty soft smoke and get a little closer.
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.080]  We'll try to get this up here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, ranking member.
[04:45.080 --> 04:49.080]  We're going to break, come back with more of this. But the first person to testify says
[04:49.080 --> 04:55.440]  he blames her. And we're going to be breaking all of this down and more. Big news, three
[04:55.440 --> 04:59.960]  guests a day. Stay with us.
[04:59.960 --> 05:05.360]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[05:05.360 --> 05:10.960]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

[07:59.680 --> 08:24.680]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[08:24.680 --> 08:31.280]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time ladies and gentlemen
[08:31.280 --> 08:38.080]  we are here. We also return weeknights 7 o'clock Central with Info Wars Nightly News hosted
[08:38.080 --> 08:44.560]  and anchored by myself and the rest of the great crew here. You are listening to the
[08:44.560 --> 08:50.640]  Info Wars Worldwide Transmission. I am your host Alex Jones.
[08:50.640 --> 08:57.640]  All right where to start? Obviously the Benghazi testimony has begun and they are expected
[08:58.280 --> 09:05.280]  to criticize the administration and say that they dropped the ball and Cheney is ripping
[09:05.320 --> 09:11.260]  the leadership saying they dropped the ball. Senator Graham is ripping the leadership saying
[09:11.260 --> 09:17.100]  that Obama dropped the ball. Obama didn't drop the ball or whoever controls him, whoever
[09:17.100 --> 09:22.800]  is running things. Whoever ordered the stand down did an excellent job exterminating those
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.240]  people and covering up the heat seeking missiles that were transferred. There's the headline
[09:27.240 --> 09:32.240]  Dick Cheney slams Obama administration's Benghazi performance as a failure of leadership.
[09:32.240 --> 09:39.240]  I cannot understand why they weren't ready as you sat in the Pentagon with a stand down
[09:39.720 --> 09:45.520]  on 9-11 or you sat in the Pentagon war room under the White House. Does the order still
[09:45.520 --> 09:48.520]  stand sir? It's 50 miles out. It's 30 miles out. It's 20 miles out sir. It's 10 miles
[09:48.520 --> 09:53.720]  out. Does the order still stand? Yes, the order still stands. Did someone tell you otherwise?
[09:53.720 --> 09:58.360]  That's been testified before Congress by the former transportation secretary and others
[09:58.360 --> 10:05.360]  and our reporters have talked to Mineta and he confirmed that indeed that's what went
[10:05.680 --> 10:12.480]  on. So it's just incredible. All these guys are globalist front men but Obama is the guy
[10:12.480 --> 10:19.480]  turbo charging the takeover. Obama on open borders, on internet taxes, on warrantless
[10:20.200 --> 10:24.200]  wire tapping which they're already doing. Now Obama is in the New York Times going yeah
[10:24.200 --> 10:30.920]  no more fourth amendment to keep you safe. I'll use executive orders to take your guns.
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.080]  I'll use executive orders to spy on everything you're doing. The big threat is libertarians
[10:35.080 --> 10:40.300]  and conservatives. Libertarians and conservatives are seen as the real populist. We are the
[10:40.300 --> 10:45.800]  group that's under attack but the average liberal in the street, because I talk to them,
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.500]  if they're informed is a good person who is a real liberal like Thomas Jefferson and they
[10:50.500 --> 10:57.180]  know Obama is an authoritarian. The problem is the trendy liberals and you've seen us
[10:57.180 --> 11:01.640]  interview them, you've seen Mark Dice interview them, 90 plus percent of them say ban all
[11:01.640 --> 11:07.760]  the guns, put libertarians in FEMA camps, have forced abortions, bring in authoritarian
[11:07.760 --> 11:13.260]  rule if Obama does it. If you say give Obama dictatorial power, they will say yes, give
[11:13.260 --> 11:18.560]  Obama dictatorial power. I'm gonna send my reporters back out in Austin and say to keep
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.720]  the children safe, should we let Obama have a third term and be given dictatorial power?
[11:24.720 --> 11:30.560]  Or to fix the budget deficit for Obamacare, should we have after birth abortion, post
[11:30.560 --> 11:36.480]  birth abortion? And I guarantee you, we'll probably get 80% of Austinites if we go to
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.480]  UT, if we go to the trendy areas. Now, if you went to a hard working blue collar area
[11:41.480 --> 11:45.920]  with conservatives and libertarians, or if you went to north of Austin or south of Austin,
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.040]  you'd probably get punched in the nose half the time.
[11:50.040 --> 11:56.240]  I mean, if Mark Dice did what he did in California here in, let's say, Dripping Springs, Texas
[11:56.240 --> 12:02.000]  out in the country. And of course, Mark said this himself, he'd get punched in the nose.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.840]  You might say, I'm gonna search your backpack without a warrant. I'm with the Obama Citizen
[12:05.840 --> 12:09.640]  Volunteer Force, and you kept pushing somebody going, no, I'm gonna search you. You'd get
[12:09.640 --> 12:12.240]  punched in the nose.
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.800]  You definitely get shoved. So we can't recreate that here in Austin cuz there's still some
[12:16.800 --> 12:23.560]  Americans left where I live in Texas. Or just human beings that have any common sense, we're
[12:23.560 --> 12:30.120]  gonna be getting into all that. I'm getting Adam Kokesh on at the bottom of the hour briefly.
[12:30.120 --> 12:36.000]  The police chief of the District of Criminals who looks like a comic book bad guy out of,
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.220]  she's like in a, he looks like a third world general outfit, but it's beyond that. It's
[12:40.220 --> 12:46.680]  like a Judge Dredd outfit. And it's another Janet Reno type, another, I guess from the
[12:46.680 --> 12:55.760]  same cloning tank that they get Big Sis and Janet Reno and Alberto Gonzales and that's
[12:55.760 --> 13:01.960]  a male version of Janet Napolitano and Michelle Maddow or Rachel Maddow or whatever his name
[13:01.960 --> 13:02.960]  is.
[13:02.960 --> 13:06.860]  The point is, is that you've got all this stuff going on. And they're saying if you
[13:06.860 --> 13:11.060]  try to walk across the bridge with guns, we're gonna arrest everybody. And she says it with
[13:11.060 --> 13:20.280]  this power tripping smile while she's festooned in a costume with a gun on her hip. Hey, I
[13:20.280 --> 13:27.800]  look like a crazy witch. I can have a gun, you can't, scum. I get to have security, you
[13:27.800 --> 13:28.800]  don't.
[13:28.800 --> 13:34.960]  I don't care if the Supreme Court four years ago in 2008 overturned what we do. We don't
[13:34.960 --> 13:41.520]  let anybody be armed here now, sucker, except our criminal gang. And again, people can,
[13:41.520 --> 13:47.860]  I'd say 60% of people are either scared or upset at Kokesh. And it's the timidness of
[13:47.860 --> 13:53.360]  this country to have an armed march on the Capitol, the White House.
[13:53.360 --> 13:59.200]  I have mixed feelings about it, but they have the right to do it. What DC is doing is illegal.
[13:59.200 --> 14:04.400]  I can only admire the courage. I haven't done it because discretion, I believe, is the greater
[14:04.400 --> 14:09.560]  part of valor. I'm willing to go get arrested, get a weapons charge, make a famous court
[14:09.560 --> 14:11.260]  case out of it.
[14:11.260 --> 14:15.780]  But I've chosen to try to full time fight on all these different fronts. But I have
[14:15.780 --> 14:22.640]  to still not cop out here and say Adam Kokesh has got a lot of courage. Some people are
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.400]  saying he's got to be a provocateur, blah, blah, blah. Jones is a provocateur promoting
[14:27.400 --> 14:33.160]  this. I'm not promoting it. I said, if you go, you should go with a camera as an observer.
[14:33.160 --> 14:34.160]  And that's what I said.
[14:34.160 --> 14:39.640]  So that's what will stop there being a provocateur setup. That's what will stop them from trying
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.680]  to pull something really nasty is if we have thousands of people there with cameras. I
[14:45.680 --> 14:52.080]  have said, I support his right to do it. I admire it at a certain animal level. But at
[14:52.080 --> 14:56.920]  the same time, I think it's a bad idea. Just like Lou Rockwell says, I don't go as far
[14:56.920 --> 14:59.920]  as Lou Rockwell saying, well, they can blame us for something.
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.200]  They could twist things. That's what they're gonna do anyways. I get Kokesh's point about,
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.720]  hey, don't use the thing of we can't have guns cuz somebody might do something wrong
[15:07.720 --> 15:13.260]  with them. I get all that. By the way, as these testimonies unfold, we'll give you the
[15:13.260 --> 15:18.040]  latest from infowars.com, prisonblinder.com, and you know who's all over it second by second
[15:18.040 --> 15:22.400]  with all his reporters and researchers, Matt Drudge.
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.660]  So we're out there watching it. The guys are watching it. They're thumbs up. It's more
[15:28.660 --> 15:34.040]  just thanking everybody and saying there was a failure and that the leadership failed,
[15:34.040 --> 15:40.400]  which is still a big deal. But it's a total whitewash. There was a stand down. There was
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.880]  a stand down. Let me say it again. There was a stand down. And we saw that in the press
[15:44.880 --> 15:50.440]  yesterday that whistleblowers are set to testify that there's gonna be a stand down.
[15:50.440 --> 15:56.720]  Guess what? I predicted on air, not hard to predict. It's like predicting that if you
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.780]  leave a big thing of honey out in a Colorado campsite that a bear is gonna come up and
[16:01.780 --> 16:06.840]  try to eat it if you're out there long enough. Or if you jump in a tank full of piranhas
[16:06.840 --> 16:10.760]  and cut yourself, they're gonna probably attack you. It's not a hard prediction. I said the
[16:10.760 --> 16:16.360]  real whistleblowers are gonna go tell Congress quietly, the staff, what they're gonna testify
[16:16.360 --> 16:17.360]  about.
[16:17.360 --> 16:20.920]  That's gonna be fed back by double agents to the globalist, to Obama, and then they're
[16:20.920 --> 16:26.040]  gonna be threatened and ordered not to testify. And there you go, fourth Benghazi witness
[16:26.040 --> 16:32.600]  gagged by red tape. So I now understand why you're gonna hear a whitewash out of anybody
[16:32.600 --> 16:37.400]  that testifies, cuz they're being told, you know what, you're gonna get indicted for violations
[16:37.400 --> 16:38.400]  of national security.
[16:38.400 --> 16:47.200]  See, they now use whistleblower laws and anti-whistleblower garbage to go after whistleblowers. I mean,
[16:47.200 --> 16:53.360]  if you report on crimes, robbery in government, if you report on your superior at the ATF
[16:53.360 --> 16:59.760]  shipping guns to Mexican drug cartels and being paid to do it, you will be indicted.
[16:59.760 --> 17:05.380]  If you, as a newspaper reporter, report on government connected banks laundering money,
[17:05.380 --> 17:09.320]  you will be indicted. If you report on the government protecting Al-Qaeda and you're
[17:09.320 --> 17:16.520]  a CIA asset, the FBI will come and arrest you and you will serve 13 months in prison.
[17:16.520 --> 17:23.600]  Now she, Belle Edmonds, she went public and broke her gag order before Obama came in.
[17:23.600 --> 17:28.600]  And she's so public and has already released her info, they haven't arrested her. What
[17:28.600 --> 17:32.960]  they do is when you release a little bit and then try to shop a book deal or whatever cuz
[17:32.960 --> 17:37.000]  you're not gonna have a job in government now, you need that money.
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.720]  You have a hit book, you might make a half million dollars, sounds like a lot. Hey, you
[17:40.720 --> 17:44.240]  got ten more years in government service, you've lost your pension fund now, you need
[17:44.240 --> 17:49.160]  that money. They're not shopping books cuz they're bad people. They're shopping books
[17:49.160 --> 17:53.160]  cuz they, well, I'm gonna go all the way and tell the truth instead of selling out.
[17:53.160 --> 17:57.720]  You sell out and lie, you get promoted, I better shop a book. And while you're shopping
[17:57.720 --> 18:05.240]  that book, that information's all being given to the government. I know, ladies and gentlemen,
[18:05.240 --> 18:12.960]  I know. And so this is the type of stuff that is going on. And so you're just gonna hear,
[18:12.960 --> 18:14.880]  they dropped the ball, they screwed up.
[18:14.880 --> 18:20.040]  That's all I can tell you cuz I'm not allowed to tell you. In fact, let's fade back up the
[18:20.040 --> 18:23.920]  report and go out to break with it and I'll come back with all the big news. Big Second
[18:23.920 --> 18:28.200]  Amendment, big economic, big immigration news. It's all coming up, but let's go ahead and
[18:28.200 --> 18:29.200]  fade up the-
[18:29.200 --> 18:33.560]  Early in the morning at the annex about a couple miles away. And then of course, there's
[18:33.560 --> 18:38.440]  how did the White House respond to this? When it became clear that this was a terrorist
[18:38.440 --> 18:41.560]  attack, these officials saying that they knew it immediately. The White House pushed back
[18:41.560 --> 18:46.600]  on that, suggested this was a spontaneous protest as a result of that anti-Muslim video.
[18:46.600 --> 18:47.600]  So there are a lot of-
[18:47.600 --> 18:51.100]  Let's stop right there. That's enough, we'll come back with more. Yeah, yeah. You got eight
[18:51.100 --> 18:57.240]  hours of people launching rockets and using anti-aircraft artillery on the ground, firing
[18:57.240 --> 19:03.400]  large caliber. I mean, we're talking stuff four or five times bigger than 50 cal, hang
[19:03.400 --> 19:05.860]  grenades into it, it's on fire.
[19:05.860 --> 19:10.600]  There's a base less than a mile away, they order him to stand down. And they're like,
[19:10.600 --> 19:14.920]  it isn't a terror attack. And then we never said it wasn't a terror attack, it was a terror
[19:14.920 --> 19:18.120]  attack. Remember that you're like, you said it wasn't a terror attack. Remember all those
[19:18.120 --> 19:23.240]  mind games? We're not buying bullets, we're not buying armored vehicles, there's no FEMA
[19:23.240 --> 19:24.240]  camps.
[19:24.240 --> 19:28.680]  Really, here's the army manual, declassified. It says in FEMA camp, re-education center
[19:28.680 --> 19:34.640]  for political dissidents. It says re-education camp. I'm not calling it that, it says it.
[19:34.640 --> 19:45.440]  That doesn't exist, crazy man, army.mil. Okay, nutball. Because they know the general public
[19:45.440 --> 19:49.200]  that even watches news. You know, the dumbed down public that came and tied their shoelaces.
[19:49.200 --> 19:53.040]  People that watch news don't know how to check stuff on average. So they're sitting there
[19:53.040 --> 19:58.000]  believing all this. And look, they ordered to stand down and they murdered those people,
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.120]  the White House did.
[20:00.120 --> 20:04.640]  Are you one of the millions of Americans worried about change? Do you lose sleep over what
[20:04.640 --> 20:08.160]  could happen to your assets and hard earned money? Are you looking for a better way of

[20:12.700 --> 20:17.760]  these questions, you should consider investing in the country of Belize. Belize is an independent

[20:22.680 --> 20:28.000]  laws. In fact, Belize is one of the last tax havens left in the world today. Belize also
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.980]  has a very low cost of living, tropical climate and is home to some of the best real estate

[24:10.240 --> 24:26.720]  Some folks are born, made to wait to fly. Red, white and blue. Red, white and blue.
[24:26.720 --> 24:33.520]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief, Lord knows they point the cannon at you. Don't
[24:33.520 --> 24:34.520]  say.
[24:34.520 --> 24:41.880]  All right, we'll continue to cover the Benghazi whitewash. They didn't know they screwed up.
[24:41.880 --> 24:47.280]  They said it was a protest. They've got predator drones over it with people launching grenades
[24:47.280 --> 24:55.880]  and rolling up. Truck carried anti aircraft guns firing into the building for hour after
[24:55.880 --> 25:04.600]  hour after hour with CENTCOM off the coast on aircraft carriers watching all of it in
[25:04.600 --> 25:09.200]  infrared and high def video.
[25:09.200 --> 25:13.400]  This is the type of stuff, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about and I will not be sucked
[25:13.400 --> 25:17.000]  into this big distraction. I mean, I think it's important to cover it, but to educate
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.520]  people how it's nothing but a giant distraction and a protest. I mean, remember how we were
[25:21.520 --> 25:26.880]  conspiracy theorists? We were in the news days after it happened saying it was not a
[25:26.880 --> 25:32.400]  protest over the Mohammed video that it turns out was connected to federal informants.
[25:32.400 --> 25:37.720]  I predicted it would be federal minions that put that out. It always is. I could take one
[25:37.720 --> 25:43.080]  look at it and see who produced it because I've seen it over and over again. It's like
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.920]  I can see a part of a movie on TV and go, I bet Jerry Bruckheimer made this. I'll search
[25:47.920 --> 25:54.320]  engine it. Yeah, it's Jerry Bruckheimer. Or who made this movie? I'll be in a hotel room
[25:54.320 --> 25:59.240]  and my wife will put something on TV at home and I'll go, this is Steven Spielberg movie.
[25:59.240 --> 26:04.660]  I bet, let me search it. I'll search it on the iPad, Steven Spielberg. I've learned.
[26:04.660 --> 26:10.080]  And they go, it was a protest. And I knew that that was them because when they attacked
[26:10.080 --> 26:15.020]  Libya, it was called a protest. When they bombed it, when NATO bombed it, when Obama
[26:15.020 --> 26:19.720]  bombed it, it was a protest. And I got on air and said, it's not a protest when you're
[26:19.720 --> 26:25.560]  bombing major cities with hundreds of flights a day and helicopters coming in.
[26:25.560 --> 26:31.960]  And now we're 26, seven months into the protest in Syria. And the West for the whole time
[26:31.960 --> 26:38.640]  has been giving armaments to Al-Qaeda. Just now, US to start arming Syrian rebels shortly,
[26:38.640 --> 26:42.580]  says the Republican ranking member of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[26:42.580 --> 26:46.280]  It's kind of like they announced yesterday in the Wall Street Journal in Bloomberg. Guess
[26:46.280 --> 26:52.880]  what? Cadillac and Volt are moving to China. They already opened factories years ago in
[26:52.880 --> 26:58.040]  China. When General Motors had to sign an agreement to move more factories, not just
[26:58.040 --> 27:02.060]  parts factories, but the actual factories to China.
[27:02.060 --> 27:06.320]  With the federal government, okay GM, you wanna be federalized, you want taxpayer money.
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.880]  You've got to move to China, Brazil and Eastern Europe. And I saw comments on Infowars yesterday
[27:11.880 --> 27:17.720]  going, why aren't you covering the GM just moved to China? Why don't you talk about offshore
[27:17.720 --> 27:19.760]  you piece of filth?
[27:19.760 --> 27:29.640]  Again, I apologize, I've only made films about it. Fall of the Republic covers it. We actually
[27:29.640 --> 27:35.200]  read the GM agreement. They're gonna move more than half of GM. They've already moved
[27:35.200 --> 27:38.100]  about half of that. They've already moved a quarter out. They're gonna move the other
[27:38.100 --> 27:44.340]  quarter out of the country. They're moving General Motors out of the country to be built
[27:44.340 --> 27:49.120]  by Foxcom type robots right next to the Apple slave factories.
[27:49.120 --> 27:56.480]  Oh, the people were already cheap. The people were already worthless. The people were already
[27:56.480 --> 28:03.380]  garbage, but now they're not even needed. Life isn't cheap now, it's obsolete. But in
[28:03.380 --> 28:08.200]  the world of mindless idiots, they can get away with this. There is a key article, document
[28:08.200 --> 28:12.520]  can please, and I wanna show this on screen coming up more when Adam Kokesh is on with
[28:12.520 --> 28:13.520]  us.
[28:13.520 --> 28:22.160]  This is a zero hedge article at infowars.com. And it says Americans convinced gun homicide
[28:22.160 --> 28:30.900]  sore despite actual plunge. This needs to get out to everyone everywhere now. And we
[28:30.900 --> 28:38.940]  added to it some of our numbers crunched by our office, Melissa Melton and others in here.
[28:38.940 --> 28:45.800]  She has a degree, I guess, in stats, 49% drop. I saw him say that on Fox. I was like, I thought
[28:45.800 --> 28:52.240]  it was only 20 something, but we went and did the numbers on fbi.gov, 49% drop in violent
[28:52.240 --> 28:55.000]  crime since 1991.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.600]  And here it is in yet another example of the massive gap between the American people's
[28:59.600 --> 29:04.600]  perception of what is going on around them, whether by propaganda channels or simply cognitive
[29:04.600 --> 29:10.880]  bias. And the actual reality, Reuters reports that while gun related homicides are down
[29:10.880 --> 29:16.300]  39%, that's gun, that's just gun from its peak in 93.
[29:16.300 --> 29:23.260]  Only 12% of American people believe that gun crimes have fallen. Yeah, non-traital firearm
[29:23.260 --> 29:32.780]  crimes declined by 69%. And 56% of Americans believe that gun crime is higher now than
[29:32.780 --> 29:37.900]  it was 20 years ago. That's Pew research. And then they've got from the Department of
[29:37.900 --> 29:44.820]  Justice there. They have to admit it, but this will get no publication. Guns are saving
[29:44.820 --> 29:53.660]  America. Guns, guns, guns. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:53.660 --> 30:02.620]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge
[30:02.620 --> 30:08.140]  losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US, costing us
[30:08.140 --> 30:12.660]  20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in
[30:12.660 --> 30:17.220]  more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will
[30:17.220 --> 30:23.060]  be affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[31:09.260 --> 31:14.020]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I
[31:14.020 --> 31:19.420]  immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are

[33:13.100 --> 33:30.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is just torture. I am tempted to carry this feed live off of
[33:30.700 --> 33:38.660]  C-SPAN because CNN and other channels were just obviously ordered to move away from the
[33:38.660 --> 33:45.140]  live Benghazi coverage. This is big bombshell breaking news. I've got computers and TVs
[33:45.140 --> 33:51.300]  on all over the office. So as I'm walking around going over more news, I am hearing
[33:51.300 --> 33:57.020]  and seeing what happened. They have Gregory Hicks of the State Department on right now.
[33:57.020 --> 34:02.600]  Go get the feed guy. They've got internet feeds right in there. And he starts talking
[34:02.600 --> 34:06.660]  about and I gotta say I'm eating crow here. I said it was a whitewash and they've been
[34:06.660 --> 34:09.860]  ordered to shut up. I guess these guys are patriots and he looks concerned when he's
[34:09.860 --> 34:14.300]  talking and he said, listen, they had C-130s ordered to stand down.
[34:14.300 --> 34:19.420]  They had aircraft. They said it was two hours. That's not true. This is a war zone. We had
[34:19.420 --> 34:24.180]  the aircraft there. They had predators with weapons on them right above it who could have
[34:24.180 --> 34:33.660]  taken these guys out and he is saying that it's a fraud. And right as this starts, I've
[34:33.660 --> 34:41.740]  got a video feed on via C-SPAN, a video live feed from CBS and I watch CNN.
[34:41.740 --> 34:49.620]  And then I walk in the coffee room where MSNBC is and I watch MSNBC both go to Anderson Cooper
[34:49.620 --> 34:53.580]  with some distractionary issues. So let's go to the live feed that we're going to Adam
[34:53.580 --> 34:58.380]  versus the man Adam Kokesh with his arm march on Washington. And then I want to show people
[34:58.380 --> 35:04.180]  CNN and what they're covering. Let's go to the real Benghazi feed from the House committee
[35:04.180 --> 35:06.340]  right now.
[35:06.340 --> 35:12.460]  And so we moved it on. And we arrived at the annex, at least my group, I think at about
[35:12.460 --> 35:28.100]  445, perhaps maybe 5 a.m. And a few minutes later came the word of the mortar attack.
[35:28.100 --> 35:34.580]  If I could return to Benghazi a little bit, talk through Triple M. Sorry if I bounce back
[35:34.580 --> 35:47.900]  and forth, but the Triple M team was basically had to stay at the Benghazi airport because
[35:47.900 --> 35:56.780]  they had no transport and no escort from the Libyans after-
[35:56.780 --> 36:03.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what real testimony looks like. His voice is shaking. He's not
[36:03.340 --> 36:07.900]  going over notes. He's putting his life on the line right now. This is what brings down
[36:07.900 --> 36:12.460]  tyranny right here. The one thing they fear, whistleblowers.
[36:12.460 --> 36:13.460]  So the decision was made-
[36:13.460 --> 36:20.020]  They stood down. They have been caught standing down. The security force, they ran. We told
[36:20.020 --> 36:26.740]  you this when it happened. It's now mainstream news that the State Department, CIA, security
[36:26.740 --> 36:32.300]  force hired in Benghazi are the ones that did the attack. They were ordered to do it.
[36:32.300 --> 36:35.220]  Who were they ordered to do it by?
[36:35.220 --> 36:42.340]  Come get him. And our local staff engaged on those phone calls, admirably.
[36:42.340 --> 36:50.420]  All right. Is CNN still not carrying the feed? Unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen, you've
[36:50.420 --> 36:55.980]  got bombshell historical stuff. I'm sitting there during the break watching him say it
[36:55.980 --> 36:58.100]  is not true that we couldn't have responded.
[36:58.100 --> 37:04.540]  We had aircraft, we had drones, we had everybody. They are not telling the truth. That is bombshell
[37:04.540 --> 37:10.740]  bigger than Watergate. I mean, this is like out of a movie. We have the live feeds up
[37:10.740 --> 37:15.780]  at infoawards.com right now. We have the live feeds, multiple feeds in case they try to
[37:15.780 --> 37:22.260]  cut them, right now of Mr. Hicks, the deputy head of counterterrorism for the State Department.
[37:22.260 --> 37:26.260]  And the deputy head's the guy that always actually runs things. Up there dropping bombshell
[37:26.260 --> 37:31.180]  after bombshell, and we're recording it too. On the nightly news, we'll have all the excerpts,
[37:31.180 --> 37:33.580]  and tomorrow on the radio, we'll have all the excerpts.
[37:33.580 --> 37:39.840]  But this is unprecedented. Now, I wanna shift gears into the Second Amendment with Adam
[37:39.840 --> 37:45.500]  Kokesh cuz he joined us on short notice and is very busy of adamversustheman.com, syndicated
[37:45.500 --> 37:51.380]  radio host, libertarian activist. But I don't wanna get his take on Benghazi first as well.
[37:51.380 --> 37:57.580]  He was in combat vet of Fallujah and other operations in Iraq when Fallujah was a giant
[37:57.580 --> 37:59.420]  genocide operation.
[37:59.420 --> 38:04.020]  He's spoken out against it. But the DC police chief has come out and said we will arrest
[38:04.020 --> 38:10.020]  Adam Kokesh and open carry protesters. And we're gonna play that here in just a moment.
[38:10.020 --> 38:14.140]  But Adam joining us via video Skype, your radio listener, you can go watch the feed
[38:14.140 --> 38:19.980]  at prisonplanet.tv. Adam, what is it like to see, I mean, again, these tyrants always
[38:19.980 --> 38:21.580]  think they're gonna get away with stuff.
[38:21.580 --> 38:26.460]  They ordered to stand down and the globalist-run security force funded by the CIA, that's now
[38:26.460 --> 38:31.500]  on record. Exactly what our incredible sources told us two days after it happened. I mean,
[38:31.500 --> 38:36.260]  we broke this again. And I have told my crew, go get our interviews from right after Benghazi.
[38:36.260 --> 38:39.620]  They go, when were they? They were the day after, the two days after, the three days
[38:39.620 --> 38:40.620]  after.
[38:40.620 --> 38:46.140]  We had Colonel Shaffer on. He got threatened over it. He ran black op operations against
[38:46.140 --> 38:49.340]  you name. It was ordered to stand down on bin Laden. And that's what he was told. We
[38:49.340 --> 38:54.540]  have all the witnesses. Why would they kill the ambassador? We know there was a weapons
[38:54.540 --> 38:58.500]  cash there. They were transferring to Al-Qaeda, including heat-seeking missiles.
[38:58.500 --> 39:03.500]  Were they getting rid of the people that transferred the weapons to Al-Qaeda? We know they did
[39:03.500 --> 39:08.360]  now. Al-Qaeda's bragged and said, America gave us these. They're shooting down Syrian
[39:08.360 --> 39:13.460]  aircraft with them. You're a Marine Corvette. You were also in psyops for the Marines. What
[39:13.460 --> 39:15.300]  do you make of what's going on here?
[39:15.300 --> 39:19.900]  Because this whole narrative, we're seeing something, let's not exaggerate, 100 times
[39:19.900 --> 39:24.660]  bigger than Watergate. Watergate was over breaking into the DNC to get the psychological
[39:24.660 --> 39:29.300]  records on your enemies. Nowadays, they just do that by tapping into your Internet. And
[39:29.300 --> 39:32.780]  they admit they do it, which is still wrong.
[39:32.780 --> 39:37.340]  What do you make of the magnitude of what we're seeing historically right now?
[39:37.340 --> 39:41.780]  Well, Alex, I'm grateful for the opportunity to come back on your show and for your coverage
[39:41.780 --> 39:45.500]  of the Benghazi hearing and what's going on right now, the incident in general. It's very
[39:45.500 --> 39:49.840]  important that we shed light on this. But to put it in the bigger context, what does
[39:49.840 --> 39:54.820]  this represent? What is the ultimate crime in terms of the administration that's being
[39:54.820 --> 39:56.220]  committed here?
[39:56.220 --> 40:00.740]  It's that they're making political decisions that cost people their lives. And this is
[40:00.740 --> 40:06.140]  not something new, as you well know. This is simply an incident where we have such clear,
[40:06.140 --> 40:10.740]  obvious facts in front of us. We can take this to the American people and say, look,
[40:10.740 --> 40:14.420]  this is what your government is doing. It is undeniable. There is evidence, there is
[40:14.420 --> 40:20.140]  testimony. It is absolutely clear that decisions were made for political reasons, and they
[40:20.140 --> 40:26.020]  resulted in the deaths of Americans who are supposedly honorably serving their country.
[40:26.020 --> 40:30.220]  What do we have now in our foreign policy around the world? What do we have with the
[40:30.220 --> 40:34.740]  domestic policy being created by this administration? It's the exact same thing, except that people
[40:34.740 --> 40:38.700]  are able to bury their heads in the sand when they don't have this evidence thrust in their
[40:38.700 --> 40:42.900]  face. But Alex, you know as well as I that there is a preponderance of evidence, that
[40:42.900 --> 40:47.460]  if anything, Benghazi is just the cherry on top of this, where they're saying, all right,
[40:47.460 --> 40:49.580]  here it is, we have this particular incident.
[40:49.580 --> 40:54.820]  But if you look to every crime committed by the American government, by the Obama administration,
[40:54.820 --> 41:00.160]  what they actually did in Benghazi is relatively insignificant compared to the bailouts and
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.780]  TARP and the ripoff of the American people at the behest of the banking class, at the
[41:04.780 --> 41:08.780]  behest of the military industrial complex, all of the wars that are started abroad, at
[41:08.780 --> 41:11.120]  the destruction of civil liberties here in America.
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.060]  And if you raise awareness, you got to take it one step further. And that's why we're
[41:15.060 --> 41:19.500]  doing what we're doing. That's so important about what you do with Infowars, how you encourage
[41:19.500 --> 41:22.980]  people to get involved, and of course, what we do with Adam versus the Man, inspiring
[41:22.980 --> 41:25.020]  people to assert their self-ownership.
[41:25.020 --> 41:30.500]  Sure, let me bring this up. They've gone from Bush six years ago lying and saying, we don't
[41:30.500 --> 41:34.300]  listen to Americans without warrants. And then when it came out, it was like, wow, this
[41:34.300 --> 41:36.300]  is illegal. They're gonna stop.
[41:36.300 --> 41:40.180]  Now you see that they're recording every phone call.
[41:40.180 --> 41:47.700]  That's what I was about to say. Now, Obama's New York Times on the verge of backing FBI
[41:47.700 --> 41:52.460]  plan to tap web users. They're already doing it. And they say preemptively, we're gonna
[41:52.460 --> 41:57.020]  tap everyone. And by the way, this is pointed at libertarians and returning veterans.
[41:57.020 --> 42:03.580]  This is an open group of criminals where I have the New York Times today going, yeah,
[42:03.580 --> 42:07.720]  we're listening to everything we're doing. US is weighing wide overhaul of wiretap laws.
[42:07.720 --> 42:11.940]  They call it overhaul. And they say, yeah, we're just gonna watch you in live time and
[42:11.940 --> 42:13.140]  use it in court.
[42:13.140 --> 42:19.380]  This is the revolution against the Bill of Rights and Constitution. I mean, this is by
[42:19.380 --> 42:25.280]  a bunch of crazy people wearing third world dictator uniforms. Let's shift gears. This
[42:25.280 --> 42:30.900]  police chief, we're gonna play a clip in a moment, of the District of Criminals, this
[42:30.900 --> 42:33.520]  Alien Incorporated criminal group.
[42:33.520 --> 42:37.020]  The Supreme Court said you can't keep people from having guns. Four years later, nobody
[42:37.020 --> 42:42.780]  can have guns. They just do what the Chicago ignores the Supreme Court, the lawless mafia.
[42:42.780 --> 42:48.900]  So I had an instinctive level. Get your courage to call for this, to go do this, to throw
[42:48.900 --> 42:55.220]  down the gauntlet, to overthrow their fraud politically with a major, major event like
[42:55.220 --> 42:56.220]  this.
[42:56.220 --> 42:59.320]  And you're gonna be nonviolent, peaceful. I get it all. And then to watch her looking
[42:59.320 --> 43:06.940]  like a witch out of a movie, snickering about how they'll be forced to arrest you with this
[43:06.940 --> 43:12.260]  craven look in her eyes. I can have the guns. I'm the government god. You can't be trusted.
[43:12.260 --> 43:13.780]  This is lawlessness.
[43:13.780 --> 43:19.160]  But then I get everybody else saying, hey, they're gonna spin this against us and they
[43:19.160 --> 43:26.060]  could provocateur. So understand, I admire what you're doing. But at the same time, I
[43:26.060 --> 43:30.860]  think it's very, very dangerous. I don't think it's really criticism for people to say danger
[43:30.860 --> 43:32.160]  Will Robinson.
[43:32.160 --> 43:35.760]  I think it's more important to have cameras there than guns. Do you see what I'm saying?
[43:35.760 --> 43:37.500]  So what do you wanna say to the witch?
[43:37.500 --> 43:41.820]  Well, absolutely. And I wanna say it's much more dangerous to sit at home. It's much more
[43:41.820 --> 43:46.180]  dangerous to stay asleep. It's much more dangerous to remain a victim of government. It's much
[43:46.180 --> 43:51.340]  more dangerous to spend Independence Day sitting around getting fat, watching fireworks, and
[43:51.340 --> 43:54.860]  patting yourself on the back for being part of this great country and doing nothing about
[43:54.860 --> 43:55.860]  it.
[43:55.860 --> 44:00.060]  So we have already scored a major victory with this. I think you can appreciate what
[44:00.060 --> 44:06.500]  we have done. Alex has provided this response from the chief of police who has made it clear
[44:06.500 --> 44:12.500]  that she is a criminal. That she intends to break the law on Independence Day. And she
[44:12.500 --> 44:18.140]  intends to violate the constitutional rights of fellow Americans despite the ruling from
[44:18.140 --> 44:19.500]  the Supreme Court.
[44:19.500 --> 44:24.700]  And I was a little reluctant to come on and discuss this today, as you know. And we have
[44:24.700 --> 44:29.060]  some particulars that we're gonna be announcing in the next few weeks about this march as
[44:29.060 --> 44:34.380]  it develops, as we see the support grow exponentially, as we see more and more law enforcement officers
[44:34.380 --> 44:38.420]  who are oath keepers rather than oath breakers sign on on our side.
[44:38.420 --> 44:43.540]  And they will be accompanying us and providing an escort. But I'm ready to tell the chief
[44:43.540 --> 44:48.700]  of police right here publicly that she's put herself in a lose-lose situation. And there
[44:48.700 --> 44:57.560]  are really only two possible outcomes for this to go non-violently as we strongly are
[44:57.560 --> 45:01.240]  working to ensure that that is the outcome of this, that it is non-violent.
[45:01.240 --> 45:05.420]  But there are really only two possibilities. And one is that she honors our request and
[45:05.420 --> 45:09.780]  provides us with an escort along our route and allows us to conduct our march around
[45:09.780 --> 45:11.820]  the Capitol, around the Supreme Court, around the White House.
[45:11.820 --> 45:16.480]  She has to allow you to eat the lunch counter. You're asking like Eisenhower. When people
[45:16.480 --> 45:20.260]  wouldn't let blacks go to school, you're asking her to actually protect the Bill of Rights
[45:20.260 --> 45:24.820]  and Constitution and to join you against treason. Is that what you're saying?
[45:24.820 --> 45:28.260]  Absolutely. But here's the other alternative, Alex. And this is what I'm calling on people
[45:28.260 --> 45:33.720]  to join us for now and why I'm asking people to RSVP specifically to this event on Facebook
[45:33.720 --> 45:37.020]  as the way that we are gonna count our numbers and make sure that we have the critical mass
[45:37.020 --> 45:38.620]  and the strength to do this.
[45:38.620 --> 45:43.220]  And it looks like we are already there, nearly 3,000 RSVP. This thing is really taking off.
[45:43.220 --> 45:47.340]  And I'm so grateful for everybody who's made this commitment to stand with me. But if she
[45:47.340 --> 45:52.940]  does not respect the rule of law, we will shut her down. And what I mean by that is
[45:52.940 --> 45:58.040]  we will overwhelm them with people engaging in civil disobedience on this day, willing
[45:58.040 --> 46:02.740]  to risk arrest either through crossing that line, carrying a loaded firearm, or within
[46:02.740 --> 46:06.860]  the District of Columbia doing whatever it takes to say that we will not be silent.
[46:06.860 --> 46:11.220]  We will not just obey. We will not go silently into the night. We will stand up. We will
[46:11.220 --> 46:16.260]  fight. We will disobey unjust laws. And we will make the enforcement of unconstitutional
[46:16.260 --> 46:22.660]  regulations untenable for law enforcement.
[46:22.660 --> 46:26.500]  Well so now I know why you're reticent to break this here. I didn't know that you were
[46:26.500 --> 46:32.660]  gonna double down and say, I guess like the end of V for Vendetta. Can you guys look on
[46:32.660 --> 46:37.020]  YouTube and find the final scene or the end of V for Vendetta when people all put the
[46:37.020 --> 46:42.740]  mask on and go through the soldiers? Because even if they fire like Tiananmen Square, they
[46:42.740 --> 46:43.740]  will lose.
[46:43.740 --> 46:48.780]  This will not go like China. Is this what you were really planning, Adam?
[46:48.780 --> 46:55.260]  I was not planning on getting such an immediate response from the police department, but I
[46:55.260 --> 47:01.580]  was planning on standing by my principles and sticking to my guns, so to speak. We fully
[47:01.580 --> 47:06.260]  intend to do that. And even if it's just me by myself crossing that line getting arrested,
[47:06.260 --> 47:10.860]  we will give the Second Amendment and the constitutional the ultimate test this Independence
[47:10.860 --> 47:11.860]  Day.
[47:11.860 --> 47:20.960]  Well, there's no doubt the government is totally and completely out of control on every front.
[47:20.960 --> 47:27.500]  Right now, by the way, they've even cut the Benghazi hearing off C-SPAN 1 to 2 to 3. And
[47:27.500 --> 47:31.540]  they're talking about not even having the hearing now. This is a total meltdown. You've
[47:31.540 --> 47:38.960]  got congressmen saying death is part of life. We've got them admitting there was a stand
[47:38.960 --> 47:40.740]  down ordered.
[47:40.740 --> 47:50.740]  This is unbelievable. The history that we're seeing unfold right now here on air. I mean,
[47:50.740 --> 47:56.500]  I just have trouble even being on air when such historical things happening. A mother
[47:56.500 --> 48:00.500]  of one of the dead is saying that she blames Hillary. Hillary's in the spotlight. Remember
[48:00.500 --> 48:06.020]  her throwing a fit and saying what difference does it make like a baby, just showing her
[48:06.020 --> 48:07.620]  bravada.
[48:07.620 --> 48:11.540]  Remember her saying that? I mean, this is unprecedented. We've got live coverage at
[48:11.540 --> 48:22.140]  info wars.com. And we've also got live coverage going on right now that we're seeing at drudgereport.com.
[48:22.140 --> 48:27.180]  And there's a major study out that I just mentioned. Gun crime has plunged, but Americans
[48:27.180 --> 48:32.820]  think it's up. So the LA Times actually just kind of redid the article that I was just
[48:32.820 --> 48:43.100]  mentioning earlier that Zero Hedge covered, actually showing the statistics. Unbelievable,
[48:43.100 --> 48:44.760]  more guns, less crime.
[48:44.760 --> 48:54.540]  That's what Professor Lot's info has shown. 59%, no, no, I'm sorry, 69% drop in actual
[48:54.540 --> 49:02.540]  shootings, 49% drop in violent crime, but only 12% of Americans believe gun crime has
[49:02.540 --> 49:09.420]  fallen. And by the way, this is from fbi.gov in the Justice Department. They now have the
[49:09.420 --> 49:15.020]  official report out. So you see, I've been saying with our statisticians, 49% drop in
[49:15.020 --> 49:16.020]  violent crime.
[49:16.020 --> 49:20.420]  Alex, this is a lot bigger than the firearms issue and the Second Amendment. This is about
[49:20.420 --> 49:24.000]  the people's fundamental relationship to government and whether we're gonna be obedient
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.900]  wage slaves or whether we're gonna be free sovereign individuals. And I wanna make clear
[49:27.900 --> 49:32.180]  exactly what I'm facing and what I'm calling on people to do if they join me. I'm gonna
[49:32.180 --> 49:37.380]  be facing a felony charge that includes a sentence of up to five years and $5,000 in
[49:37.380 --> 49:38.380]  fines.
[49:38.380 --> 49:41.660]  And I'm willing to take that risk. I'm willing to face that and force the court case in order
[49:41.660 --> 49:45.780]  to force the issue and give the Second Amendment the ultimate test in my particular act of
[49:45.780 --> 49:49.620]  civil disobedience that day. If that's how it goes down, it's gonna be very peaceful,
[49:49.620 --> 49:54.700]  very controlled. We are gonna send people one at a time who are volunteering to be arrested
[49:54.700 --> 49:57.060]  on the same charge who wanna join me.
[49:57.060 --> 50:01.600]  But broader than that now, that this is the threat that they have declared the District
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.880]  of Columbia a Constitution-free zone. We are calling for everybody who would like to join
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.500]  us in civil disobedience that day to swarm the Capitol, to overwhelm the law enforcement,
[50:10.500 --> 50:14.480]  to make it clear that if they're not even gonna respect our silly little rules, we will
[50:14.480 --> 50:17.260]  make their job impossible.
[50:17.260 --> 50:21.200]  You don't have to bring a gun. In fact, you can come to our event unarmed. We highly suggest
[50:21.200 --> 50:24.940]  coming with a camera. We wanna make sure that this is documented and everybody involved
[50:24.940 --> 50:29.020]  is held fully accountable. But if you wanna go into the district unarmed, if you wanna
[50:29.020 --> 50:32.740]  go in with a camera, if you wanna commit another act of civil disobedience, I can think of
[50:32.740 --> 50:33.740]  no better way-
[50:33.740 --> 50:36.820]  Yeah, cuz by the way, they get in your face there. I mean, you could be at the park with
[50:36.820 --> 50:41.380]  a camera. They walk over to families and want you to know you're in North Korea. I mean,
[50:41.380 --> 50:45.380]  you live there. That's why you know how hellish it is. I mean, the government runs around
[50:45.380 --> 50:50.580]  on power trips foaming at the mouth with the same look in their eyes North Korean despots
[50:50.580 --> 50:56.820]  have. It is a spirit of disgusting filth. And right now, Benghazi is burning them down.
[50:56.820 --> 51:00.860]  We'll be right back with Adam Kokesh and the police chief in a monkey outfit.

[52:05.180 --> 52:10.220]  2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[52:10.220 --> 52:14.740]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think
[52:14.740 --> 52:18.860]  out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you
[52:18.860 --> 52:24.060]  are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to
[52:24.060 --> 52:28.580]  control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and
[52:28.580 --> 52:33.060]  availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with

[53:04.780 --> 53:08.940]  than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while
[53:08.940 --> 53:13.880]  you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments and
[53:13.880 --> 53:20.620]  sells for less than $30? Yes, it's fake TV. This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes
[53:20.620 --> 53:25.140]  will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that
[53:25.140 --> 53:30.540]  looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look
[53:30.540 --> 53:36.580]  like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. Fake TV could be
[53:36.580 --> 53:41.380]  the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. To get
[53:41.380 --> 53:50.700]  your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's
[53:50.700 --> 54:00.700]  1-877-532-5388 or go to Faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[54:20.700 --> 54:36.180]  Ladies and... Kathy Lanier, the police chief of the alien district of criminals that believe
[54:36.180 --> 54:43.180]  it's above the law. Imagine the Supreme Court said four years ago, your laws are all unconstitutional.
[54:43.180 --> 54:47.940]  They're still all in place. They say if you jump through 45,000 flaming hoops on a blue
[54:47.940 --> 54:54.300]  moon when the Easter Bunny sacrifices nine children to the goblin god, then maybe you
[54:54.300 --> 55:00.740]  can have a gun permit if the criminals want to give it to you. And you see a 49% drop
[55:00.740 --> 55:06.860]  in violent crime, a 69% drop in survived shootings. That's the headline. I've got all the statistics
[55:06.860 --> 55:12.960]  here. LA Times is running with a 39% drop in gun crime, but that's just one little thing
[55:12.960 --> 55:19.040]  they snip it out. It's well over 50. And that's all in the firearm violence report.
[55:19.040 --> 55:22.420]  Adam Kokesh is our guest and you see her. Let's play a clip of her and then get Adam
[55:22.420 --> 55:27.620]  Kokesh's take on this and then I'm going Benghazi. I know Katherine Albrecht's coming on. I wanted
[55:27.620 --> 55:30.980]  to get her on about Google censoring people and stuff. Let's get her on at the next half
[55:30.980 --> 55:35.180]  hour cuz of Benghazi breaking news. If not, we can do her next week. Get her on the show
[55:35.180 --> 55:36.700]  next week.
[55:36.700 --> 55:44.660]  Let's go ahead and go to a woman in a costume acting powerful. She gets a gun you don't
[55:44.660 --> 55:50.160]  slave. That's what this is. Here it is. Chief, what can you tell us about the man? I don't
[55:50.160 --> 55:56.960]  actually know where he lives, but he's an internet radio talk show host. And he says,
[55:56.960 --> 55:59.340]  we need to push back against the government a bit.
[55:59.340 --> 56:04.700]  And the way to do that is to take some armed guns, rifles, what have you, put them on our
[56:04.700 --> 56:10.900]  backs and march across Memorial bridge on July 4th. Will they be allowed into the city?
[56:10.900 --> 56:14.900]  Well, first of all, I want to clear up a, there's a difference between civil disobedience,
[56:14.900 --> 56:19.180]  which I think is this is being portrayed as a civil disobedience and actually violation
[56:19.180 --> 56:22.880]  of the law. I mean, there's two different things here. So civil disobedience, people
[56:22.880 --> 56:28.020]  come to Washington DC to, to protest policies and government policy. You arrest them all
[56:28.020 --> 56:32.760]  the time. But when you, no problem with you with firearms and you're not in compliance
[56:32.760 --> 56:35.900]  with the law, now you're talking about a criminal offense and there's, you know, there's going
[56:35.900 --> 56:40.600]  to be some action by police. So obviously we have not, there's no permit that has been
[56:40.600 --> 56:45.660]  filed by the organizer. We contact directly with the organizer yet, but we will, and we'll
[56:45.660 --> 56:48.620]  make sure that they understand that if they want to pass through the district of Columbia
[56:48.620 --> 56:53.320]  with firearms, as long as they're in compliance with the firearms laws for transportation
[56:53.320 --> 56:57.480]  of firearms to the district, we're all for it. But passing into the district of Columbia
[56:57.480 --> 57:00.640]  with loaded firearms is a violation of law and we'll have to treat it as such. Here's
[57:00.640 --> 57:06.320]  what Adam Kokash told the listeners on his internet program a short time ago. Oh, how
[57:06.320 --> 57:13.080]  evil. I think it's time we stand up in critical mass and say, no, we're not just going to
[57:13.080 --> 57:21.040]  cower before your tyranny, Washington. We are not simply going to bend over and take
[57:21.040 --> 57:28.480]  it from the district of criminals. We are going to March. And I asked today to the Adam
[57:28.480 --> 57:38.280]  versus the man audience. I asked if I were to go on an illegal, not unlawful.
[57:38.280 --> 57:43.840]  Let's go back to Adam here. Look, look, the issue here is they have ruled their laws are
[57:43.840 --> 57:48.720]  illegal. And so she says she's going to violate our civil rights, but she gets to have a gun.
[57:48.720 --> 57:53.240]  She gets to have bodyguards. She gets to sit up there and play the part of God. Well, this
[57:53.240 --> 57:58.880]  is an illegitimate government that says our military is under NATO UN rule. Okay. America
[57:58.880 --> 58:03.600]  has been hijacked. These people, I don't care. Notice the uniforms get bigger. The stars
[58:03.600 --> 58:08.400]  get bigger. The outfits get bigger. The red carpets get bigger. The more illegitimate
[58:08.400 --> 58:14.120]  they are in Mexico, in North Korea, we are not North Korea, which what do you say to
[58:14.120 --> 58:15.800]  her going out to break Adam?
[58:15.800 --> 58:20.620]  I think it's really disgusting that an officer allegedly of the law doesn't understand what
[58:20.620 --> 58:25.760]  civil disobedience is. We are intending to break what we consider to be an unjust law
[58:25.760 --> 58:27.680]  because it is contrary to the natural law.
[58:27.680 --> 58:33.860]  Next, you're going to tell me black shouldn't have gone and sat in at the, uh, the places
[58:33.860 --> 58:43.040]  to eat. You're an extremist. How dare you do this? How dare you?
[58:43.040 --> 58:50.960]  This is GCN, the Genesis communications radio network

[59:53.360 --> 01:00:05.160]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:12.160]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:30.920]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:37.800]  Well Elijah Cummings is whitewashing Benghazi saying death is part of life. So don't make
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:44.520]  a big deal out of it, buddy. See, they're going to decide when a death is important.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.080]  Kill a million plus Iraqis? It's a good price to pay for security in the Gulf. Madeleine
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.920]  Albright. At that time it was a half million, now it's a million and a half, so she was
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.360]  very proud of that then and she's proud of it now. And when they say it's a good price
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.280]  to pay, take all your liberties, so they're secure in their criminal activities.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.160]  So like death's part of life, big deal, ambassador dead. And the government's like, this is one
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:13.400]  of our own. Now you get it, you're all expendable morons until you have a Bill of Rights, a
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.480]  constitution that's enforced. Adam, I've been ranting a lot, Adam versus the man, people
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480]  just joined us.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:26.000]  He's planning the armed peaceful march on DC. A civil rights march like going and sitting
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.720]  at the front of the bus or going into the lunch counter and demanding you be served.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.240]  And of course, I was being sarcastic telling him, how dare you? I get why people are so
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:40.120]  timid. If people are freaked out by me going on Redcoats show and going, you want our guns,
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.760]  it's gonna cause a civil war, back off.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:48.400]  If so-called conservatives and libertarians literally defecated in their pants over that,
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.040]  what you're doing is like a nuclear bomb going off compared to that. So again, I get your
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.560]  right to do it. I get they can come against us and do all sorts of stuff. In my gut, I
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:05.240]  probably wouldn't have done it. I'm not saying you're bad, I'm saying my view, my opinion.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.760]  But now that it's going, now that it's happening, Adam, we need to make sure there's cameras
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.480]  there and make sure you get as much support so this doesn't get co-opted by the enemy.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.480]  Go ahead.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.640]  Absolutely, Alex. Well, I'd like to extend a personal invitation to you and to everyone
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.020]  in your audience, but really to you in particular for this day. I can't imagine a better way
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:27.760]  to spend Independence Day than engaged in something as important as civil disobedience.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.080]  And you don't have to bring a gun. You don't have to be a part of my event. But if you
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.720]  could be there on Independence Day to document it, it would be greatly appreciated. But if
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.720]  you could engage in some civil disobedience and say that you are willing to put your concept
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.360]  of what the Constitution should be above what the law enforcement officers believe it is.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.360]  The gods, no, no, no, no, no, the officials, call them gods.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.800]  Excuse me, the officials. Alex, I invite you to get arrested with me on Independence Day
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.360]  in Washington, D.C. Well, know what they'll do. This is what they've done to like peaceful
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.880]  demonstrators in Austin and in Minneapolis, St. Paul, everywhere else. They'll just the
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:08.460]  night before put pipe bombs in your apartment or Moloch cocktails. So so just you should
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.680]  say up front, you don't have any Moloch cocktails. I don't. And there are too many of us for
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.320]  them to try that this time. Alex, we are storming the Capitol.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:22.020]  Well, I've stormed the Texas Capitol and they actually you have they stood down because
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.860]  they didn't want us to have the victory. Look at the opt out a few years ago on the groping.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.640]  They just shut the whole thing down for a week. They didn't want us to have that victory.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:35.140]  They didn't want to. In fact, they should have in the south, the racist restaurant owners,
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.900]  they should have just said, OK, today you can eat.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:44.240]  But then tomorrow you can't. You understand? Then you would have never gotten that freedom.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.400]  This is the time to push. What do you want to say to her? I mean, I hate to chew into
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:55.080]  her, but she just looks like a goon in with now. I mean, she looks worse than like a,
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.560]  you know, a Guatemalan general or something. I mean, this is a joke.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.300]  I feel sorry for her, Alex, that she's been called out at this point and identified as
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.400]  someone who doesn't care about the Constitution, who would rather be a lackey of politicians
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.660]  than stand up for the people. And if you talk about the effect on the District of Columbia,
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:16.260]  the murder capital of the world, the country, if not the world, you see that the effect
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:21.420]  of their policies has been incredibly destructive. It has been a great boon for poverty and for
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.420]  crime.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.820]  And I think, if anything, it's time for the American people to recognize that when the
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:29.820]  government has these kinds of overbearing policies, there are real consequences. This
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:34.300]  is a very simple, easy way, relatively speaking, compared to what prior generations were called
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.620]  on to do in the struggle to stand up for what we believe in, to stand up for a living.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.860]  You know, I think you're an extremist. How dare you make fun of her costume? I think
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:45.360]  she should start wearing a Queen Elizabeth crown. It would certainly be appropriate.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.160]  But there's something bigger going on here, Alex, and you understand this. And I really
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.060]  do hope to have you there on Independence Day and so many of your audiences.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:57.460]  No, no, I get this is epic. I know you're doing it. So I'm not going to sit here like
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.420]  a coward to say you're a bad guy.

[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:13.660]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:40.580]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:48.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, Gregory Hicks, the deputy head of counterterrorism for the State Department
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:53.100]  has come out and basically confirmed everything we already knew. But I expected because of
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:58.380]  threats and other whistleblowers being gagged that he was gonna say, they just screwed up.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.780]  They're really idiots. He said, no, they lied. They had C-130s with gunships with Gatling
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:09.380]  guns and howitzers. They had drones, armed drones. We were down the road with armored
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:13.320]  vehicles. We were not given an escort. No one was allowed to protect them. There was
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:20.040]  a stand down. They are lying. And that's why the head of CENTCOM got removed moved being
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.660]  so upset about it.
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:25.380]  The head of CENTCOM before that Fox Fallon got removed because he refused to stage an
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:31.860]  attack on our own ships to blame Iran. We have a group of lawless criminals in government
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:35.140]  and they're able to steal your pension funds. They're able to butcher the Bill of Rights
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:40.740]  and Constitution, but they can't get everything because the military and the police are not
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:44.540]  complete criminals.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:58.940]  Now, this just goes on and on and on and on. And it's on every front. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:04.640]  they're stealing $85 million a month out of one tax window. And they won't tell Congress
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:10.500]  where it goes. Then the companies brag to their shareholders that it's going to foreign
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.260]  multinational banks.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:18.700]  And JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs here in America and Wells Fargo and Wachovia and you know
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:26.740]  who owns the controls that, Berkshire Hathaway. He got $44 plus billion in 2008 of taxpayer
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:31.460]  money and it's happened every year since. Now do you know why the police are wearing
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:37.180]  black uniforms? Now do you know why there's cameras? They've robbed everything.
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:42.620]  And I gotta say this is historical to be watching this hearing and seeing these people testify
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:47.980]  shaking and going, they're lying. They knew and they stood down. I just got chills, big
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.340]  ones. Now, John Bounds been watching this. We've been watching it. We're giving you all
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.740]  the, I got goosebumps right here.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.140]  I got goosebumps.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:01.540]  Yeah, as I was leaving, we're still right in the middle. But as I was leaving, they were going
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:06.900]  through Hillary Clinton's cables and seeing whether or not she was involved with the-
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.460]  By leaving, when you walked out of your office next door in there.
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:17.140]  And so the last statement by Representative Gowdy, he was talking about the fact that
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:21.700]  a classified email has come out and he read it for the first time that-
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:26.580]  So they're now going all the way, releasing classified stuff in Congress. No wonder all
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.820]  the channels tuned away. Guys, check, is Fox carrying this?
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:35.180]  It's all over. Well, it's the main station.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.500]  Seeing an end cut to a package from last night with CIA Cooper on gangs.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:43.900]  Oh, sure. They're probably using the whole debacle with the girls that were taken and
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:49.740]  all that as a diversion. But anyway, it's not diverting us. Gowdy came out with the
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:58.020]  information that the Libyan Department there was saying the day after in an email to the
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.020]  State Department.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.020]  Well, that was in the news.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.940]  That it was a terrorist attack. Well, he just read that.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.220]  And Fox is carrying it. The other channels have cut away, at least last time I checked.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.500]  And so Rice has a lot to answer for. And of course, it's gonna lead right up to Hillary
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:13.940]  Clinton. And it should take a lot of people down if we can get all the truth out.
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:20.780]  Well, I mean, look, if the whole truth comes out, look, they had high def video feeds in
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:28.980]  infrared of every, they could zoom in on birthmarks on people, okay? I mean, they had less than
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:36.500]  a mile away a giant CIA base full of Navy SEALs and CIA commandos after their SEALs.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.020]  And only two guys refused to stand down and ran and drove over there and fought them off.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:47.620]  Well, I think the most telling statement is General Martin Dempsey's to Senator Iote of
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:52.700]  New Hampshire. He says, we couldn't do it because it was the middle of the night.
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:53.700]  And-
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.700]  Everybody knows the Pentagon doesn't fight at night.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:55.700]  These aircraft-
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.700]  They only fight at night.
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:01.900]  They were on strip alert and they were a part of a commitment to NATO and Europe, not America,
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:06.220]  not our embassy, our American embassy. They're on a commitment to-
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.860]  No, no, no, no, I'm explaining something. In fact, this is the key. This is what nobody,
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:13.540]  this is the angle no one's covering, and this is the key angle. You had three hearings last
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:18.940]  year where the Joint Chiefs read letters from Obama saying, not to Congress, to NATO, saying
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:23.420]  I stand by for NATO orders, I am under NATO.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:28.500]  That's worse than Hitler saying I'm the dictator of Germany, at least he was German. This is
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.700]  a guy who's got all these multiple names, Barry Sotero, all this, we don't know who
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:37.940]  he is. I mean, he did have the name Barry Sotero. Okay, they sealed all his records
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.940]  and he says, in public letters, we've written the articles, we've played the clips, we need
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:47.380]  this as a package tonight, showing when they said, we are under NATO and the UN, and now
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.860]  it's come out here.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:54.860]  They stood down because, see how that's perfect? The White House is like, sorry, CENTCOM head,
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:14:00.100]  you can't hate them. Our hard security force is taking him out for whatever reason. NATO
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.700]  isn't answering the telephone.
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:02.700]  Yeah, this is-
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:03.700]  So our press-
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.300]  This is NATO's backyard, and Panetta's over there saying that there's no way they could
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:10.220]  have gotten to it. So they're just going with whatever NATO-
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:14.860]  They just had an aircraft carrier 100 miles away, and C-130s 30 miles away, and predators
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.820]  20,000 feet in the air.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:21.900]  They also had another group that was going there, and they were told to stay, to not
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:26.980]  get on the plane. And they would have made it just before the attack happened, the laser
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:32.420]  pointed attack. I mean, the way that Hicks talks about it is that the way they were attacked
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.300]  was with incredible accuracy.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:40.100]  Oh, no, no, that came out a week into it that they knew internal secret procedures. And
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:46.300]  that's why Colonel Shaffer came on and said it was clearly a hit with inside knowledge.
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:51.740]  And I said, you're saying Obama did it? And off air, he's like, affirmative, affirmative.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:55.380]  And then he's like, well, no, no, I'm getting a lot of heat. I didn't mean that. So maybe
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:15:00.100]  I misunderstood the Colonel, who everything he told me has now come true.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.980]  And by the way, I know Shaffer's not coming on cuz they're threatening him. I want Shaffer
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:10.740]  on Tony Shaffer now, okay? Cuz he has the intel, he said all this a week after it happened.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.940]  Yeah, I'd like to see what Pacenik has to say about this.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.420]  He's on Fox News, I know, but he needs to go out and say this on Fox News. Okay, next
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:20.660]  week, get him. He's a good guy, man, I tell you, we know what they did. Why do you think
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.620]  they killed him? Because they were transferring the heat seekers there at that, but we know
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.380]  they were giving them the heat seekers there.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.800]  An old warehouse full of heat seeking missiles. Yeah, that's probably part of it.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.500]  And obviously, they can't start shooting the airliners down and declare martial law when
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.620]  it comes out. The globalist gave Al-Qaeda the heat seekers.
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.220]  Not to mention all the documentation that was destroyed.
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:42.780]  Recap everything you just said. I'm sorry, Catherine Alberts, I said move her to the
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:48.300]  30. Let's get her on for ten minutes about Google, get her on next week for a full hour,
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:52.900]  is it so important. And Jeffrey Smith, we'll get a ten minute update on him on the march
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:57.260]  on Monsanto, cuz it is important, but I've gotta take calls and cover this.
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:02.340]  Recap everything you just saw. What it comes down to is that we've got a side of NATO,
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.060]  which includes our State Department and our President-
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:11.220]  That's running Al-Qaeda in Syria. Yeah, that is in on this attack. And then the attack
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:16.740]  happens and the people in charge that are just doing their jobs as American citizens,
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:23.180]  basically working for America, are there begging for help to arrive.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:28.260]  There are all these answers given to them how they can't arrive. They can't send troops.
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:32.620]  They're two hours away, they'll never make it. We can't send a fighter jet over.
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.860]  And then six hours later, everybody's dead, eight hours.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.020]  Everyone's dead and all the evidence is destroyed because-
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.900]  I'll tell you though, it's a good test though. They had a base with hundreds of commandos
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.980]  down the street and they followed orders. Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.980]  Hey, you think your pension funds are safe, commandos and CIA people. You really wanna
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:55.220]  let crooks like this run wild, who think we're so stupid. I'm sorry, go ahead, recap the
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.220]  other points.
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.980]  Well, I can't wait to get in there and see what else is going on because now they're
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:04.660]  going after Hillary Clinton. And they're seeing if she's linked up to these cables, to these
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.940]  emails. She's ahead of the state- She's in command.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:11.480]  She's totally in command. How is she? She's taking a week off?
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.020]  Why did they want the ambassador dead? Why did they use, it's on record, this is the
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:21.340]  security group is who killed them. Their hired security is who killed them.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:26.700]  There's some interior motive with the United Nations and Qaddafi and the evidence and the
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:30.020]  money. No, that's it, it's a Sarkozy, he gave a billion
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.860]  bucks to Sarkozy, reportedly. Yeah.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:36.100]  Get me Wayne Madsen today, get me Wayne Madsen right now.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:39.900]  Well, we'll put all this together in a cogent report for tonight.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:45.340]  Man, I'm telling you, this is, cuz listen, I gotta admit, I'm rarely wrong. And again,
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:50.240]  John Bounds, a long time news reporter, syndicated radio, a reporter in his own right, comes
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.620]  from a long journalistic background. But your dad wanted Peabody, didn't he?
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:56.220]  Yes, he did. I'm just bragging about you. Anyways, the
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:02.140]  point is, have you ever, I mean, I'm rarely wrong around here. I mean, I'm usually right,
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:05.260]  but I gotta say, I'm wrong about this. I was like, it's gonna be a whitewash that there
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.220]  was internal failures and they screwed up, they need more funding.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:12.780]  No, this is guy shaking going, they knew, they stood down, they killed everybody. I
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:18.280]  mean, they all know it was a hit. Their security force went and murdered them. And this is
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.140]  now on television. How are they gonna spin this John Brown?
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:28.140]  Well, it's completely ludicrous because the very next day he sees, or a few days later,
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:36.340]  he sees Rice come out on the news on various shows saying that it was a group of people
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:39.960]  that were angry about an Islamic film that was made when-
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.180]  And it turns out that was produced by the FBI.
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:48.380]  Right, that had nothing to do with it because there was no protest at the embassy.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:53.700]  No, the media hyping it caused a few goodies where the Muslims killed Christians in Egypt.
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:57.500]  So it's just a big cover up. There's a huge amount of information-
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:01.900]  They tried to start Muslim riots everywhere the week after to cover this up.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:06.180]  Yeah, and yeah. Which was a false flag. I mean, to go, look,
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:11.660]  Arabs, get mad, it's good, Muslims, burn everything. Look, we're saying Mohammed is a, you know,
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:16.980]  you know, pilfering goats or whatever. And so they put this out, they covered, that's
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:21.220]  a false flag. They always run a false flag to cover up. Let me tell you, we're, I'm gonna
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:27.020]  say this right now, we are in prime danger for them to blow plants sky high, mass shootings
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.020]  today the next day.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.740]  I mean, I'm telling you right now, they probably, the globalists have probably got-
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:34.860]  They're on red alert. They're loading trucks with bombs right now.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.300]  Yeah, they're covering something up that is so massive that we're gonna start digging
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.300]  into not just-
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:44.220]  No, no, they've gotta, watch them. I'm telling you, they could set a nuke off and say Syria
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:49.900]  did it. They are gonna pull something big right now. That just hit me. Danger Will Robinson.
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:56.460]  I bet that, I bet, I mean, to use the analogy of a missile, it's lifting off right now.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:00.740]  They're launching a false flag right now. You can set your watch and warrant.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:06.220]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:11.460]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:15.740]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:20.700]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:25.540]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:30.740]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:20.780]  I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grade. And though the news
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.780]  was rather sad.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.500]  Would typically be the distribution for that.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.320]  Okay. Thank you much. I was inspired.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.520]  I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Tierney, you're recognized.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:36.760]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hicks, let me start by acknowledging how riveting your testimony
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.380]  was of the events of that day and evening and thanking you for your service and your
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:45.180]  activity, for sharing with us all the brave acts that occurred that night. I don't think
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.440]  we've heard enough of that. And I think it's important for the American people to know
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:54.460]  how many individuals both in Tripoli and Libya responded so very well and bravely on that.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.300]  So thank you for sharing that and for your service as well.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:01.780]  All right. Again, that's more of the hearing. The thank you for this service. Thank you
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:05.500]  for that service. We've got teams watching it all, giving you the latest in the live
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:12.300]  feed update at mfallwars.com. By the way, Colonel Shafer could come on today, but they
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:18.060]  thought because I had other guests who I'm now canceling or moving, that he couldn't
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.060]  come on.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.620]  So it looks like Colonel Shafer will probably be on sometime in the next two hours. He's
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:28.940]  live on Fox right now, but he's got the real insight on all this cuz he ran a bunch of
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:34.700]  the secret operations like Stratus IV and others that were deeply involved tracking
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:40.280]  Al-Qaeda who basically work for NATO. See NATO is the big narcotics trafficking group
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.160]  under Bilderberg and it's used to do stuff the Pentagon isn't involved in kind of on
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.660]  white side operations.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.420]  And notice that's why they're now saying our military is under NATO. I mean, this is such
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:56.780]  a big deal. This is the globalist takeover of America. And if they can get away with
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:01.900]  this, they can get away with anything. John Bowne, what is the latest as we call out the
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.980]  most important intel from these historic hearings?
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:11.860]  Again, I was incorrect. I thought this would be a whitewash. This is meltdown level perjury,
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:18.420]  lying, a stand down and lying about the stand down is impeachable felony, but everything's
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:23.280]  impeachable. But this is so blaring. And again, the Republicans are involved in so many other
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.180]  crimes that they can't ever go after Obama on globalist issues of shutting down power
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:31.160]  plants and stuff like that, because they're involved in it too.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:35.240]  But something like this, I mean, and again, I don't even know if Obama was involved. I'm
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.240]  not whitewashing it for Obama. He's a teleprompter reader. But Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton,
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.860]  this is really their third term. They are in there running things. And that witch is
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.620]  definitely lying to people. And she's been caught lying. John Bowne, what's the latest?
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:55.500]  She is an actual witch, by the way. Yeah, right now it's Nordstrom is on the hot seat.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:01.620]  And he is talking about the complete lack of proactive leadership in the State Department,
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:02.620]  which-
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:03.620]  That's a whitewash.
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.220]  And well, but he's also saying that there's no way that Hillary Clinton didn't know because
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:12.260]  she's in charge of the entire operation. So the more these emails come out, the more it
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.100]  shows that she was completely in command.
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.980]  You mean Hillary Clinton is lying?
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:16.980]  Of the stand down.
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:17.980]  Come on, Hillary lied?
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:25.660]  She is, it's a dirty game she plays. But what we're gonna find out here probably within
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:33.620]  the next hour or so is that Hillary Clinton is completely responsible for the stand down.
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:39.820]  She's in cahoots with NATO to make sure that stand down happened, probably serving her
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.460]  masters there at the United Nations.
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:44.900]  Yeah, I mean, we know they ordered the killing of this guy. This was the security force,
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:49.220]  they pay al-Qaeda jihadi leaders, and they send them in to wipe them out.
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:53.460]  And then they send Rice out, the spokesperson of the United Nations, to tell the American
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:58.340]  people that we have nothing to, don't look over here because there's nothing to look
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:59.340]  at.
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:03.140]  Yeah, people with artillery and rocket launchers over eight hours who had precision understanding
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:05.900]  of security and pinpoint striking.
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.380]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:13.300]  I mean, this is a globalist attack on that ambassador. Maybe the ambassador was a good
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:18.100]  guy and said we're not gonna take down Syria and give 10,000 heat seeking missiles to al-Qaeda.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:22.580]  Maybe he had a heart. I mean, we don't know. Cuz we know they gave them the time after
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:24.260]  they killed him to get the weapons out.
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.260]  Mm-hm.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.660]  I mean, I think that's probably what went on.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:30.580]  Yeah, they destroyed all the evidence and for some reason the security detail that even
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:35.660]  just drives the trucks, they weren't even there. So the guy that got out, Hicks, the
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:40.900]  guy that got out, him and his crew that were destroying all the evidence, they had to drive
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:41.900]  those trucks.
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:46.300]  They didn't even know how to drive them. So they didn't even have the people there to
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.300]  do that.
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:51.380]  And they were calling on bases down the street to help them. And I'm sorry, NATO. NATO's not
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.900]  answering the phone right now.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:53.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.660]  And Hillary's taking a bubble bath. No, I mean, Hillary was in the Situation Room going,
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:59.660]  stand down, continue.
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:04.540]  Stand down, get to AFRICOM, let them know it's complete stand down.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.780]  Yeah, and that's on record. They told AFRICOM stand down, all of it.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:11.260]  Yep, they're on a plane headed to help them out. They would have made it.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:16.340]  Nixon had to leave office for lying about a break in to get psychology records. Obama
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:19.820]  is in the New York Times saying, we're spying on all of you without warrants now.
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820]  Yeah.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.820]  So that's okay too.
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:22.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:28.020]  Nixon was thrown out for spying on his competition and now the government's spying on all of
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.380]  us.
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:34.340]  And he was thrown out for having medical records and IRS records. Now they give them to all
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:35.340]  the agencies.
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:38.580]  Yeah, and now they're pushing Obama's back.
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:43.260]  And now they send Al-Qaeda to kill an ambassador of Navy Seals.
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:45.780]  Total corruption, total mafia is taking over.
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:49.900]  I'm going to take calls. I'm going to take calls. We'll get the number when we come back.

[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.860]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:15.460]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:40.740]  Don't tread on me.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:41.740]  Don't tread on me.
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:53.060]  You really want to cross that line? Don't tread on us, we're sick of being treaded on.
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:56.620]  You may have the zombies out there wanting to be tread upon, telling gun owners it's
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:05.140]  our fault people get shot when violent crimes down 49% and shooting. This is from the Firearms
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:10.980]  Violence 1993-2011 Justice Department report out today, even the LA Times was forced to
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:13.100]  report on it.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:16.420]  They're trying to spin it, though, like it's a case for gun control. There's more guns,
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:22.140]  more gun ownership, more concealed carry. Criminals are scared. Criminals now go and
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:25.980]  beg on the street corner. They know they'll get their butt blown off going in most people's
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:30.780]  houses. Come in my office, we're not gonna get in fetal positions for a mass shooting.
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:35.580]  You're gonna get shot. It's like attacking a police station in Texas. You go in the average
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.940]  person's business or house.
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:44.020]  I got a construction crew right here. I know Fullwell's packing heat. Good. A criminal
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:48.420]  that wants to come kill you folks is coming. The only way to stop them is that you're armed.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:52.500]  That's the only way to equalize things, not take all the guns. I won't have them, you
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.060]  won't have them, right? Then they're going to have them.
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:59.500]  I'm gonna get more into that in the next hour. Let me give you the toll free number to join
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:06.720]  us. It's 800-259-9231. But let me add something, we don't screen calls here. Except when I
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.940]  say it's on a subject and it's on one thing.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:14.900]  Are you watching these Benghazi hearings? Do you realize how big this is? Cuz I'm right
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:23.140]  about, let's be honest, 95% of the time. I mean, I do my research. I know what I'm talking
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:26.880]  about. That's been proven. And I'm not proud of that either. I'm saying we know what we're
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:27.880]  talking about.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:33.060]  When I'm wrong, I will tell you I'm wrong. These people's body language is they're feeling
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:36.020]  good. They're doing the right thing. They're scared. They know they're coming after them.
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:39.260]  They're coming after their families. They may even get arrested for testifying, but
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:41.140]  they're going all the way.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:44.580]  Some of these people were basically told they couldn't talk about what they're talking about.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:51.520]  You're seeing national security orders being broken right now. Fake national security orders.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:56.820]  I talked to Colonel Shafers and come on tomorrow. We're lining that up. He's in critical meetings.
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:01.400]  This is historical, okay? And Shafers in the middle of all this. He's a whistleblower. Ladies
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.400]  and gentlemen on exposing Al-Qaeda working for the globalist. Just like Cebel Edmonds
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:12.340]  said, there's a group in NATO and a group in CIA above the Pentagon, Justice Pachanik
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:15.680]  says, running Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:22.060]  And that came out a week into it that the Benghazi security force, it's on record. Now
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:29.880]  it's mainstream news yesterday. The Benghazi security force in Benghazi, the group of jihadis
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.160]  they brought in as their base of operations to take over all of Libya. Months after they've
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:36.980]  taken over all of Libya.
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:41.980]  Then they go and they're doing weapons transfers to the jihadis. And the jihadis show up and
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:47.260]  kill the ambassador and the security detail. And it came out in the news. Guys, type in
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:53.380]  in fact, I think it was even like New York Times or was it Al Jazeera headline. Benghazi
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:37:00.080]  attackers had inside intelligence or new State Department security secrets.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:07.180]  They knew stuff that most Navy SEALs don't know. And that's who they use to test most
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:12.680]  area security. That's who they send in against it. They knew more than most of the SEAL teams
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:17.940]  cuz most of them aren't assigned to that. I mean, they knew exactly where to hit. They
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:23.260]  knew everything. Now, again, they know everything. They're the local security detail.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:30.820]  There's an eight hour stand down. Ladies and gentlemen, this is naked. I didn't think this
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:34.300]  would come out. And these people, I mean, punch them back up cuz you guys were just
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:39.820]  showing the testimony. These people are freaked out. The idiot staffers don't know what's
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:40.820]  going on.
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:44.060]  The sellout congressmen, most of them, are just fumbling around and trying to whitewash
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:47.460]  things. The Republicans wanna score points but not go all the way cuz this could bring
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:52.460]  down their whole system. And when it cuts back to the people in the hearing, they are
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:55.720]  telling the truth. We already know cuz we already know all the facts, but it is just
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:57.940]  incredible to see this happening.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:03.740]  This is unprecedented. Now, I wanna apologize to Catherine Albrecht, host here on this
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:07.380]  network. But she knows, she's a host. She knows big breaking news, people move guests.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:12.560]  She'll be on it for a full hour next week on Google. The biggest hacker, the biggest
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:18.200]  computer crimes group in the world on record hacking into emails, breaking into computers,
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:22.900]  stealing data, NSA connected, above the law, doesn't even get in trouble.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:27.980]  And then they go around now with their browsers saying infowars.com and Drudge Report are
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:32.300]  malware. And then we scan our computers and it's not on there. And then it turns out it's
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:37.380]  a group connected to Google, this time and three years ago when they did it to Drudge,
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:38.380]  two and a half years ago.
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:44.780]  So just amazing how they run these false flags. I mean, they are, and you can have an antivirus
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.980]  deal. More and more, McAfee's doing this, even though I know the founder of McAfee had
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:53.700]  him on. They'll say stuff about Infowars, or you go to a library. They've got these
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:57.300]  programs that say, that's extremist, you're not allowed to go to infowars.com.
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:03.180]  They don't want you going there cuz we know what we're talking about. There it is, Drudge
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:08.060]  Report versus Google. Matt Drudge calls search engine out over malware designation. There,
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:12.500]  good job Drudge. Looks like Google doesn't like Drudge Report headlines this morning.
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:22.260]  Be a man. Drudge, Sergey, Drudge tweeted, I guess yesterday morning, along with the
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:26.460]  below image. Yeah, that's the images, and they all stood at the Infowars.
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:30.300]  Again, folks, we've got, I didn't even know Drudge did that. Good job, Drudge. I mean,
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.680]  we've got these people on our butts, man. You've got the White House saying, don't visit
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.540]  Drudge. I mean, we're afraid to let anybody talk cuz of Drudge. Because we can get the
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:43.820]  guest on, I can get the guest on, the colonels and former special ops, and the former head
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:48.660]  of state department black ops, and have them say, it was a hit, it was a murder.
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:51.980]  They went in, they ordered the stand down, this is Al-Qaeda, this is the local security
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:56.260]  force. That's why they stood down, either to kill the ambassador on purpose, or they
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:05.500]  were too embarrassed to airstrike their own Benghazi rebels. They just put in power. Either
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:10.260]  way, it's felony aiding and abetting murder.
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:13.440]  If you know somebody that works for you is coming to kill somebody, and you don't try
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:23.980]  to stop it, you now are an accomplice to capital premeditated murder. Red rum, backwards, red
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:31.260]  rum, Hillary Clinton, red rum, Barack Obama, red rum. Everybody that goes along with this,
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:36.580]  you're now part of red rum. When you help cover this up, you're now part of red rum.
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:45.260]  Red rum, red rum, red rum, red rum. Here's the New World Order, I'm coming in. And they're
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:48.300]  rushing on every front, what do they have to lose? They're going after the borders,
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:50.880]  they're going after the guns, they're bringing internet taxes, they're saying in the New
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.140]  York Times, we're spying on you without warrants, there's nothing you can do.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:00.940]  This is a full out blitzkrieg attack on everything right now. And you know what, we're beating
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:07.440]  them on a bunch of fronts. Dr. Katherine Albert, Harvard educated expert on technology,
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.100]  and it's abused for the last, I don't know, 13, 14 years writing best selling books, fighting
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:17.340]  it. I wanna get your take as you cover everything. Recent breast cancer survivor, very excited
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:21.200]  about that, hope you're doing well, hope that's still in complete remission.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.740]  We're all praying for you, I should have called and asked you that since the last you were
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:28.180]  here. So maybe give us a brief update on that, I know it's private info. But here you are
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:33.440]  with us, what do you make of this Benghazi? Cuz I'm not hyping this. This is bigger than
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:40.140]  catching them, staging, at least provocateuring the Boston deal. And what do you think they'll
[01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:44.860]  do now? What do you think about Benghazi A and B? What will they do to distract us?
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:48.460]  I mean, if they put out that Mohammed video to try to get everybody to riot the Middle
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:53.180]  East as a cover for this, a false flag. If they did Fast and Furious to try to get our
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:55.660]  guns, what will they do, Katherine Albrecht?
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:42:00.300]  Well, you know, Alex, this is always the question I ask any time they tell us of government
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:05.320]  misdeeds because their history is to cover it all up and they control the media. So they're
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:09.420]  clearly in a position to be able to cover it all up. And the fact that it's being brought
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:14.980]  to our attention repeatedly over and over on every mainstream media outlet makes me
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:20.060]  say, what gives? Why is it that they're taking their own and putting them up on the stand
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:25.360]  and hanging them out to dry, which admittedly they deserve that, but there are so many crimes
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:29.580]  going on in Washington, so many crimes going on at the highest levels of power within our
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.580]  military.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:34.580]  Why is this one being brought to our attention? And so this is always a question that I know
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:38.160]  you ask when when you're looking at these kinds of questions. And, you know, you talked
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.300]  about being right. Ninety five percent of the time. I got to say I'm with you. I'm waiting
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:46.460]  for the other shoe to drop. What is it that they're trying to gain from this? They've
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:50.400]  clearly got the whole country right now shaking their fist at Hillary Clinton, shaking their
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:55.960]  fist at all the main players who really screwed up over in Benghazi. But my question, why
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.700]  are they telling us about it?
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:03.660]  Listen, I have studied this from the inside with all these insiders from day one. I have
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:08.940]  been right on top of this, you know, really being focused on the West funding radical
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:13.860]  jihadi al Qaeda. I've been doing that for now 18 years. And I got to tell you from all
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:20.580]  my sources, they genuinely had a break. Even the CFR said that people were freaked out
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:22.860]  and the Bilderberg was concerned about this two years ago.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:27.780]  That people now know our government's funding al Qaeda to take over Libya and Syria. And
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:32.780]  they've had all these generals removed and admirals, the head of CENTCOM, because they're
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:40.340]  not going along. I think this is a genuine revolt happening. And Dick Cheney and people
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:44.900]  are trying to just call it negligence, which looks like they're criticizing Hillary.
[01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:49.780]  But that's the cover. And Senator Graham calling it negligence and systematic failure. This
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:55.540]  is not systematic failure. They wanted that ambassador dead. There was a torture base
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:44:00.220]  down the street. They ordered him not to help them. They had a warehouse full of missiles
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:07.340]  there. They don't want it on record that they want to be able to say al Qaeda stole the
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:11.620]  missiles down the road. So they were willing to kill the ambassador to do it. That's the
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:13.540]  best I can tell. What do you think?
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:17.460]  No, I think that makes sense. And then the real question is, who are they willing to
[01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:21.340]  sell down the river? You know, what's going to be the outcome? And I think that's really
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:25.340]  the question. You know, I get to thinking about this, Alex, that if Hillary Clinton
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:30.380]  had been forced to wear Google goggles, then we would have known exactly what she read
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:34.540]  exactly when she read it. And I'm certainly not advocating that people have to wear those.
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:37.660]  But that's one of my great fears. We're talking about Google and what they're doing to info
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:43.300]  wars and into the Drudge Report. But when we start talking about who knew what and when
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:47.760]  did they know it, it seems to me that that would be your perfect excuse for saying we
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:53.060]  need tighter controls over all communications. We need more surveillance equipment, even
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:58.700]  over, you know, key, key figures, important people. And of course, if they do begin to
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:02.340]  spew that rhetoric, you know, it's only going to affect us and it actually won't wind up
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:06.140]  affecting them. But that's another piece in the back of my mind, because a lot of this
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:13.160]  really is hinging on who knew what, said what, saw what, read what and when. And I'm kind
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.800]  of waiting for the surveillance piece to come up. Have you seen anybody mentioning that
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.160]  or gee, we need we need tighter control? Yes, they've actually already been saying that
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.940]  they had two drones right over it for eight hours. Off and on. They had C1 30s. They they've
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:30.220]  been caught lying. I mean, believe me, they don't that kind of backfires on them. Right.
[01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:34.800]  So this whole surveillance apparatus that they put in place is kind of like the cops
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:38.460]  who don't want you filming them. You know, they want the surveillance cameras on every
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:42.340]  corner and they want to be able to watch us and go through our email and spy through our
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:47.580]  windows with drones in our backyards. But they don't want their own activities observed
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:52.300]  and watch. And that's what they should know. Everything, what comes around goes around.
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:55.860]  You never get away with anything in this life. People say, I don't believe in God. I'm not
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:46:00.780]  worried about what I do. No, no. I found stuff comes back to you in this life. And anything
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:05.180]  you do bad sends out ripples that come back, not just on you, but your kids. And I think
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:07.900]  why they're going to get brought down, I really do think they're gonna get brought down unless
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:13.880]  they stage a huge false flag is that people love their children and folks realize the
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.740]  bottom has dropped out.
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:21.240]  Let's put up the whitewash headline there. It's U.S. too slow to act as drone cam captured
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:27.320]  Libyan horror. And that's back from October of last year. See, the drones were there.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:33.380]  They knew, they ordered to stand down and called the attack with artillery a protest
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:37.340]  just like they did in Libya and Syria. So I guess if somebody ever comes up and shoots
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:42.140]  you in the head, when the cops show up, you just say it's a protest, officers, like Benghazi
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:43.140]  or like Libya or Syria.
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:46.980]  You know, if you carpet bomb a country, it's a protest. But let me ask you about this,
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:51.460]  then we're gonna go to break, come back with calls. Look at this in the New York Times
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:56.220]  today. U.S. is weighing wide overhaul of wiretaps. We have the FBI deputy head of counterterrorism
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:02.180]  Monday on CNN say everything you say is recorded.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:05.540]  We're not just listening in live time and he smiled. So now they're flaunting what you
[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:10.320]  and I already know. Now listen, the Obama administration resolving years of internal
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:16.340]  debate is on the verge of backing a Federal Bureau of Investigation plan for a sweeping
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:17.340]  overhaul of surveillance.
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.780]  It's an overhaul. You know, Big Brother's an overhaul of surveillance laws that would
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:25.580]  make it easier to wiretap people who communicate using Internet rather than by traditional
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:30.260]  phones according to FBI, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. Well, that's
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:34.740]  all in the Cybersecurity Act that you know about where they preemptively say they're
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:38.860]  gonna use in court the fact that they're already spying on us.
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:42.820]  And he says that on CNN. He goes, well, we're not using it in court yet. They're already
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:47.860]  doing it. Now they want to be able to just preemptively do whatever they want. I mean,
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:50.620]  this is hardcore tyranny. What's your take on that?
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:54.740]  Well, you know, this is an arms race and it's an information arms race is what it really
[01:47:54.740 --> 01:48:01.500]  is. And the reason I was so interested in what Google was doing to Infowars is because
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:04.900]  we're to the point now, you know, we like to think that we're all we've got all this
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:08.760]  distributed communication and we're all networked and grassroots.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:13.140]  But the reality is, if Google were to take Infowars or my website or any website off
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:16.820]  of the Internet, 90 percent of people out there would never see it again. I mean, that
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:24.780]  would be the end of it, because we've consolidated so much power into these these very few places
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:28.200]  that are disseminating all of our information, helping us find stuff.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:33.800]  So we really need to be thinking as they start talking about this, what really is an information
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:38.300]  endgame, if they get to the point where they pass this sales tax, which is probably going
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:42.340]  to go through, that's going to give them the right to audit all of your communications
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:47.220]  and online purchases, of course, because they want their income and they would then have
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:50.840]  a justification and then they start talking about all this efficiency and security and
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:52.540]  wiretapping and this and that.
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:57.300]  And you could get to the point where you could see somebody like Google not listing Infowars.com
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:01.040]  any longer. And then you could see if you try to get to it through some other means
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:05.220]  that the wiretapping and all the surveillance would be able to figure out who's going there.
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:09.700]  So we're getting to the point where I think we need to be looking at alternative ways
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:12.620]  of communicating, just like you're always talking about alternative ways of getting
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:15.880]  off the grid or getting food independence.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:19.700]  We need to be thinking about getting Internet independence and communication independence,
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:23.180]  because if we're not careful that this net that they're tightening is going to tighten
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:28.340]  so much that we're going to really when they drop the boom and they shut the Internet down
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:32.980]  and say no one can get on it unless you have your biometric eye scan and your government
[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:37.100]  approval comrade, at that point, a whole lot of us are not going to know how to communicate.
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.060]  So we need to be thinking about these things.
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:44.020]  That's why we've got to still go with terrestrial radio. We've got to have print publications.
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:48.500]  People got to support and keep the DVDs and make copies and keep their old computers because
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.660]  all the new computers are going to be on cloud.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:55.720]  You're not going to be able to keep data yourself. This is the forced conversion and they admit
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:02.620]  that's the plan. But for those that just joined us to have Google three years ago with Drudge,
[01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:08.460]  come out and say he was serving malware when it turned out it was Drudge not doing it,
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.740]  but Google doing it.
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:13.900]  And now they're doing it to Drudge and us. And we went and looked. It wasn't true. And
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:18.940]  the White House is attacking us and all their surrogates are. People better appreciate info
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:23.940]  wars because what's my goal? My goal is to beat these people. And folks, I'm not on a
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:26.700]  power trip. I know how small we really are.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:30.460]  It freaks me out to know we're some of the most prominent people in the world that actually
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:33.700]  have analyzed this attack profile and are fighting it. And it's good to know you're
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:38.860]  there, Catherine. We need more people. Give us your Web site for folks that want to visit
[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:40.340]  that one while it's still available.
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:44.780]  Well, I'm a KMA show dot com or just Catherine Albrecht dot com. But let me also suggest
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:49.220]  people check out X quick dot com, which is the private alternative to Google, because
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:52.020]  we don't serve Google results if they filter you off of Google.
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:55.460]  Absolutely. We got to boycott Google now. We're gonna be on about that next week. Phone

[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:05.860]  or thyroid gland? Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:10.020]  both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body? Wherever mercury deposits in your
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:14.620]  body, it stops cells from functioning normally. Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:19.380]  function to drop by 60%. Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:23.460]  corresponding drop in function. The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:28.460]  of mercury is glutathione. The number one superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:33.340]  cells in your body to produce glutathione is non denatured whey protein from grass fed
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:38.980]  cows. After investigating most high end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:43.960]  non denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:51.780]  nature originally put into the fresh raw whey. It is One World Whey. Call 888-988-3325. That's

[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:40.700]  Alright, I'm gonna take phone calls now and analyze the live hearings. I've got my reporter
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:46.940]  John Bowne out there, Kurt Nemo, Adan Salazar, all writing notes, updating info wars.com
[01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:52.240]  with a live update page with the video feeds that the mainstream media is censoring with
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:56.660]  the latest. They're now confirming that there was not a backlog of transportation on the
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.140]  ground or the air.
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:02.260]  They could have helped them. They've got all the State Department witnesses, you name it,
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:09.780]  who were there explaining they were told to stand down and that the White House is lying.
[01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:16.640]  Hillary Clinton is lying. And I expect them to stage something big, some new war, some
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:22.340]  new crisis, some new something, an assassination attempt, God only knows, something to make
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:25.820]  themselves look like victims.
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:31.240]  Because this is so big, folks. Now, this has been hiding in plain view. You ask, well,
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:37.720]  why is it coming out? Is there something behind this? No, they just did it so sloppy in front
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.620]  of everybody and thought this was 20 years ago when they control the media.
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:46.780]  They do not control the media. No one trusts a word they say. And Gregory Hicks is up there
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:51.540]  telling the truth because I've studied this. My expert guests have studied it and he is
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:58.220]  telling the truth. Don't forget, folks, to support info wars.com. We sold out of the
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:04.220]  May issue of the magazine, 30,000 copies at cost, boom, sold out.
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:08.180]  Sheldon came in this morning, he said there's about 1,000 left right now. Do you wanna sell
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:12.880]  them individually so everybody who wants one who missed them has a chance to get them?
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:18.160]  And now that's all that's there is singles with the free bumper stickers inside. And
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:22.900]  I lost money on this cuz I usually sell them for like a dollar a piece. With the stickers
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:27.940]  and all the rest of it, the shipping, I lose money. But we're selling for 7.95 a piece
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:32.300]  so we can pay for stickers in maybe the July issue again.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:37.820]  So get this collector double cover issue right now at infowarsstore.com with the March issue
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:42.380]  of exposing false flag terror. And the history of false flag terror, very important issue,
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:48.060]  limited copies, three stickers inside, infowars.com and prisonflooded.com and save the Constitution
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:49.300]  bumper stickers.
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:55.840]  It's available right now, probably less than 1,000 right now, available at infowarsstore.com
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:00.340]  if you wanna get them. And obviously the price has gone up cuz it's the last 1,000 of those.
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:03.920]  And I had the idea, I said, yeah, let's charge more so we can pay for stickers again or part
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:09.940]  of the stickers again. Maybe put it in 50,000 copies with the stickers, it's so expensive
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:10.940]  in July.
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:18.780]  So again, infowarsstore.com. Now I'm gonna go to Ironhead, Ramon, Mankind, Sean. I had
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:23.140]  a caller in France, he just hung up. Hope that caller in France gets back in. Nelson

[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:41.100]  I get so busy on air that I've got all these paid sponsors that get paid when I plug them.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:44.500]  He mows on radio, they plug every segment, they're sponsors, cuz that's where the real
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:47.140]  listenership and the real advertising is.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:51.820]  Notice that you don't hear me really do that. And I need the money to fund their operation,
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:59.260]  so just go to infowarsstore.com, buy the Propure water filters. With the Propure water filters,
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:04.180]  the Pro1 filters with a 10% discount with promo code water, already off the lowest price.

[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:22.700]  to other people. Put them on AXS TV, upload them to the web, hit them with information

[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:56.180]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:59:01.460]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:05.780]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:10.740]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:15.580]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:20.820]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:20.660]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin Texas,
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:36.020]  Alex Jones. I just talked to Wayne Madsen. He's parking
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:39.940]  his car and going into an airport. Before he goes into the checkpoint, he'll be on for
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:44.580]  about five, six minutes at the start of the next segment, formerly with the NSA. He called
[02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:49.700]  Benghazi the week of it exactly as it happened. So did Colonel Shaffer. So did all my other
[02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:54.740]  guests. I mean, this was an assassination of that ambassador. And they have been caught
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:01:00.340]  and I have never seen anything like this. And no wonder CNN and MSNBC cut away. We've
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:05.140]  got the live coverage at Infowars.com. I'm taking calls the whole hour. We'll get Jeffrey
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:08.700]  Smith on next week. Apologize to him, but he understands breaking news. I want to get
[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:12.980]  him on next week. Great author, researcher on GMO. Or if he wants to do five minutes,
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:17.980]  he can do that on the march against Monsanto. But I want him on for a full hour next week.
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:23.300]  Thank you. Let's go to your phone calls right now. Ironhead in Washington. You're on the
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:28.140]  air. Go ahead. My God, are we living in grand times or what?
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:32.300]  I think some of us were born to see when all truth shall become known as the master once
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:38.020]  said key salient points regarding this. This is roasting the pig, a.k.a. that wretched
[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:43.780]  hive of scum and villainy of the elder beast. But I think she's going to be the target fixation.
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:47.300]  The whole thing is going to wind up being a dog and pony show to take us in the wrong
[02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:51.180]  direction. You and Catherine already hit the nail on the head that we've got to be ultra,
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:54.380]  ultra, ultra careful as to how this thing is being utilized.
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:59.260]  Oh, they're already trying to spin it as they screwed up. They didn't screw up. They murdered
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:04.460]  this guy by ordering the stand down and gave them pinpoint intelligence on how to take
[02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:08.940]  him out. They were obviously trained. I mean, it probably took two weeks to train people
[02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:15.800]  how to do this. I mean, it's incredible. Right now, one of the things, remember the main,
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:19.860]  remember the Alamo, one of the key salient points I think you could address every single
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:23.900]  show is remember Benghazi, because the key right now is to get every single person wearing
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:29.380]  a uniform to realize that they can be the dupes, the victims and the takeout, the cutouts.
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:33.340]  It's got to happen that everybody knows in this whole country what's going down, because
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:39.860]  as you said, this is magnum as time is more great than people ask why this is happening.
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:44.120]  Conservatively, 35 percent of the military listens to this show. I've talked to hundreds
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.820]  of military active duty in-person officers, non-commissioned officers, grunts. They go,
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:55.140]  no, about 35 percent, some say half, half the people they know listen to the show and
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:56.140]  are aware.
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:59.980]  When the military and the police, the globalists haven't got the robots in charge yet who will
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:05.120]  follow orders. Unquestioningly, they've still got humans. They haven't gotten even close
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:10.020]  to that conversion yet. What are they gonna do when all their own people know criminals
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:15.740]  are in charge? It's game over, folks. I mean, listen, we can win when we have the initiative
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:17.040]  and have the intelligence.
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:22.820]  When you're aware of the operation, it's over. And now that the idea of false flag is out
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:26.940]  there, it's the beginning of the end for these people.
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:29.100]  And Alex, one quick note, if you don't mind.
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:30.100]  Yeah.
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:35.440]  Yet Adam Kokesh and yourself and everybody in this country, not just Washington, DC,
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:41.740]  the whole country, C to C, the C to C Benghazi movement, how's that sound? Where if you can't
[02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:46.260]  get to Washington, DC, start in your state capitol, your council, your city-
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:50.660]  And I'll say this, I mean, here's the deal. I don't come out and say have an armed march.
[02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:55.380]  Because even if it's legal and lawful in your area, they'll still trump something up sometimes
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:56.380]  and arrest you.
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:04:00.540]  So I've never called for one. I've talked about other people's. But when I talk about
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:04.140]  one, I always say it's dangerous. It's like filming police could be dangerous. I go out
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:08.760]  and do it. But this country's in so much trouble, you could get beat up and taken to jail, which
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:11.380]  is all the more reason you should go out and do it.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:16.420]  Because it shows how far this has gone. But again, ladies and gentlemen, you've got to
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:20.420]  point out they've got the moral low ground now. And most of the police and military I
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:24.580]  talked to are finally going, all right, I apologize, you're right, my God, how did it
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:25.580]  get so bad?
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:29.780]  Look at other countries, look at history. But I do think people in their area should
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:35.740]  organize legal, lawful armed marches in every capital of this country. The problem is a
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:39.960]  lot of capitals violate the law, the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and say you can't do it. So
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:44.140]  check your local unconstitutional laws cuz they don't care. They'll still try to take
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:45.140]  you to jail.
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:50.940]  But yes, we should have a July 4th armed marches to exercise our right or lose it. Why can
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:56.260]  government have guns? But a slave with a gun is such a shocking image. This is what real
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:05:01.140]  resistance and real July 4th is all about.
[02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:05.860]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:10.620]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:16.060]  you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's

[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:35.460]  gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us. We're into the third
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:40.500]  hour. I'll probably go into overdrive today. The Benghazi hearings are ongoing. John Bowne
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:45.740]  is in there watching it with headphones, taking notes. So is Kurt Nemo. So is Adan Salazar.
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:49.500]  We know this. Wayne Madsen, who's been to Libya many times and Syria, formerly with
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:53.620]  the National Security Agency, writes for some of the biggest publications in the country,
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:58.060]  Wayne Madsen Report.com. We know that Wayne came on and laid out everything that happened
[02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:02.160]  a week after from his sources. Then it all later got confirmed in the press. Much of
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:06.180]  what you're hearing is actually all been in the news. There were drones overhead. There
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:10.620]  was a stand down. It wasn't two hours. It wasn't six. It was eight hours from start
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:16.780]  to finish. The guys that attacked over 400 of them, first 200, then 400, new precision.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:21.380]  Where to attack? Inside State Department info. That's the proof it was a hit, from my view.
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:25.180]  Colonel Schafer says clearly they were trying to kill him and it was a professional hit.
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:30.540]  The question is did some outside country fund him or was it our government? It's the globalist.
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:34.280]  It's NATO that Obama says were under their control. Will they stage a false flag to cover
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:40.220]  this up? This is not some controlled Iran Contra as a political football. The congressman
[02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:44.620]  body language is they're all freaked out. The Republicans are like, what have we gotten
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:45.620]  into?
[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:49.140]  We just wanna score points, not bring down our whole criminal system. It's really like
[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:55.420]  Clinton on the sex stuff cuz that's one thing that was just isolated to perjury, not missile
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:59.540]  secrets to China and stuff like that. So much of the leadership of both parties are involved
[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:03.720]  in. And I'd love to see Obama go to jail. I'd love to see him impeached. I'd love to
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:04.900]  see Hillary go to prison.
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:09.460]  That would really put a dent in the government as this big imperial thing. I hate the Clinton
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:14.580]  crime syndicate, and I'd like to see the Tea Party take over with this. But let me tell
[02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:20.820]  you, you got Cheney running defense going, they're just idiots. They need to get in trouble.
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:24.540]  Blow that up so I can read those Drudge Report headlines for people. Blow that up for me
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:30.380]  right there. Yeah, go ahead and center it for me. That's the most important part for
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:35.220]  me. Okay, well, I'll punch it up on my computer. Watch this. Watch this move. The way to do
[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:39.260]  it is you just go to Drudge like that.
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:42.640]  And then all I gotta do is just move. Check it out, you just punch mine up. I understand
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:45.420]  your computer, I didn't let you do that. And then that's how, cuz I just can't read it
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:50.860]  that way. Thanks, bro. There you go. Shock testimony from Benghazi witness. Moment by
[02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:56.660]  moment account of attack. Emotional recollection of murders. Congressman, death is part of
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:11:02.180]  life. And how do you make death part of life? Dems blame budget cuts. Yeah, I told you they
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:03.540]  didn't want money.
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:10.800]  Another vows to protect others at State Department. Fourth whistleblower blocked from testifying.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:15.580]  Witness told not to meet with congressional investigators. You see that? That's the criminal
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:20.820]  cover up. White House claims attempts to politicize. Well, of course, I mean, what would you do?
[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:26.220]  You staged gun attacks to get our guns, you criminals. Operation Smear already under worry.
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:31.340]  Bolton could bring them down administration. Cheney rips leadership. Hillary in spotlight.
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:38.300]  Mother, I blame her, blame Hillary. Go to infoawars.com. There's a bunch of big breaking
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:42.060]  news today, folks, that I haven't even gotten to.
[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:45.420]  In fact, that's an old page. I need to hit refresh. Looks like the site's getting so
[02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:48.820]  much traffic, it's not coming up. I'm going to Wayne Madsen in your calls in a moment.
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:53.820]  Punch up infoawars for me so I can give people the latest headlines, please. Not my screen,
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:57.180]  punch it up on your screen. Thank you. I'm gonna probably, the answer to this is I need
[02:11:57.180 --> 02:11:58.180]  three computers.
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:03.860]  I need three computers now, not one. Show that no matter how bad computers are nowadays,
[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:10.460]  I'll be able to do it. Okay, there they are. Rand Paul, Benghazi should end Hillary Clinton.
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:17.340]  Good, Rand Paul, go after that witch. Latest on Benghazi, continuing live updates, infoawars.com.
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:22.940]  Judge orders conspiracy reeducation for Lauryn Hill, the singer, who exposed it's all a bunch
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:26.980]  of devil-worshipping mafia, and that if you won't be evil, they kick you out.
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:32.500]  I've been told that by top insiders, and they all brag about it now. He sent her for, quote,
[02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:37.380]  reeducation. You can't make this up. Senator Manchin, background checks, expands Second
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:41.900]  Amendment. See, that's the new spin. Obama supports the Second Amendment, he said, in
[02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:52.760]  Mexico. What's the other guy? Yeah, Bloomberg. I'm the biggest supporter of the Constitution
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:53.760]  there is.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:57.220]  I'm the biggest supporter of the Second Amendment, that's a quote. It's all psyops. I support
[02:12:57.220 --> 02:13:02.580]  your right to have guns, have them all turned in. If you can jump through 1,000 hoops on
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:06.580]  a blue moon, maybe, and give me political donations, I'll let you have a gun. We're
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:09.140]  all gonna be exempt, of course there's trapdoors.
[02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:15.300]  You might win the lottery. Joining us formerly with the NSA journalist to give us his take
[02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:20.460]  on what's happening, he joins us as he drives into the airport, Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:26.900]  I just recap for some people that just joined us. How big is this? I don't see them surviving
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:32.060]  this politically. What do you expect to come out? I mean, this is seismic. If they don't
[02:13:32.060 --> 02:13:33.900]  all go to jail, I don't know.
[02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:38.140]  I mean, they're in the New York Times saying, yeah, we spy on you without warrants, get
[02:13:38.140 --> 02:13:46.220]  used to it. I mean, or is this just an attempt to like a pimp dominating his property, driving
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:51.020]  us into submission? Maybe Obama will start executing children on the White House lawn
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:55.620]  with a straight razor and he'll be given a Nobel Peace Prize for every child he beats
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:57.860]  their brains out with, a ball peen hammer.
[02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:01.180]  I mean, how absurdist is it going to get, Wayne Madsen?
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:09.740]  Well, this is the 800 pound gorilla in the room. It is all about the US supporting Al
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:16.380]  Qaeda in overthrowing Muammar Gaddafi. John Brennan, who was Obama's Deputy National
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:22.700]  Security Advisor, there's now reports that he actually went to Mecca, so his name should
[02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:29.780]  be Al-Hajj John Brennan. He made the Hajj to Mecca. He's very pro-Wahabi. He's now
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:35.900]  the director of the CIA. This is when it really started to bring him out, push him out of
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:40.900]  the shadows, because he supported these Libyan Islamic fighter group rebels, many of whom
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:46.980]  were Al Qaeda veterans of Afghanistan, Iraq, where they took shots at American soldiers,
[02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:53.860]  by the way, blew up Americans, Iraqis, Afghans, you name it, and other ally troops in both
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:15:01.100]  those countries. The issue is Chris Stevens went into Libya apparently to try to get back
[02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:07.700]  some of the weapons used to overthrow Gaddafi, including some sophisticated weapons, but
[02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:12.620]  other people had ideas to take those weapons into Syria after Gaddafi were going to get
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:19.420]  Assad. So we've got that thing playing out, and we've got Susan Rice, of course, stating
[02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:28.060]  that it was all about the innocence of Muslims, that ridiculous movie trailer that was released.
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:32.940]  And of course, the neocons were behind that, too. So what we have here, two operations,
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:39.100]  one by Brennan with his Saudi friends and his Salafist friends in Libya and Syria, and
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:43.700]  the good old neocons who were prevalent during Bush and still have some influence in the
[02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:50.220]  Obama administration, but movie, which was intended to trigger violence all over the
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:56.900]  Muslim world. So we had a clash, not like the neocons say, a clash of civilizations.
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:16:01.220]  We had a clash of CIA operations.
[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:05.540]  And that just shows the lawlessness of this. Why did they order up to an eight hour stand
[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:11.420]  down and why were they so brazen to lie about it and then have an FBI connected group produce
[02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:18.780]  the fake Mohammed garbage? I mean, it's just never, where do you see this going now?
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:27.460]  You know, I think what we have to do is find out what loyalty John Brennan promised the
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:34.980]  regime in Riyadh, these Saudis, and also their friends and his friends in Doha, Qatar, who
[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:40.460]  fund things right now like Al Jazeera and current TV. The Qatar is turning into a huge
[02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:45.660]  propaganda element in the Middle East and the Muslim world. So we've got to find out
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:49.860]  just how much of the United States Mr. Brennan has sold down the river.
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:54.220]  This guy is a knuckle dragger. You know, you saw him during the confirmation hearings and
[02:16:54.220 --> 02:17:01.340]  then he takes the oath of office on a copy of the Constitution. This guy is a real snake
[02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:02.340]  in the grass.
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:06.780]  Let me ask you a question. What do you expect to come out of this? Am I right in saying
[02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:12.780]  this is a seismic meltdown to have these people up there all admitting that it's all a lie
[02:17:12.780 --> 02:17:15.200]  and it was a stand down?
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:19.980]  It could be terrible news for Hillary Clinton. Once again, they're bringing out her coronation
[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:27.380]  crown for 2016. If I were Joe Biden right now, I'd be sitting back and laughing at
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:32.780]  this and also prodding some people. Look, how can we use this to our advantage? Because,
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:39.420]  you know, it's clear that the two that are going for the Democratic nomination of 2016,
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:43.420]  you know, obviously Hillary, but I think Joe Biden has had a taste of that White House
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:48.060]  that, you know, maybe his wife, Jill, has already measured the White House windows for
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:49.060]  trade.
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:52.060]  Oh, so you're saying Democrats could even be trying to burn Hillary down?
[02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:58.620]  Oh, yeah, yeah. I think Joe Biden would like nothing more than to hurt Hillary so he can,
[02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:03.180]  you know, come up in the polls. He's trailing very bailey amongst Democrats, about 16 percent.
[02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:08.540]  It's a total lunatic as well. Now, now, but I mean, but I mean, looking at Iran-Contra,
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:14.760]  looking at Nixon-type stuff, even Clinton-type stuff, I've never seen them caught in such
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:18.420]  a huge lie working with Al-Qaeda.
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:22.820]  How do you expect them to get out of this, starting a new war, blowing something up?
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:25.140]  I mean, what do you see in your crystal ball, Wayne Madsen?
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:30.140]  Well, I see more problems than Southern Russia after the Boston Marathon bombing, and we've
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:36.300]  got CIA fingerprints all over that. That's a nice little number now. So I see them trying
[02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:42.700]  to divert attention away from this problem in Libya, maybe with Syria, although that
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:48.220]  gets right to the same issue, U.S. supporting Al-Qaeda elements. There may be some more
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:54.260]  problems with Iran as well. I see Iran as a very nice diversion here. So that's what
[02:18:54.260 --> 02:19:00.340]  I'd be looking at, some big crisis with the U.S. and Iran.
[02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:05.060]  I agree with you. Always a penetrating analysis. About 30 seconds left. Any other points, Wayne
[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:06.060]  Madsen?
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:11.140]  Well, I just wanted to say I'm out here in Seattle with the first Wayne Madsen report
[02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:15.860]  beat up, and I think we all have to organize, meet our readers. I know you do that. I've
[02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:19.500]  just done it for the first time, and I think we've just got to get with our people and
[02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:24.340]  find out what kind of resources we have and march on.
[02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:29.220]  That's right. We've all got to up our game, because tyranny is just, are they fleeing
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:34.100]  forward in government and corporations? It seems like they're assaulting freedom at an
[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:36.740]  accelerated pace. Do you agree that that's a flight forward?
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:44.900]  Oh, yeah. I just got off the Seattle ferry, and they come by with the dog snippets. There's
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:50.420]  homeland security people around everywhere. So even out here in the pristine Pacific Northwest,
[02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:51.420]  you see this over ferry.
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:55.300]  Oh, yeah. They want to find Al-Qaeda, they just go to the Pentagon and go to the White
[02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:58.540]  House. Thank you so much, Wayne Madsen. Your call is straight ahead, callers. I'm going
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:00.980]  right to you after this. And more on Benghazi.
[02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:06.100]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:11.340]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:15.580]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[02:20:15.580 --> 02:20:20.060]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.
[02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:24.980]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:29.860]  Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability

[02:22:55.760 --> 02:23:00.900]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:04.780]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:09.460]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably haven't heard
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:13.160]  about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:19.300]  most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:25.220]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:29.980]  may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:35.860]  But here's some good news. There's an underground video at Exposed123.com that thousands of
[02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:41.180]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:46.420]  at Exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing
[02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:50.780]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now
[02:23:50.780 --> 02:24:03.740]  at Exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's Exposed123.com.
[02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:10.300]  From his Central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:14.980]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:22.180]  You got a business? You didn't build that. Somebody else did that. Look at this NBC headline.
[02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:26.780]  Human takeover by machines may be closer than we think. And it's all these top scientists
[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:32.460]  warning. Oh, yeah, and the genetic engineering, all of it. And this is the plan. So now they're
[02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:36.140]  telling you, oh, this is just what's going to happen. That's what the globalists plan
[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:40.900]  on doing. We got a different plan. I'm telling you, folks, you can kiss your kids goodbye
[02:24:40.900 --> 02:24:46.700]  if the new world order comes in. I made Endgame seven years ago and broke this down and the
[02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:49.500]  media attacked me for it cuz I had their quotes.
[02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:54.580]  They would say Alex Jones says the elite's gonna kill us and take over and merge with
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:25:00.660]  machines and live forever. No, they say that. They say that. Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:05.460]  Ramon, Mankind, Sean, Ryan, Rich and others. And I got a bunch of other news I haven't
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:06.460]  gotten to yet.
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:10.220]  John Bounds coming in too with an update. It is incredible. People are trying to get
[02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:14.220]  away and getting carjacked, just randomly robbed cuz it's lawless after the takeover
[02:25:14.220 --> 02:25:19.900]  in Libya. And they would call back security at bases that were separate. It was like a
[02:25:19.900 --> 02:25:23.660]  stand down. They didn't want anybody getting out of that attack.
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:28.900]  Folks, they ran the whole thing. I mean, this is incredible. Because it's their own people.
[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:35.340]  You see, you get it? Comprende? You figure that out yet? All you idiots that think the
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:41.140]  government's good? The government isn't there anymore. It's mega ruthless banks that have
[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:42.700]  computers doing actuaries.
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:48.180]  I don't know how to explain it to you. Ramon in Florida, thanks for holding your on the
[02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:49.180]  air.
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:50.980]  What's going on, my brother?
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:51.980]  It's craziness.
[02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:57.700]  What's going on, Alex? It's definitely crazy, but we got the smoking gun. We have live testimony.
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:01.500]  You know what I'm saying? All we have to do is just prove it to people. They always call
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:06.820]  us crazy, paranoid, conspiracy theorists, but they can't prove it. All they do is emotionally
[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:07.820]  attack us.
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:11.680]  They try to appeal to people's emotions, but they never come with factual evidence. We
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:16.300]  have hardcore evidence that proves that this government is fraud. And the one before that,
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:20.460]  and the one before that. It's all the same thing. The bankers are trying to take over,
[02:26:20.460 --> 02:26:22.260]  but they're not. It's over for them.
[02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:26.660]  Well, see, what's happening is they run things that are able to rob, but they're not taking
[02:26:26.660 --> 02:26:31.740]  over our minds. So there's that paradox. But yeah, and now they're getting so arrogant,
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:35.180]  but it's biting them in the butt. What do you think about the Benghazi hearings?
[02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:39.860]  And I think it's exactly what the soldiers are saying. They split down. They let those
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:44.860]  people die because the people who run this government, the real owners of this land,
[02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:49.700]  the so-called elite, want everyone to die. Whether you work for them, whether you're
[02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:54.380]  against them, whether you believe in what they're telling you. They want you to die.
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:58.340]  They want to kill you. They want to rape your children. If you think it's not real, go look
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:02.860]  at an LCK still representative from Florida saying that he wants to pass a law that says
[02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:08.060]  it's okay to be a pedophile. It shouldn't be a crime. You should go to a doctor because
[02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:09.060]  it's a mental issue.
[02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:14.420]  It is an army, I agree, because I've studied it. A normal person never thinks like this.
[02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:20.620]  They're an army of psychopaths, control freaks, child molesters. They're a legion of doom.
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:24.860]  That's not normal, Alex. That's the thing. We have God in our heart. All these people
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:29.220]  who think they're normal, they're Satanists. They're Luciferians. Because anyone who doesn't
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:34.340]  have sympathy for little children getting blown up in Arab and African and Asian countries,
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:39.420]  you're not a real Christian. You're not a real Muslim. You're not a real human. We fight
[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:46.860]  for freedom, liberty. That's why I support Alex Jones. Everybody who speaks truth, everybody
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:50.780]  who's fighting this corrupt new world order, we're winning. We have their back against
[02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:56.020]  the wall. They're scared. There's nothing they can do. This criminal empire is over.
[02:27:56.020 --> 02:28:01.020]  Freedom and God has won. So everybody who's on the dark side, bye bye. See you guys in
[02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:05.840]  Armageddon. When we're fighting good versus evil with God on our side, you'll see how
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:11.500]  you fail. You'll see that everybody who's speaking like Alex Jones is telling the truth.
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:17.320]  We are heroes, martyrs, libertarians, freedom fighters. You can call me crazy all you want,
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:20.540]  but I bet you I'll fight for your freedom just as hard as I will for mine.
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:24.340]  Well that's amazing, Ramon. God bless you. Powerful call. Long segment coming up with
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:29.400]  Sean, Rich, Mankind, Ryan. We'll get to all of you right after this break. Yeah, I see
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:34.300]  the attacks on us, which I don't mind myself personally. I really don't. Back to the sick
[02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:38.880]  level I like it, which I've repented of and I'm not involved in anymore. I like to watch
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:42.500]  attacks on me, but I just don't do it anymore. It's sick.
[02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:46.780]  But I think it's funny at a sick level. But it does hurt me that it keeps other people
[02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:51.100]  who aren't sophisticated from finding the truth. I bring all these guests on, all these
[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:55.740]  diverse groups, all these diverse ideas. An hour long interview with Professor Griff,
[02:28:55.740 --> 02:28:58.260]  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted two weeks ago.
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:03.620]  Waking up people, just what he has to say. Or Ron Paul, what he has to say. Or Cybele
[02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:09.440]  Edmonds, what she has to say, a whistleblower. They hate this platform. They hate a platform
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:12.700]  they don't control. They hate Drudge Report as a platform they don't control. They hate
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:16.420]  anything they don't control. And that's why they're always trying to say I'm a Fed or
[02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:19.020]  I'm Bill Hicks or I'm all this crazy stuff.
[02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:22.420]  Because the evil that's in them, not even that they're operatives, but the evil that's
[02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:28.100]  in them of the world makes them hate me because deep down they hate goodness. Doesn't mean
[02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:33.100]  I'm perfect, but my heart's good. I want to do good. Anybody who has discernment knows
[02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:36.820]  that. People that don't, who've woken up, but are still evil, they're just flailing
[02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:42.820]  around in fighting because they're not meant, I guess, to ever really figure it all out.
[02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:47.940]  It's very, very sad. But it doesn't matter. You know you're good out there. Get out there
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:50.220]  and warn other people. That's what counts.
[02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:59.220]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:05.660]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:10.500]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:14.740]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:20.140]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:25.460]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:31.100]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:35.700]  Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:40.340]  need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've

[02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:14.140]  has become reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized
[02:32:14.140 --> 02:32:19.500]  globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves
[02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:24.660]  the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This
[02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:28.820]  documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[02:32:28.820 --> 02:32:33.720]  powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic
[02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:40.020]  has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers,
[02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:45.380]  sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[02:32:45.380 --> 02:32:50.540]  the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's

[02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:34.660]  GCN Radio Network. Waging war on corruption. Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:48.700]  You have found it. The very front line in the fight for human liberty worldwide. All
[02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:55.700]  you people that think evil is powerful, you have no idea what you're turning loose. I
[02:33:55.700 --> 02:34:00.620]  tell you, ladies and gentlemen, everyone that serves this system is twisted at one level
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:01.620]  or another.
[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:07.760]  None of us are perfect, but the people that consciously serve this evil are buying into
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:12.420]  total oblivion because they are of their father, the devil. You had that caller earlier talking
[02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:16.580]  about how people that don't have empathy that say glass parking lot all the Arabs, fake
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:22.740]  conservatives, you're really fascist. People that don't have empathy across the board are
[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:24.260]  losing their humanity.
[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:30.500]  And you talk to them, they're the most empty, unhappy nobodies. Because you don't have the
[02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:36.700]  spiritual nerve endings to feel and see spiritually what's going on around you. Or you can just
[02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:41.620]  call it the way humans are designed, whatever. I know I've got free will. I know I've got
[02:34:41.620 --> 02:34:47.020]  the seed of the universe in me. I know I'm made in the image of God. When I talk about
[02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:50.780]  the feeling that we've been here forever and how ancient we are, I believe we're appointed
[02:34:50.780 --> 02:34:53.220]  to live once.
[02:34:53.220 --> 02:35:00.020]  But we have in our genetic code, we have the memories of our ancestors. That's been proven
[02:35:00.020 --> 02:35:05.540]  across the spectrum. That's what instincts are. That's what dreams are. That's what archetypes
[02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:13.180]  are. And the system knows this. The only way to survive and thrive is to be a builder,
[02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:20.620]  is to be a giver, is to be someone that conquers their darker side and reaches for the stars.
[02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:24.780]  That is what God wants from you. And again, those of you that say there isn't a God, I
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:30.020]  look at the fruits of your life. I look at who you are, what you stand for. And almost
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:37.100]  unanimously, you can't even see evil. And I want you to have discernment. And I'm not
[02:35:37.100 --> 02:35:44.900]  on some high horse here. It's just, I want you to win. I want you to succeed. I want
[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:48.820]  to succeed my children and their children.
[02:35:48.820 --> 02:35:54.420]  And Professor Griff said this as well in the interview we just posted on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:35:54.420 --> 02:35:58.220]  Professor Griff calls on the world to unite against the new world order. Powerful. We're
[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:01.780]  going back to your calls here in a moment. Bound's coming in the next segment to give
[02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:07.460]  us a news update on Benghazi. But it's about the choices we make. It's about the choices
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:11.340]  all of us make that will decide the future of this world.
[02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:15.940]  All right, let me tell you about a few of the sponsors that make the broadcast possible.
[02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:19.700]  And I'm gonna go right back to your calls. One of them is efoodsdirect.com forward slash

[02:36:55.540 --> 02:37:03.500]  Shifting gears as well, my mother's had dramatic effects. You know, Aaron Dykes lost 90 something
[02:37:03.500 --> 02:37:08.180]  pounds working with the young longevity products. Everybody raves about them. It gives me more
[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:11.300]  energy. A lot of times I'm gonna work till midnight or two in the morning. Instead of
[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:15.300]  having coffee, I have a Beyond Tangy Tangerine or a Polymers Plus.

[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:45.460]  Ben Fuchs and Mary Lou Henner, who we're gonna be getting on the show, by the way. She has
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:49.300]  that genetic memory that they say is like one out of 50 million. She's a listener of
[02:37:49.300 --> 02:37:53.100]  the show. We're gonna get her in studio soon. So the videos are all there. Infowarshealth,
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:58.860]  a lot of news, a new study that's been out a few months now out of the Clemson University
[02:37:58.860 --> 02:38:02.020]  study on a bunch of their products and what it did to cancer cells.
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:06.660]  This isn't quack stuff. By the way, this isn't a cure cuz the cells just regrow somewhere
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:10.660]  else but it certainly puts a major dent in it. We're talking about 90 plus percent kill
[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:15.500]  rates on cancer cells of Beyond Tangy Tangerine and other products. Just go check it out.
[02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:20.580]  It is unbelievable. The AL International announces results of the longevity clinical research
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:26.920]  studies performed by Clemson University Institute of Nutritional Research. That is super prestigious.
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:31.260]  That's all linked. That study is linked. It was linked last week. Have them relink it
[02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:35.400]  right now on the front page of Infowarshealth.com. You can also find out how to be a distributor

[02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:09.540]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls quickly. Sean in Canada, what's your take on the huge
[02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:11.740]  Benghazi news that's unfolding?
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:16.860]  Well, it's just incredible, Alex. Like you said, like Colonel Shafer said and God bless
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:21.260]  him, Mabel Danger and coming out about that and 9-11, the guy's an amazing man, a true
[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:28.580]  patriot. And I always say, I'm rarely surprised these days, but I'm still always shocked and
[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:32.820]  I'm shocked at Hillary Clinton and the woman just looks like she has no soul. You look
[02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:38.460]  in the woman's eyes, it's just icy cold blue emptiness. And I just hope and pray that this
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:43.500]  time, this time it's gonna come out and they're gonna be found out for the criminals that
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:44.500]  they are.
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:45.500]  This is just unbelievable.
[02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:46.500]  Hello?
[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:53.300]  No, I'm just listening to you. And while you were telling me that, I turned my mic off
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:57.340]  to tell the guys, find the clip we've played of Hillary going, what difference does it
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:40:04.620]  make? And bashing her hands into the desk, what difference does it make? I mean, just
[02:40:04.620 --> 02:40:10.620]  absolutely outrageous to have this type of stuff going on, what difference does it make?
[02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:14.540]  And then you've got the other congressmen up there going, well, people die, that's just
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:19.820]  the way this is. See, when it's 20 kids, they hype it up to blame us for it. But when crime
[02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:25.220]  rates drop 49% because of guns, they don't wanna discuss it. Again, they wanna personalize
[02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:29.380]  that we killed those kids at Sandy Hook when hundreds of thousands have been saved the
[02:40:29.380 --> 02:40:37.000]  last 20 years, conservatively, in the government's own report, Firearms Violence 93 to 2011,
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:38.340]  out from the Justice Department.
[02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:42.780]  They finally crunched the numbers that we crunched months ago. We said a 49% drop in
[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:50.900]  violent crime, they have that number. A 69% in wounding shootings, a 39% in overall gun
[02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:57.140]  crime. And that's probably a whitewash, these are local numbers. They don't want anybody
[02:40:57.140 --> 02:41:01.180]  to know about this. They don't want you to know about this. And that's why I got mad
[02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:02.180]  at Anderson Cooper.
[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:07.500]  How dare you get up here and try to connect gun owners with the killing of these kids,
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:15.000]  you bastard, you piece of trash. I mean, that guilting us, that's collectivism. And arresting
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.800]  kids that bring a plastic butter knife to school their mom puts in their lunch box,
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:26.140]  or taking a valedictorian's degree away because they brought a butter knife to school.
[02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:29.020]  They're trying to turn us into, I'm sorry, I'm ranting, go ahead, sir.
[02:41:29.020 --> 02:41:35.420]  No, that's fine. I just couldn't believe, and I was reminded of the CPS guy long ago
[02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:38.940]  that came out and said, children will die. I mean, these people come out and say these
[02:41:38.940 --> 02:41:39.940]  absurd horrible things.
[02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:45.460]  Yeah, that was in Arkansas, they'd had two kids die in one week at one foster home. And
[02:41:45.460 --> 02:41:52.540]  he said, big deal, children will die. They can choose. It's disgusting. Anyway, and everybody,
[02:41:52.540 --> 02:41:57.260]  I hope there's as many cameras as possible in Washington for Independence Day to make
[02:41:57.260 --> 02:42:02.820]  sure nothing bad happens to Kokesh and that righteous movement. And just God bless you,
[02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:04.820]  keep up the good fight, and I'm gonna keep trying to wake up my friends.
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:09.660]  I got friends working on PhDs in political science in Oxford. They think I'm crazy, and
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:15.280]  I just keep trying to feed them information calmly and in small bursts so I don't overwhelm
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:17.180]  them and I'm plugging away, man.
[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:21.500]  Yeah, they've got them just studying mindless garbage there. God bless you, I appreciate
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:26.940]  your call. Absolutely good to hear from you. Let's talk to mankind in Arizona. You're on
[02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:27.940]  the air, sir.
[02:42:27.940 --> 02:42:30.940]  Hey, Alex, what's up? Can you hear me okay?
[02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:31.940]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:36.860]  All right. Yeah, I just wanted to say something about the Benghazi situation. And to all the
[02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:45.980]  listeners listening right now, this is it. This is a testament to how powerful our information
[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:53.100]  really actually is, because I'm sitting up here watching CNN all day, and I watched the
[02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:58.540]  testimony start, and as soon as the information started to pour out, they switched it real
[02:42:58.540 --> 02:43:05.020]  quick to the Jodi Arias and the three little girls that got kidnapped and all of that type
[02:43:05.020 --> 02:43:11.700]  of stuff, and they don't give them any sort of air time when this is the biggest information
[02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:15.860]  that should be concerning all Americans, as a matter of fact.
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:21.660]  And now Google is trying to keep people from going to mfoawars.com. Folks, we're hurting
[02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:28.500]  them, but we need everybody to send mfoawars.com and prisonplanet.com, and you can share your
[02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:33.700]  prisonplanet.tv memberships with up to 11 people. We need everybody to tune in because
[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:35.020]  I'm doing this to win it.
[02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:39.500]  I'm in it to win it, and that's why I get so much energy. That's why I get so upset,
[02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:44.220]  because I'm watching what you watch. I mean, I was watching an Internet feed, and I watched
[02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:48.940]  CNN. As soon as the guy starts going, and we were ordered to stand down, and they lied,
[02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:53.000]  and they have the security people there, and you could see the guy was risking his life
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.540]  doing that, telling the truth.
[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:58.900]  They cut to Anderson Cooper talking about gang violence with a package from last night,
[02:43:58.900 --> 02:44:02.340]  and the anchors go, we're cutting away for a moment with this. You can see they're all
[02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:09.100]  panicking. Look, the FBI told the mainstream media, don't look at other photos, don't look
[02:44:09.100 --> 02:44:14.660]  at drills, don't talk to Dan Badandi, don't go to mfoawars.com. And the entire media did
[02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:17.580]  what they were told and came out and attacked us.
[02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:22.060]  Now does that show you what a group, let me tell you something, the US military stood
[02:44:22.060 --> 02:44:27.980]  down when ordered to and watched all those people die, okay? But now they're not standing
[02:44:27.980 --> 02:44:32.300]  down, now they're telling the truth. That's the point. When you follow the orders of criminals,
[02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:35.300]  you don't follow orders that are illegal.
[02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:39.020]  If a cop comes to your door, hypothetically and said, line your kids up, we're gonna shoot
[02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:43.700]  them in the head, you have a right and a duty to resist them, okay? The government is not
[02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:49.620]  God. They say in 1984, two plus two equals four, if you can say that you're free. I say
[02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:52.500]  the government isn't God and it's the problem.
[02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:55.500]  I say if you can say that you're free, anything else mankind?
[02:44:55.500 --> 02:45:01.260]  Yeah, I just wanted to kind of further that and just really get all the listeners to know.
[02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:06.860]  I want everybody to get interactive cuz we are the most interactive and proactive listeners
[02:45:06.860 --> 02:45:11.420]  that there are. Let's get this information out because it's trying to be suppressed over
[02:45:11.420 --> 02:45:16.140]  the mainstream media, but we are the mainstream media as a matter of fact.
[02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:20.780]  And truth is always gonna come to light no matter what, so long as you do something about
[02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:21.780]  it.
[02:45:21.780 --> 02:45:26.780]  That's right. Truth always wins if you take action. It doesn't mean you're gonna survive,
[02:45:26.780 --> 02:45:30.140]  but it means your great grandkids are gonna have that Providence. Let me tell you the
[02:45:30.140 --> 02:45:35.820]  blessing that God gives families when people sacrifice that family for real causes is amazing.
[02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:39.180]  Give your family the blessing of a future. Even if they don't believe in the spiritual
[02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:41.660]  issues, it will give them a better future.
[02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:45.660]  Get up off your butts, folks. Don't just be spectators. Tell everybody you know about
[02:45:45.660 --> 02:45:51.420]  this. Tell them about the articles we've got. They have judges now ordering people to go
[02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:57.900]  to reeducation if they talk about conspiracy theories. I mean, it's just Twilight Zone,
[02:45:57.900 --> 02:46:04.300]  God bless you, mankind. We're gonna go to Ryan, and we're gonna go to Rich and another
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:06.100]  Ryan and Eric.
[02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:08.820]  Before the main broadcast ends, we'll be back tonight with the nightly news with all the
[02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:13.540]  info at seven o'clock central. But this is unbelievable. I can't believe I'm watching
[02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:17.420]  this happen. And let me tell you, if they get away with this now, caught, John Brown,
[02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:19.580]  you've been writing notes on what's breaking.
[02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:23.580]  You just tell them about the carjacking and then they pulled security off that. There
[02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:28.500]  was an order. Get these people. Don't let them get out of that compound. My God, because
[02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:34.060]  I guess they'd said no to giving the heat sinkers. That's what Madsen and that's what
[02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:36.980]  Pacinek think or what they say they know.
[02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:39.740]  And so they had to kill them all and still give the al-Qaeda the missiles. And that's
[02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:41.500]  probably what it is, 90% chance for it.
[02:46:41.500 --> 02:46:42.500]  It sure sounds like it.
[02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:44.620]  Yeah, yeah, so what do you got from the hearings?
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:52.420]  Well, so far, now we've gotten deeper into the information regarding the interviews with
[02:46:52.420 --> 02:46:59.180]  the ARB and the inner workings of the classified interviews. There was a lawyer that was thrown
[02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:03.660]  out that was basically a spy that was inside of this meeting. And as soon as the lawyer
[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:08.260]  was thrown out, then the State Department called and complained.
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:12.860]  They wanted somebody in there getting all this information that true American was speaking,
[02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:17.860]  by the way, to reveal what actually happened and I'm speaking-
[02:47:17.860 --> 02:47:19.260]  And they're threatening whistleblowers.
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:25.340]  Yeah, and speaking of threatening whistleblowers, they've gagged a fourth one with red tape
[02:47:25.340 --> 02:47:30.500]  and she has some key information. They didn't interview key people.
[02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:33.900]  What did the president know and when did he know it?
[02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:36.740]  We don't know that yet. It hasn't gotten that far yet.
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:39.100]  No, I know, but that's from Nixon, yeah.
[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:46.500]  Yeah, it's climbing into Hillary and you go back to that statement she made. What difference
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:51.820]  at this point does it make? Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out
[02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:56.140]  for a walk one night and decided they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point
[02:47:56.140 --> 02:47:57.280]  does it make?
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:00.680]  It's our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:05.260]  happening again. Well, they could have prevented the whole thing from happening in the first
[02:48:05.260 --> 02:48:12.820]  place and they know it. And they had something going on where they made sure that there was
[02:48:12.820 --> 02:48:16.620]  no security. There were carjackings of the people that were working there.
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:24.900]  They pulled that security detail off. They left them two guys underneath Ham's authority.
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:29.060]  And then there were another two guys that were there security detail and they don't
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:33.260]  even know whose authority they were under. So they had nobody and they're in the middle
[02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:39.380]  of a war zone. They're being carjacked. You add security detail.
[02:48:39.380 --> 02:48:44.260]  And by the way, guys, did we find the Hillary clip of what difference does it make? Okay,
[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:50.140]  we have that clip. The whole clip or just, all right, we'll isolate the part where she
[02:48:50.140 --> 02:48:53.620]  says that. I wanna play it the next time because I have a clip at six minutes long, but isolate
[02:48:53.620 --> 02:48:54.620]  that one.
[02:48:54.620 --> 02:48:58.780]  We have a one minute section. Let's play that. Play that as soon as you're ready. Okay, let's
[02:48:58.780 --> 02:49:03.980]  go ahead and go to Hillary. And then you've got Elijah Cummings saying people die. It's
[02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:08.540]  like you killed those 20 kids, America, turn your guns in. But then people die.
[02:49:08.540 --> 02:49:14.380]  Get used to it, America. Fall asleep. Lay down on the ground. Forget about your rights.
[02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:21.980]  Be a complete sheep, a total tool to this mafia that is in control of your destiny and
[02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:28.860]  your children's destiny. Wake up. Sorry. I was listening to NPR this morning cuz I turned
[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:29.860]  it on.
[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:34.620]  I wanna hear somebody talk about Benghazi cuz this was gonna happen today. And 30 minutes
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:39.980]  went by and they're talking about some rapper that got sexually assaulted. I even cared.
[02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:43.640]  Nobody cares about this. How long can you talk about something like that? But they're
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:47.460]  clearly not gonna talk about Benghazi, the key issues.
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:50.940]  Why are they buying millions of bullets, armored vehicles? Why are they saying veterans are
[02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:55.580]  the number one terrorist? I mean, we're in a Twilight Zone episode. And they're the bad
[02:49:55.580 --> 02:49:58.900]  guys. Let's go to this clip with Hillary. Here it is.
[02:49:58.900 --> 02:50:06.500]  I just wanna say that people have accused Ambassador Rice and the administration of
[02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:11.420]  misleading Americans. I can say trying to be in the middle of this and understanding
[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:17.620]  what was going on, nothing could be further from the truth. Was information developing?
[02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:23.620]  Was the situation fluid? Would we reach conclusions later that weren't reached initially? And
[02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:24.620]  I appreciate-
[02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:29.900]  Mr. Secretary, do you disagree with me that a simple phone call to those evacuees to determine
[02:50:29.900 --> 02:50:35.780]  what happened wouldn't have ascertained immediately that there was no protest? I mean, that was
[02:50:35.780 --> 02:50:40.820]  a piece of information that could have been easily, easily obtained within hours, if not
[02:50:40.820 --> 02:50:41.820]  days.
[02:50:41.820 --> 02:50:47.460]  Senator, when you're in these positions, the last thing you wanna do is interfere with
[02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:49.860]  any other process going on. Number one.
[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:51.860]  I realize that's a good excuse.
[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:56.860]  Number two, well, no, it's a fact. Number two, I would recommend highly you read-
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:50:58.580]  We're gonna come back with the actual clip.
[02:50:58.580 --> 02:50:59.580]  And the class of-
[02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:00.580]  We're gonna come back with the actual clip.
[02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:04.740]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:11.060]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:15.180]  requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[02:51:15.180 --> 02:51:17.820]  president could obtain this world class healer.
[02:51:17.820 --> 02:51:23.420]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:28.500]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[02:51:28.500 --> 02:51:33.640]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:38.220]  normal cell. If you wanna stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical
[02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:44.940]  immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VenusFly

[02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:05.580]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[02:52:05.580 --> 02:52:10.460]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When
[02:52:10.460 --> 02:52:15.740]  you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's

[02:54:13.220 --> 02:54:17.260]  Noah Webster said he would never surrender, a founding father, and he said before a standing
[02:54:17.260 --> 02:54:22.800]  army can rule, the people must be disarmed, Noah Webster. And when we try to send that
[02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:29.980]  meme photo painting of him with that text out on Facebook, they block it everywhere.
[02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:33.900]  And that's what the future web is going to be like. You're not going to be able to get
[02:54:33.900 --> 02:54:37.900]  to Infowars.com. We're not going to be able to use YouTube or Facebook. We're using it
[02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:42.900]  now against them. And they're going to block you going to our sites, so use them now against
[02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:46.740]  the enemy so they never get to that point. This is an occupational government. We're
[02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:50.700]  going to go into overdrive for at least 30 minutes in the next hour, some stations carry
[02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:51.700]  it.
[02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:56.620]  If not, audio and video feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show or Infowars.com forward
[02:54:56.620 --> 02:55:01.380]  slash listen. And at the end of the show today, we're going to email out to everybody that
[02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:07.540]  signed up at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter, the digital copy with live links and everything
[02:55:07.540 --> 02:55:13.060]  to the May issue of the magazine. It's been sent out once, but some of you didn't see
[02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:14.060]  it and have been asking for it.
[02:55:14.060 --> 02:55:18.260]  We're going to send it out this afternoon again. Everybody signed up to the free email
[02:55:18.260 --> 02:55:23.140]  newsletter alert area. We sent out exclusive videos, you name it, Infowars.com forward
[02:55:23.140 --> 02:55:29.740]  slash show. Or Infowars.com forward slash newsletter to sign up to get the magazine
[02:55:29.740 --> 02:55:35.180]  free. We're going to go into overdrive, take your calls. I'm going to get to everybody,
[02:55:35.180 --> 02:55:39.900]  but we were about five seconds too late because I went to the clip late.
[02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:44.660]  We led up to him questioning Hillary about what happened, and she said, hey, she said
[02:55:44.660 --> 02:55:48.060]  this is what she had to say about the dead people there. And now Cummings says people
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:51.740]  will die. This is just part of it. You know, big deal. Of course, he would squeal and beg
[02:55:51.740 --> 02:55:55.200]  for his little disgusting life. So let's go and go to this clip.
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:56:00.340]  With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:04.820]  or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?
[02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:07.140]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:56:07.140 --> 02:56:08.140]  You sent them to kill them.
[02:56:08.140 --> 02:56:12.500]  It's your job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from
[02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:17.820]  ever happening again, Senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions
[02:56:17.820 --> 02:56:18.820]  about this.
[02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:23.780]  Get her off the screen. Get her off the screen. See, they can't intimidate everybody. They
[02:56:23.780 --> 02:56:27.940]  can't shut us all up. You understand? We're not shutting up. John Bowne, you're going
[02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:32.620]  to be hosting his maiden voyage. We'll stick you right here in this seat, brother.
[02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:33.620]  Sounds good.
[02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:36.580]  I want you to go over everything you've researched. I'll go get more. I'll bring it in for an
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:40.820]  update at the end. And then tonight, Nightly News, you're going to be co-hosting with Rob
[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:41.820]  Dew.
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:42.820]  Yep.
[02:56:42.820 --> 02:56:45.620]  OK, and I'm going to shoot some other special reports, but this is just wild. Let's go to
[02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:50.220]  a phone call right now. Ryan in Michigan on Benghazi. Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:56:50.220 --> 02:56:51.220]  Hello?
[02:56:51.220 --> 02:56:53.700]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:54.700]  Alex?
[02:56:54.700 --> 02:56:55.700]  Yes, yes.
[02:56:55.700 --> 02:57:03.620]  I just want to say one thing right quick. There's three types of people out there. There's
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:10.340]  bronze-soled people, and they just want the fruits of life. You know, they just want to
[02:57:10.340 --> 02:57:18.060]  sit in their house, have a beer, and sit down. And then there's silver-soled people, and
[02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:26.620]  that's the warriors and fighters, OK? And then there's the golden-soled people out there,
[02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:33.740]  and that's the philosophers and thinkers and creators. And I think that's what our founding
[02:57:33.740 --> 02:57:40.380]  fathers were, and that's what we really need to strive to be, OK? And having said that...
[02:57:40.380 --> 02:57:43.900]  Now, let's say there's a lot of alloys, and then what group is evil? Do you have something
[02:57:43.900 --> 02:57:47.820]  to say about Benghazi? We're talking about Benghazi.
[02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:55.540]  Yeah, I don't see this Benghazi situation really changing anything, just because it's
[02:57:55.540 --> 02:57:59.300]  not in the people's face, and it's not going to change their lives.
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:02.140]  Listen, I disagree with you, and I appreciate your call. We're going to come back, take
[02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:06.100]  more calls, and Jon Bowne's going to take over for a couple of segments here, breaking
[02:58:06.100 --> 02:58:11.700]  down all the notes and articles he's got. The latest is all being updated at infoawards.com.
[02:58:11.700 --> 02:58:15.580]  Nothing will ever change if we don't believe it would. I'm not a crook. You know, we said,
[02:58:15.580 --> 02:58:19.740]  yeah, you are a crook. You've got to get angry about this, and you've got to point out there
[02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:20.740]  are a bunch of liars.
[02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:25.940]  The government thinks you're so dumb, they run Al-Qaeda. When the TSA wants to search,
[02:58:25.940 --> 02:58:31.100]  you go, man, knock it off. Government runs Al-Qaeda. You're probably with them. In fact,
[02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:35.580]  they even had a big study out last week that TSA is the greatest security threat. The government's
[02:58:35.580 --> 02:58:50.940]  the threat. They're the problem, to quote Ronald Reagan.

[02:59:52.340 --> 02:59:59.340]  The coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:22.340 --> 03:00:26.300]  My final segment here live, and John Ballen is going to take a few segments longer if
[03:00:26.300 --> 03:00:31.820]  he needs it, but Nightly News is coming up. He's going to be co-hosting that on Benghazi.
[03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:34.660]  I may just have to come in and host part of the news, too. I know you and Dew are already
[03:00:34.660 --> 03:00:39.060]  ready to do it, but this is so important. I'll probably shoot a video just commenting
[03:00:39.060 --> 03:00:45.660]  on the whole thing in general, but I want to take a few more calls, and John will continue
[03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:50.340]  with your calls as well after he covers some of the news and the updates on this.
[03:00:50.340 --> 03:00:55.860]  You got Elijah Cummings, we haven't played this clip yet, going, you know, life is part
[03:00:55.860 --> 03:01:00.940]  of, death is part of life, but life's also part of death. You got to get used to this.
[03:01:00.940 --> 03:01:06.060]  See, we only care about life when we say, when we're blaming you for a mass shooting
[03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:11.580]  of Prozac heads involved in, you need to take the blame for that. But only care when we
[03:01:11.580 --> 03:01:17.300]  say, you got how this works now? You got how this works? My life matters because I'm a
[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:20.500]  bucket of scum, corrupt globalist.
[03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:24.900]  Your life doesn't matter because you're a slave. And that's what's going on here. And
[03:01:24.900 --> 03:01:28.820]  Hillary's like, what difference does it make what killed people? Next time you murder somebody,
[03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:31.780]  just go, what difference does it make who killed him? Cops show up to your house, there's
[03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:35.500]  a dead body and go, they're like, well, what happened? Where were you? Are you involved?
[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:40.700]  What difference does it make? Well, this person's been stabbed to death. What difference does
[03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:49.100]  it make? Next time cops pull you over and you've had 15 drinks, you can hardly walk
[03:01:49.100 --> 03:01:53.600]  and they're like, all right, it looks like you're drunk, reckless driving here.
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:01:58.040]  What difference does it make? I'm gonna quote Hillary Clinton. And they're doing this more
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:04.620]  and more, John, where they just say, big deal. It's like the Travis County DA, totally drunk,
[03:02:04.620 --> 03:02:07.940]  out of her mind, driving the wrong way. And they're like, it's not a big deal and she
[03:02:07.940 --> 03:02:13.540]  does it? No, no, she's in charge. She's large and in charge. I think we ought to give her
[03:02:13.540 --> 03:02:18.580]  a red carpet. I think we should have human sacrifices every day to every government official
[03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:23.980]  like the Aztec said. We should pick a name out of a hat. Just have a daily sacrifice.
[03:02:23.980 --> 03:02:29.140]  We can put you on a jet pack like Logan's run and catapult you up in the air and then
[03:02:29.140 --> 03:02:33.820]  just have laser beams blow you away. Yeah, we could shot put people like in that Mel
[03:02:33.820 --> 03:02:38.100]  Brooks movie. Yeah, like it's good to be the king. The poor are revolting. They certainly
[03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:43.820]  are, sir. He goes, Paul, there's a shotgun as a poor person catapulted. I promise I'm
[03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:49.220]  gonna stay serious though. All right, Danny, you are Danny? I am, actually. Hello, Mr.
[03:02:49.220 --> 03:02:53.540]  Gopher. Let's jam in rich in Colorado. You're on the air. What do you make of this whole
[03:02:53.540 --> 03:02:59.220]  Benghazi? I think they may stage a false flag on us. What do you think? Well, you know what
[03:02:59.220 --> 03:03:01.980]  I was thinking when you said that the first thing that I thought about was they would
[03:03:01.980 --> 03:03:05.860]  divert our attention using the stock market, you know, maybe crashed market or something,
[03:03:05.860 --> 03:03:09.680]  you know, take it down. Everybody's all happy with the performance that's been taking place
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:15.820]  over the last several months. And, you know, it's that alone has diverted a lot of attention
[03:03:15.820 --> 03:03:21.360]  from things that have been taking place. And, you know, they have that trump card they can
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:26.100]  play at any time, whether they're going to play it now or not, I don't know. Another
[03:03:26.100 --> 03:03:29.980]  thing that was interesting. You talk about the mega ruthless banks. Bank of America came
[03:03:29.980 --> 03:03:34.260]  out and said they didn't have a single losing day the first quarter of this year, and they
[03:03:34.260 --> 03:03:39.260]  made over a hundred million dollars on seven days of the first quarter. Well, yeah, when
[03:03:39.260 --> 03:03:41.980]  you get hundreds of billions of dollars of tax money, it's everything's pretty good.
[03:03:41.980 --> 03:03:48.860]  Yeah, all that drug money. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, just just a thought. I, you know,
[03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:53.060]  I love these people are out of control. The issue is they're a bunch of crooks. They're
[03:03:53.060 --> 03:03:57.080]  out of control and they don't even cover their butt anymore. And then they just think they're
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:04:00.380]  going to have Homeland Security march around and declare us all terrorists when they're
[03:04:00.380 --> 03:04:01.380]  the terrorists.
[03:04:01.380 --> 03:04:05.620]  I mean, you guys run Al Qaeda next time I fly, man, I'm just going to, you know, tell
[03:04:05.620 --> 03:04:09.760]  them I'm like, I am sick of your crap. Treating me like I'm a suspect when your boss is carried
[03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:15.060]  out 9-11 Oklahoma City and everything else and Benghazi. Sorry. Go ahead, sir.
[03:04:15.060 --> 03:04:20.340]  Oh, no, I hear you. I hear you. You know, keep up the good work. It's great listening
[03:04:20.340 --> 03:04:26.660]  to you. And I've been a loyal listener for a couple of years now and I really enjoy it.

[03:07:03.320 --> 03:07:08.180]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts. They kicked in our door and
[03:07:08.180 --> 03:07:12.540]  were in and out of our house in about five minutes. The police arrived in about 20 minutes
[03:07:12.540 --> 03:07:18.540]  but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and my guns. I kept thinking, what if my family
[03:07:18.540 --> 03:07:24.200]  had been home? The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door
[03:07:24.200 --> 03:07:29.820]  and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders. The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net
[03:07:29.820 --> 03:07:34.740]  if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder. Easy Armor reinforces all
[03:07:34.740 --> 03:07:39.980]  of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins. I was surprised at how

[03:08:19.820 --> 03:08:39.060]  The
[03:08:39.060 --> 03:08:45.660]  Americans were killed in Benghazi, and even the mother of Smith, one of the folks that
[03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:50.600]  was killed in Benghazi, is saying that Hillary Clinton, she's pointing directly at Hillary
[03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:55.560]  Clinton and saying she is responsible, she's the one that killed my son.
[03:08:55.560 --> 03:08:57.460]  So why is she saying that?
[03:08:57.460 --> 03:09:04.300]  Well today we had Hicks, and we also had Nordstrom, and we had another gentleman named Thompson,
[03:09:04.300 --> 03:09:11.220]  and they were speaking with the group there investigating the entire debacle that happened
[03:09:11.220 --> 03:09:12.220]  in Benghazi.
[03:09:12.220 --> 03:09:22.800]  And Hicks was very forthcoming with the situation, having undergone immense reparations for his
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:30.860]  involvement with speaking the truth, and also undergoing a lot of, before the events happened,
[03:09:30.860 --> 03:09:33.600]  he was involved in a carjacking.
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:39.380]  And rather than adding security detail in order to make him safer, and to make the rest
[03:09:39.380 --> 03:09:43.820]  of them safer in Benghazi, they took detail away.
[03:09:43.820 --> 03:09:51.500]  And then once they were under attack, they called various locations, Africom, there was
[03:09:51.500 --> 03:09:58.060]  an outpost in Italy that could have sent F-14s out.
[03:09:58.060 --> 03:10:03.260]  And if an F-14 had been scrambled over the embassy, that would have told the Libyan terrorists
[03:10:03.260 --> 03:10:06.540]  that this is a no-go, we need to back off, we need to get out of here.
[03:10:06.540 --> 03:10:11.400]  All they needed was a plane to show up, to show that there was some kind of force that
[03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:14.700]  would be used to keep them away, but they couldn't even do that.
[03:10:14.700 --> 03:10:20.180]  They were told to stand down, and now more information is coming out, and it's slowly
[03:10:20.180 --> 03:10:29.040]  leading up to Ms. Hillary, which Clinton, which is very interesting, the word witch.
[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:34.180]  If you wanna research her roots of the occult, you're gonna find some interesting stuff as
[03:10:34.180 --> 03:10:35.180]  well.
[03:10:35.180 --> 03:10:44.580]  But side issue, Hillary is now gonna have to answer to these emails that have been declassified.
[03:10:44.580 --> 03:10:53.300]  And really, why would she go on the stand and say, what difference does it make?
[03:10:53.300 --> 03:10:56.740]  What difference does it make that people died, that four people died?
[03:10:56.740 --> 03:10:59.800]  Well, that's not exactly what she was saying, of course.
[03:10:59.800 --> 03:11:04.260]  But what difference does it make, the facts?
[03:11:04.260 --> 03:11:10.860]  What difference does it make that we have to look at the truth, that we have to investigate
[03:11:10.860 --> 03:11:12.180]  what went on?
[03:11:12.180 --> 03:11:14.340]  Who said stand down?
[03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:24.980]  Who said lessen the security detail, take away the troops there in Benghazi?
[03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:26.260]  What difference does it make?
[03:11:26.260 --> 03:11:32.900]  What difference does it make that years ago people died in her office, and she rifled
[03:11:32.900 --> 03:11:37.880]  through her desk just hours later and covered the entire thing up as well?
[03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:39.980]  What difference does it make?
[03:11:39.980 --> 03:11:42.860]  She's in charge, she's large and in charge.
[03:11:42.860 --> 03:11:47.900]  So that's the only difference that anything makes, is that Hillary Clinton is in charge.
[03:11:47.900 --> 03:11:56.620]  So let's take a look at some of these headlines as the stabilized situation through their
[03:11:56.620 --> 03:12:00.500]  lies and deception slowly crumbles in front of them.
[03:12:00.500 --> 03:12:03.140]  In context, Hillary Clinton, what difference does it make?
[03:12:03.140 --> 03:12:06.340]  Comment is now coming to the fore.
[03:12:06.340 --> 03:12:11.340]  Mail online is saying Dick Cheney slams Obama administration's Benghazi performance as a
[03:12:11.340 --> 03:12:16.580]  failure of leadership, and he can't understand why they weren't ready.
[03:12:16.580 --> 03:12:19.220]  Folks, that's what it comes down to.
[03:12:19.220 --> 03:12:27.300]  I think the past few months we've all looked at, we've seen Benghazi on TV and it's been
[03:12:27.300 --> 03:12:34.340]  kind of a foreign, it happened in a different country.
[03:12:34.340 --> 03:12:39.620]  The details aren't that clear.
[03:12:39.620 --> 03:12:45.700]  What's the deal with Rice saying that it may have been a protest and was it a terrorist
[03:12:45.700 --> 03:12:46.700]  act?
[03:12:46.700 --> 03:12:47.700]  Is that really important?
[03:12:47.700 --> 03:12:48.980]  What's the difference, right?
[03:12:48.980 --> 03:12:55.020]  Well, the difference is that there were people with key information that were told to stand
[03:12:55.020 --> 03:12:59.780]  down, they were told not to report what they knew.
[03:12:59.780 --> 03:13:07.940]  And there was a lot of information behind the scenes that happened before the event
[03:13:07.940 --> 03:13:11.520]  even occurred that is now coming to light.
[03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:17.900]  We have Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings making this bizarre statement about death
[03:13:17.900 --> 03:13:21.240]  is a part of life and life is a part of death.
[03:13:21.240 --> 03:13:26.260]  And this culture, this death culture that we're living in now, where we have all these
[03:13:26.260 --> 03:13:33.580]  false flag attacks on our own children here in the United States, in movie theaters, this
[03:13:33.580 --> 03:13:38.940]  false flag culture that we live in, that now death is a part of life.
[03:13:38.940 --> 03:13:41.500]  Life is a part of death.
[03:13:41.500 --> 03:13:43.500]  So get used to it.
[03:13:43.500 --> 03:13:49.340]  Just continue to look at that flickering rate on your TV screen and get used to it.
[03:13:49.340 --> 03:13:52.380]  Just fall asleep.
[03:13:52.380 --> 03:13:59.940]  Okay, we have to protect our fellow employees, said a Democratic Congressman, the Benghazi
[03:13:59.940 --> 03:14:03.180]  whistleblower, chokes Nordstrom.
[03:14:03.180 --> 03:14:09.500]  Yeah, well, actually it says he didn't choke, he choked up.
[03:14:09.500 --> 03:14:13.480]  They were incredibly affected by this cuz they're in the middle of it and an interesting
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:19.580]  part of this testimony today was the fact that a lot of the representatives that were
[03:14:19.580 --> 03:14:28.880]  interviewing Nordstrom and Hicks had experienced similar detail themselves in other countries.
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:34.460]  So they knew the situation.
[03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:36.180]  Let's take a caller.
[03:14:36.180 --> 03:14:41.860]  Let's go to, what is this, Dean in California, is that right?
[03:14:41.860 --> 03:14:42.860]  Yes, hello?
[03:14:42.860 --> 03:14:44.860]  Hey, Dean, how's it going?
[03:14:44.860 --> 03:14:48.140]  This is John Bowne filling in for Alex Jones today.
[03:14:48.140 --> 03:14:53.820]  John, just great, congratulations on sitting in the big chair, been watching for a couple
[03:14:53.820 --> 03:14:54.820]  of years now.
[03:14:54.820 --> 03:15:00.980]  I've been watching the hearings all morning and it's kind of confusing.
[03:15:00.980 --> 03:15:06.020]  I'm watching Mr. Nordstrom and Mr. Hicks talk and it seems like they say everything up to
[03:15:06.020 --> 03:15:11.260]  the point of actually making a direct accusation of who was responsible other than at a certain
[03:15:11.260 --> 03:15:18.620]  level responsibility is above somebody and above and it seems like some of the people
[03:15:18.620 --> 03:15:27.020]  doing the questioning are, I don't know, less than enthusiastic about actually getting to
[03:15:27.020 --> 03:15:28.020]  the truth.
[03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:34.340]  So it's been an interesting watch because occasionally they'll say something that should
[03:15:34.340 --> 03:15:41.180]  be a bombshell but because it seems like such a stilted, kind of dry question and answer,
[03:15:41.180 --> 03:15:44.460]  it kind of slips under the radar.
[03:15:44.460 --> 03:15:49.660]  When they ask Mr. Nordstrom, okay, when you go into an embassy there has to be a sign
[03:15:49.660 --> 03:15:55.420]  off for it to be legal or there's a legal set of guidelines as to when a building can
[03:15:55.420 --> 03:15:57.540]  be occupied and who has to sign off on that?
[03:15:57.540 --> 03:16:02.020]  Well, the Secretary of State, which would be Hillary Clinton, they just kind of breezed
[03:16:02.020 --> 03:16:03.020]  right over that.
[03:16:03.020 --> 03:16:04.820]  It's just been very interesting watching.
[03:16:04.820 --> 03:16:08.740]  Well, yeah, I think they're setting it up for more testimony, they're going to roll
[03:16:08.740 --> 03:16:14.680]  out even more whistleblowers supposedly the next week or so.
[03:16:14.680 --> 03:16:19.280]  So hopefully this evidence, because there were a lot of, it is a bit confusing because
[03:16:19.280 --> 03:16:25.500]  there were statements, I don't know if you noticed, one of the representative was saying
[03:16:25.500 --> 03:16:29.460]  that there was a statement made and then they weren't sure if that statement was made at
[03:16:29.460 --> 03:16:35.340]  all and then they had to go check the records and then Mr. Hicks hasn't been able to get
[03:16:35.340 --> 03:16:38.420]  to all of the records of his testimony.
[03:16:38.420 --> 03:16:42.900]  So they said you made the statement here and he said, well, I don't recollect making that
[03:16:42.900 --> 03:16:43.900]  statement there.
[03:16:43.900 --> 03:16:49.260]  So yeah, it is a bit confusing, but I think they're chipping away at a big stone.
[03:16:49.260 --> 03:16:55.500]  But the evidence that we need is what was in that embassy?
[03:16:55.500 --> 03:17:05.800]  What did Stevens have as far as his information on the weapons that they may have had?
[03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:14.660]  And also the financial information regarding Libya that they may have had because the United
[03:17:14.660 --> 03:17:19.500]  Nations is heavily involved in this whole process in the Middle East.
[03:17:19.500 --> 03:17:28.760]  So really this is a cover up here in America as we turn on the news and we see the coverage
[03:17:28.760 --> 03:17:34.200]  of the girls that were finally rescued in Cleveland and then there's a big story now
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:36.960]  about some murder trial.
[03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:42.600]  And that's what interests the American public are these human stories, but it's not the
[03:17:42.600 --> 03:17:47.680]  political stories that really interest anybody anymore because they've spent so much time
[03:17:47.680 --> 03:17:54.080]  and so much money on making sure that we ignore the political side of things.
[03:17:54.080 --> 03:18:02.260]  That here we have a bona fide mega Watergate situation in our day right now.
[03:18:02.260 --> 03:18:06.780]  This makes Watergate look like Cub Scouts.
[03:18:06.780 --> 03:18:07.780]  That was nothing.
[03:18:07.780 --> 03:18:08.780]  I am not a crook.
[03:18:08.780 --> 03:18:11.540]  All right, we'll take a hike.
[03:18:11.540 --> 03:18:17.340]  Well, there's a lot of people up there on Capitol Hill that need to take a hike for
[03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:19.820]  a lot of good reasons.
[03:18:19.820 --> 03:18:21.820]  Anything else, caller?
[03:18:21.820 --> 03:18:27.260]  Well, I've noticed I've been following the Clintons for quite a long time and there was
[03:18:27.260 --> 03:18:32.780]  actually an interesting documentary that was put together some years ago and it was basically
[03:18:32.780 --> 03:18:37.580]  about how bad it was for your health to be associated with the Clintons over time, whether
[03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:42.260]  it was through disagreement or just political expediency.
[03:18:42.260 --> 03:18:46.500]  At the end of the video, as they documented throughout the course of it, something like
[03:18:46.500 --> 03:18:53.940]  24, 36, 40, I don't remember the exact number of people, ended up dying by, for lack of
[03:18:53.940 --> 03:18:58.940]  a better term, a honey accident that were direct confidants, friends, whatever you want
[03:18:58.940 --> 03:19:01.100]  to call them, of the Clintons.
[03:19:01.100 --> 03:19:08.900]  It seems that any time your political expediency is needed, it's really bad for anybody's health
[03:19:08.900 --> 03:19:11.300]  that's involved, in this case four people in Benghazi.
[03:19:11.300 --> 03:19:14.300]  Yeah, there are a lot of people that have died around the Clintons.
[03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:19.900]  I think the worst one that I'm aware of are the kids that died at the railroad track after
[03:19:19.900 --> 03:19:22.980]  having seen the drug shipments come in for Bill Clinton.
[03:19:22.980 --> 03:19:27.740]  Really amazing is at the end of the video that I saw of a documentary, the filmmaker
[03:19:27.740 --> 03:19:33.060]  died like a week after he completed it of similar causes to so many others.
[03:19:33.060 --> 03:19:37.820]  Hey, death's a part of life and life's a part of death and when it comes to the Clintons,
[03:19:37.820 --> 03:19:39.500]  that is probably their motto.
[03:19:39.500 --> 03:19:43.860]  That's probably hanging on their wall and Cummings was just in there having a drink.
[03:19:43.860 --> 03:19:48.500]  We'll be right back after this break, but we'll take more calls and we'll look at Benghazi
[03:19:48.500 --> 03:19:51.820]  and we'll look at some of the other headlines here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:51.820 --> 03:19:53.740]  I'm John Baum filling in.
[03:19:53.740 --> 03:19:57.140]  And remember, you're a human being.

[03:22:40.220 --> 03:22:43.300]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[03:22:43.300 --> 03:22:46.620]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[03:24:06.220 --> 03:24:14.460]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:14.460 --> 03:24:19.740]  Local Representative Elijah Cummings from Maryland, Democrat of Maryland, said it best.
[03:24:19.740 --> 03:24:25.860]  He said it very cogently, death is a part of life.
[03:24:25.860 --> 03:24:27.960]  Life is a part of death.
[03:24:27.960 --> 03:24:34.140]  And here we live in this culture of death where we actually, our entertainment now is
[03:24:34.140 --> 03:24:35.140]  death.
[03:24:35.140 --> 03:24:39.260]  We used to live in an ethical society where people gave you the shirt off their back,
[03:24:39.260 --> 03:24:40.860]  tried to help you out.
[03:24:40.860 --> 03:24:45.860]  We had a war effort where everyone banded together, gave up their small businesses to
[03:24:45.860 --> 03:24:47.600]  defend America.
[03:24:47.600 --> 03:24:50.000]  And now who's defending America?
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:25:00.380]  Some shadow government called the United Nations on the offense against America with an elite
[03:25:00.380 --> 03:25:06.700]  troop called Al Qaeda that is completely commanded by our Commander in Chief, who will be here
[03:25:06.700 --> 03:25:09.500]  in Austin tomorrow, by the way.
[03:25:09.500 --> 03:25:13.700]  There's a, just to give you an example of the culture of death that we live in and,
[03:25:13.700 --> 03:25:16.300]  you know, let's, let's, let's do a little test here.
[03:25:16.300 --> 03:25:21.660]  I'm going to read this headline and let's see how much it affects you because it affects
[03:25:21.660 --> 03:25:23.020]  me.
[03:25:23.020 --> 03:25:27.220]  It makes me sick to my stomach and it should make you sick to your stomach.
[03:25:27.220 --> 03:25:28.580]  But this is the culture of death.
[03:25:28.580 --> 03:25:30.780]  All right, here's the headline.
[03:25:30.780 --> 03:25:39.420]  Life news.com, ironically enough, late term abortion doc caught comparing unborn baby
[03:25:39.420 --> 03:25:41.860]  to meat in a crock pot.
[03:25:41.860 --> 03:25:49.940]  Now this late term abortion doc back in the day would have had the tar beat out of him.
[03:25:49.940 --> 03:25:55.300]  He would have been tarred and feathered and taken down to the square and, you know, would
[03:25:55.300 --> 03:25:58.640]  have had to have answered for saying something like this.
[03:25:58.640 --> 03:26:05.820]  But now it's just another headline in our culture of death or ongoing culture of death.
[03:26:05.820 --> 03:26:11.500]  You know, here's, here's John Bolton shifting gears a little bit here.
[03:26:11.500 --> 03:26:15.420]  Here's John Bolton saying that Benghazi could bring down the Obama administration.
[03:26:15.420 --> 03:26:23.980]  Well, you think, don't you think it's time for the Obama administration to go down?
[03:26:23.980 --> 03:26:29.700]  We've got the NDAA, which says that he can come here and take me out anytime he wants.
[03:26:29.700 --> 03:26:35.380]  We've got drones being put in the skies by this culture of death government.
[03:26:35.380 --> 03:26:39.740]  We have spokesman out there right in the middle of a hearing saying that death is a part of
[03:26:39.740 --> 03:26:40.740]  life.
[03:26:40.740 --> 03:26:43.380]  Life is a part of death.
[03:26:43.380 --> 03:26:44.740]  We've endured 9-11.
[03:26:44.740 --> 03:26:46.220]  We've endured Sandy Hook.
[03:26:46.220 --> 03:26:49.860]  We've endured Aurora.
[03:26:49.860 --> 03:26:52.060]  Just to mention a few.
[03:26:52.060 --> 03:26:53.180]  It's been a whirlwind.
[03:26:53.180 --> 03:26:57.900]  It's been a rollercoaster past few years and a culture of death.
[03:26:57.900 --> 03:27:03.140]  Let's take some more calls regarding the culture of death.
[03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:04.580]  Here is what do we have?
[03:27:04.580 --> 03:27:06.580]  Eric in Tennessee.
[03:27:06.580 --> 03:27:07.580]  Yes.
[03:27:07.580 --> 03:27:09.900]  Hey, go ahead, Eric.
[03:27:09.900 --> 03:27:13.380]  What do you, what do you, what's on your mind?
[03:27:13.380 --> 03:27:15.180]  I'm mad as hell.
[03:27:15.180 --> 03:27:16.820]  And you're not going to take it anymore.
[03:27:16.820 --> 03:27:18.460]  I am not going to take it anymore.
[03:27:18.460 --> 03:27:20.500]  You remember the twisted sister song?
[03:27:20.500 --> 03:27:21.500]  Yeah.
[03:27:21.500 --> 03:27:22.500]  I'm not going to take it.
[03:27:22.500 --> 03:27:23.500]  Actually.
[03:27:23.500 --> 03:27:29.140]  Uh, actually, uh, my wedding anniversary is the 4th of July, uh, chose to get married
[03:27:29.140 --> 03:27:30.140]  on the 4th of July.
[03:27:30.140 --> 03:27:31.980]  I mean, it's a special day for me.
[03:27:31.980 --> 03:27:32.980]  Absolutely.
[03:27:32.980 --> 03:27:34.860]  You married the country simultaneously.
[03:27:34.860 --> 03:27:35.860]  Absolutely.
[03:27:35.860 --> 03:27:36.860]  Absolutely.
[03:27:36.860 --> 03:27:41.340]  Of course, I want to wish my wife a happy anniversary.
[03:27:41.340 --> 03:27:42.340]  She's going with me.
[03:27:42.340 --> 03:27:43.340]  We're going to DC.
[03:27:43.340 --> 03:27:44.940]  We're going to walk across that bridge.
[03:27:44.940 --> 03:27:50.020]  Well, God love you and God bless you and, uh, may Providence look over you.
[03:27:50.020 --> 03:27:51.020]  Thank you, brother.
[03:27:51.020 --> 03:27:56.580]  Now, as far as, uh, the headlines go, I mean, I'm literally shaking at this point from everything
[03:27:56.580 --> 03:27:57.580]  that's going on today.
[03:27:57.580 --> 03:28:06.180]  Uh, ever since I started listening to Alex, it's been, uh, an awakening is the word that
[03:28:06.180 --> 03:28:13.180]  everybody uses, but it's more like, um, and angering, shaking, being shaken awake from
[03:28:13.180 --> 03:28:19.260]  a nightmare, you know, and realizing that the nightmare is real.
[03:28:19.260 --> 03:28:24.180]  You know, like, uh, it's like dreaming that your house was on fire and waking up and it's
[03:28:24.180 --> 03:28:25.740]  actually on fire.
[03:28:25.740 --> 03:28:26.740]  You know?
[03:28:26.740 --> 03:28:27.740]  Yeah.
[03:28:27.740 --> 03:28:28.740]  Yeah.
[03:28:28.740 --> 03:28:29.740]  Very good analogy.
[03:28:29.740 --> 03:28:32.340]  Hillary Clinton, man.
[03:28:32.340 --> 03:28:37.260]  I think every, you know, when you're talking about giving her a red carpet, I think we
[03:28:37.260 --> 03:28:39.620]  should get her a blue dress every day.
[03:28:39.620 --> 03:28:41.820]  Why is that?
[03:28:41.820 --> 03:28:44.300]  Just the blue dress, the Monica dress.
[03:28:44.300 --> 03:28:45.300]  Oh yeah.
[03:28:45.300 --> 03:28:46.300]  Yeah.
[03:28:46.300 --> 03:28:47.300]  Yeah.
[03:28:47.300 --> 03:28:49.180]  Just so she can remember a little bit of pain every day.
[03:28:49.180 --> 03:28:51.620]  She'll feel something at that point.
[03:28:51.620 --> 03:28:53.020]  When you look in her eyes, she's dead.
[03:28:53.020 --> 03:28:54.780]  I mean, there's nothing there.
[03:28:54.780 --> 03:28:58.140]  Well, and that's, that's what we see as Americans.
[03:28:58.140 --> 03:29:07.020]  When we see Hillary Clinton, we see this facade of this political wife who's risen from poverty,
[03:29:07.020 --> 03:29:10.100]  you know, into this, into this world atmosphere.
[03:29:10.100 --> 03:29:14.780]  And she's doing this great American deed by, you know, doing what she does.
[03:29:14.780 --> 03:29:21.500]  But there is beyond a dark side to Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.
[03:29:21.500 --> 03:29:24.680]  It's Jeffrey Dahmer level stuff.
[03:29:24.680 --> 03:29:29.420]  And those are the people that are Jeffrey Dahmer is running our country.
[03:29:29.420 --> 03:29:31.380]  Now, what if I said that?
[03:29:31.380 --> 03:29:33.580]  Would that shock you, America?
[03:29:33.580 --> 03:29:36.340]  That Jeffrey Dahmer is running our country?
[03:29:36.340 --> 03:29:39.300]  Because that's what we're talking about.
[03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:41.360]  Is that okay with you?
[03:29:41.360 --> 03:29:45.820]  That Jeffrey Dahmer is running our country.
[03:29:45.820 --> 03:29:46.820]  How's that feel?
[03:29:46.820 --> 03:30:16.580]  I'm President Dahmer.
