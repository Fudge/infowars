[00:00.000 --> 00:14.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.840 --> 00:26.120]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I'm going to be as calm as I
[00:26.120 --> 00:34.400]  can we are live it is 11 a.m. Central Standard Time Thursday the 14th day of August 2014 by
[00:34.400 --> 00:42.240]  reporters Josh Owens, Jacarie Jackson and Joe Biggs were attacked with tear gas flashbangs
[00:42.240 --> 00:48.600]  and rubber bullets last night in Ferguson Missouri that has been federalized and is
[00:48.600 --> 00:58.600]  being monitored by the United Nations if you understand psychological warfare it's
[00:58.600 --> 01:05.760]  clear the feds are trying to escalate this as much as they can to start riots all over the
[01:05.760 --> 01:14.480]  country the media is billing this as a citizen against the cops and that if anybody is against
[01:14.480 --> 01:21.320]  the first amendment being abandoned that they are just anti-police and are pro thugs with their
[01:21.320 --> 01:27.400]  drawers hanging down over their butts burning down buildings no that happened back on Sunday
[01:27.400 --> 01:35.800]  and Saturday night that's not happening now our reporters went in there with an open mind
[01:35.800 --> 01:44.320]  Jacarie Jackson was going to college for RTF and criminology his whole family is extremely
[01:44.320 --> 01:50.760]  conservative when it comes to things like the police and Jacarie has told me that it's just
[01:50.760 --> 01:56.120]  outrageous what's going on so has Joe Biggs who's a combat veteran multiple tours in Iraq and
[01:56.120 --> 02:02.680]  Afghanistan and a war hero written up in Rolling Stone and Esquire so he went in there with an
[02:02.680 --> 02:10.120]  open mind he doesn't hate police a lot of his friends are cops this is outrageous on so many
[02:10.120 --> 02:13.920]  fronts how they're trying to spend it there is video we're going to play here in a moment for
[02:13.920 --> 02:19.680]  TV viewers for radio listeners it's up on info wars.com with our own video of it we don't just
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.360]  have the video like Al Jazeera has we have the audio of an Al Jazeera crew with big cameras
[02:24.360 --> 02:30.480]  lights doing their news report being fired at with tear gas and rubber bullets you see Jacarie
[02:30.480 --> 02:42.080]  behind them running away in the video and then the SWAT team runs up and dismantles they fire
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.200]  tear gas at them then as they run rubber bullets were then fired the media doesn't even have that
[02:47.200 --> 02:55.160]  part Jacarie was there Biggs was hit and then they run up and tear the cameras apart so mainline
[02:55.160 --> 03:10.640]  TV crews folks who are 500 yards away or more are being attacked and I couldn't tweet last night we
[03:10.640 --> 03:15.680]  went and did a test Kit Daniels did set up a new Twitter sent out the Joe Biggs video the live feed
[03:15.680 --> 03:23.000]  they suspended the account turned it back on in the morning they are wargaming and psyopping the
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.760]  internet and the cops on the ground don't even know this so I'm not the enemy of the police who
[03:27.760 --> 03:33.160]  are being given this information but it's now been federalized the county the city state police
[03:33.160 --> 03:38.280]  and feds just like Katrina where they use it for gun confiscation and people denied that at the
[03:38.280 --> 03:47.440]  time later confirmed this is a psyop this is a psyop look at the sheriff's department federalized
[03:47.440 --> 03:53.360]  with men where they are 15s aiming them at the press after they shoot them with rubber bullets
[03:53.360 --> 04:01.520]  this keeps happening people are going to start you know what I'm back and it is going to turn
[04:01.520 --> 04:07.320]  into a civil war the police are being told you know dominate maintain control shut down the press
[04:07.320 --> 04:12.880]  and you know we'll keep this under control well statistically this will have the opposite effect
[04:12.880 --> 04:20.480]  if we're lucky this won't blow up but the intent by the feds with the federalization I mean people
[04:20.480 --> 04:27.880]  think it's an archetypal image of UC Davis with the head cop spraying kids and handcuffs with
[04:27.880 --> 04:35.720]  gallons of pepper spray no no no no what's archetypal is is paramilitary police shooting
[04:35.720 --> 04:40.520]  reporters with rubber bullets and tear gas running up and dismantling the camera the
[04:40.520 --> 04:48.880]  military attacking the press in America attacking cameras this is the new image make no mistake
[04:48.880 --> 04:55.880]  artists you name it are going to expose this and this this all integrates with the open borders
[04:55.880 --> 05:01.800]  and the rest of it will break it down coming up the government's department of homeland security
[05:01.800 --> 05:06.280]  is buying up loads of ammo at the same time they're restricting civilians rights to own
[05:06.280 --> 05:11.840]  and purchase firearms can you put two and two together infidel body armor can stop every round

[08:14.640 --> 08:25.680]  in defense of human liberty it's alex jones ladies and gentlemen we have talked a lot here
[08:25.680 --> 08:34.080]  on the air about the season of crisis the time of great turmoil that we're now entering that will
[08:34.080 --> 08:42.480]  only intensify in the days months and years to come and i'm afraid only become more insane
[08:42.480 --> 08:50.880]  as the technological quickening towards the technotronic era accelerates towards what the
[08:50.880 --> 08:58.720]  globalists call the singularity i want to be scientific today in the breakdown of what's
[08:58.720 --> 09:04.640]  happening in fergus in missouri with the backdrop of the globalist destabilization worldwide
[09:04.640 --> 09:14.480]  we know that the summer is the time of rage historically the time of the riot we know this
[09:14.480 --> 09:24.560]  country in most areas is in a depression especially in the rust belt we live in an occupied nation
[09:24.560 --> 09:30.080]  run by foreign offshore banks that have levied obama care against us that attacks every man
[09:30.080 --> 09:36.880]  woman and child regardless of race color or creed we know we've been signed on to a thousand
[09:36.880 --> 09:43.280]  five hundred trillion dollars of fake derivatives hundreds of times what the nation could ever pay
[09:43.280 --> 09:49.280]  back and it's not our debt we know our government is illegitimate funding al-qaeda worldwide we know
[09:49.280 --> 09:55.040]  the nsa is being used to spy on political enemies and for social control and to corner the stock
[09:55.040 --> 10:03.920]  market and rig the economy to consolidate power we know the government has a seven percent approval
[10:03.920 --> 10:12.000]  rating in gallup a six percent approval rating in pew research the mainstream media has a 13
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.400]  percent approval rating on average in gallup and a little bit lower in pew the system is a fraud
[10:20.400 --> 10:27.200]  is illegitimate and it wants to get americans fighting with americans black against white
[10:27.920 --> 10:34.720]  hispanic against white and black and vice versa man against woman woman against man
[10:34.720 --> 10:43.520]  kids against their parents north against south east against west farmer against shopkeeper
[10:43.520 --> 10:51.760]  cop against citizen police it's time to wake up and understand the scyop that's being run here
[10:52.480 --> 10:59.200]  if i come out and simply decry what the police are doing it will fit into the globalist paradigm
[10:59.920 --> 11:07.280]  i do decry what they've done but with the provisos that we understand the larger picture here
[11:07.280 --> 11:16.480]  there is no debate about what's happening i've told you the age of the contrived the orchestrated
[11:17.280 --> 11:25.840]  but also the allowed and there's an exacerbated crisis is now here don't let a good crisis go to
[11:25.840 --> 11:34.160]  waste rama manual to the wall street journal five years ago do i think they went and shot this innocent
[11:34.160 --> 11:39.040]  black guy with his hands up in front of a bunch of people to start this whole thing going probably
[11:39.040 --> 11:45.840]  not but are the feds coming in with their training over the years and now federalizing this operation
[11:45.840 --> 11:52.160]  and escalating it to try to make the crisis worse and to try to set the precedent of
[11:52.160 --> 11:58.720]  martial law in this country just like they did with the boston bombing searching half the houses in
[11:58.720 --> 12:03.600]  the city without warrants throwing men women and children around who look nothing like the
[12:03.600 --> 12:13.040]  suspect absolutely the militarization of police the mraps the helicopters the military training
[12:13.040 --> 12:19.600]  the illegal surveillance the threat fusion centers dialed into illegal nsa tracking all of this is
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.920]  of the twisting and the corruption and the federalization of our police it is the seduction of them
[12:27.920 --> 12:34.800]  into their new mission which i told you would be used against muslims first because they were the
[12:34.800 --> 12:42.960]  most unpopular group then against blacks then against hispanics and then the main enemy
[12:44.160 --> 12:51.920]  gun owners returning veterans libertarians conservatives christians anti-abortion activists
[12:51.920 --> 13:00.080]  and white people you notice now they're segueing into the war on whites while they then set
[13:00.080 --> 13:07.200]  precedence on a mainly black neighborhood manipulating underlying white racism that does exist in
[13:07.200 --> 13:13.440]  some quarters i see the comments on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and on youtube a lot
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.520]  of them are bots we're able to track them on info wars and know they're artificial but some of
[13:17.520 --> 13:24.240]  them are real saying why are you out there helping monkeys why are you out there with the inwards
[13:26.240 --> 13:33.520]  well number one those are human beings number two this is a larger psiop number three what is allowed
[13:33.520 --> 13:42.560]  to be done against what is seen as the least of us will then be done against all of us as christ said
[13:42.560 --> 13:47.440]  what you do to the children you do to me what you do to the poor you do to me what you do to groups
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.280]  that have a bunch of you know gangbangers out of the you know batteries of st louis sing let's go
[13:53.280 --> 13:57.600]  riot because they shot this black guy they go into some semi-rural area mainly with a bunch of
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.280]  old black retirees out there that have worked their butts off their whole lives and then they
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.360]  sit there and burned out a few buildings and then we send reporters there to find out what's
[14:07.360 --> 14:14.000]  really going on and i was getting criticism for saying well people are burning stuff the police
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.600]  have got to maintain order then the fed show up and say attack reporters and start tear gassing
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.480]  and rubber bulletin reporters and i say that's wrong i'd say it was wrong if they were black or
[14:24.480 --> 14:30.160]  if they were white or if they were blue let me tell you big is blue from those rubber bullets now
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.400]  because i stand for justice i stand for what's right because that's what makes me feel
[14:36.400 --> 14:44.400]  good in my gut when i do wrong i feel bad when i do the right thing and tell the truth i feel good
[14:44.400 --> 14:50.240]  i feel right with god when i start even thinking about doing something wrong that fear of god creeps
[14:50.240 --> 14:57.920]  in ladies and gentlemen and that's why this country is so screwed up because people aren't god-fearing
[14:58.560 --> 15:02.480]  and i don't mean you're going to find god one of these fake churches anybody who's god-fearing
[15:02.480 --> 15:10.480]  knows what i'm talking about you want justice you want prosperity you want to help people you
[15:10.480 --> 15:17.200]  want to build things up and they use the ignorance of god-fearing people to support open borders and
[15:17.200 --> 15:22.240]  saying it's for the kids that's part of a larger globalist plan that's why i'm against it not because
[15:22.240 --> 15:28.080]  i'm against those kids fleeing guatemala one of the greatest hell holes on earth they're not bringing
[15:28.080 --> 15:33.840]  them here to save them they're bringing them here to bring the country down and i've supported the
[15:33.840 --> 15:40.320]  board of patrol a constitutional agency under attack when police are in the right i support them
[15:40.320 --> 15:45.760]  when they're in the wrong i don't and i studied this for 22 years and i know what i'm talking about
[15:45.760 --> 15:52.640]  we got joe biggs jacarrey jackson and josh owens all there we got tear gas flashbang and shot with
[15:52.640 --> 15:58.400]  rubber bullets biggs got shot with rubber bullets the others got hit with everything but that but
[15:58.400 --> 16:03.840]  the larger system you got to pull back if you're a black racist and and i got to say stop being a
[16:03.840 --> 16:09.760]  mindless idiot being manipulated by tribalism you got to pull back if you're a white racist and see
[16:09.760 --> 16:15.200]  the larger manipulation and not be a mindless primitive you got to scientifically see the
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.240]  battle space for what it is if you're a cop all hopped up in mob mentality tired of getting
[16:20.240 --> 16:24.640]  being yelled at for three days because you're telling folks to back off and pointing guns at
[16:24.640 --> 16:30.480]  them take cops when you point lasers at innocent people with their hands up 70 80 meters away
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.480]  almost a hundred yards away they start yelling at you and getting angry
[16:42.960 --> 16:48.880]  when you shoot reporters with tear gas and rubber bullets like algezera and point laser dots on
[16:48.880 --> 16:57.440]  laser dots on algezera you cause the same situation and that's what i said what they're doing according
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.240]  to listen the military when they want to stir people up they send in troops with orders to do
[17:02.240 --> 17:09.120]  stuff like this when they want to pacify a population they do the opposite joe biggs you did that on
[17:09.120 --> 17:15.360]  three or four turds in iraq and afghanistan he knows that it's a basic military system this is
[17:15.360 --> 17:22.640]  military system to stir people up and start riots all over the country and play the public off
[17:22.640 --> 17:28.160]  against the police and the military to start a civil war and to make the poster boy for the civil
[17:28.160 --> 17:34.880]  war stupid ghetto rats with their pants hanging down around their ankles to then sell that image
[17:34.880 --> 17:41.200]  of the police and military crushing them to bring in permanent martial law and i've been telling you
[17:41.200 --> 17:45.760]  the number one way they'll bring in martial law is to get riots stirred up around the country by the
[17:45.760 --> 17:51.760]  illegals and blacks and poor whites and others i'ma skip the network break this is so important
[17:51.760 --> 17:58.560]  go to our reporters and then they'll stage terror attacks in the next phase claiming the tea party
[17:58.560 --> 18:03.360]  did it and go after their political enemies they're already censoring us on facebook and twitter
[18:03.360 --> 18:07.200]  they're already suspending our twitter accounts they're already not letting us put out a lot of
[18:07.200 --> 18:12.320]  tweets i couldn't tweet last night they're already stopping me sharing video links to
[18:12.320 --> 18:17.040]  joe bigs getting shot with rubber bullets and the police announced we're going to play this clip in a
[18:17.040 --> 18:30.080]  moment turn off your cameras two literally 15 news trucks we counted aljazeera washington post new
[18:30.080 --> 18:37.520]  york times us say today washington times info wars dot com i mean there are over 100 different
[18:37.520 --> 18:44.320]  press groups out there over 100 and more than 15 that were willing to be out there and our guys
[18:44.320 --> 18:48.880]  were up there about 100 and something yards away then they backed off to 500 yards i've talked to
[18:48.880 --> 18:54.480]  the reporters and they the the armored vehicles that we were told before al-qaeda i told you
[18:54.480 --> 19:04.240]  for the first amendment rolled out decepticons roll out attack the first amendment target freedom
[19:06.320 --> 19:14.320]  these are supposedly the good guys with flashbangs and rubber bullets and tear gas shot directly at
[19:14.320 --> 19:23.040]  news crews and then they chased them down with ar-15s ladies and gentlemen shooting people in the
[19:23.040 --> 19:29.680]  back i mean i'm not macho ladies and gentlemen but let me just tell you something i'm getting the
[19:29.680 --> 19:35.200]  point that i'm going to throw up and cooler heads have got to prevail we've got to keep our powder
[19:35.200 --> 19:40.800]  dry and not respond with these police who don't know they're the bait on the hook to start a civil
[19:40.800 --> 19:46.720]  war the cops on the ground being ordered by the feds to do this have no idea the us against them
[19:46.720 --> 19:53.520]  mentality this is a government with a seven percent approval rating they are they are more
[19:53.520 --> 19:58.480]  unpopular than kim jong-un in us polls they've actually done one with kim jong-un and he's
[19:58.480 --> 20:04.720]  more popular than this government now again i'm going to tell the military and police something
[20:05.360 --> 20:11.760]  when they're done waging their war against get it you know poor folks in the ghetto
[20:11.760 --> 20:16.160]  who will then take advantage of the burning and stuff to loot stuff that will then be projected
[20:16.160 --> 20:20.320]  onto the press and anyone that doesn't follow orders and then they're going to start censoring
[20:20.320 --> 20:31.760]  the internet even more talk about evil tear gassing rubber bulletin mainline news reporters

[35:40.720 --> 35:46.240]  biggs who knows about crowd control and talked about yesterday this is clearly to stir people up
[35:47.120 --> 35:51.440]  the justice department is there running things clearly wanting to stir things up like they got
[35:51.440 --> 35:56.560]  caught doing but trayvon martin uh so i want to get his breakdown on what happened last night

[36:00.160 --> 36:06.960]  to jacari jackson and others thank you for coming on joe biggs uh you were truly in wartime last
[36:06.960 --> 36:11.200]  night i saw you saying that in your report you've been in a lot of combat what was it like for you
[36:11.200 --> 36:17.280]  to see this in america joe biggs info wars dot com in ferguson missouri we're actually standing
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.160]  right here where the battle took place last night this is literally a war zone or was a war zone
[36:22.160 --> 36:26.880]  last night if you uh look around there's a little triangle area right in the middle of the road
[36:26.880 --> 36:32.080]  that's where we were standing when you could hear the turn off your cameras stop recording
[36:32.080 --> 36:37.840]  and then the vehicles approach us alex i'm telling you right now this clearly disappoints
[36:37.840 --> 36:43.360]  me to see this i mean i am nauseated at the scyoth that they used on us they are trying to
[36:43.360 --> 36:49.040]  to take something and racially divide everybody i mean it was ridiculous and then they were
[36:49.040 --> 36:53.280]  targeting journalists purposely trying to find them and arrest them and take their footage
[36:54.080 --> 36:58.320]  it was i just don't even know what to say i mean this place still smells like tear gas
[36:58.320 --> 37:04.000]  because they gas this place so bad the the cloud was for a mile back in either direction you went
[37:04.960 --> 37:10.560]  it was just mind-blowing explosions everywhere like what i was running around over here and
[37:10.560 --> 37:16.240]  when the the tear gas came at me we got lost i got separated from josh and jacari and it was just
[37:16.240 --> 37:23.440]  complete in total chaos just a battle and i started running in a direction and i made a mistake
[37:23.440 --> 37:28.080]  because i actually ran towards the riot police and as i started going across the park lot they
[37:28.080 --> 37:33.200]  shot me uh right in the side over here and if you want you can kind of see some of the bruise
[37:33.200 --> 37:41.920]  right now it's uh pretty tender and sore and i was watching the live feeds last night uh like it
[37:41.920 --> 37:49.200]  was a made for tv movie or something at home on info wars.com over ustream and other systems and
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.440]  i mean they would literally walk up to you guys from like a hundred yards away
[37:55.440 --> 37:58.800]  and say get out of here get out of here even though you were retreating and just wanted
[37:58.800 --> 38:05.680]  to shoot an american with these uh rubber bullet shotgun rounds you were just holding one of them
[38:05.680 --> 38:16.240]  up joe show the viewers that again i described the those are the the rounds that come out of this
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.480]  that's what that's what hit me we actually found this right over here in the area where i was shot
[38:20.480 --> 38:30.080]  these are these are very hard uh rounds i mean it was very painful i mean it took me to my knees
[38:30.080 --> 38:33.760]  and i hit the ground and a bunch of the locals from the uh the neighborhood ran over grabbed me
[38:33.760 --> 38:38.800]  and helped me up and said are you okay and as i was able to take in a breath i got shot with gas
[38:38.800 --> 38:44.880]  again and all i breathed in was just a full fresh hit of gas and i was just throwing up crawling
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.320]  and these guys are sitting there beating their shields yelling you know just they're just coming
[38:48.320 --> 38:52.400]  after us and you know when i looked around all i could see was smoker i mean i had no idea where
[38:52.400 --> 39:02.240]  i was it was nuts just to see america look like feluja iraq and the the people were fine people
[39:02.240 --> 39:07.760]  were protesting peacefully but what inside of this entire incident was they decided to bring
[39:07.760 --> 39:13.680]  in m reps snipers the snipers are on top of the vehicles calling out people in the crowd they were
[39:13.680 --> 39:19.920]  trying to antagonize the peaceful protesters they wanted someone to do something so they could
[39:20.640 --> 39:25.600]  you know eventually attack us there were cops on the side sitting there holding their batons
[39:25.600 --> 39:31.760]  twisting it back and forth with a smile on their face just sick chikara kept saying why are you
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.240]  smiling why are you smiling you know you need to be professional and this guy was just ready to hit
[39:36.240 --> 39:41.840]  someone i i just can't believe that i'm in america right here like this is something i expect
[39:41.840 --> 39:48.320]  in iraq afghanistan and some third world country but not in america this is just well for what i know
[39:48.320 --> 39:53.040]  from talking to a lot of marines and army people and others you don't ever want to act like that
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.120]  and turn the locals against you even if you're fighting an enemy that's amongst them that this
[39:57.120 --> 40:03.120]  would be the thing taylor made to turn a foreign population against you but this is our own people
[40:03.120 --> 40:08.640]  traitors really amongst us doing this and so i was hoping that the feds were ordering them to do
[40:08.640 --> 40:14.560]  this which we know they are but i didn't know that they were taunting again last night wanting
[40:14.560 --> 40:20.640]  somebody to throw a single bottle as did get thrown as a pretext to then set the precedent
[40:20.640 --> 40:26.640]  to attack reporters just like they set the precedent to put the entire city of boston
[40:26.640 --> 40:33.280]  under martial law just like they set the precedent in katrina to gun confiscate uh this is a plan
[40:33.280 --> 40:39.920]  they want war against the american people they see us as basically al-qaeda i walked up right to
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.160]  the line alex and i was just my feet are covered in blisters right now i mean my feet are like
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.400]  literally i can just peel off layers of skin and i got to a point where i couldn't even stand up
[40:48.400 --> 40:53.760]  anymore yesterday i stood or i sat down right in front of the uh m-wrap and right as i sat down it
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.160]  might have been a minute a bottle was right over my head and broke in front of me and i'm sitting
[40:58.160 --> 41:01.840]  there laying on the ground like oh my god these guys are about to shoot me because that dropped
[41:01.840 --> 41:06.160]  right in front of me and then actually you know uh a mall top cocktail got thrown over my right
[41:06.160 --> 41:10.080]  shoulder basically jacarys saw the person that did that it hit the top of the car wash over here
[41:10.080 --> 41:15.360]  if you want to look luckily i bet money that was a federal provocateur because they always do the
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.000]  mall offs and we're always catching them i mean what are the police things going to happen when
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.520]  they end up killing some more people and then folks don't pull out mall off cocktails and the real
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.160]  thing starts up well there's an article in rt they're saying that they are pulling the ferguson
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.480]  police department they are not going to be using them anymore they're going to bring in outside
[41:34.480 --> 41:38.880]  forces that was in an article today well i've already seen state police out there and they
[41:38.880 --> 41:45.280]  said they've been federalized two days ago i'm the people i saw last night did not look like
[41:45.280 --> 41:52.640]  regular cops i mean these guys were ex you know special forces things like that big jacked up guys
[41:52.640 --> 41:59.280]  you know they had the special forces type gear i mean and i just can't get the image out of my
[41:59.280 --> 42:04.560]  head alex if that guy just twisting that rod in his hand like he just wanted something to happen
[42:04.560 --> 42:09.280]  and that's where the bottle actually busted was right like maybe feet from him because people were
[42:09.280 --> 42:13.200]  tired of it people kept coming over and saying hey why are you doing that get that smile off your
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.760]  face you need to be professional i mean this is sick and well i mean also at a fundamental level
[42:17.760 --> 42:23.120]  it's it's the armored vehicles the body armor the tanks the aiming the lasers at men women and
[42:23.120 --> 42:30.640]  children uh the loaded guns it's so cowardly it'd be like watching an 800 pound gorilla beat up a
[42:30.640 --> 42:39.040]  one-year-old baby and then they're smiling about it it's just so dishonorable it's so cowardly i got
[42:39.040 --> 42:43.920]  chased over here and uh what happens you can see a neighborhood back here off into the back
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.880]  i got chased out of here and i had to start hopping fences i'm literally running through people's
[42:48.880 --> 42:53.440]  backyards there were two young teenagers who helped me out who are from the neighborhood and they said
[42:53.440 --> 42:57.760]  hey you need to get out of here they're looking for you guys so i started hopping fences and i'm
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.720]  running through and i'm right in line with the m wraps in the uh the militarized police force going
[43:02.720 --> 43:08.080]  down the road jacari was just in front of them and josh was off to the left and i'm running down
[43:08.080 --> 43:12.800]  through the woods the side trying to keep up with everything and the wind was down my way so i got
[43:12.800 --> 43:17.280]  all the gas i'm sitting there running through a cloud of smoke and all you can see is just red
[43:17.280 --> 43:22.640]  flashes and explosions and gunshots and it went i you know it sounded like a lot of them were some
[43:22.640 --> 43:27.920]  regular actual gunfire i mean it was it was very intense i mean i killed they killed another guy
[43:27.920 --> 43:33.040]  the other night probably uh like the other fellow the both of them all been shot in the back uh
[43:33.040 --> 43:39.680]  that's what real men do uh did you guys act like this even in iraq and afghanistan because when i know
[43:39.680 --> 43:43.680]  that i mean the military wanted to win those wars they didn't want to do stuff that would start a
[43:43.680 --> 43:48.880]  bigger one i mean i'll tell you right now i'd say 95 of the the people i ever came across in the
[43:48.880 --> 43:54.320]  military these are guys that were just there for beneficial reasons like they wanted to go to college
[43:54.320 --> 43:59.120]  they wanted to provide for their kids because they came from bad upbrings they didn't have anything
[43:59.120 --> 44:03.200]  and their only way to possibly have something in their life to look forward to was to join the
[44:03.200 --> 44:07.920]  military they had big hearts and these are people when we were over there in iraq and afghanistan
[44:07.920 --> 44:11.120]  they would sit there like me and this stuff's not right you know and if something was bad they're
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.480]  like i don't want to be part of this you know you might have one or two guys that just had that
[44:14.480 --> 44:19.520]  sadistic personality they just really wanted to go out and just start jumping people for no reason
[44:19.520 --> 44:25.040]  but these guys everybody they brought out here last night were a bunch of sadistic nutjobs it was
[44:25.040 --> 44:30.000]  crazy these guys were ready to attack that's what they came out for what we're going to do throw
[44:30.000 --> 44:36.480]  cardboard at them a set of keys well it's just like when i was i mean it's just like when the the
[44:36.480 --> 44:41.200]  dalis police chief says yep you're right you guys are supposed to be able to judge this you know
[44:41.200 --> 44:46.880]  ruling first amendment now that the official events are over for the anniversary of jfk
[44:47.920 --> 44:54.880]  you can go in and then we go in and they send out riot police from the county to physically attack
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.240]  even children and at the point they started attacking this little girl i said that's it guys
[45:00.240 --> 45:03.920]  we're going to go ahead and have to fight the cops then they gave them the order to back off
[45:03.920 --> 45:08.640]  so they just wanted to dominate us and then soon as i said all right man we can't let them
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.720]  they just attacked the seven-year-old girl let's i took my jacket up i said let's let's kick their
[45:12.720 --> 45:18.480]  ass i was gonna and then the pull and then they got a radio and all pulled out it's literal cowards
[45:19.280 --> 45:26.400]  little cowards i mean i've never seen anything this cowardly and pathetic this nation is pathetic
[45:26.400 --> 45:31.600]  and again i want to tell the cops you work for a criminal legitimate government okay and in a
[45:31.600 --> 45:35.680]  place like austin texas where they've had some questionable shootings they have a big community
[45:35.680 --> 45:40.320]  thing you know they try to investigate it they don't bring out armored vehicles and beat shields
[45:40.320 --> 45:46.960]  and put lasers on people or east austin would be burning and again i'm not even saying our police
[45:46.960 --> 45:52.240]  are perfect but compared to this i mean this is how you stir people up joe and you know that from
[45:52.240 --> 45:56.560]  iraq and afghanistan well that's what they're purposely trying to do like i said they were
[45:56.560 --> 46:00.160]  they were the ones that were inciting the violence they were the ones who wanted this to happen now
[46:00.160 --> 46:05.600]  look at the some of the chaos that happened this is a pretty thick sign after the round started
[46:05.600 --> 46:10.240]  flying and stuff last night it literally punctured holes stuff was hitting that canisters were shooting
[46:10.240 --> 46:15.120]  at it knocking that down across the road over here there's a you can see the fence they're trying to
[46:15.120 --> 46:20.160]  put back the family the riot police knocked it down trying to run after people they ran into
[46:20.160 --> 46:24.160]  that person's backyard and knocked the fence down and just a minute ago the family was out there
[46:24.160 --> 46:33.920]  trying to put the fence back on these were things that were getting thrown by them yesterday was
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.720]  a complete and total war zone and i just want people to know they've got to wake up because
[46:38.720 --> 46:42.960]  this is not just going to happen in ferguson this is going to start happening everywhere if we
[46:42.960 --> 46:47.840]  don't start doing something about it i mean the people out here were just screaming like why are
[46:47.840 --> 46:53.520]  we in a martial law state you know women were crying like you know why is this happening to us
[46:53.520 --> 46:57.360]  literally there was a group of ladies that were sitting down in the in the crowd
[46:57.360 --> 47:02.640]  crying and praying saying stop pointing guns at us stop pointing guns at our kids we just want to
[47:02.640 --> 47:09.520]  grow up safe well they built this giant police state up to fight al-qaeda and joe who was is made
[47:09.520 --> 47:19.840]  up of and who gave weapons to isis yes indeed our so-called government is evil and you cannot make
[47:19.840 --> 47:26.880]  excuses for any of this stuff what's going on and when you've got police multiple nights pointing
[47:26.880 --> 47:32.960]  guns at people trying to stir them up clearly it's going to start escalating and this is being
[47:32.960 --> 47:37.120]  run by the justice department i wish there was some way to de-escalate this but you know they've
[47:37.120 --> 47:43.600]  got the psychological profiles of all these state troopers and feds they brought in these are people
[47:43.600 --> 47:50.240]  that that enjoy attacking innocent folks and attacking you know mainline camera people i mean
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.120]  this is designed undoubtedly to cause an explosion well this was a war on race i mean they that's
[47:55.120 --> 47:58.960]  why they brought al-sharpton out here i spoke to some of the people in the crowd and i said hey
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.040]  did you have a chance to see him and they were like they use a little bit more colorful language
[48:03.040 --> 48:07.200]  but they said screw al-sharpton what has he done for us and i said well what do you think about uh
[48:07.200 --> 48:12.880]  lord and savior president obama they said screw that guy he hasn't done a thing for us he's like
[48:12.880 --> 48:17.440]  they've never made any change for us all they do is try to racially divide us we're sick of this we
[48:17.440 --> 48:21.840]  need real leadership that's right that's why they're run by the ford foundation to create racial
[48:21.840 --> 48:27.200]  division and all the hollywood movies do that and that's the open job of quentin tarantino and of
[48:27.200 --> 48:31.680]  course robert rodriguez who meet with the president and have been offered hundreds of millions of
[48:31.680 --> 48:37.200]  dollars of government funding to create all the racial division with movies like jango unchained
[48:37.200 --> 48:42.720]  and machete machete and all the rest of it this is the scyop and i know you've got those interviews
[48:42.720 --> 48:48.480]  gateway pundit wrote about that as well we need the video of that because just gateway pundit you
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.200]  know just has the use stream of it we need you to go out today and get hd interviews with those folks

[49:51.840 --> 49:57.600]  ago we assessed that many thousands of yuzidi men women and children obama looks like he has aids
[49:57.600 --> 50:04.800]  to take refuge on mounts literally in a desperate attempt to avoid slaughter we also knew that isle
[50:04.800 --> 50:09.360]  terrorists were killing and enslaving yuzidi civilians yeah and they're not christians so you
[50:09.360 --> 50:14.800]  gotta save them to the mountain murderer you should support a new order al qaeda faced a terrible
[50:14.800 --> 50:21.840]  choice starve on the mountain or be slaughtered on the ground that's when america came to help
[50:21.840 --> 50:29.040]  over the last week the u.s. military conducted humanitarian air drops every night delivering
[50:29.040 --> 50:36.000]  more than 114 000 meals and 35 000 gal again you bring al qaeda into murder everybody and then
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.280]  you save a small group and play the part of hero and bomb some some artillery to make it look like
[50:41.280 --> 50:45.920]  you're fighting al qaeda able to successfully strike isle targets around the mountain which
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.880]  improved condition now it's isa it's not isis or is the mountain safe that's all on purpose to confuse

[56:33.440 --> 56:37.760]  interviews with him but jacari this segment the next i got to get your take on being in that war
[56:37.760 --> 56:44.880]  zone i know you went up there uh you know totally non-biased uh and so did josh and everybody and
[56:44.880 --> 56:50.880]  boy uh i want your take on this because i gotta tell you i am i am just upset upset is not the
[56:50.880 --> 56:57.600]  word this is jacari jackson for info wars dot com reporting from pergus in missouri now i'll give you
[56:57.600 --> 57:02.160]  guys uh kind of the the long version of the story alex we started way down the street maybe we can
[57:02.160 --> 57:06.720]  get a shot this is where the quick trip is the initial protest from yesterday about four or five
[57:06.720 --> 57:11.280]  o'clock it started was down this street past uh i guess maybe you can see that public storage that
[57:11.280 --> 57:16.720]  orange building over there that's where we were initially congregated uh the protesters peacefully
[57:16.720 --> 57:21.280]  assembled and the officers they come out because the protesters were in the street
[57:21.280 --> 57:25.600]  i say protesters can you please get into the street and initially we were streaming live on
[57:25.600 --> 57:30.240]  you stream and i gave the cops credit because because i came out here initially in uh relatively
[57:30.240 --> 57:35.040]  small numbers i saw maybe about 10 or 12 guys initially but they do that again to act like
[57:35.040 --> 57:38.960]  they were reasonable yeah and that's the whole point because they come out here with the smaller
[57:38.960 --> 57:43.840]  force i said okay good maybe everybody's learning that this isn't world war three a few minutes later
[57:43.840 --> 57:48.880]  or maybe about uh an hour or so later they come out with a big emrat truck so i say okay here we go
[57:48.880 --> 57:52.400]  protesters get out the street because they're blocking the street the protesters get on the
[57:52.400 --> 57:56.960]  sidewalk and then the cops come block the street all the way across in both directions down that
[57:56.960 --> 58:01.120]  street and down this street and what you see me holding in my hand i'll get to in just one second
[58:01.120 --> 58:06.480]  so again they were kettling you to block you off yes and then they start funneling us back here
[58:06.480 --> 58:10.640]  to the original location where joe biggs talks about the truck point right in front of the quick
[58:10.640 --> 58:14.800]  trip where they have barricades on both sides i guess uh they're concerned about somebody attacking
[58:14.800 --> 58:19.360]  them which is pretty uh ridiculous if somebody's going to come on with a full-on assault so basically
[58:19.360 --> 58:23.760]  they push us back here to this location where we are now people are uh having somewhat of a block
[58:23.760 --> 58:28.400]  party in the street a church pulls up is broadcasting preaching a message from the back of a truck
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.640]  handing out water you know and somehow uh the police are concerned about this so we're out here
[58:32.640 --> 58:36.640]  for a couple more hours hold on stay there well of course they got to attack you americans can't
[58:36.640 --> 58:41.600]  be allowed to hand out pamphlets sit in a free country thank you carl break the whole thing

[59:57.680 --> 01:00:12.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:23.040]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones there's a political
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:29.520]  cartoon up on info wars dot com on the right hand side down towards the bottom we put the political
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.960]  cartoons shows a man laying on the ground with his hands out towards a paramilitary police who
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:43.200]  fight the enemy the american people saying don't shoot and then the paramilitary occupier is turning
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.000]  back towards a news camera screaming to them don't shoot of course they need to turn around with a
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.160]  rubber bullet shoot the guy reporter in the face then it would be accurate this is joke level and
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.920]  it just shows the government that thinks it's god and they put people in there that think they're
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.360]  god and they've why not they've gotten trillions of dollars stolen the borders are wide open the
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.240]  government put us under un control and this is how it works jacari i'm gonna bring you back at the
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.440]  bottom of the hour but i want you guys to go out and get these interviews with folks that uh i was
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.560]  told we're telling you guys that you know they were they don't see a obama as their savior either
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:26.240]  in fact what joe big said he was told is the exact quote that's being quoted uh by um the
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.680]  gateway pundit but i want to document that protesters last shot of obama and sharp and
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.880]  that's important to bring conservatives and liberals together against you know all this
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.200]  garbage and don't want to make it a political you know like the pro obama forces are pro
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:47.360]  demonstrators and then the the pro police people or republicans that's how they want to divide this
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.320]  i believe they're clearly trying to escalate this chicari give me your take on what you
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.240]  think's happening here and just overall what you thought of the night then we'll come back to you
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.880]  in 30 minutes after james o' keith joins us and you can tell the whole story and give us a turn
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.720]  well you know it's a very uh it was a horrible situation just to put it in one word if i could
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.720]  use one word it was a horrible situation because that's joe big's pointed out one guy throws a bottle
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.360]  that doesn't really even get close to the police and they say you are no longer peaceably assembled
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.840]  now you have to clear the area even though uh maybe you saw one of our earlier reports they
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.880]  had at least 70 guys heavy armor swat guys with the riot shields and all of that if they would
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.480]  have sent those guys out if they would have made it a priority to get that one guy that could have
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.960]  caught them and then a second guy comes and he throws a molotov cocktail that hits the uh the
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.120]  car wash over here and if they wanted to they could have made it a priority to go get that one
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.600]  guy but they didn't want to do that they wanted to say because two guys initially started this thing
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.800]  it started the conflict uh everybody now has to go home and then the semantics and the games that
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.120]  they play telling you that you have to go home we've documented that in multiple videos starting
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:57.360]  the first night we got here and they're saying there is no curfew they started saying that about
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.280]  four or five p.m or actually i guess it's six p.m why don't you just start saying you're illegal
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.960]  aliens and then they would cook you dinner and maybe change any babies diapers right but let me
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.760]  show you this alex this is what makes me so angry this is what was used against us you can see
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.920]  that uh triple chase this is uh the smoke grenade and maybe we can get a look at this it says smoke
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.720]  by trained and authorized personnel only so if you're trained and authorized to use this against
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.120]  unarmed american citizens that is perfectly fine and i'll be the first one to tell you there were
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.520]  some guys out here throwing uh throwing bottles and stuff at the police but for the three people
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.840]  i saw throwing uh molotov cocktails at the police i personally had three uh smoke canisters fired at
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:43.200]  me and rapid fire right down this street so i saw three molotovs and i had them shoot three of these
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.640]  at me at very well let's be clear they were targeting press that has a right to be there
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:54.720]  oh yeah and i mean look i bet money that the guys throwing the mall offs work for them
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.400]  and the cops may not even know that they i mean i'm telling you false flag
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.480]  if i had to i think we're trying to kick some stuff up i can't go as far as say they work for
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.600]  any particular person but i think they definitely wanted wanted a conflict and so the police they
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.240]  gassed the whole area they're telling people to return to their homes i met a sweet old lady out
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.160]  here actually gave me directions because i had to get off this main road where our vehicle was
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.000]  well i don't want to interrupt you we're going to give you the floor at the bottom of the hour

[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:24.160]  mind
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:38.400]  well james o' keith is with us till the bottom of the hour project veritas
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.520]  dot com i don't really need to introduce him to most the audience he's been arrested they've
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:51.280]  tried to indict him for being a member of the press he helped bring down akron and so much
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.720]  more by going in and saying you wanted to run underage prostitutes through their operation
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.840]  he is the true example of real journalism and that's why the authoritarian left
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.200]  he's always trying to have him put in prison and i wanted to get him on about a story that
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.280]  broke over the weekend and was on drugs for like three days a stunt that was genius to show how
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.120]  wide open the border is we've sent reporters down to go back and forth across the river
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:28.320]  but dressed up like a soma bin lad in the whole jihadi outfit just to show how ridiculous it is
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.280]  and and that's how you capture the public's attention so i wanted to play a clip of that
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:39.120]  as well after we talked some with him today but james o' keith obama just came out five
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.640]  minutes ago we have the clip coming up after you leave us and said oh i'm for the first amendment
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:49.280]  you know it's just we shouldn't be attacking the press in fergusson and and then the governor
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:53.280]  came out and said he's going to get the bottom of it i don't support the looters i don't know the
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:59.280]  truth about who shot this 18 year old man uh you know on purpose or whether it was an accident or
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.880]  was a scuffle michael brown but i have reporters there that were shot with rubber bullets flashbangs
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.560]  sound cannons alga zeroes hundreds of yards away they say turn your cameras off on loudspeakers
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:16.160]  and then start firing at my reporters and others arresting washington post reporters and people
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:22.640]  in a mcdonald's down the road as they're there ordering coffee i mean this is not a free country
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.920]  as somebody who's been targeted you know you came to the aid i came to the aid of um
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.880]  people like denisha susan when he got indicted on trumped up made up garbage about gibbons
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.880]  you know a few thousand dollars to a friend of his was running for the senate but we came to his aid
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:46.000]  if if bush would have had michael more arrested i would have come to his aid even though i don't
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.760]  like michael more is the press going to stick together on this i mean i don't even know your
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:57.680]  take on this yet so i'm going out on a limb here but regardless this is different issues the michael
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.400]  brown shooting and the way the police are acting and the fact that they're following federal orders
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.040]  to aim lasers at my reporters and others that are you know hundreds of yards away and uh i mean this
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:16.400]  is getting really bizarre james o' keith this could be the crisis just like with trevon martin
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.520]  we know the justice department there got caught stirring stuff up with secret agents that came
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:27.600]  out mainstream news this thing stinks to high heaven uh what's your take on it well i mean i saw
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:34.800]  that the two journalists were arrested and there's there's outrage on twitter about it um i myself
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:40.320]  have been arrested i was falsely accused they call it they're calling a false arrest and i i think
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:46.160]  it's outrageous what they're doing to um uh the guys to have an impostor the washington post um
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:51.680]  ryan riley and i have butted heads he's a civil rights reporter he's a post photo id laws and and
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:57.040]  he's they celebrated it when i got arrested and and really it comes down to labels and who's a
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.200]  journalist who's not a journalist that would when i wear a hidden camera and work for youtube
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.880]  you know i'm not a journalist therefore i'm not afforded the rights that that they are but
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.040]  yeah i saw that uh ryan paul just has a new piece out on time magazine just just minutes ago where
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:17.280]  he talks about the the militarization of police forces i mean i think i've been on your show
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:23.040]  before i've said that you know no matter as long as you're gathering information in my book you're
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.600]  considered a journalist and you should have all the rights of and a privilege is afforded a journalist
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.240]  but um it's it's really scary to see what's happening out there and and now there's even reports
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.080]  that you know they're looking out for people who are tweeting uh citizens who are tweeting they're
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.600]  going to come after them so um but i i think that you know i we've been on the front lines and and
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.480]  certainly i have been attacked and they've celebrated our arrest it's good to know now that
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.840]  people are looking out for these journalists getting arrested because it's an important thing
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:56.480]  well exactly and i've noticed you've defended the press whether it be left or right and again
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:04.480]  we see the left calling for free speech to be shut down uh whenever the uh irs goes after uh
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.840]  free speech organizations and and and non-profit press groups msnbc goes on and says yes shut
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.200]  down the tea party of course we're auditing you you're a terrorist organization but then rachel
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.720]  manow freaks out when the huffington post people get arrested hey how about we freak out all the
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:25.840]  time here yeah i think that's exactly right you know there needs to be outraged no matter who
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.880]  the person getting arrested is just because the washington bolster porter you know i saw this
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:37.200]  you know 10 000 retweets society becomes more outraged when it's a member of the establishment
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:43.840]  media class but if it's a blogger or an independent person the right needs to defend the left just as
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.480]  much as the you know left should defend the right rachel manow has spent so much so many hours attacking
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:54.640]  me you know and james is discredited he was arrested james was arrested well is that now
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.880]  the the thing that makes you discredited josh fox was arrested he's an academy award winner
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.320]  ryan ryan mr king was arrested 150 something times and it's a puts a false arrest the whole
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:10.880]  point of it it's a false arrest the police uh assaulted ryan riley yesterday they assaulted him
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.400]  they threw his head into they threw me against the car in new orleans they destroyed my evidence
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:22.320]  and and and we need to stop this left right thing when it comes to this when it comes to this
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:28.560]  particular issue of police brutality and civil rights what's happening with the police because
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:36.560]  you've been arrested and thrown in jail and harassed so many times how do cops and again most cops
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.840]  aren't like this but but but more and more cities have special units that will just march up an assault
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.800]  and beat up and falsely charge even mainline media now who's been defending bloggers and folks being
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:56.800]  attacked i mean what's wrong with them well i i i agree with uh ryan pols calm that he just wrote
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.360]  you know he said that um most police officer uh most police officers are good cops and good people
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:06.720]  and it's a difficult job in circumstances so i'm not necessarily faulting the police and my own
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:13.200]  my interaction is actually with the federal federal agents uh in new orleans and and people
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:19.520]  who are former police officers who became fbi agents but um i think that it's it's it's a top
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.120]  down problem you know the people just like this situation on the border this past this past uh
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.520]  week we went down there and we the federal agents were nowhere to be found they're kind of just doing
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:33.840]  their jobs but it's the people on top it's the people in washington that are given the orders to
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:43.520]  them not to do their jobs or to do a different job but um it's it's there's a again increasing uh
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.600]  effort to make journalism illegal in this country to make gathering information when you're out in
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.000]  the field i'm not talking about people who sit in cubicles in new york city people who are out there
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.880]  in the field gathering information there is an effort to try to either uh destroy their character
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:07.040]  or put them in jail and now and just now we're starting to see it on the left we're starting
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.840]  to see people at mainstream media outlets face the same type of issues that you've faced and i
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:17.760]  faced and citizen journalists have faced that's right and it's it's scary to see it intensifying
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:23.360]  and now they have internet kill switches going in obama's making announcements comment during my phone
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.320]  all the time even when it's off it turns on with obama messages my dad my mom everybody i know is
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:33.200]  getting them the whole office phones ringing and i get you know these weird democrat messages
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.560]  uh now they pass the bill in california to make kill switches by law being all the phones so police
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:45.280]  can turn them off during situations like this uh the genie cannot be put back in the bottle
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.800]  let me expand on this with you and then talk about your border investigation
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:17:00.320]  and what do you make uh of attempts uh by the irs to to shut down free speech and now the irs
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:06.160]  isn't getting in any trouble james that's what concerns me is that they've gotten away with
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.800]  all this and that what's bad is about to get a lot worse yeah there was someone someone comment
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.200]  and by the way what's happening with with washington post and that haven't imposed like it's it's
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:21.120]  deplorable and it's outrageous but it's it is interesting to note that you know when people
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:26.160]  when when catherine engelbrecht in texas gets audited by the irs and her company faces harassment
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:31.600]  from the justice department that is equally that is equally bad i mean we're talking about two both
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.080]  of these things are bad but nobody cares about the irate nobody cares about the irs harassing innocent
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:42.160]  people harassing you know auditing my andrew kwomo auditing me in new york state no one cares about
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.280]  that it's only about that you know there's one incident now in missouri but um i mean it's it's
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:53.200]  um i've i've said publicly that i'm going to do an investigation into the irs i'm going to go
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:59.440]  undercover uh i have to be careful because the irs is a federal agency and there are laws which the
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:04.240]  federal the federal government interprets broadly so if i'm like going undercover into a federal
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.200]  building i have to be careful but i'm going to investigate the irs probably in the fall or in
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:16.160]  the winter time and i'd love to get on on tape on undercover tape uh people like lois learner
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:21.840]  speaking candidly about her motives and about and about well you know where to go i mean you
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.560]  reported on it in dalis when people pointed out they were democrats they have democrat parties
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:32.240]  with stickers and they all get in big meeting halls and and basically chant and admit they're on the
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:38.480]  team to target conservatives i mean these they're like nazis or the soviets i mean they know they're
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:43.280]  bad well you got to go to the conferences you got to go to like where they have they went like in
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.800]  the irs to the congo line you know going to the summits the conferences the barbecues you got to
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:54.080]  go into their los vegas parties exactly and you got it and you got to get them speaking if we had
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.760]  videotape of lois learner saying exactly how she felt about the tea party everything would change
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:05.200]  they forget congress forget the hearings we'd bypass that and go right to the out it would
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:11.440]  outrage everyone and i think that like the osama bin laden thing you know the whole notion of of
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.200]  terrorists crossing into the united states that's not a divisive issue immigration is a divisive
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.360]  issue people i don't i like immigrants i don't like immigrants that's racist you're not racist
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:26.400]  but the moment you switch to something you know like targeting people and getting it on tape
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.320]  i think that's going to bring people together that's exactly what i want to get on tape well i
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:36.240]  mean you're not just a journalist james you've changed the world thank you and no thank you and
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.120]  then i'm just sick of all these lazy new york times and cnn people oh you read the new york
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:46.320]  times you're so smart when they just go around regurgitating pseudo-intellectual crap from the
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:52.160]  white house so you're not as good as the new york times you're a thousand times better and i mean
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:57.600]  it thank you we are the new press and we wear our bias to promote freedom and tell the truth openly

[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:11.200]  group have been part of and it's a how to go out and be a true grassroots muckraking journalist you
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.840]  and matt drudge and others are heralding the return and in full wars as well and my reporters and
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:23.600]  many others of journalism the mainstream has become a vacuum because they don't operate like journalists
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.360]  they're repeaters when they do journalistic activities they get rubber bulleted and arrested
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.200]  in closing in the five minutes we've got left you know matt drudge last year uh tweeted that
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:41.600]  senator feinstein was a fascist and and she is a fascist saying that the new york times could
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.800]  have journalistic protections but you and i couldn't uh that it has to be a mainline media group
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.280]  and that congress has to say who has the first amendment well that's like the state saying
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.960]  they can say what churches can exist uh we've all got to come together as the press and as the people
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.800]  and decry what's happened or we're going to lose it all uh the system is threatened by this and the
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:08.000]  cops yeah i mean if there's no first amendment they're gonna lose their second amendment and so
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.640]  we're all in this together uh your take on what we face as a society and where you see us as a
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:21.040]  culture i think uh it requires ordinary citizens stepping outside their comfort zone you made a
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.480]  comment in the last uh segment you said um if they're sitting in their cubicles in new york or
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:31.280]  they're sitting in new york city in washington the some people got to get out into the field they
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:37.840]  got to take their cameras outside the newsroom and and go out into the the crowd and i don't care
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.640]  whether you're on the left or the right the fact that they're you're in missouri or you're in texas
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.080]  you're on the board well i think it will criticize me what are you doing down there james aren't you
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.440]  making a mockery of this whole border debate by dressing up like osama and i said actually cnn
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:57.600]  showed images of the of the lack of a fence and they were only showing those images because of what
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.680]  that we did at project veritas we forced the mainstream media to cover issues they don't
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:07.120]  i mean they always complain when we're successful and change the world bring in down akron exposing
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:14.160]  the irs you've done that and dozens of other world shaking stories so they say you don't have an
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:18.800]  effect and you're pathetic and you're discredited because you got arrested i mean it's ridiculous
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:24.000]  they say drudge doesn't have any power and i don't have any power it's pure bull they're losing the
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.760]  power because they're frauds i'm sorry go ahead they need to leave their their air conditioned
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:36.320]  offices and go out into the country and take a camera like i have a way to change here's how
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.720]  we change the world all the people that consider themselves journalists let's say there's 10 or
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:48.560]  20 000 of them just take a camera leave your office go to a local air government office and start
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.440]  asking difficult questions if all the journalists just took a camera and started asking questions
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.560]  we live in the world would be a better place but they're not going to do that they're going to
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:03.120]  sit on twitter all day and and that's my my my my my urge i urge journalists to do this type of thing
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.520]  and as far as feinstein is concerned and all those people yes it's very scary stuff but they
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.680]  can't stop all of us so we got to stick together and step outside our comfort zones and go out in
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.960]  the field that's my solution well you're absolutely right and mainstream media's ratings continue to
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:22.000]  plunge while our ratings go up and up and up i call them the dinosaur media i call us the real
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.760]  media i mean what's the best name for establishment media uh in your view and then what's the best
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:32.720]  name for us i would call them political marketing officials i would not call them journalists
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.920]  because they're they're they're advertisers for the political marketing industry that's like
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:44.320]  political.com is a sort of ruling class uh marketing uh machine that that they basically
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.400]  political.com serves the political class in washington and then the political class in
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.680]  washington serves political.com what we should call ourselves is is journalists i'm even
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.480]  thinking about it abandoning the citizen portion of that just journalists because that's the role
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.200]  of a journalist is to speak truth to power and um i think that's what we should we should refer
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.680]  but these labels these these these notions that well he's a journalist therefore it's wrong for
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.320]  that he got arrested but oh keith and alex jones well they're not journalists so i hope they
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:20.160]  rot in prison and these labels are just ridiculous the fact is we're exposing the truth we're speaking
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.360]  truth to power and you're going out into the field to gather information absolutely and and
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.360]  everybody needs to get out and do their own youtube's their own news and then there's no way
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:35.600]  they can ever censor all of it the real revolution is the info war right now james o keith from all

[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.800]  job there aren't state run we're going to talk for the rest of the hour but jacari jackson
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:02.400]  and josh owens and joe biggs who are there in fergusson we do have the clip of obama's response
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.080]  coming up that actually sounds very reasonable and fair what he said but again it's all a
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:14.960]  disingenuous psiop why i predicted he would do just this last hour before he spoke i said that
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:22.240]  obama would come out and do exactly what he has now done well you know this is a local issue so
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:27.440]  we weren't really in control of it and we need to investigate and the police need to be transparent
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:33.120]  about what happened to michael brown who was shot last weekend and we also need people not to use
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:39.200]  this as cover for looting or vandalism and you know for attacking police officers there's never a
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:47.600]  good time to do that and then he goes on to say but we also need to not have the police attacking
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:55.440]  peaceful protesters and the press is doing their job but meanwhile the surrogates are out there all
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:00.240]  running the psiop well he's calling for calm on trevon martin the justice department's in there
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.960]  actually organizing the demonstrations trying to get riots going because if he can get a bunch
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:10.320]  of black people rioting around the country that'll get folks off the subject of fast and furious and
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.920]  open borders and the rest of it we're gonna get our guests in a minute but it's not good luck they say
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:22.320]  that i'm not superstitious but i am just to be safe people i'm not superstitious but i am knock
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:27.920]  on wood i think being superstitious means you don't take everything for granted you're not arrogant
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.400]  i found some of the smartest people i know are superstitious they say you don't toast with
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:41.040]  water so i'm going to put in a supermail vitality for my lunchtime dose
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:48.720]  into this filtered water and then i'm going to put a squirt of survival shield x2
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:58.240]  in there and stir it up and then my new super product of the secret product that's going to be
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:07.600]  coming out in a few months to put a squirt of that in there and this is my little uh cocktail even
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:14.000]  though there's zero alcohol in it that i'm going to have from all natural gifts that god gave us
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.160]  absolutely delicious i'm going to be enjoying the rest of that while we talk to our reporters
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:30.000]  again i toast jacari jackson joe biggs josh owens kit daniels adan salazar kurt nemo
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:38.800]  leon macadoo marcos morales rob dude darin mcbreen john bound the entire crew in here just
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:42.240]  everybody i need to go through the whole list but the pressure the folks that were out there in
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.760]  the field last night and the and and my reporters that were writing about it at one a.m hit daniels
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.920]  and others did a great job covering what happened so far we'll have more coverage
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.760]  sit on on the nightly news and throughout the evening with our reporters who have chosen to
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:01.600]  stay in ferguson for the foreseeable future while this unfolds i know jacari and others
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.520]  have got to come back and take care of their dogs and stuff but we'd have another team go up to
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:13.760]  ferguson if this continues i'm going to go up to ferguson probably next monday uh it's just a
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.760]  hop skip and a jump up there's we're gonna do that now i've done an hour and 37 minutes of
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.560]  broadcasting today i've not plugged anything it's very expensive to send reporters all over the
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:28.640]  country all over the world it's very expensive to run this operation so we don't get rockefeller funding
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:36.080]  or uh banker bailout money stimulus money or taxpayer money like mpr and msnbc we are funded
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:42.560]  by selling high quality water filtration at the lowest price free market high quality groundbreaking
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:49.600]  supplements at the lowest price in foreshelife.com mole on lobby designer belt buckles and george
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:38:02.320]  washington belt buckles now uh continuing here folks it is absolutely essential that you support
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:08.080]  us and you've been doing that but if people did a lot more with your free will you're buying war
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:14.800]  bonds or basically working in a factory uh building bombs so that our pilots can go out and take on
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:19.760]  the enemy i mean that's the equivalent of what you're doing when you buy the high quality coffee
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:26.880]  or get the high quality 1776 uh products at maiden1776.com when you buy a ball cap when you
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.760]  buy a moan lobby t-shirt when you buy a book when you buy a film when you buy the magazines in bulk
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:40.080]  at cost you're helping get the word out it's all about fighting the tyranny and the money goes
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.880]  right back into this operation right back into funding our operation and expanding what we're
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:56.320]  doing infowarslife.com prisonplanet.tv infowars.com prisonplanet.com and even if you can't buy the
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.440]  fine products we've got that i'm extremely proud of you can tell friends and family about the
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.960]  broadcast you can spread the word about the show and people will come here and get a perspective
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:12.000]  they're not getting anywhere else that has shown itself to be the zeitgeist on the pulse of what's
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.560]  happening and i'm not like a lot of other talk show hosts i want to just win this thing i don't
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.480]  want to live in a big mansion and have private jets not that that's bad if you make the money on
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:26.400]  your own that's great that's how the economy works my treasure the fortune i want is to defeat these
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:33.760]  tyrants i want to win the game it isn't a game at all it's life it's my soul my children's soul
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:39.440]  your soul your children's soul your future it's about being honorable in my time alive it's about
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:45.440]  being real it's about being a man it's about being fearless it's about being strong it's about
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.360]  conquering fear that's why you see me out at public events where i'm being death-threaded
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.680]  with no bodyguards and why i advertise that and it's not because i have a death wish it's because
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:40:00.320]  i have transcended the fear i have transcended the weakness i am ready you understand that
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:08.720]  and i don't look forward to anything happening but i am committed i will not be a coward i will die
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:18.720]  a man like my ancestors before me that's what matters it comes down to that poem child roll
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:25.920]  in the dark tower came and there they were all to see the last of me and dauntless i lifted the
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:33.440]  slug horn to my lips in blue child roll into the dark tower came you understand that 14 minute poem
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:39.440]  if it's read by book on audiotape you can find it on youtube you understand that poem you understand
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:45.920]  it all it's what it's all about and if you're a woman it's about being beautiful when you're young
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:51.120]  and being a great mother as you grow and then being someone who guides your family and is a rock
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:57.520]  through hard times to build the next generation and move forward as well that's what we'll give
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:04.400]  you fulfillment not trying to be a part when you're 60 years old like jones rivers you know it's
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:10.080]  like 80 something those are the most vapid empty unhappy people because they worship the flesh
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:19.200]  and the the low-level bestiality that this whole system creates and pushes
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:23.920]  us turning us into animals instead of reaching for our higher angels
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.560]  i'm gonna stop preaching the point is we bring on all these other hosts all these other people
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:36.640]  and i celebrate james o' keith even though project veritas has never promoted anything we've done
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:43.200]  i celebrate other talk show hosts that tell the truth and get the word out and our venues
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:51.440]  to enlighten others we got george norrie coming on last hour he's a big man nobody when he first
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:57.920]  heard of me on 13 years ago it's got to be that long ago now while time flies nobody
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:04.720]  has other talk show hosts on people like george norrie and myself no national host does that
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:09.680]  michael savage does it more and more you see it happening because people it isn't about the
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:13.920]  ego of the show it isn't about who's the biggest it's about having a future it's about taking care
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:19.360]  of your children and grandchildren it's about sharing info and trying to save the world the people in
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:28.960]  the world from the world and i mean it is it is a real pleasure and i relish shing jakari jackson
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:36.240]  and joe begs and josh owens do an incredible job out there in furgus in missouri and to see them get
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.400]  shot with rubber bullets and hit with tear gas and to have the courage to do what they did
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:46.720]  and to be honorable and have the moral authority through it it is so good to have kinsmanship
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:53.120]  with people like that that's what life's all about to be to have a feeling of satisfaction
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:43:02.400]  at their chivalry for all of our freedoms that's what builds the civilization i mean the footage
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:06.560]  we've got an hd that's coming in now from the guys it's like something out of a movie we're showing
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:13.600]  some of it now the war zone and how the police have been militarized and prepared for the public
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:25.120]  i guarantee you reading about western justice and stuff 150 years ago one sheriff in a place like
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:30.320]  dodge city or tombstone could have walked one texas ranger could have gone up to a crowd like that
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.120]  in almost every case talked them down and gotten it to stop by promising to get justice by bringing
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:41.200]  community leaders in to see the evidence by by firing a cop or arresting a cop that that that
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.520]  shot somebody innocent they would have had respect this whole thing would have been shut down right
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.640]  bam just like that instead you see the spectacles like this they could cause this country to burn
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:55.360]  and start a civil war that the globalists want that i've been warning you about let's go down to
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.400]  the sweltering heat 105 degrees in the middle of missouri with jacari jackson jacari tell the
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:07.440]  story now of what unfolded yesterday then we'll talk to our valiant cameraman josh owens jacari
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:12.240]  jackson reporting from ferguson missouri you know as you just mentioned alex uh it got pretty hot
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.120]  last night it's not just the heat from the summer here's the heat from the flash bang grenades
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.120]  that set this whole thing off maybe you can hear behind me all the people driving by
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.200]  they're honking they're showing their support for the community it's a large church group out here
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:29.360]  who out here trying to wake people up not just to uh to the police state but also trying to get
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:33.840]  them uh spiritually ready for the things to come but going through the story last night we got here
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:39.600]  probably about four or five p.m. and the protesters peacefully at that time were gathered uh right down
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.920]  the street from where we are and they were in the street and the police come up with small numbers
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:47.760]  they say hey can you guys get out of the street you're blocking the street so the protesters
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:51.760]  eventually get on the sidewalk that's when they pull up with the big m-rap trucks and then they're
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:57.920]  out there uh 70 plus guys heavy armor batons helmets guys on top of the m-raps with the snipers
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.240]  aimed at people they didn't just have them on the turns they were aiming them at people in the crowd
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.600]  i was standing close enough to them alex where i could hear what they're saying hey look at that
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.200]  guy in the orange shirt look at that guy in the red shirt and i look around and it's some guy who's
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:12.800]  you know has his hand behind his back stretching like this but i guess they think that he's
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:17.760]  reaching for a weapon and then the guy uh another guy had all the smoke agents all the uh the chemical
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:25.440]  agents a lot of a lot of support going on out here so uh eventually they they say you can protest in
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:28.800]  the daytime then they come out and they say you can't protest in the daytime even though it's six
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:33.120]  p.m the sun was clearly out so everybody's standing on the sidewalks you guys can't stand on the
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:38.000]  sidewalk i said well well sir this is a public sidewalk is what we're saying to these guys
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.400]  and they said you can't you can't stand here they eventually say sir back to you no they don't treat
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:46.480]  you with respect no they no they they don't do that so they start pushing myself they start pushing
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:51.040]  Joe Biggs we have to all move back because they're saying if you stay here you're going to get arrested
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:54.960]  so they shove it they're shoving us if you stay here you're going to get arrested so they're
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:59.200]  they're brutalizing us as they're telling us to get down the street so eventually get to the area
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:03.760]  where we are now we see all these protesters everybody's peaceful in the streets people
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:08.160]  were having a somewhat of a block party in the middle edge of car we're showing hd footage you
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:15.920]  guys have now had a chance to upload to us of them training their m4 m16s on peaceful people even
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:22.160]  daring the daylight i mean they this is show provocative oh yeah that's right and another thing
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.840]  alex uh when they were moving the big m wraps they kept saying nobody throwing anything we're
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:29.840]  like we're not throwing anything no my throwing anything with no nobody was throwing anything
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.240]  at that point the guy who threw the initial bottle was several hours later so we're out here because
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:38.240]  the police have the streets blocked off in both directions so a church group's out here there's
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:44.080]  at least three or four people out here 300 uh three or four hundred people out here at that time
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.920]  and so everybody's out here congregating and then eventually probably about two or three
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.400]  hours later once the sun went down you know somebody took it upon themselves to throw a bottle
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:58.160]  at the police and because one guy threw a bottle nobody can have a first amendment anymore even
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:02.960]  though they had 70 plus heavy armor guys who could have easily ran out here caught that one guy no
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:08.400]  nobody can be out here because we're no longer peaceably well that's like when one teenage kids
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.520]  running and is hiding in a boat they shut down half the city and go in people's houses grabbing
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:18.640]  blonde-haired women by the hair dragging them out naming guns at people like boston yeah just like
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:24.560]  it's all a power grab that's what this is all about oh it is a power grab because they're out here
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.120]  power tripping they're on the loudspeakers get back and then you hear the the soft voice woman
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.280]  she says please uh please turn off your cameras or she said please just turn off your cameras
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:36.720]  we all look at each other they say just turn off your cameras no we're not going to turn off our
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.000]  cameras because if you think about all the uh the hostility we got while our cameras are on how
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.640]  much more when the cameras are off well you're absolutely right jacari and it's so much more
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:53.360]  has happened i mean now we're getting the hd footage you guys shot in the dark last night
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:59.200]  you're in neighborhoods and they're chasing after people just like when rob do got arrested in
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:05.760]  pittsburgh for the g20 the the g20 was over and they went to the university to find kids out at
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:11.520]  night in the park eating dinner and we're assaulting women on bicycles right and then chasing people
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:17.360]  under the dorms attacking them like mad dogs that yeah that's what it was it was a mad dog
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:21.360]  mentality because some of these people well not so many of these people live in this neighborhood
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.920]  right behind me so they were shooting tear gas and rubber bullets at people standing in their own
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:31.120]  front yards and i was with uh you guys probably saw when they threw the uh the flashbang at alga
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.440]  zero i was standing right there when that happened because we all got separated myself from the rest
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.640]  of the uh info wars crew and i saw a bunch of camera people there's also a local mbc affiliate
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.080]  over there as well i said okay they're probably not going to attack us they see the lights they see
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.800]  the cameras no they said okay we see a good lit up target let's attack these guys they shot the guy
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.280]  from alga zero so we all take off running because they have the they keep shooting the smoke and i
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.600]  had to actually hop over somebody's fence when you got saw in the video they shot a three flashbangs
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.160]  that mean bang bang bang so i had to hop over somebody's fence we're running we had to run to
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.960]  somebody's heart very briefly to get to the other side and there's this uh this girl who had inhaled
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.680]  the smoke and we had to actually lay her down on the ground and the rest of us uh we're just trying
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:15.760]  to get positioned so they wouldn't come after us anymore but they went all the way down the street
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:20.240]  that maybe we can show them joss they started right here back where this uh this black car is and
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:26.240]  they just went all the way down the street just uh shooting smoke flashbangs going down the street
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:31.360]  is where we found the ordinance that joe bigs was showing you about the uh about the rubber bullets
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:36.480]  about the gas canisters all that stuff was going all the way down the street i mean like joe bigs
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:41.840]  said there was a huge plume of smoke going all the way down the street it no doubt went into this
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.080]  neighborhood behind us so innocent people who were just out sitting on their front porch had to breathe
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:51.360]  this as well well again jacari jackson reporting from furgus in missouri if you just joined us uh
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:55.200]  jacari you guys plan to be there tonight and throughout the next few nights and we'll get more
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.680]  reporters up there to relieve you so we need to start setting that up uh via the weekend then i guess
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.560]  if it's still going on i'll make plans to go up there on monday i've got child issues and things
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:09.120]  i gotta take care of this weekend but who knows i may have to go up there regardless because it
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.880]  looks like this is starting to escalate any word on what we know is coming up tonight well all i've
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:20.960]  heard is that i believe it was reported by uh rt that the local police are no longer going to police
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.560]  this area even though they didn't really seem like police to me they seem more like a invading
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.040]  military force so who's going to replace them if that is true i'm not sure if it's going to be
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:34.000]  national guard i'm not sure if it's going to be some private outfit i don't know uh so we have to
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.280]  wait and see at this point but we have seen uh local police uh straight state troopers and so forth
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:43.120]  driving up and down here they're not blocking anything off at this point they usually start the
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:47.360]  blockage probably about three or four o'clock so we'll probably find out around that time
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:52.720]  who's actually going to be out here uh quote policing the lights out america lights out at

[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:13.360]  any people had firearms and now you've witnessed this here it's just incredible they try to say
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.400]  everybody at Bundy was racist whites now they're saying it's racist blacks no they're just humans
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.480]  that don't want to be hunted and killed and I don't want to make the police the enemy either
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:29.280]  but they're being given orders and doctrines that are authoritarian and will cause civil war
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.560]  Josh Owens info wars.com cameraman give us your take on what you've witnessed in Ferguson Missouri
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.280]  Josh Owens reporting from Ferguson Missouri yeah I would like to give my
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:43.120]  my account of what happened because it's a little bit different than theirs
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:48.240]  it all started right back here where we were all together they start coming in they start
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:55.920]  throwing flashbangs throwing tear gas big runs over here get shot jacar runs to the other side
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:59.840]  of the street and I run straight down this street right here that you can see behind me
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:07.600]  as soon as I start running they start shooting tear gas all around my feet and I'm not the
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:13.200]  healthiest guy in the world so I'm breathing heavily and I literally cannot catch my breath
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:17.120]  and I start vomiting immediately I know it's disgusting but this is just what happened
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:23.760]  start vomiting immediately and I go blind I can't see anything I run into a car over here
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:29.120]  as they're continuing to throw explosions all around me I run into a car and someone was nice
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:33.120]  enough to give me some water I throw it in my eyes we all keep running down there while I'm
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:40.320]  still trying to film them pushing forward throwing flashbangs throwing tear gas as soon as I get down
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:49.120]  here probably uh I don't know one fourth of a mile they start flooring the m reps they start
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:55.840]  running towards us they start arresting people so I start running down this road and I run into a
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:01.760]  neighborhood they chase me into a neighborhood and inside the neighborhood over the houses
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:05.600]  they're throwing tear gas into the streets of the neighborhood because a lot of people were
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.080]  running by the way those are very flammable you're not supposed to do that that's a big news issue
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:15.920]  that's what probably burned down Waco uh wow you're saying they were shooting those overhouses
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:20.240]  they were shooting them overhouses into the neighborhood so I'm running through the neighborhood
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:28.880]  still vomiting completely blind I cannot see anything and uh luckily enough I found someone
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:34.320]  in a car I actually ran into the car and it was a vice reporter she let me into the car hold on I

[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:29.040]  we're back josh owens info wars.com reporter and cameraman he was at bundy ranch you name it
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:36.080]  what an exciting and dangerous job it is now i've been through a lot of this stuff myself but
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.600]  it's time for me to start going on on some more of these as well just so i'm even
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:43.440]  can't let all the young bucks have all the fun so you're you're running through neighborhoods
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:47.920]  now i saw some of that hd footage you sent us so i guess even though you were vomiting and stuff
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.640]  i'm guessing it's you because i mean it came in from your box of the hd footage it looks eerie like
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:01:00.560]  out of a movie men in black uniforms marching smoke trees lining little neighborhood so you're there
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:06.960]  you run into this vice car vice magazine vice hbo you get in a car with a reporter now watch
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:13.520]  you got a girlfriend josh tell us what else happened next so i jump in the car i'm still
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:17.040]  i'm opening the door to continue throwing up because i don't want to throw up in this nice
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:22.640]  woman's car i can't see anything and we try and pull out of the neighborhood because i think we're
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:27.040]  in a car now they're going to let us out we try to pull out of the neighborhood they start shooting
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:32.320]  flashbangs at the car as we're trying to pull out so we floor it through the neighborhood there's no
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:37.680]  other way out of the neighborhood except these two two exits both blocked off and any cars that come
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.320]  by the exits they're shooting flashbangs at the car they're a resting reporter so if i walked out
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:48.560]  they would have arrested me so we sit there for about 30 minutes i still cannot see anything
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:54.480]  and finally we see them pull out to this other exit over here and we floor it out of there
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:59.920]  and go down this street and i meet up with the guys down there and like you said i was at bundy ranch
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:10.400]  um we uh were detained in san antonio for trying to uh catch bo burgle coming in uh the nsa facility
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:16.560]  they tried to threaten us and take our footage this is the most surreal experience of my life
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:25.520]  to this day what's your gut tell you is coming tonight my gut says that tonight it's going to
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:30.800]  be worse i don't know if that's true but my gut is saying that tonight uh people are are pissed off
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.240]  about what happened last night they kept being pushed and pushed and pushed and then they were
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:38.960]  attacked um i think a lot of reporters are scared now because they don't feel like they have carte
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:42.240]  blanche to stand on the side of the street and report which a lot of them were standing there
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.960]  because they thought they were going to be left alone so i think tonight uh it's going to get worse
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:55.200]  well it's all about power and control but the government is now illegitimate at so many levels
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:59.440]  and i don't want the breakdown of legitimacy i wish the government would pull up but
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.600]  people are sick of the lies are sick of the fraud and more force is not the answer i wish this could
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:11.040]  be de uh de-escalated and you guys have already gotten incredible footage i want you guys to stay
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:17.600]  off to the side tonight and in back of them other reporters because i mean you've already been up front
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:21.840]  i don't want you i want you guys to really try to stay safe up there well obviously
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:27.840]  bail you out like i did rob do have you get arrested we'll sue them and we'll win like we
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:32.080]  won that settlement that we're not allowed to talk about but we don't want to win settlements
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.920]  you know we have to sue because we have to show we're in the right but quite frankly i don't want
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:44.480]  to mess with it uh but if they arrest any of you guys or keep attacking him we probably could win a
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:49.200]  lawsuit right now with bigs getting shot if we can prove they targeted him on purpose i was watching
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.000]  jakari's videos he's like hey stop it you know he said they were shooting at him because they knew
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.600]  he was a reporter i mean is that what you witnessed yeah yeah and i honestly i think the reason they
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.840]  were trapping people into this neighborhood is because i think they saw reporters go in the
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:07.120]  neighborhood and i don't think they wanted people to leave with the footage that they well i mean
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:11.280]  obviously they're on tape saying please turn your cameras off and grabbing al jazeera's cameras
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:17.040]  and shooting rubber bullets at them i mean that think about that exactly i mean they are trying
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:22.000]  to cattle everybody so i mean they're so dumb they don't know al jazeera was transmitting that
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.680]  footage out i mean don't they understand i mean it's just ridiculous well like you said earlier
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:31.920]  if there was an old you know if this was the old west and there was an old west west sheriff out here
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.000]  that came out and talked to people face to face like they were humans then you know what a lot of
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.880]  these people they don't come out here uh wanting to incite violence at least the last couple of
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:47.600]  nights that we've been here they come out here peaceably and then these um these police come up
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:52.480]  in tanks pointing guns at people if you see in that b-roll that i said they were pointing a gun at
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:58.560]  me oh i saw that the guys on the top of the armored vehicle aiming it right at your camera i mean what

[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:23.200]  here second most syndicated radio host behind rush limbaugh in the country post the 600 am and fm
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:30.000]  stations xm and he's even syndicated in places like canada and europe coast to coast am dot com
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:37.840]  beyond belief dot com is his popular television show uh as well and he i mean i asked him to come
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:41.760]  on a few weeks ago and he said yeah i want to come on talk about the the initiative he's promoting
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:47.520]  there's only a few billion dollars we've talked about this as well to harden the electrical grid
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:53.680]  so that an artificial or man-made emp solar flares or man-made emp will not knock us back to the
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:58.080]  stone age and make all the nuclear reactors meltdown when they don't get power diesel fuel
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:04.720]  so we're going to talk about that protecting the grid uh that is uh one of the big issues
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:10.560]  that george norrie has been covering and he's going to be talking more about that uh as well
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:16.240]  on his show but first off obviously george uh you're from michigan and of course from the
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:21.600]  navy for a while before that but your big start uh was in tv won a bunch of uh you know television
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:27.360]  awards uh what emmy's for that but then you went into radio i guess that's how you got your uh
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:32.960]  you know coast to coast gig uh 13 years ago or whatever it was there being on the air out of
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:38.800]  st louis you were known as the night hawk i guess with the number one rated show there and so you
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:43.920]  know this area you know what's happening so i'm going to have to pick your brain first on this
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:49.440]  and some of the other issues before we get into the big enchilada with you but uh george norrie of
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:55.200]  coast to coast am dot com uh thank you so much for coming on with us today alex my friend good
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:01.680]  to be with you and i am going to be in that area next week i'm going back to st louis for three weeks
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:10.000]  and i'm very familiar with the ferguson area um it is a coin neighborhood that right now is
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:17.920]  absolutely out of control um with a police department that just doesn't understand how to
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:24.400]  handle this kind of situation and that's why it's getting blown out of proportion they can't
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:30.720]  handle the media they can't handle the people and they really just don't know what they're doing
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:37.840]  we don't know what exactly happened between that police officer and the poor young man michael
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:44.240]  brown in that shooting episode but the entire episode has now been blown out of proportion
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:52.080]  in two ways number one there are a group of thugs who want to profit off anything that happens
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:58.960]  i mean so when you go to protest a truly sad story of a young man being shocked to death
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:06.000]  by police you don't go from break stores and loot and steal and hit you stores with a number of
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.720]  cars showing up in a coordinated effort so that's problem number one problem number two
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:19.840]  the police out there and they don't have this kind of crowd control experience are absolutely
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:28.320]  uptight and consequently they are showing it in front of cameras with media with the people
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:35.200]  and they need some help i mean we need to get some serious either national guards in there to
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:41.600]  calm things down and to get this thing resolved i was in detroit during the early riots in the
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:49.680]  60s and i saw that thing fester out of control and this is a little ferguson and i don't want to
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:58.800]  see the same thing happen not now not in 2014 this is not 1960 again and it's it's got to come down
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:05.600]  i'll be that as it may we also should be talking about the overly aggressive police forces in this
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:10.640]  country uh because they've got to slow down and again we don't know what happened here
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:16.880]  with you know the officer apparently has some bruises something happened there was an altercation
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:26.160]  cnn had a witness a young african-american woman who saw a fight a wrestling with michael brown
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:32.080]  outside the police cruiser with a cop inside we don't know what happened uh and unfortunately
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:37.520]  ferguson doesn't have video cams on their cars so we definitely can't see what happened
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:46.800]  that's the best we know in fact i may come up there next week um i know you do your
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:52.240]  show part of the time in la part of the time uh literally from a cave complex uh there
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:57.520]  in st louis and i've never seen that complex so maybe we can hook up for dinner or something
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:03.760]  when i'm up there i know i'm gonna come on the tv show and see you in denver uh in a few months
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:08.240]  so that's finally gonna happen look forward to doing that with you george but you are the expert
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:12.800]  on st louis obviously living there for so long and still living there having your main house
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:17.600]  there so i'm glad we've got you there on the ground maybe you'll even go out there uh yourself
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:23.680]  and do some reporting like you used to do as a tv news producer my issue is what would you say from
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:30.880]  my perspective we have the hd video and we have our live stream video that my reporters with camera
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:37.840]  flags and big cameras were shot with rubber bullets and chased and attacked and it's on video of aljazeera
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:44.400]  hundreds of yards away tear gas rubber bulleted flashbang and then they chase them down and shoot
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:50.320]  them in the back with rubber bullets i mean that's criminal and i mean as a news producer did you
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:55.120]  ever hear of stuff like that because i followed news when i was a kid and been in the news for 20
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:16:00.560]  years now i've never covered something like this and we've covered it before cops just ignore you
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:05.840]  and walk past you if you don't get right up in what they're doing i've never seen police announced
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:12.080]  on loudspeakers news media turn your cameras off no see they don't have the experience and that's
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:18.240]  that's very sad if this happened in st louis that police department has a little more experience
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:23.360]  with this kind of a situation and they would have handled it a little better uh the furgson
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:28.800]  police department is a department of 50 plus officers of which there are only three african
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:37.120]  americans so it doesn't reflect the community and they have no experience with media with with this
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:45.200]  kind of altercation situation and it continues to fester out of control and our president
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:53.520]  has got to get involved in this for a number of reasons and get this thing calm down before it
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:59.040]  gets out of control i mean we're coming up in several days now and i was listening to your
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:07.920]  reporter i'm concerned about tonight as well i mean this is 22 minutes away from uh my house
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:15.920]  and where my kids are and it's a tense situation again alex it's magnified by two things inexperienced
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:21.440]  police of which there are many good ones i mean i want to make that perfectly clear they're out
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.720]  there doing their job putting their lives on the line trying to protect people and you know when
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.760]  when there's a problem we call the cops for help so there's a lot of good ones out there but they
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:37.280]  don't have the experience with this kind of massive crowd control the other problem is
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:44.400]  somebody is festering these young people they should go home i mean there's they have no business
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:50.400]  being out there screaming chanting the investigation into the death of michael brown
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:57.440]  will happen it's not going to be a wash we got to find out what's going on at this point i absolutely
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:03.600]  endorse not releasing the name of the police officer until either one he's indicted or two
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:08.240]  they've got some more information because i'm afraid the people will find out where he lives
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:14.960]  and go in there and kill a guy and again we don't know what happened well i agree with you on a lot
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:21.760]  of those issues i mean it's very balanced what you've said my only problem is i've seen the video
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:27.520]  of these police and a bunch of them are state troopers that have come in they're aiming m4
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:34.320]  m16s at josh owens my reporter who's holding a big professional camera with a press badge
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:41.600]  and pointing at him with a laser and they don't understand what they're doing they you know they
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:46.800]  think we're back in iraq or syria or someplace like that that's what i'm saying yeah the kids
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:52.240]  should go home it's not helping what's happening it's a dangerous situation but the instinct is
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:58.800]  don't back down when people are aiming lasers at you and attacking the press so what i'm saying is
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:04.400]  the system is losing the moral high ground here i don't want to see riots i don't want to see
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:09.040]  martial law i don't want to see this spread across the country i don't want to see the cops look bad
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:14.960]  we're all americans george but but this is really my gut tells me this is about to get a lot worse
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:19.760]  and i'm really concerned do you have any ideas how we could de-escalate this well let's let's
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:24.640]  hope it doesn't get worse i think the community leaders have got to step in the parents have
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:31.440]  got to step in and go up to their kids and say get the heck off the street get out of there you're
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:38.000]  not going to be there let's not fester this let's let the investigation follow let's get some real
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:44.320]  bonafide witnesses i mean that's a concern for me too that these witnesses are legit or you know
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:52.080]  are they making things up to to try to literally get this cop indicted again we don't know what
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:57.120]  happened exactly and we don't need a bunch of stuff burning down or george norris our guests
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:01.120]  we're gonna come back and talk about some key issues take with us silver has always been nature's

[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:13.360]  doing a great job that the fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:18.480]  social security would be there for you that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:23.520]  if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your

[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:27.600]  all right i want to shift gears into solar flares main line congressional studies we've had expert guests
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.240]  on covering this and george will break it down because he's he's really tried to put a national
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:38.480]  focus on it more than anybody have testified that we know repeatedly in the last 150 years
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:45.360]  we've been hit by the equivalent of emps from the sun that melted all the telegraph wires in the united
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:51.360]  states and things like that if we get hit with one of those now it's over so we're going to talk
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:55.920]  about some real threats here that don't include the american people according to homeland security
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:00.800]  with george norrie but george in this short segment i wanted to get back to what's going to happen
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:07.120]  if some crazies or other people get sick of what the police are doing aiming guns at folks
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:12.720]  they show up with guns and then the police shoot at them or they shoot back we could have a kent state
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:19.360]  kickoff here this country's a powder keg right now that's my concern that a lot of people of you
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:23.920]  ain't a aim a gun at them for no reason like happened to our josh owens reporter people are
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:30.480]  going to respond back to that and i'm just really concerned and again i wonder what are the state
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:34.320]  police thinking what are the fergis and police chief thinking he did a press conference about an
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:40.080]  hour ago i saw a clip of where they said why are your people shooting reporters and aiming guns
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:45.040]  and lasers at reporters heads and he goes that's technical that's not my responsibility well he's
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:50.160]  the police chief he's just washing his hands playing dumb he didn't know when reporters were
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:56.960]  arrested when he got asked last night about that uh i mean so i think you're right and and the feds
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:03.920]  are involved i mean this looks bad george what happens if let's say 15 people get shot five of
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:10.320]  them die i think all hell's going to break loose nationwide well it could be a serious problem
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:15.120]  and uh you know people and i've been talking about this on coast to coast alex for about a
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:21.360]  year and a half now people are upright i mean they're wound up like springs and anything could be
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:29.440]  a catalyst to explode that and i'm concerned too that some thugs show up with guns playing the part
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:36.080]  of you know posse cop come with potas uh and they're going to go ahead and start shooting at the cops
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:41.200]  and the cops are going to shoot back they're going to hit innocent people it's going to be it's going
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:48.000]  to be a disaster so i hope they can get those streets cleared and get people to go home and get
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:57.600]  on to their lives and let this investigation go and follow its course i mean i trust the prosecution
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:03.200]  out there and i think they'll do the best they can to find out what's going on and you know
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.920]  they've been sitting down with this police officer saying what the heck were you doing
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:14.160]  shooting an unarmed man and i'm sure he's saying wait a minute the guy did this he tried to pull
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:19.600]  my gun you know he reached into the car and all those things could be possible we don't know that
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:26.480]  bottom line is he made a mistake as the kid was running away he should not have shot him
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:33.360]  it was a fatal mistake in more ways than one and uh i'm concerned about it too elix i mean if some
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:38.960]  thugs show up with the guns and that's what they are and start playing the part of you know they're
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:45.280]  the vigilantes here uh it's going to get out of control and uh once a lot of innocent people get
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:51.760]  shot uh we're going to have a very serious situation but i've been through this before i've seen this
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:59.360]  happen uh eventually it does calm down people do slow down they they simply say okay but what this
[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:07.520]  does and this should be a major focus across the country is that we've got to back down on police
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:15.760]  force these guys have got to understand they are not gods and they have got to they've got to follow
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:22.320]  the law and some of them don't i mean they push people around they you know well reportedly uh
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:27.680]  this police officer saw michael brown and a friend of his walking down the street and you know he
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:33.360]  said the f board get out of the street what are you guys doing and uh things got out of control um
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:39.040]  cops have got to get back to the point and say hey you know what we're police officers we're here
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:44.160]  to defend we're here to take care of people we got to stop this stupid stuff we're doing around
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:50.800]  the country these uh checkpoints you know and i mean my god it's like we're in nazi germany give me
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:57.360]  your i was in a checkpoint in st louis uh at three o'clock in the morning uh after uh one of my shows
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:04.000]  and uh you know you you feel like you're back in nazi germany i mean what right do they have
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  to stop you uh when you haven't done anything wrong yet and uh you know they ask you these
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:15.920]  certain questions and you feel like you're guilty before you do anything that's got to stop we need
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:23.920]  to do a national review of our police force and to get them to stop doing what they've been well
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:30.000]  the elite want a force that'll suppress the public instead it's going to make the public revolt
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.920]  and no amount of police states ever going to stop the american people our whole military couldn't
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:41.280]  even hold back down no no you and you can't in police departments as this shows are not trained
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:47.760]  to handle massive crowd control and it's unfortunate that's right george norris our
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:51.760]  guests stay with us we'll be back we're on the march we're getting to mpm right ahead on the really

[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:10.000]  it's in an era of information uh and cost and affordability it's just something where people
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:17.520]  can just sit back in the comfort of their home the one domicile they still have and relax and watch
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:23.360]  some quality programming and get information from it you know it's not just a hollywood piece
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:29.520]  of good video you actually watch it learn from it and you plan your life with it well look i mean
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:35.840]  the best stuff the best stuff out there george is not on mainline cable it is in subscription now
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:42.480]  prisonplanet.tv it's on rocu and and boxy and all those systems as well i find myself now when i go
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:49.520]  on my cable or i have cable now i had satellite didn't work good when i go on there i'm going in
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:55.120]  to see your show i'm going in to see mine i'm going into my subscriptions because it's not that i'm
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:59.520]  going to subscribe to what i want to hear i see a lot of stuff on your show or other shows that
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:04.000]  don't even agree with just like people hear stuff here they don't agree with but it's it's it's not
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.800]  censored it's not centralized you turn into mainstream stuff it is just so homogenized
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:18.320]  so establishment that's why they're collapsing and we're exploding exactly it's all cookie cutter
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:23.360]  we're not you're not and the public knows that and uh they're going to get the truth they're
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:29.040]  going to get opinion like you said earlier hey people might listen to a guest on coast to coast
[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:36.000]  to be on belief for info wars and not agree with that guest but you know what that's the success
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:42.320]  of the program it gives you the right to decide what you want whether you agree with it or not
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:49.040]  you know real debate real information and that's what it's all about it really is we report you
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:54.080]  you decide it's not cookie cutter and then sometimes i start a show with one opinion
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:59.760]  and by the end i've had my mind changed it's really it's it's it's interactive that's what
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:05.680]  this is really all about and that's why there's a revolution to shut down and censor info wars
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:10.400]  and drudge and so many others there's a move to bring the fairness doctrine back into talk radio
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:14.560]  and restrict what george and i can say uh i mean there's only three hosts that have other
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:20.000]  hosts on that's michael savage george norrie alex jones the other big hosts are really in it purely
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:27.920]  as political operatives or for themselves and i'm not even attacking them it's just a fact i
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:33.280]  i know george well now over you know 12 13 years we really do want to live in a free country we
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:40.640]  really are thrilled by learning stuff and and and talking about things and the reason i bring that up
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:47.360]  is voting with your dollars and your time and your mouth and your keyboard telling people
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:53.840]  about the media you listen to and and and and where you found truth and where you found depth and
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:43:00.160]  breadth in the analysis where it's full spectrum that's the fight happening they're trying to
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:06.880]  suppress it the system is afraid of a real press we are the real press so what i'm saying is water
[02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:13.280]  the real press folks you've been doing it do it even more and celebrate the real free press
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:20.480]  celebrate a matt drudge or a george norrie or a joseph farrah or an alex jones uh or a james o kief
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:25.360]  or the countless celebrated jacari jackson or a joe bigs out there getting shot with rubber
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:31.440]  bullets i mean the these are the real warriors not the god playing football and i can watch a
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:36.400]  football game you know at a family reunion and sit back and eat pumpkin pie on thanksgiving
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:41.440]  i'm not knocking it it's just that's not my heroes i don't get excited and jump up and down
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.000]  about some football game or about the world cup even though i could watch some of it and found
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:52.240]  it interesting you know in in some of the final matches it's just that that isn't what gets my
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:56.960]  blood flowing because it doesn't matter in the final equation here i am ranting george sorry go
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:02.240]  ahead that's okay by the way you got a great compliment on my show last night from my guest
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:09.600]  why no former radio broadcaster uh complimenting you and uh paul joseph watchin for the work that
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:19.200]  the you both do on on your program and uh you know he has gone to bat defending messages from you
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:24.880]  and uh i don't know have you had him on the program yes i have i met him at a talkers conference
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:30.240]  he's got a show there on new york tv uh and just a great guy keith oberman attacked him
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:35.760]  for just promoting basic freedom which is sad for keith oberman i mean he's done some pretty
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:40.880]  journalistic stuff back in his day yeah something's happened to him too so i don't understand so
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:47.680]  this i know you don't have a lot of time here but the my campaign to insulate the power no no no
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:52.560]  in fact i apologize i've hogged the whole interview you've got the floor tell us about how big this
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:59.680]  is george this is huge this is huge and let me tell you why i decided to make this a national
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:08.000]  campaign because programs like yours and programs like mine if something happens to the power grid
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:14.400]  not only will millions of people eventually die and i'll tell you how but you're off the air
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:21.840]  i'm off the air the message stops and we cannot afford that to happen now there are some out there
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:27.040]  who may want that to happen and that's part of the issue that i continue to battle i had two
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:34.480]  guests on over the last several years f michael malouf who wrote the book a nation forsaken
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:40.560]  and william force jen who wrote the book one second after there are two distinct possibilities to
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:48.000]  shut down our power grid one is a major x flare from the sun we dodged one two years ago it went
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:52.880]  off the side of the sun had it been a direct hit with us we would have been cooked according to
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:59.840]  scientists the other is an emp attack a nation that gets a nuke and decides we're not going to
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:06.960]  blow up new york or wichita or chicago we're going to detonate a nuke in the atmosphere above the
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:14.000]  united states and that electromagnetic pulse will be strong enough to shut down the power grid of
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:22.720]  the united states for years without power everything and george i mean i know the emp is
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:27.840]  somewhat of a threat or a hack attack as well but for me statistically and reading the books having
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:32.880]  the experts on listening to you i know you cover this a lot more than i do isn't it really the sun
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:40.320]  i mean we know the earth got hit in the last 120 years multiple times by coronal mass ejections
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:45.200]  that did melt all the electronics but then there was so little electronics it didn't do much
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:52.160]  it's not if it's when it's going to happen and if it happens that we don't spend the
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:58.640]  chump change one to four billion dollars to insulate this and we can with circuit breakers and
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:04.480]  everything else we are literally fried people think okay i'm going to go to my faucet that's
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:10.480]  okay paul will be out for a month or two no it'll be out for years and then they may say well you
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:15.680]  know what i'll just you know stay in my house in the winter that no no no your furnace doesn't work
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:22.480]  you have no heat you try to go get water the company that pumps the water to your house won't
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:28.640]  have the capability of doing that anymore you can't go to the atm and get your money out because
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:34.720]  that's not working anymore it will be chaos what's happening at furgus in missouri right now
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:42.240]  is nothing compared to what will happen if an x flare or an emp shuts down the power grid of the
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:49.120]  united states and the bottom line is nobody will hear alex jones nobody will hear george norry
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:55.360]  there'll be no messages your cell phones won't work nothing will work tell folks what a carrington
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:01.200]  event is and historically we've been hit by these they think every hundred hundred and fifty years or
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:06.800]  so i mean this is just so frightening to know that it's not a question of if but when and i've
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:11.440]  seen the congressional testimony on c span i don't know you've covered but then when i talk about
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:16.560]  this i get emails saying alex why are you scaring people we're telling folks about something that
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:23.520]  is a fact this is real the carrington event happened in the 1800s the late 1800s named after
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:31.760]  scientist named carrington who registered and knew that the sun had set off a major flare i mean
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:39.040]  huge and really the only electronics of the time was the telegraph system it literally
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:47.120]  fried the wires it cooked it uh you know things burned the posts started to burn it was so big
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:52.880]  and again you know i went into a local drug store a couple years ago in st louis alex they had a
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:57.440]  power outage so they're trying to manually get everybody through the line right they couldn't
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:03.200]  do it one the tellers don't know how to add anymore you know without a computer saying you know what
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:10.000]  you gave me 15 dollars and it was 815 here's your change they can't do that and they shut down after
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:18.720]  an hour it will be the biggest catastrophe this country this world has ever seen and again for
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:25.280]  a poultry one to four billion dollars chump change with what they did in the bailout we can fix the
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:32.000]  grid we can insulate it we can protect the united states some states are already doing it on their
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:37.520]  own but it's got to be done on a national basis this is one of the best campaigns usually these
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:41.520]  campaigns oh find a cure to breast cancer it's all just feel good raise more money i'm not
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:45.680]  against that but why not find out why breast cancer is increasing so much that's what i really get
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:50.720]  behind what you're doing is one of the major threats to civilization you are targeting something
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:57.360]  that is absolutely as big a danger as nuclear war it's a reality and why wouldn't our government
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:04.080]  and other governments do what the engineers have said and put these these hubs in these transformer
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:10.240]  protectors in these surge protectors in that's what they are at the major power stations for
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:17.200]  one to four billion i mean this should have been done 50 years ago george it's national security

[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:32.720]  this is what i need i need everybody who listens to you alex to email their specific congressperson
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:37.440]  or senator not somebody outside their state because they got a system now where they can
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:44.000]  not get your email email your senator or congressperson and say you need to start
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:49.280]  thinking about legislation to insulate our power grid george norris stay there this is exactly

[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:41.520]  jump off and join the hereafter and this power grid is insurance i don't like paying insurance
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:47.440]  on my car i don't like paying insurance on my house but you know what if something happens
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:54.080]  i've got the insurance and i'm happy i did it that's what this is we need to insulate the grid
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:56:00.880]  it may not happen in our lifetime in terms of the x flare or the emp attack but it will happen
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:05.920]  and so i might happen next week it might it could happen next week could happen tonight
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:12.400]  as you buy insurance that's what it is it is nothing in terms of money if i were mark zuckerburg
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:19.840]  from facebook worth billions i'd call it bill gates and say bill we lose everything if the grid
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:26.160]  goes down for one to four billion dollars i'm just going to write a check we're going to get this
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:32.000]  on they could do it privately but what i need everybody to start doing is to educate their
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:36.880]  legislators i've got nick baggage through his brother mark baggage the senator from alaska
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:42.960]  he's looking at this now too maloof and portion are working with some legislators to try to get
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:50.080]  them more aware of what's going on to pass legislation to get it done it's a no-brainer it
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:55.120]  actually will create some jobs in this country for a little bit while they work on the insulating of
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:57:02.960]  the grid it's it's this the most important thing i think i've ever seen in my lifetime well it's
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:07.440]  it is and it's something we can do something about and all the engineers are on record
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:12.480]  congress even admits it other governments have moved somewhat in this direction all the main
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:18.240]  government facilities and things and submarines and other key weapon systems they are insulated
[02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:24.240]  they do have the surge protectors basically is what they are jumbo surge protectors and you just
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:29.920]  got to ask why hasn't it been done with the whole grid because they started building in 120 years ago
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:37.920]  130 years ago and just never really did it so it's not something we do and it's crazy that they
[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:44.000]  haven't done it because look at how solar fares blow out satellites all the time and these absolutely
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:50.640]  i mean i mean this is crazy let me do my quick impression of alex jones when an x flare hits us
[02:57:50.640 --> 02:57:54.800]  here it goes oh ladies and gentlemen alex jones on info wars dot

[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:10.640]  the x flare to come well some people do you know those globalists who want to control they have
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:18.640]  estimated close to 200 million americans will die over the course of the time that this power grid
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:24.960]  hits i mean can you imagine in the in in winter on the east coast when it gets down to zero you
