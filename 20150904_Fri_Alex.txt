[00:41.200 --> 00:46.800]  people but specifically he's got a video breakdown coming up in the next segment that is absolutely
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.960]  essential to watch also i know you miss alex but this show is absolutely jam-packed with exclusive
[00:52.960 --> 00:58.320]  key news we're going to break down the newest segments of black lives matter calling to kill
[00:58.320 --> 01:03.200]  cops the newest attacks on the police and also we're going to get into some real news not just
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.120]  distractions headlines that we have today include iran commander we're getting prepared to overthrow
[01:09.120 --> 01:15.600]  israel migrant smuggling in europe is now worth billions and from info wars dot com we have a
[01:15.600 --> 01:24.000]  massive massive stack of absolutely ludicrous news here such as shock video man dies in jail
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.760]  lobby after encounter with sheriffs deputies u.s military ordering troops in iraq to dust off
[01:29.760 --> 01:34.640]  chemical weapons suits new york clerk's office will issue marriage licenses friday without the
[01:34.640 --> 01:41.600]  clerk and a lot of other news including some economic news and the economic collapse we're
[01:41.600 --> 01:45.520]  also going to get into trump we're going to take your calls and we have a very special guest dr
[01:45.520 --> 01:50.240]  mccullough the largest natural health website in the world mccullough dot com and we're going to
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.360]  speak with the march against monsanto founder on a little bit of a short update and we're really
[01:55.360 --> 02:01.440]  going to get into key things that you can do solutions economically whether it's health or
[02:01.440 --> 02:07.120]  going along the lines of this breakdown in the economic system for example we have this from
[02:07.120 --> 02:14.480]  cns news record 94 thousand and 31 americans not in labor force participation participation rate stuck
[02:14.480 --> 02:22.160]  at 38 year low for third straight months s and p hovers near correction dow plunges triple digits
[02:22.160 --> 02:28.560]  after jobs green span the fed can't solve every problem of course not they actually create all
[02:28.560 --> 02:35.040]  of the problems and u.s. job growth growth slows unemployment rate falls to 5.1 percent obviously
[02:35.040 --> 02:39.680]  we are in a state no matter how you look at it where there is so much corruption and so much
[02:39.680 --> 02:47.280]  deception and so much collapse in all areas that it seems it seems as if there's nothing we can do
[02:47.280 --> 02:52.480]  about it but the truth of the matter is and so many people talk about oh i want positivity i want
[02:52.480 --> 02:57.680]  solutions and all this the best way is to cover these issues that's what this show is so powerful
[02:57.680 --> 03:02.560]  and doing and like i said alex is coming up next segment to cover a lot of these different issues
[03:02.560 --> 03:11.520]  he has a key breakdown actually just shot it and it all ties in with the idea that if we can really
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.960]  highlight this information we can do something about it also want to hear later on today your
[03:16.960 --> 03:22.560]  calls on trump because the newest attack on trump is that he's apparently fumbling questions on
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.920]  terrorist leaders we have the breakdown of the interview here in which he has asked about some
[03:27.920 --> 03:33.920]  of the al-qaeda type operatives and he doesn't know their name oh my and he kind of says well you
[03:33.920 --> 03:37.920]  know it's not that big of a deal because there's new al-qaeda operatives all the time and by the time
[03:37.920 --> 03:43.040]  i'm president it'll probably be an entirely different set of individuals but apparently
[03:43.040 --> 03:48.720]  the liberal media thinks that him not knowing some names of these operatives is the biggest attack
[03:48.720 --> 03:52.480]  yet as they call it so we're going to get into that we're also going to talk about
[03:52.480 --> 03:59.040]  how in some new ways we found whether or not trump is the real deal today on this broadcast i think
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.840]  what it ultimately comes down to is sifting through the distractions i mean we have these
[04:03.840 --> 04:08.560]  black lives matter individuals you know the phony ones saying that it's time to kill cops and
[04:08.560 --> 04:13.760]  obviously it's happening shooting cops at the gas station for pretty much no reason at all other
[04:13.760 --> 04:18.640]  than to kill someone so we're going to go ahead and break down all that information talk about
[04:18.640 --> 04:24.000]  well the true black lives matter quote unquote true black lives matter protesters versus the ones
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.600]  that just want to incite this type of violence and how i think we can really solve that problem
[04:29.600 --> 04:35.360]  based on the analysis of numerous experts because today we have headline mpd officer
[04:35.360 --> 04:40.160]  confronted by crowd hunched police say and in this article they talk about it's time to go on the
[04:40.160 --> 04:45.680]  offensive it's time to kill cops it's time for mass chaos so we will be back in the next segment
[04:45.680 --> 04:50.880]  with alex jones he has a key video and he's gonna also talk about some of these subjects and today
[04:50.880 --> 05:01.760]  we have his message to lewis barricade stay tuned there is a shocking video posted right now at
[05:01.760 --> 05:08.080]  info wars dot com where a man dies in a jail lobby after an encounter with sheriff's deputies
[05:08.080 --> 05:13.520]  surveillance footage released by the sheriff's department last friday shows 48-year-old arlington

[05:19.680 --> 05:25.280]  witnesses say hutchison was not violent but he appeared distraught and was seeking help he didn't
[05:25.280 --> 05:31.280]  have a weapon and he wasn't swinging at the officers witnesses say a deputy threw hutchison to the
[05:31.280 --> 05:37.200]  ground and put a knee to his throat he couldn't breathe and his face turned pale blue after a
[05:37.200 --> 05:43.120]  few moments he lied motionless as visitors continued to pour into the lobby officers are

[08:28.320 --> 08:38.480]  Ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here on this live
[08:39.200 --> 08:46.000]  September 4th Friday Worldwide Broadcast Anthony Gutiarty is going to be co-hosting the show
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.560]  today I'm going to have special reports followed throughout the transmission and we have some
[08:50.560 --> 08:56.560]  special guests as well Dr. Merkola with the largest health site alternative health site
[08:56.560 --> 09:01.920]  in the world will be breaking down some major developments coming up in the second hour today
[09:03.920 --> 09:09.840]  Ladies and gentlemen the globalist buildup towards world financial collapse
[09:11.040 --> 09:14.400]  is certainly here the planetary destabilization
[09:16.080 --> 09:23.360]  almost 15 years after 9-11 has never been more crystal clear criminal globalists within five
[09:23.360 --> 09:29.280]  private central banks are funding the anti-family the anti-free speech agenda the destruction of
[09:29.280 --> 09:35.600]  language agenda the open borders agenda the dependency agenda they are advertising free
[09:35.600 --> 09:42.240]  welfare and free family services and basically anchor baby status for anyone who can get into
[09:42.240 --> 09:47.200]  Western Europe or the United States or Canada this is causing hundreds of millions of people
[09:47.200 --> 09:52.640]  to try to get here hundreds of thousands a week trains are currently shut down in many areas of
[09:52.640 --> 09:59.680]  Europe westbound out of Eastern Europe there is just bedlam breaking out right now across the
[09:59.680 --> 10:06.320]  board and what's important to understand is this is orchestrated 15 years after the tragic events
[10:06.320 --> 10:12.160]  of 9-11 we've lost more of our liberties than ever Al Qaeda has metastasized into ISIS and
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.520]  has 200,000 people attacking our government is clearly backing them and supporting them while
[10:17.520 --> 10:23.280]  acting like they're fighting them our politicians think we're so stupid they go on the news and
[10:23.280 --> 10:29.920]  they say that we need to attack Assad because he is basically backing ISIS this is what the
[10:29.920 --> 10:36.960]  political ignorance of the people has allowed and as christ said and as the bible states multiple
[10:36.960 --> 10:45.120]  times the people perish for lack of knowledge and info wars is here just dealing out the knowledge
[10:45.120 --> 10:50.880]  breaking down the facts really trying to transcend party politics racial politics
[10:50.880 --> 10:56.400]  tribal politics and getting right down to what the social engineers are doing from their perspective
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.080]  so we can make a decision to think about what destiny we want let's just look at some of the
[11:00.080 --> 11:06.640]  headlines on info wars dot com and drudge report dot com taxpayers fleeing democrat run states for
[11:06.640 --> 11:12.400]  republican ones godfather that chicago proposes largest tax increase in modern chicago history
[11:12.400 --> 11:18.480]  94 million americans not in the labor force participation rate lowest in 77 that was a
[11:18.480 --> 11:23.840]  depression then basically a huge recession of stagflation drop in stock market futures signals
[11:23.840 --> 11:31.440]  anxiety over payroll reports rate fate green span baffled by intense focus on fed uh first
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.960]  hike folks i mean that's like saying he's baffled by farmers worried about the farm report or about
[11:36.960 --> 11:43.440]  the weather report i mean in this system where the private fellow reserve with its subsidiaries
[11:43.440 --> 11:49.520]  runs the world the imf the world bank the xn bank in this type of world where it's all based on the
[11:49.520 --> 11:56.720]  fiat system that's everything if they stop doing qe3 the economy will stall uh if they
[11:56.720 --> 12:08.240]  do raise the rates the economy will basically stall but i mean either way either way it causes
[12:08.240 --> 12:13.200]  problems because it's an artificial economy not based on real tangible assets we're going to get
[12:13.200 --> 12:19.600]  to an article that's on info wars dot com asking the question the very important question is the
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.720]  stock market too big to fail and yes we are in trouble if they do let it implode and we're in
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.680]  trouble if they continue to let it grow because it sucks in the whole economy everything else is
[12:29.680 --> 12:36.320]  based on fraud is devalued but the fortune 100 that control the stock market that are owned by
[12:36.320 --> 12:43.120]  the big banks and insurance companies they then are able to take all the new free fiat money put
[12:43.120 --> 12:48.160]  out by private central banks around the world masquerading as government institutions they get
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.960]  first use of the money and create incredible monopolies of power so they've rigged this thing
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.160]  to implode the world economy incrementally set themselves up as too big to fail we're only
[12:58.160 --> 13:03.440]  there left standing and then you look at the ideology of the globalist it's transhumanist
[13:03.440 --> 13:08.640]  it's eugenicist it's anti-human it's sell the baby parts a lot of the public it's
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.600]  feed us gmo that makes the rats sick it is feed us fluoride it's this it's this criminal attitude
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.320]  towards the people because the banks have stolen the world these handful of families
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.280]  it's less than 20 the control and run all this see the world is theirs they've stolen it through
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.400]  fraud now they want to clear it out of the seven and a half billion people and they're just trying
[13:30.400 --> 13:35.280]  to figure out how to do it first they got to bring in a worldwide collapse to get us really on our
[13:35.280 --> 13:41.760]  knees with them as the saviors before the next phase comes in but continuing here later in the
[13:41.760 --> 13:46.800]  broadcast I'm going to have a special short message to Lewis Farrakhan dealing with his meeting with
[13:46.800 --> 13:50.880]  M&M and I'm going to tell you what I really think about Lewis Farrakhan because I've had some critical
[13:50.880 --> 13:54.640]  words for Lewis Farrakhan recently and I've received some criticism from people and I want
[13:54.640 --> 14:02.000]  to be crystal clear where I stand on Lewis Farrakhan so that is coming up but but all of this news
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.320]  is really what's important the media would have us believe it's the New England Patriots quarterback
[14:06.320 --> 14:12.320]  being reinstated over deflating a hey if conspiracy theories are impossible if nobody ever involves
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.360]  in a conspiracy then it's impossible for football teams to cheat and casinos don't cheat either
[14:20.160 --> 14:25.840]  now let's get to where the rubber meets the road we can see all the things happening on the large
[14:25.840 --> 14:32.320]  overarching scale but let's look at this one article from Fox News Missouri 11 year old
[14:32.320 --> 14:38.320]  fatally shoot 16 year old intruder the mother is off having to work their house has been robbed
[14:38.320 --> 14:45.440]  repeatedly two thugs break in to rob the family the mother's off having to work the 11 year old
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.600]  shoots and kills one of the intruders runs off the other she cooperates with the investigation
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.560]  and now they're basically looking at calling in CPS because why wasn't she there will you tell
[14:56.560 --> 15:02.080]  mothers not to have men around you pay mothers welfare not to have men around and then if your
[15:02.080 --> 15:06.560]  kid's caught playing in the backyard at six o'clock in the afternoon the CPS is called or if
[15:06.560 --> 15:12.400]  you're 11 year old in other cases caught playing across the street at the park the police come
[15:12.400 --> 15:18.480]  and arrest the mother so this is how they set this up you know don't talk about guns at school
[15:18.480 --> 15:24.480]  but have all the video games that are shoot them up all day at home it's like look but don't
[15:25.680 --> 15:31.040]  touch touch but don't taste everything is a nanny state but it doesn't make us safe
[15:31.040 --> 15:37.520]  and the system knows this and so as things unravel as things degenerate as things unfold
[15:37.520 --> 15:42.320]  like this doesn't matter if the cops don't want to go after the mom they file a report and the
[15:42.320 --> 15:46.720]  higher ups that are these social engineers then basically stick them on the mother where you're
[15:46.720 --> 15:51.680]  not supposed to have your 11 year old home with a gun to defend themselves if they've been trained
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.080]  there were you know seven eight year olds on wagon trains there were you know famous cases
[15:56.080 --> 16:01.520]  like the famous story about newly freed black slaves haven't had their kids march 100 miles by
[16:01.520 --> 16:06.240]  themselves through the night to find their parents and follow a map with no weapons to defend themselves
[16:06.240 --> 16:11.520]  from wolves i guess that books wagon wheels great story it's true story this is the type of thing
[16:11.520 --> 16:16.480]  we're talking about so let robbers attack you let robbers go after you or you're abusing your
[16:16.480 --> 16:20.640]  children and it's bad to have your 11 year old defend yourself because mom's got to go out and
[16:20.640 --> 16:26.240]  work this is all about domestication that's the end game plan now when i get to my message for
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.960]  faircom later i'm going to mention this story from the Associated Press man faces charges
[16:30.960 --> 16:39.040]  that are tweeting kill all the white people in town bail set at $250,000 all i've been saying is
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.720]  some of the bloggers who've clearly said go out and attack white people and police and kill them
[16:45.440 --> 16:48.960]  have not been getting in trouble but then other people have telling me
[16:48.960 --> 16:53.360]  the folks connected to the black panther party the new black panther party and others
[16:54.480 --> 16:56.880]  not the old black panther party that was a pretty good group actually
[16:58.320 --> 17:01.520]  they have been saying and doing things that if i said it i'd be arrested
[17:02.880 --> 17:06.720]  and i'm not saying i want to say this either it's just that if i said that or you said that
[17:06.720 --> 17:12.640]  you'd be arrested so so so why is that happening why is that unfolding i'm going to cover that more
[17:12.640 --> 17:17.600]  coming up later uh after dr mccullough joins us i'm shooting a report that's a message to
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.120]  lucifer con on that front shifting gears back to the big picture i mentioned this earlier is the
[17:23.120 --> 17:28.720]  stock market now too big to fail the u.s stock market is integral to the global financial
[17:28.720 --> 17:34.720]  system in two ways and washington blog does a great job of going over all those different
[17:34.720 --> 17:40.960]  areas yes it's a bubble yes it's filled with all this fiat currency yes it's getting bigger
[17:41.600 --> 17:47.360]  but if you deflate it then that will shut the economy down but if you don't it's designed
[17:47.360 --> 17:54.320]  where only that free money only that fiat money goes into the stock market as a place to put all
[17:54.320 --> 17:59.360]  of that counterfeit and so it consolidates power for the globalist regardless and they're social
[17:59.360 --> 18:04.080]  engineers so you almost want it to come down just like we want mcdonald's to come down because
[18:04.080 --> 18:09.600]  they're a globalist genetic engineering operation just like we want the big pharma companies to
[18:09.600 --> 18:14.080]  come down even though they do some good they do very bad with their force and oculation agenda
[18:14.080 --> 18:20.880]  we want to break the gmo uh farm companies that are trying to force us to eat their gmo it's not
[18:20.880 --> 18:26.000]  that we want to break things but they're trying to dominate us they're trying to take us over
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.840]  they're trying to wreck our future they're trying to consolidate control in a scorched earth siege
[18:31.840 --> 18:38.720]  policy so it's our right to defend ourselves by voting with our dollars to shut them down
[18:38.720 --> 18:43.360]  before they shut us down that's why it's great news that coca-cola is in trouble it's great
[18:43.360 --> 18:47.840]  news that mcdonald's is in trouble it's great news that walmart's in trouble because this is the
[18:47.840 --> 18:53.200]  globalism they built and they wanted that was meant to consolidate power but now as we fall they
[18:53.200 --> 19:01.280]  fall and now as we remove our support from them they wanted us to collapse before and then they
[19:01.280 --> 19:06.560]  have the new paradigm come in when we were fully on our backs but instead we're withdrawing from
[19:06.560 --> 19:12.720]  them before the collapse is complete so they collapse first that's basically what i'm getting to
[19:12.720 --> 19:20.560]  now we don't have much time left in this segment uh but we are going to be breaking all of this down
[19:20.560 --> 19:26.640]  more in the broadcast today with special guests dr mccola uh ante gucciardi and more and i'll be back

[19:39.120 --> 19:45.200]  we do have more news as well as alex's powerful message to lewis farrakhan you will not believe

[24:13.280 --> 24:19.920]  and as alex described in the last segment we will perish for lack of knowledge and speaking of
[24:19.920 --> 24:26.160]  knowledge i have a solution for all of the hate between black lives matter protesters killing
[24:26.160 --> 24:32.000]  cops and some cops killing black lives matter protesters i have the ultimate solution and
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.480]  it has to do with knowledge i suggest that all of them go back to kindergarten if they were to go
[24:38.480 --> 24:43.760]  back to kindergarten they would have learned to respect one another at the most basic levels
[24:43.760 --> 24:48.800]  of human instinct they would have learned that tweeting kill all white people is probably not
[24:48.800 --> 24:54.320]  in the best interest of their own or of the species as a whole if they were to go back to
[24:54.320 --> 25:00.560]  kindergarten which could by the way probably be taught by a 12 year old boy they would understand
[25:00.560 --> 25:07.520]  that murdering each other is not going to further any race equality in fact the very origin of black
[25:07.520 --> 25:13.120]  lives matter versus all lives matter is the first indication that such a movement is going
[25:13.120 --> 25:18.960]  to actually cause racial divide because what's the first word black black lives matter they're
[25:18.960 --> 25:24.640]  making it more of an issue they're now saying to go out and murder white people that is not
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.720]  race equality and the article alex was talking about in the last segment when he eloquently
[25:28.720 --> 25:34.800]  broke it down was on info wars dot com right now black lives matter activists arrested for quote
[25:34.800 --> 25:41.040]  unquote kill all white people tweet suspect charge with threats of mass violence and the article
[25:41.040 --> 25:45.680]  reads police in la plata maryland have arrested man after he posted a tweet calling for the murder
[25:45.680 --> 25:51.200]  of white people in the town specifically it goes on the 20 year old charles hollands was charged
[25:51.200 --> 25:57.840]  wednesday on a 250 000 bond he tweeted quote tonight we purge kill all the white people in the town
[25:57.840 --> 26:06.640]  of la plata tonight we purge let's kill all the white people do you see how a kindergarten education
[26:06.640 --> 26:14.080]  could fix that a fundamental realization that at the most core levels of our human value system
[26:14.080 --> 26:18.320]  not not even not even a first grade second grade kindergarten the most core levels of our value
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.240]  system if we wanted all lives to matter would be to say hey let's unify let's come together who cares
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.080]  about the skin color we're all the same human being we're all the same creature on this planet
[26:28.080 --> 26:34.080]  trying to manifest our destiny which is 100 true and that's why we have a video also today from
[26:34.080 --> 26:41.920]  senator tim scott and he had the audacity to say that all lives matter oh my god cue the hillary
[26:41.920 --> 26:48.080]  laughing pen how dare he say that all lives matter how bad what a bad person only black lives
[26:48.080 --> 26:52.320]  matter apparently and he said hey if that's a that offends you if all lives matter offends you
[26:52.320 --> 26:59.440]  that's your problem let's uh play that video from cnn we'll cue it up here in a second but the point
[26:59.440 --> 27:06.480]  is all lives do matter and the biggest issue is when they make it a marginalized issue of all
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.920]  black lives matter and we see what that gets second article here to continue on what alexa
[27:11.920 --> 27:15.920]  speaking on last segment senator tim scott if all lives matter really offends you that's your
[27:15.920 --> 27:21.040]  problem we're queuing up the video on cnn tonight scott told brian a keeler if it causes a fence to
[27:21.040 --> 27:26.640]  say that all lives matter black lives white lives police officers if that is somehow offensive
[27:26.640 --> 27:33.440]  to someone that's their issue not mine i 100 agree because all police lives do matter and to
[27:33.440 --> 27:39.200]  marginalize the system with black lives matter is further causing the problem but to get away from
[27:39.760 --> 27:43.920]  we've got the clip let's go ahead and play that clip i want to ask you about something you said
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.880]  when i asked you about the black lives matter movement you said all lives matter and black
[27:48.880 --> 27:54.880]  lives matter uh people who associate with black lives matter they hear that is an oppositional
[27:54.880 --> 28:01.440]  statement to them that to them they base they hear that as saying that black there's no acknowledgement
[28:01.440 --> 28:06.880]  that black lives matter and that is something that is rebuffing their slogan i mean what when you
[28:06.880 --> 28:12.240]  say that what what are your what is your reaction to that if it's something that causes offense to
[28:12.240 --> 28:20.640]  people who are part of the movement well i will tell you that if it causes offense but i say that
[28:20.640 --> 28:30.400]  all lives matter black lives white lives police officers jurist all of us even politicians all
[28:30.400 --> 28:35.920]  of our lives matter if that is somehow offensive to someone that's their issue not mine to be
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.160]  honest with you at the end of the day what we have to do in this country i think we've seen it over
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.480]  the last couple of years we've seen a regression in race relations one of the ways that we move
[28:44.480 --> 28:49.680]  this country forward is to talk about what we have in common to find common ground on issues
[28:49.680 --> 28:54.880]  and to look into the future together to face our challenges the hiccups the potholes the walls
[28:54.880 --> 29:00.320]  and make sure that we're working together to either fill them or to remove them how dare he's
[29:00.320 --> 29:05.360]  he's not helping the racial divide by saying only black lives matter what a bad person no wait a
[29:05.360 --> 29:10.240]  minute he's black too you mean he's actually smart and he's saying we should all be together because
[29:10.240 --> 29:15.520]  we're the same exact human being oh my god and guess what we're going to come back with dr
[29:15.520 --> 29:19.440]  michaela talk about health solutions ways ways you can take control of your own health some of the
[29:19.440 --> 29:24.320]  issues he sees on the forefront and also we're going to talk about democrats in congress refuse to
[29:24.320 --> 29:29.520]  watch videos exposing planned parenthood selling aborted babies well gee maybe that's why they're
[29:29.520 --> 29:33.760]  not doing anything about it they won't even watch the videos clinton aid refusing to cooperate
[29:33.760 --> 29:39.200]  with fbi proof of server stay tuned dr michaels coming up and alex jones later in the show
[29:39.200 --> 29:41.680]  responds with a powerful message to lewis farrakhan
[29:48.400 --> 29:55.120]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:55.120 --> 30:04.400]  we're being told that snowden's window for a plea bargain deal is closing bloomberg reports a national
[30:04.400 --> 30:08.720]  security specialist saying many people in government believe that journalists who receive snowden's
[30:08.720 --> 30:14.800]  material are not capable of protecting it from a competent and committed state level adversary
[30:14.800 --> 30:19.040]  even if snowden did not give the material to others they argue it would have been ripe for the
[30:19.040 --> 30:24.480]  picking well isn't that true of hillary's handling of emails didn't her violation of protocol expose
[30:24.480 --> 30:31.360]  above top secret data to state level adversaries snowden exposed criminal actions of our government
[30:31.360 --> 30:37.840]  done in the name of national security hillary compromised national security for her own convenience
[30:37.840 --> 30:44.400]  or to cover up her misdeeds if national security is more important than the constitution if national
[30:44.400 --> 30:51.280]  security is more important than our rights why isn't hillary being prosecuted why is snowden

[34:53.520 --> 34:58.640]  yes the shilajit is truly an insane ingredient it actually comes from the himalayan rocks and when
[34:58.640 --> 35:04.640]  they quote unquote breathe or sweat it produces shilajit so it takes a long time for these rocks
[35:04.640 --> 35:10.720]  to kind of create that shilajit another one from shon in ohio was really wondering about the deep
[35:10.720 --> 35:14.880]  cleanse product and was rather shocked with the result i had a great influx of awareness at about

[36:10.240 --> 36:14.480]  at me so first and foremost i want to ask you what's on your radar i want to know what the
[36:14.480 --> 36:20.800]  number one health topic for you is right now i don't know if we've singled out any specific one
[36:20.800 --> 36:26.320]  other than helping people understand the massive corruption that's available in the industries
[36:27.040 --> 36:34.560]  that seek to deceive and manipulate their understanding of the reality so that they
[36:34.560 --> 36:40.000]  are not able to make intelligent choices about how to control their health right and that seems
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.200]  prevalent it seems like everywhere you turn you have a monsanto or you have a general mills or
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.560]  you have a craft and it seems like so many people at the same time though are really awakening to
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.520]  all of these issues from so many different fronts with the political front with the economic front
[36:55.520 --> 37:00.640]  to the health front do you think that we're really making a lot of progress oh we're definitely
[37:00.640 --> 37:06.320]  making progress uh you can just see what's happened recently with respect to uh well
[37:06.320 --> 37:10.720]  monsanto let's take monsanto for example one of the most pernicious evils on the planet
[37:10.720 --> 37:19.280]  who has uh understands that they that their name has been associated with uh you know definitely
[37:19.280 --> 37:25.200]  negative public perception so in their effort to change that they sought out to buy singenta
[37:25.200 --> 37:31.280]  last week initially offered them 42 billion that's billion with a b billion dollars and that wasn't
[37:31.280 --> 37:36.640]  enough singenta said back said we need five percent more so they they're offered a 47 billion
[37:36.640 --> 37:41.440]  dollars not only that they gave them a seven dollar seven billion dollar poison pill so the
[37:41.440 --> 37:47.920]  fdc decided that they couldn't join singenta would get seven billion dollars unfortunately or
[37:47.920 --> 37:54.880]  fortunately singenta's board of directors wisely decided to not go for that deal which
[37:54.880 --> 38:00.480]  was a major victory because that would have been a disaster so that's a good one right and monsanto
[38:00.480 --> 38:06.080]  lost 128 million dollars last fourth quarter in 2014 i think they've been down 35 percent yeah
[38:06.080 --> 38:09.600]  they're continually down just like mcdonald's and subway and so on and so forth and they're
[38:09.600 --> 38:15.040]  trying to buy singenta because singenta i think is even a next step above monsanto singenta is
[38:15.040 --> 38:19.040]  what we're going to be hearing about in the next couple years with their biopharmaceutical crops
[38:19.040 --> 38:23.840]  all the stuff they're doing in the medical field that even trumps in many ways what monsanto is
[38:23.840 --> 38:29.840]  doing so it's almost like a little evil baby trying to swallow up a goliath of singenta which
[38:29.840 --> 38:34.880]  which i think will be even bigger on the forefront and speaking about gmos and monsanto
[38:34.880 --> 38:39.120]  i have some headlines here i also noticed on marcolla.com you have a good headline
[38:39.120 --> 38:42.960]  is the public health ramifications of gmos and herbicides and i also want to get into your
[38:42.960 --> 38:47.520]  story on the new scientific analysis which concern can uh firm saturated fats have no
[38:47.520 --> 38:51.920]  link to heart disease which is something you've been talking about for what decades now and i
[38:51.920 --> 38:56.640]  know you were under five steps over about close to 20 years yeah and i mean you were under fire
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.280]  for that for so many years i mean you had so many attacks and now they're all being forced to admit
[39:01.280 --> 39:05.440]  you were 100 right how does that mean how many times does that happen it seems like it happens
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.640]  over and over again doesn't it happens pretty regularly uh it's it's a consistent pattern uh
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.520]  and they're just it's it's not necessarily related to health it's just anyone who's
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.800]  opposed to the traditional way of thinking any field undergoes this the same type of reaction but
[39:20.800 --> 39:25.040]  if you're careful in your objective and you critically analyze the data it's pretty clear
[39:27.040 --> 39:33.280]  that what the direction of health should be so we know it reminds me also sorry i want
[39:33.280 --> 39:36.720]  when you finish the second year but it reminds me also in the vein of being right and being
[39:36.720 --> 39:41.840]  proven right the study from the new york daily news that cell phone radiation is actually giving
[39:41.840 --> 39:46.720]  you brain tumors and i'm sure you were speaking about that years and years ago and as was i and
[39:46.720 --> 39:50.560]  i remember sitting in a doctor's office one time speaking to somebody about it and they said you're
[39:50.560 --> 39:54.480]  one of those conspiracy theorists that doesn't use their cell phone all the time aren't you and i
[39:54.480 --> 39:58.000]  said well yeah it's not good to put your cell phone up your brain at all times for hours and hours
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  a day it it microwaves your brain it gives you brain tumors like your magnetic radiation
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.680]  and yeah even the world health organization in 2011 they classified cell phone radiation as a class
[40:07.680 --> 40:15.360]  2b carcinogen which means possible human carcinogen and and glyphosate was just last year classified
[40:15.360 --> 40:23.120]  as a class 2a which means probable human carcinogen so uh you know it's definitely and the other
[40:23.120 --> 40:28.240]  important thing to consider about glyphosate or is that it's the main ingredient around up but
[40:28.240 --> 40:34.800]  uh there's a number of experts i mean true scientific gurus who really studies their whole
[40:34.800 --> 40:40.720]  life study and when they look at it like dr don huber dr serolini and they look at it carefully
[40:41.280 --> 40:48.480]  round up the ingredient that's actually sprayed on the crops is far more toxic than glyphosate
[40:48.480 --> 40:54.320]  it's because of the surfactants they put in there which which are even more uh pernicious to health
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.720]  so it's it's a pretty nasty situation right and like you said the world health organization is
[40:58.720 --> 41:03.120]  already classified round up as a probable carcinogen because of its glyphosate yes because
[41:03.120 --> 41:08.400]  of its glyphosate which monsanto owns anyway so they just make a mega dose version of it they make
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.480]  like a glyphosate on steroids and that is of course what's sprayed on all the gmo crops
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.440]  and then even if you argue oh maybe gmo's are safe because of the manipulation it might only
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.280]  cause sterility in the next few generations or some crazy argument right well it's the round
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.760]  up that's also giving you the cancer but the reason i also mentioned the cell phone thing
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.600]  is because there was a new study that came out today that your cell phone screens could be giving
[41:29.600 --> 41:34.880]  you skin cancer i mean it just goes on and on and on and on so speaking of all the things that are
[41:34.880 --> 41:39.440]  giving us cancer and killing us my whole thing is as long as you're making an effort as long as
[41:39.440 --> 41:44.240]  you're trying to eat organic as long as you're trying to avoid the toxic fillers drinking purified
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.760]  water taking the right supplements you're better off than about 99.9 percent of the public i believe
[41:49.760 --> 41:54.560]  and i think it's it's impossible to avoid everything so what are your most key tips to give everyone
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.800]  listening right now on ways that you can really avoid all the toxic fillers and try and take your
[41:58.800 --> 42:04.480]  health into your own hands well it's really quite simple the three simple words is to eat real food
[42:05.360 --> 42:09.840]  and that's a pretty comprehensive statement because when you eat real food you avoid processed
[42:09.840 --> 42:15.440]  foods and processed foods have tens of thousands of chemicals that don't even have to be labeled
[42:15.440 --> 42:20.800]  because they've been categorized by industry trade groups as grass which only recognizes safe
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.520]  even though they've never been tested for human safety so you avoid all these tens of thousands
[42:25.520 --> 42:31.440]  of chemicals if you eat real food someone either yourself your spouse or someone you pay needs to
[42:31.440 --> 42:36.160]  invest some time in preparing that food in the kitchen every day so eat real food is the key
[42:36.160 --> 42:41.600]  thing and then move you need to move even if you're working out every day for an hour a day
[42:41.600 --> 42:45.920]  and incredibly fit and if you're sitting down at a desk and i know alex understands as he
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.640]  implemented in this whole whole whole team over there that you've got to move around you should
[42:50.640 --> 42:55.360]  be standing up you should be walking so walking seven ten thousand steps a day you know four or
[42:55.360 --> 42:59.200]  five miles a day is really an essential part because we were designed to move so if you and
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.680]  then you have to sleep of course most of us don't sleep enough i violated this rule for many years
[43:03.680 --> 43:09.520]  of my life thought i was i was somehow exempt but it was only getting five hours for decades but now
[43:09.520 --> 43:15.520]  i try pretty much average eight and a half hours so you've got to get enough good sleep clean water
[43:15.520 --> 43:19.680]  like you mentioned eat real food and get their movement and then exercise you know speaking
[43:19.680 --> 43:24.480]  of sleep and speaking of the other characteristics too but i thought the same thing i i really don't
[43:24.480 --> 43:28.160]  like to go to sleep i like to stay up all night if i can you know i'll just sit there on the computer
[43:28.160 --> 43:32.640]  reading about news and stuff so there's tons of stuff to do there's tons of stuff to do in this
[43:32.640 --> 43:37.440]  ever-evolving insane world right where everyone's shooting cops and everything so i like to stay
[43:37.440 --> 43:42.560]  up maybe you know two a.m sometimes the problem is i try to wake up at seven a.m and i wake up
[43:42.560 --> 43:47.600]  and i think i'm fine but then during the day i'll notice i'll be emotionally out of whack and i
[43:47.600 --> 43:53.120]  always fail to correlate it sleeping is such a big deal and if you have something like sleep apnea
[43:53.120 --> 43:57.360]  you're not getting any real sleep and it just really really messes you up and at the same time
[43:57.360 --> 44:03.280]  people don't understand it's it's it's it's it's a it a hormonal level too people are so upset
[44:03.280 --> 44:08.240]  and so mad i was in a parking lot the other day and i was just parking and i stopped for like one
[44:08.240 --> 44:11.520]  second to look at something to the left of me someone was walking or something and this woman
[44:11.520 --> 44:16.480]  starts screaming screaming at me f you screaming at me blaring a horn because i stopped for like
[44:16.480 --> 44:22.400]  two milliseconds and it's people like that that unfortunately are sick they're constipated their
[44:22.400 --> 44:26.640]  hormones are out of whack and they don't even know what real food is you know they don't think it
[44:26.640 --> 44:31.120]  happened at austin wasn't i guess i didn't think that happened at austin believe it or not it does
[44:31.120 --> 44:38.240]  happen in austin this also is definitely better off in many areas but overall i mean so let's
[44:38.240 --> 44:42.320]  say someone goes into a grocery store though what do they avoid i mean some really tips for the
[44:42.320 --> 44:47.440]  audience because most people will say okay eat real food what's real food well real food is food
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.480]  that hasn't been manipulated or processed and it's typically not in a package so that's typically
[44:52.480 --> 44:56.320]  generally food around the peripheral you know the middle of the store is designed where all the
[44:56.320 --> 45:01.360]  processed foods are so anything that's processed and has a label on it that has a long list of
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.040]  ingredients many of the words that you get are very difficult to read unless you've had some
[45:05.040 --> 45:11.040]  scientific training are typically foods you want to avoid so you can have some of them occasionally
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.480]  you know but the bulk of majority of your food needs to satisfy that criteria you know so that
[45:16.480 --> 45:22.640]  could be fruits and vegetables and and you have to be careful of the meats because many of the
[45:22.640 --> 45:28.000]  meats are available in traditional commercial grocery stores are k-folk and can find animal
[45:28.000 --> 45:34.720]  feeding operations which are fed the processed foods the gmo grains and and given the uh
[45:34.720 --> 45:39.200]  antibiotics you know 80 percent of the antibiotics being used in the country are given to animals
[45:39.200 --> 45:44.000]  so you don't want to get them indirectly through the meat that you're eating so and then eggs ideally
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.960]  from cage-free animals you know that are locally grown which are relatively easy to find uh in
[45:48.960 --> 45:53.520]  most communities and if you don't know where they are you go to health food store contact the local
[45:53.520 --> 45:58.240]  western price chapter and they'll connect you up with the source of local food that is healthy
[45:58.240 --> 46:02.080]  and can nourish you and your family well dr mccullough you're kind of like the grand master
[46:02.080 --> 46:05.840]  of nutrition what do you eat on a daily basis what do you eat for breakfast what did you have the day
[46:07.280 --> 46:12.720]  well um it's not only what you eat anthony it's the timing that you eat what i've learned recently
[46:12.720 --> 46:19.840]  is just that to restrict your the food that you eat within about an eight hour window so and and
[46:19.840 --> 46:23.840]  you could either skip breakfast or skip dinner i think i used to say skipping breakfast was was
[46:23.840 --> 46:27.760]  a wise strategy but i've come to realize the skipping dinner is probably more useful because
[46:27.760 --> 46:32.400]  then you'll be fasting longer when you go to bed you really don't want any food in your system for
[46:32.400 --> 46:37.200]  at least four four to four hours i would say three would be minimum but four or five would be even
[46:37.200 --> 46:44.560]  better so i pretty pretty much my last meal is about three o'clock and i'll typically wake up and
[46:44.560 --> 46:49.840]  do my dental hygiene and then i'll have some fruit now i'm having clementine tangerines and
[46:49.840 --> 46:56.800]  mandarin oranges which are really good and then i'll have some rice and sunflower seeds sprouts
[46:56.800 --> 47:05.360]  and avocado some sesame seeds so hey let me let me switch gears up a little bit and talk about
[47:05.360 --> 47:10.400]  how where you see all this going because obviously you know you've got your lifestyle in check a lot
[47:10.400 --> 47:14.080]  of people are doing so they're getting their lifestyles in check they're following these
[47:14.080 --> 47:18.080]  protocols like you said fasting i mean it's been it's been used for thousands and thousands of
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.400]  years as a natural detoxification method that's what people do that's what they did for years and
[47:22.400 --> 47:27.280]  years and years but many parts and genes are designed for their optimize for them if you
[47:27.280 --> 47:34.000]  don't do that you're going to to uh not have optimal functioning for sure what makes sense i mean
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.440]  you're only going to eat if you're hunting for food you're only going to eat you're not going to
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.920]  sit there and glut on deer for 24 hours every single day you're going to have a hunt and
[47:41.920 --> 47:44.960]  you're going to eat some deer every now and then and then you're not you're going to forge for some
[47:44.960 --> 47:50.400]  vegetables you know it makes a lot more sense than glutting all day but in the in the grand realm of
[47:50.400 --> 47:56.080]  things with the opposition to the gmo's with the opposition to the toxic fillers with the reception
[47:56.080 --> 48:00.640]  now of super high quality organic foods with the you know reception of organic supplementation
[48:00.640 --> 48:08.640]  everything overall in the next five years what do you see as a prediction well i think there's
[48:08.640 --> 48:12.960]  going to we have continuous victories though that we're seeing and more people are becoming
[48:12.960 --> 48:18.960]  aware of these and will and because it's difficult to suppress truth for long periods of times i mean
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.160]  they certainly can do it they did this successfully with the cigarettes for for nearly a century or
[48:24.160 --> 48:30.400]  so but interestingly many of these same organizations big soda uh monsanto they're using the same
[48:30.400 --> 48:36.800]  front groups and and pr groups to disseminate their lives so they can confuse people for a while but
[48:36.800 --> 48:43.440]  eventually people like alex and your your side and mine and others inform people the truth and
[48:43.440 --> 48:47.600]  because we have these new tools and technology like the internet which allows us to circumvent
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.160]  traditional media which is typically bought out by these large corporate interest groups so i think
[48:52.160 --> 48:58.160]  we'll see a wider adoption of these the truthful pieces of information which will allow people to
[48:58.160 --> 49:01.840]  prevent chronic degenerative diseases i would agree completely and you are right sites like
[49:01.840 --> 49:06.480]  mercola dot com info wars dot com my site natural society dot com all these alternative news power
[49:06.480 --> 49:11.360]  houses we put out articles and i know on your site and on info wars and natural study mean
[49:11.360 --> 49:17.280]  oftentimes there's 500 000 shares on facebook on some of these with the dark act which would make gmo
[49:17.280 --> 49:21.760]  labeling mandatory gmo labeling illegal in the united states i wrote an article for that up on
[49:21.760 --> 49:26.800]  info wars and natural society and each of which have about 100 000 shares and i've seen your posts
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.280]  on mercola dot com just go mega mega viral it shows that people want the truth they want the
[49:31.280 --> 49:37.280]  information and an interesting new development i think is legal action to do so in a big new way
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.840]  and here's a headline department of agriculture sues for withholding safety information on gm
[49:41.840 --> 49:45.680]  crops the department of agriculture has been violating the freedom of information act for
[49:45.680 --> 49:50.560]  over 13 years according to the center for food safety who is now suing the agency for withholding
[49:50.560 --> 49:55.600]  information on the lack of safety of gmo crops the center for food safety filed a suit against
[49:55.600 --> 50:00.880]  the u.s agriculture animal and planet health service and they basically are saying that the
[50:00.880 --> 50:06.160]  jig is up and they are going to do something about it fast do you think legal action is really
[50:06.160 --> 50:13.200]  going to work in this case and in closing i think it's it's a i'm not sure if legal actions the
[50:13.200 --> 50:18.160]  correct approach but certainly political actions were using the same strategies i mean these large
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.240]  multinational corporations have been using these strategies for many many decades and they work
[50:24.240 --> 50:28.320]  that's why they use them they're they're not stupid they're very strategic and very clever so
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.720]  i think that many of us are starting to understand that and employ very similar strategies to to
[50:32.720 --> 50:37.280]  making it influences i mean they because it's not just lawsuits it's far more comprehensive
[50:37.280 --> 50:42.080]  strategies that you have to do to engage the behavior absolutely i think we are making
[50:42.080 --> 50:46.480]  strides making victories dr baccala we're going to come back in the next segment and talk about
[50:46.480 --> 50:55.440]  more news alex jones's powerful message to lewis farrakhan is also coming up in the show and much more stay

[54:18.160 --> 54:23.440]  recorded today that you do not want to miss we're here with dr mccullough of mccullough.com and we're
[54:23.440 --> 54:27.600]  going to get into some news next segment we're going to come back and talk about a scuffle between

[54:48.400 --> 54:52.720]  happy news that we're going to cover and some really really shocking stuff on info wars dot com
[54:52.720 --> 54:56.960]  right now but dr mccullough you were telling me that you have some really really powerful
[54:56.960 --> 55:01.600]  information on coca-cola that you wanted to reveal on air so please tell me about that
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.720]  yeah we just had some uh it wasn't actually covered in the new york times which is good
[55:06.720 --> 55:12.400]  you know so it's getting a wide exposure but you know one of the common strategies that large
[55:12.400 --> 55:17.600]  industry will use either drug companies or just as equally the food industry in this case big soda
[55:17.600 --> 55:22.320]  is they have something called astroturfing which means they create these front groups that looks
[55:22.320 --> 55:28.000]  like they're beneficial to the to the community and they're really serving the public but when
[55:28.000 --> 55:33.920]  they're nothing more than front groups for for the the industry that's funding them and and the
[55:33.920 --> 55:40.720]  big exposure was this this global energy balance network if you could i think we published this
[55:40.720 --> 55:45.680]  the article on friday uh wednesday i'm sorry today's friday wednesday and it's really interesting
[55:45.680 --> 55:50.960]  they had uh the the the strategy that the soda companies are used because they're getting a
[55:50.960 --> 55:54.960]  lot of flak for this in the in the media and actually mary and nestles coming out with a
[55:54.960 --> 56:00.320]  great book in october 15th i believe it's called soda polishes which goes into this great detail
[56:00.320 --> 56:06.960]  and i'm going to be interviewing her for that launch uh is uh that the uh they have these behind
[56:06.960 --> 56:12.480]  this these the same same activities in front of these astroturf groups and this they're getting
[56:12.480 --> 56:18.240]  a lot of flak though for this the commonly widespread appreciation understanding that
[56:18.240 --> 56:24.320]  sodas are responsible it's actually the video below that which is really really good i don't
[56:24.320 --> 56:28.320]  know if you could just show that it's really absolutely we'll get on screen yes that's because
[56:28.320 --> 56:34.240]  you got to see this guy steven blair yeah there it is if you're watching on prismplanet.tv
[56:34.240 --> 56:38.720]  we're on macohla.com highlighting the article right now he is the spokesperson for the global
[56:38.720 --> 56:42.960]  energy network and he he looks like about the least healthy spokesperson you can possibly be
[56:42.960 --> 56:48.160]  but the emphasis they just freeze it there you can take a look at them but it's the it's really
[56:49.120 --> 56:54.560]  shocking because they want you to believe that it's not about drinking soda at all it's just
[56:54.560 --> 57:00.080]  because you aren't moving enough now there is some truth to the fact that we don't move enough
[57:00.080 --> 57:05.440]  well dr coli calories in calories out there's no such thing as good or bad food you're a conspiracy
[57:05.440 --> 57:11.200]  theorist you don't want to eat trans fat and aspartame and gmo and roundup calorie in calorie out
[57:11.200 --> 57:14.800]  yeah that's the conventionally taught thing and if you go lower down to the page you'll see a one
[57:14.800 --> 57:20.400]  hour lecture by zoe harkome i also interviewed phenomenal researcher from the uk she's a phd
[57:20.400 --> 57:26.400]  uh initially in i think physics or or math mathematics and wrote this book but i've never
[57:26.400 --> 57:33.520]  seen a more definitive destruction of that whole component of calories in less calories
[57:33.520 --> 57:37.520]  and more activity is the answer to weight loss i mean it has to do with this if you go into the
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.880]  details of second law of thermodynamics and it's just it's just so seriously flawed and if you
[57:42.880 --> 57:47.600]  listen to her lecture you'll go into much because much more details if you still believe that myth
[57:47.600 --> 57:53.040]  so uh that is uh something that i would uh you know it's it's really interesting that
[57:53.040 --> 57:56.960]  we you know it's just another area where we're starting to see some good progress in that respect
[57:56.960 --> 58:01.680]  no absolutely and it seems like time and time again we have to break that myth that all food
[58:01.680 --> 58:05.840]  is created equal and it reminds me of it might have been coca-cola it might have been pepsi though
[58:05.840 --> 58:11.440]  paying off health leaders to say that it's a healthy drink you just have to exercise more
[58:11.440 --> 58:15.440]  and i don't know about you dr. micola but i'm certainly not paid off by coca-cola or pepsi
[58:15.440 --> 58:19.760]  to say it's healthy and i'm going to tell the truth on air and i know you do too and thank you
[58:19.760 --> 58:24.320]  for fighting all of this and in closing a final statement that you'd like to make in terms of all
[58:24.320 --> 58:29.120]  this well this to know that you can take control of your health i mean you have the opportunity

[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:56.640]  she's also laughing because she is a hardcore supporter of monsanto in fact she lobbied for them

[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.400]  about some news such as how the democrats in congress refused to watch videos exposing
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.720]  Planned Parenthood selling aborted babies. feds want evidence they let mexican drug
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.640]  cartels buy guns kept quiet and of course alex's premier response and powerful message to louis
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.720]  ferrican but first tami canal of march against monsanto how are you doing hi anthony i'm doing
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.600]  good how are you great well thanks for joining and first and foremost a little bit about march
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.600]  against monsanto why don't you explain to the viewers what march against monsanto is
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:47.680]  and the powerful message on how you really started it um march against monsanto is an education
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.200]  and awareness-based organization we're trying to really let the masses know what's going on with
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:02:00.240]  our food supply the toxic chemicals being used to grow it and um monsanto's collusion with our
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.520]  government uh that is basically um selling the people of this country down the river right
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.800]  and i've supported march against monsanto for years because i think it's a great group
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.280]  and really what it is it's a grassroots movement which is key i mean it's grassroots i mean you
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.120]  you are i believe a stay-at-home mother right and you started this because you didn't want to give
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.160]  your kids gmo junk like dr mccullough just said the world health organization has already admitted
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.600]  roundup is causing cancer it's a mega glyphosate on steroids and that's what's put on all these gmo
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.560]  foods and you have the audacity by the way how dare you to say that you don't want to eat monsanto's
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.920]  gmo's so you started a grassroots movement that's now reached what tens and tens of millions worldwide
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:44.800]  your reach on social media is like 50 million a month i mean it's just gone massive yeah it's
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.800]  it's really incredible i think that um the more people know they can't go back um and that's really
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.960]  the big point uh behind the education uh things like the dark act uh that are basically going to
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:03.040]  happen if we don't stand up and fight monsanto spent 30 million dollars to get the house to vote yes
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:09.360]  on the dark act when 94 of the people in this country want labeling and um i mean personally
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:17.120]  labeling to me is a is a a sad band-aid on a severe injury labeling doesn't solve the problem of the
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.720]  b crisis and it doesn't solve the problem of cross contamination and it also legitimizes the use of
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:29.360]  chemicals like roundup and the newly approved 240 which is even more of um uh glyphosate on
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:35.840]  steroids as you put it so um we are just trying to educate people um to what to what is happening
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:43.680]  and uh we are doing a an event in dc on october 16th and 17th and we really would love for the
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.960]  country to come together and descend on our politicians backyard and make them uncomfortable
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.480]  and let them know we're not going to go quietly in the night we we are going to get the change we
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.160]  are demanding that's exactly right and march against monsanto already has the backing of
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.240]  celebrities and certain politicians and everything like that but your food justice march in dc in
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.240]  october is super is going to be super big i'm already hearing that a number of celebrities
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.880]  are most likely going to be attending and promoting it and overall all of this comes down to i mean
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.720]  the dark act which would ban gmo labeling mandatory gmo labeling in the united states
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.000]  all this comes down to fierce opposition i mean what you have done is amazing with your grass

[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:28.880]  so stay tuned and right now what we're going to do is i'm going to break down the facade of the
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:35.920]  mainstream media system right here and right now and what i'm going to show you is north korea's
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.920]  mysterious fake town and how that exactly relates to the current media system in the united states
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:49.280]  for those who are unaware on the dm mz the d militarized zone in south korea and north korea
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:54.960]  where there is a meeting of about a mile wide between the two countries there's a lot of insanity
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:01.680]  that goes on north korea has an entire fake town set up and they call it propaganda town
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.880]  new york post has an article on it it's called the mysterious fake town on north korea's border
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.760]  it reads from the outside the north korea village of kijong dong looks like any other town or at
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.160]  least painted houses schools daycares and even a hospital but on close and inspection it's not all
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:23.120]  it seems says sitting in the heavily guarded dmz that separates north and south korea kijong dong
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:28.080]  is widely referred to as the propaganda village and is believed to be a decoy for lowering south
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:35.040]  korean defectors they just spam constant propaganda in this facade they say the two and a half mile
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.480]  wide dmz that was set up in 1953 as an arm assist to end the korean war the town claims to have 200
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:47.040]  residents and boasts an image of economic success that's the key right there this town obviously
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:53.440]  is completely fake it is set up to act like north korea has an amazing economy and we they have
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:59.680]  plenty of food and everything is amazing the economy is going to be just fine in fact do you
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.880]  know what the north koreans who would potentially say that kim jong-un is not their god and that the
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.960]  economy is totally in ruins would be called they would be called conspiracy theorists and they would
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:17.840]  be killed in north korea in the united states we are living in a facade we are living in a world
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:24.000]  in which we are told by the media what to think and what to believe as many of you know this
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.880]  facade in north korea is so similar to the united states in the sense that if you are to question
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.760]  the reality that is given to you of course you would be attacked if you laugh that you'll be
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.880]  attacked and you'll be criticized the reality is though that we can escape this facade system and
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.680]  we can know what is really going on and that's why we here on the alex joneshow and what alex
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:51.120]  does every single day is cover this news over and over and over again that's why you have the dow
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.600]  playing a yo-yo system there's so much deception going on behind the scenes it's just like this
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:02.240]  north korea facade and this this informational outpost on the dmz which is the alex joneshow
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:08.880]  and infowars.com acts as kind of a tower in on behind enemy lines to kind of sniff out what's
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.000]  going on if you think about it for a minute and you realize and what i'm tying this into
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.920]  that the media acts as this mysterious town to act as if it's huge act as if it's big act as if
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:26.480]  it's the only voice out there but the truth of the matter is i would estimate about 70 after
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.200]  speaking to the experts of people obviously this listening audience but in people of the united
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:37.040]  states are fed up with it and they are not buying the lie anymore what that means is the mainstream
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.000]  media system like this mysterious fake town in north korea is just in shambles it is nothing
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.800]  more than a facade and we are crashing through it with a massive informational sledgehammer just
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:53.200]  plowing through it over and over and over again and that i believe is the core issue with all
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:12:00.000]  this insanity going on that the media is making you believe and making you think that white people
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.200]  are evil kill all the whites that the black lives matters it's chaos in the streets it's insanity
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.680]  that's the only issue the immigration issue is the only issue trump is bad because he wants to
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.280]  deport legal immigrants all of this stuff is manufactured reality and i want to get on that
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:22.720]  get on those subjects right now on the immigration issue because as this article talks about it is
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:31.040]  now a billion plus dollar industry in the smuggling realm smuggling and immigrants is a billion plus
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.920]  dollar industry they're making billions and billions of dollars and then we have whore hey ramos
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.280]  this is from the los angeles times whore hey ramos is on the defensive over his role as
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.080]  journalist and immigration immigrant advocate after a testy encounter with donald trump at a
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.160]  press conference last week univision anchor whore hey ramos has found himself on the defensive
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.760]  trying to explain how his self-proclaimed position as an advocate for immigration reform
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.720]  does not undercut his role as a journalist and he's saying i'm a journalist i i i have no actual
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.120]  activism in this immigration is all just me trying to be a true journalist and talk to trump
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:11.120]  and it's just it's they act as if you are some type of satan worshiper for not wanting
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.920]  illegal immigrants in the united states while also saying we love hispanic people that come here
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.040]  legally we love everyone from mexico that actually goes through and does the test and and does all
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.360]  that information i mean i was speaking to someone from germany the other day and they they came here
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:30.000]  legally and they went through all the processes and they had said to me what upsets me and this
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.320]  guy was like literally cheering up and this happens often what upsets me is those that ruin it for
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:39.840]  everyone else and i said what do you mean by that he said it upsets me having to go through all
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:45.920]  this process to come here legally and bring my family here he's married now is to have these
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:51.040]  illegals running over the border i mean making everyone else look bad making real true immigrants
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.320]  look bad i mean my family has only been here for a couple generations we came from italy
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:01.440]  we're all horrible evil people right but no we came here legally and have actually helped input
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:08.320]  and generate economy but at the same time there's hundreds thousands i guess of illegal immigrants
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:13.520]  crossing borders and what's in other nations in europe right now as we speak paul watson's
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.760]  investigating it and they are just telling them you better bring them water and give me your house
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.960]  or you're a bad person that's how this ties into the media facade i don't think that people
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:29.600]  are buying it i also want to talk about a video that we're going to play here of this 911 call
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:36.880]  or a dispatch report and talk about the insanity in the media and what it results in the byproduct
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:44.160]  of this insanity is cops being killed is black lives matter protesters blocking highways for no
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:50.000]  reason is shooting and killing white people because they're white is attenuating the fact
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.360]  that black lives matter and not all lives matter i want to play this video and really see what
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.440]  happens when the media gets all fired up about these race issues that we should all be celebrating
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:05.840]  our own lives and humanity as a whole but when they get all fired up about these race issues
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.840]  here's the type of thing that happens let's play this video
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.640]  looks like the male that called it in assaulted
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:23.520]  his wife and child so possibly two patients and he is also threatening suicide so possibly three
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.520]  patients they are talking to the subject now he's outside talking to them and he has a knife in his
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:38.000]  hand so mark it sounds like this all started as a domestic call right what more do we know about
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.880]  flores right well it began as a domestic call officer deputies were dispatched to the scene
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:51.280]  around 11 30 a.m. on friday now they arrived and found a woman with a gash in her head holding a
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.560]  baby who may have also been injured and reports indicate that flores was outside and was armed
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:04.640]  with a knife at the time apparently there was a lengthy confrontation prior to the actual shooting
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:11.360]  that is not seen in the video that was played by our local tv but exactly what happened in the time
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.840]  leading up to shots being fired is still unclear at this point right and that's what michael's
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.880]  right and it says right there suspect threatened suicide by cop there is this insane narrative
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.480]  of pinning up against each other the police and obviously anyone pretty much in the world right
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.720]  now there's there's so much hatred towards the cops and on the flip side there's so much hatred
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.960]  from the cops and cop supporters against protesters or activists or whatever you want to call them i
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:42.000]  think really people that kill anyone are just savages period whether they're a cop or a citizen it
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.880]  does not really matter but all this does is pin people up against each other and then we have the
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:55.360]  issue of transgendered students that also ties into this media facade the media loves to talk about
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:02.480]  transgendered issues they don't love to talk about the economy and jobs collapsing all over the place
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.680]  and the dow playing a yo-yo because it's completely manipulated watch as the dow crashes and silver
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.920]  goes down at the same time which historically makes no sense and gold goes down it's completely
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.560]  manipulated completely corrupt and you have people making billions and billions of dollars every time
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.400]  it goes down every time it goes up because they know how to play the system and we're all getting
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:27.440]  screwed but the media loves to talk about bathroom access for transgendered teen kids i mean hey that's
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:32.080]  that's key guys let's not talk about anything else let's not even talk about the illegal immigration
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:38.000]  issues which are being blown up and made insane let's not talk about anything transgendered bathrooms
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.720]  oh my god right so i want to play for you a video about Missouri teenagers protesting a
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.600]  transgendered students use of the girls bathroom and this is what the media focuses on this is the
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:55.680]  facade this is this dmz facade that i was talking about in north korea where the media acts like
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.400]  they can spin the news but guess what the alternative media is winning and we're taking it away from
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:06.560]  transgendered bathrooms and this nonsense of fake racism that they keep pushing on us to make us
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.960]  hate each other let's play this Missouri teenagers protest transgender students use of girls bathroom
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.600]  right now i love that i had so many people out there that went counteract the people who walked
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.200]  out around 200 walked out of class for nearly two hours at pillsborough high school 30 to 40
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.400]  showing their support for senior lila perry to use the girls locker room during jim there is a lot
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.720]  of ignorance i don't and they are claiming that they're uncomfortable i don't believe for a second
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.880]  they are i think this is pure and simple bigotry lila perry was born a boy but says she identified
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.320]  as a woman since age 13 down the street from the school two men who claimed they had relatives at
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.960]  the high school held signs boys need to have their own locker room girls need to have their own locker
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:56.000]  room if somebody has mixed feelings where they are they need to have their own also lilas says
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.080]  school officials have been very accommodating understanding and compliant with title nine
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:04.960]  federal law to solve the controversy they offered her a private gender neutral restroom
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.760]  she turned it down i wasn't hurting anyone and i didn't want to feel segregated out i
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:15.840]  didn't want to be in the gender neutral bathroom i wanted to be i am a girl i shouldn't have to be
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.920]  pushed away and just off to another bathroom how dare that one guy by the way reference basic
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:27.760]  biology and say that he was born a boy look i love everyone i don't care i believe alex
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.760]  doesn't care either who cares anyone could be transgender that's not the issue that is not
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:36.080]  the matter but forcing it and make you the number one topic in the media and saying we all should
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:41.440]  just let transgender people walk all over us everyone has the same rights next up alex jones

[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:28.160]  energy just an overall feeling of well-being i am on my soapbox shouting its praises to everyone
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.520]  i know thank you and great job thank you brock i am on my soapbox shouting its praises too because
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.240]  it's an awesome product anyway now we're going to get into some of this iran news first and foremost
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.760]  i want to play this clip from joe biden on what he has to say how it's understandable it's it's
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.280]  understandable that if we give 150 billion dollars to iran they probably use it for terrorist
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:57.200]  activities that's fine so let's play this video the way i look at it the sanctions relief from
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:05.680]  this deal is a second piece and it goes to the second issue mostly well joe even if even if i
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:13.760]  believe you were able to stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon you're going to give him a whole
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:20.800]  lot of money joe boy and they're going to go out and do more of the bad things they're doing now
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:28.640]  do it more efficiently and threaten our friends in an existential way because they'll have so much
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:37.200]  more money and capacity totally legitimate argument and concern totally legitimate argument and
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.800]  concern that iran might do something bad with 150 billion dollars we're giving them well how about
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:50.080]  this headline from the washington free beacon iran promises to set fire to us interests a senior
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.360]  iranian military official has vowed to quote unquote set fire to all us interests in the region
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:01.520]  and maintained that the islamic republic welcomes war with america according to regional reports
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.840]  demonstrating that tehran is still committed to fighting the united states and then we have a
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:11.040]  nice little one here iran thumbs knows that us even as obama rally support for a new deal
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:16.800]  he from fox news even as president obama was securing the senate support necessary to assure
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:22.240]  passage of the nuclear deal with iran tehran's top defense officials were scoffing at us claims
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.560]  the pact will restrict the islamic republic's military ambitions that's right well hey we'll
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:33.520]  sign a deal with you then we'll just destroy you we'll just completely wipe out all your assets
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:40.240]  and guess what also they're going to do this is from pj media they're also going to apparently
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:46.160]  overthrow israel this is from the iran commander quote we're getting prepared to overthrow israel
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.320]  as the white house secured their last needed vote to block a veto override in the senate on the
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:57.680]  nuclear deal iran unleashed a double pronged attack vowed to block inspector access to some sites
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:04.480]  and vowing to continue preparations to destroy israel iranian defense minister brigadier general
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:10.240]  hussein de khan said today that the international atomic energy agency which linked confidential
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:15.200]  deals that iran that congress has not been able to see would not be able to see all the facilities
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:21.280]  that it wants to and he says iran does not plan to issue permission for the iea to inspect every
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.680]  site so that's fine we'll make a deal with them we'll give them 150 billion dollars joe biden says
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.320]  they'll probably use it for bad and hey they can't see their media nuclear sites or anything
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.680]  hey we're coming back and in this next segment we are premiering the powerful message from alex

[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:15.520]  are boarding trains for germany where the government has pledged billions of dollars in euros to

[01:33:48.000 --> 01:34:00.240]  message welcome back to the alex jones so sorry about that alex has a message that we're going
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:06.160]  to premiere right now to lewis ferrican it's really a balanced take on the whole issue because
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:12.400]  ferrican says a lot of good stuff too and alex is actually going to call in after this video
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:17.440]  premieres live on air exclusive video right now and break down some key points if you got to
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:23.440]  mention as well now i really think this video is a fair take on it because like i just said ferrican
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.080]  said some good things but there's also some headlines like this one quote stalk and kill them
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:34.560]  ferrican says calling for 10 000 volunteers to reportedly kill whites and from this article it
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:39.600]  says this is a quote from ferrican from the conservative post retaliation is a prescription
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.880]  from god to calm the breasts of those children who have been slain so if the federal government
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:50.800]  will not intercede in our affairs then we must rise up and kill those who kill us stalk them
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:57.040]  and kill them and let the pain feel the pain of death that we are feeling also ties into this
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:02.880]  article we covered earlier man faces charges after tweeting kill all white people in town
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.680]  and he's basically said tonight we purge kill all the white people in the town of laplada so this
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.520]  is what's happening after these comments let's go to alex's video and see what's going on
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:22.160]  and i saw a mr alex jones on television recently with pierce morgan of cnn
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:41.920]  and he said before we allow you to take our guns from us 1776 will play out again alex jones
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:49.360]  here with a message to lewis ferrican and the followers of the nation of islam i've been on
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:56.560]  air for 20 years and i have followed your work intently and i'll be honest with you i admire a
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:02.640]  lot of the aspects of what your movement promotes and the courage that you've had and what you've
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:09.120]  done but you are somewhat of an enigma there's the reports about the connection to the nation of
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:14.160]  islam and what happened to mount comex i don't believe the establishment but i also don't believe
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:20.720]  other groups i don't know what the truth is there there's also some of the aggressive militaristic
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.640]  rhetoric and i have concerns about that i'm going to speak to that here in just a moment
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:31.760]  but at the end of the day what i do admire is someone standing up and saying we should
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:37.120]  spend money in our own community we should build ourselves up we shouldn't use the drugs that the
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:44.480]  establishment ships in for social engineering we should be strong men and take care of our
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:50.160]  wives and children we should reject this whole gangster culture the fact the nation of islam
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:57.520]  has fought against the cia's weaponization of hip hop and the whole cop killing culture that's
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.400]  something that's been amazing before i knew about vaccines being deadly and then seeing the facts in
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:09.520]  the documents the nation of islam newspaper was reporting on it 30 years ago and having scientists
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:17.680]  and people on and exposing the nation of islam is exposed the fact that hiv is a weaponized
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:23.120]  race specific bio weapon and it is a fact that africans contracted at a much higher rate than
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.200]  northern europeans very hard northern europeans that's in the medical literature to get it i've
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.520]  talked to scientists to admit it i remember hearing this from doctors back in the 90s sitting around
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:38.080]  talking to my dad who's a retired physician that's the real big agenda and when lucifer con talks
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:44.480]  about the depopulation agenda uh the minimum sentencing agenda all of this stuff is absolutely
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:51.360]  true and i can say i support that um lucifer con can believe what he wants to believe when he gets
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:59.360]  into mother wheels and elijah mohammed up in space and all this stuff uh it's it's to me even if
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:03.520]  that was true and you believe it it's discrediting i think to mix it in with all these other true
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.240]  things that are happening if i wanted to discredit the important message you're putting out i would
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.760]  mix that in i notice i've not been hearing that rhetoric for about 10 15 years so maybe you figured
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.960]  that out and i'm not here lecturing you're probably smarter than i am okay you're a very talented
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:25.200]  orator uh speaker everything uh so i'm not here telling you stuff you don't obviously know
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.720]  know that said the speech you gave a month ago and i think we've seen what's happened since then
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:38.400]  um is very thinly veiled you know if they kill us we go out and we we kill them it would basically
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:51.680]  creep up on them the quran teaches persecution is worse than slaughter then it says retaliation
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:39:03.840]  is prescribed in matters of the slain retaliation is a prescription from god
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:11.680]  to calm the breath of those whose children have been slain
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:22.880]  me so if the federal government will not intercede in our affairs
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:36.880]  then we must rise up and kill those who kill us stop them and kill them and let them feel
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:48.240]  the pain of death that we are and then now we've seen the different radio shows and the new black
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:55.120]  panther party call for the same thing uh but more specifically time to start killing cops time to
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:59.840]  start killing white people maybe kill all cops you know black cops uh this is the type of rhetoric
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:06.800]  pigs in a blanket put wings on pigs from like bacon king noble black supremacy and i want to talk about
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:13.120]  the shooting of the white deputy sheriff in houston texas reminds me of a bar marley song i shot the
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:19.200]  sheriff to me what the houston texas brutal execution before the public represents to me
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:25.440]  it is open season on killing white and white police officers and probably killing cops period it's
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:32.560]  open season towards the police department and the police so now you got some black militant or some
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:41.280]  angry black man walks up and executes a crack a cop in broad daylight this is real it's open
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:47.040]  season on killing white people and cops it's unavoidable inescapable it's funny that now we'll
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.640]  move into a time where the predator will become the prey yes they said there will be a race war
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:57.600]  and that we cannot win a race war we can't win we're outnumbered they got weapons they got drones
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.880]  they got this they got that but i remind you of the buffaloes who outnumbered the lion they're bigger
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:09.360]  than lions and they move in larger herd but they're picked off by lions one by one by one
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.480]  picking them off today we live in a time where the white man will be picked off and it's nothing he
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.760]  can do about it his day is up his time is up we will witness more executions and killing of white
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:26.400]  people and cops than we ever had before we see what the houston texas shooting and we see with the
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:34.960]  news reporting shooting in virginia it's about to go down it's open season on killing white people
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:42.080]  and crack us the black lives matter movement wasn't enough we tried to appeal to them to let them
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:45.840]  know that this type of thing would come it would happen they thought they were indestructible and
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.760]  invincible because they took advantage of the weakness of black people for too long with all
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:58.000]  this police brutality and now they've got black men out there that just can't take it any more
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:03.680]  and they willing to act out and they willing to get you when you least expect it come at you when
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:09.360]  you're not thinking about it it's not safe no more to be white in america but lurking behind any corner
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:27.680]  could be a angry black man ready to take your ass out the globalists the same ones that are putting
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:32.320]  cancer viruses in the vaccines the same ones that are putting fluoride in all our water targeting
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:39.520]  everybody they are pushing through george soros this whole black lives matter movement i mean
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.160]  ferrican if you came out and said what really matters is they're aborting 52% or 51% of black
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.320]  people and here's margaret sanger which i know you've talked about decades ago if you did that
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:53.760]  now in context and said the globalists are funding this obama is funding this to get us all fighting
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:58.160]  with each other right as the financial collapse happens i'd say man was ferrican's a great guy
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:03.360]  instead you play along with the very rhetoric being put out by the white house the ford foundation
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:10.160]  george soros all the usual suspects and that's where i really really really have a big concern
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:16.880]  is that it just fits into that whole narrative and i don't want to see you being played by that
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:21.920]  also your supporters calling in mad saying that i implied you're calling for violence
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:27.200]  can't have it both ways because there is a big call for violence and it's not going to get the
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.240]  respect to the police it's not going to get them to stop it's going to encourage more of an us against
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:38.240]  them mentality i know there's bad departments i know black people get discriminated against i know
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:43.440]  there's things like driving wall black in many areas there's also things like being white in a
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:47.840]  downtown area and being attacked because you're white i mean i hear black people so sad for
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:52.640]  themselves and crying all day and so full of anger because the media always rubs the salt in about
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.280]  how you've been treated i mean i grew up in dallas texas for heaven's sakes no i wouldn't exaggerate
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.640]  probably been 75 fights with black people never started one up and i never was talking with my
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.800]  parents to wine instead i was racially attacked even though it was i'm going to kill your cracker
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:15.120]  ass for getting off at the bus stop at the wrong place and then being 14 having to fight some 18
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.320]  year old man but i want to say something to the racist blacks that attacked me you helped make me
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:28.320]  who i am i'm one mean son of a bitch now because of it but i'm not low enough to sit there and hate
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.880]  black people in general because i was racially attacked over and over again by black gangs you
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:38.000]  know what i was attacked by redneck gangs probably only 20 something times and i was attacked by
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.040]  hispanic gangs when i've been in the hospital had my leg i have a pen in my leg because of it i've
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:47.920]  had concussions my eyes probably don't point the right direction i've been beat so hard but i fought
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:53.040]  right back believe me and so that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger so i forgive the
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:57.360]  racist black people and i want to try to save the blacks that are being aborted just like i want to
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:03.280]  save the whites and hispanics and just like with garter still forcibly inoculating all the mexican
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:07.920]  girls and the convulsions they're having and the deaths that are happening we're all under attack
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.960]  they play us off against each other at one level the racism's real on both sides on all sides but
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:19.120]  above it is a scientific plan that you know about so you get all excited when i talk about 1776
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:23.760]  commencing again if you try to take our guns and you get all excited that makes me think you probably
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.640]  really believe what you're doing you probably are somebody who is a good guy in their heart who's
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:34.080]  tired of being pushed around and i could admire not wanting to be pushed around and i can admire
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.360]  people that are sick of being stepped on but black people are strong black people are smart black
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.080]  people are emotional just like everybody else but it's those emotions that are getting manipulated
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:49.840]  and i don't want to see black people played like a fiddle you yourself are a musician and you know
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:53.920]  that we're all getting played here and i'm sick of it here's the fact that he's now meeting
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:59.600]  reason i shot this video uh with m&m saying he should encourage people to have a good message
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.720]  in hip-hop and and and how they can fight back against the establishment well that's great but
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:10.240]  is it really the best message to tell people if they make us die we make them die even if you
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:15.520]  figuratively understand what you're saying an eye for an eye it's going to be used now by
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:20.000]  operatives and others who are going to stir people up and then meanwhile when somebody puts it out
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:27.280]  kill white people they end up getting put in prison they get their lives ruined and then nobody's
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.320]  there to save them okay i mean look at this guy look at this black guy was calling people to be
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:38.560]  killed i wonder if he said white people attack him 75 times maybe he said cops maybe attacking 10
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:46.320]  times i don't know but i mean i grew up in dallas texas in just the most insane situation where
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:51.200]  everybody got in fights and where the minorities were the majority and they were constantly attacking
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.120]  white people and they had a chance so i'm just you know what i don't have a chip on my shoulder
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:00.160]  you know what i want you to live i want you to thrive but i want you to be honest and i want
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:05.360]  you to understand that slavery racism tribalism has always gone on and i want to invite lucifer
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.120]  con on the show after he talked about us a few times years ago we invited him on they said the
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:14.640]  minister is aware of the show he'll keep in consideration okay whatever i would like lucifer
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:21.200]  con to come on to do a polite interview i had david duke on it was polite but then he said he
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.320]  was being censored and all the rest of us not getting enough time when he got more time than i
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:30.320]  did i agreed a lot more with lucifer con i do with david duke and i'd like to have lucifer con
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.640]  on the broadcast or one of his representatives um or even have a debate with lucifer con i know
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.440]  that ferrican puts himself up there and is very controlled how he does things whatever the point
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:46.560]  is is that i want a real dialogue i want to go out for real racism i want to bring humanity together
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.440]  i know it's great to have racial politics and people like it ferrican and i don't begrudge
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:56.400]  you doing that people under attacks take together it's just be honest you know what you're doing
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:01.360]  and i'm trying to figure out exactly what your end game is alex jones signing off for info wars
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:09.520]  dot com back to the live transmission with anything you see already and i saw a mr alex jones on
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:24.800]  television recently with pierce morgan of cnn and he said before we allow you to take our guns from
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:40.640]  us 1776 will play out again we intend to return america not to a democracy you're lying to the
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:49.440]  american people you're robbing them of democracy this is not a democracy this is an oligarchy
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:59.840]  that is leading america into fascism yes you are stripping the american people of their rights
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:08.800]  in the name of fighting terror you are the terrorist and there's alex's powerful message
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:14.560]  to louis ferrican and some louis ferrican quotes as well and actually alex is so fired up about this
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.800]  he called in and he's going to give a live take right now via phone line on this message alex you
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:26.000]  there thank you anthony i was just listening to it and realized when i shot that at about nine
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.160]  o'clock this morning taking care of a major story we're working on it's a business watching the tv
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:35.760]  network i realized that i didn't add the most important point to wire i wanted to have my message
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:41.200]  to ferrican so now i'm gonna say that message right now and then i guess rob duke and cut it in there
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:47.760]  as an end to the end and it starts right now uh finally uh via phone i just want to add an
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:53.200]  addendum to this message to ferrican this is the point i forgot to make in the video and it's this
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:50:00.560]  i watched his entire 30 minute long speech after muhammed afi was murdered uh four years ago four
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:06.880]  and a half years ago uh outside of triply and tortured to death and and i could see the reason
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:11.600]  ferrican's popular is that he does come across as genuine you could tell he was really upset he
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:16.560]  was friends with qaddafi and i've studied qaddafi people had dark boards of him back in the 80s and
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.200]  loved to hate him turned out that was a false flag he didn't bomb the walkerby scotland plane
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.480]  i'm not saying that he was an angel but compared to al qaeda isis and others uh he was a reformer
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.760]  the last eight years before he was taken out he invested his money in the west gave up his wmd's
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:37.200]  he's worked with the west uh apologized for things they hadn't even done he was giving almost all
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.680]  of libya's money to africa to build africa up i know ferrican had gone there many times and
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:45.680]  was really supporting it so i thought that was something good ferrican was doing and now we
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:51.840]  see the globalist hillary clinton and others go in obama set qaddafi up taking him out and i saw
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:58.720]  him really get upset and basically say that obama was evil and a piece of garbage and a tyrant
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:02.960]  i mean we could pull it up just it's worse than what i said uh the actual quote just pull up
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:08.240]  you know ferrican on qaddafi and obama on the death of qaddafi and so that's the point i'm
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:13.360]  getting at the very people running obama very people that stage the qaddafi takeover and the
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:17.600]  ones that are taken down syria right now and killing all the christians and non-radical muslims and
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:22.800]  others they're the very people trying to push this race for of course there's reasons to be upset
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.880]  of course there's a lot of police brutality and surely racist cops that target black people
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:30.800]  but there's a lot of racist black people target white people it's all part of the stupid war
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:36.160]  they've stirred up to manipulate us so again just remember what happened with qaddafi remember
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:39.840]  what happened to somebody trying to build up africa and trying to help people and actually
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:45.760]  building roads and aquifers everything else that's been destroyed libya is now a failed state
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:50.960]  so that's what this comes down to lewis ferrican should not be involved promoting a project of
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:56.240]  race war but the globalists are pushing i get the right to self-defense but if you said specifically
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:01.760]  go after the people that did x y and z by name that'd be another issue but when you say just in
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:06.000]  general and then a month after you push it it's being parroted everywhere to go out for white
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.880]  people period it's very clear what's going on and you're smart enough i think to understand unless
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:15.440]  you've got brain cancer or something and i don't mean that sarcastically unless you got a brain
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:19.760]  tumor that this is going to start a war that you're not going to get out of and people like me
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.080]  aren't going to get out of and it's going to be bad for humanity period so start talking about
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:28.320]  black abortion start talking about gmo's start talking about vaccines get back to what really
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:33.600]  helps people and not jumping on the bandwagon encouraging your followers who respect you
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:38.880]  and believe in you to go out and be part of this i mean i know george soros is evil and i don't want
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:42.960]  to think you're evil i could sit here and earn brownie points with a conservative audience
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:47.520]  just attacking you all day but i'm actually trying to get something done and reaching out to people
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:53.200]  so we'll see what happens but we need to de-escalate the situation right now it's not because i'm afraid
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.120]  of a whole race war because the white people are going to lose it now i'm afraid we're going to have
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:02.400]  a race war that humanity loses and the globalists win back to anthony gucciardi in the live radio
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:07.920]  transmission well thank you alex for calling in and i think the key point there is that you're not
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:14.160]  just going to attack him for what he said what he apparently intended on saying instead you're
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:20.560]  saying let's all come together as one human race as humanity and instead of further fueling his
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:25.840]  attacks and saying go out and kill people you're saying hey let's not even go against that with
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:30.960]  attacking that guy let's say let's fix this once and for all because ultimately a race war
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:36.000]  is the opposite i believe of what everyone would want you'd have to be as he said mentally insane
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.320]  or have a brain tumor to think that calling for the death of anyone cops whites blacks you name it
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:47.040]  anyone like that in a large group from any type of leader is obviously going to incite violence
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:51.840]  and we've already seen violence we've already seen as we mentioned earlier tweets from people
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:56.800]  saying kill all whites all might whites need to be exterminated let's launch the purge let's
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:02.400]  clean the town out from whites you've heard the youtube clip of that one individual major or
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:06.080]  whatever his name is where he says we need to go out and start stalking killing all the whites
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:10.400]  and everything like that and he calls them crackers which by the way if you were to say the reverse
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:16.240]  negative word about a black person you'd be hung and basically killed but he of course can say oh
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:20.560]  yeah pop a cracker i mean this is totally insane what we're going to do is we're going to open up
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:25.680]  the phone lines and we want to open up the phone lines right now only the callers to get the reaction
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:33.360]  on this on what ferrican is saying what alex is saying the overall attack on humanity from both
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:37.920]  sides of the spectrum get your take on that and we're going to kind of blitz through those calls
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:42.480]  and get everyone's take and develop on that subject a little bit more first i want to cover
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:47.600]  some more news that's breaking right now on info wars dot com these are the featured stories
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:54.640]  breaking headline news on info wars dot com first we have federal judge eager to challenge
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:00.240]  nsa bulk snooping again so hopefully we might actually have some leverage on that a federal
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:04.480]  judge who called nsa surveillance practices almost orwellian says that he found a way to
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.880]  revive a constitutional challenge to the controversial program after a federal court

[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:26.400]  two people and himself thursday in a wooded area of the university of arkansas campus
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.920]  spokesperson z four he said the attack happened at 7 15 p.m and obviously someone went in with
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:38.320]  a machete and started attacking people because machete control is now what we need we need to ban
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:45.280]  machetes new york's town's daily labor law ruled unconstitutional federal drug has judged

[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:59.760]  stack was brought into me so i was just going through that so what i would like to do is i
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:03.360]  would like to go to a couple callers before the break and then we're going to come back
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:09.280]  with more news more videos your take on the ferrican issue and some other subjects as well
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:14.400]  but it looks like we already have chuck from oklahoma who wants to talk about ferrican and the
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:21.040]  race war chuck what's on your mind well you know i wanted to really just kind of see what y'all
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:26.800]  believe that this is deriving from you know it you know seems like a lot of this has started
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:33.760]  towards you know the end you know globally and with obama you know being put into office you
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:38.800]  know i don't know is that a pretense to this you know help starting this race war you know
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:44.880]  it's an interesting question because i think what like black people that are normal and don't want
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.480]  to kill all white people think is you know at some point obama being black and being a president
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:54.560]  is a move forward for the black community you know the first black president and then on the flip
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:59.840]  side there is that radically insane group that thinks great obama's black now we need to get rid
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.480]  of all the white people white people are terrible everyone needs to be black in office so you could
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:10.080]  say obama be you know becoming president fueled this but i've really say that most most people
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:13.760]  most black people white people aren't mentally insane and they understand that it's a great
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:17.600]  leap forward for a black president but that obama is terrible and has nothing to do with his skin
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:23.920]  color right so i would say that it may have contributed does that make sense chuck that
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:27.920]  makes sense sir and this is my last question and i appreciate it very much and you can actually
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:34.160]  take this off air answer the software is uh you know with the uh the uh the border patrol thing

[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:58.640]  on a number of different subjects we have mike in wyoming dug in minnesota steven
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:02.480]  and florida brandon in texas we're going to talk about that but first we have an interesting report
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:09.680]  from john bound called the nazi british crown we'll see what that's about
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:17.280]  their royal highlands indeed the sun published a secret 1933 film showing queen elizabeth being
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:22.720]  taught the nazi salute by her treasonous uncle edward the eighth the prince of wales he would
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:28.640]  later be known as king edward the eighth and emperor of india but would be quietly removed
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:35.200]  from the throne less than 12 months later as he remained pro-nazi even after the war accelerated
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:40.720]  his scandalous marriage to a doubly divorced american woman would be his downfall as the
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:46.720]  history books would have you believe however the once and future king was pigeonholed to the bahamas
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:52.320]  as its governor because his nazi sympathies became widely known during world war two
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:56.720]  two years before his death edward told an interviewer that he never thought hitler was
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:03.680]  such a bad chap an mi5 report featuring a british admiral who had attended hitler's 1937 nuremberg
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:09.280]  rally said that hitler would soon invade but there was no reason to worry about it because he would
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:15.840]  bring the duke of winsor formerly king edward over his king so how far back has the german parasite
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:21.680]  sat on the english throne the lineage is long but begins with the act of settlement of 1701
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:27.360]  when the parliament of england granted the english throne to protestant air sophia of hanover a german
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:34.160]  lineage of king george's soon followed as did the american war for independence in 1840 queen
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:39.680]  victoria married her first cousin prince albert the son of the duke of the sax cobra gotha house
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:45.120]  in germany up until the first world war the sax cobra gotha and another german aristocratic
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:51.680]  name wetten were used those names were replaced with winsor essentially a cover for a hard line
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:56.480]  of german aristocrats occupying the british throne queen elizabeth married prince phillip
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:01.520]  prince phillip is from the german house of gluxberg two of prince phillip's brothers-in-law
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:06.800]  fought for the nazis and many of his relatives were linked with the nazi party in a frank interview
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.400]  he said they found hitler's attempts to restore germany's power and prestige attractive and admitted
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:18.560]  they had inhibitions about the jews from queen elizabeth and prince phillip sprang a man so obsessed
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:23.840]  with his ancestral ties to the bloodthirsty monster vlad the impaler that he has bought up
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:29.840]  so much property in romania he now owns an entire village the genealogy shows that i'm sending from
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:35.280]  vlad the impaler you see so i do have a bit of a stake in the country and prince andrew who was
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:41.680]  accused of child sex charges after now allegedly being part of jeffrey eppstein's case of pedophilia
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:47.360]  and prince edward whose wife sophie was embroiled in a scandal involving sex tours drugs and gay
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:53.280]  prostitution after she was recorded by a reporter posing as a chic and have they stopped oh they've
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:04:00.320]  increased the royal coverage of the royal carriage almost every time i see cien it's the queen of
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:07.040]  england graciously though oh we love you they'll have that british reporter ongoing they're probably
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:12.880]  having pea soup and something proper meal and again i'm not an anglophobe ladies and gentlemen
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:18.720]  i love england love a lot of the culture it's amazing led with the magna carta and the real
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:25.520]  renaissance worldwide so much has come out of the british isles but not the globalist
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:32.000]  and the transylvanian royal family perched like giant stinking vultures on the carcass of the uk
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:39.600]  so when german prince harry donza nazi insignia at a private party and sheepishly apologizes to the
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:46.240]  adoring brainwash public and films are revealed of queen elizabeth giving the heil hitler salute
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:52.880]  real britains though full well they are under occupation john bound for info wars dot com

[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:28.240]  distraught and was seeking help he didn't have a weapon and he wasn't swinging at the officers
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:34.000]  witnesses say a deputy threw hutcheson to the ground and put a knee to his throat he couldn't
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:40.560]  breathe and his face turned pale blue after a few moments he lied motionless as visitors continued
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:46.720]  to pour into the lobby officers are seen attempting to resuscitate him but it was too late joseph

[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:30.400]  discriminated against an illegal alien a bunch of illegal alien workers actually by asking them
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:40.000]  for proof of citizenship they discriminated against the workers who are illegals by asking
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.680]  them for proof of citizenship goes on to say the doj's office of special counsel for immigration
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:51.600]  related unfair employment practices objected to non-us citizens being targeted because of their
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:59.120]  citizen status the illegal aliens are being targeted because they're illegal aliens so now
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:03.920]  they're going to have to pay them money nebraska beef is going to have to pay them money it's hard
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.040]  to run a business these days it's it's it's honestly almost not profitable in most cases
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:16.880]  and i wasn't even going to plug but alex doesn't get outside funding he this is all self-made he
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:21.920]  funds it all himself he doesn't take much profit to be honest with you and he doesn't like to say
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.800]  that on air he really does not he puts all of it pretty much back into this operation i would
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.440]  encourage you personally from my heart to go to info wars store dot com info wars life dot com
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:38.000]  and also good info wars dot com slash money bomb because alex he doesn't promote it enough
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.200]  because he doesn't plug enough because he wants to cover all the news and he wants to talk to you
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:48.560]  guys understandably so but he doesn't plug enough that he's doing a money bomb on in september

[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:28.160]  because of things like that now i want to go to some calls i want to talk to brandon in texas
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:33.520]  because he has a response alex had a message for lewis ferrican which i think was balanced and
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:38.960]  really really good because he said hey ferrican i'm not your enemy i you've said some good things
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:45.040]  but it does seem like you're calling to kill cops and others and inciting your your followers who
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:48.000]  trust you and believe you to go out and kill people which is totally insane it goes back to
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.840]  what i was saying earlier you guys need to go back to kindergarten everyone who's saying kill
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:55.680]  cops and kill white people and learn basic human values brandon what do you have to say about that
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:01.440]  yeah man i agree with you and then you're doing a good job buddy um as far as ferrican goes
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:07.200]  if alex has him on the show and does debate him i really hope he turns up to heat because
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:12.080]  i really felt like he played it safe with david duke and just let him talk more than he should
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:17.840]  have um and i definitely think that ferrican can kind of play the whole semantic game and kind of
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:23.040]  sound like he's kind of on message and he really means well like alex said in his little um his
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:28.640]  little speech but the guy is extremely radical so if he does have him on the show i really
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:32.880]  think alex needs to turn up the heat and i think most of the viewers you know wanted to see him do
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:37.760]  that with david duke and he didn't so that's just what i have to say you're doing a great job and i
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:43.760]  can well thank you i can understand by the way a lot of my black friends have had periods of time
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:48.400]  where they just really did think a lot of things were racist because there is real racism and they
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:52.240]  would think oh that white person is being racist towards me because they've actually been you know
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:59.680]  the subject of racism but myself growing up in philadelphia outside of not just one but two nearby
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:04.320]  murder capitals of the united states camden new jersey and chester pennsylvania i happened to
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:09.520]  know a thing or two about racism in the terms of black people being racist towards whites
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:14.240]  and there's been numerous instances where i've experienced that firsthand as alex said to growing
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:21.120]  up in dalis in a serious physical way but i'm not skewed to this day coming up here saying because
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:28.320]  they beat me up or whatever that i hate black people and luis ferrican also i believe you know
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.520]  you can't just say because of a cop one white cop that did something to a black person that was
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:37.440]  that on armed or whatever that all white people are bad that's just not how this works and it
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:43.520]  goes back to going to kindergarten and getting a kindergarten education on basic human respect
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:51.200]  we've got steven from florida what's your take steven yeah hi uh anthony uh i wanted to say this
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:56.000]  about this issue with ferrican this whole race war they're pushing a couple things first of all
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  or um i don't like ferrican simply for the fact that he just does not come across to me as genuine
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:10.080]  i think he's a showman and he capitalizes on tragic situations for his own personal profit
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:17.840]  he has an agenda and that is just fostering his own you know ego i have nothing against the guy
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:22.960]  because the color of his skin and let me say this i'm a christian i believe in jesus christ
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:29.600]  and my god jesus is colorblind he made all men of all colors and he died for the whole world so
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:33.600]  anybody that wants to claim they're a christian and yet they're trying to push some kind of
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:38.800]  race issue based on skin color ethnicity whatever you're not a true christian you're not a true
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:43.600]  believer in the one true god now that being said i want to make people aware i just talked to a
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:49.600]  friend of mine in texas this morning he lives not too far from houston there's a man in houston
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:56.160]  he's an activist a black man his name's quantel axe he's kind of a junior ferrican but he's not as
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:04.000]  extreme as ferrican and anytime there's any kind of uh you know uh in bad intent toward people of
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:10.080]  color he immediately speaks out and takes up on their behalf he's not making extremist statements
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:14.800]  like you know ferrican obviously like we need to kill them if they're killing us etc but the thing
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:22.480]  i want to say is that this this deputy in houston who was just killed quantel to his uh credit has
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:27.440]  actually rallied the black community there in houston they are having the funeral for this
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:31.840]  man today he's actually out there in support of this man hey so guess what actually apparently
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:37.360]  we had this guy on the show alex had this guy on the alex shown show in 2013 so the producers
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:42.960]  know who you're talking about and i would also say well yeah they better speak out of a against
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:49.200]  killing a cop at a gas station i mean if you're not if you're on the team you're on the team
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:54.240]  that's for shooting random cops at a gas station because they're white uh that's not a winning
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:16:01.200]  team you better be against that i oh wow he's against that uh he better be steve don't you
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:09.120]  think so yes sir yeah because you know again how can you you know distinguish and make statements
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:15.760]  and judgments i mean that's what the word prejudice means you prejudge you don't judge a book by its
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:21.680]  cover like you know martin luther king said you judge it by the character and this is what's not
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:26.880]  brought up in his whole black lives matter thing because again it's fostered by a nappy george
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:32.640]  soros is the white guy who's using these brainwashed black people to further the agenda of the new
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:37.520]  world war that's what they need to wake up that's right steve thank you for your call let's go to
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:45.040]  doug in minnesota who's got another take on this issue hey kudos steve you you hit it on the head
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:51.120]  yeah steve did a great job but the black people gotta understand this is the white guy that hates
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:59.440]  everybody and and he's his agenda is to create problems they need to look at that and and as
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:07.760]  far as alex and barricade i mean they both have good points and alex like he said you got it joined
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:15.920]  together take the take the megabanks and our government as an example hey doug do you think
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:21.760]  for a minute though do you think that most people really buy in to this fake race war don't you
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:26.320]  think most people kind of don't believe in it and they want to come together or do you think this
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:33.520]  is really what's going on smart people don't buy into it but like like alex said there are people
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:41.120]  out there that have been brainwashed or just they look around that they're surrounding to me they
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:46.480]  feel helpless they said what have i got to live for there's nothing out there for us there's no
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:52.960]  job there's nothing right like brice williams the new shooter i mean unfortunately it seems like
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:56.480]  most of these people that are out there killing cops or killing others trying to start a race
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:01.120]  war whatever it is they're just complete losers they have nothing to live for and it all ties into
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:05.760]  your life's purpose really i mean if you're just a loser unfortunately for a lot of these people and
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:10.400]  i say harsh words because i mean they're out here killing people you're just a loser and you have no
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:13.840]  life and you have no passion you don't know what you want to do and you're just jealous of everyone
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:18.720]  and envious and greedy and uh you're gonna want to go out and do bad things that's why all the
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:24.480]  school shooters not only doped up on pharmaceutical drugs that are known to link to aggression and
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:30.400]  things like that but they're always angry enemies of everyone else and if you just find your life's
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:36.320]  passion and decide you want to help people that all goes away so many people say they can't do
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:41.040]  things i can't do this i can't do it i wish i could do it if you just decide for a minute that you
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:46.160]  have a mission in your life all those other things are in your peripheral if those people who decided
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:52.000]  to like the new shooter killing someone because he wanted their job right if he actually sat down
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.600]  and decided to be passionate and help others and do his own reports and become like alternative
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:02.080]  media or something like that he could probably been a star but he decided to kill two people
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:07.040]  instead of doing that and for those who kill cops at gas stations he could have done something with
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:11.600]  his life if he really wanted to push race equality which all he did was the opposite by the way by
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:16.960]  killing a white person for no reason if you really want to push race equality he could start a
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:21.360]  foundation or make youtube videos with a cell phone talking about how we need to come together
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:26.320]  and and love one another that's what this program is about you notice what i've been saying for
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:31.760]  these past two hours is that we need to come together not fueling the black lives clashing
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:37.600]  of police and protesters who just want to further inequality and destroy the human spirit that pushes
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:43.280]  us so i encourage everyone out there to be part of humanity and join the fight for coming together
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.360]  as opposed to fueling all this madness we'll be back on the alex jones show next up we're

[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:23.040]  we're talking about lewis ferrican and what's going on with the call to kill white people
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:28.080]  across the globe and tweet twitter users saying kill all the white people purge them so on and so
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.400]  forth total insanity and how we really need to just come back to the passion of the human spirit
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:37.440]  and come together i'm going to open the phone lines again specifically though i want to hear
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:44.240]  your awakening aha moment story i want to hear what led you to realize there's something wrong
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:51.760]  here with our society our government our system and led you to realize what was really going on
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:57.680]  whether it's with the food supply in the world economy in immigration reform anything i want to
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:04.480]  hear all of your stories i remember years ago what led me to all of this the real the tip
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:10.480]  of the spear for me that plunged into my gut was when i got Lyme disease i was so sick that i went
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:14.640]  to sleep and i took a quote unquote nap for 24 hours and i went to the doctor and he told me
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.320]  the only thing i could do is take steroids so there's nothing else you can do nothing else will
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:23.440]  work you're you're you're really screwed right and i said that's there's no way that's the case
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:27.520]  because these steroids i'm taking are making me feel terrible i mean i was just vomiting i really
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:31.200]  thought i was going to die because we should probably go to the hospital but here's keep
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:36.320]  taking these steroids i went online there was like nothing online at the time and i tried
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:42.160]  to find stuff about natural cures and what could i possibly do and i learned that these pharmaceutical
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:47.200]  drugs i was taking well gee they're loaded with toxic garbage and i learned about things like
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:53.120]  oregano oil and colloidal silver which i started taking let's put that in my protocol and i was
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:56.960]  like well maybe i should buy this organic food and my friends and family were like oh you're
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:01.600]  insane that's just a trend it's just a way to steal your money all that kind of stuff and i told my
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:05.280]  doctor i was going to try it and he told me i was totally crazy says you're you're nuts it's not
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:09.200]  going to do anything you should just you should stop wasting your time just listen to me i've gone
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:13.440]  to harvard i know what i'm talking about you're just some stupid kid that doesn't know what he's
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:18.560]  he's thinking so i tried it and it actually worked you know in like 42 hours i was feeling better
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:24.240]  the natural solutions worked and i went to my doctor and he told me i was insane once again
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:31.920]  i was there's no possible way now he is a listener to the alex joneshow and watches my videos and
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:38.640]  takes products at info wars life dot com you can't make this stuff up right so now it seems
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:42.960]  it's so much more accepted all these things are true it seems so much more accepted that alternative
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:48.720]  medicine is the real deal it seems so much more accepted that the corruption at the deepest levels
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:55.520]  of our government is pouring through the disgusting cracks in this establishment all of this is so real
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:01.200]  and that's why i opened up your calls to hear about your awakening story because for me it was it was
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:06.960]  kind of like waking up from a dream and realizing all this insanity out there it's somewhat overwhelming
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:12.000]  but at the same time it's also fulfilling and a great thing to do a lot of people use the cave
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.800]  analogy by playdough but anyway so we're going to start some calls and listen to your waking up
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:21.440]  experience and we're also going to cover some news we've got stacks and stacks of news here
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:26.400]  from info wars dot com i want to play a video as well there's a lot to get to in this segment
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:30.400]  it's a loaded loaded segment and we're going to come back on the long segment and cover more
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.280]  so first of all let's go to chris in carolina he wants to talk about his awakening story what's
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:44.560]  up chris hey how's it going great tell us your story um it's kind of uh you know when 911 happened i was
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:54.080]  awake and uh i was still in my in my late teens i guess and uh early 20s and uh you know it kind
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.560]  of happened and you know i didn't think much of it at the time i watched loose change and then a while
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:08.880]  went on and um a few years ago i saw jesse ventura's show on uh one of the tv networks i can't
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:14.800]  remember which channel it came on but they were having a marathon that they and uh i sat and watched
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:20.080]  the whole marathon i was like wow and then you know alex was on a few of the shows that's how i found
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:25.120]  alex jones and uh i've been listening to the show ever since that's awesome man you know the coolest
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:31.680]  thing about alex is that he i remember watching him i guess in like 2006 2007 he was on all the
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:36.240]  platforms and he he he doesn't even need to go on the mainstream media but he still does it to bring
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:40.880]  in the mainstream media viewers and i remember watching him on whatever mainstream media program
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:45.680]  it was and you're like wow this guy is actually saying stuff that makes sense and then that's
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:50.080]  what happens is all these mainstream media people think like oh we're doing alex jones a favor by
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:54.560]  covering him they have no actual visitors they have no visitors on their websites and no viewers on
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:29:00.720]  their tv program alex infowars.com is in the billions now of views right so what's happening
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:06.000]  is the mainstream is migrating to the alternative media in massive massive amounts and it's always
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.440]  funny to hear people's stories like oh i was watching cnn and then i saw alex or whatever
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:13.840]  and i just realized it was totally made sense and i stopped watching cnn it's really really funny
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:16.800]  let's go to derrick in wyoming what's your story derrick

[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:08.400]  third party run according to a close associate the glp candidate intends to sign the loyalty pledge
[02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:13.120]  that would bind him to endorse the republican nominee and would preclude him a third party
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:17.760]  run the republican national committee has made it clear that they want every candidate running
[02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:23.440]  for nomination to sign a pledge not to break off and run as a third party candidate under any
[02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:29.040]  circumstances the glp is worried that third party campaigns will jeopardize the party's chances
[02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:34.000]  against the eventual democratic presidential candidate and as he's currently the most popular
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:39.680]  candidate the glp is concerned that donald trump may break off from the pact and he has repeatedly
[02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:44.720]  threatened to do so republican presidential candidate ran paul reminded everyone that it was
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:49.680]  ross perot who ended up giving us the first clinton and if trump breaks off he could give

[02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:42.560]  do so i'm going to get back to calls here in a minute but first i'm going to lead off of this
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:48.880]  headline taxpayers fleeing democrat run states for republican ones americans escaping high taxes
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:55.920]  and welfare states in 2013 more than 200 000 people on net fled states with democrat governors
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:00.880]  for ones with republicans according to an analysis of newly released irs data
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:07.840]  you know what this ties into and i don't believe in the uh false left-right paradigm debate republican
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:14.000]  verse democrat either but it is pretty insane how some of these so-called liberals are getting so
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:20.960]  degenerate and so so out there and bizarre and outlandish that people can't handle it anymore
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:27.200]  let's go to this video clip here in which hillary clinton starts implying she's she's it's called
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  networks ignore hillary's holocaust invoking boxcar blast at gop here's the clip how would you plan
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:40.320]  on dealing with 11 million undocumented immigrants in the u.s well i'm glad you asked me that uh
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:49.360]  because i know that there are some on the other side who um are seriously advocating uh to deport
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:58.800]  11 12 million people who are working here i find at the height of irony that a party which espouses
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:07.680]  small government would want to unleash a massive law enforcement effort including perhaps
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:15.280]  national guard and others to go and literally pull people out of their homes and their workplaces
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:25.280]  round them up put them i don't know in losses boxcars in order to take them across our border i just
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:33.680]  find that not only absurd but appalling i will oppose in every way i can uh what i consider to
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:41.200]  be nothing but a political stunt uh and will also raise questions as i'm doing today about
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:49.200]  what the realities uh of that kind of uh uh claim actually are no secretary look i'm not
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:55.200]  defending the republican party which has its own problems but when hillary clinton says things like
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:00.160]  the gop is insane because they want to get rid of illegal immigrants that's really stepping
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:04.880]  over a line and i think that's why so many people are responding so many people are like this article
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:11.120]  says fleeing democrat run states i mean i used to live in a democrat run state primarily in
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:18.080]  pennsylvania at least philadelphia which is a completely democrat blue area in city in the
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:23.520]  state of pennsylvania and let me tell you the taxes there are insane even just starting a business
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:28.880]  out of your house you have to pay certain city taxes and fines i think the base rate is 250
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:32.560]  dollars even if you want to have like a website domain you're supposed to technically give them
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:38.960]  250 that stops growth that stops industry when you mega tax people especially business owners
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:44.480]  as a business owner i understand this you're all you're doing truthfully is you're making them not
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:49.360]  want to hire more people you're making them not want to help people and even though i'm taxed at
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:53.920]  such a massive rate and i have to pay all these weird bureaucratic system taxes and everything
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:39:00.160]  for my own business with my different companies including natural society is i still give money
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:04.640]  i still donate to feed over 500 000 people every single year through different organizations that
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:08.560]  take the food at the grocery store and give it to those who need it because the grocery store is
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:13.520]  just dump tons of food out but at the same time it makes me it makes me uh it makes me really
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:17.280]  question whether or not i can give every year because of the fact that they're taking all of it
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:23.360]  away in taxes and things like that so anyway moving on i want to also highlight this next video
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:29.760]  in which hillary has the audacity to come after snowden for classified emails right after she
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:34.320]  has her server with classified emails sitting in a bathroom with which is not even locked up or
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:38.000]  anything like that and there's like 30 judges investigating it's totally insane let's watch
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:42.560]  the second video clip
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:50.960]  i believe that he should you know return to this country and rather than taking
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:58.720]  refuge under uh putin who so far as i know has not been transparent about everything russia does
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:03.840]  and i know a lot about what russia does every time i went to russia i believe all of my electronic
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:10.640]  equipment on the plane with the batteries out uh and so he's sought refuge in a country that is
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:16.240]  one of our real competitors for getting information about what the other does or doesn't do he is a
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:24.400]  lawbreaker he violated american law he violated his duties uh that he assumed when he took the job
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:35.360]  that he had and if he is as proud of or as secure in his belief that what he did was the right thing
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:45.920]  he should come home and defend it that's hillary right now laughing as we buy her bogus as she
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:51.040]  insults snowden for leaking information that the nsa is compiling every single thing we do into a
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:57.360]  database and calling us terrorists that is funny this of course because you're not a tv viewer we
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:05.040]  have the hillary pen hillary for president more like hillary for prison pen at infowarstore.com
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:10.240]  alex has messed around with it before you've probably heard it on the show such a beautiful
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:16.800]  laugh really very soothing to the soul now snowden has responded and fired back at hillary
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:22.880]  and there's articles about that now on info wars dot com and this whole weird system is just getting
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:28.960]  a little bit too much for me we also have another video clip i want to fire out it's bobby jindal
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:34.560]  and he says it well he says immigration without assimilation is invasion this is on face the
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:39.920]  nation let's go to that clip real quick we need to insist people that want to come to our country
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:44.800]  should come legally should learn english should adopt our values roll up their sleeves and get to
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:49.200]  work one of the things i've been emphasizing is the son of immigrants who came here legally
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:54.080]  we need to insist on assimilation you know in europe they're not doing that they've got huge problems
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:59.120]  immigration without assimilation is invasion that can weaken our country we don't need to go down
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:04.640]  the path of europe let's insist on being the melting pot let's forget this politically correct
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:09.520]  left notion that we're not a melting pot anymore. political correctness is destroying the united
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:15.120]  states of america completely and destroying its focus and putting it on transgendered issues and
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:20.480]  all these weird race-baiting topics that we've covered over and over again i think it's time to
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:24.640]  shift the focus completely and that's why i want to bring derrick back who is patiently holding
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:29.120]  from wyoming i opened up the phone lines to talk about your awakening experience escaping the
[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:33.520]  mainstream media escaping this system and derrick i apologize for holding you over so long but i
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:39.680]  wanted to ask you your take on all this because it seems so obvious to me i mean with the nebraska
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:44.400]  beef company being fined for asking if they're illegal aliens were illegal aliens in the first
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:51.360]  place is this not just so in your face i can't imagine people can't see this derrick. yeah well
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.920]  you know a lot of them are asleep and being poisoned and you guys cover this very well and
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:00.880]  and you know they're just asleep the public's asleep alex covers it all the time i've been
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:06.480]  a pretty faithful listener for a couple years president planet dot tv member and i was looking
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:12.960]  for a venue that i woke up about five years ago because i got saved and after that i was kind
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:16.960]  of politically awake i shared a little bit of that i kind of wanted quickly's work as a history
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:22.560]  book in 11th grade i almost got kicked out of school and but other than that nutraceuticals
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:27.120]  oil of oregano was also the one i used i was a mechanic for years and poisoned my system by
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:31.200]  washing my hands in the solvent tank and all that welding smoke and all that good stuff so heavy
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:36.800]  metal toxic and then i found you guys those products but yeah people are half asleep you
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:42.400]  know and i uh i push people to the enforce program and that but it's very hard for them so i found
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:47.840]  that different ways to do things i mean we can be activists in our own area uh the hegellian
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:53.280]  dialectic they're really turning up the pressure now and i've talked to older people in their 60s
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:57.280]  um and it's kind of spooky there because they're going to ask for the police state these people
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:01.600]  and you know there there certainly are some people are going to ask for but at the same
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:06.400]  time i do think about 70 percent of the united states i would call it i would call it sleep
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:12.160]  walking in a way that they know what's going on in their bones and they don't appreciate all of
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:15.680]  this race baiting and all this insanity by the mainstream media they want to come together as
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:21.840]  one humanity as one humanity together and come together and say we're done with all of it but
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:25.680]  they don't have the right activation the right passion derek thanks for thank you for your call
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:33.120]  we have rob do standing by in studio a and i want to bring him on the program right now
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:38.000]  via live link and bring him on to ride shotgun while we take some more of these calls and cover
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:43.600]  some more news he's going to be hosting the fourth hour of the show today sort of an info wars overdrive
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:50.240]  that alex is launching four hours every single day for the program rob are you over there in studio a
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:54.560]  yes i am anthony and uh it is great to be here great to be doing the fourth hour
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:45:00.720]  four days this week now and today i really want to put out a message to the globalist and the
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:06.560]  vaccine pusher so i want you started the fourth hour i want you guys to call in with your vaccine
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:12.160]  horror stories any major side effects that you are your children experienced we have to put this
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:16.240]  information out there because this is the season right now the fall season where they want the kids
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:22.240]  to get vaccinated they start pushing the flu shot and last last year i remember covering the stories
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:26.240]  of the little girls who were taking that they were getting vaccinated for the flu shot and then
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:30.400]  dying from the same strain of flu that they were supposedly vaccinated against so the
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:40.080]  the one 800 numbers 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 the start of overdrive we're going to start taking
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:43.760]  your calls i'm going to do it the whole hour i've got some other vaccine news i don't want to cover
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:47.680]  they now want uh pregnant women to take the whooping cough vaccine and i'm going to get
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:54.160]  into all the lies that they tell you to your face okay we have to stop this we have to put out our
[02:45:54.160 --> 02:45:58.960]  own brand of information to shove it in the face of the globalist and the mainstream media who are
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:04.800]  bought and paid for by these giant pharmaceutical companies you know my mind my understanding of
[02:46:04.800 --> 02:46:10.720]  things has evolved a lot over the past few years and i really didn't understand the vaccine issue
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:16.560]  for a long time and i'm not i think i finally understand it when activists say they want
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:22.880]  clean vaccines i think that is the most hard-hitting message because there's so much information out
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:27.280]  there and so much colliding nonsense and craziness about the vaccine movement right and about
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:32.640]  vaccines in general what it really comes down to on the FDA website it admits it but these vaccines
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:38.320]  are loaded with hormones antibiotics different fillers and contaminants and different cells that
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:43.840]  are known from research that it actually could be devastating to your body so my issue with the
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:50.000]  vaccines is what's in them is the loaded additionals that they put on top of the vaccines and i'm
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:54.480]  wondering why they can't make clean vaccines without all these hormones and antibiotics
[02:46:54.480 --> 02:46:59.200]  and gml particulates such as the garter cell vaccine which has genetically modified recombinant
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:05.200]  specimens inside of it so why can they make it without those apparently they do and they make
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:10.720]  it for the globalists and they call them clean vaccines well i want the clean vaccines i don't
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:15.600]  want the vaccines filled with hormones and antibiotics and gml contaminants i totally
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:20.960]  agree anthony and and on top of that they also make them out of aborted baby cells they call
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:26.720]  them diploid cells and that's in a list that's in several vaccines that they want to push on you
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:32.320]  your pregnant wife your kids so if you want to be a party to all this that's your business but
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:35.680]  we're going to put the information out there starting in the fourth hour we're just going to
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:39.760]  go non-stop i want to take as many calls as i can i want you to have your stories ready
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:44.400]  and we're going to put this out as one piece a message to the globalist and vaccine pushers
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:50.000]  because we're not just going to stand by while there's rooms of little girls uh you know yesterday
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.160]  we showed that video and i thought it was from mexico because it was a mexican facebook page
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:59.440]  it was actually little girls in a coastal town of columbia that are writhing on the floor
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:05.360]  after getting this shot this hpv shot and they're all having seizures but they're saying don't worry
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:11.120]  once the seizure passes they're fine we know you really believe that also rob it ties in with this
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:14.800]  kind of these headlines that we see i mean how are we supposed to trust the government with
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:20.640]  this type of operation here's a headline feds want evidence they let mexican drug cartels by guns
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:26.480]  kept quiet quote the defendants should be precluded from mentioning mentioning operation fast and
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:32.000]  furious this is from sputnik on info wars dot com prosecutors in the trial of a murdered us
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:36.560]  border patrol agent are trying to keep details about guns found on the murder scene from the
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:42.480]  jury because of their connection to a scandal ridden federal program between 2006 and 2011
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:48.160]  arizona field office of the united states bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms atf used a tactic known
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:52.480]  as gun walking in a secretive program known as operation fast and furious we all know about
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:57.360]  that during that time period atf purposefully allowed licensed firearms dealers in phoenix and
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:01.440]  tucson to sell weapons to illegal straw buyers with the hope of later tracking them to mexican
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:06.880]  drug cartels oh yeah they wanted to help you right that's not allowed to be talked about please
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:13.200]  don't let them know that we helped mexican drug cartels but then at the same time trust us on
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:20.240]  everything else we do exactly us it's all safe guys sure we do this but don't talk about that
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:25.680]  you know sure the fda approves every single horrible thing in our food supply but vaccines
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:29.840]  don't have anything bad in them and again i've evolved my knowledge on this i think we all have
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:32.720]  understanding that it's about the clean vaccines you're going to cover that in the fourth hour so
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:37.120]  i want to get into some other news sure i'm going to take some calls first here's some more

[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:20.320]  joneshow and i'm sitting in for alex i'm anthony gutiarty and i want to read this headline for
[02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:27.760]  you right now trump evidence suggests obama protecting isis subheadline trump is closer to
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:33.440]  the truth and he realizes according to pentagon this is on info wars dot com right now just
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:38.800]  released the fact that the obama administration is leaving known isis training camps alone
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:42.720]  suggests the white house is protecting the terrorist group according to presidential
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:50.560]  candidate donald trump this is a big statement from donald trump says well you would knock the
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:54.800]  hell out of the training camps that's once a given and it's incredible we don't since we know
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:59.680]  okay this is a michael savage show he says it's almost like we are protecting these people
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:06.880]  so he is obviously saying obama is protecting isis by not targeting their camps this is on
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:11.360]  info wars dot com right now we have another paragraph trump is closer than the truth to the
[02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:16.720]  truth and he realizes a secret u.s. government document obtained by judicial wash reveals
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:21.760]  the u.s. and other nato nations deliberately backed al-qaeda in iraq which morphed into isis
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:26.080]  and other islamic extremist groups overthrow syrian president basheer al-asad well of course
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:32.480]  u.s. backed syrian rebels that chopped off the heads of christians by the dozens in central
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:38.800]  towns they would just round them all up and chop their heads off screaming al-akbar and that's what
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:44.480]  we paid for we would give them rocket launchers and roiders covered in 2011 that obama was
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:48.560]  supporting all of this and supporting syrian rebels going around blowing towns up and killing
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:56.960]  everybody that's the kind of stuff we support here in the united states of america rob i mean
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:01.680]  we talk about this a lot but i mean what do you think about trump he's now saying that
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:06.400]  obama is protecting isis this is some hard-hitting stuff it is and you really got to hand it to him
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:11.520]  um because he's not controlled by a bunch of outside interest he can say things that other
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:17.200]  candidates aren't going to touch i kind of i think the signing the loyalty pledge is a double edged
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:22.720]  sword where they can now really go after trump and and put the hammer down on him and and get him
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:28.560]  out of the race which is what i think the republicans are are planning on doing um by by him using
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:31.840]  that signing that loyalty pledge they're going to say hey now we don't want you in here and you're
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:37.280]  not going to run third party and so now they've got him in in a vice grip essentially unless he
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:42.400]  wins he's out so he can't really influence the election after that but you got to hand it to him
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:46.640]  he is saying some really good things some things that need to be said and it's great that you know
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:51.200]  the mainstream media is unwillingly giving him that platform to put out these ideas that the
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:55.760]  american people already know and already want the the reason he's so popular in the polls is
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:59.280]  because they want to hear stuff like this they want to hear this type of rhetoric they want to
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:04.240]  hear these types of attacks going on with the establishment you know he might just be a genius
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:09.840]  in the way that he positioned himself even if he doesn't win the way he positioned himself with all
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:14.640]  of the early you know scandals and stuff that really no one cared about but the media started
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:19.760]  picking him up and became like a tmz type issue now he can insert real things in there right he
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:25.360]  can insert that obama is protecting isis amid all of this crazy tmz stuff like oh donald trump
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:30.000]  seen and limousine with you know girls or whatever now he can just be like oh by the way obama's
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:34.080]  supporting isis and backs and syrian rebels which behead christians and central squares in the
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:38.720]  middle east and bomb cities and destroy relics we gave them the missile launchers we gave them the
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:44.240]  ak's we gave them the jeeps we gave them all their funding right he can support and push that in
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:50.720]  there in a super genius kind of like media ops level operation where he can start putting in
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:54.960]  truthful information well and the mainstream media knows that oh trump gets rating so we're
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:57.600]  going to talk about trump whatever he says we're going to go with it we're going to go with it
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:03.040]  and they don't even realize that they're putting out our information essentially out to a giant
[02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:07.360]  audience uh well a dwindling audience now but a giant audience if you take all the mainstream
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:11.920]  media outlets out there that are all posting on trump and talking about him and keeping it going so
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:15.680]  i think it's a good thing that this is getting out there whether trump succeeds or fails

[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:39.040]  that i'm going to be talking about and hosting i think that it's time to call on katlyn jenner
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:46.240]  donald trump and other prominent figures to pursue their moral obligation to use their
[03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:52.800]  celebrity to help people in a massive big way i've tweeted at katlyn jenner and i've requested
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:58.400]  that she list her position on a number of key issues on twitter now if you think about it for
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:04.160]  a second if we actually called on these people to address certain issues that were vastly important
[03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:09.120]  like if katlyn jenner were to go on twitter and just say i oppose gmo's do you know what happened
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:14.400]  the next day monsanto would probably be bankrupt i mean honestly cnn tmz everyone would just
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:18.320]  fall over and cover it and go crazy oh my god and everyone tomorrow by tomorrow everyone
[03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:24.080]  know what gmo's are monsanto would be over it'd be done if katlyn jenner did that and i mean that
[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:31.520]  she has a moral obligation now to help people she got the celebrity she has you know had her
[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:36.720]  transgendered transition and now it's her moral obligation i don't care that she's transgendered
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:41.280]  it's her moral obligation to tweet about real things donald trump has a platform now where he
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:46.000]  could change the course of human history he's so big regardless of what you think about him and i'm
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.560]  not saying i support him by the way regardless of what you think about him he has a moral obligation
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:56.560]  and position right now with his celebrity status that he can change the planet if he starts talking
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:01.440]  more about things like this headline on info wars dot com trump evidence suggests obama
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:08.000]  protecting isis just broke live by kit daniels exclusive on info wars where trump says it's
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:14.320]  almost like the us is protecting isis in an interview if trump does more things like this
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:21.120]  we can change the planet because of his stats alex comes here every single day and says what
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:26.000]  people don't want to talk about he does it because of his moral obligation he does it
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:33.840]  because he has to i promise you even if he was using a tin can to voice to the nearby houses
[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:38.240]  or a bullhorn or something he'd be screaming from the rooftops no matter what he just that's
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:44.320]  how he is these people we are calling on them and i want you to tweet at these people and just
[03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:48.960]  hashtag them everywhere on social media call on them to address the real issues ask katlyn Jenner
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:54.640]  to talk about gmail foods ask katlyn Jenner to talk about the reality of anything that you find
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:03:01.200]  crucial ask trump to get more into how about i mean he's talking about legal immigrants and
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:06.480]  stuff like that well and he talks about he hates political correctness he's doing a pretty good
[03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:10.800]  job destroying political correctness but he should get into the real issues how about hillary clinton
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:15.600]  attacking snowden over the classified documents how about hillary clinton's hit squads all the
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:21.840]  insane stuff out there address the real issues and i think if we had that done if celebrities
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:27.680]  actually stood up and did something about it tomorrow we'd have this informational war achieved
[03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:32.720]  and we would drastically help the lives of millions now i'm not sure if rob do is ready

[03:08:41.920 --> 03:08:50.560]  message to the globalists to big pharma to all the vaccine pushers out there if people get this
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:55.600]  video out we're going to put this up by itself this last hour of people with their vaccine
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:59.840]  side effects stories we're going to put it out we're going to let people know this is happening
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:03.600]  when they say they're safe and effective they're lying to you and i'm going to prove it in more
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:06.800]  ways than one also have some articles here that i'm going to go through but let's go ahead and
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:11.760]  let's take our first caller here this is matthew calling from florida matthew what is your story
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:23.360]  hi hi yeah hi i i have a uh four-year-old son who was diagnosed with uh type one diabetes
[03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:32.640]  back in uh august of 2013 and i noticed uh some symptoms right after you had the hepatitis b
[03:09:32.640 --> 03:09:42.400]  vaccine and uh you know i'm i'm still pretty fragile but i live in florida we actually moved
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:53.120]  from san francisco in 2012 and uh you know i'm just at a loss and you know he's in pre-k now and i'm
[03:09:55.120 --> 03:10:01.040]  you know you know so it's a pressure i got a letter that sent home saying that uh you know if
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:06.960]  he wasn't up to date with his immunizations that he's going to get uh not going to be allowed to go
[03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:16.320]  back to school and uh that's the gist of it well one thing they'd never tell you and i'm not sure
[03:10:16.320 --> 03:10:20.560]  what the laws are like in florida is that there are exemption forms they're usually there i think
[03:10:20.560 --> 03:10:24.880]  there's religious exemption in all but two states and i think those are uh mississippi
[03:10:24.880 --> 03:10:30.480]  and west virginia and then you have conscientious objection and a lot of other states there there
[03:10:30.480 --> 03:10:36.560]  are a few that don't allow that but most states do allow a religious exemption in fact uh mother
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:40.960]  just won a legal battle to refuse vaccine for her child made of aborted baby parts and this is out
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:45.600]  of life news um a new york woman has won a legal battle to refuse a vaccine for her child because
[03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:50.320]  it was made from aborted baby parts the vaccine mmr for measles mumps and rubella are required by
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:55.680]  new york city schools for enrollment however the woman was granted the exemption on religious grounds
[03:10:55.680 --> 03:11:02.240]  because she opposes abortion and the vaccine uh used from tissue collected from them so
[03:11:02.240 --> 03:11:06.320]  there's an activist post article that ties in with that aborted fetal cells in products and
[03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:12.400]  vaccines and if you go click go through a few pages of it it lists the vaccines and who makes them
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:18.160]  and mmr too measles mumps and rubella from merc right there the uh chicken pox verifax the chicken
[03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:26.080]  pox uh uh vaccine there the polio vaccine hepatitis a so it's all in there and all these are made
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:31.280]  they're called they call it diploid cells that's their code word for it but they take these aborted
[03:11:31.280 --> 03:11:39.280]  baby cells and that's how they grow this type of media uh medium to make the vaccines so uh thank
[03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:44.480]  you for your story matthew we're going to go to mankind in arizona how are you doing today
[03:11:44.480 --> 03:11:51.120]  doing all right rob can you hear me i can hear you loud and clear go ahead all right cool cool
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:56.960]  yeah first i just wanted to say um you know it's kind of like a aha moment i just want to make two
[03:11:56.960 --> 03:12:03.680]  points and then i'll let you keep rolling with the show but uh the first aha moment um this this whole
[03:12:03.680 --> 03:12:10.960]  situation with the the ferrican you know leading the uh you know million man march again in october
[03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:18.720]  and stuff like that people need to keep an eye on that uh because that mixed with the the information
[03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:25.120]  that trump is now putting out as far as for you know obama being the head and basically being the
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:33.760]  frontrunner for isis which are you know muslim um you know not not saying anything against the
[03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:39.840]  religion but that's everything put together it's it's almost like a no brainer what's about to
[03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:46.080]  happen next so i just kind of want everybody to keep their eyes open on what um you know the
[03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:52.400]  million man march was going to happen in october and um the last thing that i wanted to say was
[03:12:52.400 --> 03:13:00.720]  as far as for with the vaccine um i'm actually i used to it's kind of hard story to tell because
[03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:07.920]  i actually used to be you know i worked for a pediatrician and you know you get into the job
[03:13:07.920 --> 03:13:14.080]  for the right reasons to help these kids and stuff like that and um you know i used to give
[03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:22.880]  shots to the kids thinking that that it would help them you know and because i tell you that
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:27.120]  they're safe and effective they ground that into your head safe and effective safe and effective
[03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:33.200]  don't they right and and after a while i actually started to see the same thing i was because you
[03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:40.000]  know they're just a pediatrician's office you see the same kids coming in and i started noticing
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:46.960]  that whole situation to where it's like their their lights look like they got put out from
[03:13:46.960 --> 03:13:54.400]  taking the vaccines and the mothers would come back in and ask me hey you know um you know ever
[03:13:54.400 --> 03:14:00.240]  since uh they got their shots and you know this not happened or whatever uh sometimes they would
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:04.320]  have seizures or they would say they're just not they haven't really been the same they've
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:11.200]  been violently sick and blah blah blah and they would actually start asking me because they didn't
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:16.720]  really trust even what the doctors were telling them at that point and it was at that point that
[03:14:16.720 --> 03:14:24.880]  i actually took some of the inserts from the vaccines read the whole thing myself and there's
[03:14:24.880 --> 03:14:31.280]  a million words on there but i found that exact same situation where it's like it says right here
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:39.360]  that it's not helping it's not helping you at all it's it's it's almost like a trial and i actually
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:46.480]  ended up having to quit my job because literally morally i couldn't take it anymore it was either
[03:14:46.480 --> 03:14:57.120]  get get paid or continue and continue to hurt kids or you know and i i had to take the alternative
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:02.240]  i had to quit yeah and we played a lot of work we played a portion of an interview um that david
[03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:08.080]  knight did talking with a nurse who admitted that they knew they were giving preemie babies the
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:12.480]  vaccine the regular vaccine schedule and they knew these kids were going to be hurt so they were
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:17.120]  getting the intubators ready so they could help them breathe when they stop breathing these things
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:22.000]  literally kill you and they have to put the intubator in so the kids don't die it's it's crazy
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:26.400]  and you know it takes great courage to step away from that but people need to start speaking out
[03:15:26.400 --> 03:15:30.800]  because if you look at the vaccine schedule from where it was when people like you and i were born
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:37.120]  compared to now it's almost triple quadruple of what they were giving kids back then and you know
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:40.240]  i know plenty of people my age now that have allergies and this and that and that's where all
[03:15:40.240 --> 03:15:45.680]  this stuff comes from when the brain gets attacked it goes into defense mode and defense mode can
[03:15:45.680 --> 03:15:52.160]  come in any forms in fact if you guys can roll the video of of the girls in columbia um writhing
[03:15:52.160 --> 03:15:58.880]  on the floor after their hp v shot i mean this is what happens and the only reason we see it
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:02.560]  here on a mass scales because they're doing this all at school and so all these girls are having
[03:16:02.560 --> 03:16:09.280]  their reaction at the same time in your case it's happening on a case by case basis so parents aren't
[03:16:09.280 --> 03:16:15.040]  seeing the connection and these people i had one of our interns was translating this they don't know
[03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:18.560]  they're like we don't know what's going on we need help we need help and you're the reason they're
[03:16:18.560 --> 03:16:23.200]  not getting help is because the establishment big pharma knows that these are side effects to
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:29.920]  their vaccines and they let it happen so thank you for your call mankind buck what is your vaccine
[03:16:29.920 --> 03:16:38.880]  story well i've got a four-year-old granddaughter and at about a year and a half uh this is before
[03:16:38.880 --> 03:16:44.240]  i knew of any of the dangers of vaccines you know i had no clue until i started listening to dr
[03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:50.320]  jen penny and i kind of just kind of went down a rabbit hole and found this information uh but at
[03:16:50.320 --> 03:16:55.920]  a year and a half uh we our granddaughter came over to our house two days after she'd had her
[03:16:55.920 --> 03:17:03.040]  vaccination and it was like the light had gone out of her eyes she had a blank stare on her face
[03:17:03.040 --> 03:17:07.840]  she wasn't the same i looked at my wife and i said what's the matter with her you know we couldn't
[03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:15.360]  figure it out so i ended up going to the pediatrician uh after i'd done some research with my daughter
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:21.360]  and the pediatrician just lambasted me you know for even being there and even even questioning
[03:17:21.920 --> 03:17:26.800]  how dare you question us we try to ask the question yeah exactly we go to school for this man
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:34.160]  yeah exactly exactly but here's here's another point you know and then that that article about
[03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:41.600]  the uh the mexican they said that one in ten thousand has the gene yeah well if it's one in
[03:17:41.600 --> 03:17:46.880]  ten thousand how many people were in that room that happened to be one where it was way above
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:52.800]  what was it one in ten not one to ten thousand right it's not the gene that's just an excuse they
[03:17:52.800 --> 03:17:57.280]  give you to say you're predisposed to have seizures after you get a vaccine it's okay
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:03.600]  you'll be fine once the seizure passes that's their that's their cover store now my son just had a
[03:18:03.600 --> 03:18:09.440]  baby uh six months ago he's been totally unvaccinated and he is the bride i mean you can just look at
[03:18:09.440 --> 03:18:15.920]  his eyes and just see the sparkle and see that the joy and see that the wonderment that he has
[03:18:15.920 --> 03:18:21.200]  you know everything it's amazing totally different story now thank goodness thank goodness that my
[03:18:21.200 --> 03:18:30.560]  four-year-old granddaughter whose name is harmony um uh and thankfully uh you know she is she is
[03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:38.000]  harmony i mean in a true sense uh thank goodness that she didn't fall susceptible to that russian
[03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:46.800]  roulette of vaccinations because how many people do you know a lot of people do that's sad you know
[03:18:47.360 --> 03:18:52.480]  both of them now are totally off vaccines they're totally healthy and thank god that they didn't
[03:18:53.360 --> 03:18:58.320]  suffer any any truly adverse now who knows you know five years ten years down the road
[03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:05.840]  uh maybe my granddaughter who did have the the vaccine you know i had no idea i saw him i i was
[03:19:05.840 --> 03:19:11.680]  there and i saw him vaccinate my 12 out she wasn't even three hours old when they gave her the
[03:19:11.680 --> 03:19:20.480]  hep B vaccine mm-hmm yeah it just it just it just blows my mind so it was the the three uh a three
[03:19:20.480 --> 03:19:25.360]  hour old baby were they using intravenous drugs were they having anal sex i mean that's why you
[03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:30.160]  get the hep B vaccine if you're leading that kind of lifestyle and you believe that it actually works
[03:19:31.280 --> 03:19:35.680]  you don't get it you don't give it to babies who aren't practicing that but they do that to
[03:19:35.680 --> 03:19:41.200]  cover the nurses who might have hep B it's it's disgusting they're more concerned with how their
[03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:45.920]  outlook appears and and instead of the real the children's health that's not what they're concerned

[03:24:34.080 --> 03:24:39.120]  head over and over again here's an article that came out prominent vaccine denier site
[03:24:39.120 --> 03:24:43.920]  applies trump for saying vaccines can cause autism and i believe the it looks like the
[03:24:44.960 --> 03:24:50.000]  the article came out of natural news and think progress was trying to uh he's already secured
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:54.960]  the racist vote now donald trump is saying that swaying vaccine truthers so you could tell where
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:25:00.480]  their head is lying they want to have they believe in herd immunity that's what their problem is now
[03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:05.200]  last night on the info wars nightly news which airs every night seven p.m central you can find
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:09.920]  it here on info wars dot com you can find it at prisonplanet.tv and then we also put it out on
[03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:18.080]  youtube after it airs live here but uh darin darin mcbreen found a actual gardasil ad that uh it's
[03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:23.280]  about 30 seconds long and you know i'll just this is actually the truth this is what they
[03:25:23.280 --> 03:25:30.000]  should be saying about gardasil so um here's that ad gardasil destroying little girls lives
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:37.040]  one injection at a time and now boys too can get the gardasil shot my steps on 10 months ago
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:42.960]  had the hpv immunization and a week later with blinded left eye yeah they can't wait to give it
[03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:49.280]  to boys may cause convulsions grand mal seizures deafness circulatory collapse blood problems
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:56.480]  leading to unexplained bruising or bleeding fainting or brief loss of consciousness chronic
[03:25:56.480 --> 03:26:04.080]  fatigue syndrome foaming at the mouth blindness and death gardasil there you go and they want to
[03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:09.360]  now mandate that in road island um they actually are trying to put that on and you can only get
[03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:15.280]  out of it without it with a religious exemption and i'm going to play a bit of a video of a parent
[03:26:15.280 --> 03:26:19.040]  confronting the health director in road island i'm going to play that coming up probably in
[03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:27.520]  the next segment but first let's go back to your calls joseph in michigan what is your vaccine story
[03:26:27.520 --> 03:26:34.000]  thanks for having me on i'm i'm kind of getting notified about this last minute um calling about
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:43.520]  vaccine injured children sure yeah my sister lauren 31 years old 1984 she was four months old
[03:26:43.520 --> 03:26:50.480]  she got her first dtp shot about half hour 45 minutes later she went into a 15 minute long
[03:26:50.480 --> 03:27:00.160]  grand mal seizure my sister has cerebral palsy epilepsy and autism from the dtp shot that started
[03:27:00.160 --> 03:27:05.200]  me being a conspiracy theorist 31 years ago i've had a long time to study and do a lot of research
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:12.800]  i i researched the ethyl mercury and how it responds to the membrane on the mitochondrial dna
[03:27:13.440 --> 03:27:19.120]  and how it permeates and saturates and gets inside of that membrane to permeate the cell
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:24.480]  and then switches to a methyl mercury which is like 10 times more toxic and it starts confusing
[03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:30.960]  the caspase three seven and ten which are your biological time clock for your RNA DNA transfer
[03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:36.960]  and it confuses everything about your development and when the aluminum aluminum hydroxide attaches
[03:27:36.960 --> 03:27:43.440]  to the red blood cell and coats it to the point where it cannot transfer atp energy anymore
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:50.560]  and also the same thing with the uh the dna transfer it cripples the child immediately
[03:27:51.200 --> 03:27:58.320]  and then in going going through the research and doing all these links with the uh polysorbate 80
[03:27:58.320 --> 03:28:03.920]  and the msg's and the formaldehyde and what they do to the immuno uh immune immune system
[03:28:05.200 --> 03:28:10.800]  the said that they've been talking bullshit now for these last i'm sorry i'm getting a little
[03:28:11.360 --> 03:28:18.640]  a little elevated we'll bleep that out they've got that they they um they've been denying it
[03:28:18.640 --> 03:28:24.560]  they said back in the 80s oh flip your child over on to their belly because if they're
[03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:28.000]  or onto their back because if they're on their belly they're suffocating you know
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:31.920]  but that was when they started putting the ethyl mercury into the vaccine
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:39.440]  and the children that were dying of sids they knew why then and they know why now sids now is at
[03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:44.720]  its highest rate in history and so is the vaccine schedule what what a coincidence the vaccine
[03:28:44.720 --> 03:28:49.680]  schedules the highest in history sids is highest in history we have the worst infant mortality
[03:28:49.680 --> 03:28:56.880]  in the developed world you know they changed the icd code so that they don't use sids anymore
[03:28:56.880 --> 03:29:03.600]  right they put uh lack of respiratory uh stop breathing uh other they don't say sids anymore so
[03:29:03.600 --> 03:29:08.160]  sids you know supposedly has gone down but it's actually it's worse but when i looked at it
[03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:14.800]  when the ethyl mercury gets in there and it starts confusing the caspase 3 7 and 10 those
[03:29:14.800 --> 03:29:21.440]  trigger a cellular apoptosis that goes after neuronal cells and immune cells and when the
[03:29:21.440 --> 03:29:28.720]  neuronal cells that that are under attack from the apoptosis that is uh this is naturally supposed
[03:29:28.720 --> 03:29:35.360]  to occur a cure on our in our bodies um when they're involuntary motor neurons the respiratory
[03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:40.880]  and cardiovascular systems fail hey joe joe i'm gonna let you finish that up on the other side
[03:29:40.880 --> 03:29:44.960]  of the break we're going to break right now but you sound very educated you need to start making
[03:29:44.960 --> 03:29:50.480]  some youtube videos we'll be back with more of the alex joneshow we're on the march the empires
[03:29:50.480 --> 03:30:02.240]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network a humanitarian crisis of a magnitude not seen
[03:30:02.240 --> 03:30:08.160]  since the second world war is happening right now across the globe syrian refugees streaming into
[03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:13.200]  europe refuse to be put into camps and are boarding trains for germany where the government has
[03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:18.880]  pledged billions of dollars in euros to support them to cover the cost of social benefits language
[03:30:18.880 --> 03:30:25.440]  courses and refugee integration into the labor market germany expects 800 000 refugees this year
[03:30:25.440 --> 03:30:31.520]  up from 200 000 last year more than four million more wait to enter europe from camps in turkey
[03:30:31.520 --> 03:30:36.720]  jordan and lebanon most of the refugees are sunni muslims but yet these wealthy sunni muslim
[03:30:36.720 --> 03:30:42.720]  countries like qatar united arab emirates saudi arabia kawait and brain have refused to take in
[03:30:42.720 --> 03:30:48.960]  refugees the unfolding humanitarian crisis in europe the largest since the second world war
[03:30:48.960 --> 03:30:54.640]  is a direct result of the effort by the united states and the gulf emirates to overthrow the syrian

[03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:03.280]  this is going to be the the next big question for all these presidential candidates how they feel
[03:33:03.280 --> 03:33:08.400]  about mandatory vaccines it's time to get back in their face they're trying to bully us into
[03:33:08.400 --> 03:33:16.000]  medical tyranny i wanted to pick issue with you anti-vaxxers right wingers rednecks it's about big
[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:20.320]  brother uh but on the other hand some things do require some involvement of big brother
[03:33:20.320 --> 03:33:24.720]  what gives you the right to tell me that i should get a shot that my children should be shot i don't
[03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:29.040]  think there's anything extraordinary about resorting to freedom hlory clinton took to twitter to
[03:33:29.040 --> 03:33:34.560]  voice her support for vaccinations the science is clear the earth is round the sky is blue and
[03:33:34.560 --> 03:33:41.280]  vaccines work let's protect all our kids i can't swallow and i spot on my toes and i just want to
[03:33:41.280 --> 03:33:47.600]  tell anybody out there if you get a shot you're a fool meanwhile the insert says it can make you
[03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:54.240]  get measles understand that we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to
[03:33:54.240 --> 03:33:58.320]  their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[03:33:58.320 --> 03:34:03.360]  but i think the parents should have some input the state doesn't own your children parents
[03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:08.000]  own the children and it is an issue of freedom but the 10 can't go to school unless you get
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:13.600]  vaccinated the science of vaccines which work effectively a hundred percent of the time and
[03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:18.880]  the white oh wait a minute i'm sorry you haven't read the cdc memo have you it was 99 percent
[03:34:18.880 --> 03:34:23.200]  last week now they're telling people it's 97 percent so it's not a hundred percent even by
[03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:31.040]  their own statistics meanwhile the outbreak was caused by vaccinated people resistance to tyrants
[03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:39.200]  is obedience to god it's alex jones and what you saw alex jones doing right there getting
[03:34:39.200 --> 03:34:44.480]  loud getting in people's faces that's what we need to do but we also need to be respectful
[03:34:44.480 --> 03:34:48.640]  of that i'm going to show you the right way to do it later on in the show we're going to go back
[03:34:48.640 --> 03:34:53.520]  to your calls here in a second as well um and i'm also going to show you how they're lying to you
[03:34:53.520 --> 03:34:58.400]  about the d-tab vaccine which our caller joseph was just talking about his sister got it and has
[03:34:58.400 --> 03:35:03.840]  cerebral palsy autism there's one other one other condition that she is suffering and i mean
[03:35:04.640 --> 03:35:08.400]  that's and now they want to give it to pregnant women so i'm going to tell you how they lie to
[03:35:08.400 --> 03:35:13.680]  you about that but first one thing to do you can do to protect your health is the use of
[03:35:13.680 --> 03:35:18.640]  colloidal silver that's one thing i use personally on a regular basis i'm starting by i'm getting a
[03:35:18.640 --> 03:35:23.840]  sore throat i feel bad gargle a little bit of colloidal silver and swallow it i like to also
[03:35:23.840 --> 03:35:29.200]  swish it around in my mouth after flossing and brushing uh to me that's and that's my daily
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:33.760]  use of it and i'll take two or three dropper fools swishing around me put a little water in it
[03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:39.280]  and you know it makes my mouth if you if you have really bad breath you should try this just to see
[03:35:39.280 --> 03:35:44.240]  how your mouth feels after you do it you'll be amazed at the bacteria living in your mouth that
[03:35:44.240 --> 03:35:49.200]  is immediately washed away by using silver bullets you can get it at infowarslife.com
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:53.520]  i would recommend having three or four of these in your house at any one time because you never
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:59.200]  know when you're going to need it i also if people are out there um you can make your own colloidal
[03:35:59.200 --> 03:36:06.240]  silver too by getting a colloidal silver generator and that's another way to have a a higher dose
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:12.400]  version you can make it in you know in fact you should do your own research on this and see what
[03:36:12.400 --> 03:36:17.600]  kind of parts per million you agree with this is 30 parts per million i make it at 10 parts per million
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:23.200]  but to each his own because the medical paradigm out there isn't really interested in
[03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:26.960]  helping you they're interested in profits now here i want to go to this daily mail article and
[03:36:26.960 --> 03:36:30.640]  then we're going to get back to joseph pregnant women urged to have whooping cough vaccine after
[03:36:30.640 --> 03:36:35.680]  cases of disease rose 24 in one year so pregnant women are being urged to have whooping cough vaccine
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:40.720]  after figures showed increase in the number of cases experts believe women women are put off
[03:36:40.720 --> 03:36:44.240]  having injections during pregnancy as they fear they might have negative side effects on their
[03:36:44.240 --> 03:36:50.880]  unborn children but uh of course officials are saying we can provide reassurance that the whooping
[03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:55.360]  cough vaccine is safe to use for use during pregnancy with no known adverse side effects for
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:37:00.960]  the mother or baby they say it right there right under uh the picture with the guy with the needle
[03:37:00.960 --> 03:37:05.680]  you can read that where they they say it right there it's it's totally okay we've got but now
[03:37:05.680 --> 03:37:09.920]  let's look at three inserts of three whooping cough vaccines it's also called pertussis for
[03:37:09.920 --> 03:37:14.160]  those of you out there don't know it we're going to look at the infarix this is and this is a insert
[03:37:14.160 --> 03:37:18.560]  that i just went online and found so there's infarix you can see a cellular pertussis that's
[03:37:18.560 --> 03:37:24.400]  one of the vaccines in there it's diphtheria tetanus and pertussis all in one yay uh section eight
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:30.320]  pregnancy so let's go to section eight let's go see what they say in section eight here um
[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:35.600]  in use in specific populations pregnancy animal reproduction studies have not been
[03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:41.680]  conducted with infarix it is also not known whether infarix can cause fetal harm when administered
[03:37:41.680 --> 03:37:45.840]  to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity well they just say it right there
[03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:50.960]  and then pediatric use safety and effectiveness of infarix in infants younger than six weeks of age
[03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:54.960]  and children seven to sixteen years of age have not been established infarix is not approved for
[03:37:54.960 --> 03:38:00.400]  use in these age groups yet they want you to give it to pregnant women and they haven't even tested
[03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:04.800]  it and they admit it in the insert that's why i say hashtag read the damn insert let's look at the
[03:38:04.800 --> 03:38:11.680]  next one this is from uh dap dap to sill this is from um i think this is from pasture the other
[03:38:11.680 --> 03:38:16.800]  one's from glaxosmith kline so they also have a section eight on pregnancy and you could do this
[03:38:16.800 --> 03:38:21.200]  just type in vaccine inserts and you can go pick out which ones you want to look at it's very easy
[03:38:21.200 --> 03:38:26.560]  to do this is a little smaller but same thing pregnancy category c animal reproduction studies
[03:38:26.560 --> 03:38:31.840]  have not been conducted with detap sill vaccine is also not known whether dap to sill vaccine
[03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:36.000]  can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:42.320]  is not approved for infants below six years of age and children seven years of age or older
[03:38:42.320 --> 03:38:47.840]  they just admit it right there all right and here's an actual vaccine insert and this is i
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:53.600]  think this has seven different vaccines and it's called pentasil and once again you open it up
[03:38:54.880 --> 03:38:58.800]  pregnancy animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the pentasil vaccine is not
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:02.800]  known whether pentasil vaccine can cause harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect
[03:39:02.800 --> 03:39:09.200]  reproduction capacity pentasil vaccine is not approved for use of women of childbearing age
[03:39:09.200 --> 03:39:13.280]  so they don't even want women of childbearing age to take this vaccine yet they're pushing it
[03:39:13.280 --> 03:39:18.800]  in this article from daily mail so joseph i want to go back to you what do you think of that
[03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:22.720]  they're still pushing it on pregnant women yet there's studies saying that they've never even
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:28.320]  tested it that's in the insert what do you think of that joseph i've done some extensive research
[03:39:28.320 --> 03:39:37.840]  into toxemia and preeclampsia and preeclampsia is when the fetus now is becoming uh toxic
[03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:43.520]  and the mother and the fetus both know that there is an issue when the blood is toxic
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:49.440]  because the child the fetus's kidneys and liver are not developed right so the mother is responsible
[03:39:49.440 --> 03:39:54.160]  for the cleaning of the blood correct so and when the mother gets vaccinated now the mother's
[03:39:54.160 --> 03:40:00.800]  blood has become toxic the toxic blood goes to the fetus the fetus is under attack now
[03:40:00.800 --> 03:40:06.080]  so the mother knows that there's an issue now with toxic blood going to the fetus so there are
[03:40:06.080 --> 03:40:12.160]  so many preemies because of this because the mother will shed the child in order to save it
[03:40:12.160 --> 03:40:17.920]  from further exposure of toxins from her own blood but the preeclampsia and the toxemia
[03:40:17.920 --> 03:40:25.040]  uh they kill so many children because of the blood is so uh tainted with so many toxins
[03:40:25.040 --> 03:40:31.440]  they're a metallic neurotoxin that there's no way that a brand new baby's kidneys and liver
[03:40:31.440 --> 03:40:35.920]  can start to function right away and then they put the hep B in right right away second day they
[03:40:35.920 --> 03:40:41.040]  want to give them the hep B yeah right right away so they want to add insult injury right on the
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:46.560]  kidneys and liver bang right away and then on top of that when they do a uh early clamping when
[03:40:46.560 --> 03:40:53.280]  they clamp off the umbilical cord too soon imagine this the the the lungs now are full of uh amniotic
[03:40:53.280 --> 03:40:58.640]  fluid right and in the in the when they're in the womb so they're not they're not breathing they have
[03:40:58.640 --> 03:41:04.960]  no oxygen saturation in their lungs so they clamp off the umbilical cord the child's not even developed
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:10.240]  oxygen in the lungs yet so now the brain has started from oxygen because you've just cut off the blood
[03:41:10.240 --> 03:41:16.480]  flow from the mother to the the to the to the fetus the infant's brain and you're spanking the child
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:22.480]  trying to get it to breathe it so it's it takes a little bit before the oxygen will actually
[03:41:22.480 --> 03:41:27.920]  saturate in the lungs and get into the blood so now you've just starved the brain for oxygen that
[03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:33.600]  way also on top of the blood being coated with toxins that don't allow the transfer of oxygen
[03:41:33.600 --> 03:41:42.640]  anyways so free clamping and toxin right now kills so much but and uh i want to get out uh
[03:41:42.640 --> 03:41:49.600]  hopefully before i i lose you that i started this research when my sister first got injured and
[03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:55.920]  people tried to deny me back then and i i hate losing an argument if i don't have enough facts
[03:41:55.920 --> 03:42:00.480]  so that is why i researched all the way to the molecular level right so that when somebody
[03:42:00.480 --> 03:42:05.520]  rebuts back to me something that doesn't make any sense i'll explain it to them molecularly
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:09.520]  well you sound very educated on this joseph and i want to get you as a guest on the nightly news
[03:42:09.520 --> 03:42:14.080]  next week so you can really flesh this out maybe for three or four segments i mean we'll give you
[03:42:14.080 --> 03:42:18.640]  like 30 minutes where you can just lay your research out that you've done as a layperson
[03:42:18.640 --> 03:42:24.320]  because i want people to know that they can also do this type of research and find out this information
[03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:27.520]  and they're not uh they don't have to just listen to the authority figures
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:33.120]  to where they get their health information could i could i tell my show that i actually started
[03:42:33.120 --> 03:42:40.400]  for the case of of uh being an alerted alarmist to try to inform people sure go ahead yeah
[03:42:40.400 --> 03:42:46.400]  where does your show air we started a show our show is uh it's on the net it's on cave radio
[03:42:47.280 --> 03:42:54.640]  broadcasting dot com it's c a v e radio broadcasting dot com the name of our show is freedom works
[03:42:54.640 --> 03:43:00.960]  freedom and then works is w o r x but freedom works on cave radio broadcasting we do it every
[03:43:00.960 --> 03:43:06.400]  sunday from two to five we talk about vaccine injuries and the vaccine protocol and how
[03:43:06.400 --> 03:43:12.800]  allopathic medicine is nothing but legalized eugenics and we explain uh you know all of what
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:17.760]  we we know and then we're also open for input from anybody else that may have a correction
[03:43:17.760 --> 03:43:22.560]  if we're not going the right way true because i'm an electrician by trade right i'm not a doctor
[03:43:22.560 --> 03:43:27.120]  and that's how this is you know we all have to do our own research because it's our
[03:43:27.120 --> 03:43:30.720]  responsibility to look out for our kids it's not the doctor's responsibility it's not the
[03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:34.240]  health care industry's responsibility their responsibility is to make money for their
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:37.920]  shareholders that's what their responsibility is so they don't have any responsibility to the
[03:43:37.920 --> 03:43:43.120]  actual health of our children they may tell you that in ads but as we just played that one ad
[03:43:43.120 --> 03:43:47.200]  that derrick brian voiced that's not what happens they don't really care about the health of your
[03:43:47.200 --> 03:43:51.040]  kid joe we're going to run but we're going to be talking to you very soon z in florida what is your
[03:43:51.040 --> 03:44:02.160]  vaccine story i had i have three grandchildren that was uh um uh given those shots and and uh
[03:44:03.120 --> 03:44:08.640]  before they were given a shot they were kind of like happy and playful and now now they just
[03:44:08.640 --> 03:44:14.480]  kind of like sit around but uh they're they're different ages one is 14 one is uh 10 and the
[03:44:14.480 --> 03:44:23.600]  other one is five and uh so uh but but i'd like to share with you um uh something that might be
[03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:31.520]  helpful to everyone concerned about that because um two or three days maybe before the child gets
[03:44:31.520 --> 03:44:39.840]  ready to take those shots if you would start giving them activated charcoal uh uh activated
[03:44:39.840 --> 03:44:46.000]  charcoal and the minute that thing hit their bodies it will be drawn straight out through the
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:56.960]  charcoal and uh that was something like everyone who uh is afraid uh to stand up to the government
[03:44:56.960 --> 03:45:05.360]  or you know those that uh are uh have this uh law going on which is not a law we know it's not a law
[03:45:05.360 --> 03:45:12.880]  because i read it myself were and i sent it to my son in law but he just chose to ignore it and have
[03:45:12.880 --> 03:45:19.040]  all the children vaccinated so that was not a very good choice for him to make but i just want to
[03:45:19.040 --> 03:45:25.040]  share with uh others if i had known when he was going to take them to to get shots or anything
[03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:32.240]  like that i would have had uh slurry uh charcoal and water have him drink it down several couple
[03:45:32.240 --> 03:45:37.360]  days maybe before and when they when they take that shot it would draw it straight out of their
[03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:42.480]  bodies without appreciate that z appreciate that bit of information that you know it's amazing
[03:45:42.480 --> 03:45:46.880]  activated charcoal baking soda hydrogen peroxide are all things that are very inexpensive to buy
[03:45:46.880 --> 03:45:51.520]  that also have amazing health benefits and i encourage you to do the research on that thank
[03:45:51.520 --> 03:45:56.400]  you very much for that story z i'm sorry that your uh grandkids had to go through the full
[03:45:56.400 --> 03:46:03.120]  vaccination schedule doesn't sound pleasant silvia in california uh what is your vaccine story okay um
[03:46:03.120 --> 03:46:09.040]  back in the sixties as you know the vaccines weren't near as bad as what they have now and uh
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:14.720]  i had to have some vaccines for school plus we were going to go overseas to europe to visit my
[03:46:14.720 --> 03:46:22.720]  mom's relatives and the doctor gave us these shots and the next day i was on standing on this
[03:46:22.720 --> 03:46:28.240]  brick like bench around the tree and i was everything the world was spinning and i passed out
[03:46:28.800 --> 03:46:34.720]  my mother's reaction she ended up in the hospital so we had an asian doctor he tested us and he said
[03:46:34.720 --> 03:46:41.200]  we're allergic to the preservatives used in vaccines and advised us not to have any vaccines
[03:46:41.200 --> 03:46:47.840]  especially flu vaccines for all these years i haven't had to have any vaccines when um
[03:46:47.840 --> 03:46:54.640]  um swine flu came out in 76 we just sweat it we just um got under a bunch of blankets and did
[03:46:54.640 --> 03:47:00.720]  stuff to try and sweat the the virus whatever it was out of us you know and we was only six three
[03:47:00.720 --> 03:47:06.160]  days but now i'm scared because they're passing all these laws in california wanting to force
[03:47:06.160 --> 03:47:09.680]  people to have vaccines and you know there's all kinds of situations what if you have to go to the
[03:47:09.680 --> 03:47:15.760]  hospital what if um what if there's just some situation where you have to be in a place where
[03:47:15.760 --> 03:47:21.600]  there's groups of people and they want to require you to have shots there um what if i a few years
[03:47:21.600 --> 03:47:27.840]  ago i was uh rested on a stake in identity i looked like somebody that robbed a gas station and they
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:31.360]  had me there for two days and then they checked my fingerprints and everything found out it's
[03:47:31.360 --> 03:47:37.200]  the wrong person but they were requiring people to take tb tests and all this stuff and they asked
[03:47:37.200 --> 03:47:42.240]  about a vaccine i said no thank you you know but you have the right to say no what about all these
[03:47:42.240 --> 03:47:46.960]  different situations what are people like us gonna do if we're gonna have to stand up people are
[03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:53.040]  gonna have to stand up and take action in a peaceful lawful way but just stand firm and say no i mean
[03:47:53.040 --> 03:47:58.240]  you you can't let people put stuff in your body it's criminal to let people do that and to force
[03:47:58.240 --> 03:48:03.440]  that on you and i applaud you for that like you've known this for a long time there's a lot of people
[03:48:03.440 --> 03:48:07.280]  out there that don't know a lot of people that don't know that when you get some of these shots you
[03:48:07.280 --> 03:48:13.360]  shed the virus for weeks at a time especially the measles that's why a lot of people were getting
[03:48:13.360 --> 03:48:16.560]  measles and transferring it in this disneyland thing we're already vaccinated because they were
[03:48:16.560 --> 03:48:20.880]  actually shedding the virus getting other people sick so thank you for that silvia now we got james
[03:48:20.880 --> 03:48:28.720]  in california go ahead yeah hi thanks gentlemen for having me on today uh wonderful show great
[03:48:28.720 --> 03:48:37.120]  topic uh my experience was my son uh he's five now um during uh delivering my wife and i obviously
[03:48:37.120 --> 03:48:43.840]  were in the hospital and uh you know this is two three o'clock in the morning uh extremely
[03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:49.200]  tired extremely stressed and when they're ready to you know shoot your kid up with these things
[03:48:49.200 --> 03:48:54.400]  it's just before they even ask you they got these eagles out and they're just ready to stick them
[03:48:54.400 --> 03:49:02.560]  i mean it was uh i mean i still wake up in the middle of the night and um just freaked out thinking
[03:49:02.560 --> 03:49:08.720]  something's going to go wrong um but luckily we haven't experienced any difficulties yet
[03:49:08.720 --> 03:49:16.000]  with our son he's bright he's smart uh no problems um i think part of the thing that we did do that
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:22.960]  was right as soon as my wife became sorry i'm getting a little uh upset about this but um
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:27.600]  um you know i live here in crazy for me where they just want to push this garbage on you now
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:32.240]  we're forced to have our kids shot up with it just when they go to school we have our son
[03:49:32.240 --> 03:49:36.880]  in a private school right now and basically when he's ready to go into the first grade we're going
[03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:41.760]  to be moving out of here uh because we just don't want to deal with it but just the pressure they
[03:49:41.760 --> 03:49:49.280]  put you under um you know during a stressful time like uh pregnancy and living your baby um
[03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:53.920]  and now they just want to shoot you up with this stuff it's it's crazy uh we had an all organic
[03:49:53.920 --> 03:49:59.920]  diet as soon as she became uh pregnant um filtered our water we still have an all organic diet
[03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:08.640]  we don't eat GMO processed foods any of that garbage um he's clear mace and iodine uh

[03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:21.040]  stories for you one's about my sister about eight years ago she got a garter still shot when she was
[03:55:21.040 --> 03:55:28.720]  18 and shortly after that she got chronic fatigue and uh she had that for about a year and they
[03:55:28.720 --> 03:55:36.480]  called it mono and uh she got rid of it for about six months then it came back with like vengeance
[03:55:36.480 --> 03:55:44.080]  and ever since it came back she's had it to this day and uh yeah it's uh very emotional but i found
[03:55:44.080 --> 03:55:50.640]  out about the garter still uh facts and whatnot and uh i talked to my mom and uh she said that she
[03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:56.160]  already had the same conversation with my sister about it and that uh she thought the same thing
[03:55:56.160 --> 03:56:02.560]  but about me a very similar thing happened to me when i was 18 about the same time frame as the
[03:56:02.560 --> 03:56:11.280]  vaccine my senior year and uh about three months after that time i had uh migraine come in december
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:19.760]  20th 2009 i've had that same migraine every day for the past five plus years and uh i've had a stack
[03:56:20.320 --> 03:56:24.720]  like you know that stack of paper you have on that desk that's like my file of the medical
[03:56:24.720 --> 03:56:32.000]  back uh documents like have you seen a botox commercials on tv i've done that uh it's
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:38.160]  sunk into my eye socket then i was blinded for two weeks so i mean i've had a horrible problem since
[03:56:38.160 --> 03:56:44.320]  and uh my family has kind of been cursed because of it they've created a one size fits all situation
[03:56:44.320 --> 03:56:48.880]  for people and are trying to cram everybody into it and it is disgusting um uh john i want to go to
[03:56:48.880 --> 03:56:55.280]  dr mic next and see what he has make sure we get him in dr mic in wyoming can you hear me yes just
[03:56:55.280 --> 03:57:01.680]  fine can you hear me yes go ahead uh yeah to the woman from california who had passed out after
[03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:08.160]  vaccination i would suggest that she uh go back to the the agent doctor who do diagnosed her with
[03:57:08.960 --> 03:57:16.400]  with an immune reaction to that vaccine and see if he would help her make out a medical tag for
[03:57:16.400 --> 03:57:21.440]  medical alert so that if she does you know if she's ever ever in a car accident or whatever
[03:57:22.320 --> 03:57:28.320]  they uh they don't vaccinate her while she's unconscious or unable to uh then for herself
[03:57:28.320 --> 03:57:33.920]  um i'll tell you if i've written op-eds in the local paper and if you want to see
[03:57:35.200 --> 03:57:40.640]  operatives come out of the woodwork pharmaceutical companies must scour the newspapers even in a
[03:57:40.640 --> 03:57:48.320]  small town in southwestern wyoming uh they ferreted out my uh piece and uh wrote an opposing piece
[03:57:48.880 --> 03:57:54.240]  fortunately i i had enough ammunition to to fight back from for dr sherry 10 penny
[03:57:54.240 --> 03:58:00.240]  and her website and others uh that i i i just uh completely shot this guy down and never heard
[03:58:00.240 --> 03:58:07.040]  from him again but uh i i've warned people especially pregnant women away from the hepatitis b
[03:58:07.040 --> 03:58:12.880]  vaccine which they will jab into your your child's thigh before he takes his first breath which makes
[03:58:12.880 --> 03:58:20.960]  absolutely no sense in this country um so i i do try to warn people but uh it's it's it's uh it's
[03:58:20.960 --> 03:58:26.880]  kind of a gray area uh if you look at the the data that people have compiled the uh the number of
[03:58:27.760 --> 03:58:33.200]  autism and uh related cases start to rise uh very quickly there's an inflection point back
