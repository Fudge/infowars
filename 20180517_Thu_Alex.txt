[00:00.000 --> 00:17.700]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[00:17.700 --> 00:33.940]  does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:33.940 --> 00:38.580]  welcome my friends to another global live transmission of the Alex Jones show
[00:38.580 --> 00:45.520]  I'm Alex Jones it is already the 17th day of May 2018 on this Thursday global
[00:45.520 --> 00:49.540]  broadcast and then four hours the War Room with almost Shroyer and of course
[00:49.540 --> 00:52.860]  Roger Stones coming up David Knight was on right before me with the real news
[00:52.860 --> 00:59.500]  doing a great job this only happens every once in a while I looked at a
[00:59.500 --> 01:04.180]  bunch of the news this morning and it made my head start physically spinning
[01:04.180 --> 01:11.100]  you've all heard that term that makes your head spin I remember being like a
[01:11.100 --> 01:14.260]  kid and hearing grandpa just had a heart attack and might die and your head
[01:14.260 --> 01:20.700]  would kind of spin and I'm looking at all this and it's just crazy and the fact
[01:20.700 --> 01:25.540]  that the Republican leadership is so insulated and doesn't even realize
[01:25.540 --> 01:28.940]  what's happening and that's the good Republican leadership not the blue
[01:28.940 --> 01:34.780]  bloods is a big problem we have to go take over public events legally and
[01:34.780 --> 01:38.500]  lawfully like we said Bill Clinton's a rapist we have to take him over and say
[01:38.500 --> 01:43.820]  web censorship is happening now conservative speeches being banned and
[01:43.820 --> 01:49.020]  suppressed now because it's gone from restrictive to choking everywhere we
[01:49.020 --> 01:52.900]  still have a voice because we're on hundreds of radio stations and hundreds
[01:52.900 --> 01:58.660]  of TV stations but Google has totally delisted info wars and everybody else
[01:58.660 --> 02:03.220]  Facebook is blocking engagement just in the last month they already cut it in
[02:03.220 --> 02:10.500]  half and so what was left of that 50% they just restricted that 80% so we had
[02:10.500 --> 02:15.780]  10 million likes on our on our Facebook pages that we built that we promoted
[02:15.780 --> 02:19.580]  that we gave value to Facebook and now they just come in and don't let anybody
[02:19.580 --> 02:25.020]  visit it so a lot of conservatives are just rolling over and saying we suddenly
[02:25.020 --> 02:33.140]  like liberals so that they get promoted but then no one likes them so you take
[02:33.140 --> 02:35.340]  these middle-of-the-road fake conservatives like Ben Shapiro you go to
[02:35.340 --> 02:41.020]  his website almost every comment hates him but he doesn't care because he's
[02:41.020 --> 02:45.100]  not going to be blocked because he's gonna be a Benedict Arnold like Glenn
[02:45.100 --> 02:49.460]  Beck Glenn Beck was told about this plan three and a half years ago that's
[02:49.460 --> 02:54.260]  when he rolled on everybody and became this anti-trump globalist but that
[02:54.260 --> 02:58.900]  destroyed him anyways he'd been in better position sticking to what was right
[02:58.900 --> 03:04.940]  but he sold out and it's it's the same thing but the draconian mega massive
[03:04.940 --> 03:08.380]  censorship is here you've got to physically share news wars.com
[03:08.380 --> 03:13.100]  prisonplanet.com info wars.com you've got to physically share the articles and
[03:13.100 --> 03:18.180]  the videos or they're not going to get out and we're still chugging along but
[03:18.180 --> 03:22.500]  the 2018 elections are here and Trump's got a problem that in fact that's be the
[03:22.500 --> 03:27.620]  name of this whole broadcast today Trump's got a big problem and when we
[03:27.620 --> 03:30.940]  come back I'm gonna get into Trump's big problem and my message to the
[03:30.940 --> 03:37.340]  president because yeah US satisfaction level highest since before the 2016
[03:37.340 --> 03:42.460]  election for Trump leakers to the New York Times confirm FBI ran spy
[03:42.460 --> 03:48.220]  operation against Trump campaign where'd you hear about that first right here
[03:48.580 --> 03:55.820]  that's why they hate us Trump disses himself from White House Saboteur
[03:55.820 --> 04:01.100]  Bolton that's what it is Libya's model plan for North Korea scales back
[04:01.100 --> 04:11.140]  military drill Bolton's in there saying we're gonna do what we did in Libya we're
[04:11.140 --> 04:14.780]  gonna follow that plan which is a total not even code word to North Korea that's
[04:14.780 --> 04:17.580]  what North Korea is worried about as they give up the nukes do what the West says
[04:17.580 --> 04:22.660]  like Gaddafi did he gave up just a WMDs he'll be taken out so why is Bolton in
[04:22.660 --> 04:26.500]  there doing it why did Trump think if he brought in a chief neocon he would
[04:26.500 --> 04:30.140]  actually do what Trump wanted these people have no respect for the country
[04:30.140 --> 04:34.300]  whether they be left wing or right wing these establishment people are a plague
[04:34.300 --> 04:38.660]  speaking of a plague CNN you know has been caught taking billions of dollars
[04:38.660 --> 04:42.140]  over the years from foreign Gulf State dictators and puts their Islamic
[04:42.140 --> 04:45.420]  agenda in America and now they've got a disgusting report out we're gonna cover
[04:45.420 --> 04:51.260]  where they tell everyone how to submit to Ramadan it's disgusting so it's all

[06:22.620 --> 06:30.240]  the heart of the resistance it's Alex Jones well pastor Rodney Howard Brown is
[06:30.240 --> 06:35.220]  gonna be with us in studio for two hours an amazing political mind not just a
[06:35.220 --> 06:40.860]  spiritual brain and he's grew up in South Africa has seen the scourges of
[06:40.860 --> 06:46.020]  socialism and the scourges of globalism you'll be breaking down from his expert
[06:46.020 --> 06:51.640]  perspective where the world is currently he of course first warned in the
[06:51.640 --> 06:55.340]  middle of last year that he'd been told by members of Congress that there was an
[06:55.340 --> 07:01.060]  open plan to try to remove the president extra judicially even outside of
[07:01.060 --> 07:05.980]  something like impeachment and the media said oh that's ridiculous that's not
[07:05.980 --> 07:12.100]  true and a few months later they then went on CNN the former head of the CIA
[07:12.100 --> 07:18.020]  and the former head of the Office of National Intelligence Brennan and of
[07:18.020 --> 07:24.020]  course others and said oh we're gonna remove him by the end of the year but
[07:24.020 --> 07:28.940]  not by impeachment so exactly what pastor Brown said who of course been part
[07:28.940 --> 07:31.860]  of the pair meetings with the president at the White House and more I've been
[07:31.860 --> 07:37.660]  watching him for years when I can catch him on cable and online and so we're
[07:37.660 --> 07:41.460]  gonna discuss the massive censorship the globalism the one-world government the
[07:41.460 --> 07:46.580]  mark of the beast that China has now announced and is rolling out we're
[07:46.580 --> 07:51.060]  going to cover the waterfront with him coming up and the reason Christians are
[07:51.060 --> 07:54.820]  under attack is we don't plug into their one-world government one-world
[07:54.820 --> 07:59.180]  religion stuff that this new pope is pushing and of course the word is now
[07:59.180 --> 08:04.180]  even out of the major Italian papers the pope may resign at any time because
[08:04.180 --> 08:08.340]  his deputy head has been indicted and is in a secret trial in Australia for
[08:08.340 --> 08:15.500]  trafficking over a hundred little boys reportedly talk about a wolf in sheep's
[08:15.500 --> 08:21.860]  clothing we're gonna be looking at all of this coming up today now Trump's got a
[08:21.860 --> 08:26.020]  big problem he's been delivering on what he said he would do he's overall been
[08:26.020 --> 08:30.160]  doing a great job but he's just a man and he's surrounded by the swamp and he's
[08:30.160 --> 08:35.380]  having to governmentally pull from people in the governing class when three
[08:35.380 --> 08:40.220]  or four or five six seven levels deep they are either neocon globalist or
[08:40.220 --> 08:46.340]  leftist globalist and we see example after example of this now where Trump
[08:46.340 --> 08:53.900]  has openly come out against Bolton his new national security advisor because he
[08:53.900 --> 08:58.340]  keeps saying we need to go with the Libya model with North Korea which is the
[08:58.340 --> 09:04.180]  clear signal we're going to overthrow and change your regime show the strategy
[09:04.180 --> 09:07.340]  of tension continues and so North Korea doesn't give up its nooks and then
[09:07.340 --> 09:10.860]  reunify with the South and become industrialized and come out of that
[09:10.860 --> 09:15.900]  nightmare system at least partially in fact here's a clip of a Bolton he's
[09:15.900 --> 09:20.180]  been running around continually parroting this I think we're looking at the
[09:20.180 --> 09:25.940]  Libya model of 2003 2004 we're also looking at what North Korea itself has
[09:25.940 --> 09:30.460]  committed to previously and most importantly I think going back over a
[09:30.460 --> 09:36.740]  quarter of a century to the 1992 joint North South denuclearization agreement
[09:36.740 --> 09:40.340]  where North Korea committed to give up nuclear weapons and committed to give
[09:40.340 --> 09:44.740]  up uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing now we've got other issues
[09:44.740 --> 09:49.900]  to discuss as well their ballistic missile programs their biological and
[09:49.900 --> 09:54.580]  chemical weapons programs their keeping of American hostages the abduction of
[09:54.580 --> 09:58.260]  innocent Japanese and South Korean citizens over the years so there's a
[09:58.260 --> 10:03.820]  lot to talk about and Trump is gonna talk about that but by saying the Libya
[10:03.820 --> 10:08.500]  model days after they say we don't want the Libya model word for word is
[10:08.500 --> 10:15.220]  beyond code word saying oh you can't trust us I elected Trump I did not elect
[10:15.220 --> 10:20.060]  mr. Bolton but we will continue to look at that but but what's the big problem
[10:20.060 --> 10:26.440]  Trump's got he's got people like Bolton but then he's got leakers the New York
[10:26.440 --> 10:31.540]  Times now reports have confirmed that the FBI ran spy operations against the
[10:31.540 --> 10:38.500]  Trump campaign gee the New York Times on the 20th of January 2017 said that as
[10:38.500 --> 10:44.660]  its banner headline we pointed that out even previously so they went oh Trump
[10:44.660 --> 10:50.900]  gets it that he spied on from Alex Jones and I'd love it if I had that much
[10:50.900 --> 10:58.380]  influence but that's not the case they just make that up so again this is
[10:58.380 --> 11:04.380]  beyond Watergate the president's own words but but what's his real problem his
[11:04.380 --> 11:13.780]  real problem is Zuckerberg and Tim Cook at Apple and Bezos at Amazon and the
[11:13.780 --> 11:21.340]  folks over at Alphabet that runs Google their old logo was their old maximals
[11:21.340 --> 11:26.180]  don't be evil how about don't be Google Google has broken their algorithm on
[11:26.180 --> 11:31.420]  purpose it is now a worthless search engine being is like the old Google it
[11:31.420 --> 11:36.060]  actually works even though that's Microsoft and Microsoft isn't good it's
[11:36.060 --> 11:40.860]  that they actually want to take away Google's dominance 93% of global web
[11:40.860 --> 11:48.860]  searches but for all intents and purposes Google is gone Google is dead so
[11:48.860 --> 11:51.500]  even things like start page and things that are great folks and give you web
[11:51.500 --> 11:56.340]  browsing protection interface with Google and other systems and it's it's
[11:56.340 --> 12:02.780]  totally broken when it comes to medical news you name it anti-gun news you name
[12:02.780 --> 12:08.780]  it it force feeds garbage and we have the documents we have the internal
[12:08.780 --> 12:12.460]  documents where their job is to quote silence people like Alex Jones it's
[12:12.460 --> 12:19.940]  outrageous and Trump can still go on Fox News but that is a aging and smaller
[12:19.940 --> 12:25.740]  audience his real power where there were hundreds of viral videos a week with
[12:25.740 --> 12:30.100]  tens of millions of views we had videos with 37 million views 40 million views
[12:30.100 --> 12:35.580]  50 million views that were just deleted after the election no reason given they
[12:35.580 --> 12:41.780]  were all pro-Trump and then they started rationing down down down down down
[12:41.780 --> 12:48.100]  down down down down to nothing to where it's it's it be on our pages even see
[12:48.100 --> 12:51.660]  our material and the president has been warned about this he's made some
[12:51.660 --> 12:56.980]  statements about it but we have serious antitrust issues we have serious
[12:56.980 --> 13:01.420]  racketeering issues we have serious anti-free speech collusion and they're
[13:01.420 --> 13:05.900]  targeting Christians conservatives libertarians nationalists listen in the
[13:05.900 --> 13:12.180]  same week Apple and Google removed on their calendars Easter and other
[13:12.180 --> 13:17.020]  Christian holidays and then on those days did doodles about atheists and
[13:17.020 --> 13:21.500]  communists you know the doodle top of the page and they said no we removed
[13:21.500 --> 13:31.420]  Christian stuff on purpose but then I have CNN promoting Ramadan yesterday
[13:31.420 --> 13:36.380]  coming up I'm gonna break it down with a slideshow about how to behave during
[13:36.380 --> 13:40.020]  Ramadan and how and the etiquette etiquette you should have with the
[13:40.020 --> 13:43.900]  Islamification of everything under Ramadan and of course they're famously
[13:43.900 --> 13:51.140]  been paid billions of dollars by Arab Gulf dictatorship states and of course
[13:51.140 --> 13:57.300]  amber lion was the first award-winning journalist six years ago in 2012 to
[13:57.300 --> 14:01.860]  expose it CNN journalist mainstream media takes money from foreign dictators to
[14:01.860 --> 14:06.100]  run flattering propaganda that's right they are total fake news they take
[14:06.100 --> 14:11.860]  money from George Soros CNN does to say he was not a Nazi collaborator when he
[14:11.860 --> 14:16.900]  100% was and admitted it on 60 minutes and wrote a book about it it is just
[14:16.900 --> 14:22.260]  incredible next-level fake news so Trump's problem is for 2018 and beyond
[14:22.260 --> 14:27.460]  he's having his legs cut out from under him and he has a responsibility to go
[14:27.460 --> 14:30.660]  up against those attacking our free speech he's starting to do some of it
[14:30.660 --> 14:35.460]  saying hey China's manipulating our news it's a big problem China's taking over
[14:35.460 --> 14:38.740]  universities it's a problem hey Hollywood's getting bought by China it's
[14:38.740 --> 14:45.580]  a problem it's beyond that and we need Congress to move on this now they've
[14:45.580 --> 14:49.860]  started to but the Republicans are so ignorant like the Democrats during the
[14:49.860 --> 14:53.780]  diamond and silk herring that they just don't get what's happening now we're
[14:53.780 --> 14:58.740]  gonna go to break and come back with the incredible leakers inside the White

[19:06.020 --> 19:10.500]  an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[19:10.500 --> 19:15.580]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[19:15.580 --> 19:20.900]  respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that
[19:20.900 --> 19:24.780]  people who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and
[19:24.780 --> 19:29.260]  inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published trials
[19:29.260 --> 19:34.300]  and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable
[19:34.300 --> 19:38.500]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is
[19:38.500 --> 19:43.260]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[19:43.260 --> 19:47.300]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which
[19:47.300 --> 19:52.260]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go

[20:08.380 --> 20:28.140]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones by the way
[20:28.140 --> 20:31.980]  I've read the book it's amazing he sent us 500 free ones but I ordered a couple
[20:31.980 --> 20:34.940]  thousand more they're coming in next week it doesn't officially ship out
[20:34.940 --> 20:39.860]  until what the 24th but it's the killing of Uncle Sam the demise of the United
[20:39.860 --> 20:43.620]  States of America you've got to read this this is what the globalists are
[20:43.620 --> 20:48.580]  trying to do this is a true next-level Paul Revere warning and he wrote it with
[20:48.580 --> 20:53.500]  a bunch of former top CIA people who helped advise him on it it really is
[20:53.500 --> 20:57.860]  amazing he's in even more intense in person that's just hanging out with
[20:57.860 --> 21:01.580]  about three minutes during the break so that's coming up with a pastor Rodney
[21:01.580 --> 21:05.420]  Howard Brown and Paul L Williams also co-wrote the book but he'll be with us
[21:05.420 --> 21:09.940]  in studio for two hours and he wanted to come here I was like sure I'm flattered
[21:09.940 --> 21:14.340]  but then he told me why he said that he basically well he'll tell you once he
[21:14.340 --> 21:19.540]  gets on air what what God told him about what info wars is going to do and you
[21:19.540 --> 21:22.420]  know I can feel that I can see that as well but also the great work he does
[21:22.420 --> 21:25.900]  reaching hundreds of millions of people just over international television and
[21:25.900 --> 21:28.780]  traveling all over the world and more and more I realized we're going to put
[21:28.780 --> 21:34.260]  this network up and go basically 24 hours a day around the world but that
[21:34.260 --> 21:38.540]  more and more it's going to be on the ground reporting with correspondence all
[21:38.540 --> 21:42.340]  over the planet that's really my vision and I hadn't really even told him that
[21:42.340 --> 21:45.420]  that it wasn't even for the United States but that I wanted later to turn on
[21:45.420 --> 21:49.180]  satellites all over the world which will cost a lot of money and that's the
[21:49.180 --> 21:53.500]  thing I just did a 30-second plug last segment about some of the products if I
[21:53.500 --> 21:57.020]  don't plug more we won't bring the money in because they banned us off Google
[21:57.020 --> 22:00.940]  ads they're banning us off every platform I don't even want to say the
[22:00.940 --> 22:05.820]  stuff that's behind the scenes because I mean it's I'm not a victim but I know
[22:05.820 --> 22:15.140]  this draconian harassment of major sporting good stores churches it's not
[22:15.140 --> 22:19.620]  just us it's everybody we have a voice so you're getting to hear about it this
[22:19.620 --> 22:24.060]  is really draconian and it's going on despite the fact Trump's in office you
[22:24.060 --> 22:28.340]  know it's come out in the news the IRS is still persecuting Christians and 501
[22:28.340 --> 22:31.780]  see threes and not letting veterans groups and others get their tax
[22:31.780 --> 22:36.300]  exemption people say well Trump better stop it they won't even put his signs
[22:36.300 --> 22:42.060]  up his picture at the VA they have to send congressmen in there's video of
[22:42.060 --> 22:47.060]  this after he's been in office over a year to say put the president's picture
[22:47.060 --> 22:52.460]  up and they put the president's picture up and a day later it's gone and Obama's
[22:52.460 --> 22:57.340]  back up there there is total rebellion in this country by the globalist by the
[22:57.340 --> 23:02.180]  Democrats and the giant hordes of illegal aliens they're bringing in this
[23:02.180 --> 23:05.580]  is the attempted takedown of this country and I'm just here raising the
[23:05.580 --> 23:12.260]  alarm because I want to come on air and be calm about all this but it is
[23:12.260 --> 23:18.500]  incredibly intense what's going on and then I see all these trader conservatives
[23:18.500 --> 23:23.460]  and mainline churches they won't say a word about what's going on out in the
[23:23.460 --> 23:27.140]  real world a lot of these churches think if they just shut up they'll be left
[23:27.140 --> 23:31.460]  alone well now the methods churches are pulling the crosses out in Europe main
[23:31.460 --> 23:35.780]  line churches are pulling the crosses out saying we have Muslim Ramadan in the
[23:35.780 --> 23:40.980]  churches now we're being overrun we're being overtaken we're being captured
[23:40.980 --> 23:47.020]  this is a world war against humanity this is a total culture war a total
[23:47.020 --> 23:54.220]  complete takeover and now I'm ranting let me get back into the news here there's
[23:54.220 --> 23:58.660]  so much I want to get to next segment I'm gonna do the whole Ramadan thing
[23:58.660 --> 24:03.380]  because wait till you see this it's just it's just par for the course but before
[24:03.380 --> 24:09.740]  I go any further let's let's just get into this little piece of news leakers
[24:09.740 --> 24:16.340]  confirm to the New York Times that FBI ran spy operation against Trump campaign
[24:16.340 --> 24:21.140]  well we've known it was Samantha Powers and Barack Obama that ran that we know
[24:21.140 --> 24:24.440]  from the FISA court we know what they filled out they were so arrogant when
[24:24.440 --> 24:28.780]  he was president-elect they said oh we've been spying on him we've got the
[24:28.780 --> 24:32.420]  proof of all the bad things he's done and Trump went really that's illegal to
[24:32.420 --> 24:36.420]  do that and to say you're doing it because that's a leak they went oh we
[24:36.420 --> 24:44.780]  actually never said that in early 2017 and now Comey and Mueller and all of them
[24:44.780 --> 24:50.420]  had testified before Congress and said we were not surveilling the president or
[24:50.420 --> 24:54.980]  anybody in Trump Tower or anybody in his campaign because that'd be campaign
[24:54.980 --> 25:00.140]  meddling of the Democratic Party but they did do it and now it's all coming
[25:00.140 --> 25:06.620]  out and Rosenstein will not give Congress any of the documents for the
[25:06.620 --> 25:10.180]  House oversight committee or the House Intelligence Committee when they're
[25:10.180 --> 25:15.460]  co-equal with the executive but the executive is saying release it the
[25:15.460 --> 25:18.580]  president saying release it to Congress with their intelligence
[25:18.580 --> 25:25.420]  clearings clearances and they're saying no we can't show it and Mueller saying
[25:25.420 --> 25:31.460]  no no no because we know what it is it was in the New York Times in late
[25:31.460 --> 25:38.100]  November and December 2016 we pull the articles up and it said right there well
[25:38.100 --> 25:43.060]  Obama administration is quietly passing out the evidence it found while
[25:43.060 --> 25:47.420]  surveilling the Trump campaign of wrongdoing and collusion so Trump's
[25:47.420 --> 25:50.980]  gonna be brought down don't worry they were saying that so the Democrats in
[25:50.980 --> 25:57.540]  government and people wouldn't follow their new elected president so that so
[25:57.540 --> 26:03.620]  that so that people wouldn't be aware of what was going on that that that that
[26:03.620 --> 26:07.740]  Trump was actually removing their criminal operation they were there saying
[26:07.740 --> 26:12.260]  no no no we're going to win don't worry we've got evidence we surveilled Trump
[26:12.260 --> 26:16.460]  he's a traitor Trump gets in
[26:18.740 --> 26:24.540]  Admiral Rogers from the NSA comes to him and says sir you were illegally
[26:24.540 --> 26:30.900]  spied on at Trump Tower what a week before he was sworn in and Trump now
[26:30.900 --> 26:35.100]  knows everything that happened and so now you see people like the former head
[26:35.100 --> 26:41.700]  of the NSA and CIA Hayden in the news last week saying just hold on hold on
[26:41.700 --> 26:46.620]  if you're in government hold on don't do what Trump says he'll be gone soon that
[26:46.620 --> 26:51.020]  is sedition that is treason that is unbelievable criminal activity that is
[26:51.020 --> 26:55.660]  mutiny within the government against the executive branch that's what you call
[26:55.660 --> 26:58.460]  a soft coup
[26:58.460 --> 27:05.820]  think about that it's just mind-blowing but he said something else he said he
[27:05.820 --> 27:10.060]  said it on television we played the club last week he said but if or was it two
[27:10.060 --> 27:15.780]  weeks ago he said if you haven't been in government a while he's trying to hire
[27:15.780 --> 27:22.700]  you don't work with him or you'll be blackballed once we throw him out now
[27:22.700 --> 27:32.460]  there it is Hayden don't work for Trump administration last week wow takes a lot
[27:32.460 --> 27:38.020]  of nerve doesn't it but that's what they're doing and so they've lied to us
[27:38.020 --> 27:41.420]  at every front and I know you as listeners or you who are politically
[27:41.420 --> 27:45.860]  involved politically aware you remember all this but the general public doesn't
[27:45.860 --> 27:52.340]  and now Mueller is well into his second year of fraud and has been caught lying
[27:52.340 --> 27:57.620]  on every front and still he's there because they have nothing to lose
[27:57.620 --> 28:01.780]  they're not going to give up until they've removed the president and at a
[28:01.780 --> 28:05.460]  certain point he just can't sit back and watch them censor the internet and send
[28:05.460 --> 28:09.660]  the IRS after tens of thousands of churches and bully people and cut off
[28:09.660 --> 28:14.220]  the the aid of the veterans at the VA all of this is purposeful by these
[28:14.220 --> 28:19.700]  arrogant monstrous narcissistic demonically possessed people I mean put
[28:19.700 --> 28:23.860]  that photo back up for TV viewers of Hayden and if you ever watch him speak
[28:23.860 --> 28:28.780]  and just how much he's into himself and how arrogant they are these people have
[28:28.780 --> 28:35.660]  a spirit of just unending arrogance and they're always pathetic and stupid and
[28:35.660 --> 28:41.780]  twisted amazing but Trump has congratulated Mueller on second year of
[28:41.780 --> 28:45.140]  greatest witch hunt American history will read some of those quotes straight
[28:45.140 --> 28:49.500]  ahead and then we'll look at what just happened in the attacks in Israel it
[28:49.500 --> 28:53.940]  turns out almost every one of the dead protesters shot by the Israelis was

[34:11.820 --> 34:17.140]  journalists from CNN who exposed that many many years ago you can see the
[34:17.140 --> 34:21.540]  reports for yourself like Amber Lyon CNN journalist mainstream media takes money
[34:21.540 --> 34:28.980]  from foreign dictators to run flattering propaganda now we'll get to more of
[34:28.980 --> 34:33.300]  this in a moment but look at this story out of town hall Hamas wins media
[34:33.300 --> 34:39.540]  support all 50 dead terrorist martyrs but admits that they were Hamas members
[34:39.540 --> 34:44.580]  who were attacking and trying to come over the Israeli border some of which
[34:44.580 --> 34:50.580]  had suicide vest and who even brought their children so 50 of the 62 were
[34:50.580 --> 34:55.100]  full-grown men Hamas members who then brought their little children to the
[34:55.100 --> 35:03.980]  riot but then CNN helps basically spend all that so with that background last
[35:03.980 --> 35:10.900]  night I go check out enemy propaganda CNN and I see learn how to behave as the
[35:10.900 --> 35:22.660]  headline during Ramadan and then it goes through the ten helpful tips of how
[35:22.660 --> 35:28.140]  you should behave during Ramadan there's several articles we've got here on
[35:28.140 --> 35:43.100]  screen the slideshow that it goes through now looking at the slideshow it
[35:43.100 --> 35:49.260]  goes through and explains oh there's 1.8 billion Muslims I kept saying 1.5 I'm
[35:49.260 --> 35:56.740]  sorry it's now more than that and it set to be 3.3 billion soon they say and they
[35:56.740 --> 36:02.140]  go on to say you can totally eat in front of us but try not to schedule a
[36:02.140 --> 36:08.380]  work lunch don't don't do that that's mean it goes on to say you don't have to
[36:08.380 --> 36:14.300]  fast with us but it'd be nice if you do but you can also join us at night during
[36:14.300 --> 36:22.380]  our feast five you don't have to know when it begins but please be a little
[36:22.380 --> 36:30.900]  flexible to us and it shows all these glowing happy pictures of Muslim women
[36:30.900 --> 36:34.940]  not wearing full burqas not being blown up in suicide bombs not being sold into
[36:34.940 --> 36:41.140]  sex slavery in North Africa not the classic giant Ramadan bombings that
[36:41.140 --> 36:48.580]  always massively intensify it's a big disgusting sickening deceptive PRPs
[36:48.580 --> 36:55.420]  probably paid for by the Islamist but I've got another set of articles here
[36:55.420 --> 37:03.580]  about other Ramadan propaganda that has been paid for for US news this year and
[37:03.580 --> 37:09.780]  it goes on from there we'll still go out for coffee with you but won't drink any
[37:09.780 --> 37:21.980]  but we may keep our distance can you say Ramadan Mubarak it goes on to say
[37:21.980 --> 37:25.660]  there's no war on Christmas level controversy surrounding the greeting
[37:25.660 --> 37:30.220]  well because it's Islamic you're allowed to say it so they said so it's okay to
[37:30.220 --> 37:38.900]  say happy Ramadan isn't that nice they say there's not a war on Christmas
[37:38.900 --> 37:42.620]  controversy because you don't say Merry Christmas so they're admitting there's a
[37:42.620 --> 37:46.700]  war on Christmas they're saying but you're allowed to say this don't you
[37:46.700 --> 37:52.020]  love how CNN tells you how you're allowed to speak what you're allowed to do
[37:52.020 --> 37:56.740]  how you're supposed to think and they talk to you like you're a three-year-old
[37:56.740 --> 38:03.060]  and then tell you with all these glowing pictures and glowing text how great
[38:03.060 --> 38:11.400]  Ramadan is but please don't say I should fast to I need to lose weight and of
[38:11.400 --> 38:14.340]  course this is nothing compared to the usual propaganda it gets far worse than
[38:14.340 --> 38:19.700]  this in Germany we've shown it they run national TV ads with their hip-hop and
[38:19.700 --> 38:23.540]  rock stars saying I wear the hijab I've joined Islam paid for by the
[38:23.540 --> 38:28.220]  government they have children's daytime television after school programs where
[38:28.220 --> 38:33.260]  14-year-old girls married 25-year-old men who are Muslim and it's a good thing
[38:33.260 --> 38:39.380]  even though it's illegal under German law the Finnish court last week ruled
[38:39.380 --> 38:43.580]  that a 25-year-old man could have sex with a 10-year-old girl because it's
[38:43.580 --> 38:48.300]  his religion and and and Mohammed had sex with nine-year-olds so the Muslims
[38:48.300 --> 38:52.740]  get to follow one set of rules Sharia and the governments are bifurcating it
[38:52.740 --> 38:56.820]  now to actually follow it I used to hear people warn about this 20 years ago I
[38:56.820 --> 39:01.540]  thought they were crazy but I wasn't thinking about parliamentary systems in
[39:01.540 --> 39:05.660]  Europe on average they've got more than 10 parties per country the biggest party
[39:05.660 --> 39:09.300]  usually is 20 30% of the vote if you've got Muslims that are 10 20% of the
[39:09.300 --> 39:18.300]  population it's checkmate because they vote as a block it's game over game
[39:18.300 --> 39:24.500]  over and that's why we're in so much trouble we are being conquered and all
[39:24.500 --> 39:32.940]  the media CNN Apple Google they take Christianity off their calendars they
[39:32.940 --> 39:42.100]  put down Christianity they tell you don't say Merry Christmas but when it
[39:42.100 --> 39:47.580]  comes to Muslims they force feed it and so that's what this is all about because
[39:47.580 --> 39:52.300]  the globalist in the demographics Europe is having 1.3 children on average the
[39:52.300 --> 39:56.100]  average Muslim has six children and the decision has been made to not get them
[39:56.100 --> 40:01.500]  to get in the melting pot with us and then give up their really radical out of
[40:01.500 --> 40:04.900]  control system where every Muslim country is in turmoil they're always
[40:04.900 --> 40:09.540]  killing each other fighting over who's the most extreme it's like importing
[40:09.540 --> 40:14.740]  cancer into your country it always wants to take you over there is the house of
[40:14.740 --> 40:18.100]  Islam and there is the house of war everything outside the house of Islam
[40:18.100 --> 40:26.300]  is the house of war Germans to work into their 70s to pay refugee welfare that's
[40:26.300 --> 40:31.180]  being announced by the German newspapers you cannot make that up
[40:31.180 --> 40:35.740]  migrants surge from Turkey nine times greater than last year because what did
[40:35.740 --> 40:41.180]  the dictator of Turkey say he said you let me set up Turkish parties in every
[40:41.180 --> 40:45.140]  country then the Muslims will vote for the Turkish party and then they will have
[40:45.140 --> 40:50.660]  control with that tipping group of Europe and Germany said no and other
[40:50.660 --> 40:54.540]  countries banned the Islamic parties because they get it to total takeover
[40:54.540 --> 40:59.540]  they just want to happen that fast and so he now just open the borders up you
[40:59.540 --> 41:05.420]  see the economic terrorism Trudeau government welcomes back former ISIS
[41:05.420 --> 41:13.500]  fighters offers counseling yeah remember the guy that shot the army officer at
[41:13.500 --> 41:19.500]  their capital in Ottawa and what they do they let the guy basically go that did
[41:19.500 --> 41:22.140]  it and said you didn't do anything wrong and now it's the same thing Justin
[41:22.140 --> 41:25.260]  Trudeau's administration says that Canadians who leave their country to
[41:25.260 --> 41:28.740]  join ISIS have a right to return and will be offered counseling to the
[41:28.740 --> 41:33.220]  terrorist sympathizers you go fight to kill non-radical Muslims and Christians
[41:33.220 --> 41:36.660]  and put people into sex slavery you get your butt kicked by the Russians and
[41:36.660 --> 41:43.820]  then you come back to Canada remember oh he's had to mankind out of their
[41:43.820 --> 41:47.460]  national anthem and they put in federal documents two months ago no more
[41:47.460 --> 41:51.420]  mother and father don't put it on forms or you will be prosecuted mother and
[41:51.420 --> 41:58.980]  father is evil it doesn't even sound real does it migrant calls host racist

[47:00.860 --> 47:07.860]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:31.820 --> 47:38.500]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[47:38.500 --> 47:47.540]  listening to Alex Jones show Western culture Christian culture is under
[47:47.540 --> 47:52.460]  attack by Hollywood the big mega corporations big tech Islam you name it
[47:52.460 --> 47:58.420]  I can't go to any Islamic country and try to set up a church or go out and
[47:58.420 --> 48:01.580]  preach the Bible you will get killed so fast it'll make your headspin
[48:01.580 --> 48:06.100]  women can't go to these Islamic countries and not be wearing a scarf or
[48:06.100 --> 48:09.700]  headdress that's a fact but then we're told we're gonna bring something in
[48:09.700 --> 48:16.060]  that's incompatible so that's why I'm so upset and I was against the wars by the
[48:16.060 --> 48:20.580]  way because that was by the globalist to go destabilize those countries even
[48:20.580 --> 48:24.460]  more to put the worst Muslims in charge then get rid of Europe's borders and
[48:24.460 --> 48:29.260]  flood Europe and flood Russia but Russia is saying no and that's why Russia
[48:29.260 --> 48:38.180]  is under attack now I'm done talking about that for now but it is such a big
[48:38.180 --> 48:47.980]  deal that the New York Times has had to admit ahead of Congress making the man
[48:47.980 --> 48:50.660]  that tried to make himself the head of the Justice Department who actually
[48:50.660 --> 48:54.580]  changed the way the Justice Department works trick the president to signing it on
[48:54.580 --> 49:00.260]  January 21st Rosenstein changed the whole structure where he's in charge
[49:00.260 --> 49:04.620]  well the president can sign an order changing that any time but they've
[49:04.620 --> 49:08.380]  buffaloed the president into believing that if he removes any of these people
[49:08.380 --> 49:15.220]  that a rogue mad dogs like Mueller or Rosenstein or Strach or any of these
[49:15.220 --> 49:20.940]  scumbags like McCabe who he has made to step down that somehow it shows he's
[49:20.940 --> 49:25.940]  guilty that's like saying let somebody burn your house down or it proves you're
[49:25.940 --> 49:28.260]  guilty
[49:29.580 --> 49:33.340]  Trump has delivered on every front they have been all over Trump and found no
[49:33.340 --> 49:38.860]  corruption now they found his lawyer got money from a drug company and from AT&T
[49:38.860 --> 49:43.380]  totally normal as a lobbyist that he's been lobbying for years had nothing to
[49:43.380 --> 49:47.060]  do with anything Trump's the one that wouldn't hire one lobbyist he's cut
[49:47.060 --> 49:53.020]  lobbying back 95% almost every lobbying firm including Republicans are against
[49:53.020 --> 49:57.180]  this president you think the lobbyist like him when the whole media and all
[49:57.180 --> 50:04.260]  the lobbyists are against him no they are against the president because he is
[50:04.260 --> 50:08.220]  trying to turn the economy back on and trying to control the borders and trying
[50:08.220 --> 50:12.780]  to fix the VA and trying to stand up to China and trying to get peace deals with
[50:12.780 --> 50:22.340]  North Korea and in response Bolton the big neocon people said oh we'll
[50:22.340 --> 50:25.780]  trouble controlling oh really just like McMaster running around saying the
[50:25.780 --> 50:29.780]  opposite what the president says telling North Korea oh we're gonna do to you we
[50:29.780 --> 50:35.500]  did to Libya so they don't have a peace deal it's incredible now I've got so

[55:27.660 --> 55:37.620]  all right let me mention some really important news as we got a break here
[55:38.020 --> 55:44.980]  this is a report out of the world Mercury project it links through to major
[55:44.980 --> 55:52.420]  studies in Sweden and mainstream news articles out of Europe this all came out
[55:52.420 --> 55:56.780]  during the trials 12 years ago where there were deaths cervical cancer auto
[55:56.780 --> 56:01.620]  immune diseases the insert admits that it can kill you and that it does not
[56:01.620 --> 56:05.940]  protect you from the thousands of strains of HPV that only kill about 4,000
[56:05.940 --> 56:09.220]  people a year but since they started giving the Gardasil shot in North
[56:09.220 --> 56:15.860]  America guess what happened to deaths from cervical cancer they've tripled to
[56:15.860 --> 56:22.260]  well over 12,000 a year Gardasil could not get approved by the FDA but they
[56:22.260 --> 56:26.700]  had a governor declare an emergency and say that he wanted it given which then
[56:26.700 --> 56:31.980]  kicked in vaccine preparedness and kicked in COG and the vaccine damage
[56:31.980 --> 56:37.540]  fund federally and so Merck put it on the market and now it's on info wars
[56:37.540 --> 56:43.700]  com please get the article and email it to every parent you know especially that
[56:43.700 --> 56:49.020]  has young children because now they're pushing it on boys in school it is a
[56:49.020 --> 56:56.380]  live cancer virus now technically it hasn't been attenuated the classical
[56:56.380 --> 57:00.420]  sense they claim it's still attenuated but it's it's genetically engineered so
[57:00.420 --> 57:06.820]  the attenuation doesn't work it's very sophisticated HPV vaccine linked to
[57:06.820 --> 57:11.660]  spike in cervical cancer when the US introduced the human papillomavirus in
[57:11.660 --> 57:16.660]  2006 it had been steadily declining for several decades and then it goes in to
[57:16.660 --> 57:21.100]  say it's now gone up a similar trend also underway in Europe including Scandinavia
[57:21.100 --> 57:25.340]  with the region of Sweden stood out as having the lowest levels of cervical
[57:25.340 --> 57:30.020]  cancer now that they have been given it cervical cancer is up and it gets into
[57:30.020 --> 57:36.340]  all the other diseases and problems and the autoimmune problems it causes I
[57:36.340 --> 57:40.500]  mean this is just crazy so we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen but be
[57:40.500 --> 57:45.100]  aware these vaccines I'm not saying the science of vaccines isn't real but it's
[57:45.100 --> 57:50.580]  what they put in these it's population control we'll be back Western Europe has
[57:50.580 --> 57:55.220]  already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is sending down
[57:55.220 --> 58:01.580]  over the UK they're set to pass rules not a law that if you criticize Islam or
[58:01.580 --> 58:06.940]  gays you'll get six months in prison we know we're only about a year or two behind
[58:06.940 --> 58:10.820]  what's happening in the UK CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be
[58:10.820 --> 58:15.060]  shut down taken off the web slate magazine has a professor and others
[58:15.060 --> 58:20.060]  saying go beyond censorship brainwash young people against info wars

[1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:45.980]  but first Turkey calls for World War three I told people this on Tuesday on
[1:00:45.980 --> 1:00:49.620]  Wednesday they came out and openly said it in the US papers this is
[1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:54.460]  unprecedented here is that special report Turkey's president Erdogan is emerging
[1:00:54.460 --> 1:00:59.260]  as a true tyrant that could launch World War three last year as the Daily Mail
[1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:04.260]  reported Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu threatened to blow the
[1:01:04.260 --> 1:01:09.660]  mind of Europe by sending 15,000 refugees a month to EU territory this
[1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:14.460]  after the landmark deal signed by Ankara in Brussels that had substantially
[1:01:14.460 --> 1:01:19.780]  lessened the flow of migrants from Turkey to Europe and they have set up political parties
[1:01:19.780 --> 1:01:25.260]  inside Europe that even Germany has outlawed because you've got some
[1:01:25.260 --> 1:01:29.580]  countries that are 10 15 20 percent Muslim Turkey then organizes them to
[1:01:29.580 --> 1:01:39.420]  vote as the Turkish dictator tells them to so it's amazing and now they
[1:01:39.420 --> 1:01:47.580]  threatened last year and this year to quote burn down Europe if they didn't
[1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:52.980]  do what your gun said Erdogan and then if they didn't let more refugees in so
[1:01:52.980 --> 1:01:59.740]  they'd have a bigger voting block let more of us in let the Turkish
[1:01:59.740 --> 1:02:04.780]  government direct these groups or we'll flood you with more people and order
[1:02:04.780 --> 1:02:09.740]  them to burn Europe down those are statements from his deputy minister
[1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:14.340]  from the Turkish government Turkey's going the way of radical Islam what is
[1:02:14.340 --> 1:02:17.620]  the current situation in Turkey there's something which I call the gravity of
[1:02:17.620 --> 1:02:22.180]  Muhammad people may move will Muslims may move away from Muhammad but
[1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:26.500]  ultimately they'll be pulled back into his orbit historically at a Turk tried
[1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:32.580]  to suppress what we would call Islam by various and sundry methods one of which
[1:02:32.580 --> 1:02:39.140]  is is to put in the army as a military as a counterbalance to the Imams well
[1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:44.940]  out of Turkey is now formally dead Erdogan is brought as is really finished
[1:02:44.940 --> 1:02:50.180]  off out of Turkey and he wants to bring forth Turkey as a basically not a
[1:02:50.180 --> 1:02:54.780]  Western nation but as an Islamic nation one of them the mistakes you make in
[1:02:54.780 --> 1:02:58.100]  dealing with Islam and its demands is think well if we give him this they'll
[1:02:58.100 --> 1:03:04.340]  be happy and satisfied the Muhammad was never satisfied until all submitted to
[1:03:04.340 --> 1:03:09.740]  Islam Erdogan's advisor you get bullet recently threatened the Greek Prime
[1:03:09.740 --> 1:03:14.300]  Minister Alexis Tsipras saying Turkey would break the arms and legs of any
[1:03:14.300 --> 1:03:20.300]  officers of the Prime Minister or of any minister who dares to step into IMEA in
[1:03:20.300 --> 1:03:25.660]  the Aegean Express UK reported back in March of 2018 the Turkish States media
[1:03:25.660 --> 1:03:29.900]  mouthpiece Yenny Safak had suggested forming a joint army to
[1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:34.940]  simultaneously attack Israel from all sides Yenny Safak suggested if the
[1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:39.180]  member states of the OIC unite militarily they will form the world's
[1:03:39.180 --> 1:03:44.020]  largest and most comprehensive army and now Erdogan has booted the Israeli
[1:03:44.020 --> 1:03:48.420]  ambassador out of Turkey after labeling the recent clash on the Gaza border
[1:03:48.420 --> 1:03:53.220]  genocide the violence a result of a protest of the US Embassy moving to
[1:03:53.220 --> 1:03:57.620]  Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli troops that left thousands
[1:03:57.620 --> 1:04:03.540]  wounded and 62 dead and now that his little precious caliphate is in trouble
[1:04:03.540 --> 1:04:09.400]  Erdogan this lunatic maniac who had a bunch of his security people beat up
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:14.780]  Christians protesting at their embassy in DC oh you're a couple hundred
[1:04:14.780 --> 1:04:22.060]  Christians Armenians protesting Turkey's ongoing abuse of Christians and
[1:04:22.060 --> 1:04:26.980]  others you're across the street of the park here let's let 50 security guys
[1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:31.740]  come across and beat you up and even hit police and then the charges were all
[1:04:31.740 --> 1:04:35.420]  dropped on him last time I checked and right this very minute Americans are
[1:04:35.420 --> 1:04:39.540]  being held captive as political bargaining chips in Turkish prisons
[1:04:39.540 --> 1:04:44.900]  fortunately Erdogan's threats add up to arrogant bluster as Turkey's economy is
[1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:49.700]  running on fumes the Turkish lira ranks as one of the worst currencies this
[1:04:49.700 --> 1:04:53.860]  year and over a million Turks have taken to social media saying enough
[1:04:53.860 --> 1:04:59.500]  meaning Erdogan should step down immediately I want to plow into all of
[1:04:59.500 --> 1:05:04.900]  this I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to
[1:05:04.900 --> 1:05:10.820]  understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or
[1:05:10.820 --> 1:05:17.940]  videos or other material from info or store.com you are funding the revolution

[1:06:19.060 --> 1:06:24.100]  The killing of Uncle Sam I just read it a few weeks ago Pastor Rodney Howard
[1:06:24.100 --> 1:06:27.740]  Brown one of the bravest preachers in the world of course he's an American but
[1:06:27.740 --> 1:06:32.100]  he grew up in South Africa and we're just really really pleased to have him
[1:06:32.100 --> 1:06:35.940]  the demise of the United States of America now he gave us 500 books I've
[1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:38.980]  ordered a thousand more they're coming in next week it starts shipping next
[1:06:38.980 --> 1:06:44.460]  Tuesday but he does have audiobooks on CD and audible.com that also start

[1:06:47.740 --> 1:06:52.180]  just be sure and get them and we're gonna break down the book we're gonna
[1:06:52.180 --> 1:06:55.980]  cover it all with one of my favorite pastors Rodney Howard Brown he was
[1:06:55.980 --> 1:07:00.700]  covered it with Paul L Williams all these former top guys in the CIA you name
[1:07:00.700 --> 1:07:04.260]  it helped him write the book and I've read I've read Carol Quigley's book I've
[1:07:04.260 --> 1:07:08.180]  read you know from the globalist own perspective and I'm telling you this is
[1:07:08.180 --> 1:07:14.060]  the book to read this is fast-paced it's thick it's condensed but if you want a
[1:07:14.060 --> 1:07:17.580]  PhD in the New World Order this is the book you have really put out a masterpiece
[1:07:17.580 --> 1:07:22.300]  Pastor. Well let me tell you how to happen. Hey great to be here yeah let me tell you
[1:07:22.300 --> 1:07:26.780]  how to happen you know when when I was looking at the situation in America and
[1:07:26.780 --> 1:07:31.020]  I was I was concerned because I could see that we were heading for another
[1:07:31.020 --> 1:07:35.540]  situation whereby that we're gonna push another Bush or another Clinton so many
[1:07:35.540 --> 1:07:40.100]  people actually have no clue what's taking place they think that it's a
[1:07:40.100 --> 1:07:43.900]  Republican-Democratic thing it's not this whole thing's been cooked a long time
[1:07:43.900 --> 1:07:49.980]  again ago a Republican-Democrat are two heads of the same snake so I was so
[1:07:49.980 --> 1:07:53.940]  frustrated about it because you know we came to America as missionaries my
[1:07:53.940 --> 1:07:58.620]  wife and I came here 30 years ago with $300 landed America and then of course
[1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:02.420]  we became an American we had to raise our hands to place to defend the
[1:08:02.420 --> 1:08:06.380]  Constitution against enemies foreign or domestic and here we are watching
[1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:10.140]  politicians that also raised their hand to place to defend the Constitution
[1:08:10.140 --> 1:08:14.260]  selling selling America out for pennies on the dollar which I couldn't even
[1:08:14.260 --> 1:08:18.380]  understand so I felt when I was looking at this and then we have all the
[1:08:18.380 --> 1:08:21.500]  politicians come around the church you know there are they want to all address
[1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:26.260]  the congregation I even had one guy just running for Congress and we tell them if
[1:08:26.260 --> 1:08:30.460]  you come to church you're gonna sit in the service and we I don't have a 90 of
[1:08:30.460 --> 1:08:34.980]  hour service a 90 minute we have a three hour plus service I'm from Africa and so
[1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:38.620]  I said you come to my church you sang for the whole thing he said I'm busy I
[1:08:38.620 --> 1:08:41.700]  said I don't care how busy are you gonna stay the whole thing and if you leave
[1:08:41.700 --> 1:08:44.860]  halfway through I'll denounce you publicly I'll tell them don't vote for
[1:08:44.860 --> 1:08:50.500]  that guy he's a con man so we had a service and the guy is in the service
[1:08:50.500 --> 1:08:53.260]  he starts leaving and I went like this to one of my guys they went and got him
[1:08:53.260 --> 1:08:56.580]  said pastor said you better get your butt back in the in the service he said
[1:08:56.580 --> 1:09:00.500]  you kidding me said no so he came in when I gave the altar call he was the first
[1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:05.060]  guy up to come and give his life to the Lord you know so anyway so we we I'm a
[1:09:05.060 --> 1:09:12.020]  radical you know I give away a hour 15s on a Sunday morning so but in I felt
[1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:16.620]  that we had to go do something so we went to Constitution Hall right by the
[1:09:16.620 --> 1:09:20.780]  White House the Constitution Hall is a historical building I wanted to get as
[1:09:20.780 --> 1:09:24.900]  close to the White House as I could and then you know of course Obama's there
[1:09:24.900 --> 1:09:27.660]  and and you know here's the thing I didn't agree with anything that he was
[1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:31.060]  doing because we come from South Africa so we've already seen the game that's
[1:09:31.060 --> 1:09:35.260]  been played South Africa sitting right now on the brink of a civil war if we
[1:09:35.260 --> 1:09:39.180]  don't see a miracle because it's socialism it's total communism that's
[1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:43.540]  just taken root in every way now to land grabs they've got everybody killing
[1:09:43.540 --> 1:09:47.740]  each other so but that's another story that I want to discuss now I wanted to
[1:09:47.740 --> 1:09:51.700]  cover that next hour that was on my list I'm glad you raised that yeah so so when
[1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:55.820]  I saw this I thought I have to do something so I said what can I do to get
[1:09:55.820 --> 1:09:59.500]  as close to the White House as possible so we rented Constitution Hall for 15
[1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:04.100]  nights and I went and I stood up and exposed everything from the private
[1:10:04.100 --> 1:10:08.740]  central bank to the way that America is being run and then but what I'd done
[1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:13.180]  leading up to it I walked every office of the Congress in the Senate it took me
[1:10:13.180 --> 1:10:17.500]  eight weeks to do I took this book which we call seeing Jesus as he really is
[1:10:17.500 --> 1:10:22.020]  because people think that Jesus is some kind of little barefoot with a
[1:10:22.020 --> 1:10:26.740]  llama in his arms speaking Elizabethan English that's not Jesus because he took
[1:10:26.740 --> 1:10:31.300]  whips and beat the bankers of the day and turned over their tables Jesus was
[1:10:31.300 --> 1:10:36.780]  not a skinny jeans soy latte drinking pastor he let me tell you people people
[1:10:36.780 --> 1:10:40.540]  don't even read the Bible then they say well Jesus wouldn't do that go read the
[1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:45.060]  Bible he did do that so I took that book and I took this book which is the
[1:10:45.060 --> 1:10:48.940]  route of life after death heaven and hell and we print a 50,000 copies of
[1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:53.100]  each and we stuck this in every office of the Congress in the Senate because I
[1:10:53.100 --> 1:10:55.900]  didn't know you know I'm desperate I can't I don't know what we're gonna see
[1:10:55.900 --> 1:10:59.460]  what are we gonna have another another bush another Clinton which they are
[1:10:59.460 --> 1:11:02.540]  friends they've been household friends the book the Clintons in the bushes have
[1:11:02.540 --> 1:11:06.940]  been friends when I was in the back room they brought this this is 94 I'm in the
[1:11:06.940 --> 1:11:10.460]  back room getting ready to bring a 94 year old little lady she's been on the
[1:11:10.460 --> 1:11:16.140]  hill her husband was in Congress in the 60s and so she's on a walk and I thought
[1:11:16.140 --> 1:11:22.540]  now apparently they said she worked for Bush senior so I thought okay Rodney
[1:11:22.540 --> 1:11:26.660]  shut up do not mention the bushes don't you know don't hurt the little lady so
[1:11:26.660 --> 1:11:31.660]  she said anything so I'm quiet and she looks at me she goes the bushes I said
[1:11:31.660 --> 1:11:37.860]  yes ma'am who wicked people she says I said Ruth how can you say that she's
[1:11:37.860 --> 1:11:43.220]  like you know I'm playing dumb you know she said they were shipping now and she
[1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:47.660]  start talking about Bohemian Grove you know which you you exposed so anyway so
[1:11:47.660 --> 1:11:52.420]  I expose all the stuff one night after the service a huge six for four African
[1:11:52.420 --> 1:11:57.140]  American a gentleman come to me put out his hand very you know surely shook my
[1:11:57.140 --> 1:12:00.740]  hand he said I work for the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve and I
[1:12:00.740 --> 1:12:05.300]  burst out laughing and then he said everything you're saying is true you
[1:12:05.300 --> 1:12:10.380]  know so and then so right off to another one of the services dr. Paul
[1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:15.380]  Williams came to me he is a former FBI in actual fact he uncovered all the
[1:12:15.380 --> 1:12:20.020]  ISIS bases in America that the CIA have built to train ISIS to ship them to the
[1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:23.780]  areas of the planet that they need to create problems because if you have a
[1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:27.020]  country that by the way you talked about that years ago others did it now Fox
[1:12:27.020 --> 1:12:30.700]  News it's all confirmed the witnesses have come forward of Obama and Hillary
[1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:37.100]  shipping hundreds of aircraft with heavy weapons anti-aircraft rockets anti-tank
[1:12:37.100 --> 1:12:41.420]  tow missiles to them they did it but the bushes will also complicit a lot of the
[1:12:41.420 --> 1:12:45.460]  stuff and the Clintons so the whole thing is a cabal when when Nelson
[1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:50.060]  Mandela died Air Force one goes to the funeral in South Africa guess who's on
[1:12:50.060 --> 1:12:55.020]  board the bushes the Clintons and the Obama's like a club they all is Pally
[1:12:55.020 --> 1:12:57.900]  Pally the American people actually think there's a difference there is no
[1:12:57.900 --> 1:13:01.260]  difference so dr. Williams said I've never heard a preacher talk like you
[1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:05.460]  said I'm a I'm a writer I'm a scribe he said we need to sit down document all
[1:13:05.460 --> 1:13:11.180]  of this so we spent many hours from 2014 documenting everything we could have
[1:13:11.180 --> 1:13:15.180]  come out in January I felt a hold it off till now may 20 seconds gonna be
[1:13:15.180 --> 1:13:20.300]  released you can order through info wars and the the the actual book and then
[1:13:20.300 --> 1:13:24.660]  the audio book which you're gonna get next week it'll be available on kindle
[1:13:24.660 --> 1:13:28.500]  and every place that you're able to get books what I'm trying to do is to run
[1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:33.060]  this thing into airports into I know Barnes & Noble's working with us which
[1:13:33.060 --> 1:13:36.500]  that's great well it's a beautiful cover but I it was good enough to make me
[1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:40.460]  read it plus I respect you and it's just I already have researched all this I
[1:13:40.460 --> 1:13:42.620]  know it's very accurate but then there were lots of little things I didn't know
[1:13:42.620 --> 1:13:46.380]  that added to it I went and looked it up and it was all accurate so I learned a
[1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:49.660]  lot and again there's so much history to thick book but it's a lot of little
[1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:53.500]  chapters it moves very very fast and what we did was basically we stayed with
[1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:56.380]  the money because there were many things you know how when you go down this
[1:13:56.380 --> 1:14:01.140]  trail there are many rabbit trails so basically what we decided to do was to
[1:14:01.140 --> 1:14:05.860]  keep it staying around the money what's the problem in America why is America in
[1:14:05.860 --> 1:14:10.740]  the condition it's in why is it that we vote people into office every four years
[1:14:10.740 --> 1:14:15.900]  there's a change and yet we still keep going down the toilet is it just oh well
[1:14:15.900 --> 1:14:20.380]  that's just politics that's a bunch of garbage total garbage and if you believe
[1:14:20.380 --> 1:14:23.980]  that then you're smoking some of the bad legalized weed that they've already
[1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:28.740]  you take the entire British Empire model which then was picked up by the
[1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:32.740]  corporatist to establish this new world government and it's all in their own
[1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:37.100]  words this is a real plan we're breaking down and the book the killing of Uncle
[1:14:37.100 --> 1:14:41.820]  Sam lays it out just because there's a thousand footnotes the bibliographies
[1:14:41.820 --> 1:14:46.340]  15 pages long this is all documented we actually in a build a website where we
[1:14:46.340 --> 1:14:50.660]  actually put video clips of the actual people saying what they're saying so we
[1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:55.940]  not when I'm making people say oh that's a conspiracy theory hey a conspiracy is
[1:14:55.940 --> 1:15:01.540]  a secret plot to do a theory is when you think there's one but conspiracy fact
[1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:05.220]  this is conspiracy fact this is not and there's one thing they fear it's getting
[1:15:05.220 --> 1:15:08.620]  people to understand there's a conspiracy just like Mueller against Trump and
[1:15:08.620 --> 1:15:13.300]  now it's all been confirmed but they were so dumb they bragged when he was
[1:15:13.300 --> 1:15:16.540]  president elect always spied on and we've got the goods well they spied they
[1:15:16.540 --> 1:15:19.140]  didn't have the goods then they tried to pull back now they've been caught
[1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:22.980]  perjuring themselves the Congress when we come back we'll talk about it with
[1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:26.860]  again the author of killing of Uncle Sam the demise of the United States of

[1:21:03.500 --> 1:21:07.100]  broke so he's signaling hey we've got you illegally spying we've got you lying
[1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:10.700]  to congress we've got you on the tarmac with russians giving him uranium we've
[1:21:10.700 --> 1:21:15.900]  got you with a very oligarch Mueller who you say that trumps involved with I mean
[1:21:15.900 --> 1:21:19.300]  they went Russia Russia Russia because the clintons were involved up their
[1:21:19.300 --> 1:21:25.220]  eyeballs with Russia and so now juliani's trying to signal to them hey
[1:21:25.220 --> 1:21:30.780]  just stop it let's have a truce in my gut but also intellectually faster I
[1:21:30.780 --> 1:21:35.420]  know that that is not what they're planning and so here's one more clip
[1:21:35.420 --> 1:21:41.020]  from juliani again saying if they illegally spied they've been caught
[1:21:41.020 --> 1:21:46.100]  it's admitted the FISA court issued a report last year and again this year
[1:21:46.100 --> 1:21:49.740]  saying it was illegal that they were lied to and and the judges have said
[1:21:49.740 --> 1:21:53.540]  they lied to get these warrants and they use it for political purposes it's in
[1:21:53.540 --> 1:21:58.140]  the news New York Times today comes out and confirms FBI ran spy operation
[1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:02.060]  against Trump campaign that was illegal pastor Rodney Howard Brown we're gonna
[1:22:02.060 --> 1:22:05.900]  play this clip but do you agree with me on that totally I mean what people don't
[1:22:05.900 --> 1:22:09.100]  understand the narrative is being spun by the mainstream media because the
[1:22:09.100 --> 1:22:13.420]  media was taken over through operation mockingbird and that whatever you see
[1:22:13.420 --> 1:22:19.340]  from MSN you it's propaganda I mean it doesn't matter who you're watching so
[1:22:19.340 --> 1:22:22.220]  they're gonna spend the narrative people don't realize that Reuters and
[1:22:22.220 --> 1:22:27.060]  Associated Press were taken over so they put out the AP and then everybody just
[1:22:27.060 --> 1:22:30.140]  swallows that and that's the narrative so you know that's right there's always
[1:22:30.140 --> 1:22:34.380]  been some problems but now they will flat out lie about the sky being blue I
[1:22:34.380 --> 1:22:38.780]  mean they will just lie and I mean one day be saying we've been spying on Trump
[1:22:38.780 --> 1:22:43.340]  and no he's a Russian we have all the wiretaps next day January 20th we never
[1:22:43.340 --> 1:22:50.660]  did it it's made up it's insane in December of 2016 I was in the Ukraine
[1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:57.860]  and anyway so while I was in the Ukraine through the church it's a huge
[1:22:57.860 --> 1:23:01.460]  church of thousands of people and there were people from the government there
[1:23:01.460 --> 1:23:04.460]  and they said look will I meet with the future ambassador to the United States I
[1:23:04.460 --> 1:23:08.420]  said sure so he come to my hotel and he said to me look I he brought me this
[1:23:08.420 --> 1:23:11.780]  document said would you give this to Trump's administration I said for what
[1:23:11.780 --> 1:23:17.340]  they said we want to apologize for backing Hillary he said we supported
[1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:22.700]  Hillary so I knew that in December of 2016 so I brought that back and of course
[1:23:22.700 --> 1:23:25.740]  got it through the channels which I'm not sure if it got anywhere but this was
[1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:30.580]  all the Ukrainian government apologizing for the way that they backed
[1:23:30.580 --> 1:23:34.420]  Hillary over Trump and they realized they in trouble now of course it's come
[1:23:34.420 --> 1:23:38.060]  out now that they were running a big election operation illegally against
[1:23:38.060 --> 1:23:43.740]  Trump totally so you got the subversive stuff going on and basically doing
[1:23:43.740 --> 1:23:46.740]  whatever they can't do to stop the president which they couldn't two
[1:23:46.740 --> 1:23:50.180]  billion dollars worth the media against him couldn't stop him the
[1:23:50.180 --> 1:23:52.660]  Republicans were against him you know that's why I laugh when they hear
[1:23:52.660 --> 1:23:56.340]  Republicans are upset with them they were always upset with them they didn't
[1:23:56.340 --> 1:24:00.900]  want Trump to be this this is I feel in my gut but also historically and you see
[1:24:00.900 --> 1:24:05.260]  this biblically God gives people one last chance and it to turn it around so
[1:24:05.260 --> 1:24:08.700]  people think oh it's Providence he's divinely inspired you know he can't be
[1:24:08.700 --> 1:24:11.900]  stopped I don't agree with that I think if we don't back Trump if we aren't
[1:24:11.900 --> 1:24:15.580]  strong if we don't pray if we're not active if we're not courageous I think
[1:24:15.580 --> 1:24:18.580]  God will step aside and let this whole thing fall this is a last minute
[1:24:18.580 --> 1:24:23.100]  reprieve in actual fact dr. Paul Williams when we were writing this he said I want
[1:24:23.100 --> 1:24:26.700]  the last chapter to be called the reign of Jezebel and I looked at him said
[1:24:26.700 --> 1:24:32.500]  absolutely not absolutely not she's not getting in he said she she says no way
[1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:37.340]  she's not gonna win I said she is not gonna get in we had all night premiums
[1:24:37.340 --> 1:24:40.860]  at the church you know and I didn't support trying to drop was gonna win
[1:24:40.860 --> 1:24:43.900]  yeah I didn't support him was a Republican to Democrat because both
[1:24:43.900 --> 1:24:47.100]  Republican Democrat are wicked I supported him because he was an
[1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:51.380]  outsider and was not funded by the globalist to come and you could see that
[1:24:51.380 --> 1:24:56.540]  genuinely the globalist hating in the way the Pope is against him the world's
[1:24:56.540 --> 1:25:02.020]  financial elite and offices against him the former Mexican Mexican you know
[1:25:02.020 --> 1:25:06.060]  president does it gets him everybody I said okay well that tells you who we
[1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:10.300]  supposed to support right there Hollywood all of it they are just but
[1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:14.180]  what are they gonna do you know why the Hollywood was against him because what
[1:25:14.180 --> 1:25:19.660]  happened in Europe the EU had voted to fund all of the EU's all the film
[1:25:19.660 --> 1:25:23.660]  industry through the EU through through the through you know whatever they have
[1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:27.980]  their their system of the money and Trump had already that bill was already
[1:25:27.980 --> 1:25:32.100]  passed by the House to allow Hollywood to be supported by the tax-paying
[1:25:32.100 --> 1:25:37.420]  Americans and Trump went in and next that that's why Hollywood daily harasses
[1:25:37.420 --> 1:25:41.300]  the president guess what it's failed on them nobody even watches them you know
[1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:47.220]  CNN out of 25 networks are in the cable newsnet let me spend on that number 24
[1:25:47.220 --> 1:25:51.500]  behind the FX which is the science fiction channel and right off the American
[1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:58.700]  movie classics duh reruns of Yogi bear is higher than CNN who wants to watch it
[1:25:58.700 --> 1:26:03.500]  well expanding and the cost to actually a cost to set the day he said if the
[1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:07.620]  president would only let me interview him who does he even think he is he
[1:26:07.620 --> 1:26:13.300]  shouldn't even be reporting for a special pets monthly broadcast cost has been
[1:26:13.300 --> 1:26:17.380]  caught lying over and over again oh there's no Martin Luther King bus in the
[1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:21.780]  White House oh he didn't go Trump didn't visit Scalise he just he's an
[1:26:21.780 --> 1:26:26.340]  incessant liar the whole time the whole narrative is almost like that the media
[1:26:26.340 --> 1:26:32.540]  cannot stop for lying because they so hate the president I hate it so they
[1:26:32.540 --> 1:26:35.660]  can't they're gonna no matter what he does they're gonna lie about it and so
[1:26:35.660 --> 1:26:40.420]  you can see you know I saw somebody else said today that you know looks like
[1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:44.660]  Trump is undermining the justice the justice system was undermined years ago
[1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:49.060]  read the book read the book the justice system was done away with years ago
[1:26:49.060 --> 1:26:54.020]  everything's being compromised from here's the thing Alex that the biggest
[1:26:54.020 --> 1:26:57.740]  problem people don't understand we talk about how they took schooling and they
[1:26:57.740 --> 1:27:02.220]  standardized it and they and they basically dumbed everybody down so even
[1:27:02.220 --> 1:27:07.060]  the universities now I mean look at the leftist leftist professors and
[1:27:07.060 --> 1:27:10.820]  everything pumping that's why you got these writing on the on the university
[1:27:10.820 --> 1:27:13.900]  campuses because you got students that don't even know what the truth is
[1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:18.100]  anymore they have no clue they don't even know history and so then they took
[1:27:18.100 --> 1:27:23.820]  over the seminaries through Fosdick funded by Rockefeller and that's the
[1:27:23.820 --> 1:27:27.540]  funding for Harvard Yale and Princeton you know everybody talks about accreditation
[1:27:27.540 --> 1:27:31.060]  Harvard Yale and Princeton are not accredited who's gonna question Harvard
[1:27:31.060 --> 1:27:34.260]  Yale and Princeton but they were all evangelical Bible schools that actually
[1:27:34.260 --> 1:27:36.980]  raised people up to go to the mission fields and when you go there the
[1:27:36.980 --> 1:27:40.660]  scriptures are engraved in the mob and now they're talking about tearing that
[1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:43.940]  out yeah because they hate it they want to tell you the atheist and the
[1:27:43.940 --> 1:27:47.140]  Rockefellers created the country and all this and none of its true how did
[1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:50.620]  their scriptures get in there even in the halls of Congress the first major
[1:27:50.620 --> 1:27:54.060]  church was in the Capitol building Washington started that in the Marine
[1:27:54.060 --> 1:27:58.980]  Dam band at the praise and worship and and the daily Congress could not open
[1:27:58.980 --> 1:28:02.940]  without praise and worship so now we're sitting living where you can't say
[1:28:02.940 --> 1:28:06.900]  anything who do these people think that by the way it was real Christianity that
[1:28:06.900 --> 1:28:10.100]  gave us our providence our power and that's what the globalist want us to get
[1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:14.500]  rid of it because they know it gives us that providence and that power over the
[1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:17.420]  world they want us to give up our birthright because the first great
[1:28:17.420 --> 1:28:23.420]  awakening in the 1700s is what took 13 rebel colonies and put them together to
[1:28:23.420 --> 1:28:29.340]  make us what become what America would become 50 50 states that would be 50
[1:28:29.340 --> 1:28:34.700]  nations joined together by divine providence there was no ways we could
[1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:39.300]  defeat the British might if it had not been for the hand of God period that's

[1:33:43.940 --> 1:33:49.780]  store dot com but but separately I was told some things early on in the trump
[1:33:49.780 --> 1:33:57.380]  campaign that made me begin to endorse him and my gut already liked him but then
[1:33:57.380 --> 1:34:01.900]  I talked to some of my sources and look to say I have military sources or CIA
[1:34:01.900 --> 1:34:05.980]  sources most of the stuff we know is from the globalist own statements their
[1:34:05.980 --> 1:34:10.500]  own documents their own admissions 95% of the stuff's public so it's not like
[1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:17.740]  our broadcast is based on secret sources but once the trump campaign got going on
[1:34:17.740 --> 1:34:21.420]  I knew that Eric Prince was involved and I knew that they were aware that
[1:34:21.420 --> 1:34:24.780]  Hillary was planning the in free speech and they were planning to persecute
[1:34:24.780 --> 1:34:30.540]  christians even worse it was so bad that even people who are who are pretty
[1:34:30.540 --> 1:34:34.900]  mean said we're not doing this just to kick America around for no reason we're
[1:34:34.900 --> 1:34:38.780]  not gonna go ahead and just have a huge depression and let china take over so
[1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:45.300]  America got to its death bed it got to basically you know it's 11th hour and
[1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:51.900]  58 minutes and so it was the American people elected Trump but it was folks
[1:34:51.900 --> 1:34:56.980]  out of Florida the military and other groups that helped the American people
[1:34:56.980 --> 1:35:02.540]  work to get the WikiLeaks out I mean it was Eric Prince and and I was told this
[1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:06.340]  a long time ago but I was told just this week from several sources go ahead and go
[1:35:06.340 --> 1:35:11.580]  public with it because he's involved with the whole Cambridge Analytica and
[1:35:11.580 --> 1:35:15.820]  that whole demonization and they're gonna try to come after him but but but
[1:35:15.820 --> 1:35:18.220]  there were and it's not just Eric Prince was a bunch of other people in
[1:35:18.220 --> 1:35:22.020]  intelligence agencies that knew that this was the end of America if we didn't
[1:35:22.020 --> 1:35:25.940]  get Trump in or at least the Democrats were gonna move with the blue blood
[1:35:25.940 --> 1:35:31.540]  Republicans to end it and that throughout the campaign you know Trump had
[1:35:31.540 --> 1:35:38.260]  Prince and others and and a private contingent of hundreds of former and
[1:35:38.260 --> 1:35:43.180]  current intelligence agency people running counter espionage against the
[1:35:43.180 --> 1:35:46.580]  Democrats then I can just tell you it was not the Russians that leaked all that
[1:35:46.580 --> 1:35:50.020]  information I can tell you that right now that there were patriots separate
[1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:53.580]  from Trump that ran intelligence operations against Hillary because she's
[1:35:53.580 --> 1:35:57.660]  a foreign globalist it was America did that America won America got Trump
[1:35:57.660 --> 1:36:02.300]  elected America gave the globalist a bloody nose and a broken jaw and so now
[1:36:02.300 --> 1:36:05.180]  they're counter striking back they're the globalists they're the outside force
[1:36:05.180 --> 1:36:08.740]  we're the Americans look at the country coming back from the dead we're the ones
[1:36:08.740 --> 1:36:12.900]  turning it around but then I was told let them try to remove Trump with their
[1:36:12.900 --> 1:36:17.780]  fake garbage extradition stuff because he's got the Marines and the army once
[1:36:17.780 --> 1:36:21.260]  he became president-elect and then president and camped around him and
[1:36:21.260 --> 1:36:25.980]  actually know that and so if rogue FBI and and rogue former intelligence heads
[1:36:25.980 --> 1:36:29.740]  are so arrogant think they're gonna pull this they're all being surveilled
[1:36:29.740 --> 1:36:34.460]  they're all being watched Trump has been coolly letting them commit all these
[1:36:34.460 --> 1:36:38.580]  crimes so that once he pulls the news they're totally caught and now Giuliani's
[1:36:38.580 --> 1:36:41.980]  on television saying we'll play that clip again in a moment you do one more
[1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:45.140]  thing you don't drop this down for the betterment of the country and you don't
[1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:50.140]  really run up the white flag we're gonna tear you into pieces let's go ahead and
[1:36:50.140 --> 1:36:55.420]  play that clip of Giuliani saying we're going to quote ready to rip them apart
[1:36:55.420 --> 1:37:00.660]  here it is timeline what is your optimal timeline for this to wrap up I
[1:37:00.660 --> 1:37:05.580]  should do it today I mean as soon as possible I think that they have the
[1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:08.500]  facts from which they can write their report if you're gonna write a fair
[1:37:08.500 --> 1:37:12.740]  report fine write it if you're gonna write an unfair report write it and we
[1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:17.620]  will combat it we're ready to rip it apart and we're ready to rip them apart
[1:37:17.620 --> 1:37:22.620]  if that's what they want we would rather peacefully settle this and get it over
[1:37:22.620 --> 1:37:27.020]  with now that that is a ultimatum from a former top federal prosecutor who
[1:37:27.020 --> 1:37:31.180]  almost brought down Clinton he's saying you got an ultimatum that's from the
[1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:35.380]  president so the president has issued an ultimatum that's what's happened what
[1:37:35.380 --> 1:37:39.500]  do you say to that pastor you know obviously I mean this thing's gone on
[1:37:39.500 --> 1:37:43.980]  long enough now I mean it's there and there's no proof of anything so it's
[1:37:43.980 --> 1:37:49.500]  just spinning the lies and keep spinning so you can see on social media the
[1:37:49.500 --> 1:37:54.020]  dumbed-down population of America responding to the lies of the mainstream
[1:37:54.020 --> 1:37:59.780]  media agreeing with it but I believe in the end this thing is gonna become what
[1:37:59.780 --> 1:38:03.620]  it's already unraveled but it's all gonna be exposed for what it is because we
[1:38:03.620 --> 1:38:08.500]  this is this is what input was is doing this is what you the info warrior are
[1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:14.300]  doing you waking up your friends don't be bashful or you know shy about it be
[1:38:14.300 --> 1:38:18.140]  vocal because if you don't speak out right now this is the main battle exactly
[1:38:18.140 --> 1:38:22.500]  this is the time and everybody has your voice needs to be heard because you're
[1:38:22.500 --> 1:38:26.340]  gonna reach people I can't reach you'll reach people Alex can't reach and you
[1:38:26.340 --> 1:38:29.500]  know when people look at that is so critical I don't just say it because I
[1:38:29.500 --> 1:38:32.740]  just kind of throw it out there it's true you the individuals of the power when
[1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:36.060]  you talk to people when you spread the word about what Pastor Brown's doing or
[1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:39.460]  what we're doing that overrides them that's what they can't control is you
[1:38:39.460 --> 1:38:43.540]  correct so people look at all the stuff we put in here was just 200 years of
[1:38:43.540 --> 1:38:46.980]  history they say it's overwhelming I can't do anything but here's the thing if
[1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:52.220]  everyone watching says what can I do you can pray you can ask God give me one
[1:38:52.220 --> 1:38:56.500]  thing that I must do and if everybody watching does one thing you can bring
[1:38:56.500 --> 1:39:00.340]  about a transformation in America like that we'll see a total transformation
[1:39:00.340 --> 1:39:04.860]  there's no question two women wreaked havoc on American society one took pray
[1:39:04.860 --> 1:39:08.020]  out of schools the other one started Planned Parenthood which has been the
[1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:12.060]  death of 27 million African-Americans just alone I gave the abortion numbers
[1:39:12.060 --> 1:39:16.260]  what 59 million now so come on 42% of blacks never get out of their mama so
[1:39:16.260 --> 1:39:20.340]  come on you don't hear a word did you see Spike Lee like a little demon going
[1:39:20.340 --> 1:39:24.600]  I mean how much did you see how much Trump he was like he turned into a
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:28.980]  gargoyle yeah they all even Keith Richards said and it was so crazy these
[1:39:28.980 --> 1:39:33.420]  are anti-gunners he said I'll pull out my knife you know a typical prick you
[1:39:33.420 --> 1:39:37.380]  know what I mean I'll pull out my knife if I get old of Trump so these people
[1:39:37.380 --> 1:39:40.260]  are crazy they're lunatic and they all signal how they want to kill or hurt
[1:39:40.260 --> 1:39:43.820]  Trump in fact can we play the beach one of course
[1:39:43.820 --> 1:39:50.460]  acutely up but but it's the way he looks for radio listeners he brings this violent hate out
[1:39:50.460 --> 1:39:53.900]  from Hollywood because it's spiritual yeah but you didn't see us doing that
[1:39:53.900 --> 1:39:57.860]  with the mama no you didn't see us doing that was with Bush you didn't see us
[1:39:57.860 --> 1:40:02.260]  doing that with Clinton we just have to sit and take it but they're doing that
[1:40:02.260 --> 1:40:06.380]  with Trump because they know the day is finished they know that he's
[1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:11.340]  neutralizing them he's castrated them since I mentioned it well let's do it
[1:40:11.340 --> 1:40:14.060]  the next segment the whole military thing well no let's go ahead and do it
[1:40:14.060 --> 1:40:16.140]  now go ahead and get into what you witnessed in Florida would do I mean
[1:40:16.140 --> 1:40:19.580]  how well they've got armored bunkers around that so I was concerned you know
[1:40:19.580 --> 1:40:23.100]  because I obviously understand how the deep state function and what's going on
[1:40:23.100 --> 1:40:29.300]  and so I I was really concerned for his safety but when we had to go in on a
[1:40:29.300 --> 1:40:33.660]  Sunday night I speak in West Palm Beach so we landed at the West Palm Beach
[1:40:33.660 --> 1:40:39.140]  Airport we pulled up to the FBO and Air Force one had just left now they told
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:43.100]  me if I didn't if I came in before I couldn't land in West Palm Beach I had
[1:40:43.100 --> 1:40:48.300]  to go down to I can't remember I think a lauderdale because it was a 30 mile
[1:40:48.300 --> 1:40:54.060]  blocked airways around more longer you couldn't get there so but Air Force one
[1:40:54.060 --> 1:40:57.300]  had left so we could land so we pulled right up and then right in front of us
[1:40:57.300 --> 1:41:02.180]  was this huge military transport vehicle Airport I mean huge where the nose
[1:41:02.180 --> 1:41:07.580]  lifts up galaxy yeah all of the all of the cars you know his own cars and all
[1:41:07.580 --> 1:41:10.820]  the Secret Service cars were rolling in there and as I was standing watching and
[1:41:10.820 --> 1:41:15.220]  I realized they protect in the present it's it's the military and I was actually
[1:41:15.220 --> 1:41:19.300]  fortunate for that then I realized that the presence actually walking out on
[1:41:19.300 --> 1:41:23.100]  line with the military so then I understood what happened when he said
[1:41:23.100 --> 1:41:26.340]  we're not going to Syria but then they went a bomb Syria but now he says we're
[1:41:26.340 --> 1:41:30.260]  not going to say so he's struggling with that but you know and I'm concerned
[1:41:30.260 --> 1:41:35.140]  about Bolton being around there because he's a war hawk as you know so you see
[1:41:35.140 --> 1:41:39.020]  this whole sit down with North Korea which needs to happen needs to happen
[1:41:39.020 --> 1:41:43.700]  now you've got Bolton needs to step aside and get away from it in actual fact
[1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:47.660]  Trump needs to override everybody and so I'm gonna meet with Putin I'm meeting
[1:41:47.660 --> 1:41:51.220]  with Putin I agree well he's already met with all the other world leaders so in a
[1:41:51.220 --> 1:41:57.180]  few areas this whole Russia thing has kind of they did it on purpose to stop
[1:41:57.180 --> 1:42:00.020]  him because they know that he'll sit down and work things out we don't need
[1:42:00.020 --> 1:42:03.180]  another we don't need a third world war right now well that's the globalist
[1:42:03.180 --> 1:42:07.620]  program they want ongoing crises strategic tension and Trump's pragmatic
[1:42:07.620 --> 1:42:11.340]  he just wants peace if people want war they'll get it but it's been globalist
[1:42:11.340 --> 1:42:15.020]  running America for so long that had been stirring up the problems and that's
[1:42:15.020 --> 1:42:21.780]  why they're so upset right now from World War I to World War II to 9 11 to the
[1:42:21.780 --> 1:42:25.500]  endless war that we find ourselves in and everybody thinks it's about terrorists
[1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:28.820]  well the terrorists are trained here and shipped overseas baby you better wake up
[1:42:28.820 --> 1:42:34.580]  stomp and smell the coffee plus and not only that it's about a pipeline Syria's
[1:42:34.580 --> 1:42:38.740]  about a pipeline it's about everybody hitting for the base of the Caspian Sea
[1:42:38.740 --> 1:42:42.620]  with all the natural resources that's what this whole fight is about Iraq and
[1:42:42.620 --> 1:42:47.060]  nothing to do with 9 11 people smoke right that's right Saudi Arabia once
[1:42:47.060 --> 1:42:50.780]  control all those pipelines correct but it's all about the new Caliphate and the
[1:42:50.780 --> 1:42:54.340]  whole thing you know and oh and Turkey is basically declaring war on Trump
[1:42:54.340 --> 1:42:59.780]  Israel Israel Europe we'll talk about Europe has already banned free speech
[1:42:59.780 --> 1:43:05.420]  and an iron curtain of censorship is sending down over the UK they're set to

[1:48:22.420 --> 1:48:25.740]  know you came here wanting to talk about info wars and what we're doing and
[1:48:25.740 --> 1:48:29.380]  you know all the news but briefly get into what you're doing your ministry the
[1:48:29.380 --> 1:48:32.820]  other books the things that are happening and where you see the world at
[1:48:32.820 --> 1:48:39.460]  this pivotal I guess last reprieve or you were during the break calling it
[1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:42.860]  something else we have a window window window yeah we have a window to turn
[1:48:42.860 --> 1:48:48.020]  this thing around so when my wife and I came here 30 years ago we landed the
[1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:53.540]  country December 1987 landed with $300 didn't hardly know anybody just knew
[1:48:53.540 --> 1:48:57.420]  that I was supposed to come here as a missionary and so it was a long process
[1:48:57.420 --> 1:49:01.380]  for me even to become a United States citizen went through the ringer that's
[1:49:01.380 --> 1:49:05.420]  why I'm against illegals coming across the board it is a right way of coming
[1:49:05.420 --> 1:49:09.180]  and a wrong way of coming and if you come then you adopt the American way of
[1:49:09.180 --> 1:49:13.580]  life period and you adopt the Constitution you do not come here with
[1:49:13.580 --> 1:49:18.300]  subversive ideas of overthrowing a country or diluting the way that this
[1:49:18.300 --> 1:49:23.380]  country is America is America John Wayne Clint Eastwood if you don't like that
[1:49:23.380 --> 1:49:30.900]  head on out baby so I so we came so here we are we arrive in America December
[1:49:30.900 --> 1:49:36.660]  1987 and I traveled just my wife myself three kids in a car in a vehicle
[1:49:36.660 --> 1:49:41.140]  going all across America little churches just you know praying really
[1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:44.860]  trying to find our feet of what we supposed to be doing and then in April
[1:49:44.860 --> 1:49:49.460]  of 89 a revival broke out in Upstate New York that carried us now to 59
[1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:53.340]  countries and it's controversial because if you go back to the first great
[1:49:53.340 --> 1:49:57.180]  awakenings you see what happened where the power of God would overwhelm whole
[1:49:57.180 --> 1:50:01.380]  places and people would be overwhelmed spirit spiritual the enemy can feel it
[1:50:01.380 --> 1:50:06.500]  though and we could feel the revival just understanding information is about
[1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:11.100]  to break out correct so so what happens is because in our meetings we have a lot
[1:50:11.100 --> 1:50:15.140]  of joy which I'm actually a very serious person because I've realized the
[1:50:15.140 --> 1:50:18.780]  battle that we up against but people get filled with joy so we were taxed by the
[1:50:18.780 --> 1:50:24.340]  religious sector people try to block us so Alex I mean 1989 99 no I agree you're
[1:50:24.340 --> 1:50:27.340]  right we've got to be happier about this because at least we're awake it
[1:50:27.340 --> 1:50:30.380]  aren't overtaken by the enemy even though we get upset by the bad stuff
[1:50:30.380 --> 1:50:34.140]  happening we should be really positive that we're at least away and the Bible
[1:50:34.140 --> 1:50:37.860]  says the joy the Lord's our strength plus when the disciples came to Jesus and
[1:50:37.860 --> 1:50:41.860]  they said you know even the devil's a subject to us through you through your
[1:50:41.860 --> 1:50:46.620]  name he Jesus and so that's great I'm so happy to know he said I behold Satan
[1:50:46.620 --> 1:50:50.220]  is lightning fall from heaven he said don't rejoice the devil's a subject to
[1:50:50.220 --> 1:50:53.460]  you but rejoice that your names lit written down the lambs book of life and
[1:50:53.460 --> 1:50:57.420]  you go through many of the church and they said I mean we go to churches one
[1:50:57.420 --> 1:51:01.340]  hour dry cleaning service in by 10 out by 11 I mean you're so happy when it's
[1:51:01.340 --> 1:51:05.060]  finished because it's boring there's no life there's no son but if you hear a
[1:51:05.060 --> 1:51:08.060]  real preacher in the Holy Ghost you don't want to leave exactly in that
[1:51:08.060 --> 1:51:12.940]  effect if we did three three and a half hours sometimes in our conferences which
[1:51:12.940 --> 1:51:17.700]  start the Sunday through Sunday eight days two meetings a day 16 meetings and
[1:51:17.700 --> 1:51:21.300]  the service will go five hours nobody wants to go home I have to tell the
[1:51:21.300 --> 1:51:24.860]  crowd okay the service is over it's finished now you can go home nobody
[1:51:24.860 --> 1:51:29.020]  wants to leave if I don't leave the platform they don't leave so people say
[1:51:29.020 --> 1:51:33.620]  all you people won't do that are you kidding me they go watch movies for
[1:51:33.620 --> 1:51:37.860]  listen I'm not even as as strong as you are before they dial this back on
[1:51:37.860 --> 1:51:42.020]  Facebook Twitter YouTube I could just be calmly talking and it would just build
[1:51:42.020 --> 1:51:45.540]  up like a million watching and they wouldn't go away they'd say don't stop
[1:51:45.540 --> 1:51:49.700]  it there's a hunger for for exposing evil and people people are people are
[1:51:49.700 --> 1:51:53.980]  hungry for the truth and they already know people in the gut know that they're
[1:51:53.980 --> 1:51:58.820]  being sold bill of goods so anyway so when you look at what's taking place we
[1:51:58.820 --> 1:52:03.220]  we have a window so anyway getting back to out what we're doing so we've been
[1:52:03.220 --> 1:52:07.420]  going from church to church with revival trying to revive dead churches get
[1:52:07.420 --> 1:52:11.300]  passes on fire get the people doing what they're trying to ignite the spirit and
[1:52:11.300 --> 1:52:14.500]  yeah because of the Great Commission which is going to all the world and
[1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:18.380]  priests of gospel if we are quiet about it Islam is not quite about what they
[1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:22.660]  doing they're more mosques being built in America they are charging forward
[1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:27.700]  spending all their money buying off the media just they are and 95% of the
[1:52:27.700 --> 1:52:30.740]  American church that's the thing is we're being assaulted and raped by it
[1:52:30.740 --> 1:52:34.460]  because Christians don't blow you up to make you accepted they don't get in your
[1:52:34.460 --> 1:52:37.780]  face they don't boycott you but the Muslims that's what the left loves them
[1:52:37.780 --> 1:52:41.580]  because you add those two groups together or any or all the atheists or all
[1:52:41.580 --> 1:52:45.220]  the other people why are the why are the atheists and liberals and Islam
[1:52:45.220 --> 1:52:52.780]  allied because they hate God they hate God but here's the thing so if 95% of
[1:52:52.780 --> 1:52:56.060]  American church do not tell another person about Jesus they never tell
[1:52:56.060 --> 1:53:00.460]  they never tell 95% of the people sitting in the pews never tell another
[1:53:00.460 --> 1:53:03.740]  person about Jesus but if they see a great movie they tell you go to see this
[1:53:03.740 --> 1:53:08.100]  movie they go to a nice restaurant hey they've taught us to be ashamed totally so
[1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:11.780]  now so they go to church they do their thing and then Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:53:11.780 --> 1:53:14.380]  Thursday Friday Saturday there's nothing what a Christ say he said if you're
[1:53:14.380 --> 1:53:17.300]  ashamed of me I'll be ashamed of you correct and he said going to all the
[1:53:17.300 --> 1:53:20.660]  world and priests of gospel he next effect he said compel the lost and
[1:53:20.660 --> 1:53:25.340]  dying to come in so so what we do is go to church just put the fire of God on
[1:53:25.340 --> 1:53:29.700]  them and then mobilize them doing the day on the streets to go and evangelize
[1:53:29.700 --> 1:53:34.540]  schools universities retirement homes prisons which by the way I've talked to
[1:53:34.540 --> 1:53:38.580]  high-level Google people they are more afraid of anything of real Christians
[1:53:38.580 --> 1:53:43.060]  even jade Helm talks about motivated Christians motivated individuals who then
[1:53:43.060 --> 1:53:46.780]  get on the street because the act of physically in the third dimension
[1:53:46.780 --> 1:53:51.580]  taking action is is is so so frightening to the whole Silicon Valley
[1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:54.900]  because they want to get us into virtual reality and get us out of the real
[1:53:54.900 --> 1:53:59.540]  world and teach us that there's no power in the real world only online as they
[1:53:59.540 --> 1:54:02.900]  even take the power away from being online correct and the big thing is
[1:54:02.900 --> 1:54:07.140]  face-to-face when you meet people and you and you look into the eyes they can
[1:54:07.140 --> 1:54:11.580]  see if this is a real always phony now religious people can do this if they
[1:54:11.580 --> 1:54:16.100]  just religious nobody's gonna follow them but when people come that no that
[1:54:16.100 --> 1:54:19.980]  no Jesus when they come to them and they look in the eyes people sacking well
[1:54:19.980 --> 1:54:23.100]  that's the thing devil worshipers and people in the occult are seeking for
[1:54:23.100 --> 1:54:26.020]  discernment and real knowledge but I'm and I'm not a perfect person but I
[1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:29.540]  have a relationship with God the discernment and the knowledge is like so
[1:54:29.540 --> 1:54:34.260]  powerful they even deal with globalists and they're like slaves compartmentalized
[1:54:34.260 --> 1:54:37.820]  of their one little system of control they're given power by the system but
[1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:41.980]  they have no power no slaves and you actually tune into Christ it's like so
[1:54:41.980 --> 1:54:45.980]  big you're like I can't believe I've got this much power and then the Satanist
[1:54:45.980 --> 1:54:49.420]  have no idea they're searching for power and the power is right there and
[1:54:49.420 --> 1:54:53.660]  what which is what Jesus told the disciples you can read in John 4 he
[1:54:53.660 --> 1:54:57.620]  talked about a well of water spring up to everlasting life John 7 he's talked
[1:54:57.620 --> 1:55:01.100]  about out of your innermost being will flow rivers of living water so he's
[1:55:01.100 --> 1:55:05.300]  talking about the Holy Spirit then Jesus is the one that told the disciples to
[1:55:05.300 --> 1:55:09.460]  go tarry at Jerusalem and he said you would be endured with power you shall
[1:55:09.460 --> 1:55:13.180]  receive power after that the Holy Ghost come upon you and you should be
[1:55:13.180 --> 1:55:17.060]  witnesses under me so it's not so we could sit in the pew or sit in the church
[1:55:17.060 --> 1:55:20.420]  or just have a nice little time no you're getting charged up in the church
[1:55:20.420 --> 1:55:24.700]  with the brethren to go out to go do something and everybody has to do
[1:55:24.700 --> 1:55:28.660]  something every man you don't you don't plug a device into a wall to then have
[1:55:28.660 --> 1:55:32.180]  it sit there you're plugging it into unplug it and do something totally but
[1:55:32.180 --> 1:55:38.060]  by the same devotee thing if we bring an electric appliance in here we plug it
[1:55:38.060 --> 1:55:41.940]  in and switch the switch on so a lot of people are praying for what they already
[1:55:41.940 --> 1:55:45.620]  have they're praying oh God please help us God's already done everything to help
[1:55:45.620 --> 1:55:49.700]  you Jesus went to the cross the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost God
[1:55:49.700 --> 1:55:53.620]  is not dead and I don't have to watch a movie to know that he's not dead he's
[1:55:53.620 --> 1:55:57.220]  not dead I don't have to know I don't have to watch God's not dead one and two
[1:55:57.220 --> 1:56:02.020]  to know he's not dead he's alive and live how can people even deny it when
[1:56:02.020 --> 1:56:06.260]  everything in Revelation is now coming true exactly because the world got
[1:56:06.260 --> 1:56:10.460]  we're gonna cover it next hour but I mean it is it is I really fear for people
[1:56:10.460 --> 1:56:14.540]  that don't have Christ because I get hit with stuff and all I just call on Christ
[1:56:14.540 --> 1:56:17.820]  and then I just have all this strength yeah I'm so sorry people that don't have
[1:56:17.820 --> 1:56:21.140]  this people are not gonna make it with what's coming they're not gonna make it
[1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:24.020]  with what's coming because many people are not prepared they don't know how to
[1:56:24.020 --> 1:56:28.980]  pray if you pray God'll tell you what to do if you pray isn't it amazing if you
[1:56:28.980 --> 1:56:33.300]  if you actually open yourself up it's incredible it's like the advanced
[1:56:33.300 --> 1:56:37.460]  understanding is it makes you humble even when you like when you go to sleep
[1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:40.660]  at night down the next day you have to deal with some major stuff so you say
[1:56:40.660 --> 1:56:43.740]  Lord I'm gonna go to sleep and I pray that when I wake up I'll know exactly
[1:56:43.740 --> 1:56:47.380]  what to do many times I get up in the morning and I know do this do this do
[1:56:47.380 --> 1:56:50.900]  this and it's the most amazing thing because the Holy Spirit's been sent to
[1:56:50.900 --> 1:56:54.820]  help us he's the unseen one people think that the Holy Spirit is a manifest
[1:56:54.820 --> 1:56:58.260]  these devil worshipers are killing little kids so a big demon gets in them
[1:56:58.260 --> 1:57:01.820]  to give them power when the creator of the entire universe is ready to
[1:57:01.820 --> 1:57:04.500]  already give you the real power totally well that's what Hollywood they have to
[1:57:04.500 --> 1:57:08.860]  actually take on spirits to actually act you remember I think was Jack
[1:57:08.860 --> 1:57:16.300]  Nicholson said to the guy that was gonna play the I forget that they admit it
[1:57:16.300 --> 1:57:20.500]  Bob Dylan said no I had to sell my soul to Lucifer but he said the kid that
[1:57:20.500 --> 1:57:23.580]  died when he was playing was in the Batman movie whatever he said don't
[1:57:23.580 --> 1:57:27.940]  don't play that part don't play that it's a dark part he said do do not play
[1:57:27.940 --> 1:57:31.620]  the part well he went and played it and of course he died so the thing is is
[1:57:31.620 --> 1:57:35.500]  people sell their soul to the Lucifer and then he comes to collect them major
[1:57:35.500 --> 1:57:40.260]  singers major actors major people out there that are wanting money they want
[1:57:40.260 --> 1:57:43.980]  fame and fortune so they sell their soul to the devil and then he comes and
[1:57:43.980 --> 1:57:49.260]  takes it they'll be right back guaranteeing your food independence is a

[1:59:48.300 --> 2:00:11.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show info wars dot com is tomorrow's news
[2:00:11.300 --> 2:00:19.180]  today you're listening to the alex jones show here's a fact the big
[2:00:19.180 --> 2:00:22.460]  technocrats say they want full control of your consciousness they're now saying
[2:00:22.460 --> 2:00:25.820]  you're gonna have to die to have your brain uploaded I mean this is such a
[2:00:25.820 --> 2:00:28.900]  con job that you think you're talking to your daddy or mom it's really just a
[2:00:28.900 --> 2:00:33.300]  computer facsimile how for decades they can fake videos they can fake audio now
[2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:36.100]  the politicians are making a big deal out of this because there a lot of them
[2:00:36.100 --> 2:00:38.620]  have been blackmailed they know real videos are coming out so they want to
[2:00:38.620 --> 2:00:42.380]  spend it but it could also could be faked videos because I've had Megan Kelly
[2:00:42.380 --> 2:00:45.620]  when I said Hillary Clinton is responsible for killing children in the
[2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:50.140]  Arab Spring and murdering them by funding it then I showed news articles
[2:00:50.140 --> 2:00:55.140]  she edited the video together made it audio before she left Fox News and had
[2:00:55.140 --> 2:01:00.100]  me saying that they were murdering children in a pizza place to then
[2:01:00.100 --> 2:01:04.580]  discredit larger investigations so they don't need high-tech stuff to do that
[2:01:04.580 --> 2:01:08.900]  they're already deceptively editing you speak to that yeah because it's all
[2:01:08.900 --> 2:01:14.660]  about misinformation disinformation and propaganda so that's how the enemy works
[2:01:14.660 --> 2:01:19.100]  the devil operates through lies lies and lies and then that's what the lies
[2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:24.980]  spread around the world and you see it's put on on on all the mainstream media on
[2:01:24.980 --> 2:01:29.340]  the newspapers they all controlled by the same people folks the operation
[2:01:29.340 --> 2:01:33.260]  mockingbird took over all the media so that's why we sit with the problems that
[2:01:33.260 --> 2:01:37.660]  we sit today because people feed on that stuff and that's what they they believe
[2:01:37.660 --> 2:01:42.820]  and the universities that were taken over standardized of education over a
[2:01:42.820 --> 2:01:48.380]  hundred years ago even of the seminaries so pastors are coming out clueless
[2:01:48.380 --> 2:01:53.300]  students are graduating out of high school clueless unit people graduating
[2:01:53.300 --> 2:01:58.540]  out of university totally ill-equipped have no clue what's going on and it's
[2:01:58.540 --> 2:02:02.420]  spiritual because you can take one of these homified people and actually get
[2:02:02.420 --> 2:02:06.940]  them you connected to God somewhere they awaken and go wow where was I what do you
[2:02:06.940 --> 2:02:11.020]  call that when they're in a delusion like under a spell it's like the God of
[2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:14.780]  this world has blinded the eyes there's no other way that the enemy has
[2:02:14.780 --> 2:02:18.780]  blinded the eyes and they can't see the truth and so they that's the way they
[2:02:18.780 --> 2:02:22.380]  lean where they you know that gives us a being you know we just right wing
[2:02:22.380 --> 2:02:26.340]  conspiracy or whatever no we've actually looked at the facts you know when you
[2:02:26.340 --> 2:02:30.900]  travel 59 countries the world we I see the same scenario repeated in all the
[2:02:30.900 --> 2:02:34.660]  countries that we go to it's just different names different players but
[2:02:34.660 --> 2:02:38.060]  it's the same narrative that's it the devil is very formulaic which is the
[2:02:38.060 --> 2:02:42.100]  strength but also its weakness but it is exactly formulaic well look what he did
[2:02:42.100 --> 2:02:47.300]  to Adam he said if you do I I give you all of this I mean basically came to
[2:02:47.300 --> 2:02:50.840]  Jesus he said if you if you were bowed down before me I give you all the
[2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:54.140]  kingdom of the world Adam was the one that sold everything out to
[2:02:54.140 --> 2:02:58.340]  to Lucifer and so that's when you by the way when I was offered by the biggest
[2:02:58.340 --> 2:03:03.220]  indicator in the country the book deals the Fox deals the 10 million dollars a
[2:03:03.220 --> 2:03:07.100]  year all this stuff and that's 10 million to me not 10 million to fund an
[2:03:07.100 --> 2:03:10.340]  operation and of course it did nothing because I knew it was a sellout as they
[2:03:10.340 --> 2:03:13.820]  said we'll control you it was just like that I was up in a high building and
[2:03:13.820 --> 2:03:18.380]  looking down on on New York and it was just like the devil and then they even
[2:03:18.380 --> 2:03:22.220]  made devil jokes and then Mark Dice got called into Hollywood they wanted to
[2:03:22.220 --> 2:03:26.620]  give a national TV show with one of the guys from Motley Crue and they said but
[2:03:26.620 --> 2:03:29.500]  we just want you to say you denounced Christ he says this is a joke they said
[2:03:29.500 --> 2:03:32.500]  no you got the show you're gonna make a million dollars a year just announced
[2:03:32.500 --> 2:03:35.820]  Jesus right now and Mark went wow this is really real they said yeah no it's
[2:03:35.820 --> 2:03:40.620]  real yeah no I mean I mean they take you up in buildings and tell you it's
[2:03:40.620 --> 2:03:44.660]  blatant it's just like with Christ sure they do the same thing that's what I'm
[2:03:44.660 --> 2:03:49.460]  telling it's like a program it's like there's nothing there it's like a sure
[2:03:49.460 --> 2:03:54.420]  but the bombardment starts with the daycare from my little kids bombarded
[2:03:54.420 --> 2:03:58.300]  in daycare all the way to primary school high school and university so I try to
[2:03:58.300 --> 2:04:02.180]  tell parents teach your own kids do homeschool you know there's programs you
[2:04:02.180 --> 2:04:06.420]  can get where kids will actually well by the time they graduate be way ahead of
[2:04:06.420 --> 2:04:09.180]  any we're gonna talk about solutions are going to break when I but when I told
[2:04:09.180 --> 2:04:11.740]  you that story no Mark Dice has come on and talked about it and he you know he's
[2:04:11.740 --> 2:04:16.020]  had big national shows and stuff they really told him that unbelievable they
[2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:18.620]  wouldn't do that to you have pastors they know I'm telling you with people like
[2:04:18.620 --> 2:04:23.420]  me a long time ago I was like 25 years old they point blank but they didn't say
[2:04:23.420 --> 2:04:25.860]  hey we're devil or spurs but it was like you're up in a big building everyone
[2:04:25.860 --> 2:04:31.300]  you can have all this don't you want it unbelievable I'm saying how weird is that
[2:04:31.300 --> 2:04:34.380]  that they repeat the same thing over and over again sure well it's a it's the
[2:04:34.380 --> 2:04:38.540]  same that's that's why we put this out because it's the same history repeats
[2:04:38.540 --> 2:04:42.300]  itself over and over folks the mark of the beast world government at least a
[2:04:42.300 --> 2:04:46.860]  prototype of it is here prophecy has been fulfilled we're gonna talk about it

[2:07:10.220 --> 2:07:14.380]  because what you're doing is by the way I've watched you for years a decade on
[2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:17.940]  TV listen to you you were taken back when I told you about the Mark dice we've
[2:07:17.940 --> 2:07:21.700]  had him on these clips are real mark die show the media critic I want to know
[2:07:21.700 --> 2:07:25.460]  yeah billions of views what probably billion views he they actually got him
[2:07:25.460 --> 2:07:28.540]  up before he would be given the national TV show and I even know the company he
[2:07:28.540 --> 2:07:31.820]  was involved in because I did some TV stuff they never tell me hey we want you
[2:07:31.820 --> 2:07:35.420]  to reject Jesus or anything but they did with him and I've talked to other
[2:07:35.420 --> 2:07:39.340]  people in Hollywood where they actually asked you to renounce Christ well I
[2:07:39.340 --> 2:07:43.700]  don't doubt that for one second so that's the attack that's that's the whole
[2:07:43.700 --> 2:07:48.060]  attack so I feel that we have a last-minute reprieve Alex I really
[2:07:48.060 --> 2:07:53.620]  feel that I you know 2008 was a real critical year for us before you know we
[2:07:53.620 --> 2:07:58.220]  were just looking at where America was headed and I was I was actually speaking
[2:07:58.220 --> 2:08:03.740]  in in Phoenix Arizona and on a Monday night as I was preaching I just began to
[2:08:03.740 --> 2:08:07.660]  speak this outcome right out of my spirit and I said it was really talking
[2:08:07.660 --> 2:08:11.260]  to the church is like I heard the Lord say tell the church to speak to the Sun
[2:08:11.260 --> 2:08:16.380]  and tell the Sun no you can't set just yet but the Sun is fast-setting on the
[2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:20.340]  horizon of time but it's just like Josh should come on the Sun the moon to stand
[2:08:20.340 --> 2:08:25.260]  still and the Lord gave him one more day the Lord said I will give you one more
[2:08:25.260 --> 2:08:29.300]  hour one more hour of daylight so I kind of figured okay what's an hour of
[2:08:29.300 --> 2:08:33.420]  daylight if a thousand years a day days a thousand years there'll be 40 years so
[2:08:33.420 --> 2:08:37.340]  I said okay great that'll put me into my late 80s and we could smack this thing
[2:08:37.340 --> 2:08:40.340]  up the side of the head and we and that's the hour because here's the thing
[2:08:40.340 --> 2:08:44.580]  a hundred years from now we'll be in heaven you and me and then we look at
[2:08:44.580 --> 2:08:49.300]  each other and we think did we play the fool with our life on the earth was
[2:08:49.300 --> 2:08:52.760]  there more that we could have done could we have well that's the feeling I
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:57.780]  constantly have is not that I big enough for a good man or any of this I feel
[2:08:57.780 --> 2:09:02.260]  like with all I've got I should be doing more and I'm constantly frustrated and
[2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:06.620]  then in my gut God just says look just trusting God be good be strong tell the
[2:09:06.620 --> 2:09:09.660]  truth it's all that I'll never that'll never go away because it's all that's
[2:09:09.660 --> 2:09:13.100]  the thing that causes you to reach out so that will never go away so being
[2:09:13.100 --> 2:09:16.700]  encouraged about that because I deal with the exact same thing so I mean when
[2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:21.260]  when we give me midnight I thought I've done enough oh yeah so we know it's
[2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:26.780]  like this evil is coming 2007 8 and 9 we went to 55 cities across America and
[2:09:26.780 --> 2:09:31.100]  saw 1.1 million people give their lives to the Lord that's in schools retirement
[2:09:31.100 --> 2:09:34.540]  homes we went to all the retirement homes where people were dying left by the
[2:09:34.540 --> 2:09:38.260]  families and people were confessing Jesus and praying with us some of the
[2:09:38.260 --> 2:09:43.700]  ladies they actually prayed people prayed and then lost words were thank
[2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:47.620]  you Jesus for saving me and they died they died right as they prayed the
[2:09:47.620 --> 2:09:50.820]  prayer and you know they were probably waiting for that they were well here's
[2:09:50.820 --> 2:09:54.580]  one classic example they want my dad's mom my mom she was a Christian but she
[2:09:54.580 --> 2:09:57.740]  waited till my dad got her to die she's like oh you're here died what what
[2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:01.900]  happened one of our people that we trained went into a retirement home this
[2:10:01.900 --> 2:10:06.140]  lady 83 years of age she's sitting curled up at a fetal position and Alex
[2:10:06.140 --> 2:10:10.980]  no family nobody no food she's only given water she's dying and she's
[2:10:10.980 --> 2:10:17.700]  groaning and one of our people shook her away if she looked right up in the
[2:10:17.700 --> 2:10:23.340]  eye of she didn't know who it was and she said my soul is lost so she knew she
[2:10:23.340 --> 2:10:26.900]  was dying and there was nobody there to to pray with her before she died and they
[2:10:26.900 --> 2:10:31.420]  prayed with her right there led her to Christ immediately they went down to the
[2:10:31.420 --> 2:10:36.220]  next room 20 miss later they went by and there was a sheath coming this lady
[2:10:36.220 --> 2:10:42.860]  they plucked her right out the jaws of hell and so we the church the church
[2:10:42.860 --> 2:10:47.460]  that's powerful that's like right on the cross it was amazing amazing the church
[2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:50.500]  things that we got to wait for everybody that brings to the minds to think
[2:10:50.500 --> 2:10:55.060]  about how people warehouse their parents and then they die alone and then these
[2:10:55.060 --> 2:10:58.380]  people don't think they're not gonna die like that I mean right there that's a
[2:10:58.380 --> 2:11:01.540]  test right there if you'll take care of your parents no we've got to reach we've
[2:11:01.540 --> 2:11:05.580]  got to win the loss Alex you know the Bible says he who wins souls is wise
[2:11:05.580 --> 2:11:10.260]  John 3 16 for God's so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that
[2:11:10.260 --> 2:11:13.980]  whosoever believes in him should not perish but ever lost in life and then
[2:11:13.980 --> 2:11:17.420]  the Bible says God did not send his son the world to condemn the world so God's
[2:11:17.420 --> 2:11:22.780]  not against anybody he loves everybody and but he wants people to know that the
[2:11:22.780 --> 2:11:27.260]  price was paid on Calvary Jesus did it all and by the way we know because the
[2:11:27.260 --> 2:11:31.580]  whole wicked anti-human system that dumps people down that sterilizes that
[2:11:31.580 --> 2:11:35.420]  poisons the earth everything out of it is evil nothing good it hates Christ
[2:11:35.420 --> 2:11:39.500]  doesn't hate the fake church is that's the counterfeit he hates Christ that's
[2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:44.420]  the antichrist antichrist spirit is anything that's antichrist which he
[2:11:44.420 --> 2:11:49.340]  came to give life you look at Hollywood Bezos all of it it's totally antichrist
[2:11:49.340 --> 2:11:53.620]  totally we're gonna go to break a few but four minutes what you see on the
[2:11:53.620 --> 2:11:56.940]  floor but that here's my thing about that powerful story but I want you to
[2:11:56.940 --> 2:12:06.260]  specifically speak to just it I mean like time frames reprieve so people
[2:12:06.260 --> 2:12:09.300]  understand this because so many Christians think they're just dead and
[2:12:09.300 --> 2:12:13.060]  they don't have any power to change some timeline and but you look at Nineveh and
[2:12:13.060 --> 2:12:16.980]  other cases of the Bible and history of big reprieves so that there can be a
[2:12:16.980 --> 2:12:20.660]  bigger plan other things can happen and as I think we say a window you mean like
[2:12:20.660 --> 2:12:26.100]  a Nineveh reprieve correct so like you take Jonah so yes Jonah God tells me to
[2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:30.500]  go to Nineveh and he doesn't want to go so what he's he takes a cruise so he's
[2:12:30.500 --> 2:12:36.700]  sitting on this boat eating seafood then all hell breaks loose and guess who gets
[2:12:36.700 --> 2:12:41.460]  thrown overboard Jonah now he becomes seafood so this fish swallows him up
[2:12:41.460 --> 2:12:46.020]  now he's inside the belly of the fish now he's got to do some praying wouldn't
[2:12:46.020 --> 2:12:49.100]  you pray if you win a belly of fish I'd be praying you know what I mean because
[2:12:49.100 --> 2:12:53.180]  you know the way out is not the way you came in think about the process of being
[2:12:53.180 --> 2:12:58.740]  in a digestive system of a fish so he's there for three days he prays he cries
[2:12:58.740 --> 2:13:03.780]  out and the fish thankfully vomits him out so no wonder when Jonah went to
[2:13:03.780 --> 2:13:06.820]  Nineveh and said repent they're all repented said look at this guy it looks
[2:13:06.820 --> 2:13:10.660]  like crap you know what I mean so they're all repented and the whole the whole of
[2:13:10.660 --> 2:13:15.620]  Nineveh turned because Jonah went to go and obey God ultimately but he went to
[2:13:15.620 --> 2:13:19.220]  the belly of a fish God doesn't want you to go through a belly of fish he just
[2:13:19.220 --> 2:13:22.940]  wants you to obey he has a thing not everybody's gonna stand in the church
[2:13:22.940 --> 2:13:26.900]  and preach like to do what I do but everybody should be vocal you got to
[2:13:26.900 --> 2:13:30.260]  use and don't come tell me that you don't you shine embarrassed I'll take
[2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:33.500]  your cell phone and we'll see your collective talk time on your cell phone
[2:13:33.500 --> 2:13:36.940]  and I'll show you that you are not shine embarrassed talk about the things
[2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:41.700]  that are important to you you have to get radical it's time for Americans to
[2:13:41.700 --> 2:13:45.940]  stand up you can't leave this to a Sunday morning one hour thing on a
[2:13:45.940 --> 2:13:49.100]  that's the thing is we've got this whole global government program but the one
[2:13:49.100 --> 2:13:52.260]  thing it doesn't want you to be as Christian and speaking out and and
[2:13:52.260 --> 2:13:56.260]  talking to other people once you just shut up and talk about Netflix and talk
[2:13:56.260 --> 2:13:59.460]  about all this stuff but all of that is killing us totally because it's
[2:13:59.460 --> 2:14:03.540]  distracting from the main point the fact is a matter that what would happen if
[2:14:03.540 --> 2:14:08.020]  you watching the program right now but tonight listen to me you put your head
[2:14:08.020 --> 2:14:11.380]  on your pillow and the minute of the night you fall asleep and never wake up
[2:14:11.380 --> 2:14:16.300]  where you're gonna go somebody said well I don't believe in that well that's fine
[2:14:16.300 --> 2:14:19.460]  but you know what you don't want to be on the other side of that and then find
[2:14:19.460 --> 2:14:23.220]  out that you heard me talk along these lines and that you never but if you
[2:14:23.220 --> 2:14:27.260]  study the globalist they're obsessed with energy and spirits and the
[2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:31.300]  dimensions and that they they're caught in this evil thing they don't want us
[2:14:31.300 --> 2:14:36.060]  to go up to God they want to go down to them and they're trying to become God
[2:14:36.060 --> 2:14:39.980]  it's like the time they're trying to build here on earth exactly they're
[2:14:39.980 --> 2:14:43.460]  trying to take genetics and saying I don't believe in God yet I'm gonna be
[2:14:43.460 --> 2:14:47.460]  God's like a town of Babel and why do the globalist all say we have to have
[2:14:47.460 --> 2:14:51.260]  world government and exterminate humanity and then the AI machines will
[2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:54.420]  let us merge with them and even Elon Musk says he meets with all these
[2:14:54.420 --> 2:14:58.660]  billionaires they all go I worship the spirit and it will be in the computer and
[2:14:58.660 --> 2:15:02.620]  I will merge and everyone else will die and he's like what kind of culture you
[2:15:02.620 --> 2:15:06.300]  and why are you all saying we're gonna kill everybody because there's some
[2:15:06.300 --> 2:15:10.860]  satanic interdimensional force whatever you want to call it Satan pushing through
[2:15:10.860 --> 2:15:14.220]  doing this yeah well you can just go to the Georgia guardstones what's
[2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:18.060]  erected right outside of Atlanta the whole plan to reduce had paid for by
[2:15:18.060 --> 2:15:22.740]  Ted Turner reduce the world's population to 500 million people because they feel
[2:15:22.740 --> 2:15:25.740]  like the world's over popularly which you know that the scientists said that we
[2:15:25.740 --> 2:15:29.300]  could have 10 billion people on the planet put them all in Texas but no but
[2:15:29.300 --> 2:15:31.980]  we could have 10 billion people on the planet and would never get more than
[2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:35.260]  that just by death and birth it would stay at that well it's already gonna
[2:15:35.260 --> 2:15:38.460]  peak out the thing about 9 billion yeah but God never put the earth here to run
[2:15:38.460 --> 2:15:42.700]  out of anything never and then the Bible says as long as the earth remains

[2:20:53.340 --> 2:20:59.100]  info wars.com and pastor Rodney Howard Brown is here with us during a four
[2:20:59.100 --> 2:21:04.780]  minute break last hour you just really laid out the mark of the beast system
[2:21:04.780 --> 2:21:08.900]  and how the precursor is already here like no one else I've seen and even if
[2:21:08.900 --> 2:21:14.220]  people don't believe in God this system of control imagine what a Stalin or a
[2:21:14.220 --> 2:21:17.940]  Hitler would have done with this and how they're already using the digital
[2:21:17.940 --> 2:21:21.780]  control and already harassing nationalist and Christians and patriots
[2:21:21.780 --> 2:21:27.540]  and persecuting the church all of it so lay that out for people okay so he is a
[2:21:27.540 --> 2:21:32.260]  thing I mean obviously everything's about buying and selling you you take the
[2:21:32.260 --> 2:21:37.100]  Bible says the book of Ezekiel 28 talking about Lucifer said you were this
[2:21:37.100 --> 2:21:42.420]  son of the morning he says you were perfect in every way till iniquity was
[2:21:42.420 --> 2:21:46.820]  founded you and by the multitude your merchandise and iniquity of your traffic
[2:21:46.820 --> 2:21:50.860]  so obviously he was doing something in heaven and when he fell he took the third
[2:21:50.860 --> 2:21:56.460]  of the angels with him so number one politician is Lucifer and he knows how
[2:21:56.460 --> 2:21:59.660]  everything to do with trade it's all that's why the Bible says the love of
[2:21:59.660 --> 2:22:03.820]  money is the root of all evil so when he was thrown onto the earth yes Adam who's
[2:22:03.820 --> 2:22:08.700]  actually in charge of the whole planet sells it doesn't know it no names all
[2:22:08.700 --> 2:22:12.460]  the animals I mean you mentioned the brain to name all the animals Alex
[2:22:12.460 --> 2:22:17.740]  unbelievable and so perfect in his generations in everything and could
[2:22:17.740 --> 2:22:22.740]  commune with God and then he Adam loses everything and so here the devils in
[2:22:22.740 --> 2:22:26.060]  control what are the two areas that we are told as Christians we have to stay
[2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:29.820]  away from money we shouldn't have any money we should be put which is a total
[2:22:29.820 --> 2:22:34.020]  lie if you read the Bible it doesn't we're given dominion over the whole planet
[2:22:34.020 --> 2:22:38.820]  it's all devilish tricks totally and the other area is government we but but
[2:22:38.820 --> 2:22:42.100]  Jesus is gonna set up government ultimately we're gonna rule and reign
[2:22:42.100 --> 2:22:46.620]  with him so we might as well practice down here so the fact of the matter is
[2:22:46.620 --> 2:22:50.500]  this that people don't they trick us into giving up our birthright totally and
[2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:54.900]  then the Christians are just shut down in the church on a Sunday and you need
[2:22:54.900 --> 2:22:59.780]  to be you need to be quiet you shut up don't make a noise absolutely not I can't
[2:22:59.780 --> 2:23:03.220]  preach on a Sunday when you killing my people Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[2:23:03.220 --> 2:23:07.140]  Friday Saturday and I'm not gonna promise my people it's gonna be okay just
[2:23:07.140 --> 2:23:11.940]  because we read the Bible and we pray I tell you we read the Bible we pray and
[2:23:11.940 --> 2:23:15.620]  God tells us to go do something it's time for everybody to get up and kick
[2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:19.140]  butt and take names it's time for people to get serious with what they believe
[2:23:19.140 --> 2:23:23.260]  Stephen was stoned to death I don't want to get to heaven and then after tap
[2:23:23.260 --> 2:23:27.260]  Stephen on the shoulder and say you my hero because you love Jesus more than
[2:23:27.260 --> 2:23:30.820]  me and I was a chicken no I agree we should be on the March but so people
[2:23:30.820 --> 2:23:35.300]  understand our children the smartphones the social media is making him
[2:23:35.300 --> 2:23:39.660]  depressed everything that's deployed the cancer rates were falling apart you
[2:23:39.660 --> 2:23:42.780]  talk about China and its whole system in India get into the market the beast
[2:23:42.780 --> 2:23:46.820]  because this proves it's all real so everything's coming to this this buying
[2:23:46.820 --> 2:23:51.420]  and selling which has to do with your power your ability to buy so if they
[2:23:51.420 --> 2:23:55.180]  start removing cash people don't know the seven but there's only seven percent
[2:23:55.180 --> 2:23:58.540]  of cash in circulation in America remember the one-time Christ beat people
[2:23:58.540 --> 2:24:02.260]  the money changers they'd make you buy a special coin to buy your sacrifice and
[2:24:02.260 --> 2:24:05.340]  they manipulated it made you pay ten times what it was a war through scarcity
[2:24:05.340 --> 2:24:09.380]  so it's showing they through commerce they make commerce your God and get
[2:24:09.380 --> 2:24:14.420]  between you and God and then rip you off totally so Christ is like merchants
[2:24:14.420 --> 2:24:18.820]  ripping people off gets you mad that's why he flipped over the money change he
[2:24:18.820 --> 2:24:23.420]  actually Jesus actually beat the central bankers of the day so he is what in
[2:24:23.420 --> 2:24:27.460]  England there's only four percent of cash in circulation so that's why they
[2:24:27.460 --> 2:24:32.020]  want to go to a total cashless society and then basically control you monitor
[2:24:32.020 --> 2:24:35.860]  you through your social media where you are what you're eating through your
[2:24:35.860 --> 2:24:40.660]  purchases everything and so basically you know people say people say well I'll
[2:24:40.660 --> 2:24:43.660]  move to another country I've got news for you they'll watch you in another
[2:24:43.660 --> 2:24:47.900]  country I've got friends in Australia on the big cattle stations and he told me I
[2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:53.580]  mean I'm talking about with the 40,000 head of cattle I'm talking about a hundred
[2:24:53.580 --> 2:24:58.500]  acres a million acres that's a huge the father and sons leave the house and they
[2:24:58.500 --> 2:25:01.540]  don't get home for three months and they're only on their property can you
[2:25:01.540 --> 2:25:04.820]  imagine that that's how big the property is so they said if we built
[2:25:04.820 --> 2:25:08.180]  something on here we get a call from the government what are you doing well you
[2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:11.540]  know I'm doing something I'm like 20 hours by car from anywhere they're
[2:25:11.540 --> 2:25:16.220]  watching my satellite so guess what you can run but you can hide it don't matter
[2:25:16.220 --> 2:25:20.300]  where you are you get tracked I've already taken talk to people and you
[2:25:20.300 --> 2:25:23.260]  call it the news tightening what you said during that four minute break was you
[2:25:23.260 --> 2:25:26.780]  have the news is tightening basically to where you won't be able to move do
[2:25:26.780 --> 2:25:30.340]  anything because your cell phones on they contract wherever you are what you're
[2:25:30.340 --> 2:25:33.940]  doing they listen to you in your home with your with your television off they
[2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:37.340]  can watch you in your home they can listen to you on your device they can
[2:25:37.340 --> 2:25:40.620]  switch your cameras on they can record everything I mean basically we in a
[2:25:40.620 --> 2:25:47.740]  surveillance state it's 1984 and it's ubiquitous yeah so my wife was saying
[2:25:47.740 --> 2:25:51.460]  the other day she mentioned something my wife said she mentioned something and
[2:25:51.460 --> 2:25:55.100]  then she went to search for it and it popped right up in a search she said my
[2:25:55.100 --> 2:25:58.740]  phones list oh they admit that that was the patent 12 years ago and now they're
[2:25:58.740 --> 2:26:02.700]  doing it so we made the joke secretly here we would go talk about weird archaic
[2:26:02.700 --> 2:26:06.660]  stuff and a few hours later it was popping up I mean it is just what they've
[2:26:06.660 --> 2:26:11.460]  done is so diabolical so basically I'll send it to India yeah so basically so
[2:26:11.460 --> 2:26:15.340]  and he already has a national ID to buy and sell so China has their you're
[2:26:15.340 --> 2:26:19.220]  getting into it China is also working on that whole thing with with the national
[2:26:19.220 --> 2:26:24.580]  ID plus they're putting a social score to people that if you don't meet the
[2:26:24.580 --> 2:26:28.420]  social score they want to let you get on an airplane you might never be able to
[2:26:28.420 --> 2:26:32.420]  start happening to journalists so there it is buy nor sell can't travel can't live
[2:26:32.420 --> 2:26:36.860]  your put an electronic go log I mean this is this is this is here it's not
[2:26:36.860 --> 2:26:41.460]  coming no it's right here so here's the thing we have a window and if the church
[2:26:41.460 --> 2:26:45.700]  doesn't wake up I'm talking about good people all that has to happen for evil
[2:26:45.700 --> 2:26:49.460]  to prevail is for good people to do absolutely nothing so when good people
[2:26:49.460 --> 2:26:54.420]  get up and here's the thing ask God what does he want you to do everybody can
[2:26:54.420 --> 2:26:58.460]  make a difference come on you don't have to do what I do or what Alex does but
[2:26:58.460 --> 2:27:02.660]  you need to do it and then those of you that are watching Alex right now you
[2:27:02.660 --> 2:27:06.580]  know some of you have received so much information it's time for you to do
[2:27:06.580 --> 2:27:09.540]  something back and by the way they all know that they're awesome but they're
[2:27:09.540 --> 2:27:13.980]  so humble and I'm just because they expect after this big huge thing no tell
[2:27:13.980 --> 2:27:17.740]  people about the website about what you're doing or people need to support
[2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:22.180]  you financially you know companies Nick their companies out there Patriots you
[2:27:22.180 --> 2:27:26.340]  need to send something monthly say Alex here's a thousand dollars to help with
[2:27:26.340 --> 2:27:30.380]  the info war it's imperative that you get behind because let me tell you the
[2:27:30.380 --> 2:27:34.020]  liberal all those in the liberal agenda they're all given money they're getting
[2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:37.540]  pumped millions of dollars Muslims reportedly give like a third of what
[2:27:37.540 --> 2:27:41.700]  they do to charity but it's not charity it's the big combines it's totally to
[2:27:41.700 --> 2:27:45.980]  indoctrinate people so it's an imperative if I can why won't Christians give like
[2:27:45.980 --> 2:27:50.440]  the Muslims because you know they've been told just go to
[2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:53.980]  Skilford church for an hour and you're done it's not that you know everything's
[2:27:53.980 --> 2:27:57.460]  been attested I and I'll tell you what you know because I deal with it I teach
[2:27:57.460 --> 2:28:00.700]  people how to get blessed because I believe in prosperity I mean there's
[2:28:00.700 --> 2:28:04.540]  people that can go excessive in anything beyond in a gut level it's not just the
[2:28:04.540 --> 2:28:08.140]  giving it's the committing yeah but I mean that is the committee but I'm
[2:28:08.140 --> 2:28:11.940]  saying isn't it just the willing to be good because people think what they have
[2:28:11.940 --> 2:28:15.260]  is theirs they don't understand that they stewards of what they have so they
[2:28:15.260 --> 2:28:18.660]  think look at my money this is all my money it's actually not everything you
[2:28:18.660 --> 2:28:22.380]  have comes from God when a baby's born it's not born with a briefcase with
[2:28:22.380 --> 2:28:26.100]  special documents giving at wealth it comes out with nothing and when you
[2:28:26.100 --> 2:28:30.340]  leave the earth you leave with nothing so we are supposed to say don't they get
[2:28:30.340 --> 2:28:35.100]  they have to parlay the success that their ancestors gave them they have to
[2:28:35.100 --> 2:28:38.700]  continue that on now or they're gonna lose it off and I think it's the parents
[2:28:38.700 --> 2:28:43.100]  job to teach the children the obligation back to help support the gospel of
[2:28:43.100 --> 2:28:46.220]  Christ and even people that are watching this say listen we need to get
[2:28:46.220 --> 2:28:48.900]  behind Alex well let's talk about when we come back it's like I'm gonna talk

[2:32:12.380 --> 2:32:16.420]  or two behind what's happening in the UK CNN and many others are calling for

[2:32:21.180 --> 2:32:26.180]  others saying go beyond censorship brainwash young people against info
[2:32:26.180 --> 2:32:30.820]  wars psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually have to
[2:32:30.820 --> 2:32:35.540]  say we are the most hated news source in the world by globalist it is so
[2:32:35.540 --> 2:32:40.180]  critical that you go to info wars.com or slash newsletter and sign up for the

[2:32:53.580 --> 2:32:56.060]  know you will
[2:32:56.060 --> 2:33:03.460]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:03.460 --> 2:33:22.660]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:34.460 --> 2:33:39.820]  Rodney Howard Brown's our guest amazing in studio I always enjoy watching him on
[2:33:39.820 --> 2:33:43.980]  the internet television I wanted to get into what's happened in South Africa as
[2:33:43.980 --> 2:33:48.940]  the model of their control but the Senate Intelligence Committee they said
[2:33:48.940 --> 2:33:52.740]  this last night but now it's official has found Russian meddling on the side of
[2:33:52.740 --> 2:33:56.660]  Trump well of course you can find bots that somebody bought in Russia to
[2:33:56.660 --> 2:34:00.460]  influence every country was involved like you said earlier pastor Ukraine
[2:34:00.460 --> 2:34:04.180]  admittedly was on the side of Hillary but this claim that Americans didn't elect
[2:34:04.180 --> 2:34:09.460]  Trump they just keep beating this drum which is ridiculous I mean Russia had
[2:34:09.460 --> 2:34:13.420]  nothing to do with me going to the ballot box and the same with all the
[2:34:13.420 --> 2:34:19.420]  patriots across the United States so this is all just an attack that the left
[2:34:19.420 --> 2:34:24.980]  is cannot get over the fact that they didn't get the candidate in and that
[2:34:24.980 --> 2:34:27.940]  they got somebody in there who's actually ready and I agree so as
[2:34:27.940 --> 2:34:31.620]  everything they do fails and as Trump turns the country around what are they
[2:34:31.620 --> 2:34:35.860]  going to do well it's gonna get worse I think we're gonna just see crazy things
[2:34:35.860 --> 2:34:41.060]  happen you know it's just you've seen people act out of the ordinary people
[2:34:41.060 --> 2:34:45.500]  going they're going to the instigate to try to stop it's like a whole bunch of
[2:34:45.500 --> 2:34:49.420]  kids look at them like you talked about the lady taking a dump in a coffee shop
[2:34:49.420 --> 2:34:54.060]  yesterday so it says we're just gonna expect to see more by the way insanity
[2:34:54.060 --> 2:34:59.380]  mental illness bizarre behavior is in every level way up in Western countries
[2:34:59.380 --> 2:35:03.740]  what is it what's happening it's gone it's gone to the umpteenth level you know
[2:35:03.740 --> 2:35:08.460]  I think we've got a lot of people on all kinds of drugs I mean you see what's
[2:35:08.460 --> 2:35:14.220]  taking place even with the medical profession I mean you know as well as I
[2:35:14.220 --> 2:35:19.660]  do that there many many people are dying from mouth practice things that take
[2:35:19.660 --> 2:35:24.260]  place even in the hospital you know so which you know I know doctors are trying
[2:35:24.260 --> 2:35:28.060]  to help people but the whole of medical science has changed system your book
[2:35:28.060 --> 2:35:31.460]  breaks down how the Rockefeller's on record to control of it correct of the
[2:35:31.460 --> 2:35:35.980]  American Medical Association so this is so important that people realize you
[2:35:35.980 --> 2:35:39.020]  know and again let me just say this I want to I want to say this on air I
[2:35:39.020 --> 2:35:43.740]  feel that you're gonna have and what are unveiled here in the next year will be a
[2:35:43.740 --> 2:35:47.500]  24-hour news network they'll be around the clock and you'll have different
[2:35:47.500 --> 2:35:51.900]  people that will report plus you're gonna have reporters around the world in
[2:35:51.900 --> 2:35:55.260]  the countries of the world there will be info warriors that will report they'll
[2:35:55.260 --> 2:35:59.260]  do it as their hobby and so daily uploaded the info wars you're gonna be
[2:35:59.260 --> 2:36:02.340]  getting all these headlines that have come and they've not come through the
[2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:07.940]  mainstream media AP you know Roy it is it's gonna come straight to info wars and
[2:36:07.940 --> 2:36:12.700]  I just see this is a new I like that because almost like they're accredited
[2:36:12.700 --> 2:36:16.380]  we approve them but they upload we know who they are it's there we put in the
[2:36:16.380 --> 2:36:21.340]  live feed that's pretty much what I've been trying to envision so in your mind
[2:36:21.340 --> 2:36:24.300]  desire your spirit what did you see pastor I just feel that's what you're
[2:36:24.300 --> 2:36:28.860]  gonna end up with you and I feel that's why I said earlier there's people out
[2:36:28.860 --> 2:36:33.100]  there there's people watching Alex that you have the means I'm not tanked to
[2:36:33.100 --> 2:36:36.300]  throw a hundred dollars you have the means to come and bring millions of
[2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:40.260]  dollars to the table and you need to do it for the sake of America and for the
[2:36:40.260 --> 2:36:43.740]  sake of the nations of the earth well I was about to say I know just in Texas
[2:36:43.740 --> 2:36:46.220]  the amount of money there is and I've never even really gone out and tried to
[2:36:46.220 --> 2:36:49.340]  get it myself I've had to sell fun but as they try to shut us down it becomes
[2:36:49.340 --> 2:36:53.020]  harder and all these people know what's going on but they think if they hoard more
[2:36:53.020 --> 2:36:56.700]  of the money that somehow they're going to win they're gonna lose it all yeah
[2:36:56.700 --> 2:37:01.340]  because they could collapse the they could shut down the dollar tomorrow we
[2:37:01.340 --> 2:37:06.660]  could they could collapse Wall Street next Monday and it's over or the only
[2:37:06.660 --> 2:37:10.900]  real value is what you do spiritually politically you can say real estate as
[2:37:10.900 --> 2:37:14.660]  well but they could try to take that I mean so many Christians and conservatives
[2:37:14.660 --> 2:37:20.140]  shit on the fence they think that's safe in the spirit of stagnant behavior but
[2:37:20.140 --> 2:37:23.860]  now you can see we're going over the waterfall we're entering a big time of
[2:37:23.860 --> 2:37:28.060]  change totally so I want to just say this again you watching a you have a
[2:37:28.060 --> 2:37:32.540]  company you have a corporation and you are successful give behind the info
[2:37:32.540 --> 2:37:36.620]  wars you've you've received from Alex for years you know you awake so we don't
[2:37:36.620 --> 2:37:40.340]  have to wake you but take your money put your money where your mouth is and say
[2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:44.260]  Alex say well let's help pay for all what you need in your studio let's help
[2:37:44.260 --> 2:37:48.340]  underwrite the satellite times of what you need to take this thing global it's
[2:37:48.340 --> 2:37:52.420]  help you build a whole network of the information and I'll say this and we got
[2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:56.260]  big donations that were earmarked I would a hundred percent go to satellite one
[2:37:56.260 --> 2:38:00.620]  satellite all of Africa Middle East satellite Europe Russia satellite you
[2:38:00.620 --> 2:38:05.660]  know Japan that whole area down through Asia South Pacific five six satellites
[2:38:05.660 --> 2:38:10.100]  more we cover the whole planet I do got to right now covering but I do have
[2:38:10.100 --> 2:38:13.820]  contact with all those people all the satellite companies so I know all the
[2:38:13.820 --> 2:38:17.740]  thing I can help you that they won't gouge you because if you well I know we
[2:38:17.740 --> 2:38:21.340]  got gouged a few years ago and the satellite was so high-tech the companies
[2:38:21.340 --> 2:38:25.460]  wouldn't even decode it on the ground if you if you let an agency do it for you
[2:38:25.460 --> 2:38:29.340]  the agency is doing and they're not gonna cut the price down to get you a deal I
[2:38:29.340 --> 2:38:33.500]  know we're gonna hide so they can get a greater commission so let me help you
[2:38:33.500 --> 2:38:38.340]  with that I know all these people that's another problem the left loves to be in
[2:38:38.340 --> 2:38:41.780]  control they don't do anything of the tech of the companies and as you said
[2:38:41.780 --> 2:38:45.020]  I you thank you for your help this is a break appreciate you reaching out to us
[2:38:45.020 --> 2:38:47.900]  to help us because I admire the work of them but the fact that you know all this
[2:38:47.900 --> 2:38:51.740]  I've been through that where the left is in these companies and they sabotage you
[2:38:51.740 --> 2:38:58.020]  through what they do totally well it it comes through lawyers CPAs all of this
[2:38:58.020 --> 2:39:01.980]  stuff I can write a book on it yeah I can write a book on all the corruption and
[2:39:01.980 --> 2:39:05.580]  I'm just talking about from the church standpoint these Christian attorneys and
[2:39:05.580 --> 2:39:08.500]  Christian CPAs are gonna help me meet while they're setting you up for trouble
[2:39:08.500 --> 2:39:12.940]  so that they can make money defending you at a later time and they always act
[2:39:12.940 --> 2:39:17.500]  like you're stupid you don't know what you're doing but I we're not stupid
[2:39:17.500 --> 2:39:20.700]  because you have a youth you know in your spirit you know something's wrong
[2:39:20.700 --> 2:39:24.860]  here so that's what the I always work off of what my heart is telling me so I'm
[2:39:24.860 --> 2:39:27.820]  not gonna you know I'm not gonna just believe what they say because all of
[2:39:27.820 --> 2:39:30.820]  that the point is we're not just on air people think oh they're on air fighting
[2:39:30.820 --> 2:39:35.100]  the snow the whole system wants to shut this down to shut your voices up totally
[2:39:35.100 --> 2:39:39.700]  so but you've got information through books through through films all your
[2:39:39.700 --> 2:39:43.900]  films Alex people watch those things all the time I need to make more films yeah
[2:39:43.900 --> 2:39:48.860]  just we get but now it does seem like a big film a big event they have trouble
[2:39:48.860 --> 2:39:51.780]  censoring but the constant news we put out they're trying to block it let me
[2:39:51.780 --> 2:39:55.540]  ask you this because I've been asking one of the questions pastor brown gut
[2:39:55.540 --> 2:40:01.140]  level in the in the you know age of the earth and in God's plan talk about a
[2:40:01.140 --> 2:40:05.420]  reprieve just in your mind's eye no you don't want to say exactly because you
[2:40:05.420 --> 2:40:08.660]  don't want to be up there like you have all the answers but at a spiritual
[2:40:08.660 --> 2:40:12.900]  level a sermon level how long's the planet got left I mean I know we have it
[2:40:12.900 --> 2:40:16.340]  from a Christian perspective from the Bible which I think is 100% accurate but
[2:40:16.340 --> 2:40:20.700]  in a modern context the devil I mean it sounds like some interdimensional
[2:40:20.700 --> 2:40:24.780]  creature here trying to enslave us and God gave us creation in life and God's
[2:40:24.780 --> 2:40:28.660]  trying to warn us but we have free will so this con artist wants to you know
[2:40:28.660 --> 2:40:32.140]  trick us into getting the white truck with him the white van God will let us
[2:40:32.140 --> 2:40:37.380]  do that I'm not saying God to say this I totally get God's spirit but free will
[2:40:37.380 --> 2:40:43.180]  man I mean I guess God is he's waiting on us he's actually waiting on us Jesus
[2:40:43.180 --> 2:40:47.020]  said when I come back will I find faith on the earth so he's waiting on us in
[2:40:47.020 --> 2:40:50.900]  every generation down through the centuries there'd be men and women that
[2:40:50.900 --> 2:40:54.780]  stood up will be forced and others that made a difference for their generation

[2:43:00.980 --> 2:43:05.460]  an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[2:43:05.460 --> 2:43:10.580]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[2:43:10.580 --> 2:43:16.220]  respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people
[2:43:16.220 --> 2:43:20.620]  who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[2:43:20.620 --> 2:43:25.100]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades
[2:43:25.100 --> 2:43:29.740]  later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet

[2:46:58.820 --> 2:47:04.340]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:47:04.340 --> 2:47:32.740]  you know there's a saying that there are no atheist in foxholes and I've had
[2:47:32.740 --> 2:47:38.340]  very powerful spiritual experiences in my life and the more I've studied the
[2:47:38.340 --> 2:47:41.260]  globalists and their whole operations they're not very honest about it they
[2:47:41.260 --> 2:47:46.340]  are Luciferians when you get the top of the world George Soros and his son are
[2:47:46.340 --> 2:47:51.340]  on air in photos at Alistair Crowley events his son every week there's new
[2:47:51.340 --> 2:47:55.300]  photos it's like he lives at these things spirit cooking all this really
[2:47:55.300 --> 2:48:00.460]  evil stuff and then I've noticed most the atheists at the high level aren't
[2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:03.700]  really atheists they just don't want you know there's a God there so they can
[2:48:03.700 --> 2:48:09.340]  feed on you I know you're all about positive stuff Pastor Brown but speaking
[2:48:09.340 --> 2:48:13.660]  to what the devil would do if he gets full control and we don't stand up if
[2:48:13.660 --> 2:48:17.180]  this psychotic evil force in the universe well he wants to destroy
[2:48:17.180 --> 2:48:21.700]  everybody we can see that from the killing of all the babies you know so
[2:48:21.700 --> 2:48:26.060]  the babies are not even safe in their mother's womb and Silicon Valley says
[2:48:26.060 --> 2:48:30.780]  we've got to kill everybody then we become gods yeah then then the plundering
[2:48:30.780 --> 2:48:35.300]  of the children from the pedophilia all the way through the bombardment of the
[2:48:35.300 --> 2:48:39.100]  kids through primary school through high school and then by the time your kid
[2:48:39.100 --> 2:48:42.940]  gets the university he's not even the child that you even knew you sit and
[2:48:42.940 --> 2:48:46.420]  question yourself how did my kid go so they're trying to block people from
[2:48:46.420 --> 2:48:50.740]  finding God by controlling the churches putting drugs in the water the third of
[2:48:50.740 --> 2:48:56.420]  the narrative control the narrative and spin make people victims of anything good
[2:48:56.420 --> 2:49:01.260]  like Western civilization free market God oh that's abusive you don't want that
[2:49:01.260 --> 2:49:05.860]  yeah because he wants to destroy you so the Bible says that the thief come
[2:49:05.860 --> 2:49:09.740]  with but for the steel kill and destroy but Jesus said I'm come that you might
[2:49:09.740 --> 2:49:13.060]  have life and you might have it more abundantly so this is what's so
[2:49:13.060 --> 2:49:17.780]  important that we that everybody does something you know and by the way every
[2:49:17.780 --> 2:49:20.900]  place in the world where there are Christians there is prosperity right
[2:49:20.900 --> 2:49:25.540]  across the line there's not totally even across Africa where I come from every
[2:49:25.540 --> 2:49:29.420]  country that has been the poverty stricken is because they they worship
[2:49:29.420 --> 2:49:33.980]  ancestors they worship idols and you can see it you go to the nations you go to
[2:49:33.980 --> 2:49:38.580]  Haiti you see what's going on the food and and you go to Madagascar where
[2:49:38.580 --> 2:49:42.180]  people worship the ancestors every year they bring the mother and father they
[2:49:42.180 --> 2:49:46.580]  dig him up or their grandparents and walk their bodies around the city to show
[2:49:46.580 --> 2:49:50.700]  them the new happenings of what's taking place so it's a whole it's a whole
[2:49:50.700 --> 2:49:56.060]  another level I mean in India India has 300 million gods and obviously now
[2:49:56.060 --> 2:49:59.780]  India India's received the gospel and India's rising the more millionaires
[2:49:59.780 --> 2:50:04.180]  there than anywhere else in the world so India seeing a whole reformation take
[2:50:04.180 --> 2:50:07.220]  place in India in actual fact I think it shocked the globalist of what's
[2:50:07.220 --> 2:50:10.660]  happening in India and I've read a lot of that Christianity driving totally
[2:50:10.660 --> 2:50:14.540]  totally I mean there's huge churches and people have come it's the gospel it's
[2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:18.500]  the light it's the light of the gospel and connected to God and the Holy
[2:50:18.500 --> 2:50:22.580]  Spirit that's giving people creativity and people inventions and you can see
[2:50:22.580 --> 2:50:26.380]  what happened in America coming out of the first great awakening the 1700s and
[2:50:26.380 --> 2:50:30.700]  the second one in the 1800s and we need another great spiritual well it's like
[2:50:30.700 --> 2:50:34.460]  the reformation led the Renaissance totally so we need another great
[2:50:34.460 --> 2:50:38.540]  spiritual awakening in America so we saw all those kids marching for you know
[2:50:38.540 --> 2:50:42.980]  anti guns and that the day will come when those kids will be packing the streets
[2:50:42.980 --> 2:50:46.500]  and they're gonna be marching for King Jesus I believe that with all my heart
[2:50:46.500 --> 2:50:51.140]  and I feel that we've got this window God is granted that's the last minute
[2:50:51.140 --> 2:50:55.300]  reprieve it's not over yet because let me tell you back in 07 I said the Lord
[2:50:55.300 --> 2:50:59.980]  tell me is it too late it's 07 08 is it too late I'll tell the people because
[2:50:59.980 --> 2:51:04.100]  I'm on a line to them I'll tell them hey so it's it's over and put yourself in
[2:51:04.100 --> 2:51:07.420]  the brace position like they tell you on the aircraft which is not a good thing
[2:51:07.420 --> 2:51:10.140]  because that means you're trying to get your head as close to your but what
[2:51:10.140 --> 2:51:13.260]  you have between your hands you can kiss it goodbye you know it's like we're
[2:51:13.260 --> 2:51:18.180]  going down you know so no the Lord said to me it's not too late and and God is
[2:51:18.180 --> 2:51:22.020]  waiting on us he's waiting on us to stand up and I want to just say this you
[2:51:22.020 --> 2:51:25.300]  know I feel the Lord's hand of protection is on you if they were gonna
[2:51:25.300 --> 2:51:28.100]  take you out they would have taken you out they're not gonna touch you because
[2:51:28.100 --> 2:51:31.500]  of the blood of Jesus that protects you and the angels of God that encamp about
[2:51:31.500 --> 2:51:35.460]  you your wife your children and everything that you touch so don't don't
[2:51:35.460 --> 2:51:39.700]  get frustrated know that the Lord there's a God in heaven and you know he's about
[2:51:39.700 --> 2:51:43.300]  you he said I'll be about you as a wall of fire he told me I feel it yeah I
[2:51:43.300 --> 2:51:46.900]  just feel like I'm doing good enough no no Alex it's not about that you're doing
[2:51:46.900 --> 2:51:50.740]  your best here's the thing everybody must do what they can everybody does
[2:51:50.740 --> 2:51:55.060]  their best and at the end of the day God takes our best and he multiplies I know
[2:51:55.060 --> 2:51:58.300]  I can feel God's strength so I just can't believe that other people don't see it
[2:51:58.300 --> 2:52:01.980]  yeah but that's why I'm gonna preach the gospel to them so that they can
[2:52:01.980 --> 2:52:05.420]  experience the power of the Holy Spirit because it's the Holy Spirit that will
[2:52:05.420 --> 2:52:09.820]  enter like you said we've got to get glorified bodies you would feel God ultimately
[2:52:09.820 --> 2:52:14.220]  we'll get we'll get that we don't know at this juncture but just the edges of it
[2:52:14.220 --> 2:52:17.500]  it's so big on you it's like there's no energy even like it that's why people
[2:52:17.500 --> 2:52:21.500]  don't even know no there's nothing like it so I want to say this you know people
[2:52:21.500 --> 2:52:25.340]  you've been attacked like I've been attacked but I look beyond all of that I
[2:52:25.340 --> 2:52:30.940]  see I said that man God is using him to wake people up and I that's why I said
[2:52:30.940 --> 2:52:34.300]  I said my wife I want to help Alex somehow that's why I sent the books and
[2:52:34.300 --> 2:52:37.860]  all that I come here I actually brought a gift for you today let me just say
[2:52:37.860 --> 2:52:41.620]  fashion Rodney I feel in the spirit strongly when I listen to you and the
[2:52:41.620 --> 2:52:45.460]  person I feel it they should feel good well we praying for you our church is
[2:52:45.460 --> 2:52:49.740]  praying for you and you keep up the good work and don't don't don't don't don't
[2:52:49.740 --> 2:52:54.180]  read don't even react because my first reaction when I was under attack was I
[2:52:54.180 --> 2:52:57.300]  would react to all the bullies and I would get up and what if my listeners

[2:53:59.820 --> 2:54:03.980]  mainstream media it's beautiful so you feel the action on it that's a good
[2:54:03.980 --> 2:54:08.460]  as a just feel that action on it it's got I know it's very nice oh my goodness

[2:54:12.220 --> 2:54:14.900]  I don't even got to catch a plane soon we've got to go shooting oh we're
[2:54:14.900 --> 2:54:19.500]  definitely yeah so I you know I started gun clubs in churches so I know I know
[2:54:19.500 --> 2:54:22.660]  because I'm seeing the news they demonize you we that's one place we're
[2:54:22.660 --> 2:54:26.700]  also winning is the second amendment is this tangible we can feel it because if
[2:54:26.700 --> 2:54:30.060]  they take the second amendment we lose the first amendment so somebody said
[2:54:30.060 --> 2:54:34.620]  shut up we'll come down and make me shut up because the founding fathers didn't
[2:54:34.620 --> 2:54:38.660]  put the second amendment there so we could protect our house or go duck hunting
[2:54:38.660 --> 2:54:42.220]  the founding fathers put the second amendment there so we could protect
[2:54:42.220 --> 2:54:45.540]  us up from a tyrannical government that's right there to defend the first the
[2:54:45.540 --> 2:54:49.620]  fourth everything and guess what they made me swear to defend the Constitution
[2:54:49.620 --> 2:54:54.620]  Alex so they should never made me a citizen as long as I was a green card
[2:54:54.620 --> 2:54:58.940]  holder then everything was okay but the moment they the moment I raised my hand
[2:54:58.940 --> 2:55:02.540]  to say our place to defend the Constitution that was at America you
[2:55:02.540 --> 2:55:08.620]  got me so the Lord is with you my friend oh believe me I can feel it he's with
[2:55:08.620 --> 2:55:12.860]  you and he will help me through all the storms all these attacks in the law
[2:55:12.860 --> 2:55:16.300]  suits they will come unraveled and you know look what's happening even they
[2:55:16.300 --> 2:55:19.540]  try to try it's like everybody that comes against Trump something after to
[2:55:19.540 --> 2:55:23.820]  them I'm saying it's like an unseen hand is dealing with them so people that's
[2:55:23.820 --> 2:55:27.260]  already have a muscle also it's totally but I'm talking about even with our
[2:55:27.260 --> 2:55:30.940]  president no it's happening so we pray for him and God will bring him through as
[2:55:30.940 --> 2:55:34.620]  long as he stays humble and just cries out to God which he is I believe he's
[2:55:34.620 --> 2:55:38.140]  calling out to the law you can see that he said he's changed to nobody's perfect
[2:55:38.140 --> 2:55:42.740]  but he's stronger and stronger and I know he's told me the times I talked to him
[2:55:42.740 --> 2:55:46.060]  that you know he talks about God he really feels that we didn't elect the
[2:55:46.060 --> 2:55:50.940]  Sunday School teacher we that we elected a wrecking ball and that's all we got so
[2:55:50.940 --> 2:55:57.060]  I if he ever hears this Rick on Mr. President Rick on we behind you I agree
[2:55:57.060 --> 2:56:01.260]  you know speaking of Providence or serendipity synchronicity Doug Hagman's
[2:56:01.260 --> 2:56:04.820]  is friends with your co-author and then this was all how he only hosts like every
[2:56:04.820 --> 2:56:07.660]  two three weeks but he happens to be hosting it in your co-authors coming up
[2:56:07.660 --> 2:56:11.660]  today Paul L. Williams so that'll be good correct and they great friends and I've
[2:56:11.660 --> 2:56:14.860]  actually been on Doug Hagman's show so that's no I've seen it it's all just
[2:56:14.860 --> 2:56:18.780]  working out great we're trying to get more board ops and more producers ours
[2:56:18.780 --> 2:56:22.340]  we can do a daily show with Doug and with other co-hosts with him so that's
[2:56:22.340 --> 2:56:26.700]  what we're trying to do in the future here but but just separately the nastiness
[2:56:26.700 --> 2:56:31.580]  of Hollywood that you know the hatred of just how unhappy they are wouldn't be
[2:56:31.580 --> 2:56:34.980]  nice if the leaders of Hollywood found Christ and we should pray for them I
[2:56:34.980 --> 2:56:40.220]  think I think there's a lot of people in Hollywood that are if you really knew
[2:56:40.220 --> 2:56:43.660]  what was going on they're not in agreement but it will oh yeah most of
[2:56:43.660 --> 2:56:47.100]  them don't like it they're bullied into it correct so it's gonna cost them their
[2:56:47.100 --> 2:56:53.060]  future career so I think what wouldn't be great if we had other alternatives for
[2:56:53.060 --> 2:56:57.100]  Hollywood actors to make movies that was outside of the thing since the
[2:56:57.100 --> 2:57:00.580]  awakening happened people even ten years ago still like Hollywood almost no
[2:57:00.580 --> 2:57:04.500]  one likes it if I have Hollywood people on even if they're good people people
[2:57:04.500 --> 2:57:08.340]  don't like it have a pastor on like you they love it people hate the system
[2:57:08.340 --> 2:57:12.540]  yeah I'm saying Hollywood has only now begun to figure out like you said it's
[2:57:12.540 --> 2:57:16.340]  being propped up by government it's gone but what you know we're not only with the

[3:00:12.460 --> 3:00:16.620]  just worked out that his co-author Paul L. Williams is coming up in about six
[3:00:16.620 --> 3:00:19.820]  minutes after this first little segment but I know Doug Hagman's a fan of the
[3:00:19.820 --> 3:00:23.220]  work you do pastor and so I want to get you guys a chance to talk here for a few
[3:00:23.220 --> 3:00:26.860]  minutes but it just comes down to this there are evil forces in the world that
[3:00:26.860 --> 3:00:31.180]  want to dominate the entire continuum of humanity they want to end it they want
[3:00:31.180 --> 3:00:35.060]  to take control of it that's not God's plan God's plan is milk and honey it's
[3:00:35.060 --> 3:00:39.460]  everything good and and people can see that now and so this is quite a time to
[3:00:39.460 --> 3:00:44.540]  be alive but Doug just say how do your pastor friend here.
[3:00:44.700 --> 3:00:48.980]  It's a bullet I'll tell you what a fascinating couple of hours in
[3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:54.060]  incredible stuff Doug it's great to see you as always and I'm I know you're gonna
[3:00:54.060 --> 3:00:59.860]  have my dear friend on shortly Paul Williams so it's absolutely I'll tell
[3:00:59.860 --> 3:01:04.420]  you what your book is fantastic I would urge everyone to get it via info
[3:01:04.420 --> 3:01:08.820]  war store it's incredible it's an incredible read you and Dr. Williams did
[3:01:08.820 --> 3:01:13.540]  a great job on that as well as what's coming up and we've never broken this
[3:01:13.540 --> 3:01:17.900]  before I don't I don't believe publicly we're talking about the Islamic
[3:01:17.900 --> 3:01:23.660]  infiltration via the Islamic training compounds and show some I don't some of
[3:01:23.660 --> 3:01:27.380]  these photographs I don't think we ever saw the light of day of the surveillance
[3:01:27.380 --> 3:01:30.900]  that we did of these Islamic training compounds so looking forward to that but
[3:01:30.900 --> 3:01:34.220]  it's always is great to see a pastor. Great to see you too and keep up the good
[3:01:34.220 --> 3:01:38.660]  work. Just briefly before you guys break all that down what do you make of the
[3:01:38.660 --> 3:01:42.980]  New York Times confirming illegal spying on Trump sounds like they know Trump's
[3:01:42.980 --> 3:01:46.100]  ready to release this stuff and Mueller's in a lot of trouble and you've got
[3:01:46.100 --> 3:01:51.580]  Giuliani saying you better give up right now let me find the exact quote you
[3:01:51.580 --> 3:01:58.020]  better give up right now or ready to rip you apart if you want us to. We know
[3:01:58.020 --> 3:02:01.340]  we've been talking about this Alex we we've been talking about this for weeks
[3:02:01.340 --> 3:02:06.300]  if not months look this was a set up a sting operation of Donald Trump that
[3:02:06.300 --> 3:02:12.100]  went awry of course deep state this whole thing and you're right they are
[3:02:12.100 --> 3:02:16.500]  about right now to the Donald Trump is striking back is fighting back and we
[3:02:16.500 --> 3:02:22.260]  are we the media the honest media is exposing everything that they've done
[3:02:22.260 --> 3:02:27.620]  exposing the setup the entrapment exposing the deep state killing Uncle Sam
[3:02:27.620 --> 3:02:33.700]  a good exhibit court exhibit if you will but now it's a street flight it's a
[3:02:33.700 --> 3:02:38.460]  cage match now you know so this is what we're saying so it's this crossfire
[3:02:38.460 --> 3:02:43.220]  hurricane you know operation of course everything is being exposed and it's
[3:02:43.220 --> 3:02:47.380]  exciting time to be alive for sure all right well that's all coming up we got
[3:02:47.380 --> 3:02:50.940]  about two minutes to break Doug Hagman go ahead and take over thank you all
[3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:56.140]  right thanks Alex I really appreciate it yeah the folks look what is taking
[3:02:56.140 --> 3:03:02.820]  place right now in terms of the exposure of what what is taking place with
[3:03:02.820 --> 3:03:08.300]  respect to McCabe you've heard of that and Comey and his book tour and the
[3:03:08.300 --> 3:03:13.420]  Mueller the larger Mueller investigation all of this is about to fall apart be
[3:03:13.420 --> 3:03:20.780]  crumbled or be shattered it's up to them it's amazing to me how we can have a
[3:03:20.780 --> 3:03:27.060]  week you have gone nearly 500 days of a Donald Trump presidency about 370 some
[3:03:27.060 --> 3:03:33.420]  days at roughly 300 and some odd days well close to a year I guess of the
[3:03:33.420 --> 3:03:39.180]  Mueller investigation Mueller finding nothing and yet yet the continuation of
[3:03:39.180 --> 3:03:45.620]  this probe which is highly illegal most most assuredly the question is are we
[3:03:45.620 --> 3:03:50.580]  going to find are we gonna see are we gonna see justice brought to people like
[3:03:50.580 --> 3:03:57.060]  Comey McCabe ultimately all of the individuals responsible for this
[3:03:57.060 --> 3:04:01.060]  crossfire hurricane all of the individuals responsible for the spying
[3:04:01.060 --> 3:04:04.980]  illegal and illicit spying operations we're gonna see justice brought to these
[3:04:04.980 --> 3:04:12.060]  people is the OIG report that's being really tossed out for is the savior of
[3:04:12.060 --> 3:04:17.380]  things is that OIG report merely going to expose a criminality or is it gonna
[3:04:17.380 --> 3:04:20.020]  have some teeth to it and that's what we're looking at and I have a feeling if
[3:04:20.020 --> 3:04:23.260]  we don't see teeth to that report if we don't see indictments if we don't see
[3:04:23.260 --> 3:04:28.380]  justice then I my prediction is we're gonna see blood in the streets of
[3:04:28.380 --> 3:04:33.020]  America yeah because Americans are sick and tired of this dual justice system
[3:04:33.020 --> 3:04:39.260]  and that's where we're at today so coming up exposing much of the deep state
[3:04:39.260 --> 3:04:43.780]  by way of the CIA operations dr. Paul Williams coming up a great segue or a

[3:06:29.980 --> 3:06:35.340]  terms of the Islamic infiltration before getting to that what a great show
[3:06:35.340 --> 3:06:39.540]  today by the way Alex Jones and Pastor Rodney Howard Brown and of course all
[3:06:39.540 --> 3:06:42.540]  of the information proceeding that and all the great shows throughout the week
[3:06:42.540 --> 3:06:46.180]  but but here's something that I want to I want to mention before getting into how
[3:06:46.180 --> 3:06:51.820]  bad the Islamic infiltration is the issue of censorship we've been talking
[3:06:51.820 --> 3:06:55.940]  about this I've been I've been talking about this on this platform in my
[3:06:55.940 --> 3:07:01.980]  platform the issue of censorship on social media in the law fair being
[3:07:01.980 --> 3:07:07.860]  waged against info wars the celebratory kind of environment that I see on
[3:07:07.860 --> 3:07:12.340]  social media about the attacks against Alex Jones the attacks against info wars
[3:07:12.340 --> 3:07:18.140]  the attacks against the honest media what's this all about well to the people
[3:07:18.140 --> 3:07:25.420]  in I want to just be be blunt here there are tiny puny minuscule minds out
[3:07:25.420 --> 3:07:31.300]  there who are these some people are intellectually bankrupt when they go
[3:07:31.300 --> 3:07:35.740]  after platforms such as info wars and they go after our platform when they go
[3:07:35.740 --> 3:07:40.820]  after the people in the alternative media but don't you find it a little odd
[3:07:40.820 --> 3:07:48.940]  that as we see the exposure of the the illegal illicit spying operations
[3:07:48.940 --> 3:07:55.180]  against Donald Trump as the exposure heightens so does the the censorship
[3:07:55.180 --> 3:08:02.260]  wars do you see any any correlation there I do the more that we that we
[3:08:02.260 --> 3:08:08.460]  expose the enemies of nationalism the enemies of making America great again
[3:08:08.460 --> 3:08:13.460]  the more we expose the enemies who are out there attempting to to silence the
[3:08:13.460 --> 3:08:16.940]  truth about what's really taking place behind behind the curtain beyond the
[3:08:16.940 --> 3:08:22.540]  veil and and beyond the scenes the greater the censorship and we've been
[3:08:22.540 --> 3:08:26.220]  talking about this we are under attack Alex Jones and info wars is under attack
[3:08:26.220 --> 3:08:31.220]  many in the alternative media under the tape under attack and I find it pretty
[3:08:31.220 --> 3:08:36.700]  not just disingenuous but pretty intellectually dishonest when you've
[3:08:36.700 --> 3:08:40.700]  got people out there and into on Twitter on Facebook saying yeah shut them
[3:08:40.700 --> 3:08:46.260]  down yeah the fake peddlers are purveyors of fake news well when you
[3:08:46.260 --> 3:08:49.860]  start looking at the backgrounds of the people who are who are carrying that
[3:08:49.860 --> 3:08:54.540]  torch to have in for shut down that they have our program shut down you start
[3:08:54.540 --> 3:08:57.260]  looking at the background start looking at their agenda you'll see a close ties
[3:08:57.260 --> 3:09:04.260]  in many cases not all but many cases in between the people who are anti-exposure
[3:09:04.260 --> 3:09:10.300]  to the misdeeds the criminal activity of the Clintons and of the Bushes and the
[3:09:10.300 --> 3:09:15.980]  globalists and you know that the usual parties and the more we expose of course
[3:09:15.980 --> 3:09:23.100]  the greater the censorship calls are and the more personal they become and the
[3:09:23.100 --> 3:09:29.020]  more insidious they become so here's my message to you to those people who are
[3:09:29.020 --> 3:09:34.260]  celebrating the fact that oh yeah look at this this is the demise of the
[3:09:34.260 --> 3:09:36.980]  alternative media people in the alternative media and I don't care if
[3:09:36.980 --> 3:09:42.460]  it's info wars you know or or Hagman reporter whatever it doesn't matter to
[3:09:42.460 --> 3:09:47.660]  the people who are celebratory in that in that environment you're next whether
[3:09:47.660 --> 3:09:52.100]  you know it or not you're next because if they can do it to us they will do it
[3:09:52.100 --> 3:09:56.380]  to you and it's the objectionable content which the content that they cannot
[3:09:56.380 --> 3:10:03.620]  counter with facts that's the problem to them you see so they can't counter with
[3:10:03.620 --> 3:10:07.820]  facts no they've got to pull the plug and I've said this before and we're
[3:10:07.820 --> 3:10:13.220]  seeing this being heightened and the censorship increased so that's what I
[3:10:13.220 --> 3:10:18.780]  want you to consider so the next time that you in this and again in this
[3:10:18.780 --> 3:10:24.700]  radically elated fashion want to pile on the dog pile and say well you know what
[3:10:24.700 --> 3:10:30.180]  it's fake news it's all fake news and shut them down it's okay think about what
[3:10:30.180 --> 3:10:35.740]  you're doing because again this is not what it seems to be and it's it's it's
[3:10:35.740 --> 3:10:42.980]  there is a causation there the more that we bring out of course the greater the
[3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:47.340]  cause for censorship so again this is something that I think people really need
[3:10:47.340 --> 3:10:53.020]  to look at from an evidentiary standpoint when you again when you're
[3:10:53.020 --> 3:10:57.860]  calling for the shutdown of alternative media it's just it's just ridiculous but
[3:10:57.860 --> 3:11:04.140]  it's ridiculously evil as well and it's it's kind of Jenna behind it so again
[3:11:04.140 --> 3:11:06.660]  that's that's where we're at now you know it's interesting because we're
[3:11:06.660 --> 3:11:11.980]  waiting for the inspector general's report Michael Horowitz's report and
[3:11:11.980 --> 3:11:16.100]  John Huber's report we're waiting for that to come out we're seeing this we're
[3:11:16.100 --> 3:11:20.500]  seeing this offensive move by Rudy Giuliani of course one of Donald Trump's
[3:11:20.500 --> 3:11:24.220]  lawyers we're seeing all of this this pushback against the deep state by the
[3:11:24.220 --> 3:11:32.620]  Trump team against the fake news that is coming out and we're watching the
[3:11:32.620 --> 3:11:39.940]  really the the special counsel Robert Mueller just attempt to strive for
[3:11:39.940 --> 3:11:45.580]  relevance in this environment the Andrew McCarthy has a great piece in the
[3:11:45.580 --> 3:11:49.820]  national review spinning a crossfire hurricane the times on the FBI's Trump
[3:11:49.820 --> 3:11:53.500]  investigation if you have a chance to check that out in the national review
[3:11:53.500 --> 3:11:59.660]  Andrew McCarthy it's dated today it was published this afternoon and in this in
[3:11:59.660 --> 3:12:06.020]  this in this article he does talk about what is taking place today what is
[3:12:06.020 --> 3:12:10.820]  taking place behind the scenes with the Trump Russia investigation how the name
[3:12:10.820 --> 3:12:17.940]  came about the crossfire hurricane and the one of the quotes in there or one of
[3:12:17.940 --> 3:12:23.540]  the sentences in here I just I love this particular citation here writes Andrew
[3:12:23.540 --> 3:12:27.900]  McCarthy the quick take on the 4100 word opus is that the great lady buried the
[3:12:27.900 --> 3:12:32.940]  lead fair enough you have to dig pretty deep to find that the FBI ran at least
[3:12:32.940 --> 3:12:36.500]  one government informant against the Trump campaign now consider this and the
[3:12:36.500 --> 3:12:39.940]  reason I bring that up I like the writing style but I bring this up because
[3:12:39.940 --> 3:12:44.180]  consider the fact that we had a weaponized Department of Justice and FBI
[3:12:44.180 --> 3:12:52.580]  insert in human assets into the Trump campaign into a political opponents
[3:12:52.580 --> 3:12:58.260]  campaign and I ask you in what world is this right in what country this is the
[3:12:58.260 --> 3:13:03.340]  United States of America this is not some banana republic well it is after of
[3:13:03.340 --> 3:13:10.060]  course the legacy of Obama and that's what this that's what the legacy of
[3:13:10.060 --> 3:13:15.980]  Obama's legacy will be it's a legacy of division a legacy of criminality a legacy
[3:13:15.980 --> 3:13:21.780]  of corruption and we are seeing this come out and we are seeing that there is
[3:13:21.780 --> 3:13:26.620]  there was absolutely no criminal predicate as we've been saying for the
[3:13:26.620 --> 3:13:30.140]  investigators whether the Department of Justice or FBI to launch a an
[3:13:30.140 --> 3:13:33.860]  investigation either a counterintelligence or a criminal investigation into
[3:13:33.860 --> 3:13:38.820]  the Donald Trump campaign there was no Russian collusion proven or sufficient
[3:13:38.820 --> 3:13:45.260]  to rise to the level of a court authorized search warrant little on
[3:13:45.260 --> 3:13:49.980]  FISA warrant which is even a higher standard of evidence so that again
[3:13:49.980 --> 3:13:54.220]  there's no criminal predicate to justify of an investigation of any type
[3:13:54.220 --> 3:14:01.220]  within the Donald Trump campaign so the FBI did not open a criminal
[3:14:01.220 --> 3:14:04.660]  investigation instead the bureau opened a counterintelligence investigation and
[3:14:04.660 --> 3:14:08.980]  that's what I really if you could take nothing else away from this segment
[3:14:08.980 --> 3:14:19.380]  understand that the counterintelligence department of the FBI DOJ hid behind the
[3:14:19.380 --> 3:14:25.500]  car the investigation hid behind the counterintelligence of the FBI DOJ
[3:14:25.500 --> 3:14:30.460]  instead of a criminal investigation which has more transparency they went the
[3:14:30.460 --> 3:14:35.820]  deep dark secret route and that's a counterintelligence investigation that
[3:14:35.820 --> 3:14:44.860]  lady or Sally Yates the woman that operated the deputy as Attorney General
[3:14:44.860 --> 3:14:50.580]  disallowed any investigative oversight including the oversight by the
[3:14:50.580 --> 3:14:55.500]  Inspector General of course creating a wall that walls off the counterintelligence
[3:14:55.500 --> 3:15:01.260]  bureau the walls off the counterintelligence bureau from the Inspector
[3:15:01.260 --> 3:15:06.700]  General's office so everything that they did they didn't secret they did in in
[3:15:06.700 --> 3:15:11.620]  the dark and of course without any kind of oversight so what we're about to see
[3:15:11.620 --> 3:15:16.540]  from the Inspector General from Michael Horowitz is a glimpse into the
[3:15:16.540 --> 3:15:20.380]  criminality the extent of the criminality and the level of criminality
[3:15:20.380 --> 3:15:26.100]  conducted by this previous administration by the way it's Obama gate it's
[3:15:26.100 --> 3:15:32.180]  Clinton gate it's not just Comey gate it is Obama gate because this exists
[3:15:32.180 --> 3:15:36.980]  directly at the feet of Barack Hussein Obama in my view the Marxist Muslim who
[3:15:36.980 --> 3:15:42.820]  occupied the White House for eight years and what we're seeing is the legacy now

[3:21:08.900 --> 3:21:13.700]  Howard brown brown was on with Alex Jones earlier in the show talking about a
[3:21:13.700 --> 3:21:18.460]  number of issues extremely important of course the killing of uncle Sam his
[3:21:18.460 --> 3:21:22.860]  co-author I was able to twist his arm day to get him to join me his co-author a
[3:21:22.860 --> 3:21:29.020]  good friend of mine dr. Paul L. Williams the co-author of the killing of Uncle Sam
[3:21:29.020 --> 3:21:34.260]  but also the author of the day of Islam which I've got a copy right here this
[3:21:34.260 --> 3:21:38.300]  happens to be an advanced copy of the day of Islam the reason I asked dr.
[3:21:38.300 --> 3:21:45.340]  Williams to join me today is to get into something that perhaps you've heard
[3:21:45.340 --> 3:21:49.100]  about but you're not you weren't sure not sure about the validity or the
[3:21:49.100 --> 3:21:53.700]  authenticity of the information and that is of course the discussion of
[3:21:53.700 --> 3:21:57.620]  paramilitary training compounds Islamic paramilitary training compounds
[3:21:57.620 --> 3:22:02.260]  present here in the United States it was about I don't know about it was I
[3:22:02.260 --> 3:22:07.740]  think 2005 2006 when I met dr. Paul Williams up in Toronto Ontario Canada
[3:22:07.740 --> 3:22:15.260]  had a meeting with him and we had just had a tremendously fruitful meeting and
[3:22:15.260 --> 3:22:22.060]  we shared some notes investigative notes subsequent to that we had investigated
[3:22:22.060 --> 3:22:25.580]  and conducted investigation into the paramilitary training compounds the
[3:22:25.580 --> 3:22:29.860]  Islamic paramilitary training compounds here in in America so having said all
[3:22:29.860 --> 3:22:35.060]  of that I asked dr. Ronnie Howard Browns his co-author Paul Williams to join me

[3:23:13.700 --> 3:23:20.900]  both discovered in New York well indeed and of course we're not gonna rehash the
[3:23:20.900 --> 3:23:25.980]  the previous segments of course you can go back to the segments and listen to
[3:23:25.980 --> 3:23:31.300]  Alex and dr. Dr. Brown talk about the killing of Uncle Sam but part and parcel
[3:23:31.300 --> 3:23:38.500]  to that of course the demise of the attacks from within America are the
[3:23:38.500 --> 3:23:42.100]  presence of these Islamic training compounds all across the United States
[3:23:42.100 --> 3:23:48.940]  and dr. Williams I conducted a pretty lengthy surveillance back in 2000 and
[3:23:48.940 --> 3:23:56.100]  I was in the 2000s post 9-11 and followed that up back just a few years
[3:23:56.100 --> 3:24:00.940]  ago of these Islamic training compounds that are formed under what is known as
[3:24:00.940 --> 3:24:06.420]  the Muslims of the Americas Jamal del Fuqra and Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani and
[3:24:06.420 --> 3:24:09.660]  of course you write extensively about that in your book The Day of Islam and
[3:24:09.660 --> 3:24:15.540]  you yourself have been conducted investigations on these compounds I
[3:24:15.540 --> 3:24:20.700]  gotta ask would you find brother first of all let me tell you how I found the
[3:24:20.700 --> 3:24:27.100]  compounds I went to Northeast Intelligence Network and I saw this
[3:24:27.100 --> 3:24:33.700]  report this is going back to maybe about two or three years after 9-11 and it
[3:24:33.700 --> 3:24:40.660]  was a report by Doug Hagman on a place called Islamberg let me state this
[3:24:40.660 --> 3:24:44.820]  emphatically because there are a lot of people who say oh you know we've done so
[3:24:44.820 --> 3:24:52.060]  much investigations into Jamal del Fuqra and into Jalani and into Islamberg I
[3:24:52.060 --> 3:24:57.540]  heard them on Fox News I've heard them on different networks a lot of Christian
[3:24:57.540 --> 3:25:03.460]  broadcast a lot of these people say oh we stumble on this no Islamberg and the
[3:25:03.460 --> 3:25:07.700]  other compounds in the in throughout the United States and there are about 35 of
[3:25:07.700 --> 3:25:13.380]  them the settlements were discovered by Doug Hagman I mean the credit
[3:25:13.380 --> 3:25:19.540]  must go where credit is due it was one of the bravest reports I ran a newspaper
[3:25:19.540 --> 3:25:25.820]  for many years I've been I've written 15 books you know and I've written for
[3:25:25.820 --> 3:25:30.860]  major newspapers every probably major newspaper in the country work with some
[3:25:30.860 --> 3:25:37.980]  very very excellent about investigative reporters that story on Islamberg was
[3:25:37.980 --> 3:25:44.140]  one of the finest maybe the best example of investigative reporting I've ever
[3:25:44.140 --> 3:25:49.580]  seen and after reading that and then I found out it was in Hancock New York or
[3:25:49.580 --> 3:25:55.140]  Doug's findings and he took the photographs and among his photographs
[3:25:55.140 --> 3:26:01.120]  were photographs of the firings the firing range there and then on the firing
[3:26:01.120 --> 3:26:07.020]  range they were they were firing at school buses and there are fire and the
[3:26:07.020 --> 3:26:14.120]  school buses were riddled with machine gun bullets and Doug found also that
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:19.980]  there were obstacle courses there and what I did was I went up to Islamberg
[3:26:19.980 --> 3:26:25.940]  myself just to find out what in fact was going on following his report and I
[3:26:25.940 --> 3:26:31.700]  went up there several times I would say at least half a dozen and I followed
[3:26:31.700 --> 3:26:39.340]  Doug's lead I went into Islamberg in the on the outer outer parameters and I
[3:26:39.340 --> 3:26:44.580]  saw the firing ranges and I photographed them myself as Doug had done I
[3:26:44.580 --> 3:26:50.580]  discovered underground bunkers there I had discovered I talked to there's a
[3:26:50.580 --> 3:26:54.340]  century and Doug you can tell them the people this as well there's a century
[3:26:54.340 --> 3:27:01.300]  post at the at the entrance way to do Islamberg and the guard there had a
[3:27:01.300 --> 3:27:05.340]  semi-automatic weapon when I was there and he stopped us and he was very
[3:27:05.340 --> 3:27:10.500]  friendly though but you know you weren't weren't allowed to go any further and
[3:27:10.500 --> 3:27:16.500]  Islam by the way is very close to the main reservoir that serves New York City
[3:27:16.500 --> 3:27:27.580]  and to your point about the century and just so people understand I conducted
[3:27:27.580 --> 3:27:32.420]  with with the well my team conducted myself and my team we conducted a
[3:27:32.420 --> 3:27:37.020]  surveillance for I don't know probably four or five months and it covered from
[3:27:37.020 --> 3:27:41.620]  the winter months to into the spring and into the summer and this is again
[3:27:41.620 --> 3:27:47.100]  post 9-11 and what we're talking about are these compounds one in particular the
[3:27:47.100 --> 3:27:51.900]  headquarters of Jamal al-Fukar located in Hancock, New York as you stated and as
[3:27:51.900 --> 3:27:56.300]  you've written about in the day of Islam the leader of course is Sheikh Mubarak
[3:27:56.300 --> 3:28:01.180]  Ali Jalani from Pakistan and if that name sounds familiar that is the guy
[3:28:01.180 --> 3:28:05.940]  who had Daniel Pearl was scheduled to meet and was kidnapped never did meet
[3:28:05.940 --> 3:28:09.180]  him and was ultimately beheaded the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl

[3:34:28.180 --> 3:34:32.620]  Muslims of the Americas we're talking about paramilitary training by Islamic in
[3:34:32.620 --> 3:34:38.220]  my view personal opinion based on my observations terrorists in the United
[3:34:38.220 --> 3:34:41.900]  States where we left off we of course we're talking about the investigations
[3:34:41.900 --> 3:34:50.860]  both united yes Doug at Islamberg after I followed up on your original visit
[3:34:50.860 --> 3:34:57.340]  there your your lead what what I interviewed several people from Islamberg
[3:34:57.340 --> 3:35:03.380]  and I found out that at the end of their training they all were going to
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:07.660]  Pakistan there were shit they were all they all went to Pakistan I'll tell you
[3:35:07.660 --> 3:35:12.620]  my major finding at the at the end of the deal with this but they came back
[3:35:12.620 --> 3:35:19.260]  with Pakistan that the the settlement there in in at Islamberg outside of
[3:35:19.260 --> 3:35:24.900]  Hancock New York is now filled with Pakistani women they they practice
[3:35:24.900 --> 3:35:29.220]  polygamy there of course and the the african-americans who are recruited from
[3:35:29.220 --> 3:35:34.420]  the prison system and trained at at Islamberg after their basic training
[3:35:34.420 --> 3:35:40.980]  that they're deployed to Pakistan and from Pakistan they enter Afghanistan and
[3:35:40.980 --> 3:35:48.780]  they fight with the Taliban no yeah dr. Williams how can that be how can how
[3:35:48.780 --> 3:35:53.700]  can America be host to paramilitary training compounds don't doesn't the
[3:35:53.700 --> 3:35:59.300]  FBI know doesn't the CIA know doesn't our government you and I know about we
[3:35:59.300 --> 3:36:03.780]  both reported this to law enforcement agencies I work with the FBI for years
[3:36:03.780 --> 3:36:10.380]  I mean it worked for the FBI for years and I reported to them I report to the
[3:36:10.380 --> 3:36:14.580]  state police I show them pictures everything else and nothing happened the
[3:36:14.580 --> 3:36:18.340]  residents up there as you know you interview them to they they I mean
[3:36:18.340 --> 3:36:22.260]  they're scared witless about you know from the activities that they and the
[3:36:22.260 --> 3:36:25.980]  explosions that they hear from the camp they've called the police they've called
[3:36:25.980 --> 3:36:31.140]  the FBI and nothing has ever done well what this is what I discovered these
[3:36:31.140 --> 3:36:36.100]  people go to Pakistan and that they receive further training and then they
[3:36:36.100 --> 3:36:40.740]  are go from Pakistan into Afghanistan and fight with the Taliban I couldn't
[3:36:40.740 --> 3:36:48.620]  understand that for the longest time and then I then finally it hit me what the
[3:36:48.620 --> 3:36:55.100]  whole thing is a CIA operation which a lot of himself professors to be when he
[3:36:55.100 --> 3:36:59.980]  was in New York at the Yaseem mosque and I went there as well in Brooklyn his
[3:36:59.980 --> 3:37:06.700]  followers they all believed he was CIA and many of the the the operatives the
[3:37:06.700 --> 3:37:13.660]  jihadis from that were trained at Islamberg including Clement Rodney L who
[3:37:13.660 --> 3:37:18.940]  was instrumental in the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 they all
[3:37:18.940 --> 3:37:23.820]  believe they're working for the CIA as well and what what happens is that what
[3:37:23.820 --> 3:37:31.340]  what what what I discovered is that the CIA set up these camps in beginning in
[3:37:31.340 --> 3:37:38.620]  1979 they brought Jelani and Blindshake Rotman from Cairo to the United States
[3:37:38.620 --> 3:37:44.940]  to Andrew Andrews Air Force Base on US military transports they were they were
[3:37:44.940 --> 3:37:53.260]  taken here by the CIA Jelani for for a couple weeks received training from the
[3:37:53.260 --> 3:37:58.240]  CIA at Langley and then he was dispatched to Brooklyn to recruit African
[3:37:58.240 --> 3:38:05.180]  Americans for the great jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan so in the
[3:38:05.180 --> 3:38:11.020]  beginning his efforts were were were confined to Brooklyn and he would he
[3:38:11.020 --> 3:38:16.140]  would recruit jihadis or people who want to take part in the jihad of African
[3:38:16.140 --> 3:38:23.460]  Americans all and and ship them to to Pakistan and later the CIA discovered
[3:38:23.460 --> 3:38:28.500]  that it would be it's much more cost efficient to train these people in the
[3:38:28.500 --> 3:38:33.860]  United States so the CIA set up these training camps including Islamberg and
[3:38:33.860 --> 3:38:39.700]  training camps throughout the country for Jelani and this went on for for 10
[3:38:39.700 --> 3:38:44.380]  years that there were training people for the great you had to take part in
[3:38:44.380 --> 3:38:49.980]  the in the Soviet Afghan war in Afghanistan which made sense to fight
[3:38:49.980 --> 3:38:54.740]  the communists and you we could kind of believe that there was some necessity in
[3:38:54.740 --> 3:38:59.900]  that but at the this is what what what really bothered me for a long time dog
[3:38:59.900 --> 3:39:06.460]  at the end of that at the end of the Soviet Afghan war the CIA continued to
[3:39:06.460 --> 3:39:14.300]  fund Jelani and continue to allow not allow but to work with Jelani to
[3:39:14.300 --> 3:39:18.460]  create more and more and more of these paramilitary camps throughout the
[3:39:18.460 --> 3:39:23.860]  country for it some in Georgia some in Texas some in California some in the
[3:39:23.860 --> 3:39:29.860]  Midwest some in the one in Toronto I mean they're all over the place in
[3:39:29.860 --> 3:39:37.100]  Virginia I visited one Virginia several times but they were all what what I
[3:39:37.100 --> 3:39:43.860]  couldn't put my my brain around was why after the Soviet Afghanistan war was
[3:39:43.860 --> 3:39:53.380]  over why was the CIA continuing to support Jelani and continuing to sprout
[3:39:53.380 --> 3:39:59.780]  these camps up on American soil and then I came to realize and this is what
[3:39:59.780 --> 3:40:04.700]  really that brought me to Rodney Howard Brown and killing Uncle Sam I came to
[3:40:04.700 --> 3:40:10.340]  realize that the CIA all their covert operations are funded by narcotics
[3:40:10.340 --> 3:40:19.060]  primarily heroin and heroin has become the CIA since 1947 never received one
[3:40:19.060 --> 3:40:24.100]  dime for its black operations as covert operations all that funding came from
[3:40:24.100 --> 3:40:31.180]  heroin so the heroin in Afghanistan became vital for the CIA interest at the
[3:40:31.180 --> 3:40:39.620]  end of the Soviet Afghan war and Jelani and his by supporting the Taliban and
[3:40:39.620 --> 3:40:44.540]  these people being trained on our soil going to Pakistan and then joining the
[3:40:44.540 --> 3:40:51.420]  Taliban was really to help with the drug trade exactly and Dr. Williams let me
[3:40:51.420 --> 3:40:56.820]  stop you right there because this is why okay so we conducted I conducted
[3:40:56.820 --> 3:41:02.980]  surveillance and investigation extensive as a matter of fact these are my typed
[3:41:02.980 --> 3:41:08.980]  notes from the investigation I don't know if you that could be seen but I
[3:41:08.980 --> 3:41:15.900]  mean it's it's actually there's about the 400 400 type pages and of course my
[3:41:15.900 --> 3:41:20.220]  handwritten those are elsewhere but but the fact is the photographs video type
[3:41:20.220 --> 3:41:24.820]  notes from the surveillance and investigation we turned it over to the
[3:41:24.820 --> 3:41:29.460]  FBI I know you did I turned it over to the FBI in fact the FBI said hey send
[3:41:29.460 --> 3:41:34.740]  the report here so I did that as you've done it with the FBI with the state
[3:41:34.740 --> 3:41:39.340]  police what happens before the ink is right in those reports all of a sudden
[3:41:39.340 --> 3:41:45.220]  the head of the compounds this network Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jelani he knows
[3:41:45.220 --> 3:41:49.860]  about the reports he knows about the surveillance we've been compromised and
[3:41:49.860 --> 3:41:54.660]  and just weeks later by the way there's a picture of my car I don't know if the
[3:41:54.660 --> 3:42:00.780]  if the camera people can put that car on after I had given the reports to the
[3:42:00.780 --> 3:42:08.660]  FBI I came out of a courthouse and press the FOB the clicker you know
[3:42:08.660 --> 3:42:12.540]  whatever that thing is and that's what that's my car right there on the
[3:42:12.540 --> 3:42:17.220]  screen and now look I'm not saying I'm not saying that I'm not saying I'm just
[3:42:17.220 --> 3:42:20.140]  saying okay I ain't saying because I look I don't know what happened I had a
[3:42:20.140 --> 3:42:24.500]  car fire just pretty interesting days after that Paul I didn't mean to dominate
[3:42:24.500 --> 3:42:29.060]  this segment but only about 30 seconds or about 20 seconds here in fact we're
[3:42:29.060 --> 3:42:32.100]  gonna go to break right now and when we come back you're gonna have the floor
[3:42:32.100 --> 3:42:36.660]  but I just want to say to look the FBI CA they know about this they're in as
[3:42:36.660 --> 3:42:40.780]  Al Jones said and as you've written about the CA is involved the FBI's
[3:42:40.780 --> 3:42:45.140]  involved people say all this BS will know we've got the proof Dr. Paul Williams
[3:42:45.140 --> 3:42:49.700]  got the proof it right back in force.com

[3:47:58.500 --> 3:48:01.780]  this is from the regional organized crime information center right here and
[3:48:01.780 --> 3:48:06.740]  this is dated 2006 Jamal del Fuca and dr. Williams and myself both heavily
[3:48:06.740 --> 3:48:11.500]  cited in this report so we're not making this up this actually did happen and
[3:48:11.500 --> 3:48:15.340]  inside this report are some of the surveillance pictures that we took yes
[3:48:15.340 --> 3:48:20.140]  there is a school bus at the or there was at the time of the surveillance the
[3:48:20.140 --> 3:48:24.540]  school bus being used for target practice and also for military style
[3:48:24.540 --> 3:48:28.500]  occupation of that school bus there it is on your screen now this is actually a
[3:48:28.500 --> 3:48:34.260]  fox news footage your world with Neil Cavuto we borrowed that that frame but
[3:48:34.260 --> 3:48:37.940]  there it is that school bus there riddled with bullet holes and signs of
[3:48:37.940 --> 3:48:43.300]  explosions I was on that school bus on the property I could play it exists and
[3:48:43.300 --> 3:48:48.260]  Paul Williams was there too Paul welcome back thanks Doug call me Paul please
[3:48:48.260 --> 3:49:00.260]  I'm your buddy all right bro does that oh this is clear bro the CIA's what about
[3:49:00.260 --> 3:49:04.540]  the fact that these people at Islamberg and the other compounds throughout the
[3:49:04.540 --> 3:49:11.020]  country have been funded by the CIA and we were discussing also that at the end
[3:49:11.020 --> 3:49:16.900]  of their training at these boot camps they've been set up throughout the
[3:49:16.900 --> 3:49:24.100]  United States Islamic boot camps for the jihad they are they the the the these
[3:49:24.100 --> 3:49:30.220]  would be jihadis go to Pakistan and from Pakistan they go into Afghanistan to
[3:49:30.220 --> 3:49:39.060]  fight with the Taliban and what I discovered Doug with about Jelani and
[3:49:39.060 --> 3:49:46.620]  and and and all of these these operatives is that they have been supported and
[3:49:46.620 --> 3:49:52.540]  continue to be supported by with black funds from the CIA that their purpose in
[3:49:52.540 --> 3:49:57.660]  Afghanistan is to create a strategy of tension and you just think about this
[3:49:57.660 --> 3:50:02.380]  why are they fighting with the Taliban I mean it doesn't make any sense it's
[3:50:02.380 --> 3:50:07.380]  mind-boggling and it was for me for the longest time but what's going on is in
[3:50:07.380 --> 3:50:14.100]  Afghanistan right now we need a strategy of tension we need to to arm and enable
[3:50:14.100 --> 3:50:22.540]  and empower the Taliban so that we have a military presence there because they
[3:50:22.540 --> 3:50:28.460]  would the CIA that the entire funding for the CIA came from the heroin market
[3:50:28.460 --> 3:50:35.020]  and up until this day now the CIA is working with the Mexican cartels and
[3:50:35.020 --> 3:50:41.020]  developing the poppy fields around the Sonora region of of Mexico but pre for
[3:50:41.020 --> 3:50:46.580]  decades and decades and decades our troops were there to protect the heroin
[3:50:46.580 --> 3:50:50.900]  fields you see our soldiers you can you can get pictures of them you know walking
[3:50:50.900 --> 3:50:56.060]  through the fields are not allowed to to to fire bomb not not not allowed to to
[3:50:56.060 --> 3:51:01.540]  to destroy any of the proper the the poppy crops but rather to protect them
[3:51:01.540 --> 3:51:06.220]  it's almost mind-boggling but it goes down like all of our listeners should
[3:51:06.220 --> 3:51:11.380]  be should realize that this has been going on for decades the the importance
[3:51:11.380 --> 3:51:17.420]  of heroin for the CIA because even during the Vietnam conflict when with
[3:51:17.420 --> 3:51:21.860]  soldiers were killed in Vietnam and their bodies were transported here the
[3:51:21.860 --> 3:51:26.060]  bodies were eviscerated and stuff with heroin and carted here I mean that was
[3:51:26.060 --> 3:51:33.100]  front-page story the New York Times this is not conspiracy this this is all
[3:51:33.100 --> 3:51:40.300]  fact the Cary Commission who probed into the CIA established the fact that the
[3:51:40.300 --> 3:51:46.100]  CIA had created banks to launder money throughout the world drug money and and
[3:51:46.100 --> 3:51:51.820]  that the source of all their covert funding is heroin and this was brought
[3:51:51.820 --> 3:51:57.340]  out before the American people so these paramilitary camps when I when I
[3:51:57.340 --> 3:52:02.980]  discovered this that when you look into the mirror and you're looking you're
[3:52:02.980 --> 3:52:08.740]  trying to find the enemy you're looking at the enemy the enemy is us because we
[3:52:08.740 --> 3:52:12.780]  we created the strategy attention in Afghanistan the Taliban of course had
[3:52:12.780 --> 3:52:18.940]  nothing to do with 9-11 everything that we're doing is being we're being
[3:52:18.940 --> 3:52:24.060]  puppeteered and when I when I discovered that when I discovered the most
[3:52:24.060 --> 3:52:29.140]  radical mosque in the country like the Al Farooq mosque in Brooklyn which you were
[3:52:29.140 --> 3:52:33.380]  held you visited and you were held captive there yeah but I would but I
[3:52:33.380 --> 3:52:38.780]  also discovered dug digging into it is that this mosque receives over the Al
[3:52:38.780 --> 3:52:44.620]  Farooq mosque over two million dollars a year from US taxpayers and funds I mean
[3:52:44.620 --> 3:52:51.460]  come on the Gulen movement is sponsored by the CIA all of these so what I when I
[3:52:51.460 --> 3:52:57.020]  discovered that and all the books that I had written before them like Samas
[3:52:57.020 --> 3:53:02.220]  revenge the Nixon 11 everything that I had written was a lie I spent my life
[3:53:02.220 --> 3:53:08.020]  propagating a lie I believe I had been trained at the I worked for William F.
[3:53:08.020 --> 3:53:14.140]  Buckley at the National Review I wrote I was I wrote the articles I wrote
[3:53:14.140 --> 3:53:19.140]  articles for him and I was trained as a neocon and everything that I was led to
[3:53:19.140 --> 3:53:25.980]  believe was a lie that that really everything that was going on was
[3:53:25.980 --> 3:53:35.900]  propagated by their false flag attacks false news manipulation and I have been
[3:53:35.900 --> 3:53:41.140]  manipulated as much as probably more so than anyone in the country and when I
[3:53:41.140 --> 3:53:47.180]  came to to realize that I was crushed and that's when I met Dr. Rodney Howard
[3:53:47.180 --> 3:53:51.940]  Brown I met him at an event in Washington DC a patriotic event would
[3:53:51.940 --> 3:53:56.900]  work for fireworks display really I wasn't there for any religious reason but
[3:53:56.900 --> 3:54:02.780]  I met Rodney there Dr. Rodney Howard-Brown and I started talking to him
[3:54:02.780 --> 3:54:06.860]  about you know this this government it's not a deep state I can see when deeper
[3:54:06.860 --> 3:54:15.140]  than that it's it's it's a group a small group of international bankers and
[3:54:15.140 --> 3:54:20.300]  businessmen who control every bloody thing and I talked to Rodney about that
[3:54:20.300 --> 3:54:25.060]  and he said well it all began it all started with Cecil John Rhodes in South
[3:54:25.060 --> 3:54:31.220]  Africa in 1877 when he formed his secret society and even in the secret
[3:54:31.220 --> 3:54:37.060]  society were the most powerful people in London the Rothschilds, Reginald Britt,
[3:54:37.060 --> 3:54:42.540]  the Balfors, the most powerful people in England formed the society and it got
[3:54:42.540 --> 3:54:48.500]  transplanted here through JP Morgan and Carnegie and the Rockefellers and they
[3:54:48.500 --> 3:54:53.180]  controlled they could look at from they created the Federal Reserve they created
[3:54:53.180 --> 3:54:58.900]  the the Council on Foreign Relations and from the bowels of the the very bowels
[3:54:58.900 --> 3:55:04.220]  of the Council on Foreign Relations the inner core of that came the CIA as an
[3:55:04.220 --> 3:55:08.820]  excrement from the from the Council on Foreign Relations but controlled by them
