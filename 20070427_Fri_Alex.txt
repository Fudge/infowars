[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Find out right now.
[00:30.000 --> 00:47.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[00:47.000 --> 00:56.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00.000 --> 01:20.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome. It is Friday, the 27th day of April, 2007, and
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  we're going to be live here for the next three hours. We have a German expert on the disappearance
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  of the honeybees here in the United States and in Europe. Joining us coming up in the
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.000]  second hour, in 30 minutes, Ted Pike, Pastor Ted Pike, to give us an update on the continual
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  assault on the First Amendment by the forces of tyranny and the New World Order. This is
[01:48.000 --> 01:55.000]  one of the most serious assaults in the 20 plus year history of attacks directly on the
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  First Amendment. He will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes. They have legislation introduced
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  right now, and it's going to be a huge battle, not just today, but throughout next week as
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  they attempt to pass an actual ban on free speech in the United States. Now, I want to be
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  clear here. They have arrested Christians for preying on street corners. They have arrested
[02:19.000 --> 02:26.000]  demonstrators for holding up signs that say no blood for oil. Luke Rudowski of New York
[02:26.000 --> 02:35.000]  9-11 Truth called us about, it was on April 11th, the day it happened, and said, I was
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  just detained, arrested by the police. And that's standard. I've had them detain me.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  I've seen them arrest many others. And I went and watched a little bit of the video, and
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  it was like 15 minutes. I didn't watch it all. And I had Luke on about it, frankly,
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  not even watching all the video, just going off his word. That's how busy I am. I got
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  around last night, because he was on a few days ago, and popped in, and he mentioned
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  that, said, I promised to watch it, so I did watch it. Blew me away. You have guys that
[03:05.000 --> 03:13.000]  look like they're out of central casting from The Godfather or Goodfellas or The Sopranos.
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  I mean, they're more mafia than that. And it's Silverstein security guys, and they walk
[03:20.000 --> 03:29.000]  up to Luke and the 9-11 Truthers, the local 9-11 group there in New York, and said, you
[03:29.000 --> 03:38.000]  are a terrorist. That is a bomb. Turn your cameras off. And they call the police. They're
[03:38.000 --> 03:48.000]  on the city sidewalk. The police come and arrest him. And then to see the cops and the
[03:48.000 --> 03:55.000]  security people laughing with pleasure as they literally slit the throat of the country.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  I mean, they are... You've seen the famous black and white footage of Nazis loading people
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  on cattle cards or demanding the CIDs and shaking people down. But at least they were
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  serious about it. It was horrible what they were doing, but it was very mechanical. I
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  guess there was some professionalism to it. Very wicked. But to just see frothing gangsterism
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  to... I mean, I've never seen anything like this. When the Communist Chinese arrest you
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  for your speech and drag you off, they're very serious. We've hit a new low, ladies
[04:26.000 --> 04:33.000]  and gentlemen. I mean, they actually are like, you know, that 14-year-old punk kid who liked
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  to beat up 10-year-olds and 9-year-olds. He'd go out to the playground at the neighborhood
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  to do it. You know that type of person. Weak, soft, pathetic, trash of the earth. The most
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  unmanly type of soft filth, but putting on a big act. You know the type. I just detest
[04:49.000 --> 04:58.000]  them. Just literal filth of earth, ladies and gentlemen. I was part of... Of course,
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.000]  Mark Dice had a good idea, John Connor. Formerly known as John Connor. To do a Truth Jam where
[05:05.000 --> 05:10.000]  he put a thousand dollar reward out for people to put their best video together. I don't
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  know if Luke won with this video. He should have. But that video is up on prisonplanet.com.
[05:15.000 --> 05:23.000]  I've told Paul Watson to repost it. We had it up a week ago. But yeah. I mean, they walk
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  right up and say, you're a terrorist. You're going to jail for 30 days. And they go, we
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  know you're not a terrorist, but that's the fun thing about this. And they all start laughing.
[05:32.000 --> 05:41.000]  I mean, you're watching the death of America. It's here after a year in production and traveling
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  to distant lands. My new film, Terror Storm, is complete. Shocking declassified government
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their
[05:50.000 --> 05:56.000]  relations as a pretext to enslave them. Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence. Terror
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.000]  Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate
[06:05.000 --> 06:11.000]  fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  more. Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism.
[06:15.000 --> 06:20.000]  It's an anthology of government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to
[06:20.000 --> 06:26.000]  be truly informed must see. Get your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  the market. These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems. They can purify raw, untreated
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.000]  water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.000]  as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE. These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  such as lead, mercury, and aluminum. Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  water like food coloring particles. Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  needs. Moreover, because they are re-cleanable, Black Berkey elements are more economical
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  than the standard disposable elements providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  gallon. Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $1.88 by calling New Millennium at

[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  Government is best which governs least. Wake up and smell the fascism. Being in government
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  means never having to say you're sorry. What part of unconstitutional do you not understand,
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  George? In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  we still have is our freedom of speech. Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your

[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  Walter Hefecker, I'm pronouncing that right, is a German beekeeping expert, a professor,
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  a bunch of other things, but he recognizes the leading expert in Europe, or one of the
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  leading experts in Europe on bees. There's all these studies coming out about the GMO
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  corn, one particular type, the BT Monsanto corn, which has a pesticide that grows in
[09:15.000 --> 09:26.000]  the corn. It's a biocrop, a pharmacological crop, and it kills insects that eat it. And
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  yes, it's approved for humans to eat because you're a lot bigger and it won't kill you
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  right away. This is the insanity, ladies and gentlemen, but don't worry about that. Just
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  go join a local environmental group that steals farms and ranches and go be part of smart
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  growth to set up a North American union and a carbon tax and feel real good while the
[09:45.000 --> 09:54.000]  elite flies around above us in their private jets. Meanwhile, we're eating pesticide in
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  one of the most popular and most used types of corn. I'm already digressing and getting
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  into the story. He'll be joining us in the second hour. We're going to have a quick one
[10:04.000 --> 10:13.000]  segment update from Reverend Ted Pike from TruthTellers.org about the serious First Amendment
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  attacking legislation moving forward. I, late last night, finally watched the entire, I
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  don't know, it must be 20 minutes of Luke Rudowski and New York 9-11 Truth up in New
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  York City. I've known Luke for a couple of years, but I've never seen any footage like
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  this. I've never seen anything like it. This is the worst. And again, I had cops laughing
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  at me, snickering, screaming at me, threatening to arrest me for no reason. We had so many
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  examples. We only put like three examples in martial law. We can't make the whole film
[10:47.000 --> 10:56.000]  that. Now, that was in 2004. And this dovetails in with what Ted Pike's talking about. I was
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  there for the RNC. And when I went back to New York last year, I said about 65, 70% of
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  the cops were, hey, Alex Jones, keep it up. We appreciate you. Cops and captains in their
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  Keep it up, Alex. We had video cameras on them. Some cops would still stick their legs
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  out in front of you when you were walking and try to trip you and then laugh. So you
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  got two kinds of cops in New York. You got good, hardworking family men and women. And
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  then you've got literal gangster types. And for those that don't know, there are a lot
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  of New York cops who are in the mafia. And then you've got all the wannabes and the toadies
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.000]  and that's part of that whole culture. But I've never seen footage like the footage I
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  finally watched. It's been out for over a week. It happened back on April 11th. Luke
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  called us the day it happened, but we'd already gone off air. And I kind of just glazed over
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  it. So much is happening. And they put some music behind it. It's kind of hard to play
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  it on air and hear all the audio of the cops snickering and laughing and get exactly what
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  they said. Luke had offered a few weeks ago to send us the raw footage and I was just
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  so busy. I said, nah, I'd never even watch it. Literally, we're inundated here. But he
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  is going to send me the raw footage. We will play that on air. I may even try to play the
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  other, but again, it's really hard to hear with the music. I mean, it's really good with
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  the video, but I'm not knocking how they did it. But it's just not really suitable for
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  radio, especially AM stations and shortwave that picked this up. I guess FM stations,
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  you'd hear it pretty good. But we still may try on the third hour because we're going
[12:33.000 --> 12:41.000]  to get Luke on. But I mean, you've got to see the video to really pick up how amazing
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  it is. I thought I had it here. I keep forgetting Luke's new website. I'm going to get that
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  and plug that on there because it's on their main page. And we've also got it from last
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  week on prisonplanet.com and the features. You can find it there. Again, I told Paul
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  Watson to repost it a few hours ago. I don't know if he's done that yet on the main page
[12:59.000 --> 13:06.000]  of prisonplanet.com, so it's easy to find. But it reminds me of Philadelphia. And we
[13:06.000 --> 13:14.000]  have video of Philadelphia. But even in Philadelphia, what they did was horrible, wicked, chilling.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  I mean, literally, I get chills when I see this. This is Soviet Union. This is Communist
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.000]  China. This is Nazi Germany. But they were still, the cops weren't laughing and relishing
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  and in pleasure. In fact, some of the police apologized to them once the Christians were
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.000]  in the paddy wagon, all facing 47 years apiece. That was in the major newspapers, by the way,
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  47 years apiece. At least they didn't like it but were following orders. And that's bad
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  enough. Following orders to shoot little kids in the head and Nazi Germany doesn't cover
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  it. Following orders in the Soviet Union, technical to gulags, doesn't cut it. You're
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  still criminals. But at least they didn't relish it. In this New York footage, there
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  is a relishing. By the way, I've got huge news on the economy, but frankly, that pales
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  insignificance to this. We could always rebuild our economy if we had liberty, but if we don't
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  have the liberty, we have nothing. So I'm going to get Ted Pike before he talks about
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  the new hate crowns legislation to recap what happened in Philadelphia. And then the
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.000]  amazing thing was the newspapers were calling for them to serve the 47 years. The newspapers
[14:22.000 --> 14:30.000]  were saying, yes, we need, in Philadelphia and in a few national publications, said yes.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  So-called liberal publications said it was good. The ACLU said, well, was mute on it.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  The ACLU, when they'd be breaking pro-lifers' arms for being 100 feet away from the door
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  of an abortion clinic, I mean, even if you're for abortion or against it, the point is,
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  they were, I mean, I got video, it's in, by the way, martial law and the extras, breaking
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  women's arms, breaking men's arms. I mean, on purpose. Twisting them and breaking and
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  cops smiling. So I guess there is some pleasure in going on there. I guess it's not the first
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  time I've seen it, but I've never seen anything like New York. The point is, there's celebration
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  of evil. There's giggling and smacking and laughing. And they're saying to Luke, you're
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  going to go to jail as a terrorist. You are a terrorist. And they're saying, yeah, that
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  backpack he's got, it's got a bomb. By the way, that violates federal law. In fact, I
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  could dig out the very laws. It's against the law to claim a bag has a bomb in it. And
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  he says, it has a bomb. But again, they're allowed to do that. It's totally different.
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  He says, that bag's got a bomb. This guy's a terrorist. And he's saying it loud in public.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  It could have caused total panic in New York, just a few blocks from ground zero. You've
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  got a Silverstein thug just announcing he's got a bomb. He's a terrorist. Call the police.
[15:49.000 --> 15:56.000]  And Luke's going, excuse me, sir. That's slander. We're just here with a sign stating that 9-11
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  is an inside job. And the cops come up and the guy says, he's got a bomb. And the cops
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  go, all right, we're taking you to jail. And they're laughing and going, it doesn't matter
[16:06.000 --> 16:11.000]  that you're not a terrorist. We love the new system. It's all on tape. We love the, we
[16:11.000 --> 16:17.000]  love the new system there. It's all mafia, total mafia tone. We love the new system.
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  Yeah, we know you're not a terrorist, but you're going to jail now. We'll see if you
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.000]  ever get out of that hole. It's just like, we've killed America. It's so much fun. It's
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.000]  so good. I've built this up enough. I think for those that don't have internet or don't
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  have access to a computer, I better play it in the third hour. See what you can do with
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  it. John Harmon up there at the network. Again, you can hear him and see it. And it works
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  with video cause you can watch your lips move. It's just something about when you lose
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  the lips, it just, it's hard to pick up with music over it. But again, I liked the music,
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  good music. They chose just, I think raw. It's going to be even more powerful because
[16:59.000 --> 17:05.000]  you don't need to add scary music to this folks. I mean, literally few things scare
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  me. It's not even more scared. It's more, I'm just freaked out watching this. I actually,
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  my stomach was turning last night and me and Rob, uh, we were talking about, we were talking
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  and me and Rob, uh, Jacob's somewhere up here at the office working until two in the morning.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  And we were watching it about one 30 before we left. And we were just going, my God, my
[17:23.000 --> 17:28.000]  wife didn't even want to watch this morning. She goes, I know, I know. She's like, I know
[17:28.000 --> 17:37.000]  how bad it is. But, um, the Christians, they had the outfest, uh, there in Philadelphia.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  And so the Christians went and they were, they were praying on the street corner and
[17:41.000 --> 17:47.000]  there was a public open event in the city. And the police come up and say, uh, we've
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.000]  been told you're not allowed to be here. And they said, it's first amendment. We're allowed
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  to. And the police said, okay, just go to this free speech zone. They go to the barricades.
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  Another few minutes is all there's video of all this. It's up on their website. It's on
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  fruit tellers website. It's on the Christian group. We've had on many times out of Philadelphia
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  and they come up and they say, okay, come over here now. And they got daddy wagons and
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  they go, you're being charged, uh, with, uh, inciting terrorism and, and, and then
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  they charge him and they were all, well, they arrested like 15 people later. They dropped
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000]  it down to eight. They were facing 47 years of peace and then he went to trial. I mean,
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  they impaneled the jury and everything and were, uh, and it was in the newspaper. They
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  need 47 years and folks, it's video of them kneeling and praying. We are China. The last
[18:33.000 --> 18:42.000]  vestiges are going, do you understand America? I have video. It's up on the site of, I've
[18:42.000 --> 18:48.000]  seen it with my own eyes, them going, he's a terrorist. He's got a Bob. He just said
[18:48.000 --> 18:55.000]  it and the cops are like, that's right. He does. Let's take him down. I mean, it's just
[18:56.000 --> 19:03.000]  my God, what have we turned it to? This is what cameras rolling. Can you, um, I told
[19:03.000 --> 19:08.000]  you folks, when we show you the, the, the, the, the federally written manuals for the
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.000]  state police and others from Arizona to Virginia to Texas, where it says cell phones, people
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.000]  with babies, people who wear blue jeans, people who talk about the constitution are terrorists
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  call the police. We don't just have those manuals. Then we show you Abby Newman in 2000
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  before nine 11 with state police, they pull her over. I mean, she, she's at a checkpoint.
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  There's all these cars and she goes, you can't search my car without a warrant. And they
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  go, yes we can. And they get her out of the car. She doesn't resist. They charge her with
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  resisting. She was found not guilty. It went to trial. She was going to go away for like
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  at least three years per count. And they go look and they pull out a pocket constitution
[19:44.000 --> 19:51.000]  and it's on tape. They go, this may be illegal. Do you understand the brain washing level
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.000]  out? It ought to put all this together. The stuff with Luke and that Gabby Newman video,
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  I bet listeners, you can do it. Just go slap it together. YouTube people get it out there.
[19:59.000 --> 20:06.000]  We'll link to it. I mean, just all the times and that Christian video where they're taken
[20:06.000 --> 20:11.000]  them to jail for praying and they're going, this may be illegal. And the one state police
[20:11.000 --> 20:16.000]  guy goes, no, she may be allowed to have that. And they have, they go and the other one goes,
[20:16.000 --> 20:25.000]  okay, may be allowed to have the constitution. Maybe have a copy. See, I mean, it's just,
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  oh my God, they're building FEMA camps, everything. And they will move against us.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  survive the treatment? Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning
[20:52.000 --> 21:00.000]  of your entire system are totally unnecessary? But now it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed

[21:37.000 --> 21:44.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book. The commodity markets like gold,
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.000]  silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year. This is a glaring testimony
[21:49.000 --> 21:55.000]  of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued. Many have turned to precious metals to provide
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  a safe haven while increasing the potential profits. Though accumulating precious metals
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  the market you are getting into. Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  for only $27.95. The Red Book is the number one bestselling guide to gold and silver coins.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  Call for your copy today. It's 800-686-2237. If you've already accumulated or plan to
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.000]  get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library. Call
[22:28.000 --> 22:35.000]  800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  are absorbed through the skin. The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead,
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  shower. The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable. The KDF Shower Filter
[23:02.000 --> 23:08.000]  will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants,
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and
[23:13.000 --> 23:20.000]  bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF Shower Filter, normally $49, for our special price
[23:20.000 --> 23:30.000]  of only $35, a $14 savings. Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438. Order today and save $14

[24:56.000 --> 25:22.000]  Oh, yeah. Welcome back. I'm glad that you have decided to join us. Okay, I'll get more
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  into the First Amendment in the next segment, but we're going to do an article at prisonplanet.com.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  There's so many other examples. Remember the guy at the shopping mall with the Peace on
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  Earth shirt, and they think it's an anti-war shirt so they arrest the city attorney? I
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  mean, that's the mindset, but they could argue that in the mall. You know, well, this is,
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  you know, we can say what's in here and what's not. But to see the pleasure in destroying
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  America, to see the enjoyment, and that's all it is. Organized crime. It's real simple.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  Organized crime. I know I say this every day, but it's important to state this. Organized
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  crime took over America. They own fancy PR firms and propaganda arms, and they're very
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  slick at basically shelling why they're doing all this. But the truth is they're grabbing
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  over a million kids a year. The truth is the borders are wide open. The truth is they're
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  poisoning the food and water supply and genetically engineering the entire biosphere. The truth
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  is they're setting up world government. They're launching criminal wars, and we're in deep,
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  deep trouble. All right, let me get into the financial news here. Yesterday I said
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  I'd get into weather control news. I never did it. I will cover that too. Now, they actually
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.000]  talk about chemtrails in the Wall Street Journal and say it's real. Yeah, I never got to that
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  yesterday. It's up on Prison Planet if you want it. But let me get into this first. I
[26:39.000 --> 26:45.000]  am so busy fighting the new world order and dealing with harassers and, you know, just
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  the regular daily stuff that goes on around here that I haven't even had time to even
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  try to position my children's college funds, which I knew would never even be there anyway,
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  so what's the point, into something safer? So the last few years my savings has been
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  devalued by about half. People wonder why the stock market is at a record level yesterday.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  Well, that's because the dollar's been devalued by half, so it takes double the dollars to
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.000]  chase it. People tell me, are my stock portfolios up 30% in the last two years? And I'm like,
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.000]  yes. And did you know that's a net loss? But you can't explain it to them. They don't
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  want to be given the bad news. Now, if we got the news, we could probably rectify this
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  and turn this around and make the White House change policies to try to sure up the dollar.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  For four years, the White House has had a public policy to drive down the dollar. The
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  agreements have been made. It's been announced at Davos four years ago that there has been
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  a decision for a, quote, slow slide of the dollar to about 30%, or maybe even lower,
[27:45.000 --> 27:52.000]  of its original value in 2000. Ladies and gentlemen, this is so catastrophic. Thank
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  God I don't care that much about money. I mean, this money-worshipping society, the
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  general public, if they knew, because they don't, I've been on airplanes trying to talk
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  to businessmen about this, they have, again, a built-in aversion to reality and anything
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.000]  threatening, yuppies make the decision to just claim they know about it or put some
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  spin on it. You know what I'm talking, you know how people do that. I'm like, hey, you
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  know, the dollar's plunging right now. It's all by design. Oh, it's by design, huh? Well,
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  listen, you know what it means to have a currency being evaluated? Huh, well, not all I know
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  is my stocks are up. No, listen, it's being done by design to get rid of the middle class
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  and I can, and of course, I said a little bit better than that when I'm talking to somebody,
[28:31.000 --> 28:38.000]  but they just don't know. They're just not aware. Here is AP, just out in the last few
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  hours, and by the way, since this came out, it's plunged even further. Yeah, it's not
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  slowly dropping now, ladies and gentlemen, it is in absolute free fall. We're talking
[28:47.000 --> 28:55.000]  dropping a cent a day now. I mean, we are in absolute hair on fire plunge mode right
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  now. You ever wanted to know what it felt like to plunge into a depression? You're now
[28:59.000 --> 29:06.000]  feeling it. But the mind control is so great, the people don't even know. And in a way,
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.000]  that's almost good, because they just keep going on and operating as if it, you know,
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  in the short term, I'm kind of going, well, at least in a way, I'm going, well, at least
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  they don't know, so it isn't a total plunge, but when they do find out, it'll be 10 times
[29:18.000 --> 29:24.000]  worse, so then I actually want to warn people. You know what I mean? It's like, I've just
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  never seen anything like it. I'm actually a specialist right now, and I talk to people
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  in the airport flying out to LA, flying back, I talk to businessmen, and I'd say, hey, did
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  you hear? Because I'd see them read the newspaper and say dollar dropping, and I saw that like
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  twice with the Wall Street Journal, another time within the USA Today. And I said, hey,
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  you know, the dollar's really dropping, and I knew what they'd say. They'd say, yeah,
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  but that's good for manufacturing. And they all have, because they've all been reading
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  the same propaganda. They're telling people it's good in the newspaper. And I'm like,
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  no, no, no, no, no, you notice that in the drop in the last, you know, four years in
[29:55.000 --> 30:00.000]  the dollar that it actually hasn't helped manufacturing. And they go, yeah, I guess,
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  and they just turn back to their newspaper. So I'm going to briefly get to this, and then
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.000]  to Ted Pike. Go ahead and get Ted on, but I'm going to cover this when we get back.
[30:08.000 --> 30:14.000]  Euro raises to record high versus the dollar. It's never been this high. It is now at
[30:14.000 --> 30:20.000]  136.82. Ladies and gentlemen, it was trading at 80 cents against the dollar in 2000. This
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  is unprecedented.
[30:25.000 --> 30:32.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, what shall be the signs of thy coming and the end
[30:39.000 --> 30:44.000]  of the world? You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, for nation shall rise against nation
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  places. We are living in this time of Earth's history. Many people are trying to understand
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  the climactic world events in light of human wisdom. But without the wisdom of God, this
[30:57.000 --> 30:58.000]  is impossible.
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  2 Peter says, we have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[31:03.000 --> 31:08.000]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the unholy alliance.

[32:10.000 --> 32:15.000]  are far in advance of today's news? It discusses a common economic system called the Mark of

[32:40.000 --> 32:45.000]  year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back. Ethos FR, a product tested

[32:57.000 --> 33:02.000]  the source of the problem, unburned fuel. You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel
[33:02.000 --> 33:06.000]  that's expelled from your tailpipe. That equates to toxins being released into the
[33:06.000 --> 33:11.000]  environment and dollars being released from your wallet. But with Ethos FR, fuel burns
[33:11.000 --> 33:16.000]  more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.

[34:03.000 --> 34:12.000]  I'll be watching. From liberals to conservatives, libertarians, 9-11 truthers, they're arresting
[34:12.000 --> 34:19.000]  people, charging them. We now have police on tape and security guards saying that people
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  are terrorists and arresting them. Saying, you are terrorists, you have a bomb, and then
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  laughing and saying, we know you don't, but it doesn't matter. Ha ha ha ha, and saying
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.000]  we love the new system. I mean, this is scary. And Ted Pike's been warning you about it for
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  many years, over a decade since he learned of it. He's a very gracious individual. He
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.000]  even let us post some of his videos at prisonplanet.tv for the members up there so you can go and
[34:45.000 --> 34:51.000]  learn the truth about the hate bills and about the ADL and other groups out there that are
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  openly trying to destroy America. Let me just briefly give you the financial news here.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  Euro raises a record high versus the dollar. The Euro reaches an all-time high against
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  the dollar Friday when the weak U.S. growth figures reinforce worries about a widening
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  economic disparity between Europe and the United States. But again, you tell the average
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.000]  person in the airport, the average business traveler, hey, you know, the government's
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.000]  behind the drop in the dollar, this is a globalist decision. And Heather's North American
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  Union, and they just say, no, that's not true, everything's fine. Or you tell them, Heather,
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  they're attacking the First Amendment. No, that's not true, it can't happen here. The
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.000]  surge will not be kind to Americans visiting Europe this summer who will feel the effect
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.000]  in higher prices at hotels in Rome, entrance fees at the Louvre, and cherry beer in Belgium.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  Look how that's written like, oh, this will affect you when you're overseas. No, Bush
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.000]  gives you 5, 6, 7% tax cut depending on your bracket. The New World Order does, and he's
[35:49.000 --> 35:55.000]  a puppet, and Haley was a conservative, and then they debased the currency by over half,
[35:55.000 --> 36:02.000]  over half in its value against foreign currencies, more than half against the pound, now at half.
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  It's always been about 47% now, went well over that, 47% down against the euro total.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  And it's just total devastation. But this is what occurs to the nation, this is what
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.000]  happens. They've been telling you how great the economy is the whole time, why all the
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  really big financial publications have got the elites and the upper middle classes scrambling
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.000]  to get out of the stocks and bonds and into hard assets. Economic growth slows to 1.3%,
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  and that's with cooked numbers, okay? I'm going to get more into this later in the show,
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  we're only going to have the bee expert on about all the bees dying, you know, 70% in
[36:37.000 --> 36:47.000]  Texas, 60 plus percent in other areas of the country. A lot of them died in Europe,
[36:47.000 --> 36:54.000]  that is coming up. So we'll be talking about that too, but in the second half of the next
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  hour I'll be getting in to warn the economy and taking your calls, and we also have a
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  Luke Rudowski with his first two of them being violated in the last half of the third hour
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  coming up. I'm going to a man who has literally been a prophet warning us about this modern
[37:07.000 --> 37:14.000]  day, modern day muckraker exposing these people, it is Pastor Ted Pike, Reverend Ted Pike of
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  truthsellers.org. Thank you so much for coming on, sir.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.000]  Before you came on, I was chronicling this cursed nation, and we really are cursed now
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  for our wickedness, there's no doubting it, even if you're not a Christian, you do reap
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  what you sow, cause and effect, what comes around goes around, as they say. And I chronicled
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  state police arresting people for pocket constitutions, I have it on video. Training manuals
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  saying Christians are terrorists, period, and I have video of FEMA teaching that to police.
[37:46.000 --> 37:53.000]  I have Christians being arrested for preying on their knees in a public, on the sidewalk,
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  and being charged 47 years, as you know, as you broke, as you've covered. We have the
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  liberals out protesting and getting two years in prison for standing with a sign, no blood
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  for oil, but 500 pro-Bush people can stand there at an unannounced demonstration. I have
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.000]  Luke Rudowski of 9-11 Truth in New York, with the police and security guards saying, I say
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  you've got a bomb and you're a terrorist, and yelling, he's got a bomb, and then arresting
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  him for having a 9-11 sign, and then laughing and saying, yeah, we made it up, you're going
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  to jail. I mean, with cameras rolling, they don't, we have entered, even the Soviets weren't
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  this open. They did the torturing and the lying and the framing underground at gulags
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.000]  in police facilities. Reverend Pike, what has happened to us? Well, in short, we have
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  reached pretty much the red alert period this week. The federal hate bill, which I have
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  been warning about and you and other talk show hosts on alternative talk radio at least
[38:49.000 --> 38:55.000]  have been warning against, is now up for a vote next Thursday in the House of Representatives.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  Most people don't realize how serious this legislation is. They think, well, you know,
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  this is kind of an idealistic gesture to give homosexuals equality under the law and so
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  on. So what? I'm not going to criticize homosexuals anyway. But the truth of the matter is, this
[39:12.000 --> 39:19.000]  legislation has within it the power to actually indict pastors, talk show hosts, Christian
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  publishers, and so on. Now let's stop right there, because I want to get into this, but
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  you're an expert on this. You know more about the attacks on free speech than I do. You've
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  been there. You witnessed it. I've witnessed it too. But Ted, let's go. You've been saying
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  all this would happen again. It isn't just the Christians, but the liberals out there
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  that want us all arrested. I mean, explain to people what happened in Philadelphia. Now
[39:39.000 --> 39:47.000]  they can go see the video on your site, but explain to them how real this is. Yes. Several
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  years ago, actually it was 2004, I was on the radio a lot all summer and I led the charge
[39:54.000 --> 40:00.000]  to defeat the federal hate bill and it was stripped out in conference on October 10th.
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.000]  And the anti-defamation league was so furious about another defeat by the religious right
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.000]  that they commissioned their district attorney of Philadelphia, who is Lynn Abraham. She's
[40:12.000 --> 40:19.000]  a member of their national executive board. She had 11 Christians arrested for the so-called
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  hate crime of witnessing and singing a song on the street corner in Philadelphia during
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  a huge homosexual rally there. They were thrown in the justice department jail for 21 hours.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  Now of course this was all premeditated because the Christian group had announced they were
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  going to be there. This was all a precedent-setting case. Describe for those that can't see the
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  video online what happened. Yes, the police knew that the Christians were going to be
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.000]  there, but what they did was absolutely unprecedented in American history, especially in a city
[40:51.000 --> 40:58.000]  where freedom was founded in Philadelphia. They were sunk with seven charges, including
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.000]  a violation of the ADL's Pennsylvania hate crimes law, and it would have resulted in,
[41:05.000 --> 41:11.000]  as you said, a total of 47 years in prison and $90,000 fines each, including two grandmothers
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  and a 17-year-old girl. And basically that was a tremendous gift to me, really, because
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  it showed how desperate the anti-defamation league is. You see, that's what I've always
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  said, and the Bible says it, which even if you don't believe the Bible, folks, it's a
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  history book, that the persecution is our strength, isn't it? It's only going to make
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  us stronger. Well, we're within limits, but the fact of the matter is... Oh, I don't want
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  it to happen. I don't want to violate the first limit. I want to defeat them, but my
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.000]  point is, as they come against us, as they show us who they are, it's like Mike Rivero
[41:42.000 --> 41:48.000]  says, make a dictator act like a dictator. Well, that's true. Right now, the new right,
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  the evangelical right, which I am influencing to a great degree as well as the far right,
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  they are getting very much up in arms about this because they realize that this legislation
[41:58.000 --> 42:06.000]  has within it the ability to literally begin sending pastors to jail the day or two after
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.000]  President Bush may sign it, you see. And what I've been doing very recently is pointing
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.000]  out that most people don't realize that this hate bill is actually an elaborate amendment
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  to a hate crimes bill passed back in 1969. And they've also already sent pastors to jail
[42:23.000 --> 42:28.000]  in Germany, England, and Canada. And for those that don't know, Robin Page, we interviewed
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.000]  him four years ago, the host of One Man and His Dog, a rural affairs show where he walked
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.000]  from town to town each week. He was at a rural affairs meeting and said rural communities
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals. He was arrested, and they say the word homosexual
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  is illegal in England. Just type into Google, hundreds arrested in hate raids, BBC, and
[42:49.000 --> 42:56.000]  it will say that they have police all over restaurants listening for the word homosexual
[42:56.000 --> 43:01.000]  and you're arrested even for saying a scientific term like heterosexual, homosexual. So this
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  is literal 1984, and the exact people that got this passed in Europe and Canada are trying
[43:06.000 --> 43:14.000]  to pass it here. Absolutely. ADL passed their federal hate law in Canada in 1971, and as
[43:14.000 --> 43:20.000]  we know, they are setting up a huge 55-member nation hate crimes bureaucracy in Europe right
[43:20.000 --> 43:26.000]  now. They're attempting to unite the United States with all of these other Western industrialized
[43:26.000 --> 43:32.000]  countries in a huge internationally enforced hate crimes bureaucracy which will leap over
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.000]  national boundaries. And that's why it's tremendously important that all who love freedom right
[43:37.000 --> 43:43.000]  now call their House member and protest and just say please don't vote for any hate crimes
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  legislation. In fact, I'm telling people to stiffen what they're saying and say if
[43:48.000 --> 43:54.000]  you do vote for a hate crimes bill, I will never vote for you again. Now tell them the
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.000]  bill number, tell them exactly what it will do. Yes, the hate crimes bill before the House
[44:00.000 --> 44:08.000]  is H.R. 1592. Basically, it is a massive attempt by the federal government to break down all
[44:08.000 --> 44:14.000]  barriers to federal involvement in local policing. That's local law enforcement. Which
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  is another violation of the 10th Amendment, and I read the legislation not only, and they
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  have their Law Enforcement Assistance Act as well, and as you know, Reverend Mattel in
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.000]  the audience, it not only starts banning the First Amendment, it really totally federalizes
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.000]  our police, which are already quasi-federal. That's right. It also sets up a bias-oriented
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.000]  justice system which will run parallel to our English law. This is what they have in
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.000]  Canada, where you have old-fashioned English law where the police have to find some kind
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.000]  of probable cause of physical or demonstrable damage before an arrest can be made. But under
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  the bias system in Canada and under this legislation, the only criteria of guilt in a hate crimes
[44:56.000 --> 45:02.000]  charge will be whether members of a federally protected group, particularly Jews and homosexuals,
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.000]  can claim that their feelings have been hurt because of the so-called verbal violence of
[45:07.000 --> 45:13.000]  being criticized. You see, and what this does is it immediately makes pastors and talk show
[45:13.000 --> 45:19.000]  hosts like yourself and others indictable for holding up people to intimidation, saying,
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  for example, of homosexuals that because they have a higher rate of AIDS, they are not fit,
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.000]  perhaps, to be fixing your hamburger in the local deli, and things like that. You see,
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.000]  those were rights which were guaranteed to blacks under the Civil Rights Act of 1965.
[45:35.000 --> 45:43.000]  They've also said that you can't talk about how illegal aliens, over 7,000 cases of leprosy
[45:43.000 --> 45:49.000]  now a year, it was completely eradicated here until it showed up again in 2001, and now
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  7,000-plus cases a year, mainstream news, just type it into Google, 7,000-plus cases
[45:53.000 --> 45:58.000]  of leprosy will come up. You're not supposed to talk about drug-immune or highly-resistant,
[45:58.000 --> 46:03.000]  extreme drug-resistant TB spreading everywhere. You talk about that, you go to prison.
[46:03.000 --> 46:09.000]  That's right. You would be holding up Chicanos and so on to intimidating remarks, intimidating
[46:09.000 --> 46:15.000]  ideas which might cause them to feel like they weren't worthy of pursuing every possible
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  When in truth, we don't want Russians and Mexicans coming in with drug-resistant TB,
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.000]  and now it's spreading everywhere. They're locking people up who have it, but we can't
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  check it at the border.
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.000]  Yes. Well, the thing that's scary about this legislation is, you know, I have described
[46:29.000 --> 46:36.000]  this as requiring a good deal of adjustment and adjudication by judges after it was actually
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  passed, and that's been the pattern in Canada where the bill is passed and then it's given
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  to judges to broaden it to cover speech crimes as well as violent bias crimes. But the truth
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  of the matter is, this legislation is ready to go.
[46:51.000 --> 46:57.000]  Well, the point I'm trying to make, Ted Pike, is that they're already, without even a law,
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.000]  arresting people. I get videos every week now where they just walk up and go, I'm arresting
[47:01.000 --> 47:07.000]  you, and now the police say, you're a terrorist and arrest you. I mean, and laugh about it.
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.000]  I mean, I'm talking about snickering and giggling. I mean, I want the public to know it can happen
[47:12.000 --> 47:17.000]  and it is happening here. They're already running around foaming at the mouth arresting
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.000]  Christians and charging them with 47-year crimes. Kelly Rush, an upstanding member of
[47:22.000 --> 47:29.000]  the community, was in the newspaper in Lyon County, Kentucky, gave a Ron Paul video to
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  a police officer and they arrested him and charged him and it went to trial and he almost
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.000]  went to prison. Okay, folks, this isn't a joke and it isn't just Christians. They're
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  coming for us. Do you understand?
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.000]  Well, I'm hearing reports of the same thing, that the federal agents are involved in hate
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  crimes or arrests, even though they don't have jurisdiction at this moment. But what
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  this will do will be to legitimize it on the level, creating a massive hate crimes bureaucracy
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.000]  with all the authority and the prerogatives and the resources of the federal government
[48:03.000 --> 48:09.000]  to come down like Len Abraham did in Philadelphia, all over the nation at exactly the same time.
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  Can you imagine the local hate crime office? I mean, that is the actual commissariat. For
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  those that don't know, I was shocked a decade ago when I actually read Real Soviet History
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  and actually read Shelton Eason and actually found out that they called it hate crimes
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  then and hate speech and that that's what they would take you to the gulag for, was
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  criticizing the state. My God, Ted, people don't know.
[48:30.000 --> 48:36.000]  Well, actually, after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Lenin made it a capable crime in Russia
[48:36.000 --> 48:42.000]  to identify Jews as the architects of the revolution, of the commissars and so on. And
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.000]  that's pretty much the same situation today, really, where it's off-limits to use the sacred
[48:48.000 --> 48:54.000]  J word to describe ADL as the architects behind this legislation. But you know what, my website
[48:54.000 --> 49:03.000]  www.truthtellers.org, we have a link there to the ADL website where for 14 pages at ADL.org
[49:03.000 --> 49:10.000]  they describe how they have meticulously saddled 45 U.S. states now as a union with
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  hate crimes laws which are very capable. In case they can't pass the federal law, they
[49:15.000 --> 49:24.000]  can do the same thing. Well, you know it's the crown, the big jewel in the crown. Remember
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  like eight years ago, MTV for an entire day ran the names of people killed in hate crimes
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.000]  and said ban the First Amendment? I mean, when there's a national push like this that
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  never stops, you know it's because the New World Order has got to silence free speech
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  if they're going to be able to take this country down.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  That's right. Well, you know, we only have a couple of days now to protest in the House.
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  I'll be very blunt, it is overwhelmingly stacked against us with not only the Democrats in
[49:51.000 --> 49:57.000]  control, but literally there's 40 or 50 members of the House which we would have to convert
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  over, but we've got to just have literally a volcanic upheaval.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  Now, wait, with your help and your leadership, Ted, we've beaten this, what, the last seven
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  years in a row? Well, yes, we have beaten it. In fact, we defeated it three times in
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  the past two years, but this is a new agenda. Let me test my memory. Where do I get the
[50:14.000 --> 50:21.000]  number we've beaten in the last seven years? Well, you mean tell you how it happened?
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  I just remember interviewing you over the last seven years. Is that an accurate number?
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  Well, you haven't interviewed me over, but I've been fighting it since 1998 when the
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.000]  ADL first introduced it. No, I know that. I just remember, I'm just seeing my memories
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  failing me. Haven't they introduced this at least the last seven years, similar bills?
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  Yeah, off and on over the last seven years. It's been defeated about five times. They're
[50:43.000 --> 50:50.000]  very frustrated, but right now they have the numbers to pass the bill unless the American
[50:50.000 --> 50:56.000]  people speak out. But there has never, without any doubt, there has never been legislation
[50:56.000 --> 51:02.000]  as dangerous as H.R. 1592. It's called the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention
[51:02.000 --> 51:07.000]  act, which has now come through the house judiciary committee and be ready for Pelosi
[51:07.000 --> 51:15.000]  to introduce it next Thursday. Should the proper name be federalization of police and
[51:15.000 --> 51:20.000]  thought crime bureau? Well, I thought it should be called the local law enforcement
[51:20.000 --> 51:30.000]  hate crimes takeover act, something to that effect. It is a massive unification of state's
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  rights in law enforcement with federal... Stay there, Ted. Tell us about the bill on
[51:34.000 --> 51:42.000]  the other side. It's here after a year introduction and traveling to distant lands. My new film
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  Terror Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[51:52.000 --> 51:58.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took
[52:02.000 --> 52:08.000]  us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get

[52:49.000 --> 52:55.000]  Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites and harmful unwanted chemicals
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.000]  to below detectable levels. It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  smell of sulfide and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs. The Berkey Light
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant

[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized. An intruder
[53:41.000 --> 53:46.000]  has taken your personal possessions. Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking
[53:46.000 --> 53:51.000]  information and more all in the hands of a total stranger. What's worse is you realize
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.000]  he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked. Every time you walk away
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting

[54:41.000 --> 55:02.000]  Walker Haefecker joins us coming up in the next hour. Master beekeeper, just to cover
[55:02.000 --> 55:09.000]  all the scientific reports and information that he's been going over. He's also an advisor
[55:09.000 --> 55:15.000]  to some of the big international boards for the Germans. What's happening to the bees?
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  We'll see if we get him hooked up. It's always weird getting some money on from inside Europe
[55:19.000 --> 55:26.000]  with all the time zones and the language and all the rest of it. Reverend Ted Pike at truetellers.org
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  is our guest. Just in the last few minutes we've got left, Ted, get into the bill, get
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.000]  into how we fight it. Can we beat it in the Senate? Will we have to get states, like we've
[55:36.000 --> 55:41.000]  and other issues or the Patriot Act to say we're not going under federal control? I mean,
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  what do we do? Well, right now people have got to call, literally today they've got to
[55:45.000 --> 55:57.000]  call their house member from their district and the poll free number to Congress is 1-877-851-6437.
[55:57.000 --> 56:06.000]  Again, that poll free number, 877-851-6437. Just give them a simple message, please don't
[56:06.000 --> 56:13.000]  vote for any hate crimes legislation and if you do, I will never vote for you again. The
[56:13.000 --> 56:19.000]  situation is very grave in the House, but again, if there's a volcanic upheaval of protests
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  from the American people, things might change and these people who have gone over, especially
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  the Republicans, might realize that it is best, really at their best political advantage
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  to come back over and vote for the hate bill. In the Senate, the hearings will be going
[56:34.000 --> 56:43.000]  forward very soon. The Senate bill is in there, it's SB 1105 and it might have a more optimistic
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  chance there because, you see, you've got to have 60 members of the Senate in order
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.000]  to pass a bill. The ADL, I believe, has that number, maybe 61, but if we only persuade
[56:52.000 --> 57:00.000]  even 2 or 3 Republicans to come back to the fold, we can defeat the hate bill in the Senate.
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  So we're going to watch very closely what happens this Thursday immediately. We will
[57:05.000 --> 57:12.000]  be posting at TruthTellers.org the names of all the Republicans who have been turncoats
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.000]  and gone over to the pro-hate bill side and we will be blitzing them and calling for massive
[57:17.000 --> 57:23.000]  protests against them, argumentation coming to them next week.
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  Well, Ted, I think it's important that we restate here that when we call them, say the
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  hate crime bill but then add to them, we really know it's a federalization and thought crime
[57:33.000 --> 57:40.000]  bill and we're going to expose that. It's key to point out that the Patriot Act is not
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  the Patriot Act, that the hate bill is not a hate bill, that we've got plenty of laws
[57:44.000 --> 57:51.000]  in this country that this is about political persecution and free speech zones and arresting
[57:51.000 --> 57:57.000]  anybody and everybody that disagrees with anything that an administration is doing.
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  And the liberals have certainly seen Bush doing that and need to understand that this
[58:01.000 --> 58:06.000]  is about across the board attacks on free speech even if you don't agree with what Christians
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.000]  are saying or what pastors are doing. This is America. This is the First Amendment. You
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  better call your congressmen and women and your senators now.
[58:15.000 --> 58:22.000]  Yes, well actually I have a very powerful flyer at TruthTellers.org. It's called Anti-Hate
[58:22.000 --> 58:28.000]  Laws Will Make You a Criminal. It has powerful examples of how Christians and free speech
[58:28.000 --> 58:34.000]  advocates have been persecuted in countries like Canada and Europe and so on. Plus also
[58:34.000 --> 58:39.000]  very powerful arguments against the fallacies of hate crimes theory and so on. People should
[58:39.000 --> 58:46.000]  come to TruthTellers.org and print out that flyer, maybe about a dozen of them, and send
[58:46.000 --> 58:51.000]  those immediately, not only to your House member, but we list at TruthTellers.org the
[58:51.000 --> 58:57.000]  8 to 10 influential legislative aides that are at the elbow of every member of the House.
[58:57.000 --> 59:03.000]  Send them a copy of this flyer and there's still time. If you send it today it will be
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.000]  there Monday morning.
[59:04.000 --> 59:08.000]  I hear you Ted, we're out of time. I want to get you back on next week as this develops.
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.000]  Thank you so much.
[59:09.000 --> 59:10.000]  Thank you Alex.

[59:41.000 --> 59:46.000]  Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity

[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Honey bees all over the Western world are dying. Major university studies have shown
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  clear links between the pesticide produced corn, pharmacological crop, BT put out by
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Monsanto and the bees dying, and they believe a cocktail of other things add to that. But
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  that's the common thread. Yeah, it's designed to kill bugs that eat it, and the bees eat
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  the pollen and die. Wow, that's really hard to figure out, but they went and looked at
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  the bees' intestines and found that that is indeed it. And the government then promptly
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  said, all funding is cut off. Let's just let the bees die. Don't feel good and give some
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  money to a group that will set up a world tax on carbons. Let's not worry about dumping
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  toxic waste right in the oceans or overfishing or deforestation in the rainforest belts.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Anything that actually could have evidence showing it's a big problem. Or genetic engineering.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. You'd be thrown out of your tea drinking little coffee shop
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  where you mess with your dreadlocks and talk about the new tattoos you're getting. As a
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  phony environmentalist activist, if you did that, if you actually did something that mattered
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  to you. So you'll do what the big banks and oil companies are behind. We have all the
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  documents posted on prisonplanet.com right now. Paul did a big article about it today.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  How the oil companies run the whole phony global warming thing, and the peak oil fraud
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  and the rest of it. And of course, they'll probably win and get their global tax and
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  the continual destruction of the environment will accelerate. And it won't matter, you'll
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  just feel good about it and go follow the phony issues they tell you about. All right,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  I'm already getting a little bit smart mouth there. And nothing against dreadlocks or tattoos.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  There's some cool people that are like that. You know the phonies I'm talking about. Or
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  the little sandal liberals at your door. Give money to Greenpeace. It's for Earth. Give
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  money to Nature Conservancy. Give money to all corporate controlled. Before I come back
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  with our guest from Deutschland, I would like to encourage all of you to visit prisonplanet.com

[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  even try to get the word out here. Frankly, a lot of adversity many times. So we certainly
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  hope that you will support us at infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139. You

[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  remove chemicals such as triomethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  below detectable limits. Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  water into delicious crystal clear drinking water. Nitrates, nitrites, radon 222, unwanted
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem. Foul tastes like chlorine
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  that your body needs. Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  were carried out by British Intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  must see. Get your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling toll free

[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent? How about chlorides,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehyde, and more? Even fragrance can indicate the
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  and mucous membranes. Now compare a cow bin pure soap, all natural, earth friendly, no

[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  Police across America are arresting 9-11 truthers, they're arresting liberals, they're arresting
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  conservatives. There's no laws against free speech, but police and security guards run
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  up and say, you are a terrorist, he's got a bomb. By the way, in the Patriot Act, that's
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  10 years in prison. But again, it's all selectively enforced. If you or I did that, we'd go to
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  prison, and probably we should. Now that's coming up in the next hour with Luke Rudowski,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  and we're going to play that audio here on air of what happened in New York. It's unbelievable.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  For the next 30 minutes, I am joined from Germany with the individual who is cited as
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  one of the leading experts. He is an expert beekeeper, master beekeeper. He advises the
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  German government. He sits on the board of scientists and professors that have been looking
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  at this. It's really hard to go through his gigantic bio.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  March 22nd are GM crops killing bees, and it goes into how they have pharmacological
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  corn. They also have chemical corn. These biocrops is the proper name, and they actually
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  create pesticide in them so bugs won't eat them. But see, bees don't know that, and they
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  get the pollen. It's one of their favorite treats. There's a lot of pollen on the top
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  of a corn stalk as it's pollinated. Anybody that's ever been in a corn field, I mean,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  it's a bonanza. It's like an all-you-can-eat buffet or something compared to the amount
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  of pollen that bees get from other plants. Those little babies eat them, and they go
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  home and die. And it basically also, the major German studies, university studies, show it
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  strips out their intestines, then allows other bacteria and things to get through and kill
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  them. From the studies, but in the governments that have cut off the funding, they don't
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  like this coming out, it's one of the central causal effects. There's a cocktail of things.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  That's what all the scientists and experts are saying. My uncle's been a beekeeper for
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  a very long time. He's said many of these things for years. Over 70% now dead in Texas,
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  over 60% nationwide in the U.S. and Canada. Everywhere on the map, it's where this Monsanto
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  BT corn is being used. They're not dying in other areas of the world where chemicals
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  are still being used. It's this BT. But I'll shut up and bring up a guest who I really,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  really do appreciate coming on the air with us. And again, my friends, bees are responsible
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  for much of the food that we end up eating. And it is so vital that we get involved in
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  this and start exposing it. Walter Hefecker from Germany, is that the proper way to pronounce
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  your name, sir? Yeah, that's all right. Well, I mean, tell me, because I'm a dumb Texan,
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  how I pronounce it. It's Walter Hefecker. Hefecker? Yes. Okay, Hefecker, I've got it
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  now. And Walter will do just fine. Okay, well, we appreciate you coming on. Tell us
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  in a nutshell who you are, your years of study, what the scientific studies that you've edited
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  and contributed to have reported. Okay, well, I'm a professional beekeeper. I'm on the board
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  of directors of the German Professional Beekeepers Association. And I'm also a vice president
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  of the European Professional Beekeepers Association. And I've written a number of articles because
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  it's my job in both capacities to stay on top of the science in terms of what affects
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  the health of our bees, whether it's pesticides, whether it's genetically modified crops or
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  other changes in agriculture. You have to keep in mind that one beehive forages in an
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  area of several square miles. So you really have to take a look at everything that is
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  going on around you in agriculture and see whether it affects the health of your bees
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  or contaminates your bee products. So that's my assignment in both organizations. When
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  did you first start seeing a problem? When did the alarm bell first go off? Well, the
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  alarm bells have been going off here for a while, but the biggest year or the worst winter
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  that we had so far was the 2003-2004 winter where you saw a lot of colony losses throughout
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  Europe. It's not evenly distributed and also the reaction to it has been different in different
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  European countries. We were talking before you came on air and you agreed that from all
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  the evidence it's a cocktail, go through that cocktail and then break down the BT.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Basically what's happening is agricultural practices have changed in the last few decades
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  quite a bit and this change is accelerating. Of course you have larger and larger monocultures,
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  you have fewer and fewer foraging sources for the bees, but also in the last few years
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  you have a new generation of insecticides that are actually neurotoxins that seem to
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  have affected the bees quite a bit. In France the beekeeping association sued the manufacturer
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Bayer and BASF because of this and got a few of these insecticides off the market,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  at least for crops that are heavily visited by bees. In other parts of the world, including
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  Germany and the US, these chemicals are still heavily used. We are also seeing changes,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  especially in the US, where a new generation of genetically modified crops is very heavily
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  used and this generation of crops is producing a toxin, it's producing its own insecticide.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  In Europe we've been looking at the evidence and we've been fighting the government's
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  tooth and nail to make sure these crops are not grown and so far in the vast majority
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  of the European countries we've been successful and therefore we have colony losses due to
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  pesticides that are being used to spray crops or to treat seed due to ET crops. On the other
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  hand, there's quite a bit of evidence that what we've been wanting would happen if you
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  use a lot of ET crops is actually happening in the US right now.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  Walter, I've got a lot of different studies and articles and media reports here in front
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  of me but Europe's losses are only at 10 to 20, depending on whether it's Poland or Germany
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  with the numbers I have here, of what it is in the US and I've seen maps of where the
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  BT corn is being used in the US. Texas is one of the biggest, we have the worst losses
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  in bees. Can you tell us about the German study that was done of the BT corn and what
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  it's doing and then just on the face of it, why has it been approved for humans, a corn
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  that has a toxin in it and for those that don't know, this is one of the most popular
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  corns that we're all eating if you live in the US or Canada right now and it's also
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  infected most other corn strains. Understand, you can't put this genie back in the bottle.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  This is a very aggressive corn that is now getting into the seed stocks of every other
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  major seed variety. Yes, well it's contaminated the native corn species in Mexico. If you
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  have other corn, other plants that are relatives of corn planted in the area, you're going
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  to get contamination. The reason this has been approved as a food item and also as animal
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  feed is because industry is claiming that these plants are producing a toxin that also
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  occurs naturally. Even organic farmers in Germany and all over Europe are using the
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:30.240]  natural form of this toxin but research in Brussels by a scientist from Switzerland has
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:37.440]  clearly demonstrated that the BT toxin produced by these plants is not the same that occurs
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:46.840]  naturally and does not involve the same safeguards that the natural product has. There's actually
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:54.560]  two hurdles that the natural toxin normally has to clear before it becomes active. The
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:05.560]  toxin produced by BT crops produces the active form directly and therefore it affects many
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:13.760]  more organisms than the natural one does. Walter, we always hear this argument. People
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:19.660]  say it's natural. You can go out and get nightshade off the side of the road in Texas and if you
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:24.160]  eat two leaves of it, you're going to have a heart attack and die. Jumping off a cliff,
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.960]  the rocks at the bottom are natural. This is not natural. In the natural world you've
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.160]  got buffers, you've got funguses that grow that are meant to block bugs but exactly you
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:40.160]  soup one up, you make it to where it immediately activates and it's grown in the corn. The
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.960]  people are going to be eating. This isn't fungus on the outside, this is fungus on the
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:51.660]  inside. That's one of the major problems of genetically modified crops. If they produce
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:57.160]  an insecticide, they produce it all day long, they produce it in every part of the plant
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:02.660]  and you can't wash it off. But that's their incredible spin. They go, well, we took a
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:07.860]  fungus that helps plants and we put it in the plant. That's not natural. It's killing
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:11.860]  the bees. Stay there, Walter. We really appreciate you joining us. I want to talk about solutions
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:17.060]  to this and if there's any indicator that Monsanto is going to turn back and the answer
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:23.260]  of course will probably be no. It's just off the charts, ladies and gentlemen. Understand
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:26.860]  this is one of the most popular corns. You eat this every week, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:31.260]  It's in everything. Corn is used as a big filler and it's got toxin in it and the guy
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:37.060]  they don't care. I love the new sandal styles but before I discovered Nonix nail gel, I
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:41.560]  was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them. If your nails look dark or discolored,
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:46.360]  now there's a solution besides hiding them. It's a patented nail gel called Nonix. All
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:50.960]  natural Nonix clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:57.160]  builds up under nails called keratin debris. Nonix nail gel is absolutely amazing. My toenails
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:01.960]  now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore. Nonix nail gel removes
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:07.660]  yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:14.260]  clarity. It's also money back guaranteed. You'll find Nonix gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:20.660]  the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade and independent
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:27.660]  pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com. Nonix nail gel for clearer nails and feet
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:36.260]  that look great in sandals. Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. April 26, 2007, spot
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:42.760]  gold 67570 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $696.66, $350.72 for half ounce
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:49.760]  and $175.39 for quarter ounce coins at $696.66, $350.72 and $175.39. There has been talk coming
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.460]  from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:22:00.260]  and the U.S. and erasing economic borders. Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico,
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:04.760]  Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership. The
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:09.360]  formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S. economy. Jerome
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:14.660]  R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emeril. The sovereignty
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:20.660]  of the U.S. is under attack and Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.

[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:42.160]  during an accident? During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:47.260]  into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body. Medical Corps' potassium
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:52.560]  iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.860]  accident, radioactive poisoning. Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:03.500]  by filling the thyroid with good iodine. This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:09.040]  the harmful radioactive iodine. Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:15.000]  it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.800]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:42.100]  glass? Well, the glass has a natural resonance. If the resonant frequency force making the
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:46.200]  glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:50.700]  shatters. Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:55.240]  can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies. The BioSolutions frequency instrument
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:00.440]  uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side

[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:37.440]  Walter Hayfacker is our guest. He is on the big national and international board for beekeepers
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.820]  and he's confirmed with a bunch of top scientists, university professors and others have put
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:58.320]  together several big reports. It's been picked up by their Spiegel and others. And we have
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.640]  similar reports out of universities here in the United States finding that this, wow,
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:09.640]  really surprising, a corn that grows its own pesticide so bugs don't eat it, the little
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:15.160]  bees don't know and they die. Man, that's really a hard connection. And by the way,
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.520]  we've had Nobel Prize winners on, as you know, top scientists telling you that they were
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.960]  making millions a year living in the house on the hill. We've had a bunch of them on
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.840]  and it's always the same story and they would give the new potato to the rats and half the
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.720]  rats would die in record time, the others would have mutations that they thought could
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.620]  only happen in the womb, suddenly intestines three times their size or other rats would
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:41.600]  shrivel up and die and they just approve that potato and then they're putting cockroach
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:48.200]  genes and salmon genes in the corn and spider genes in pigs and a human gene in the pig
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.240]  and then getting a heart out of the pig and it's giving rise to random deadly viruses
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:58.760]  and it's just spreading all over and no one seems to care. Walter, this is like a bad
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:05.760]  science fiction movie. Yes, it is. But actually people in Europe care quite a bit. All the
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:13.160]  polls are showing that the majority of the people don't want this stuff. You have regions
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:20.160]  declaring themselves GMO free. We have whole countries like Greece or Bulgaria, Hungary
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:29.960]  Poland, Austria all declaring themselves GMO free. Can I stop you? But the WTO says you
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:36.700]  can't do that. It's an unfair trade barrier if you don't let this stuff in. And again
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:41.300]  that's the global government levying billions of fines per company. I mean going back ten
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:47.400]  years ago the French burned down when they tried to ship in the GMO crops. So the people
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.240]  are resisting and I'm an American, I'm proud to be an American, but Walter why do you think
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:57.680]  Americans are on average not as aggressive, not one tenth as aggressive as Europeans on
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:04.680]  this key issue? What's wrong with us? Actually I used to live in California when this GM
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:12.960]  tomato was launched and I remember the whole thing was done very cleverly. Industry was
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:20.120]  successful in avoiding any labeling so Americans have no idea that they're eating a whole bunch
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:27.320]  of this stuff. In Europe if it contains GM material it has to be labeled and there's
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.880]  no supermarket that carries any GM product because they know they would have such a consumer
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:42.280]  backlash but it was very cleverly done. Most people have no idea what they're eating and
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:49.280]  as far as industry is concerned that's just the way they want it. You have major corporations
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.920]  and if you look at the Bush administration, the people that are not from the oil business
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:02.920]  are from Monsanto. If you download from the White House website the national security
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:09.920]  strategy of the United States you'll actually find a paragraph in there on how important
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.840]  it is to get rid of the resistance to new technology, euphemism, in Europe.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:23.840]  Now let me just go back here because think about it Americans, you're not allowed to
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.800]  know and they've federally blocked you knowing when you're eating GMO, they've tried to destroy
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:39.960]  the other labels where private groups would try to label it themselves to where now it
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.400]  can be 75% altered and you're not told. That's because they know we don't want it so they
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.000]  criminally use the government to block us from learning. Walter, what are we going to
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.440]  do without our bees? What do you see happening in the Americas with the bees dying en masse,
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.160]  I'm in the center of it here in Texas, as a master beekeeper? How is this going to affect
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:08.160]  the biosphere and the food chain? Basically, bees are a bioindicator because
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:15.160]  obviously there are tons of insects but the honey bee is the insect that is commercially
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:22.720]  used to produce honey and to provide pollination service. So it's always on the radar screen
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:28.460]  and what you see happening with the bees is an indication that something is seriously
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:35.460]  wrong in the environment. We have many of the same problems in Europe because it's not
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:43.620]  just BT crops, it's also this new generation of insecticides and it's also a new generation
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:51.680]  of very intensive agricultural practices. So if this is allowed to continue, you're
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:58.680]  going to have these types of losses every year. Actually, I was back in the States in
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:05.880]  California in 2004 and back then people were telling me, hey, our bees are disappearing.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:12.640]  We got a break. Walter, we got a break. Stay there. One more segment with him. This is
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.680]  really important info. It's got me concerned. But instead we'll have a global tax on carbon
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:24.680]  fuels. Does absolutely nothing to help us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:33.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:39.960]  self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants,
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.760]  flowers and herbs. It's called Protogrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.900]  growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:52.600]  and light conditions. Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.240]  Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.560]  increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time. Protogrow works by
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.620]  providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.220]  uptake in plants. Protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.940]  with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value. And if you want to
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:16.140]  double or triple the potency of herbs or wheat grass, you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:20.220]  superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy. GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:26.100]  superfoods should visit the Protogrow website at growlikecrazy.com. That's www.growlikecrazy.com
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:33.100]  or call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. This is Elizabeth Border. News alert. Twice

[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:34.060]  write to PO Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609. It's a fact. You can legally eliminate credit
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:39.780]  card debt which has been fraudulently created by the banks. Since its creation in 1913,
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:44.780]  the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt. So why should you, the hardworking
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:49.040]  American, be harassed for yours? There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.180]  for debt and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:58.020]  when needed. Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:02.080]  want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors. This is not
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:07.700]  a debt consolidation company. Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:12.980]  because they've legally eliminated their credit card debt. Instead of living each day in fear,
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:18.620]  it's time to turn your life around. Call Day of Jubilee, open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central
[01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:25.620]  Standard Time at 920-293-8024. That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert. Don't wait any longer
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:36.380]  to get your life back in order.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:55.620]  There's no debating it. It's the cover of the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times.
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:17.020]  Oh yeah, 70% of the bees are dead in Texas and over 60% nationwide and that's even with
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:20.520]  whitewash numbers. I don't see bees anymore. I used to see them everywhere. Any flower
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:25.020]  you saw, any big bush with flowers, cover of little bees, you don't see them. The pollen
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:29.460]  just builds up in big piles all over the streets. Everyone who never had allergies now has them
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:34.060]  because of increased pollen and there's literally, I mean I don't know how many studies I've
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:40.220]  read, hundreds I've seen, dozens I've read with and conclusively and every major medical
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:46.140]  doctor, allergist, and I've now been to one, will tell you, yeah, it's the GMO pollens,
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:50.300]  hundreds of them. They're all flying around in growth belts and if you live in an agriculture
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:54.420]  area you're really in trouble, especially Texas and you're just breathing all these
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:59.900]  new pollens that have bacteria and cockroach. Cockroach is such an old species. For some
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:04.140]  reason it's the favorite. It's in hundreds of things now. You think I'm kidding, go look
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:09.800]  it up and you've got weird insect genes in the pollen. Your body freaks out. Your body
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:16.060]  goes, what is this? This is stuff that's never existed before. The potatoes and these corns
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:23.140]  and other things have amino acids that never existed before so it's toxic in your stomach.
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:26.660]  Massive studies on that, again killing the guinea pigs and rats. It's total pull your
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:31.100]  hair out, scream, freak out, but we're not. We're just going to calmly keep gobbling,
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.020]  keep eating. Everyone I know literally has snot running out of their nose and is sick
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:40.660]  with swollen eyeballs year round and has huge headaches and these are people that run triathlons.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:44.240]  These are people who've never had allergies. These are people who are healthy. It's just
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.560]  everywhere now, cold medicines everywhere, allergy medicines everywhere and all the studies
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:53.440]  say it's the GMO pollen. Whereas it kills bees, it makes us real sick because you know
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.240]  we're a lot bigger and a lot stronger. We're not a little honey bee and they're not going
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.920]  to stop there. They're the government. They're going to keep snatching our children with
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:04.760]  a CPS and keep raising all the taxes and go after our guns and do all these things to
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:11.480]  us and feed us poison. Going back, I mean it just makes me so angry going back to the
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.200]  German master beekeeper who heads up the national organization as the vice president
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.520]  of the European organization with all these scientists and professors that have studied
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:23.320]  this. Where does it go, number one, sir, and then number two, the evidence is in these
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.720]  things are toxic to all forms of life and are causing serious problems. Top scientists
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:33.840]  are saying you could give rise to super viruses that could cause mega death any minute. The
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.880]  stuff we've seen has just been a prelude. What are the top scientists and professors
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:42.200]  you confer with? What's their greatest fear? Where do they see this going? What could this
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:52.200]  do with colony collapse, not just in the cultivated bees but in the wild bee species? Yes, basically
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:37:00.800]  if you lose the pollinators, you lose the basis for human nutrition. There are so many
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:07.640]  plants that depend on bees. There's so much stuff that livestock is raised on that depends
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:14.840]  on pollination by bees. You simply cannot afford to lose the bees. If the government
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:21.200]  doesn't do anything, people have to get going. What we're doing here, number one, is we're
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:30.520]  buying organic food. Stop supporting GM crops by simply not buying them. Second, a lot of
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:36.560]  people get together and declare their county. Together consumers, farmers, beekeepers declare
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:44.040]  their county GMO-free. I know this has happened in Mendocino County in California. It has
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:49.440]  been attempted in Sonoma County. I'm not totally up to speed. Whatever else in the U.S., people
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:55.320]  are doing it. You simply have to stop buying the stuff and you have to work with your farmers
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.880]  to make sure they don't use it. I don't think there's a lot of chance that you can convince
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:10.080]  the government to take this off the market because these crops, what's very interesting
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:16.200]  about them, they're all patented. These companies are making big bucks because they're not selling
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:22.520]  the seed for the farmer to replant. They're selling it. They're licensing the GM seed
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:30.160]  as a patented crop. This is creating a new dependency for farmers and we simply have
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:36.320]  to pull the rug out of under them. Walter, the big problem I see, and this is main line
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:41.480]  genetic engineers, this is the consensus. I know you've done your research and you've
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:47.760]  seen the same thing, but add or subtract. Make your point on this because I want to
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:54.520]  get your take on what I'm trying to say. Now the cross species hybridization where they
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:00.760]  take a bug gene and put it in a mammal and then put it in a fish and then put it in a
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:05.080]  reptile and then put it in a plant so it will then encapsulate into the genetic code of
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:10.760]  another plant. I mean we're talking 30, 40, 50 steps now where it will get the one genetic
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.000]  change they want, you know, give you a tomato that doesn't rot for a month and a half, but
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:22.080]  each genetic change could give thousands of random recombinants each time it is subsequently
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:27.560]  planted, thousands of random changes and they admit it's already like the pig human
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:32.920]  splices has already given in the laboratory rise to super viruses that's been scooped
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.460]  up and sold to bio weapons companies. I mean I don't think the public realizes we're already
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:42.840]  so far gone, I don't think people realize, I mean can you talk to the, I mean if just
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:50.200]  a pesticide corn is causing this, imagine you talk about what the wild cross species,
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:57.160]  you know jelly fish in a rhesus monkey, in a fish, in a turkey, in a corn plant, I mean
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.720]  where is this going? With Bt crops you're already talking about cross species because
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:08.920]  they've taken the genes from a bacterium and put it in a plant. The problem is that the
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:13.100]  more of the stuff you do and the industry is talking about stacked traits where they
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:20.100]  do several of these changes in a single plant and the more you do with this the more common
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:30.000]  complex it is to have any idea what is happening in there and it's like software with plants
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.560]  and you have a PC and you know it's crashing constantly and software engineering is a very
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:44.280]  precise science compared to manipulating genes in a plant and in the software industry there's
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:50.960]  a rule that software without bugs is obsolete and unfortunately in the current economic
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:56.520]  environment the same rule applies for genetically modified crops, they don't take the time to
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:01.160]  test it, if other people are testing it and they're finding problems they're trying to
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:06.880]  figure out ways to remove the funding, make sure they shut up so that the business model
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:12.120]  doesn't get interfered with and this is a very, this is a recipe for disaster.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:18.520]  Well it's not a recipe for disaster, the disasters are already legion and I want listeners to think
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:24.160]  about this for a minute, like it's an open air laboratory, they are openly planning all this,
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:28.640]  I always use the example of four years ago Texas company Protegene typed in the words
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:37.880]  Protegene HIV corn and it was live HIV, pharmacological corn growing live in over
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:44.040]  90 locations from Texas to Nebraska, it got out folks and now it's just out and they had
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:49.320]  guys in weird suits, that's why it broke in the Associated Press running around with literal
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.880]  black helicopters folks flying around burning fields okay and then this came out in the news,
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:01.520]  okay they're doing stuff like that everywhere, no controls, what is wrong with these CEOs sir?
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:03.040]  What is the problem?
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.320]  Well one thing is wrong is they have no idea about bees because they think if they plant
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:13.920]  something on one field nothing will happen to the neighboring fields but for the bees
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:20.600]  there is no difference, they cover both, their crops pollinate both, also if they're planting
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:28.480]  crops the new thing is now farmer crops, so crops that are genetically modified to produce
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:36.640]  pharmaceutical substances, now if this is done in an open field there can be bees flying
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:42.200]  over there from several miles away harvesting the stuff and the unsuspecting beekeeper now
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:48.920]  has a pharmaceutical in his honey, you know this is complete insanity to do this on an
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:54.840]  open field, they can do in their lab whatever they want but in an open field there's the
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.680]  wind, there's the bees and you can't put that genie back in the bottle.
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.480]  I got to say I disagree with you unless it's a level 4 when they're doing cross species
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:10.160]  this needs to be underground in sealed facilities because again all the top scientists I've
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:16.320]  interviewed and the science is out they always thought 96% of genetics across plant animal
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:22.600]  didn't matter was junk, it's not junk, it's what gives us our flexibility as life on this
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:27.320]  planet, it's kind of like a giant wheel of fortune, every time an egg and a sperm meet,
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:32.400]  every time pollen meets another plant it randomly spins with different traits and when they
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:39.320]  change one genetic trait it changes thousands of others randomly, that 96% was more important
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:46.080]  than the quote active 4%, the 4% was only the levers that gave them limited access into
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:51.800]  the 96%, there's no way to control it and as you said it's like the world's a giant
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:57.760]  computer and these guys are randomly in there just jamming screwdrivers in it and pouring
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:03.480]  water on it and just messing with it, this is insane, it's already causing massive problems.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:11.480]  Yeah you're absolutely right, the marketing brochures make it sound like it's a very precise
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:21.480]  act but what they're actually doing is they're shooting in fragments of genetic code with
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:27.320]  a so called gene gun with gold pallets and then they grow a whole bunch of these plants
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:34.400]  and out of thousands of plants just a few may have what they're looking for, think about
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:46.000]  trying to, you have a bunch of letters, documents on your hard drive, try editing that document
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:53.440]  by randomly shooting data on your hard drive, it's crazy.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.600]  It's unbelievable, folks you understand that they can get the one change they want after
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:05.520]  thousands of tests but to get that one change it totally changes over, on average the scientists
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.560]  have said over a thousand other traits and then they go out and openly plant that and
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:15.520]  then it's going to mutate further and it's already causing huge problems.
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:23.640]  That's right, so as bee keepers all over the world we're very much opposed to it.
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.680]  In Europe they're trying to sell us the concept of coexistence meaning if you want to grow
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:36.880]  GM stuff fine, if you don't want to grow GM crops that should be possible also.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:43.360]  In reality this doesn't work, once somebody starts growing GM crops he will contaminate
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:52.600]  the neighbors until you have people that want to grow GM crops and people that grow
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:55.840]  GM crops even though they don't want it.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.720]  You probably know the case of Percy Schmeiser in Canada.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:06.040]  Let me go back though here, number one birds, number two the bees, the other insects all
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:10.200]  move it from field to field so it's like it's a liberal thing, oh you're not racist it's
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:17.920]  coexistence, now we've caught Monsanto planting canola right next to other fields to contaminate
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:23.080]  they then go grab a few plants out of yours that they contaminated, they then sue you
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:28.760]  that's total mafia and they know that the wind and the bees and the birds are going
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.640]  to move this by design, they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.920]  Well it's actually using contamination as a marketing tool, the wind and the bees carry
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:43.920]  it over to the neighbors field, the stuff is patented, they say you're using our patents
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:49.120]  it doesn't matter how you got them and you now owe us money or you signed this contract
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:53.720]  and you use our stuff, that's how it's going to be successful.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.920]  Let me add Monsanto pioneered all this 30, 40 years ago so they literally got the laws
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.980]  written in the US that they've gotten adopted internationally where understand it'd be like
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:07.440]  if I came over to your house and put cyanide in your drink and you died and then I sued
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:14.440]  your family saying that I patented cyanide so I'm going to sue you for stealing my cyanide,
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:21.240]  they infect you and then you go to their St. Louis court that Monsanto literally runs and
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.480]  then they take your property.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:29.800]  Yeah I mean we had a member of the board of directors of the American Kongwars Association
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:36.800]  here in Europe warning us that he gave presentation to German farmers and said look at what happened
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:42.880]  to us, we're stuck, in Europe you still have a choice because the consumers are backing
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:49.760]  you and fighting the stuff and so they went through several city tours and told everybody
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:53.600]  don't get started with us otherwise you're going to be in the same bad spot that we're
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:54.600]  in.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:48:00.160]  Let me ask you a question, what is wrong with the elites of this planet that they're endangering
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.760]  their children and grandchildren's futures, I mean this is insane.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:16.240]  Well this is a philosophical question, what you have here is corporations, shareholders
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:22.880]  that say I want X percent return on my money, get it however you want to and the problem
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:33.560]  is look at how Monsanto stock has performed from a shareholder, a company that is getting
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:39.160]  this kind of lock on the seed market has been a pretty good bet.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:44.040]  What do you think is going to happen in the U.S. when we have massive crop failures due
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:48.560]  to honeybee eradication?
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.880]  I think it's very interesting because you have the financial interest of the seed companies
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:49:03.520]  that are pushing GM crops colliding with everybody else that wants pollination so it's in the
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:04.520]  U.S.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:09.720]  In Europe we have the problem that we are saying this could be a possibility but luckily
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:18.180]  nobody grew it so the government could safely ignore it but the problem in the U.S. now
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:25.320]  is so severe and it's costing billions in losses in agriculture that you cannot afford
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:30.320]  not to do the science and see where the causes are.
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:38.880]  They cannot afford to look away anymore and so this is the good thing that may come out
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:46.360]  of it finally after all the scientists that have said there could be a problem here have
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.520]  been sidelined and now there is an interest in their work because you simply cannot afford
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:52.760]  not to solve this problem.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:56.520]  Walter, I want you to give out any websites or places where people can get more information
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.520]  because we are out of time.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:09.880]  Where you should go, well most of the websites are in German but it's EPBA which is European
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:18.720]  Professional Beekeepers Association.org, check that out and you will find more information
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.720]  on this.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:22.800]  Well we have links up to you on Infowars.com.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.280]  Godspeed my friend and I hope to talk to you again in the next year or so as this develops
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:32.240]  and we appreciate sane people like yourself and the scientists and professors you are
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:34.360]  working for trying to stop this nightmare.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.360]  God bless.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:36.720]  All right, take care now.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:40.960]  Have a good evening with your family in Germany, he was there in his living room with his family
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:44.160]  doing the interview via cordless phone.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.520]  Well folks I've studied this and again I don't want to cut down the rain forest.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.680]  I don't want because there once you cut it down it's very hard for it to come back.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.000]  Here in the U.S. the way our topography and landscapes are it's fine to cut it down as
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.400]  it does come back.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.880]  I don't but that's nothing compared to dumping toxic waste in the oceans and genetic engineering
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:04.120]  and all this stuff.
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.760]  When you hear about global warming it's a total fraud and a lie.
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:11.160]  It's about a global tax, okay, in that period.
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:15.040]  But again they can't have real environmentalists out there involved in real issues.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:19.640]  So the global warming thing isn't even so much about a global tax as it is sucking up
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:26.520]  all your activist energies so that you're not involved in serious issues like the genetic
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:32.600]  engineering which I cannot express how dangerous it is.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:40.480]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands my new film Terror Storm
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.480]  is complete.
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:45.200]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:50.040]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:55.240]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.480]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:01.480]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:07.800]  to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:09.240]  and much, much more.
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:13.040]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.440]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:19.760]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:38.000]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks, anthrax
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.400]  and to top it all off duct tape and plastic, alarming words for our time.
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.240]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:49.480]  The video sheltering in place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:54.360]  and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:59.240]  as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases and has worked as a nuclear specialist
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:00.600]  for the U.S. government.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.560]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.

[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:08.360]  your home as a shelter.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:12.520]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late then you need the video sheltering
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.520]  in place.

[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:38.040]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:43.320]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards,
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:47.160]  banking information and more all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:52.320]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:55.960]  Every time you walk away from your computer leaving your internet connection on you are
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:01.000]  virtually inviting hackers, criminals and big brother to access your personal information.

[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:11.960]  this is not America, will die for the system, blossom fields bloom the season, promise not
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:21.560]  to be scared yet, because I'm not trying to scare you for scaring's purpose just for the
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:23.160]  sake of it.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:27.960]  I'm concerned, I want to get you concerned, not scared.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.800]  I mean what does it say about an elite, I'm going to say this again, that over a year
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:40.040]  ago now, I was in the Chicago Tribune twice and other major papers, and the headline was,
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:48.520]  what was it, something like white slavery, rings, have lobbyists on Capitol Hill, I ought
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:51.040]  to go re-pull that article, I'll talk about it so much I should read it again, there were
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:52.040]  two of them.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.040]  Another one was governor speaks out against dying core human trafficking, or was it Halliburton
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:01.280]  human trafficking, it had both of them in the article, and it said that the, folks they're
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.760]  kidnapping people worldwide, ok, they've been caught in Europe, Middle East, all over, guaranteed
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:10.520]  they're doing it here, do you think they just, again I know there's a lot of you out there
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:15.880]  doing it for the first time, and you think, oh this guy's nuts, that isn't going on, do
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:20.400]  you think they just let me get on the radio, do you think they wouldn't sue me in 10 seconds,
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:25.320]  it's true, ok, now I have gotten little phone calls that I'll be dead if I don't shut up,
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:28.320]  well that doesn't make me talk about it more, that's why I mention it every two days or
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.320]  so.
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:34.120]  How could you not, we have a government, with dying core and Halliburton and others, that
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:37.640]  since the early 90's, dying core's been getting caught, they've changed their name, they're
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:43.420]  based right here in Austin, who run around, literally kidnapping women and children, selling
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:50.760]  them into white slavery, sex rings, sweatshops, folks they take Europeans to Asia, nobody
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:55.640]  seems to care about the image of brown people enslaved, tied, chained to sewing machines,
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:00.480]  but no, no, no, no, no, they take little 10 year old white girls, does that get you upset?
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:05.200]  Again, I'm not being racist here, I'm upset by everybody being slaves, but the point is,
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:09.360]  I mean this is, you're not going to hear Jesse Jackson whine about those white girls though
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.800]  are you?
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:15.200]  This is how aura about little black kids being killed in pesticide tests, which we've covered,
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:20.640]  which has been in the mainstream news, but just a little blurb, you see, no, they'll
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.360]  talk about some gay guy that got beat up by some ne'er do wells, you know, and so let's
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:30.720]  ban free speech for this guy, they don't care about that guy who got beaten to death, they
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.920]  want to take everybody's free speech so we can't criticize Monsanto, so we can't go out
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:38.440]  and say 9-11's an inside job.
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:45.080]  I mean do you feel safe when you've got an elite who is crazy, I see Bill Clinton on
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:50.480]  TV drinking Diet Cokes, everybody knows Aspartame's deadly, he drinks it, I know that the elites
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:54.320]  the Rockefellers and Rothschilds if you read about them in mainstream articles are obsessed
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.120]  with organic food and their own water filters and they know, but it's only that very tip
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:03.600]  top, most of these CEOs, most of these even high level people, they don't even see the
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:08.680]  big picture, it's a very small group that do, maybe a thousand people on their end,
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:14.800]  there's now millions of, there's now millions of us that see the big picture.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:22.280]  And so I'm freaked out, I mean this is hundreds of major studies, ladies and gentlemen, admitting
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:28.800]  that they have corn with pesticide, potatoes with new amino acids, most of the GMO brands,
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:37.800]  all toxic, it's just, it's in everything, I mean they don't care, they're crazy, and
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:43.600]  they've got their kids eating it, these CEOs who are making 50 million, 100 million a year,
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:48.600]  their little kid goes and eats it too, I don't understand it, what is wrong with people?
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:54.720]  How does Dine Corps and Halliburton run around kidnapping millions, that's the numbers, millions
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:59:01.360]  of people in the last 10 years alone, and nothing happens, I mean, oh man, we're in
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:08.200]  so much trouble folks, we're in so much trouble, that's just a few examples, TV stars, you
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:12.680]  know, torture people every episode, I mean, this is what we turned into.

[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:38.180]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:39.180]  You want answers?
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:41.300]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:50.620]  All right.
[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:55.180]  I'm going to get into the economy right now, and then we've got Marty Shacker coming up
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:59.900]  for five minutes, then Luke Badowski on the attack on the First Amendment.
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:03.700]  It's all coming up, and when Luke's home, I'm going to try to take some phone calls.
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:05.420]  I'm going to play the audio.
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:09.960]  It was able to get it to us without music over it, so it's a lot easier to hear.
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:13.660]  And you will hear the Silverstein security people in plain clothes, and I mean, these
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:21.940]  guys outdo, literally, you've got to see the video of it up on prisonplanet.com, literally
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:24.500]  outdo people out of the Goodfellas.
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:31.060]  In fact, I'll check and make sure that's reposted on the main page, but Luke will be joining
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:32.060]  us.
[02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:34.320]  We will be playing that audio.
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:37.560]  As they call him a terrorist and say he's got a bomb.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:38.560]  That's a bomb.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.560]  He's got a bomb.
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:40.560]  So illegal.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:46.080]  In fact, I ought to go pull Patriot Act One.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:54.360]  It's got, memory serves, $100,000 fine, 10 years in prison for claiming there is a bomb
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:59.840]  when there's not a bomb, or making a false report.
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.280]  By the way, that is terrorism.
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:09.640]  When you say somebody's got a bomb, and Luke's so polite to them, Luke's so polite, they
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:16.080]  walk over, and he goes, take that camera off me, and Luke goes, no, I don't mean to disrespect,
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:22.640]  I'm just videotaping here, and the guy's so dumb, he thinks, he goes, why are you disrespecting
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:23.640]  me?
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:29.120]  Man, I'm just telling you, I don't think I can handle any more mafia types sticking their
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:31.280]  fat nose in my life, man, other people's.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:34.200]  I'm just so sick of you people thinking you can push us around.
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:35.360]  All we want is freedom.
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:39.360]  All we want to do is live our lives without you like a bunch of fat hogs sitting on top
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.680]  of us, sucking off on us.
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:44.280]  We only have to worship you through the culture and the television when you're a bunch of
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.720]  greasy filth.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:49.720]  All right, reconnect with me.
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:50.720]  My SDN's down.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.280]  We'll be right back.
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:06.280]  Well, I won't back down.
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.280]  No, I won't back down.
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:19.280]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:23.280]  No, I won't stand my ground.
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.280]  I won't be turned around.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:31.280]  And I'll keep this world from dragging me down.
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.280]  Gonna stand my ground.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:39.280]  And I won't back down.
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:40.280]  I won't back down.
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:48.280]  Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out.
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:57.280]  Hey, I won't stand my ground.
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.280]  And I won't back down.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:05.280]  Well, I know what's right.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:14.280]  I got just one line in a world that keeps on pushing me around.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:18.280]  But I'll stand my ground.
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:19.280]  And I won't back down.
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:22.280]  All right, connection with me in Minnesota.
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:24.280]  Good, the torture of everything.
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:32.280]  I just, I don't even know what I was talking about there earlier before that happened.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:37.280]  Oh, by the way, some idiot, last time I called some corrupt mafia person a greasy piece of
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.280]  filth, they go, why don't you like Italians?
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:45.280]  I don't have anything against Italians, you idiot.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.280]  I call anybody who's corrupt oily and greasy in a dirt bag.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:55.280]  But again, everyone's conditioned in the double think Soviet America that any time you talk
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:02.280]  about corruption to bring in race or ethnicity or sexual preference as some way to neutralize
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.280]  the debate.
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:06.280]  It's like when I caught black guys getting paid off to give a false testimony over the
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:08.280]  Texas legislature.
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:11.280]  And the paper called me and said, those are black men, are you racist?
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:14.280]  And they said, if they were white, would you have reported this?
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:15.280]  And I said, what?
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:21.280]  I'm saying cops acting like gangsters are dirt bag grease balls.
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:22.280]  Okay?
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:26.280]  Because I say mafia, they want to tie it into some Italian connection.
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.280]  You're the racist.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:35.280]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:37.280]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:41.280]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:45.280]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:51.280]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:53.280]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:57.280]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:03.280]  to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information,
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:05.280]  and much, much more.
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:09.280]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:11.280]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:15.280]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:52.280]  was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health,

[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:02.280]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step by step through the process
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:04.280]  of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:09.280]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:31.280]  Auto makers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:34.280]  Auto makers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:37.280]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:41.280]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.

[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:15.280]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:26.280]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:34.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network promptly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:37.280]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:59.280]  Music
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:01.280]  All right, he was up with us last week.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.280]  Another little visit with us now.
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:05.280]  I'm going to get into the attack on free speech in America.
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:08.280]  If I could stay connected from Texas to Minnesota.
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:14.280]  Right now, let's go to Marty Schachter of Cal-Bend Pure Soap.
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:16.280]  American-made, 60 years.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.280]  They have their 60th anniversary this year, and it is organic.
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:26.280]  American-made soap with no detergents, no petrochemicals, nothing out of an oil well in it.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:30.280]  And I love it, and I discovered it, I don't know, three, four years ago.
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:34.280]  It's absolutely fabulous, and I thought, why not have Marty as a sponsor?
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:36.280]  Marty, good to have you on with us again.
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:40.280]  Thank you for inviting me again for Homeland Cleanliness.
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:47.280]  Marty, just in a nutshell, tell folks about the products, how they save 85% off supermarket prices.
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.280]  Can you put the volume up a little? I can barely hear you.
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.280]  I'm sorry to hear that, Marty.
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.280]  There you go. Now you're great.
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:57.280]  Sure. Go ahead and just tell us a little bit about how you got started,
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:02.280]  why the soap products you have are different than the petrochemicals you get at the store.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:10.280]  Well, we're very stubborn, very old-fashioned, and very conservative in our cleaning options.
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:18.280]  We feel, and we've got tens of thousands of families coast to coast that feel the same way that soap,
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:28.280]  old-fashioned soap from the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, cleans better, doesn't deteriorate the clothing,
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:33.280]  costs far less because you use so little of it. It's still used.
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:40.280]  Old-fashioned soap is still used by motels and hotels in doing all their cleaning.
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:47.280]  They want longevity of their fibers, longevity of their cost factors, and we feel soap is better.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:55.280]  We only make four soaps. That's soap, air soap, dish soap, and laundry soap, and they'll do 200 jobs.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:00.280]  You don't need the all-purpose cleaner, or the floor cleaner, and the window cleaner, and the pre-soaps,
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:06.280]  and all these chemicals that do more harm than good. We feel we've got it.
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:13.280]  We're happy to share it, and we've done this now for almost a year and a half with Alex Jones,
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:19.280]  endorsing our PureSoap products, and we got it, and we want to share it.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:28.280]  Well, Marty, you certainly do have it. Marty, again, go back. How did your family get into real subs?
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  Well, my father worked for civil service, and he retired. I just got out of the Army in 1947,
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:42.280]  and we looked around. What's going on in the American purchasing field?
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:48.280]  Since I was in chemical warfare for two years, I got to know about all the harmful chemicals
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:54.280]  that are hurting everything, and we made a decision at that time, well, let's go into the soap business,
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:12:01.280]  real soap, and the first product we stopped putting up was a bar, a PureSoap bar,
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:08.280]  with none of the chemicals and chlorides and additives in there, and it started to catch on,
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:14.280]  and we started going further. We said, well, if our bar soap works, let's get into hair soap,
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:19.280]  let's get into laundry soap, let's get into dish soap, and that's how we arrived
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:28.280]  and have improved over all these decades the finest quality cleaning products manufactured in the United States of America.
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:32.280]  And it's triple concentrated. You bypass the middleman. It's made in America.
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:38.280]  So on average, you have about 85% off supermarket prices. We use it. My staff loves it. They use it.
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:43.280]  Marty always sends us free boxes of it, though we don't really ask for that. We appreciate it.
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.280]  Folks, call and get a free catalog from Marty and the family and he and his son
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:52.280]  that run the company right there in Oakland, California, and call and get a free catalog

[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:02.280]  We've got a lot of different packages. Give Marty a call. Marty, give him that number.

[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:48.280]  And, Marty, I heard you wrote us a poem. I'm touched.
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:51.280]  Yes, I did. Are you ready? Yes.
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:14:03.280]  Jones keeps on flowing with info that is growing. So you've earned this short poem. No like it? You don't know him.
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:14.280]  Alex, you're bliss itself. You win, you touch all bases. If you were packaged on a shelf, I'd buy 12 dozen cases.
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:26.280]  Your rating is quadruple A. At Genesis, you're the most. Business-wise, I've got to say, you are my favorite host.
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:31.280]  You're a sweetheart, Marty.
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:35.280]  Wow. What a crowd.
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:38.280]  Marty? Thank you. Thank you.
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:41.280]  Marty's now doing sound effects for us.
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:46.280]  It's so wonderful. Thank you. Thank you.
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:50.280]  Hey, Marty. How'd you make that sound effect?
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:55.280]  I got all these people here. I got 2,000 people standing here listening to me.
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:59.280]  Listen, you're a sweetheart, Marty. Always love talking to you. Take care, my friend.
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:01.280]  Talk to you soon. Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:32.280]  You can call me something else, Marty Schachter.
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:37.280]  Okay, I'm going to play part of it now, part of it the next segment, and then we'll get Luke Krodowski on.
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:45.280]  There's no way to set this up without seeing the video. This is so much worse. You've got to see it.
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.280]  And I personally, I want to go have a campaign against these Silverstein employees.
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:55.280]  I personally, well, look, they work for Silverstein. What does that tell you about them?
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:16:01.280]  These are very serious characters. And they come up, and the cops come up, they agree with them.
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:05.280]  It's real funny. They openly yell, he's got a bomb, he's a terrorist.
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:09.280]  He jokes on the tape. They joke on the tape, well, we know you're not a terrorist, but so what?
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:15.280]  You're going to be in the hole for 30 days. And they arrest him as a terrorist in America on the city sidewalk.
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:20.280]  There's just three or four guys out there. They're across the street intimidating other cameras, telling them to turn theirs off.
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:25.280]  Luke's the only one that didn't name his at the ground. And Luke called us up yesterday and said,
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:28.280]  hey, can I have a press pass? They're really starting to harass me and arrest me.
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:34.280]  I said, my God, son, you've got one today. So Luke will be joining us coming up in just a few minutes.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:43.280]  He's just an absolutely fabulous individual, and he's just a pure of heart, and he's the type of person we need to have in the battle against the New World Order.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:47.280]  He doesn't sit there and nitpick and infight and do all the rest of it. He just takes action.
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:54.280]  And this is what he went through. He got arrested, but later they let him go before hauling him off because they knew that people had gotten away with video cameras.
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:01.280]  He confronted Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had him on a few days ago, and Brzezinski said, now, sit down and shut up.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:06.280]  And they drug him out, hissing at him, the architect of Al-Qaeda. He wrote a book, and then he found it at Al-Qaeda.
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:12.280]  But let's go ahead and start going to that clip. Here they are on the street in front of Silverstein Properties in America.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:21.280]  And just unbelievable individuals come in, and they call in the cops who are their servants. Here it is.
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:27.280]  Why would you be calling the cops? We're not doing anything illegal. This is a public sidewalk, a public New York City street.
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:31.280]  Now, this is Port Authority's property, and the building's Port Authority property.
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:34.280]  We're not protesters.
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.280]  So this is on New York City streets. This is Port Authority.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:43.280]  That's how they do it. So you can demonstrate you have your free speech, but they play semantical games and then call you protesters,
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:52.280]  and then use an old agreed-upon regulation that started in D.C. back in the 60s that if you want a march, you get a permit to take over the streets.
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:57.280]  Then they ban everything else. Luke Smart, he says, no, we're not protesters. It's First Amendment.
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:02.280]  See, this is so traitorous. Let's go back to it.
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:18.280]  I wasn't burning for three days.
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:23.280]  Sir, just one second.
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.280]  See, Larry don't want to hear that.
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:29.280]  I know Larry, but who's Larry? Larry's not above the law. We're citizens. We're Americans.
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:33.280]  And you can't report this. You've got to check that out. You can't be reporting this.
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:35.280]  All right, hit pause. Hit pause.
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:45.280]  Imagine two characters literally out of central casting walk up in suits, making the tough guy faces because they're actually so weak.
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:48.280]  Anyways, just weak. You're weak.
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:53.280]  Anyways, I just hate bullies, man. I hate them.
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:55.280]  I'm sorry.
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:00.280]  And scum and backbiters and backstabbers, all of you, you're going straight to hell.
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:05.280]  They walk over and they still go, I don't like what you're saying about Larry.
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:10.280]  And they start like going to these young men.
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.280]  And they're just so nice to them. I can't tell you.
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:14.280]  Can't told you. I told you.
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:18.280]  Turn it off because they want to do a lot more. But you know what?
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:23.280]  They don't follow orders. And then they start accusing them of having bombs. Starts out calling them terrorists.
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:27.280]  You could have a bomb. To announcing criminally, he's got a bomb.
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:32.280]  Now think, this is on a crowded New York street. He needs to be arrested immediately.
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:36.280]  You need to call the NYPD. You need to send him to prisonplanet.com to watch this video.
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:39.280]  And this guy needs to be arrested now.
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:42.280]  One of Silverstein's henchmen. Here it is.
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.280]  Can I ask you why you're taking my picture?
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:52.280]  I have every right to it. You're on the public sidewalk. I'm a citizen.
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:55.280]  Everybody, we were out here before, so I don't mean no disrespect.
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:59.280]  Can you take your camera out of my face? Because you're disrespecting me by doing that.
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:01.280]  So I'm not doing anything legal.
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:07.280]  No, I'm asking you politely, can you take that camera out of my face?
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:10.280]  That's a lot, right?
[02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:13.280]  That's not right. Come on, you gotta send that over, man.
[02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.280]  You have every right to it.
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:16.280]  Alright, hit pause.
[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:19.280]  You saw, man. Yeah, that's the camera.
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:22.280]  This is what you bring, man.
[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:26.280]  We don't like what you're saying about Larry. We called the cops.
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:30.280]  They work for us now. Things are going real well.

[02:21:54.280 --> 02:22:01.280]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:05.280]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S. economy.

[02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:31.280]  Do you know what you can go with solar for under $1200 now?
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:37.280]  Hi, this is Ken Solar. As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:43.280]  The solar-powered generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:50.280]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:53.280]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:24:03.280]  Each solar-powered generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000-watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:07.280]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:09.280]  You know, power companies, government.
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:14.280]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:15.280]  Are you ready to go solar?

[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:31.280]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:36.280]  What would you do if we knew you were not things we knew?
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:39.280]  Would you stand up for true?
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:42.280]  What would you turn away to?
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:47.280]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:50.280]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:52.280]  Oh, would you turn away?
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:54.280]  What would you believe?
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:59.280]  Tell you what, let's come out of the next segment at the part of this song where Paris comes in.
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:06.280]  Going back to Silverstein Properties goons, you can hear them on audio, say they work for them later,
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:09.280]  going, hey, look, wires, might have a bomb.
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:11.280]  Later he says, he got a bomb.
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:13.280]  Handcuff him.
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:18.280]  Totally violates the Patriot Act federal law and other city and county laws.
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:20.280]  I mean, that's fire in the theater, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:24.280]  And it's, ha ha, look, he got arrested.
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:28.280]  Why don't you turn the camera off so we can clap as he is?
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:30.280]  Going back to this tape.
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:32.280]  This is America, and Luke was arrested.
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:34.280]  Here it is.
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:36.280]  What's up, man?
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:38.280]  What's up, man?
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:40.280]  Come on, you got to shut that off, man.
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:42.280]  We have every right to, though.
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:44.280]  We're not doing anything illegal.
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:48.280]  Ricky comes, I think he's got a bomb in his bag.
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:50.280]  Exactly.
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:52.280]  I saw wires coming out of there.
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:54.280]  I think he's got a bomb in his bag.
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:59.280]  We're not terrorists. We're Americans, sir.
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:02.280]  You're right. By the time the government figures it out,
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:04.280]  you'll be in a hole for 30 days.
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.280]  I mean, just understand.
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:08.280]  Just don't record what he's saying.
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:10.280]  Don't record what I'm saying.
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:11.280]  Hey, please, do you have a favor?
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:13.280]  I don't know.
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:15.280]  We have a problem with you guys. Come on.
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:17.280]  What John said.
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:19.280]  We do have a job right now.
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:21.280]  I do have a job, sir.
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:23.280]  Don't record this.
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:26.280]  Shut the camera off right now.
[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:28.280]  Power go to you guys.
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:30.280]  The camera's off, sir?
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:32.280]  Shut the camera off, son.
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:34.280]  Shut it off.
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.280]  I mean, this is a public sidewalk, a public street.
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:43.280]  This is a public street.
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:45.280]  That's a public street.
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:47.280]  This is also a prison.
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:51.280]  I'm on a public street. I'm not allowed to film yet.
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:53.280]  I'm not allowed to film on a public street.
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:55.280]  Put the camera down.
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:57.280]  Put the camera down.
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:59.280]  Put the camera down.
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:01.280]  Put the camera down.
[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:03.280]  Sir, I'm not breaking any laws, sir.
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:05.280]  You're still reporting me. Come on, man.
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:07.280]  You have every right to, sir.
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:09.280]  I'm sorry, but constitutionally and legally,
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:11.280]  you have every right to.
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:13.280]  I know my rights.
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:15.280]  I've been working at the ACLU before,
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:17.280]  and I have every right to.
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:19.280]  Guess who's going to jail?
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:21.280]  Guess who's going to jail?
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:31.280]  How you going to say that, sir? That's slander.
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:33.280]  I saw wires coming out of it.
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:35.280]  I don't know what you have in there.
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:37.280]  I don't know. You look like a terrorist may look like that.
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:39.280]  I don't know what a terrorist looks like.
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:41.280]  Sir, that's very disrespectful.
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:43.280]  I don't know what a terrorist looks like.
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.280]  You may look like a terrorist for all I know.
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:47.280]  How you going to say that?
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:49.280]  I'm not a terrorist, sir.
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:51.280]  You made threats, so now I'm concerned.
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:53.280]  Nobody made a threat.
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:55.280]  Never made a threat, sir.
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.280]  What you're doing right now is slanderous,
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:27:59.280]  and it's libelous.
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:01.280]  You have no right to do that.
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:03.280]  Can we talk about it, sir?
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:05.280]  While we're in Illinois?
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:07.280]  All right, just let us know.
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:09.280]  How you doing, sir?
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.280]  How's everything?
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:13.280]  Fine, I'll get to talk to you.
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:15.280]  Okay, I have to find my homework here.
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:17.280]  We were out here about a month ago,
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:19.280]  and the Port Authority police officers came.
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:21.280]  We have it on record. We have it on camera also.
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:23.280]  And he said that this is private property,
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:25.280]  not as private property, but as far as going to this code.
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:27.280]  This is Greenwich Street, and this is New York City property.
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:29.280]  It's considered a courtyard.
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:31.280]  New York City public property, and therefore we could be here.
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:33.280]  The whole thing is considered a courtyard.
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:35.280]  Except some over there. That's actually the street.
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:37.280]  That street over there.
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.280]  That street's public.
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:41.280]  About a month ago, we were out here,
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:43.280]  and the police officer...
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:30:11.280]  Two clips. One was about 15 minutes.
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:13.280]  I guess that was the short one.
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:19.280]  So we'll try to get things together on the other side.
[02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:21.280]  We're on the march.
[02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:23.280]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:29.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:33.280]  David J. Smith for News Watch magazine.
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:37.280]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism
[02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:41.280]  was to have America become involved in free trade
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:43.280]  with tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods?
[02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:47.280]  Our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete,
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:51.280]  would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:54.280]  This would throw millions of workers out of work
[02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:58.280]  and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:01.280]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass
[02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:06.280]  by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to News Watch magazine.

[02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:37.280]  I don't really know what it takes to succeed.
[02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:40.280]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income
[02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:42.280]  in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:45.280]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:48.280]  will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:51.280]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.

[02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:33.280]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water,
[02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:35.280]  but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.

[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:48.280]  because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens,
[02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:52.280]  become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:55.280]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive,

[02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:55.280]  The Police State trilogy is now out on DVD.
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:57.280]  All my other films.
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:03.280]  And I carry a bunch of other documentaries.
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:07.280]  I carry Loose Change 2nd Edition,
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:10.280]  American Freedom to Fascism, Riddles and Stone,
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:15.280]  a great new film we're carrying about all the occult stuff in Washington, D.C.
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:17.280]  Let's go ahead and go to Luke Rudowski.
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:19.280]  Luke, we're going to play some more of this clip again.
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:20.280]  There's actually a longer version.
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:23.280]  I didn't know we had a shorter, so I was out of the studio in the other room multitasking.
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:26.280]  When I heard suddenly music come on, I ran back in.
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:30.280]  But, Luke, describe for those that haven't seen the video or don't have internet,
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:32.280]  what it was like and what happened.
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:35.280]  Well, this video you're seeing is from April 11th,
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:40.280]  and it's the one we were doing an action on every 11th of each month that we're doing nationwide.
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:46.280]  And we here in New York City went in front of the new Larry Silverstein World Trade Center Building 7 here in New York City,
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:49.280]  where we were confronted with his security guards,
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:53.280]  or as they identify themselves as police officers.
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:57.280]  And they told us that Larry is there and he's pissed off and he doesn't want us there.
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:58.280]  And they told us to leave.
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:34:59.280]  We stood up to these guys.
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:01.280]  We told them we have every right to be there.
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:03.280]  And then they started making threats against us and accusations.
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:09.280]  Now, Luke, let me just stop you for a moment because, again, I wanted to get you on to make all this clear.
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:12.280]  That's the problem with audio outside, obviously.
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:13.280]  I can see their lips.
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:14.280]  I can barely hear them.
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:20.280]  We tried to fox or schmutz, as they say, with the audio so people could hear it.
[02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:22.280]  But, clearly, yeah, they're saying they're cops.
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:28.280]  They look more like mafia claiming they're cops, probably Silverstein, Goon, CIA, you name it.
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:31.280]  But, yes, so if they're not cops, that's illegal.
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:32.280]  But you see them calling the cops.
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:34.280]  The cops act like they are their bosses.
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:35.280]  They probably are detectives.
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:37.280]  Now, does that detective know it's illegal?
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.280]  Because later he said you had a bomb.
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:41.280]  First it was it looks like he has a bomb.
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:43.280]  Later he says he's got a bomb.
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:45.280]  Have you filed a criminal complaint?
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.280]  We have not filed a criminal complaint because we do not have any legal help or legal lawyers.
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:58.280]  And if anybody's listening in the tri-state area, any lawyer or legal aide we could get would be such help, would be a lot of help to us.
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:01.280]  And, you know, that guy, you know, he just started making accusations.
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:02.280]  First he said, you know, look at those strings.
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:04.280]  And then he tried to say, oh, you could have a bomb.
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:06.280]  And then he said, you do have a bomb.
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:10.280]  And that's when they called the Port Authority police officers.
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:14.280]  So he filed a false report, called in a fake bomb threat.
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.280]  Now, that's a major issue, folks.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:18.280]  We've gone through this nationally.
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:19.280]  People are claiming they're cops.
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:21.280]  They call in fake bomb threats.
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:23.280]  They're on the phone saying he's got a bomb.
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:25.280]  People are freaked out on the street in New York.
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:27.280]  And then they, and the cops don't care.
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:29.280]  Hey, call in a fake bomb threat.
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:30.280]  They show up.
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:31.280]  They know it's all a fake bomb threat.
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:34.280]  They get, but they still go ahead and tell them what happened after that.
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:36.280]  Yeah, that's what it's all about.
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:38.280]  You know, that's what this war on terror is about.
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:40.280]  We're just up there standing up for our rights,
[02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:45.280]  educating people, giving out flyers and DVDs about building 7 in a library service team in front of his office.
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:47.280]  And these guys say we're terrorists.
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:49.280]  That's how far this war on terror has gotten.
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:52.280]  So, you know, to stop freedom of speech, to stop doing what we're doing,
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:55.280]  they're calling us terrorists, which is absurd and ludicrous.
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:59.280]  And that's why we need to expose this and show everybody what's really happening.
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:05.280]  If there was ever any doubt about who Silverstein is and how they operate and how they roll,
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:07.280]  there's no doubt now.
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:11.280]  I mean, for people that haven't seen the video, Luke, am I just...
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:15.280]  Hello? Hello, hello?
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:19.280]  I'm here. Hello?
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:22.280]  Yeah, I'm talking right here.
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:25.280]  Check one, two. You guys can hear me? Hello?
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:38:01.280]  Hi, folks. I'm on the phone back up here.
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:05.280]  I actually have two different digital lines, and I'm sure it's all just a big mistake.
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:09.280]  You know, I've had ISDN lines for voice where I don't do radio shows in different offices,
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:11.280]  and they never cut out, ever have problems.
[02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:15.280]  In fact, these never cut out unless I'm on air, and it's always a very key topic.
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:19.280]  But again, I'm sure two separate ISDN lines of different phone companies,
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:23.280]  I'm just absolutely sure that they're cutting out by themselves.
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:25.280]  And it probably is what it is.
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:27.280]  This, again, only happens on key topics.
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:29.280]  And again, it's probably just Murphy's Law.
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:32.280]  So I'm here via telephone line while they try to get my digital lines back up.
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:35.280]  We're very thankful to all our stations for putting up with us today with this.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:37.280]  But it is the cost of liberty.
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:43.280]  Luke, going back to you now, I was bringing up how these guys look like gangsters.
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:45.280]  Can you comment on that, please?
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:48.280]  I mean, these guys were what they were.
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.280]  I mean, that one gentleman that said we had bombs in our backpacks
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:54.280]  actually said that Building 7 was burning for three days.
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:57.280]  That's how smart he is, you know.
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:38:59.280]  He's not the sharpest knife in the draw.
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:03.280]  And he's just one of these thugs, one of these guys who gives the NYPD a bad name.
[02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:05.280]  He doesn't deserve to wear the badge.
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:09.280]  What he doesn't know is, and I'm not exaggerating, if those guys went, both those guys,
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:12.280]  went to L.A. and went to casting calls, they would have jobs.
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:14.280]  Immediately.
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:16.280]  And I'm not joking when I say this.
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:22.280]  Immediately, as gangster thugs, as soldiers on TV shows, instantly,
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:25.280]  they would be on The Sopranos within a week.
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:27.280]  Well, that's basically what these guys are.
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:29.280]  You know, thugs, they're trying to intimidate and scare us
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:32.280]  just because the library service team has gotten mad and he saw us.
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:35.280]  Well, Luke, you could have had the police gun you down.
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:40.280]  I mean, if I went on the downtown street of New York with hundreds of people walking by,
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:42.280]  I was going, he's got a bomb!
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:43.280]  Why is?
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:46.280]  I mean, I would be arrested, and I should be,
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:52.280]  but not when these un-American balls of maggot puke.
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:53.280]  And that's what they are.
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:56.280]  I mean, they're just, and the way they walk up to you and try to intimidate you,
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:02.280]  you know, by making that mafia face, I mean, it's just, oh, you're scum.
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:04.280]  I mean, I love this country so much.
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:09.280]  And to see dogs, pieces of filth, un-American cowards ruling us
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:13.280]  and intimidating a great American like you whose parents came from Poland.
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:15.280]  You were a little boy in Poland back when they would arrest people
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:17.280]  for what you were doing there.
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:19.280]  And the same thing is happening in America.
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:20.280]  It makes me sick, Luke.
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:22.280]  It makes me want to throw up.
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:23.280]  And it's not just there.
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.280]  Christians being arrested for praying on street corners.
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:27.280]  We have the video.
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:29.280]  That's why we have to fight this so bad.
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:31.280]  Next to 500, we have to stand up.
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:32.280]  Go ahead, Luke.
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:34.280]  That's why we have to fight this.
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:35.280]  That's why it's so important, you know.
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:38.280]  Just like in Poland, the people have to stand up, you know.
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:41.280]  And, you know, when the cops came, the situation even got worse
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:44.280]  because the cops came, they detained us for about an hour,
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:46.280]  and they went and stepped near us for an hour.
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:48.280]  And I was asking them, can you guys talk?
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:50.280]  And they said, can we see what's going on here?
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:51.280]  Can I leave?
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:53.280]  They were like, no, stay there and move.
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:55.280]  And then in the video, the cops surrounded us.
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:57.280]  The Port Authority Police Department surrounded us
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:59.280]  with a bunch of, quote, the little sick thugs there.
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:01.280]  And as I was recording the conversation,
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:04.280]  you see one of the police officers reach at the camera,
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:07.280]  at the camera lens, take the camera, turn it off.
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:10.280]  As I was recording the conversation illegally,
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:11.280]  and I told them, what are you doing?
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:13.280]  You know, this is a delivery, give me my camera back.
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:16.280]  But, but, but, you guys have gotten smart.
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:18.280]  And I want to say that this is what we've always advised people to do
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:19.280]  for at least ten years.
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:22.280]  When you're doing one of these operations against the terrorists,
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:24.280]  you've got to have somebody down the street,
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:27.280]  and you got it on tape from down the street,
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:30.280]  and then you cut on the video to that other angle, Luke.
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:32.280]  Well done.
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:34.280]  Yeah, you always need two cameras.
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:36.280]  Luckily, we were allowed to borrow a camera from friends.
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:38.280]  We really don't have all the cameras.
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:40.280]  Luke, hey, the problem's handled.
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:44.280]  I'm going to buy you two cameras today.
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:46.280]  They're going to be mailed to you, my friend.
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:47.280]  God bless you, wow.
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:49.280]  Because, I mean, to see you guys fighting, not even having cameras,
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:51.280]  no, I'm going to get them to you,
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:56.280]  because you are exemplifying everything we need to defeat this enemy,
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:00.280]  going up against those travesties to America.
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:04.280]  They are anti-American, like the devil is the antichrist,
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:05.280]  they are the anti-American.
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:09.280]  They are literally quintessential dirtbag thugs,
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:12.280]  and they need to be arrested now.
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:15.280]  I want everybody to call New York and call that gangster Bloomberg
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:18.280]  and call them all, and we're going to put the headline out.
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:21.280]  Men claiming to be New York police issue fake bomb threat
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:24.280]  almost cause riot on New York streets.
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:27.280]  We need to get after them aggressively, Luke.
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:31.280]  We definitely do, and any legal help you could get, we would greatly appreciate.
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:34.280]  Thank you so much for helping us with these cameras.
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:36.280]  These cameras are definitely going to make you proud with that.
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:38.280]  But also, I didn't even finish.
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:41.280]  When I had the camera, when they took the camera away from me illegally,
[02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:43.280]  then I got my phone out, and I was about to call you,
[02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:45.280]  because you were on the air that day,
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:48.280]  and I was about to call you to put the conversation on record on speakerphone.
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:51.280]  The other officer also grabbed my cell phone,
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:53.280]  and I asked, why are you taking my phone away?
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:55.280]  And then he tried to claim that it was a gun.
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:56.280]  That's what he told me.
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:01.280]  And then, after that, those guys tried to intimidate and scare me and my friend from not being there.
[02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:04.280]  You've got to be careful. You've got an actual mob on you now.
[02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:06.280]  I mean, who do we think carried out the attacks, folks?
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:09.280]  It was the Mafia. That's what our government is.
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:14.280]  What is it like to see America turn into a Mafia haven where they rule over us?
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:18.280]  It's a sad thing. It's a sad day in America when these things happen to true Americans.
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:22.280]  And you know what? My family went through it in Poland, and my family fought for it.
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:23.280]  I'm going to fight for it here.
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:25.280]  And I'm going to make sure we take back this country,
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:30.280]  take back American sovereignty and the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:31.280]  We're going to beat them, my friend.
[02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:34.280]  And, you know, right now we're using the info war.
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:36.280]  We're trying to be restrained.
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:39.280]  But they're going to keep pushing, and they're just going to get their butts kicked. I'm sorry.
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:43.280]  They're going to keep pushing, but we're going to keep fighting back, and they're going to get their butts kicked.
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:47.280]  And I would just really like to thank all the people out here in New York City that are a part of change,
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:49.280]  that come out to these organizations.
[02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:53.280]  And the website is wearechange.org, correct?
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:54.280]  Yes, wearechange.org.
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:57.280]  And I'm just one person. There's many people in this fight,
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:00.280]  and so I'd like to thank these people from the bottom of my heart that always help me out,
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:03.280]  always come out to the grounds of Europe, and always, you know, do all these things with me.
[02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:05.280]  God bless all those people. They know who they are.
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:08.280]  Well, Luke, I get so desensitized to all the things that are happening.
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:13.280]  After I got off the air on the 11th, I heard that you'd been arrested and all that had happened.
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:16.280]  They'd taken everything, and then I kind of, you know, called you a week later,
[02:44:16.280 --> 02:44:19.280]  but got you on about Brzezinski and kind of glazed over it.
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:22.280]  And we can't let that happen, like with the hate laws.
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:25.280]  They just keep introducing them, keep introducing them until we get acclimated to it.
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:30.280]  And I watched that in full. I watched a little bit before, and I just, I couldn't believe it.
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:34.280]  He goes from, that might be a bomb, he could have a bomb, to yelling, he's got a bomb!
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:39.280]  I mean, and they think claiming you've got a gun is okay.
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:43.280]  And I mean, it's so scary that America has turned into this,
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:48.280]  and Silverstein's own private goons, who are the police.
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:52.280]  Now, have you confirmed these guys are cops? They were claiming they were cops, correct?
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:56.280]  The first time we went out by Building 7, they identified themselves as police officers.
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:45:01.280]  We did street actions there before, and it's a public street, and they know it.
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:03.280]  And I don't know why they try to pull this off.
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:06.280]  And the first time we went out there, they showed us some badges,
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:08.280]  and they told us to stop, and they detained us before.
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:10.280]  Second time we came out there, they did the same thing,
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:13.280]  but we stood our ground, and we stood there for about a while.
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:15.280]  They tell us they're police officers.
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:18.280]  They're either former or current NYPD police officers.
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:21.280]  I don't know if they're former or current police officers, though.
[02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:24.280]  Of course, it's come out that Bernard Kirik was mafia.
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:27.280]  Giuliani's dad was a mafia boss, a capo.
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:31.280]  That's mainstream news, ruled by these men.
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:35.280]  And they've been fighting with their own wimpy kind so long,
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:39.280]  they don't understand they need to leave real Americans alone.
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:41.280]  We're the type of Americans that won World War II.
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:44.280]  We're the type of Americans that kicked the British hind end.
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:47.280]  You can go feed on the little old ladies and the immigrants
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:49.280]  and the people that are used to your dirtbag behavior.
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:52.280]  Don't mess with us, scum. We're sick of you.
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:53.280]  And I want everybody to know that.
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:55.280]  I want everybody to call New York City police,
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:58.280]  and you tell them that that was an act of terrorism,
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:01.280]  them claiming that people had bombs down there.
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:03.280]  It could have created a major incident.
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:05.280]  We're going to give a story up on this,
[02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:07.280]  and we're calling for those terrorist arrests.
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:10.280]  It is terrorism to claim there are bombs when there aren't.
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:12.280]  And then they even admit on the tape,
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:14.280]  hey, you're going to be in the hole for 30 days.
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:16.280]  Doesn't matter that you're not a terrorist.
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:20.280]  I mean, we've got them admitting they're there racketeering,
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:24.280]  and they're there trying to frame young American men.
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:27.280]  Now, tell them what your placard said.
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:31.280]  My placard had a big banner that stated that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:33.280]  It's a beautiful big sign.
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:39.280]  Oh, my God. I'm just so sick of this filth.
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:42.280]  We're going to get the video posted back up on the main page.
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:44.280]  Your website is wearechange.org.
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:47.280]  You're the real 9-11 truth in New York,
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:50.280]  and you're rampaging forward, Luke,
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:52.280]  and we're going to get you some more cameras
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:55.280]  so you can be more effective and be more protected.
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:57.280]  And you need to start wearing a wire.
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:00.280]  You can get a little mini-disc recorder or a little bottle chip recorder,
[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:03.280]  a small chip recorder that's tiny with a tiny mic,
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:06.280]  and you need to just totally ace these clowns,
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:09.280]  and we're going to get them.
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:11.280]  And they've already got in trouble with the CIA
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:13.280]  spying on the local bike-riding organization.
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:16.280]  I mean, that's how bad it is in your New World Order city.
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:18.280]  But you know what?
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:21.280]  I guarantee you those thugs aren't going to like the fact that they've been exposed.
[02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:23.280]  They also came out, and it's on the tape,
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:25.280]  and said Larry's, quote, pissed off.
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:28.280]  Excuse that term. It's a documentary show or a documentary what they said,
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:31.280]  that Larry himself had dispatched them.
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:33.280]  Yeah, he said Larry doesn't want to hear that,
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:35.280]  and then I told him, who's Larry?
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:37.280]  Larry is a citizen just like I am.
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:39.280]  Larry don't want to hear it, Steve.
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:42.280]  You go shut up now. This ain't your country no more.
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:46.280]  You understand? We've taken over.
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:48.280]  See, those guys are the terrorists.
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:50.280]  And if you look at other videos that we've put out before,
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:53.280]  you can actually see the anti-terrorism unit,
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:55.280]  Hercules teams in New York City,
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:58.280]  actually confront us with M-16s, with German Shepherds,
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:00.280]  and try to intimidate and stop us.
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:03.280]  They can't wait. They can't wait to take our families in
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:05.280]  and beat our children to death with clubs.
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:07.280]  They can't wait to put us in camps.
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:08.280]  They build FEMA camps everywhere.
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:10.280]  And I'm sorry, folks. Let them come.
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:14.280]  Just let these cowardly, big, fat-bellied pieces of trash
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:16.280]  come and mess with real Americans.
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:18.280]  All we want is freedom and liberty,
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:21.280]  and we're tired of their mafia crap.
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:25.280]  Oh, man, I just see my country be ruled by king rat thugs.
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:27.280]  It's so pathetic.
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:30.280]  I'm glad my grandfathers aren't allowed to see this.
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:31.280]  I just can't believe it.
[02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:34.280]  I can't believe we've turned into this.
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:36.280]  God help us.
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:37.280]  We've got to stay positive.
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:38.280]  We've got to keep fighting back.
[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:39.280]  We've got to stand up.
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:41.280]  We've got to stand up on every 11th of each month
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:44.280]  until a lie of netalem comes out, and it's coming out.
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:46.280]  People are waking up.
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:48.280]  Those officers give a bad name.
[02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:49.280]  They don't deserve to wear the badge.
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:51.280]  There's many more officers here in the city that know the truth,
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:54.280]  that will stand up for the truth, that know what's going on,
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:55.280]  and those are the guys we have to stand by,
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:58.280]  those are the guys that can't give these guys a bad name.
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:00.280]  And we're going to do it, man. I'm telling you.
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:04.280]  We're going to take this country back no matter what.
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:05.280]  No matter what.
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:08.280]  Well, look, I got your phone call a few weeks ago.
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:10.280]  Obviously, you couldn't call in line because they stole it on your phone
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:12.280]  when they arrested you there.
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:18.280]  But, I mean, I'm just speechless to watch them.
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:20.280]  It was the relish they were doing it with.
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:22.280]  They were enjoying it.
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:25.280]  And then they were going to get handcuffed.
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:29.280]  I mean, is it fun for them to kill America?
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:30.280]  I mean, it's a sad situation.
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:31.280]  I don't know.
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:32.280]  Those guys are scum.
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:33.280]  Literally, scum.
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:35.280]  You know, just like Brzezinski.
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:40.280]  They're just mindless thugs that can't even have a rational thought in their mind.
[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:42.280]  It's up to us to change that, man.
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:46.280]  Well, they issued a fake bomb threat on the street of New York.
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:48.280]  You got a bomb!
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:49.280]  He says it loud.
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:53.280]  I mean, that is a federal crime on video.
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:57.280]  Federal crime on video.
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:04.280]  And, man, I remember when I in 2000 saw that video of Abbie Newman
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:07.280]  and I find a pocket Constitution and the state police say,
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:11.280]  this may be illegal.
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:14.280]  Luke, where do you see this going in the future?
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:17.280]  I think we just have to, you know, keep educating the cops here in New York City,
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:21.280]  keep educating the military, because the global elite, the Brzezinskis,
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:24.280]  Rockefeller's, are nobody without the Army and without the police department.
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:26.280]  And that's what we're doing here in New York City.
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:28.280]  We're outreaching to the police department.
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:31.280]  We're outreaching to the military and educating them about the new world order,
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:34.280]  about the destruction of the Constitution and about 9-11.
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:36.280]  And I think everybody has to do it.
[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:38.280]  I think everybody has to stand up.
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:40.280]  And I'm going to remain optimistic, and I think we can do it.
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:43.280]  I think we can slowly but surely take this country back.
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:45.280]  Loose change is coming out of theaters.
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:47.280]  We're going to be here in New York City on 9-11-07,
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:51.280]  and we're going to make history again, just like we made history on 9-11-06.
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:52.280]  And we're going to do it.
[02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:54.280]  I'm telling you, we've got to stay positive.
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:55.280]  These guys are scum.
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:56.280]  But guess what?
[02:50:56.280 --> 02:50:58.280]  There's all the officers that look down on what these guys are doing.
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:00.280]  It's going to come out.
[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:01.280]  Luke, how long?
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:03.280]  When we come back, one final comment from you.
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:05.280]  I want to find out how long you were in handcuffs,
[02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:08.280]  what they said to you once it happened, once they took your camera away.
[02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:10.280]  We only have the video of you at a distance.
[02:51:10.280 --> 02:51:14.280]  The website is prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:16.280]  And we have links on the website.
[02:51:16.280 --> 02:51:20.280]  Lisa told my webmaster to wearechange.org.
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:21.280]  Stay with us.
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.280]  The video is up there on wearechange.org.
[02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:24.280]  Stay with us.
[02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:32.280]  It's here.
[02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:35.280]  After a year introduction and traveling to distant lands,
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:37.280]  my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:39.280]  Shocking declassified government documents prove
[02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:42.280]  that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:45.280]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:49.280]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[02:51:49.280 --> 02:51:53.280]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:56.280]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[02:51:56.280 --> 02:52:00.280]  the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:05.280]  secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:09.280]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:11.280]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:15.280]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:31.280]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy,
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:34.280]  but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:52:34.280 --> 02:52:37.280]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:42.280]  are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:46.280]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection
[02:52:46.280 --> 02:52:51.280]  from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:54.280]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning
[02:52:54.280 --> 02:52:57.280]  by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:52:57.280 --> 02:53:02.280]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:05.280]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form
[02:53:05.280 --> 02:53:09.280]  because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children,
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:11.280]  the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:16.280]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5

[02:53:28.280 --> 02:53:30.280]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:34.280]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:38.280]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers,
[02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:41.280]  social security cards, banking information, and more
[02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:43.280]  all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:46.280]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:48.280]  because you left it unlocked.
[02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:52.280]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on,
[02:53:52.280 --> 02:53:55.280]  you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and big brother
[02:53:55.280 --> 02:53:57.280]  to access your personal information.
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:54:04.280]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 network security switch from Net7 Technologies.

[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:37.280]  Before you slip into unconsciousness
[02:54:37.280 --> 02:54:43.280]  I'd like to have another kiss
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:46.280]  Another
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:49.280]  Lashing chance at bliss
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:53.280]  Chance at bliss
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:54.280]  Another
[02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:59.280]  Alright, I'm told I'm over driving even on this telephone, so upset.
[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:02.280]  Here I am with Luke Rudowski of 9-11 Truth in New York.
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:04.280]  We are change.org.
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:06.280]  What a great name.
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:09.280]  What great folks there in New York taking action.
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:13.280]  Luke, how long were you handcuffed after they quoted they were arresting you?
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:16.280]  Once they had disarmed you of documenting their activities,
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:18.280]  they didn't know there was a camera down the street,
[02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:20.280]  what type of pleasures did they have with you?
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:25.280]  It's important to know, luckily they never handcuffed us, but they did detain us.
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:28.280]  I saw you with your hands behind your back on the video with cops.
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:31.280]  The guy told me, don't move your hands around,
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:34.280]  don't put your hands in your pockets, don't move your hands around.
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:36.280]  You'd already called your cell phone a guy.
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:40.280]  And the only thing I could do, and he said, just put your hands behind your back, don't move your hands.
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:46.280]  And that's what I did, I just put my hands behind my back and I didn't make any set of movements to worry these guys.
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:50.280]  But they did detain us for an hour, which means they questioned us and they didn't know what to do.
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:53.280]  And it's important to know in New York City there's two police divisions,
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:56.280]  the Port Authority Police Department and the New York City Police Department,
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:55:58.280]  and they're two different divisions.
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:02.280]  And those two divisions were deliberating for about an hour on what to do far away from us.
[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:08.280]  They were either thinking either really calling in a bomb threat, really calling in a threat,
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:12.280]  or really just threatening us and bullying us out of there.
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:17.280]  I guarantee you there was probably one or two sane cops, and I bet they were saying to the other cops,
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:21.280]  what are you doing calling in bomb threats, man?
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:25.280]  They were there for an hour. They were arguing with each other what to do.
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:31.280]  They should have arrested those guys because, my God, are police allowed to call in?
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:35.280]  And they walk up, they say, Silverstein doesn't like you. You're not allowed to have the sign here.
[02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:37.280]  It's clearly on tape, but that's why they were upset.
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:42.280]  They claim they're police officers, and then he says he's got a bomb and calls the police.
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:49.280]  My God, this is the most cut-and-dry bomb threat on video called in by some grease bucket,
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:52.280]  and he needs to go to jail.
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:55.280]  Yeah, I mean, those guys were also telling us to turn off the camera.
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:57:00.280]  It was very smart of us not to, because if we really did, then they really would have legitimized everything.
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:03.280]  They really would have done what they wanted with us, and it's always important.
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:06.280]  Whenever you do these street actions, always, no matter what, keep these cameras on.
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:09.280]  You have every right to, as a citizen.
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:11.280]  Well, there's also tiny recorders now.
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:13.280]  We've actually got one.
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:18.280]  Tiny little digital chip that's like the size of a pen, and it's got a little microphone,
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:21.280]  and those idiots don't even know about them.
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:22.280]  That's when all the cops pull me over.
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:26.280]  I just reach over and click it on and go, yes, hi, how you doing?
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:29.280]  So we've got to start recording the enemy of America.
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:35.280]  And again, some of their soldiers may be good people, but the system is the enemy of America.
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:36.280]  It is a parasite.
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:37.280]  We will defeat the enemy.
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:41.280]  You're going to be defeated, you slack-jawed mafia scum.
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:43.280]  Luke Rudowski, I'm going to call you in an hour.
[02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:46.280]  I've got technical stuff I've got to work on here, and I've got a bunch of other phone calls I've got to make.
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:52.280]  But I want to call you, and I think it'll just be better if I just overnight you a check,
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:54.280]  so you can go buy the cameras you want.
[02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:57.280]  I would just recommend buying like $400 little Sonys.
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:57:58.280]  Then you'll have two of them.
[02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:03.280]  I'll buy you two of those, or you can buy one bigger $800 camera if you want.
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:09.280]  But in my experience, the little $350 to $400 ones are really effective for the kind of guerrilla stuff you're doing.
[02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:11.280]  So we'll be sending that off to you, my friend.
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:12.280]  God bless you, man.
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:14.280]  This really means so much to us.
[02:58:14.280 --> 02:58:15.280]  We started from nothing.
[02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:18.280]  We lost everything lately, and we were rebuilding because of great people like you.
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:19.280]  And God bless you.
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:20.280]  I understand, my friend.
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:21.280]  I'll talk to you in an hour.
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:22.280]  God bless you.
[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:25.280]  Yeah, I've seen Luke the last few weeks asking for more help with the camera and stuff.
[02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:26.280]  I thought somebody else would step up.
[02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:28.280]  So that's what we do here.
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:29.280]  We step up to the plate.
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:34.280]  And if you want to support me and my staff and my crew and what we're doing so I can buy cameras for young men like Luke,
[02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:41.280]  Radowski, a college student who does work a full-time job, didn't have the money to buy a camera in New York, so expensive,
[02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:43.280]  buy videos from us, buy books from us.
[02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:46.280]  I'll be on the radio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., God willing.
[02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:48.280]  You can listen to that at mfoawars.com.
[02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:50.280]  But seriously, financially support us.
[02:58:50.280 --> 02:58:51.280]  Want to donate to us.
[02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:53.280]  We've gotten to the point where we need it.
[02:58:53.280 --> 02:58:54.280]  Don't donate to us.
[02:58:54.280 --> 02:58:55.280]  So that's easier for you.
[02:58:55.280 --> 02:58:56.280]  All right.
[02:58:56.280 --> 02:58:57.280]  Take care, folks.
[02:58:57.280 --> 02:58:58.280]  Have a great weekend.
[02:58:58.280 --> 02:58:59.280]  Spend some time with your family.
[02:58:59.280 --> 02:59:02.280]  And please support us in the work we're doing.
[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:03.280]  Great job to the crew right on the show.
[02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:05.280]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:08.280]  God bless you all.
[02:59:08.280 --> 02:59:19.280]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at gcnlive.com or call toll-free 877-37645.
[02:59:19.280 --> 02:59:23.280]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S. are located?
[02:59:23.280 --> 02:59:27.280]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:32.280]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:34.280]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters,
[02:59:34.280 --> 02:59:37.280]  you can pinpoint natural and manmade disaster areas,
[02:59:37.280 --> 02:59:40.280]  proving environmental catastrophes, the safest cities,
[02:59:40.280 --> 02:59:43.280]  the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more,
[02:59:43.280 --> 02:59:46.280]  complete with 3 gigabytes of detailed information
[02:59:46.280 --> 02:59:49.280]  on each of 3,000-plus counties in the U.S.,
[02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:51.280]  including 558 cities.
