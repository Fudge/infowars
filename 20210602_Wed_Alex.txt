[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:13.480 --> 00:16.800]  Nixon was ousted for far less corruption.
[00:16.800 --> 00:24.200]  But in all of my years of public life, I have never profited, never profited from public
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.200]  service.
[00:25.200 --> 00:32.400]  I've earned every cent, and in all of my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice.
[00:32.400 --> 00:38.280]  And I think too that I can say that in my years of public life that I welcome this kind
[00:38.280 --> 00:42.640]  of examination, because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.
[00:42.640 --> 00:44.520]  Well, I'm not a crook.
[00:44.520 --> 00:46.840]  I've earned everything I've got.
[00:46.840 --> 00:52.380]  Joe Biden was elected for far more, and if the disintegration of accountability from those
[00:52.380 --> 00:57.800]  in the highest of office continues, America will definitely collapse.
[00:57.800 --> 01:03.880]  Why wasn't you found the allegations against Joe Biden related to his son, or Brisma, not
[01:03.880 --> 01:04.880]  to be believed?
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.560]  Simply because I've known former Vice President Biden for a long time.
[01:09.560 --> 01:16.080]  I know how he respects his duties of higher office, and it's just not credible to me that
[01:16.080 --> 01:21.840]  a vice president of the United States is going to do anything other than act as how he sees
[01:21.840 --> 01:23.560]  best for the national interest.
[01:23.560 --> 01:28.880]  While the Biden family has still not had to answer to Congress as to why they were given
[01:28.880 --> 01:35.000]  massive payments from corrupt foreign energy companies, records show that Hunter Biden
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.760]  opened a line of credit with a Chinese national linked to the communist regime and funded
[01:42.760 --> 01:54.040]  it with approximately $100,000, and then he, James Biden, and Sarah Biden went on an extravagant
[01:54.040 --> 01:57.960]  global spending spree.
[01:57.960 --> 02:06.000]  Still other records show that Hunter Biden, via his law firm, also sent a million dollars
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.680]  to James Biden's consulting firm, the Lion Hall Group.
[02:11.680 --> 02:16.960]  And Joe Biden has relentlessly distanced himself from the accusations.
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.520]  Look, my son did nothing wrong.
[02:21.520 --> 02:22.680]  I did nothing wrong.
[02:22.680 --> 02:26.080]  Did you and your father ever discuss you friends?
[02:26.080 --> 02:27.080]  No.
[02:27.080 --> 02:31.720]  As I said, the only time was after a news account, and it wasn't a discussion, and then he went
[02:31.720 --> 02:32.720]  on.
[02:32.720 --> 02:35.520]  Understanding of what your son was doing for an extraordinary amount of money.
[02:35.520 --> 02:37.040]  I don't know what he was doing.
[02:37.040 --> 02:38.320]  I know he was on the board.
[02:38.320 --> 02:40.960]  I found out he was on the board after he was on the board.
[02:40.960 --> 02:44.680]  We had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.840]  learned of a barisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong.
[02:49.840 --> 02:56.400]  I carried out U.S. policy, not one single solitary thing was out of line, not a single
[02:56.400 --> 02:57.400]  thing.
[02:57.400 --> 03:03.480]  But now, as the New York Post reveals, Joe Biden met with Ukrainian, Russian, and Kazakhstan-y
[03:03.480 --> 03:10.320]  business associates of his sons at a dinner in Washington, D.C., while he was vice president.
[03:10.320 --> 03:15.600]  According to records on Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop, the following day, Hunter received
[03:15.600 --> 03:22.080]  an email from Vadim Posarsky, an executive of the Ukrainian energy company, Barisma,
[03:22.080 --> 03:25.320]  to thank him for introducing him to his father.
[03:25.320 --> 03:31.200]  It read, Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to D.C. and giving an opportunity to meet
[03:31.200 --> 03:32.360]  your father.
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.280]  Posarsky wrote on April 17, 2015.
[03:36.280 --> 03:39.840]  He continued, It's really an honor and a pleasure.
[03:39.840 --> 03:46.240]  The dinner included Russian billionaire Yelena Batarina, who was married to corrupt former
[03:46.240 --> 03:48.920]  Moscow mayor Yuri Luzkov.
[03:48.920 --> 03:58.240]  Batarina had wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden on February 14, 2014, through his Rosemont-Seneca-Thornton
[03:58.240 --> 04:03.880]  Delaware-based investment firm, which was co-founded by Devin Archer, a former advisor
[04:03.880 --> 04:06.480]  to Secretary of State John Kerry.
[04:06.480 --> 04:14.920]  Secretary of State Kerry publicly denied knowing Hunter Biden's role on the Barisma
[04:14.920 --> 04:17.600]  Board.
[04:17.600 --> 04:24.000]  We acquired evidence that shows that Kerry did, in fact, know about that role.
[04:24.000 --> 04:35.600]  And of course, the chronic crackhead, Hunter Biden.
[04:35.600 --> 04:41.760]  The wires had been flagged in suspicious activity reports provided by the Treasury to a Senate
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.000]  Republican inquiry into Hunter Biden last year by the Homeland Security and Government
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.360]  Affairs Committee.
[04:48.360 --> 04:50.920]  But still, nothing has been done.
[04:50.920 --> 04:57.160]  Joe Biden is riding on a wave of corruption, but eventually, if there is any justice left
[04:57.160 --> 04:58.680]  in this country.
[04:58.680 --> 05:02.200]  I always shoot you straight, and when I've told you over the years that if you don't
[05:02.200 --> 05:05.600]  support us, we'll be off the air, it's been true.
[05:05.600 --> 05:11.160]  But Info Wars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more
[05:11.160 --> 05:12.160]  vital.
[05:12.160 --> 05:15.400]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things, I'm not going to take time up to
[05:15.400 --> 05:16.400]  whine about it.
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.400]  It's okay.
[05:17.400 --> 05:19.400]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target.
[05:19.400 --> 05:21.440]  We're having a great effect.
[05:21.440 --> 05:22.640]  We're exposing evil.
[05:22.640 --> 05:23.640]  You're exposing evil.
[05:23.640 --> 05:27.400]  So you spread the word about the broadcaster, when you buy products, or when you pray for
[05:27.400 --> 05:32.520]  Info Wars, and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[05:32.520 --> 05:38.960]  So again, as Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate
[05:38.960 --> 05:43.000]  you as being veterans of the Info War, and I particularly think our veterans as well
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.880]  that have served the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice, and
[05:46.880 --> 05:51.720]  they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our Republic to expose the globalist of
[05:51.720 --> 05:53.960]  a foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[05:53.960 --> 05:55.560]  So it's a very historical time to be alive.
[05:55.560 --> 06:23.320]  I want to thank you all for your support, and ask you to support us again.
[06:25.560 --> 06:31.920]  Thanks to you kids, we now know the virus is a hoax.
[06:31.920 --> 06:36.080]  They included flu, pneumonia, and other infections to boost the numbers.
[06:36.080 --> 06:38.120]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[06:38.120 --> 06:41.720]  Like, President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[06:41.720 --> 06:42.720]  Oh, she's pink.
[06:42.720 --> 06:43.720]  Dr. Fauci.
[06:43.720 --> 06:53.320]  Like, I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them.
[06:53.320 --> 06:55.280]  Microsoft's Bill Gates.
[06:55.280 --> 07:00.520]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's
[07:00.520 --> 07:01.520]  population.
[07:01.520 --> 07:02.520]  I get it.
[07:02.520 --> 07:06.480]  So Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly
[07:06.480 --> 07:07.480]  disease outbreak.
[07:07.480 --> 07:08.480]  That's diabolical.
[07:08.480 --> 07:10.840]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[07:10.840 --> 07:12.080]  Don't worry, kids.
[07:12.080 --> 07:15.520]  These globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time.
[07:15.520 --> 07:19.960]  Where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house.
[07:19.960 --> 07:20.960]  Yeah.
[07:20.960 --> 07:27.960]  Got a little rock round at home.
[07:27.960 --> 07:49.680]  It's a war, tomorrow's news today.
[07:49.680 --> 07:56.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, June 2nd, the year is 2021.
[07:56.560 --> 08:03.600]  Thank you so much for joining us today on this live uncensored transmission.
[08:03.600 --> 08:06.920]  Okay.
[08:06.920 --> 08:12.000]  The wheels have completely come off the COVID-19 operation.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.560]  The globalists are in deep trouble.
[08:15.560 --> 08:23.400]  We put out that little dark comedy piece that you just saw, that you're a TV viewer, you
[08:23.400 --> 08:31.280]  just heard of your radio listener, that Spoof on Scooby-Doo where Fauci and Gates get caught
[08:31.280 --> 08:36.880]  running the pandemic, launching the operation, and so they go to prison for it.
[08:36.880 --> 08:39.120]  And we put that out a year ago.
[08:39.120 --> 08:45.520]  It was banned on Twitter and Facebook as fake news when it was obviously a parody, but basically
[08:45.520 --> 08:48.160]  based on real things they've done.
[08:48.160 --> 08:51.400]  But boy, a year later, it's evergreen, isn't it?
[08:51.400 --> 08:57.280]  Meaning, it's more important now than when we first put it out.
[08:57.280 --> 09:02.360]  Busted, Scooby-Doo just solved the COVID-19 mystery.
[09:02.360 --> 09:06.840]  It's got 200 plus thousand views at Band.video.
[09:06.840 --> 09:09.760]  I think it needs a lot more than that, doesn't it?
[09:09.760 --> 09:15.800]  In fact, let's make it the featured video at Band.video.
[09:15.800 --> 09:19.760]  Because this radio slash TV transmission is not just your regular entertainment, it's
[09:19.760 --> 09:21.880]  not just your regular news program.
[09:21.880 --> 09:28.640]  This is a participation sport, and I think that censored report that you can find only
[09:28.640 --> 09:33.480]  at Band.video needs to get shared, don't you, in light of what's just come out that I'll
[09:33.480 --> 09:35.400]  break down here in just a moment.
[09:35.400 --> 09:36.720]  In fact, let me just do it now.
[09:36.720 --> 09:38.640]  Let me just hit the headlines now.
[09:38.640 --> 09:44.600]  In February of 2020, email that's public now, Fauci wrote, face mask not effective in keeping
[09:44.600 --> 09:45.680]  out virus.
[09:45.680 --> 09:51.280]  Later, he wrote, though, that it has a good psychological effect, and even publicly said,
[09:51.280 --> 09:56.920]  it's about respect, living in fear, keeping everybody scared.
[09:56.920 --> 09:57.920]  Total open and shut.
[09:57.920 --> 09:59.920]  You should be able to use any of this in court.
[09:59.920 --> 10:03.600]  There's cases all over the country where they're trying to make people still wear masks in schools
[10:03.600 --> 10:05.000]  and in businesses.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.360]  Even in Texas where the governor has $1,000 fine for it, I know a lot of people that work
[10:09.360 --> 10:14.160]  at law firms and at stores and at government facilities where they're trying to make people
[10:14.160 --> 10:18.400]  wear them as well, and take the poison shots.
[10:18.400 --> 10:19.560]  That's an important article.
[10:19.560 --> 10:25.720]  Continuing, 17-year-old sufferers, rare heart condition, following Pfizer injection, CDC
[10:25.720 --> 10:26.720]  investigating.
[10:26.720 --> 10:32.760]  Yeah, they're always going to investigate, but hiring a fox to investigate hens, like
[10:32.760 --> 10:34.240]  somebody's eating the hens at night.
[10:34.240 --> 10:35.840]  Oh, there's a fox right there.
[10:35.840 --> 10:36.840]  Mr. Fox.
[10:36.840 --> 10:40.240]  Oh, you have feathers sticking out of your mouth and blood all over you.
[10:40.240 --> 10:41.240]  Oh, never mind.
[10:41.240 --> 10:43.760]  He says, would you like me to investigate?
[10:43.760 --> 10:44.760]  Yes.
[10:44.760 --> 10:46.760]  Will you stand guard over the hens tonight?
[10:46.760 --> 10:50.440]  And then there's more dead hens the next day, and you just keep wondering, gee, that fox
[10:50.440 --> 10:51.440]  is getting really fat.
[10:51.440 --> 10:54.120]  Mr. Fox, why are you getting so fat?
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.000]  Well, I've just come into a great inheritance of your ignorance and you're letting me eat
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000]  all the hens.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.200]  But of course, he wouldn't tell you that, would he?
[11:02.200 --> 11:05.200]  It's always, oh, it's very rare, and oh, they're investigating.
[11:05.200 --> 11:12.040]  I see about 30 of these articles a day without even trying to look.
[11:12.040 --> 11:17.280]  And if you're a TV viewer, we have some footage here of a fox actually eating a chicken.
[11:17.280 --> 11:20.160]  Actually he's loving the chicken.
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.800]  Like when weird perverts in the government convince your children to have their genitals
[11:24.800 --> 11:29.440]  cut off and even have the right to be convinced that they're not of age.
[11:29.440 --> 11:30.440]  They're not a fox.
[11:30.440 --> 11:33.960]  Well, they're a loving guardian.
[11:33.960 --> 11:36.800]  And by the way, let me hit the Fauci news here in a minute.
[11:36.800 --> 11:40.040]  Let me get back into all these COVID news next segment.
[11:40.040 --> 11:43.520]  And let me just tell you some of the other stuff coming up today.
[11:43.520 --> 11:47.120]  And then I'll go into each area of the news and tell you about the big guess we've got.
[11:47.120 --> 11:54.800]  But first, I went over to my parents on Memorial Day, my dad grilled hamburgers, and my mom
[11:54.800 --> 11:56.280]  made baked beans and deviled eggs.
[11:56.280 --> 11:57.760]  It was all delicious.
[11:57.760 --> 12:03.000]  We swam in their swimming pool, myself and my children and family, my wife.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.520]  And there's an old family friend that I've known since I was three years old.
[12:05.520 --> 12:07.200]  She's a great lady.
[12:07.200 --> 12:12.200]  And she came over to the house and I've been friends with her son and her daughter since
[12:12.200 --> 12:15.360]  I was about three years old again.
[12:15.360 --> 12:17.760]  And so when she tells me a story, it's accurate.
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.560]  Of course, we already know all this, but I know her sister very well and I know her
[12:22.560 --> 12:23.560]  daughter very well.
[12:23.560 --> 12:29.200]  And I guess I've gotten old enough now where, you know, my friends are 70 years old, but
[12:29.200 --> 12:34.040]  she has a granddaughter, her sister does.
[12:34.040 --> 12:37.880]  My friend has a granddaughter as well, but so I'm friends with a family going way back.
[12:37.880 --> 12:38.880]  We vacation together.
[12:38.880 --> 12:39.880]  We camp together.
[12:39.880 --> 12:42.480]  So they're our best friends as a family.
[12:42.480 --> 12:46.040]  And they live in Rockwall where I grew up.
[12:46.040 --> 12:47.720]  That is her sister does.
[12:47.720 --> 12:52.440]  And they're evangelical Christians, they're very nice people, very successful in business.
[12:52.440 --> 13:03.200]  And one of the daughters, the granddaughter was arguing with her mother about issues.
[13:03.200 --> 13:05.880]  And they weren't even that big an issue.
[13:05.880 --> 13:10.360]  But the mother said, hey, why don't you go to your school counselor and ask them about
[13:10.360 --> 13:12.080]  some of your boyfriend problems?
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.400]  You know, we're not going to go pay for you to go to some counselor in town or whatever.
[13:16.400 --> 13:17.400]  It's not the one against the money.
[13:17.400 --> 13:18.920]  It's just, hey, go to the school counselor.
[13:18.920 --> 13:20.920]  We pay property taxes for this.
[13:20.920 --> 13:22.640]  So this is the same high school.
[13:22.640 --> 13:27.440]  She's a freshman that I went to for the first few years of high school, but I moved to Austin
[13:27.440 --> 13:28.440]  when I was 16.
[13:28.440 --> 13:36.400]  And she goes into the school in Rockwall and it's a male counselor to a 13-year-old girl.
[13:36.400 --> 13:39.320]  And she told me the whole conversation.
[13:39.320 --> 13:42.800]  I guess her niece repeated it to her.
[13:42.800 --> 13:44.680]  She was shocked.
[13:44.680 --> 13:51.640]  He says to her, well, don't you think your problem is you're really a man?
[13:51.640 --> 13:54.680]  And by the way, she's an attractive, you know, very feminine girl.
[13:54.680 --> 13:55.680]  She goes, excuse me?
[13:55.680 --> 14:01.320]  And he goes, yes, you're having problems with this boyfriend here at school because
[14:01.320 --> 14:03.440]  you're really sexually confused.
[14:03.440 --> 14:07.800]  And she goes, no, he goes, yeah, I think you're a boy.
[14:07.800 --> 14:08.800]  And she goes, are you joking?
[14:08.800 --> 14:11.200]  He goes, no, I want to get you in touch with the group.
[14:11.200 --> 14:12.200]  We need to put you in counseling.
[14:12.200 --> 14:13.760]  They'll pay for it offsite.
[14:13.760 --> 14:15.800]  You really need this right now.
[14:15.800 --> 14:16.800]  And she goes, no, I'm a girl.
[14:16.800 --> 14:17.800]  He goes, no, you're not.
[14:17.800 --> 14:21.440]  And she pulls her shirt forward, looks down and says, no, I'm a girl and says, I'm getting
[14:21.440 --> 14:22.440]  out of here.
[14:22.440 --> 14:25.560]  Now, you get an autistic person or somebody else that wants attention.
[14:25.560 --> 14:26.560]  They get in there.
[14:26.560 --> 14:27.560]  They take them.
[14:27.560 --> 14:32.040]  They put them with a government counseling place that gets corporate money or vice versa.
[14:32.040 --> 14:36.120]  And they're making in Texas a loan over a billion dollars a year.
[14:36.120 --> 14:41.240]  I didn't even know this on counseling and gender reassignment in the Lone Star State.
[14:41.240 --> 14:44.680]  And it turns out the Republican party's involved, not just Democrats.
[14:44.680 --> 14:51.840]  So when you wonder how the legislature in Texas couldn't pass a law against chopping
[14:51.840 --> 14:58.600]  10-year-old boys' genitals off or boys' in girls' sports, it's because of money, money,
[14:58.600 --> 15:01.360]  money, money, money, money.
[15:01.360 --> 15:06.600]  But imagine she's not a troubled child, had a boyfriend issue.
[15:06.600 --> 15:10.120]  When you're 13, you don't want to so much talk to your mom, you know, who's the right
[15:10.120 --> 15:13.800]  wing, you know, Christian, but she's conservative, too.
[15:13.800 --> 15:17.960]  So talk to the counselor, and you don't even expect in Rockwall, Texas, a subscriber of
[15:17.960 --> 15:23.840]  Dallas, that you go there and a man is pushing on you.
[15:23.840 --> 15:27.840]  It went on and on for like 30 minutes, him saying, you are, by the end of it, he's like,
[15:27.840 --> 15:33.200]  you are a man, you are a man, you are a, you need to go to this place.
[15:33.200 --> 15:34.200]  They will help you.
[15:34.200 --> 15:38.240]  It's a whole agenda to destroy everybody, men, women, everybody.
[15:38.240 --> 15:39.240]  It's sick.
[15:39.240 --> 15:41.480]  It's how you depopulate.
[15:41.480 --> 15:45.480]  The same groups push Ritalin and put, you know, 50 million boys in America on it, and screwed
[15:45.480 --> 15:46.480]  up their brains and everything.
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.240]  I mean, these people know what they're doing, but it's one thing to put you on Ritalin or
[15:50.240 --> 15:51.240]  Prozac.
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.240]  Now they want to chop your balls off, or you have girls sterilize themselves.
[15:55.240 --> 16:00.720]  It's eugenics.
[16:00.720 --> 16:02.720]  Your voice counts.
[16:02.720 --> 16:07.720]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:07.720 --> 16:10.320]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:10.320 --> 16:11.820]  They know you're angry.
[16:11.820 --> 16:16.120]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[16:16.120 --> 16:17.120]  we've got.

[18:56.920 --> 18:57.920]  has.
[18:57.920 --> 18:58.920]  This stuff really, really works.
[18:58.920 --> 19:03.800]  One of the most common questions I get on-air, but also off-air when I'm just out and about
[19:03.800 --> 19:08.480]  is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines?
[19:08.480 --> 19:09.640]  How do I warn them?
[19:09.640 --> 19:13.640]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it, so many facts.
[19:13.640 --> 19:17.240]  It's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection
[19:17.240 --> 19:22.560]  in the US and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses
[19:22.560 --> 19:27.320]  and other things to vaccines, and the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk
[19:27.320 --> 19:31.960]  groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans, the list goes on and on, but what
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.800]  about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and so did the head of the CDC in late May
[19:37.800 --> 19:45.240]  of 2021, that around half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, virologist, scientists have
[19:45.240 --> 19:47.360]  refused to take the vaccine until they can save?
[19:47.360 --> 19:51.600]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it, that's the same thing in
[19:51.600 --> 19:55.120]  the private practices out there, similar numbers, that that's not something that will be taken.
[19:55.120 --> 19:56.840]  That's very, very simple.
[19:56.840 --> 20:02.040]  There's your answer.
[20:02.040 --> 20:32.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:32.000 --> 20:41.800]  Thanks to your support, InfoWars is back in black, they're still on air, thanks to your
[20:41.800 --> 20:42.800]  funding and your support.
[20:42.800 --> 20:46.560]  The first five months of this year it was looking bad, but you've come through, they've
[20:46.560 --> 20:51.120]  got a lot of product and a lot of support, so hopefully we can expand, not just stay
[20:51.120 --> 20:56.440]  at the same place, because we've proven that we're ready to take on the globalist with
[20:56.440 --> 21:02.360]  a devastating effect, so I salute you all, and speaking of that, then I'm going to go
[21:02.360 --> 21:03.360]  to this big news.
[21:03.360 --> 21:06.480]  I designed this shirt, I'm just telling you, not bragging, and I think it's one of my
[21:06.480 --> 21:11.720]  better designs than I did with the concept team, Robert and others over there, and it's
[21:11.720 --> 21:13.360]  just incredible.
[21:13.360 --> 21:19.200]  I didn't intend for it to basically glow in the dark like a tree frog can do some of
[21:19.200 --> 21:25.200]  the species, but it actually glows under these lights, under regular lights, we've got a
[21:25.200 --> 21:32.120]  black shirt, a green shirt, and a cream shirt, and on the back it says, save the frogs, infowars.com,
[21:32.120 --> 21:36.720]  and on the front of the shirt it's got the same little symbol over your heart, and I'm
[21:36.720 --> 21:40.920]  telling you, we've had these shirts in for almost a month, we hadn't gone on sale until
[21:40.920 --> 21:44.480]  the big shipment came in, because you get a test shirt, see if you approve it, and as
[21:44.480 --> 21:47.040]  soon as I wore this out, everybody goes, what's that shirt?
[21:47.040 --> 21:52.040]  I like that shirt, John, the boom operator, never talks about my shirts, he goes, what's
[21:52.040 --> 21:53.040]  that shirt?
[21:53.040 --> 21:54.040]  I love that shirt today.
[21:54.040 --> 21:59.560]  He wants one, my son, I was going to shoot an ad for these yesterday, he works up here,
[21:59.560 --> 22:04.600]  he comes in my office, he's been as big as I am for years, he's 18 now, but I thought
[22:04.600 --> 22:10.240]  he was 15, he's as big as I am, now he's huge, he wears XXL, and I see him walking around
[22:10.240 --> 22:15.400]  on my shirt, and I said, hey, you go to the warehouse down the road, you get one, you
[22:15.400 --> 22:19.520]  don't steal my shirt, so I'm telling you, this shirt's so popular, that everybody's
[22:19.520 --> 22:23.400]  going crazy over it, and I don't know why, but there's just something about little frogs,
[22:23.400 --> 22:27.720]  people like, and the frogs are getting sterile, they're dying, and it's because of the atrazine
[22:27.720 --> 22:33.400]  and other chemicals, they deliberately put in the water to basically shut down our fertility.
[22:33.400 --> 22:37.720]  I'm going to cover some news articles on this subject in a minute, because this is the heart
[22:37.720 --> 22:43.920]  of what we're facing, it's 1776 for the shirts, in cream, with a green frog, black with a
[22:43.920 --> 22:49.080]  green frog, and green with a green frog, and we've shot all these under cameras, they all
[22:49.080 --> 22:52.320]  look great, they're all very handsome shirts, they're very conservative looking shirts,
[22:52.320 --> 22:57.160]  they don't look shocking, they don't look aggressive, like my mass murders agree shirt
[22:57.160 --> 23:03.600]  that I first designed myself on a program like 25 years ago, computers were so slow
[23:03.600 --> 23:08.680]  back then, it took me like half a day to even get the images to stay where they were on
[23:08.680 --> 23:13.720]  photoshop, but it's Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, and it says mass murders agree, gun control
[23:13.720 --> 23:20.080]  works in full wars dot com, on the back it says, politicians love disarm peasants, because
[23:20.080 --> 23:26.440]  I saw that on a bumper sticker, well that's the original OG t-shirt, that has been around
[23:26.440 --> 23:32.320]  25 years, well the new frog shirt is not as aggressive, but it's a great way to educate
[23:32.320 --> 23:37.840]  people and expose what's going on, but just if you're a TV viewer, look at how it glows
[23:37.840 --> 23:42.360]  under the lights, I mean we hit a home run with this sucker, I think this is going to
[23:42.360 --> 23:47.400]  be a super best seller, it's also tongue in cheek, it's silly, and it's a great way to
[23:47.400 --> 23:53.640]  start conversations, and it's got the dreaded in full wars dot com on it as well, so let's
[23:53.640 --> 23:59.760]  talk about what's really going on, and they talk about this in club of Rome documents,
[23:59.760 --> 24:05.520]  CFR documents, state apartment memorandum 200, they talk about it, I'm giving you all
[24:05.520 --> 24:10.400]  the documents right now, they talk about it in eco science, written by Obama, science
[24:10.400 --> 24:14.760]  are of how they put chemicals in the food and water to lower male masculinity to make
[24:14.760 --> 24:19.400]  us more manageable, and also lower our sperm rates, they use phthalates in the plastic
[24:19.400 --> 24:24.400]  liners and the juice box liners and all the rest of it, that's why we got to get back
[24:24.400 --> 24:30.760]  to glass, and that's also what they do with the atrazine that the EPA makes them basically
[24:30.760 --> 24:34.920]  add to fuel they claim for the environment, when it just kills animals and humans and
[24:34.920 --> 24:39.600]  gives us cancer and sterilizes us everywhere, and they also put again phthalates in the
[24:39.600 --> 24:44.200]  plastics that they don't have to put in there, for the same price or less they can make other
[24:44.200 --> 24:50.760]  plastic formulas that are not toxic, but they do worldwide with standardization, so you
[24:50.760 --> 24:54.880]  don't hear the Democrats wanting to ban that, oh no they want carbon dioxide that plants
[24:54.880 --> 24:58.880]  breathe so they can tax everything on earth and track it and control it, they don't want
[24:58.880 --> 25:04.000]  to stop GMO or animal human clones, which the Democrats legalized last Tuesday, kind
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.440]  of a big deal, oh we legalized animal human clones because we've already been doing it
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.440]  for 30 years, they said, I told you 50, but the articles are like we really been doing
[25:13.440 --> 25:19.200]  it for 30 years, ha ha ha everybody's like Alex Jones is right, you think I'm happy
[25:19.200 --> 25:26.360]  to be right about that, I didn't just become right, it was always admitted, they were cloning
[25:26.360 --> 25:33.440]  animals and humans before I was born, Hitler was cloning rabbits in 1944, they've been
[25:33.440 --> 25:39.320]  splicing animals and humans, it went on sale this week, salmon that weighed twice as much
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.680]  and aren't salmon, they're part insect and part asparagus for whatever reason, I'm not
[25:43.680 --> 25:49.000]  kidding, they have asparagus in, they was walking stick genes in it, they won't say
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.640]  why, they won't say why the Pfizer shot has the jellyfish genome in it, they just go trust
[25:53.640 --> 25:59.800]  us, imagine a Cobra Commander G.I. Joe episode where like Cobra is, I'd convince everyone
[25:59.800 --> 26:04.640]  to take an injection and not even ask what it is, but if you must ask it's the genome
[26:04.640 --> 26:11.720]  of a human, a dead boy and a jellyfish, the Cobra strikes and you roll up your sleeves
[26:11.720 --> 26:18.880]  and die, can't make it up, so I mentioned this yesterday, but let me just show you what
[26:18.880 --> 26:22.360]  we're talking about, then I'll hit all the main news when we come back, okay this is
[26:22.360 --> 26:30.160]  out of Japan's national daily, their biggest newspaper, daily newspaper, researchers in
[26:30.160 --> 26:39.320]  Japan use soybean compound to make catfish 100% female, oh but the school lunch program
[26:39.320 --> 26:44.400]  makes sure it's soy, including whole soybean ground and it's the heart of the soybean that
[26:44.400 --> 26:52.080]  has this super toxic compound that will, if a woman eats this in the first trimester,
[26:52.080 --> 26:56.880]  her baby boy will have micro genitals and almost no testosterone and will be a genetic
[26:56.880 --> 27:02.200]  unique and that is what the soy boys are, they also tested this on monkeys, three different
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.880]  species and found that they make the same weird smiling face, they're aggressive and
[27:06.880 --> 27:14.600]  hateful loners, very unsuccessful and tend to try to then kill females, think I'm joking?
[27:14.600 --> 27:20.000]  Long term soy consumption makes monkeys aggressive loners, shocking study with possible human
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.720]  implications, there they are and they again run around soy boing and eating their poop,
[27:26.720 --> 27:32.880]  I'm not joking, oh that's in the study, mercury poisoning makes male birds homosexual, ever
[27:32.880 --> 27:39.440]  heard mad as a hatter, so that's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen and it's all
[27:39.440 --> 27:45.640]  by design, then they got to make it cool when suddenly nobody can have children, everybody's
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.720]  falling apart and dying, I never even got to this yesterday but you guys pull it out
[27:50.720 --> 27:55.760]  of my stack, blues clues didn't just have the drag queen story time, a big fat, you
[27:55.760 --> 28:01.040]  know, pedo style looking dude, one of them was also wearing the exact headdress of Mollick
[28:01.040 --> 28:05.760]  the Bull, which should be interchangeable as an owl but the point is that's, and there's
[28:05.760 --> 28:11.600]  a huge Mollock Bull that you would sacrifice children to and then gay frogs hopping around
[28:11.600 --> 28:16.160]  everywhere and gay sharks and everything else because the whole planet's going to die under
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.800]  the system, yes there will be no more, no more reproduction and now the rainbow flag
[28:20.800 --> 28:24.920]  is the symbol of eternal death, to them, I mean the globalists say that, it's in my
[28:24.920 --> 28:30.280]  film in game that they would promote homosexuality all this to not have children, but don't
[28:30.280 --> 28:34.320]  worry you'll be able to grow a child in a cloning tank soon so our journey towards being
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.600]  a commodity will be complete, they call it love, it's so loving, you must embrace the
[28:39.600 --> 28:43.920]  robot takeover, you must accept the animal human clones or you're bad and there's the
[28:43.920 --> 28:47.880]  Mollock, see the calf right there with the actual Mollock horns and they're going to

[30:56.240 --> 31:01.080]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[31:01.080 --> 31:02.080]  Hey Alex.
[31:02.080 --> 31:06.280]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all
[31:06.280 --> 31:10.320]  this stupidity, wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year,
[31:10.320 --> 31:17.400]  okay, I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away,
[31:17.400 --> 31:22.680]  living defense saved my life, they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[31:22.680 --> 31:28.520]  me, living defense brought me back, I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying
[31:28.520 --> 31:34.320]  as to where we are right now, this is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you
[31:34.320 --> 31:41.640]  up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's
[31:41.640 --> 31:47.000]  sake, and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.280]  another, that's right where we're at brother.
[31:49.280 --> 31:53.720]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and
[31:53.720 --> 32:00.520]  that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[32:00.520 --> 32:26.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[32:26.520 --> 32:52.760]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, okay, I have never seen
[32:52.760 --> 33:04.640]  Joe Biden taken to the woodshed like he was and when I saw this last night on infowars.com
[33:04.640 --> 33:12.000]  I'm asking the crew to repost it under the live show feed today, so it has its own article
[33:12.000 --> 33:17.240]  again because the article is posted at infowars.com and it's since rolled down the page halfway
[33:17.240 --> 33:22.520]  wow and wow is right, a lot of people say wow and it's not worth a wow.
[33:22.520 --> 33:28.360]  This Kellen McBrane article is worth a wow, wow, wow.
[33:28.360 --> 33:37.280]  Judge Joe Brown unloads on racist Joe Biden and corrupt witch Kamala and it's got like
[33:37.280 --> 33:42.520]  10 million views online, millions on YouTube, I mean it is devastating and here's the key
[33:42.520 --> 33:48.600]  to this, Judge Brown is respected but I don't just respect Brown and know that he's a good
[33:48.600 --> 33:53.440]  truthful past and stands up for father's rights and things like that.
[33:53.440 --> 33:58.480]  When I saw this, it made me mad last night because I already knew all this stuff and
[33:58.480 --> 34:04.000]  I'm so sick of looking at Joe Biden that I didn't go even dig all this up during the
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.760]  Trump campaign because I knew they were just going to still be election.
[34:08.760 --> 34:16.800]  But now he's in and what Brown says you can actually go dig up and find and so half of
[34:16.800 --> 34:21.840]  me doesn't even want to air this next segment because I want to go get the clips, I want
[34:21.840 --> 34:25.880]  to find the news articles with the quotes because that's how my brain works.
[34:25.880 --> 34:30.120]  Everything Brown said, I watched the clip, it's an hour plus interview but I watched
[34:30.120 --> 34:36.600]  the nine minute boil down twice that I'm going to play part of next segment.
[34:36.600 --> 34:44.000]  But when you listen to this and you know the backstory, Brown's telling the total truth
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.240]  about Kamala, every damn thing he says about her is true, every damn thing he says about
[34:48.240 --> 34:55.560]  Biden is true and it's scary.
[34:55.560 --> 35:00.440]  Not just that they're both crazy people and racist against blacks, you got to know Indians
[35:00.440 --> 35:05.240]  are nice folks but they have a caste system and if you got dark skin you're like, they're
[35:05.240 --> 35:10.840]  getting rid of that but you know you're subhuman, it's a thing and he explains that that she's
[35:10.840 --> 35:16.600]  an Aryan and that the white Aryans get confused by that but he really knows what he's talking
[35:16.600 --> 35:19.760]  about so I'm really impressed and I've seen this show before years ago and I've seen
[35:19.760 --> 35:24.200]  interviews he's done and agree with a lot of stuff he says but man, I am impressed with
[35:24.200 --> 35:28.880]  Brown and so that's the next segment because it ties into everything but I'm going to have
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.240]  that whole article reposted under the live show feed of the broadcast today, can we put
[35:33.240 --> 35:37.120]  the live show feed up because that takes us to our next big point and I'm going to be
[35:37.120 --> 35:42.240]  hitting next hour that is so huge you can bring down the whole new world order and that
[35:42.240 --> 35:49.560]  is it's official, it's now coming out like I told you that the communist Chinese government
[35:49.560 --> 35:59.560]  isn't just funding most universities, isn't just buying out the politicians but it owns
[35:59.560 --> 36:04.640]  most of the mainstream media, not just four of the six production houses but spends bub-bub
[36:04.640 --> 36:12.880]  billions on major newspapers, I mean you know the Washington Post was paid to say G.G.
[36:12.880 --> 36:16.840]  Ping should destroy Trump to save America, I mean only the Chi Coms would come up with
[36:16.840 --> 36:25.560]  that, you know who's funding all the race war stuff, Bingo, the Chinese communists do
[36:25.560 --> 36:29.760]  not respect black people at all, they don't respect Biden either, they wouldn't even talk
[36:29.760 --> 36:32.440]  to him or meet with him, they wouldn't even meet with the Secretary of Defense because
[36:32.440 --> 36:36.320]  he's black, I mean I'm sorry, nothing against the folks in China but it is the most racist
[36:36.320 --> 36:38.880]  country in the world, I mean if you're not even Chinese most of them won't even deal
[36:38.880 --> 36:46.480]  with you, that's how it is but communist China is funding, why do you think there's a hundred
[36:46.480 --> 36:50.320]  movies out the last few years about whites killing black people and all this promotion
[36:50.320 --> 36:55.200]  of the Tulsa massacre and all this crap, because China sees that as a way to divide our country
[36:55.200 --> 37:01.440]  period and when the new black panther party morons go out there and say kill all the
[37:01.440 --> 37:08.200]  white people, they're just playing right into the divide and conquer, so that's coming
[37:08.200 --> 37:11.880]  up next hour, it's huge and I got the even bigger Fauci news that I'm going to cover
[37:11.880 --> 37:17.000]  here before this segment ends but then I'm going to hit the Judge Brown news coming up
[37:17.000 --> 37:24.800]  next segment, but this is a big deal, I mean you have to understand, people go okay well
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.040]  Biden's been on the Chinese payroll, what's the big deal, they're black mailing him with
[37:28.040 --> 37:32.640]  it, when you take the money it's not about the money, it's about you can be destroyed,
[37:32.640 --> 37:39.000]  they can snap their fingers and that's dangerous as hell and there's a billion and a half Chinese
[37:39.000 --> 37:45.080]  folks who are slaves of their government but they got one thing, national pride, they hate
[37:45.080 --> 37:49.760]  the Koreans, they hate the Japanese, the Japanese hate them, I mean again the left has taught
[37:49.760 --> 37:53.760]  us that the only tribalism is in America, America and Europe's where we tried to get
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.120]  rid of the tribalism and now the globalists have double crossed and are using the fact
[37:58.120 --> 38:01.800]  that we're not tribal at all because it's great to not be tribal if nobody is, but
[38:01.800 --> 38:06.440]  if you're not tribal and you're a guy across the road's tribal, he's going to come take
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.160]  you over and it's not blacks they're getting ready to come take over from the whites, it's
[38:11.160 --> 38:15.400]  the elites playing us off against each other to take us all over and everybody deep down
[38:15.400 --> 38:21.760]  knows that's true and Trump tried to reverse this and help all Americans and the globalists
[38:21.760 --> 38:25.040]  got pissed.
[38:25.040 --> 38:29.040]  We had a straight shooter for four years, wasn't perfect, but he meant well, we got
[38:29.040 --> 38:36.320]  people that are bit by design and crookeder than a barrel of snakes and the wheels are
[38:36.320 --> 38:41.120]  coming off and it's all coming out.
[38:41.120 --> 38:47.200]  Let's hit some of these headlines right now, we'll get more into this after I cover the
[38:47.200 --> 38:50.520]  race war they're trying to trigger this summer, they got a good chance of doing it, we got
[38:50.520 --> 38:55.600]  to stop it, that's coming up first 30 months the next hour, then I'm going to hit the China
[38:55.600 --> 38:56.600]  information.
[38:56.600 --> 38:59.120]  Let's get into this right now.
[38:59.120 --> 39:06.720]  In February 2020 email Fauci wrote, face mask is not effective in keeping out virus.
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.640]  Fauci was told early on that Wuhan coronavirus looked engineered, didn't look engineered
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.360]  they could look at it under electron microscopes and see it been sliced together.
[39:16.360 --> 39:21.080]  Zero Hedge is an excellent article because they were the first to come out with it.
[39:21.080 --> 39:29.360]  Before me, before Dr. Boyle, we of course went further but it's not about credit, but
[39:29.360 --> 39:30.360]  it is.
[39:30.360 --> 39:33.280]  I'm not going to take credit for being the first when I'm not.
[39:33.280 --> 39:35.320]  We just built the biggest platform to get the truth out.
[39:35.320 --> 39:39.480]  We're the cannon that got the shell loaded at it, you're the cannon, I'm the cannon
[39:39.480 --> 39:45.600]  to get the word out, but we're all on the same team and Zero Hedgeman MVP when it comes
[39:45.600 --> 39:46.600]  to getting this out.
[39:46.600 --> 39:50.680]  You'll see the original censored article they got banned off Twitter for with the Indian
[39:50.680 --> 39:54.360]  Institute that scanned the virus and the French Institute, the Australian Institute scanned
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.400]  it and they threatened to pull all their funding so they pulled it, but now it's all confirmed.
[39:59.400 --> 40:03.480]  That's what you're now hearing breaking on ABC News that it was five viruses and six
[40:03.480 --> 40:06.520]  inserts and here it is.
[40:06.520 --> 40:12.160]  Fauci emails revealed damage control scrambling at Zero Hedge Spotlight's manmade COVID-19
[40:12.160 --> 40:13.160]  theory.
[40:13.160 --> 40:14.560]  It's not a theory.
[40:14.560 --> 40:15.680]  It's a proven fact.
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.640]  They were funding it, the exact viruses, they were testing it to then force the world on
[40:19.640 --> 40:23.240]  a vaccine that would then actually kill you.
[40:23.240 --> 40:28.800]  And Fauci funded it in China, in Texas, in North Carolina, all over the world he did
[40:28.800 --> 40:30.840]  the illegal stuff and we have all the emails now.
[40:30.840 --> 40:31.840]  It's all coming out.
[40:31.840 --> 40:36.520]  You see, if you're going to launch a bio attack, you better be in control of the UN, you better
[40:36.520 --> 40:39.960]  be in control of the NIH, you better be in control through Bill Gates of all the health
[40:39.960 --> 40:44.280]  services so you can cover it up and you better have big tech censor everybody or you're
[40:44.280 --> 40:47.720]  ass is going to prison.
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.840]  Under the Nuremberg Code, if you're tried and convicted, you get walked up to the gallows
[40:52.840 --> 40:59.920]  pole because the time is coming when people that do this stuff will be punished not by
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.880]  me but by justice through the courts and I told you it would come a year ago and you
[41:04.880 --> 41:06.280]  see it starting, don't you?
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.760]  The snowball's too big, too much energy, you killed too many people, Fauci Gates, you
[41:11.760 --> 41:20.160]  will pay, I see it in the stars, I see it in the cards, I see it in the tea leaves,
[41:20.160 --> 41:31.080]  I see it in the bones, in the runes my dear, your fall, your destruction, justice is right,
[41:31.080 --> 41:33.520]  it is coming.
[41:33.520 --> 41:38.760]  Email researcher who funded Wuhan lab admitted to manipulating coronavirus, thanks Fauci
[41:38.760 --> 41:45.080]  for covering up lab leak.
[41:45.080 --> 41:49.240]  Liberty's group warns people being convicted without trial for lockdown breaches, well
[41:49.240 --> 41:54.320]  sure the lockdown's martial law, why not get rid of trials all together in the UK?
[41:54.320 --> 41:56.800]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[41:56.800 --> 42:01.560]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where info wars is and it's
[42:01.560 --> 42:06.080]  always a complex picture but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons
[42:06.080 --> 42:11.680]  that make all this possible, so in short the world's awakening, the spiral of censorship,
[42:11.680 --> 42:16.480]  info wars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing
[42:16.480 --> 42:21.600]  the global's agenda and fighting it, but that said the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.280]  chains has almost shut us down because most of us selling products which you want to buy
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.800]  like DNA Force Plus and others have been sold out for up to seven months, well guess what?
[42:30.800 --> 42:36.360]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank god for seven months, it's 40% off, it's amazing,
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.680]  at infowarsore.com and for the week leading up through Memorial Day we have store-wide
[42:40.680 --> 42:45.960]  free shipping and double patriot points and alpha powers back in stock and supermilitalies
[42:45.960 --> 42:51.120]  back in stock and pollen block and vaso beach, they're all back in stock as much as 50% off,
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.440]  store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, infowarsore.com, thanks for keeping us on
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.040]  the air, info warriors.
[42:59.040 --> 43:06.040]  Here's our champions made of, here's a man who can show you,
[43:29.040 --> 43:36.040]  here's our champions made of, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can show
[43:59.040 --> 44:06.040]  you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can
[44:29.040 --> 44:36.040]  show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can
[44:59.040 --> 45:06.040]  show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can
[45:29.040 --> 45:36.040]  show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can
[45:59.040 --> 46:06.040]  show you, here's our champions made of, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can
[46:29.040 --> 46:36.040]  show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can
[46:59.040 --> 47:06.040]  show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can
[47:29.040 --> 47:42.040]  show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can show you, here's a man who can
[47:42.040 --> 47:48.760]  say it's Gates and Fauci or they are going to have to pay and of course obviously China
[47:48.760 --> 47:53.320]  allowed it to be set up there. China was heavily involved. Their military was in the building.
[47:53.320 --> 47:55.640]  They did this because they were mad at Trump. They did this because they were losing the
[47:55.640 --> 48:00.080]  trade war. They did this because they knew our media would shut us down and they would
[48:00.080 --> 48:05.520]  stay open. But now there's enough instinct left in America and the American establishment
[48:05.520 --> 48:13.040]  isn't 100% globalist that now the real war has begun economically, culturally, spiritually
[48:13.040 --> 48:18.960]  and probably physically. And you're going to see globalist insiders, Biden saying it's
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.240]  Russian hackers because the real war is between the U.S. and China saying, oh, the Russians
[48:23.240 --> 48:27.720]  cut off our meat packing. Oh, the Russians cut off our keystone pipeline. Oh, no, that
[48:27.720 --> 48:34.280]  was you, Biden. The Russians cut off the colonial pipeline. And then a week later, he whispers
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.400]  oh, actually no evidence Russians were involved. But always the big announcement, Russians
[48:38.400 --> 48:42.720]  did it. And again, I'm not a Russophile. I've never been to Russia, but I've studied history
[48:42.720 --> 48:47.400]  and I know the Russians can barely keep Soros from taking them over. They're just like us.
[48:47.400 --> 48:52.800]  They are just like us. They've got globalists. They've got leftists. They've got pedophiles
[48:52.800 --> 48:58.000]  trying to take over. They've got devil worshipers, except Putin says we're fighting devil worshippers,
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.760]  child molesters. We're fighting George Soros who's a Satanist because they are. And that's
[49:03.760 --> 49:08.960]  why they go the Russians. That's why Hollywood hates Russia because the globalist had Russia
[49:08.960 --> 49:15.640]  on its knees, sucking their blood for 75 years. And now they don't get to do that as much.
[49:15.640 --> 49:23.000]  Russia is at least fighting back. Russia is not free of these people. Either way, the
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.800]  hacking is all deep state globalists. It's all J.P. Morgan Chase. It's all Goldman Sachs.
[49:28.800 --> 49:33.360]  They are directing the Chinese and they're beta testing totally shutting us off. I mean,
[49:33.360 --> 49:38.440]  we're in trouble because it's the Islamics with communist China, the EU, Hollywood, the
[49:38.440 --> 49:46.000]  blue cities, the blue states, the UN all against America and Russia. And that means the American
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.240]  people and the Russian people and the Brazilian people turned out the guy posing as a patriot,
[49:52.240 --> 50:00.800]  Boris Johnson was a total scumbag. So UK's awake tried to bring it, but Johnson hijacked
[50:00.800 --> 50:04.760]  the movement. And now for Rogers admitted that Johnson lied to him and Johnson's bad.
[50:04.760 --> 50:09.600]  But we got Brazil a little bit. We got the U.S. a little bit. We got the UK a little
[50:09.600 --> 50:15.080]  bit. We got Russia a lot. We got Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic. Man, you turn on
[50:15.080 --> 50:20.280]  their TV. Let me tell you. On Russian TV, on Czech TV, on Polish TV, guess who's on
[50:20.280 --> 50:26.080]  their TV every day? Me. And it's not because they listen to what I say. They know what
[50:26.080 --> 50:31.080]  I'm saying. It's true. They've been through it. They don't need me to tell them. They
[50:31.080 --> 50:37.040]  just hear me go, oh, yeah, he's right because they lived it. I said, I was going to hit
[50:37.040 --> 50:42.600]  this Judge Brown stuff, which is just over the fricking top, man. He had to sit there
[50:42.600 --> 50:48.600]  and watch Joe Biden give a speech pointing at black people, call them cockroaches because
[50:48.600 --> 50:52.400]  that's what it used to be like. And I'm not bashing Northerners. Northerners are great
[50:52.400 --> 50:58.080]  people, but you always grow up in the south and northeast Texas is the edge of the south.
[50:58.080 --> 51:02.640]  It's almost, it's like deep south, but it's its own kind of crazy south. As you go out
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.360]  more into west Texas, it's no longer the south. It's more western. But I mean, I grew
[51:06.360 --> 51:11.040]  up never hearing the n-word, never hearing bad talk about black people. Slavery was a
[51:11.040 --> 51:14.760]  shameful thing. It's Christians. We wanted to help people. And that was everybody I knew.
[51:14.760 --> 51:19.960]  I went deer hunting with all the World War II vets, everybody. But when I started going
[51:19.960 --> 51:23.480]  up north to Michigan, and I'm not bashing folks up there, but everybody knows I'm telling
[51:23.480 --> 51:28.560]  the truth and to New York and New Jersey and places, my Lord, I would think it was like
[51:28.560 --> 51:32.760]  a test to see if I was racist. They're like, no, no, we don't like these F and N words
[51:32.760 --> 51:35.680]  and all this other stuff. And then the black guys didn't like them either. They were all
[51:35.680 --> 51:41.680]  killing each other because that's big northern cities like Chicago and New York is tribal.
[51:41.680 --> 51:47.520]  That's how you see the gangs of New York with Scorsese. It's done stylized, but it's exactly,
[51:47.520 --> 51:51.440]  those are real people in that movie. That was based on real stuff went on. It was a composite.
[51:51.440 --> 51:56.440]  That was all real. And how did they control people with different gangs, the Protestant
[51:56.440 --> 52:05.440]  gang, the Catholic gang, the black gang, the Hispanic gang? That's how it all was. And
[52:05.440 --> 52:08.880]  people were, I mean, they had fights where hundreds would kill each other. You think
[52:08.880 --> 52:13.320]  the Tulsa massacre was the only thing that went on? You know, I'd tell you some stories
[52:13.320 --> 52:17.960]  that are in our family Bible. It was passed down, but I'm not even going to get into it.
[52:17.960 --> 52:22.600]  But I grew up, my grandmother, people telling me what really went on and how we left Alabama
[52:22.600 --> 52:29.080]  to come to Texas on my dad's side in the early 1830s on my mom's side in the 1820s from New
[52:29.080 --> 52:34.360]  York City as Christian missionaries literally started the whole deal with a million ways.
[52:34.360 --> 52:41.440]  The point is, is that I've done my studying. I know what's going on and all they're doing
[52:41.440 --> 52:46.120]  is trying to get us to all kill each other while they rule over us. And it's that simple.
[52:46.120 --> 52:56.160]  So I'll get to the judge brown stuff that is over the top and a key. If people can understand
[52:56.160 --> 52:59.080]  this, they can understand everything. Then we can get this out to white folks, black
[52:59.080 --> 53:03.880]  folks, everybody, and it is going viral. You will totally understand why Biden's doing
[53:03.880 --> 53:07.920]  what he's doing, saying whites are the number one enemy, white supremacists are going to
[53:07.920 --> 53:14.400]  kill you. It's because he has been a white supremacist and use that for political control
[53:14.400 --> 53:21.680]  because that was the old system that the Democrats used. And now that's his flank, his underside
[53:21.680 --> 53:26.800]  is Kamala saying, Hey, you're a racist and everybody says, Oh, how dare you? So he's
[53:26.800 --> 53:31.720]  got to divert from what he's done while he sells out the communist Chinese by saying
[53:31.720 --> 53:36.640]  the number one threat in America isn't open borders, isn't inflation, isn't Iran, isn't
[53:36.640 --> 53:44.880]  communist China? It's white people that are going to kill everybody. What the hell? I
[53:44.880 --> 53:48.880]  mean, statistically, whites killing blacks is one of the rarest deaths in the United
[53:48.880 --> 53:54.840]  States. But when it does happen, the media celebrates it to again, create the division.
[53:54.840 --> 53:59.040]  But I got shook up when when they're in the break, they brought me this article. So I was
[53:59.040 --> 54:03.240]  already going to get into China and go into three child policy and how they're breaking
[54:03.240 --> 54:08.640]  away from the globalist. And I was already planning today. In fact, I intended I was
[54:08.640 --> 54:14.000]  having a conversation at the Memorial Day cookout of my parents. And I said war with
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.640]  China is coming. And I intended on Tuesday show to come and have that be the headline.
[54:19.640 --> 54:23.880]  And I just didn't do it. But I mean, everybody knows it. It's not like I'm like, I'm telling
[54:23.880 --> 54:26.120]  you something, you don't know, I see thunder clouds coming in, you know, there's gonna
[54:26.120 --> 54:31.800]  be rain. But I mean, this is on this is going down. It's already happening through proxies
[54:31.800 --> 54:39.320]  and in between India and Pakistan is the proxy war between us and China. And it's not enough
[54:39.320 --> 54:43.520]  that the Chinese control Biden, because they don't fully control the military industrial
[54:43.520 --> 54:48.200]  complex and a bunch of other interests. And China double crossed the globalist on multiple
[54:48.200 --> 54:51.760]  fronts. They're not doing the one child policy. They're they're they're they're they're expanding
[54:51.760 --> 54:57.080]  their military, not just dominating economic systems. And Biden can't serve them enough
[54:57.080 --> 55:00.520]  when he announces, hey, we won't build any of our own batteries, we'll only buy it from
[55:00.520 --> 55:05.400]  China. We won't let Americans mine. And I'll shut and now Biden announced a plan to shut
[55:05.400 --> 55:10.400]  down 30 plus other big pipelines, giving the states the power to shut down existing pipelines
[55:10.400 --> 55:14.800]  and to give Whitmer the power to violate a US treaty and shut off the main pipeline
[55:14.800 --> 55:21.600]  to the Midwest out of Canada. I mean, we are under shot, come attack. So of course, he's
[55:21.600 --> 55:27.000]  running to Tulsa 100 years ago, people killed each other hundreds dead. Let's have a race
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.480]  war. How obvious is this? I'm going to go to break. We're going to come back. Please
[55:32.480 --> 55:36.520]  don't forget we're extending the store wide free shipping and double patriot points until

[57:08.360 --> 57:12.320]  a certain percentage and I said, just like the body's ultimate turmeric formula for the
[57:12.320 --> 57:17.000]  average competitors at five percent of humanoid. I said, no one else does 95. That's the highest
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.160]  level. I said, give me 95 percent of humanoid. Didn't even cost much more and we have 95
[57:22.160 --> 57:27.600]  percent of humanoid. Well, it's the same thing here. This is a very strong beat extract and

[57:49.280 --> 57:52.680]  an ad right now and I've been here on the Saturday cutting these. I'm going to terrible
[57:52.680 --> 57:59.200]  job because I just cut like five ads and I didn't tell people the most important part.
[57:59.200 --> 58:04.480]  No, it's not that DNA force plus has been sold out for seven months and it's back in
[58:04.480 --> 58:09.160]  stock and it's 40% off or how the supply chain broke down and how it almost bankrupted us.

[58:18.200 --> 58:23.160]  No, it's not that reason I just cut all those ads and forgot the most important point. The

[58:44.120 --> 58:51.000]  top of the huge sales.
[58:51.000 --> 59:16.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:16.120 --> 59:23.880]  You heard the term. I know you've all heard it. Camels nose under the 10th lap. Boy, communist
[59:23.880 --> 59:31.680]  China isn't under the 10th lap. It is inside the 10th. But then you pull back and it's
[59:31.680 --> 59:40.280]  a little worse than that. It's the straw that broke the camel's back. If you go to today's
[59:40.280 --> 59:47.960]  show headline info wars.com, it basically says going from memory here, Americans awakened
[59:47.960 --> 59:57.560]  the people awakened. There it is. The people awakened to the communist Chinese takeover
[59:57.560 --> 1:00:03.760]  and the globalist are scared. So that's what the whole show is really supposed to be about.
[1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:08.320]  But I went off into endocrine disruptors and how they're sterilizing us, which is just
[1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:16.120]  as important. That's the slow kill. But how about a hot kill? China state media says country
[1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:22.040]  must prepare for nuclear war with the US after Biden asked for COVID probe. Because if China
[1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:29.320]  launched that on purpose, that's an act of war. And China says, fine, let's go on to
[1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:35.800]  war and they've had high level generals and high level professors. Just the last two weeks
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:41.200]  say, yeah, we want to buy a war with you. What are you going to do? Because they control
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:46.160]  our media. They control academia. The average leftist thinks hating America's cool. They
[1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:51.120]  think sitting around on their ass watching Netflix for the last year or whatever was
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:01:00.520]  fun. And so they really think they're on the Chinese communist team, even though they're
[1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:07.960]  just shmuck useful idiots as Lenin would call them. And so that's where we are. And China
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:15.880]  is putting troops in the Caribbean. They've got patrol ships off the Atlantic seaboard.
[1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:18.800]  And they're announcing how they're going to crush us and how they're going to kill us.
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:26.240]  And we went to war with them in the Korean War. And the head general at that time, MacArthur
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:31.480]  tried to stop them with nuclear weapons and take out the Chinese communists, but the president
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:35.880]  Harry Truman at the time had been part of the CIA system. He supported it until then,
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:41.720]  later he didn't. Taking over China and they relieved MacArthur of his command. So that
[1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:47.480]  communist Chinese nightmare was put there by the globalist, put there by British intelligence,
[1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:52.200]  put there by the CIA, put there to be a management team they could work with so they could enslave
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:56.640]  the Chinese people. Because I wouldn't mind it, you know, the China being a dominant country
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:00.760]  in the world with its people and hard work and everything, if it wasn't communist and
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:08.120]  wasn't anti-human and anti-God. But instead you got a billion, 500 million slaves, you
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:15.200]  got a million communist party members in China that rule over those people. And they're
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:22.400]  about the law. And they now are preparing for war for the United States. So this is just
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:27.440]  absolutely insane. This is a short segment. When I come back, I'm going to read you this
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:32.800]  and I'm going to tie it together with the other big article about Kellan Green. It's
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:37.780]  also even in the Associated Press having to report exposed China paid American media
[1:02:37.780 --> 1:02:43.240]  outlets millions to publish propaganda. They would tell them what to publish. Remember,
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:47.640]  they're on the campaign. They attacked Trump. They attacked me. And you would see the same
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:51.120]  talking point. I would go check Twitter just for, you know, the interest of it. There'd
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:57.160]  be like suddenly 300 articles attacking me with some insane lie. And I would go on air
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:02.360]  and I'd say, that's Chinese communists right there. I'd be watching a movie. And it would
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:06.520]  all be about China rules the earth and America's bad and be a major Hollywood movie. And I'd
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:10.880]  say, oh, let me guess, a Chinese-owned company owns the production house. I'd search the
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:16.640]  name of the credits. Boom. It'd be right there. And there's seven thousands of times, thousands.
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:20.240]  I mean, I remember like, I got seven things like, hey, this episode of Good Doctor, it's
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:27.840]  on ABC News, ABC, has a character based on you who's an idiot and sells poison supplements.
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:32.320]  And I looked at the end, I said, who produced that? And it was Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:37.640]  Right there in the credits was a subgroup that's their foundation. I mean, a whole TV show
[1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:41.840]  with millions of dollars of budget, all just to attack me. That's how Bill Gates was. And
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:47.480]  I love that. That's good. It means I'm exposing them. It means I'm doing my job. I'm over
[1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:52.120]  the target. All right, we'll be right back on the other side to plunge into the biggest
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:55.920]  news ever. Stay with us.
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:04:00.440]  A lot of virtue signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:04.240]  much they care about veterans. But at the same time, they won't stand up for what those
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:09.920]  veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of US history. And now
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:14.720]  more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack. America
[1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:20.880]  is under globalist takeover. It's an information war. It is an economic war. But most importantly,
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:27.560]  it is a spiritual war. And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:31.200]  vaccines. We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan. We were the first
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:36.160]  to tell you that vaccine passports were coming. We were the first to lay out basically everything
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:39.440]  because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about. And that's why it's
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:43.400]  important to keep info wars in the air now more than ever. And for Memorial Day week,
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:47.040]  we're having store wide free shipping and double patriot points. A lot of great products
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:51.880]  are back at stock by DNA force, alpha power and pollen block. So to all the veterans,
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:54.800]  all the patriots, we salute you. And I want to ask the listeners, please support info
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:05:04.880]  wars now more than ever.
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:14.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:39.560]  So a lot of people want to sit on the sidelines of their lives thinking they're not in the
[1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:49.200]  danger zone. In my experience, people in the danger zone are those on the sidelines. Being
[1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:55.640]  born is a condition that leads to death. You could say that life is a disease that ends
[1:05:55.640 --> 1:06:02.880]  in death. But really, it's a gift that ends in transcendence. But we are all in the danger
[1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:09.000]  zone now. So let me as succinctly and calmly as I can explain what's currently happening
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:17.720]  that sends large chills up and down my spine and makes my skin crawl. There was a project
[1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:22.160]  of the British Empire that was collapsing at the end of World War II to merge with the
[1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:27.760]  United States. The project had already been begun in earnest in 1922 with the establishment
[1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:32.280]  of the Council on Foreign Relations and a Cecil Rhodes plan for private corporate world
[1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:36.960]  government where the nation states collapse into a world government. Common as China at
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:43.000]  the end of World War II had a chance to have a nationalist government in that would have
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:49.320]  built them up and industrialized them and been freer. The CIA newly minted in 1947 by
[1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:53.640]  British intelligence. British intelligence found the CIA with Yale's Cullin-Bones members
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:07:03.160]  who were also anglophiles. They set up, and basically royalists, they set up what is now
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:09.680]  currently the world order. They put Mao Zedong into power in 49. They betrayed Xi Jinping
[1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:17.280]  and made them evacuate to Hong Kong and of course some of them to Taiwan. Mao was put
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:21.480]  in power. They killed over 100 million of their own people. They carried out eugenics
[1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:24.960]  operations. They carried out every horrible thing you can imagine. David Rockefeller
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:32.760]  oversaw it with Mao, praised Mao and helped set up a system, wrote New York Times editorials
[1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:37.880]  about it all. Then by the 70s they publicly opened up China and made public the deal that
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:43.560]  had always been there. There had been a fight between the two groups in the Korean War,
[1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:48.440]  but again they had gotten back together after that. MacArthur was stopped from defeating
[1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:53.840]  the communist Chinese at the end of the Korean War and the armistice was signed to cease fire
[1:07:53.840 --> 1:08:02.960]  but still ongoing to this day. So, fast forward to the middle of Obama. The Chinese communists
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:06.840]  had so infiltrated things that even Goldman Sachs decided to just go with the Chinese
[1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:13.080]  model now. The CFR praised the Chinese century. The only agreement was China would not expand
[1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:19.000]  its military outside the South China Sea in its correct area and would control rare earth
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:25.200]  minerals and control world manufacturing, but they would divide the power by a NATO
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:31.840]  UN army controlling the diminished US as the world police force with a contribution of
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:38.600]  Chinese troops making up about half of the UN force but not commanded by Chinese troops,
[1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:47.240]  by Chinese generals. About nine years ago, halfway into Obama's term, it was clear the
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:51.840]  Chinese totally double-crossed the whole world government plan that was supposed to bring
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:55.320]  peace and all this, but it never was. These guys always double-crossed. Go back to World
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:59.000]  War II, World War I, it always happens. Hitler had stolen that a deal and then that of course
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:04.120]  broke up a few years into the war with Operation Barbarossa. Because Hitler and New Stalin
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:09.040]  was planning a sneak attack, but that's another report. And so now there's no honor amongst
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:13.800]  these thieves. The globalists have been exploiting China, using it to dominate the whole planet
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:21.880]  economically. China agreed in the 70s to a one-shot policy of eugenics to depopulate
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:26.280]  if they were given this dominance position. Starting again nine years ago, they say we're
[1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:29.800]  getting rid of the one-shot policy. They fully get rid of it five years ago. Then they start
[1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:33.680]  announcing we need to have more Chinese and totally dominate. If we all just have two
[1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:38.000]  kids, we'll dominate the world. The rest of the world is in declining population numbers.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.640]  The average Western country has 1.4 replacement for every two adults, which is a collapse
[1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:49.680]  level. China then officially last week announced three children and incentives to have three
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:56.560]  children. Russia also has incentives to even have one or two. So they're getting off the
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:00.960]  eugenics death cult. They're saying no to the carbon taxes. They're not going along
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.360]  with the New World Order. They want it for themselves and their own brand of New World
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:09.320]  Order. They don't allow gay advertising. They execute you in China. I'm not saying I agree
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:16.000]  with that, but the left loves China, remember, but they hate all the shows. So the Chinese
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.440]  are aware of this. They decided like the Russians did not commit suicide. And so they're getting
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:25.640]  off the plantation. They're still run by a dictator. It's still a terrible situation.
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:33.960]  And so Bill Gates and Fauci, because of Trump and the nationalism, and Bolsonaro and others
[1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:38.360]  came to them and said, listen, we know how to get them in line. We have Operation Lockstep,
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:44.920]  Event 201 is ready to launch it. Crimson Contagion. Here's the battle plan for a three year plan
[1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:48.360]  to bring in world government with China as the model, with our corporations at the head
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:52.080]  of it. We're ready to double cross everybody. We are in with you. And then later Gates said
[1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:56.280]  that in the news. I'm with China. Fauci said China's great. America's bad. You know, America
[1:10:56.280 --> 1:11:00.040]  should never reopen. I mean, they showed their China file. They made their move. They jumped
[1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:05.000]  too quick. Or maybe they're going to win. We're in the middle of it now. This is everything
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  you're hearing right now. This is it. This is it. This is the enchilada, the big one.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:12.920]  And so they already had a bunch of these viruses cooked up that they owned. They controlled
[1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:16.800]  it. They killed a bunch of old people and killed folks that didn't have high levels
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:23.400]  of vitamins and minerals. They would create a bunch of fear. And then they could control
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:27.000]  it because they ran the NIH. They ran the WHO. The Chinese were involved. They had this
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:33.280]  no man's land multinational lab with all this level four weapons development that was illegal
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.880]  in the U.S. and other areas going on. But so the Chinese wouldn't get nuked. They made
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:41.000]  a deal and they said, okay, you run it. Fauci runs it. Bill Gates runs it. We'll have the
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.400]  military there overseeing it, but it's your project. So you can't release it, double cross
[1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:51.560]  us and then go to war with us because they're not stupid. They can see the 3D chess. Meanwhile,
[1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:55.640]  Trump's canceling all this level four bio weapon stuff and having it moved out of the
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:12:01.160]  U.S. to his credit saying, no, no, no, you're making bio weapons. You're not finding cures.
[1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:05.960]  You're making new ones that find the cure to that. So in December of last year, they
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:11.040]  launched the attack. They released it in their own population. You say, why would you target
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:15.920]  your own population? Whoever the guy was that replaced Mao Zedong, I forget his name. He
[1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:18.760]  famously said, we're the only country in the world that would benefit from a nuclear war.
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:22.640]  Remember, they thought they had too many people for a while. They went to a one-shot policy.
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:27.120]  So they released it, used their own people to incubate it, do it while there's some
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:32.560]  U.S. troops in town. It's a plausible ability to blame them for military drill, start incubating
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:36.600]  it around the planet to create fear, then hype it up, then pay people to stay passing
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:41.480]  out and dying to create extra hysteria. Our media keeps us locked down. They never really
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:46.520]  locked down. They get double and triple the finances. All the jobs move back there. They
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:50.640]  win the trade war. The Democrats announced will never reopen the EU announces. They're
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:54.440]  never reopening. Canada announces they're never reopening. Australia announces they're
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:58.520]  never reopening. As I told you, they would. They let off for a while. They clamped right
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:03.000]  back down. But here we've had such a rebellion by the states and others. We're getting a
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:09.360]  partial reopening. And so when it comes out that Fauci cooked it up at the Chinese lab
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:14.880]  with Gates, China's saying, don't blame us or we'll have a nuclear war with you because
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:22.160]  blaming us is an act of war. And our response would be war with China if they did that.
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:26.200]  You understand? And so now because America is saying, we know you did it and we're getting
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:31.080]  ready to burn Fauci and burn Gates, and there are better patriots now moving in and understanding
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:35.160]  that that that it's either that or the end of America and total globalist domination
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:39.840]  and a new dark age and siege where we never reopened. We have a total societal collapse
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:45.640]  with Arab race wars in Europe and the UK and then black on white race war here as the cover
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:50.960]  screen for a total collapse and then a new Marshall plan with UN troops here taking all
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:54.800]  the guns. A lot of the globalists believe they can win the war. A lot of other smarter
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:58.760]  ones know they'll be on civil war. They'll probably lose with a lot of war games showing
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:05.360]  patriots, retake the United States and then launch a real war against them. So that's
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:08.880]  really what's going on right now. It's like a Mexican standoff and it couldn't be more
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:13.520]  dangerous. So when you see the Communist Chinese come out in their official publication
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:18.040]  and say, if you investigate the lab, we're going to nuke you. That's what they said today.
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:21.880]  China paid American media outlets, millions to publish propaganda. We're going to list
[1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:29.520]  those groups for you when we come back to the traders are. So think about that. That's
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:39.160]  where we are on June 2nd, 2021, less than halfway into this incredible year. So, wow.
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:43.000]  And then all the idiot leftists that signed on to China and America hating and losing
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:47.560]  their own jobs and being smucks. Just thank God you're not a useful idiot leftist blowing
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:52.200]  the dark pink haired moron idiot who's been sterilized. I mean, my God, these are idiot
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:57.920]  victims.
[1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:04.040]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:09.040]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:14.040]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:15:55.480 --> 1:16:00.840]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen,
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:04.720]  after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's
[1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:09.640]  one thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health can literally be
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:14.120]  the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:19.000]  do. So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:24.800]  substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support. Now, you'll
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:29.920]  have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:18.680]  they just learned by happenstance that quail that eat a certain diet produce eggs and eggshells
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:22.960]  that are amazing when people eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort or what
[1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:27.160]  folks call allergies. It's back in stock. It's been sold out for a long time. It's very

[1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:55.240]  customer because everybody else has gotten it basically has. This stuff really, really
[1:17:55.240 --> 1:18:00.480]  works. I've been on there 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of
[1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:04.800]  attacks, but also a lot of amazing support. And so that's why I always take time out
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:09.040]  to thank you for keeping us on there because without you, without the crew, without our
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:12.800]  sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on here and the
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:16.640]  world would be a different place. So it's not a power trip when I realized the great
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:23.600]  effect we've had. It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here,
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:28.080]  if you hadn't supported us, the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:32.400]  globalist. Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening. And so many
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:35.800]  of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:40.560]  open. And so info wars credibility is higher than it's ever been. But the enemy is trying
[1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:44.320]  to shut us down with so many different attacks. We've had to build our own infrastructure
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:48.800]  to stay on air. It's so expensive. So please get great products and keep info wars on the
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:53.200]  air at the same time at infowarstore.com. In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:19:19.200]  for one free shipping and double patriot points. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:48.400]  All right, let me go over these articles and I'll hit the incredible
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:56.200]  big seated elitism of Joe Biden. It's beyond racism. It's about control and playing groups
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:20:00.560]  off against each other. So they never come together. So that's coming up extremely powerful
[1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:06.960]  information. Believe me, you want to hear this next segment with the info we have in the
[1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:12.720]  video of Judge John Brown, who witnessed what I've read about in speeches and what has been
[1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:18.600]  admitted to even in mainline journals that Joe Biden would say about black people in public
[1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:24.200]  speeches. So wait, wait, wait till you hear this from an eyewitness. And then we have
[1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:29.440]  the documentation to prove it all next segment. All right, getting back to where we were.
[1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:33.120]  I just spent 10 minute segment kind of going over all the details from the beginning to
[1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:39.040]  the end as fast as I could. We tell you where we are currently. You have these China files,
[1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:46.040]  these globalist pro-China people like Fauci and Gates, because they're on the payroll.
[1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:49.800]  They've moved their main businesses there. Microsoft was the first computer company
[1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:54.440]  allowed in China by the party. They basically built their systems. I mean, look this up.
[1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:59.440]  This is on record. Apple's Tim Cook was over there three years ago and said we agree with
[1:20:59.440 --> 1:21:05.840]  censorship here and worldwide. Cook loves death camps. I mean, actually promotes the fact
[1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:10.960]  that they use slave labor. I mean, these are the worst of the worst. But again, he's gay
[1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:15.360]  and wears a black turtleneck sweater. So it's like, well, he can't be a death camp operator.
[1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:19.760]  I mean, he's gay. I mean, so, so, oh, they fund Black Lives Matter. They're good guys.
[1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:24.800]  It's all the cover for what they're doing. But here's the deal. You've got kind of the
[1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:29.360]  Hollywood devil worshipper pedophile type that just wants to destroy America and deface
[1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:33.960]  it because it's Christian. There's that group. Then you've got the mad scientist that want
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:38.320]  to play God and take over the world. And that's the Bill Gates group. It's also, you know,
[1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:41.560]  into kids and all the rest of it. It's all the same thing, but the different varieties.
[1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:45.600]  Then you've got the soulless evil chikoms that want total power and control. They're
[1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:51.080]  also into every form of degeneracy you can imagine. You've got them. You've got the Russian
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:56.040]  strong men in their own system. You've got the Anglo-American Empire that came out of
[1:21:56.040 --> 1:22:01.320]  the UK, the skeleton of the imperial world government, the Sun never set on the British
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:09.600]  Empire that formed the nexus or the matrix, the skeletal structure of this world government.
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:14.480]  But the world government just forms an AI global control grid that then these power
[1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:24.040]  factions battle over control of. And everything Gates does with the pink sweaters and the
[1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:27.800]  ice cream cones is, again, they're covered and looking on threatening. Oh, we're here
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:33.560]  with a deadly vaccine for you. We're here with a deadly vaccine for you. It's an ice
[1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:38.360]  cream truck. You see, oh, how does the pedophile get you in the car? Oh, I have a puppy. I
[1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:45.640]  have a puppy getting the car. So that's their whole program. But there's not just evil people
[1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:49.760]  in the world and it's coming out and scientists, oh, here's the key, are blowing the whistle
[1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:54.240]  and leaking the emails. As I told you a few weeks ago, that exposed at Fauci order gain
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:58.040]  of function because people are scared. They don't want to go to prison. And so that's
[1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:01.600]  why it's all over the news today that everything we told you a year and a half ago is true
[1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:05.440]  because we knew back then, but we knew how they controlled people. We know their methodology.
[1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:10.400]  So we don't just know the documentation. That's the skeleton again. We know the flesh
[1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:17.720]  and the skin of it because we know how they run these operations. They had the drill of
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:21.240]  the exact same thing happening the exact same time. So they got caught. They'd say it was
[1:23:21.240 --> 1:23:25.880]  a drill. They did it in a third party country so that it couldn't be blamed on any nation
[1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:31.520]  so the UN could oversee it because it's an active globalist war against humanity. You've
[1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:36.400]  got to have it be a country list thing or it'll start a real war. The war is against
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:41.720]  the people, not against the countries that are just a skeletal again organs of the world
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:49.520]  government. And so that's where we are right now. And it's either we never reopen like
[1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:55.560]  Canada and Australia and others or we get control and do reopen and fowl to them are
[1:23:55.560 --> 1:24:02.400]  punished within the Communist Chinese threatened war. Again, China state media says country
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:06.800]  must prepare for nuclear war with U.S. that for Biden asked for COVID probe. We must be
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:11.720]  prepared for an intense showdown between China and the U.S. They wrote the number of China
[1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:16.720]  nuclear warheads must reach the quality that makes U.S. elites. Remember, our media tells
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:22.000]  us there's no such thing as elites. It makes U.S. elite shiver should they entertain the
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:28.960]  idea of engaging in a military confrontation with China. Rapidly increase the number of
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:36.840]  commission nuclear warheads, DF, F-1Hs, intercontinental ballistic missiles and strategic missiles that
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:41.280]  have long-range capabilities that Bill Clinton gave them back in the mid-1990s. And it goes
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:48.560]  on. So, see, that's what's happening. Now, let's move on to the treason right here. Exposed.
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:55.000]  China paid American media outlets millions to publish propaganda. Kelly McBree and infowars.com.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.720]  It links to Justice Department documents. Time Magazine, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune,
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:06.040]  Farm Policy Magazine are all currently receiving money from the Chinese government. For example,
[1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:11.080]  $700,000 in advertising campaign paid by the China Daily by the government that just said
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:16.000]  NUCAS, I just read from them, published 75 online articles for the outlet in the last
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:22.720]  year. That's $700,000 for one outlet. It turns out they pay hundreds and hundreds of outlets,
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:30.080]  including CNN. And it's increased its spending in one publication now to over $1 million.
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:36.080]  That's just the tip of the iceberg. And the media groups won't even admit where they're
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:43.440]  getting the money. Now, let's move on to this. Wouldn't I say a few days ago when this broke?
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:47.440]  This is them letting us know we've got real bio weapons that kill a lot more than that
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:52.360]  COVID. COVID was a shot across the bow to lock us down, to train us, to make China dominant,
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:56.880]  to make sure we don't reopen. But then once you learn to stay locked down, then the global
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:00.000]  is uncomfortable. Hey, they're going to stay in their houses while we kill them, release
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:05.320]  the next weapon. The next one kills even more. You get locked down even longer than the next
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:09.120]  one. And then finally, you just get used to being killed one at a time until there's
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:14.840]  nobody left. That's why fish and stuff get in big, and sheep get in big groups, hoping
[1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:18.400]  that, oh, their safety, because they just, they don't get gotten that one time, somebody
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:23.160]  else gets drugged out. But statistically, they're just as likely to be eaten. China
[1:26:23.160 --> 1:26:29.560]  reports first human cases of H10N3 bird flu. Reuters, so they can scare us with that and
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:33.280]  whether it's real or not, use it to lock us down. There were a bunch of chicken littles
[1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:42.160]  that want to drink soy and become sterilized and watch Rachel Maddow. So that's the situation
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:45.560]  we're in. That's where we are right now. And it's really, really important that everybody
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:54.160]  be cognizant of those facts. I'm going to go to break and show the other side of the
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:58.840]  pencil attack. COVID locks us down, race war locks us down. We're going to cover that coming
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:06.680]  up next segment. First, infowarsphone.com, infowarsphone.com. You want to go to infowarsphone.com.

[1:27:55.200 --> 1:28:00.200]  a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with the
[1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:03.880]  globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:10.120]  you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure, so I get to

[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:21.320]  or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:26.200]  really, really awaiting the establishment. They don't want to go along with the globalist,
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:31.000]  but they're scared. They're looking for leadership. Well, that's where infowarsphone comes in.

[1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:59.120]  compounds God gave us. I always shoot you straight. And when I've told you over the years that
[1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:04.800]  if you don't support us, we'll be off the air. It's been true. But info wars has never been
[1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:10.320]  in a position where your support is more critical and more vital. The enemy behind the scenes
[1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:14.480]  is doing so many things. I'm not going to take time up to whine about it. It's okay. I expect
[1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:19.600]  to be attacked because we're over the target. We're having a great effect. We're exposing evil.
[1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:23.760]  You're exposing evil. So you spread the word about the broadcast or when you buy products or when
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:30.560]  you pray for info wars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful. So again,
[1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:36.640]  as Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate you as being
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:41.440]  veterans of the info war. And I particularly think our veterans as well to serve the armed forces
[1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:46.640]  because they understand what it is to sacrifice and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders
[1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:50.880]  in our republic to expose the globalist of a foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right
[1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:54.320]  now. So it's a very historical time to be alive. I want to thank you all for your support and ask
[1:30:54.320 --> 1:31:00.880]  you support us again. Endgame blueprint for global enslavement made 14 years ago accurately predicted
[1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:07.520]  the globalist takeover using the great reset and the threat of a virus. This film is now more
[1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:12.640]  important than ever. I noticed just a few months ago that suddenly the limited supply we had an
[1:31:12.640 --> 1:31:18.160]  info wars store.com had sold out and people were really talking about the documentary because
[1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:23.440]  major platforms like Amazon had banned it because the globalist openly criticized the film like
[1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:30.400]  the New York Times. And so we printed 20,000 copies now back in print and in less than two weeks,
[1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:36.000]  we've already sold half of them. This is very, very exciting. We're selling them close to cost
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:41.120]  and 3.95 a piece from you buy them in bulk or 14.95 you buy them individually. There is a zero
[1:31:41.120 --> 1:31:46.240]  country code on it meaning you can copy this anywhere in the world. Get it. Burn copies.
[1:31:46.240 --> 1:31:50.480]  Share it with everyone. It's blowing people away. It's evergreen. They predicted it all. Endgame
[1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:54.240]  blueprint for global enslavement available now at dvdandemboresstore.com
[1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:12.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:24.560]  You are listening to an info wars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:30.080]  All right. So multinational corporations have basically taken over the world.
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:34.240]  There's a few places they don't have full control of that's US, Russia, Brazil.
[1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:41.840]  And they are trying to be stabilized and collapse those countries so they get full control of the
[1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:45.200]  globalists don't have full control of Mexico's. They're doing the same thing there. They're pretty
[1:32:45.200 --> 1:32:49.120]  far along on that process. But the biggest way, and this is even in the WikiLeaks,
[1:32:49.920 --> 1:32:54.240]  Hillary Clinton talking to top psychology professors, the biggest way they want to
[1:32:54.240 --> 1:33:00.320]  take control of this domestically is racial division. They also divide the sexes. They divide
[1:33:00.320 --> 1:33:08.240]  the regions. They divide people on sexual proclivity or preference. And it's always divide, divide,
[1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:12.480]  divide and big tech puts people in their own little algorithms where they only feed you
[1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:20.800]  information that you basically agree with. That's the systems of control that they're pushing.
[1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:25.360]  And so if you see the hundreds of movies and TV shows about white people being bad and
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:31.840]  exaggerating massacres or making up massacres that happened 150 years ago or 100 years ago,
[1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:36.560]  that is because we're being taken over by a foreign multinational system that's enslaving us
[1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:41.360]  and it wants us, again, distracted from that process. And they admit that's the plan.
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:47.200]  And the Communist Chinese are funding it, but they were taught how to do that by the Hollywood
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:51.840]  groups who are experts at dividing. Read the New York Times, they have articles saying,
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:56.320]  do not have children of your white, whites are inherently bad people. And universities are saying,
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:02.960]  hey, you know, the gym's not open for white people. Classic discrimination. Biden saying, oh,
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:06.480]  we're only going to give aid to black people. That's just pandering. It's not for black people.
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:11.440]  It's about him having the power to decide who he gives stuff to. It's bad enough to give everybody
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:17.920]  something because it makes people lazy and it gives more power to the government. And it always
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:24.400]  turns into what it's becoming now, Venezuela. And so we're going at light speed towards Venezuela.
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:30.000]  We're going light speed towards why my republic collapsed the currency and the decision's been
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:35.040]  made, collapsed things so they can take over. We have to expose the globalists for doing this.
[1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:42.400]  But Biden came out yesterday with a full CNN push as well, showing income disparities between,
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:46.240]  you know, black and white net assets. Of course, they didn't tell you it's because most of the
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:50.320]  billionaires are rich white guys. They average that together to the average white family to make
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:56.320]  it look like, you know, the whites have all this money. And as if, because there's a white person
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:35:01.440]  might have more money than a black person, that's inherently bad when they don't even show you Asians
[1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:08.320]  in the pie that's even bigger. Or how about if CNN showed the average net income of a Jewish family,
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:13.600]  which is one of the highest in the world. And again, I'm not saying it's Jews. I'm saying
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:17.120]  nothing against white people or black people. We're going to show white people in a pie.
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:22.480]  Let's break it up to the billionaires. How 80% of that is the billionaires,
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:28.160]  because there are a bunch of white billionaires. And then let's divide it out, show the Asians,
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:32.640]  that'll be even bigger than that. And then let's show, because the government has all
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:38.240]  this from the census, let's show the Jewish income. Because if having more money than somebody says
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:43.360]  you're bad, well, that if we show how much the Jews have, that'll be in America, one of the biggest
[1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:47.600]  red circles. The average white family will now be a little bitty red circle. If you take the
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:52.800]  billionaires out, and the other rich groups, it'll be just poor like the black folks on average.
[1:35:53.840 --> 1:36:00.960]  See, the only white people have a disparage, a separate income. That's how this evil psychology
[1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:05.520]  works. Well, I'm going to play this clip of Biden talking about this, and then I've got the incredible
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:12.800]  video that we've posted to the Live Feed article on Info Wars. Wow, Judge Joe Brown unloads on
[1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:17.840]  racist Joe Biden and corrupt witch Kamala in an incredible hour-long interview. We're going to
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:24.000]  play a bunch of it coming up next segment. But here first is Joe Biden. The homeland today,
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:33.520]  not ISIS, not al-Qaeda, white supremacists. That's not me. That's the intelligence community
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:41.520]  under both Trump and under my administration. Two weeks ago, I signed the law, the COVID-19
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:46.240]  Hate Crimes Act, which the House had passed in the Senate. My administration will soon lay out
[1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:51.120]  our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:59.120]  crimes and other forms of bigotry. But I'm going to close where I started. To Mother Randall, Mother
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:05.600]  Fletcher, Mr. Van Ellis. Wow. By the way, if you're ready, you're listening. You're lucky. You don't
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:12.880]  look at him. Guys, zoom in on his face. I watched him yesterday while he was live because, again,
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:16.800]  I've got TVs all over the office in the hallway so we can keep track of the enemy transmissions.
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:21.360]  And I watched him on a big HDTV while I was getting a cup of coffee. And he looks like he's
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:24.960]  degenerating fast. Because when you've got dementia and they get you hopped up on drugs,
[1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:31.040]  be able to still talk, I mean, he just had his eyes closed. He is just really degenerating. Go
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:36.000]  ahead and roll it without audio. Go ahead and roll it so we just look at it. I mean, look at that face.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:43.360]  He is falling apart fast and he's got blackheads just all over his face. His nose looks like it's
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:49.360]  rotting off. He looks like one of those roaches he's talking about. So what's really going on here?
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:57.600]  This is a desperate communist Chinese agent with Hollywood that hates America being ordered,
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:03.520]  create division. So he's going to Oklahoma where there was a big race war to hype it up.
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:07.440]  And he's got all these shows and these movies and these TV shows. There's all these fake hate
[1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:15.840]  crimes where they're busting, not just Jesse Smallyer as one comment called him, Jesse Smallett,
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:20.640]  and not just Bubba Wallace, but all these other people that are being told to do this by the
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:26.960]  corporate media to, again, create division. And the idea that the number one threat in America
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:32.080]  isn't communist China, isn't all the cancer exploding, isn't all the autism, isn't all the
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:38.480]  deadly vaccines, isn't being shut down, isn't all the suicide, isn't all the fentanyl,
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:45.120]  no, it's white people. The number one threat is white people, says an old weird crazy dude that
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:52.160]  got laws passed to give white people less long jail sentences than black people. And who actually
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:56.960]  said he was a Dixie Cratt, who actually said, you know, that you got to keep blacks in jail,
[1:38:56.960 --> 1:39:02.320]  they're super predators. I mean, who hung out with Robert Byrd, he's everything the system
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:09.200]  loves and everything that black people claim they hate, but he's supposedly their president,
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:13.440]  but they didn't vote for Biden. Triple the number of black men, double the number of black women,
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:18.640]  voted for Trump, and they had their vote and their election stolen. And so did I.
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:28.560]  And then you've got the black on white crime being 10 times higher than white on black.
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:32.240]  And that's the FBI's numbers. But you just heard him say, we have the numbers
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:37.840]  from the intelligence agencies. You mean the FBI? They gave $100,000 to you for business deals?
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:44.240]  The FBI director free? You mean the FBI that lets you sell us out to China? You mean the
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:49.760]  attorney general in confirmation testimony, Garland, who was asked about you sold out to foreign
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:55.120]  countries? And he said, it's impossible that you as president would violate your oath. Yeah, right.
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:00.160]  He's the one to sell the country out. He's the one bringing in the smuggled kids.
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:03.760]  He's the one letting the fentanyl in. He's the one shut down the Keystone pipeline.
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:08.000]  He's the one shut down, no doubt, the other pipelines. They have the motive. They have the
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.600]  history. He's the one there as the agent to destroy this nation. And it's so embarrassing
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:17.440]  to the Chinese that they'd able to dominate us like this. They won't even talk to him
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:20.720]  on the secretary of defense. They're just like, we know you're being spot on.
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:25.520]  We know your government that what's left knows you're a Chinese agent. They won't even talk to
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:30.480]  Biden because they know war is coming. I mean, this is a mess. And then millions of
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:35.040]  illegals show up in Biden shirts because he said immediately serves the border.
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:43.040]  What a time to be alive. Put the FBI statistics back up there, folks. There's less than 20
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:47.200]  black men killed a year by the police. There are questionable circumstances,
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:51.520]  less than 100 total. And I'm not saying that's a good thing. I care about everybody.
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:54.720]  I wish George Floyd would have become a drug addict and wouldn't have been out there. I wish
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:58.320]  that none of this would have happened. My God, all of us have struggled with something in our
[1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:01.920]  lives. I've never with drugs, but I've done it with alcohol. I don't judge George Floyd.
[1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:06.320]  He looks like he's in hell when he's in the back of that police car, having a panic attack
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:11.840]  on meth and fentanyl. That's way worse than heroin. But the point is the globalists don't
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:16.800]  care about him. They don't care about you. They don't care about me. They want power and control.
[1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:21.680]  And Judge Brown knocks it out of the park. So I'm going to play a lot of it when we start
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:26.000]  the next segment. Hey, all of us are being hit with gender-bending chemicals,
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:30.320]  endocrine disruptors in the water by design and in the food. Stop eating soy products.
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:34.560]  Stop eating stuff with plastic linings. But, ladies and gentlemen, we have the new three

[1:44:57.760 --> 1:45:02.800]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been Alex Jones was right,
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:09.280]  but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, making the
[1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:14.480]  globalists pull their hair out in anger. But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today. And thanks
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:19.280]  to your support, we're still on air at infowarst.com and Bandai video radio stations and TV stations
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:23.840]  across the country. And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:29.280]  one a few years ago, is now available again. We have reprinted it with high quality DVD in HD.
[1:45:29.280 --> 1:45:33.680]  It has a zero country code. Any one in the world is authorized to make copies of it. And I'm asking
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:37.920]  you to get the original, make copies, give it to everyone you know, air local access TV, give it
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.760]  to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do,
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:47.200]  warn the world. This film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:52.480]  It's more important than ever available at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com Endgame,
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:46:08.400]  blueprint for global enslavement. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:46:22.800 --> 1:46:30.800]  The United States is under globalist attack. The largest meat packer in the United States has
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:37.920]  been shut down for days, unable to run its facilities. We saw the colonial pipeline shut
[1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:43.760]  down for close to a week, exploding gas prices. We see Biden announcing that states can shut down
[1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:49.840]  pipelines, even if the feds can't via treaty with Canada. Canada doesn't want the pipeline shut down,
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:56.160]  but Biden's giving the dictator governor the power to do that, totally unconstitutional.
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:04.000]  And now this is breaking. Mass steamship authority in Massachusetts hit by ransomware attack,
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:08.640]  ferries delayed. Why are we all going on these digital systems when they mess things up?
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:13.600]  Why are we getting humans out of the process? Why are we going all the AI and all centralized
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:19.120]  systems when it cripples us? I mean, this isn't just an episode of Battlestar Galactica where you
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:24.480]  learn you shouldn't do that. This is the real world. But no, that's not the number one threat,
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:28.480]  is ransomware or communist China threatening nuclear war. The number one threat you heard
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:34.080]  him in a speech yesterday is the epidemic of white supremacy, killing black people.
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:38.160]  And he's got to go back 100 years to find a big example of it. Wow.
[1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:43.200]  Didn't want to go to Chicago, though. 4,000 blacks shooting roughly 4,000 blacks. No.
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.520]  Meanwhile, what is Joe Biden really up to? Because you talk about Hootspot.
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:56.320]  You talk about Bravada. You talk about arrogance. You talk about turning the whole thing around
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:48:01.600]  in gaslighting. There's a very powerful interview at infowars.com that I suggest you share with
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:06.000]  everybody you know. You're going to share one thing. It's this. And I've got it reposted in
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:11.440]  the live show feed under the live show feed. A link to this right now at infowars.com. Wow.
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:18.080]  Now, Judge Joe Brown unloads on racist Joe Biden and corrupt witch Kamala. And again,
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:22.080]  everything he says, I've reverse engineered. I found quotes from their witnesses. Everything
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:30.240]  he says is true. Listen carefully, because this guy is telling you 100% truth about Kamala,
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:36.880]  about Joe Biden, about it all. Here he is talking about what the left thought was the last Dixie
[1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:42.080]  Cret, the last real KKK racist. I know folks that do Biden up in Maine, where it is, he's
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:47.200]  actually in the KKK. So here it is, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I don't particularly like Trump,
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:53.280]  but I'm not against him. I did not vote for that damn fool that they had running against him.
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:49:00.320]  That racist dog, when I heard the first time in 1972, when I was doing an intern thing at the
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:09.840]  D.C. think tank, when he was out there with James O. Eastland, John B. Stennis, Paul Bus came in from
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:17.760]  Arkansas. That's the fool said they'd never integrate the Little Rock High School. They had
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:25.280]  Wallace there, who was wheeled in and they had Bird, former brand dragon of the Klan. And they
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:29.920]  were talking about this young man who had a stupid looking duck tail, like he was back in
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:39.520]  the 1950s, was the last true yellow dog Dixie Cret. And they were talking about Joe Biden,
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:44.960]  who got up there and when the speech he gave, I mean, I was really offended. I heard it right
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:52.560]  outside the state Capitol building in Dover, which was a rundown ransack old house, 250 years old.
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:59.840]  And he said, Negro children are like roaches, if they're allowed to integrate the schools they
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:06.640]  will infest them and they will never be gotten out. Negro Joe Biden said that. Yeah, I heard it.
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:18.480]  He said Negroes were animals and they turned the streets into jungles. And he and Senator Eastland
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:26.080]  had a plan where they could put all of these Negro animals in zoos. Now we talk about the 94
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:34.560]  crime bill, that wasn't shit. The 91 was bad. The 97 was really bad. The 81 was the one where
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:40.560]  one rock got you five years, which due to some other stuff, Biden and
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:47.920]  Venice and Eastland did. It wasn't five years with parole, they abolished federal parole.
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:53.920]  So you get five years, you get 60 months and you get released with all good and honor time
[1:50:53.920 --> 1:51:01.840]  at 56 months from federal custody. And then there was that was the 81 when then there was
[1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:09.760]  a 79 and the 77. So let's give blame where blame is due. That bastard has been a racist dog. And he
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:16.720]  used to talk about he understood the Negro because he was raised in Delaware. And he said Delaware
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:26.320]  was a proud slave owning state that basically copped out by not going with the South during
[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:32.160]  the rebellion as it should have because they were too close to DC to not be intimidated.
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:38.560]  So I listen to this racist dog. I kept up with him because I was practicing criminal law
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:46.400]  law and federal criminal trials became almost a lynch thing because of what is allowed. By the
[1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:51.440]  way, if you ever get interrogated by the feds, never say I don't know what happened. I don't
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:57.520]  know anything about it because you will get convicted on one count of an indictment saying
[1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:03.120]  making an annoyingly false statement to a federal investigator. You know why? Because they tell you
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:08.000]  what you're there for. So you know what you're there for. So when you say I don't know nothing
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:15.200]  about it, you did because they told you. With the feds, you say I have nothing to say or I refuse
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:20.240]  to make a statement. I want a lawyer, but you talk with the states. I don't know what you're
[1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:29.520]  talking about. You know, but with the feds, watch what you say because in a federal system,
[1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:36.880]  thanks to Biden, Spanish, Eastland and some other these yellow dog Dixie Cratt races,
[1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:46.160]  what happens is they set it up so you get tried by ambush if it is a criminal case. And if you
[1:52:46.160 --> 1:52:53.360]  are absolutely innocent, you don't know about what happened. Eastland and Spanish and Biden set
[1:52:53.360 --> 1:53:02.320]  something else up where they deliberately set the rules so that a prosecutor could knowingly
[1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:09.600]  go at well, not knowing, but know that he had no case that could get an convict conviction,
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:15.360]  but deliberately go after you for the purpose of bankrupting you so your ability to operate
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:21.760]  is destroyed. Now that's one of the bad things that bastard did. And then you got come Queen
[1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:32.640]  La Imhoff in there. You know him off in? No. Yes, you do. Who? Mrs. Imhoff, vice president of the
[1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:37.440]  United States who goes by her maiden name. Miss Kamala, Camilla Harris.
[1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:49.360]  She's got two Jewish children she adopted. It's married a Jewish husband who's got a
[1:53:49.360 --> 1:53:55.600]  it. I'm serious about Kamala Harris. I don't let you have that one. She's a witch and she is a
[1:53:55.600 --> 1:54:00.720]  corrupt witch. She's been corrupt her whole life and she's a way to the top.
[1:54:02.880 --> 1:54:09.920]  They used to detail this witch in LA Times with her sexual escapades. She's damn near everybody
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:15.200]  trying to get up. She used to be a proud old when she was at home and she ain't black.
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:21.200]  You know what you got to do with this, Miss Harris? No, I mean, well don't, but she's a
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:26.720]  I'm just, I don't know. I'm just listening. Well, here's the thing. I actually met her father
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:34.160]  in Jamaica. I was the guest, said at the governor general's table and he was a professor.
[1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:39.280]  Okay. He represents as a Hindu Brahmin.
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:49.760]  He admittedly has some Irish in him. All right. The person that Kamala Harris is saying is her
[1:54:49.760 --> 1:54:56.960]  black great grandmother is in fact, according to daddy in an article he wrote, which has now
[1:54:56.960 --> 1:55:06.000]  been cleaned up on the online edition of that magazine was a Hindu house servant, not a black
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:12.320]  woman. So her mother is listed on her birth certificate is Caucasian, even though she's dark,
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:18.560]  but see, she's a Hindu Brahmin to meal cast. Now.
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:23.360]  All right. Listen, I don't have time to get to all of it because we got the odds to
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:27.920]  ones coming on, but they get even better. And he gets into how she's basically think she's an
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:32.400]  Aryan, which rules over black people. And that's that comes out of India. And that's why
[1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:38.400]  Indians don't think that, but she thinks that and that she was brought up basically thinking
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:42.800]  you're supposed to rule over people like in Jamaica. She's not none of her. She's not African at all.
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:47.600]  It's all another big giant hoax. And it's just par for the course, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:52.800]  of the total fraud. And then he gets into how she was a sex operative and how she had sex
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:59.440]  there by to get to where she was. Not just Willie Brown and those even articles in the LA Times
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:04.720]  about all the weird stuff she did. So, you know, there she is. Nothing wrong with her being Indian.
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:10.400]  Her mom looks like Bugs Bunny. That's kind of cool. But we're going to come back and cover all
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:16.640]  that next hour, ladies and gentlemen, but this is just the total fraud that is Kamala Harris.
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:23.360]  I mean, this woman is fake as it gets, ladies and gentlemen. Okay, that's it for this hour.
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:26.800]  Wow, China threatened to war with us and more hope we're still here next week.

[1:58:52.240 --> 1:59:17.600]  Well, I won't back down. No, I won't back down. You can stand me up at the gates of hell. But I won't
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:29.280]  back down. Gonna stand my ground will be turned around be turned around. And I'll keep this world
[1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:41.760]  and I'll keep this world from dragging me down. Gonna stand my ground. And I won't back down. Hey,
[1:59:41.760 --> 1:59:58.560]  baby, there ain't no easy way out. There ain't no easy way out. Hey, I will stand my ground. And I
[1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:06.640]  won't. Neither of you. Fauci and Bill Gates are being destroyed as we speak. I told you months ago
[2:00:06.640 --> 2:00:12.560]  they will be politically annihilated bare minimum. And I just go with my gut in the analysis. I think
[2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:18.400]  they're going to go to prison. And I think if we work hard, we expose them and we're diligent,
[2:00:18.400 --> 2:00:22.320]  we pray, I believe they'll be convicted. And that someday I believe we'll watch them both
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:27.280]  hung in public. I really do. They launched this attack with Communist China. You know,
[2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:30.960]  you think that's strong rhetoric? It's not. Communist China just threatened to nuke us if we
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:36.720]  keep investigating the Wuhan lab. They did this on purpose with the UN. China controls the WHO and
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:42.400]  the UN to a great extent and they're making their move on us. And a lot of Western elites have signed
[2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:47.680]  on to this bio attack that's killed millions and then killed millions for starvation. And you have
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:53.120]  to say it. I don't want any harm against Bill Gates or Fauci. That could turn them into heroes.
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:01:00.320]  That could turn them into martyrs. No vigilante violence. I want them arrested. I want their
[2:01:00.320 --> 2:01:07.040]  records brought out. I want public trial. And then I want a jury to find them guilty because the
[2:01:07.040 --> 2:01:15.680]  evidence is overwhelming. And I will take life in prison. They are incredible villains. And so I
[2:01:15.680 --> 2:01:21.440]  don't think execution would turn them into victims, but maybe let them spend the rest of their
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:32.320]  miserable lives on public display. Like you put animals in a cage. They want to put us in a cage.
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:37.360]  They want us to live in a cage. How about we throw Joe Biden in there with them?
[2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:46.640]  Israel finds possible link between Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and heart inflammation. Really
[2:01:46.640 --> 2:01:52.400]  Fauci funded study at UT on it in animals with the same type of vaccines and did the same thing.
[2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:59.120]  It killed them. Doesn't kill them right away. Usually takes a few months. And mice a few months
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:09.200]  is like a few years for a human. So what's in the SPARS 2325 war game that we find out it causes
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:13.840]  brain inflammation, heart attacks, all these problems in a drill they were holding
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:24.480]  three, four years ago. An exact drill, the exact plan. 2023 is 2020 to 2023.
[2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:30.160]  What did General Flynn say he used to run major war games? He knows that governments don't call
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:35.840]  plans attack plans. They call them war game scenarios, but the war game codes are real.
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:40.560]  The orders are real. When you need it, you pull the war game off the shelf and then you execute
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:48.560]  the war game. Then you make changes during the war game if need be. Go watch the video,
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:53.440]  General Flynn said every American should see emergency Saturday blood gas world shot by SPARS
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:03:00.400]  2025, 2028. I was having a brain fog there. I guess not for vaccines, but it's not 2023,
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:07.920]  2025, 2025, 2028. But the real years are current time. So excuse my faux pas.
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:12.240]  We're going to break. I believe we're getting the Hodge Twins on. We want to get them on for
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:15.680]  weeks. They've been so busy. They've been hotter than a firecracker, hotter than a pistol.
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:19.840]  So has a guy they coaxed a lot with. Stephen Crowder is getting massively censored.
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:28.640]  Very dangerous days right now. But if we're getting censored, it means you're doing your job
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:32.160]  and that's why more and more they're getting censored. So we're going to cover the waterfront
[2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:39.040]  with the Hodge Twins. Talk about the Tulsa massacre. Talk about George Floyd. Talk about
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:46.080]  Joe Biden, the Chinese agent and all the incredible news in 60 seconds. When we come back, stay
[2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:56.000]  with us and tell everybody you know, tune in. I've got some really good news for the viewers
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:02.240]  and listeners this broadcast. And then I've got some really, really, really, really, really good news.
[2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:05.440]  Yes, I can spend an hour telling you about how the Globals are getting exposed and how they
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:10.240]  launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in. I can even
[2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:14.080]  tell you about how the states are turning against the public president Biden and saying we're going
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:18.320]  to have $1,000 fines to try to make people wear masks. I can tell you about all of that,
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:23.440]  but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the info war?
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:27.680]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day special
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:35.600]  for the next week only with store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points and DNA Force Plus
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:41.360]  is back in stock, sold out for seven months, 40% off. Supermobile mentality, 50% off.
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:45.040]  Cross to guard, 40% off. Out of the power, 50% over 12,
[2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:51.440]  50% as OB, 50% free shipping and Patriot Points and Fauci and Four and its incredible products
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:05:05.200]  and George Soros hates it. It's due second on this Wednesday edition. We've got the HODS claims,
[2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:13.360]  some of the most popular conservative Patriots in the world. If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:22.240]  you are the resistance. Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. You know, I've been a
[2:05:22.240 --> 2:05:28.720]  fan of Judge Joe Brown, thanks for watching on TV. And I know he was on another big, huge interview
[2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:34.080]  with another man named Brown, famous NBA star Kwame Brown, bust life. And it's an hour long
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:37.840]  interview. I watched the whole thing last night. It's over an hour. And he just blew me away.
[2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:41.200]  How everything he says is true is reminding me all this stuff I learned over the years
[2:05:41.200 --> 2:05:47.920]  about Biden and Hillary and all of them like saying the things blacks are super predators,
[2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:53.120]  they're bad, all the things they say Trump did. And now they're doing it. And now Biden's saying
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:57.840]  white supremacists killing blacks is the biggest threat. I thought it was all this malware hijacking
[2:05:57.840 --> 2:06:02.880]  everything and shutting down the meatpacking and the power supplies and the pipelines. I thought
[2:06:02.880 --> 2:06:07.040]  it was China threatening to nuke us in their national newspaper today. If we investigate
[2:06:07.040 --> 2:06:11.920]  who on we'll talk to the hodge twins about this and a bunch of other subjects in a moment. But
[2:06:11.920 --> 2:06:17.600]  I got to play a little bit of the clip again. Here is Judge Brown who witnessed this when he was
[2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:25.600]  an intern in DC with his own eyes when the Dixie Crats brought their new savior who he was back
[2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:32.640]  then. And this is the guy that tried to stop in the 70s and 80s integration. I mean, when nobody
[2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:39.760]  was doing that. So here it is. Bird, former brand dragon of the clan. And they were talking about
[2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:46.480]  this young man who had a stupid looking duck tail like he was back in the 1950s was the last true
[2:06:46.480 --> 2:06:54.640]  yellow dog Dixie Crats. And they were talking about Joe Biden who got up there and when the
[2:06:54.640 --> 2:07:00.480]  speech he gave, I mean, I was really offended. I heard it right outside the state Capitol building
[2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:09.440]  in Dover, which was a rundown ransack old house 250 years old. And he said Negro children are
[2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:15.360]  like roaches if they're allowed to integrate the schools, they will infest them and they will never
[2:07:15.360 --> 2:07:27.280]  be gotten out. Negro Joe Biden said that. Yeah, I heard it. He said Negroes were animals and they
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:35.040]  turned the streets into jungles and he and Senator Eastland had a plan where they could put all of
[2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:42.320]  these Negro animals in zoos. Now we talk about the 94 crime bill. That wasn't shit. The 91 was
[2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:50.960]  bad. The 97 was really bad. The 81 was the one where one rock got you five years, which
[2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:59.520]  was due to some other stuff. Biden and Spanish and Eastland did. It wasn't five years with parole.
[2:07:59.520 --> 2:08:03.600]  They about it. So, so, so there you go. And I conflated something because I watched the whole
[2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:07.040]  interview last night when I was tired somewhere in there. He doesn't be an intern in the think tank
[2:08:07.040 --> 2:08:11.280]  and now he heard something else racist that Joe Biden said face to face. But I guess that was in
[2:08:11.280 --> 2:08:15.840]  Maine. He actually saw that also doing the same job. So, so gentlemen, I know you try to create
[2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:20.800]  unity. So do I. So we normally just talk about other big subjects, you know, promoting America and
[2:08:20.800 --> 2:08:25.680]  all our shared freedoms. But the Hodges twins are here with us on YouTube, conservative twins,
[2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:29.840]  Instagram official Hodges twins on Twitter, Hodges twins. You guys are awesome. You don't
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:34.880]  need any introduction, but so much is going on. But man, to have a guy that has this history
[2:08:34.880 --> 2:08:39.280]  running around now trying to create division, trying to go open old wounds in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:46.000]  doing all of this. I mean, give us both your take on where this is going and what you think so far
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:51.520]  of the so called presidency of this guy. Well, I think Joe Biden has been a Shannon, you know,
[2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:55.840]  just hold time. I don't actually think he won the election. But I want to touch on what Joe
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:01.920]  Joe Brown was talking about. Here's a man who has I witnessed testimony of what
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:08.320]  was a real Joe Biden is. I mean, he was actually there. He heard this man say these things.
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:12.800]  When Trump is in office, they have all these people accusing this man of rape and dissonant
[2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:18.480]  happened 30, 20 years ago. There's no way you can verify that you can't can't actually believe
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:21.600]  these women because some of the stories that they're bringing up, it doesn't make a lot of
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:26.480]  sense. Like some woman came out and said Trump actually raped her in a dressing room. But here
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:31.440]  we have a man who's a judge who is an eyewitness who actually heard these things and nobody wants
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:35.840]  to listen to him. Nobody wants to share those things. It just doesn't make a lot. I mean,
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:41.520]  it's just it's just very sad to me. We have Joe Biden. I mean, the left is always preaching
[2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:46.560]  against systemic racism. That systemic racism, they're looking right at him. He's he's a
[2:09:46.560 --> 2:09:50.560]  representation of what this country was going through in the sixties and seventies. Yeah.
[2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:56.640]  Yeah, I think like him just going to Tulsa and commemorating what happened. I mean,
[2:09:56.640 --> 2:10:02.080]  which was an awful thing that happened. Right. But he's not commemorating for that.
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:06.480]  He's just trying to show black people I'm here for you. Come vote for me, even though I haven't
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:11.120]  done anything for anybody but my family and my whole time I've been a politician. Yeah, it's
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:16.960]  just that he race bait. He panders. And for some reason, even though this has been going on for
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:22.160]  decades, black people continue to fall for it. Black people are so upset about Christopher
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:27.360]  Columbus. You don't want to celebrate that. But why y'all want to celebrate something that happened
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:31.680]  over 100 years ago? The only reason why they want to celebrate these things is because they're
[2:10:31.680 --> 2:10:36.720]  asking for something. And they think Joe Biden and the Democrats and people on the left is actually
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:40.800]  going to give them reparations or restitution. They're not going to see any of that. They have
[2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:46.480]  not till this day, black folks, black livers have woken up and realized what these people are doing
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:51.120]  to them. They're using them mentally, enslaving them for vote. That's the only reason why Joe
[2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:55.120]  Biden's there. Yeah, they're actually asking for reparations for what happened in Tulsa. There's
[2:10:55.120 --> 2:11:00.320]  only like two survivors left from that. Yeah. And I say, fine, give them, I mean, sure, the state
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:04.160]  or somebody should try to help them out. But the point is, is that you're right. He's there to open
[2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:09.200]  old wounds and distract from what he's doing to all America, shutting down the pipelines,
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:14.160]  leaving the border wide open, smuggling people in, being on the Chinese payroll while they threaten
[2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:19.040]  to nuke us. I mean, this is so obvious. Meanwhile, it's not just what Judge Brown said. He's a very
[2:11:19.040 --> 2:11:24.000]  credible person. As you said, Biden's famous Hillary, I have video Hillary saying blacks are
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:29.440]  super predators, you got to keep them to heal like a dog. I mean, and I've got the campaign
[2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:35.200]  material from when they ran for governor, classic Dixie Cratt racist crap, which I'm not even hyping
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:39.760]  that up said, Oh, gosh, let's all cry about it. The point is, that's who they are. And then they're
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:44.480]  trying to say America is evil. Republicans are evil. And white people are the number one threat
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:52.640]  in America. I mean, what the it's so transparent. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's a blind man can see it.
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:56.960]  Yeah, it's white white people is not the most dangerous thing in this country. That's why that
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:12:02.000]  BLM found that when she got some money from, you know, taking all these donations out here,
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:07.520]  buying houses around white people, white people is not a huge threat to anybody in this country.
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:10.960]  Yeah. Well, there's a crazy bad white people. But the point is, statistically, it's not because
[2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:14.480]  they're white, because they're bad. There's bad people every color, like like Hillary Clinton.
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:17.920]  In fact, put that video back on screen. In this video, we'll play it when we come back in a few
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:24.080]  minutes. She she says what I just said. I mean, this woman is incredible. Imagine if Trump had
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:29.760]  ever said black people are super predators, you got to pull them to heal like a dog. Right.
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:32.960]  Like, you know, it's crazy, Alex. That's the first time I've ever heard that.
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:38.880]  I would see it myself. I mean, I think I do my homework, but I missed that.
[2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:42.240]  Oh, hey, a lot of folks don't even know that Biden, and I know you guys know this is a
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:47.680]  watch a show, but that Biden said if I win, surge the border, because now they're trying
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:51.600]  to say, Hey, it's not our fault this happened. But he said serves the border. That's why they
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:58.560]  were wearing Joe Biden shirts. And now CNN Kamala Harris team dismayed by being held responsible
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:03.920]  for border crisis. And they keep pointing the finger at Trump like it's, it's his fault.
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:09.520]  He had it. When Trump took over this country and the border situation was out of hand.
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:12.960]  He was able to rectify it in very little time. He's building a wall. He started putting
[2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:17.200]  in procedures. He started actually enforcing our immigration laws. So this he's out of office.
[2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:22.560]  Biden's doing away with all that. And now I had his policies. He wants to blame them on Trump.
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:29.120]  Yeah, it's amazing. When we come back, I'll try to pull that clip it and play it. But I also want
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:33.760]  to ask you guys this. What we're just real fast. What do you think ends up happening to Biden?
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:38.800]  Because he's obviously degenerating so fast. Right. I mean, it's just like a weekend at
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:43.280]  Bernie's movie. I mean, they're propping them up, holding them up. I mean, he's not really the,
[2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:47.840]  he's just a face to the presidency. He's got a bunch of people that's playing him like a puppet.
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:54.080]  I don't think he's going to make the four years, Alex. I mean, I hope he doesn't make,
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:57.120]  but I just hope we get him out in four years. That's what I'm hoping. Right.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  Well, how does he make it? Well, I mean, he's already a laughing stock. What happens?
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:10.080]  Right. He said the N word in the F word with the first 90 days of his presidency. So I mean,
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:17.120]  but the thing is, no matter what he does or say, it's just the thing about mainstream media,
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:22.080]  they're not holding people accountable. I mean, they, they dig in hard on conservatives. They
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:28.880]  need to dig in and, and go in hard on the, on liberal. They need to hold both sides accountable.
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:34.720]  But whatever he does or says, they spin it to make it look like he's a victim. It plays real,
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:40.400]  it plays in that favor really, because liberalism is nothing but victimization of people based on
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:46.320]  your skin color, your sexual orientation, how much money you make. I mean, it's just, that's it.
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:49.200]  Let's, let's come back and talk about that. And I'll get that clip pulled into the super
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:55.520]  predator clip by Hillary. Stay with us in 60 seconds. I don't have time to tell you how amazing

[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:54.240]  everybody else has gotten it basically has this stuff really, really works. I'm not going to say
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:58.800]  this five times in a row to be a notch. I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:07.760]  criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass
[2:16:07.760 --> 2:16:13.360]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so called COVID-19
[2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:21.440]  Franken shot. I must say the second time around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refuse to
[2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:28.160]  take the Franken shots. They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned
[2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:32.400]  in most countries around the world. This is an attack on the American people, the people of the
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:38.160]  world. This is an absolute red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times.
[2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:44.240]  Around half the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refuse to take the
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:49.440]  vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so called vaccine and
[2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:52.320]  you shouldn't either. You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[2:16:52.320 --> 2:17:02.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:20.080]  Since we mentioned it, why not play the video clip? We've got the Hodges twins here.
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:26.160]  Here is Biden saying, if I have a disagreement with Kamala, I'll just feign an illness and resign.
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:33.360]  Wow. He's so seen all. He's being honest. Here it is. If I reach something where there's a
[2:17:33.360 --> 2:17:41.040]  fundamental disagreement we have based on a moral principle, I'll develop some disease and say I
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:49.280]  have to resign. We don't have that. We haven't and we discussed it when our views on foreign policy
[2:17:49.280 --> 2:17:58.640]  and domestic policy on intelligence and the great thing is. So there we go. The Hodges twins are
[2:17:58.640 --> 2:18:02.960]  with us. Tell you about their official website here in just a moment because it's just as important
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:06.880]  as their big YouTube and Twitter and Facebook pages because those could be taken away.
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:11.200]  I hope not. But look what's happening to Stephen Crowder right now. But since they didn't know
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:15.600]  about it, most people don't know about this. In fact, the snopes says this doesn't exist. So
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:21.760]  that's when you know something exists. So it says it doesn't exist. Here she is in 1996 giving a
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:28.000]  speech to a women's group. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:33.840]  cartels. They are not just games of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called
[2:18:33.840 --> 2:18:39.360]  super predators, no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way. But
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:44.240]  first we have to bring them to heel and the president has asked the FBI to launch a very
[2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:50.240]  concerted effort against gangs everywhere. In addition to that, he has appointed a new drug czar.
[2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:56.160]  You probably saw him Tuesday night. He's one of the most distinguished active military generals
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:19:01.040]  that we have in our country. He's already proven that he knows how to interdict drugs because
[2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:06.960]  of his command of the South American activity on behalf of the United States. But General
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:10.000]  McCaffrey will make a big difference. I'm going to play the whole speech. We're specifically
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:15.120]  talking about the crime bill that disproportionate targeted black Americans with longer sentences
[2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:18.720]  and then you have similar statements about that. But there you have it. We've got the
[2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:22.800]  Hodge Twins here with us. What's the best website for people to visit for you guys and
[2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:28.960]  find all those great t-shirts and the rest of it? It's officialHodgeTwins.com is our website.
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:32.720]  And Hodge Twins Tour is our site for because we're doing comedy shows later this year. We're
[2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:37.120]  going to Texas. We're going to San Antonio and Dallas. I'm going to come see you when you're
[2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:41.040]  in San Antonio. That's close to my neck of the woods. You guys will be popular here in Austin
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:45.760]  too just because it's been invaded by California. There's still some hope. We've been banned from
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:50.160]  Austin. Yeah. We can't book a show in Austin. Yeah. We used to tour there but they banned all
[2:19:50.160 --> 2:19:54.800]  our shows because we're conservative. We can't book. We can't even do a show on the street.
[2:19:55.440 --> 2:19:58.480]  Okay. Let's tackle this now because this is a shorter segment. I want to hit all the other
[2:19:58.480 --> 2:20:03.200]  big issues next segment. But this one's big. Censorship. Describe what that's like
[2:20:03.200 --> 2:20:08.000]  and how it's escalated even Trump being censored now. Stephen Crowder, you guys do his show a
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:12.080]  lot. They're really trying to cancel him. Describe what it's like right now for people that don't
[2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:16.720]  know. I mean, it's horrible. I mean, when you think of censorship, you would think it would
[2:20:16.720 --> 2:20:20.400]  be based on somebody like creating videos to show you how to make a bomb or something.
[2:20:20.400 --> 2:20:25.920]  Right. Or somebody wearing a clan uniform preaching to go out and hurt people of color.
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:29.920]  That's not what's being censored. What's being censored is people speaking truth.
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:34.800]  Yeah. And people speaking their opinions politically. It's all one sided too.
[2:20:34.800 --> 2:20:40.160]  And it's all a threat to the left. So they censor you and call it something that you're not doing.
[2:20:40.160 --> 2:20:44.160]  You can be with Black Lives Matter. You can go on YouTube wherever and say
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:49.520]  looting is reparations. Yeah. You can go in and say you're going to kill police officers.
[2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:53.520]  None of that's going to be in sight violence. None of it's censor. Stephen Crowder goes out
[2:20:53.520 --> 2:21:00.000]  and investigates these fake addresses in Nevada and Vegas. And it's actual journalism. What do
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:05.440]  they do? They ban them off of YouTube for a week. They delete his videos because he's actually doing
[2:21:05.440 --> 2:21:10.240]  journalism. A comedian is doing more journalism than the actual journalists today. And everything's
[2:21:10.240 --> 2:21:15.920]  very far by, Alex. He's not spreading lies. He's actually showing the address that someone registered
[2:21:15.920 --> 2:21:21.200]  to vote actually voted from and nobody lives there. Yeah. Investigated it. Yeah. But no,
[2:21:21.200 --> 2:21:27.040]  he's spreading misinformation. False. Yeah, misinformation. He's a right wing white supremacist.
[2:21:27.040 --> 2:21:32.640]  Let's just ban them forward. When it comes to conservatism and what's going on in that country,
[2:21:33.200 --> 2:21:37.520]  the left, when they do it, it's okay. Like the whole thing about Russian collusion.
[2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:42.080]  They investigated it for two years. It was all a lie. Yeah. But if we want people to investigate
[2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:47.120]  elections, make sure it was an honorable election. It was, you know, it was legit.
[2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:52.480]  They call us right wing conspiracy theories. Yeah. It's like, it's just madness. It doesn't
[2:21:52.480 --> 2:21:57.840]  make any sense. Let's expand on that because I know you guys had guessed on as I've seen it
[2:21:57.840 --> 2:22:03.520]  and talked about the Wuhan leak and that possibly being it. Everybody got censored to talk about it.
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:09.120]  Now we're all vindicated. So who gives big tech that power to say that only the UN can officially
[2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:14.400]  say what's happened with the virus? That is so dangerous. Yeah, right. And no one actually gave
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:20.240]  them that power. What's going on with big tech? They're misinterpreting laws and nobody's enforcing
[2:22:20.240 --> 2:22:25.040]  the laws accurately. Yeah. Big tech is giving them the power because we all have a voice.
[2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:28.960]  Whether you got five subscribers or a thousand subscribers, we all have a voice,
[2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:34.160]  but big tech is coming in assisting China, assisting the left, assisting the Biden administration.
[2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:39.200]  And nobody on the left is going to step in because that's one of that cash cows. That's how
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:44.000]  Biden, you know, if you want to say that's how he got elected because they never even shared the
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:50.800]  story about his son. If you talked about his son and his ties with China and Ukraine and making
[2:22:50.800 --> 2:22:55.840]  millions and billions of dollars, you will get your post removing if you did it repeatedly,
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:23:00.800]  they would ban you. Right. Just for talking about it, sharing opinions, the same thing that the
[2:23:00.800 --> 2:23:05.440]  left is doing, but what the left is doing is misinterpreting everything, misrepresenting
[2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:09.280]  everything. They are the ones that spread misinformation. That's right. And Hunter is
[2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:15.440]  now going to teach an ethics class at a major university in New Orleans. What a joke. Right.
[2:23:16.400 --> 2:23:22.640]  Yeah, they have no ethics. None at all. Speaking of that, what do you make of Hunter and the
[2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:27.920]  laptop and all this stuff coming out with the so-called president meeting with the Chinese,
[2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:32.400]  something you lied about, all the weird stuff on that. Meanwhile, the left is saying they want to
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:36.640]  indict Trump in New York probably within the next month. I mean, they're saying they're going to
[2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:42.400]  indict him for fraud, for overvaluing hotels. If a bank gives you a loan, they come out and
[2:23:42.400 --> 2:23:47.280]  inspect the property, they give you the value they want. The idea that it's fraud, that he was
[2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:52.800]  given $300 million on a property, a loan against it. Well, that's what the bank did. That's their
[2:23:52.800 --> 2:23:58.640]  right. Right. And you know what, Alex? The main reason why mainstream media is talking about this
[2:23:58.640 --> 2:24:04.080]  is because Trump brings in the ratings. Trump is not filling out his own tax return. Trump is not
[2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:11.280]  going out there evaluating his properties. He has people, he has workers that do all that for him.
[2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:15.120]  Yeah, but see, the left, they prey on people's ignors. Like they said, he didn't pay any taxes,
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:19.600]  or you pay like $5,000 in taxes. They prey on people's ignors thinking,
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:25.120]  Donald Trump sits down every year and fills out a 1040 EZ. Right. Exactly. I'm not as important
[2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:30.800]  as him by a hundred times. I'm smaller. I don't feel any of that. I don't have time to do that.
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:35.520]  Right. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure that man's tax returns looks like a damn dictionary,
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:39.680]  so thick. And he has accountants, CPAs to handle that stuff.
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:44.480]  Alex, it's all speculation. None of it's true. It's all of its theater. That's all it is. They
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:50.560]  would never, they have investigated Trump for the last five years and found absolutely nothing.
[2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:55.040]  Yeah. Y'all don't think they already dug into all of this stuff? I mean, what they're doing is
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:59.040]  they're actually trying to, you know, defame Trump because they're very worried that he's going to
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:03.760]  run again. Well, that's it. They're scared of him getting all these great people elected
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:06.960]  because when he backs the candidate, they're winning by record margins. So that's why they're
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:11.440]  doing this. Right. Yeah. He's a threat. He's a threat to what the left wants to do.
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:17.280]  Man, it's like, I remember when Trump announced he was running, everybody thought he was a joke.
[2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:21.280]  People on the right thought he was a joke. And he made everybody, the left and the right,
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:26.560]  look like fools. And he just became this power. Nobody could stop. So now that what they're doing
[2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:32.800]  is the line on them. They're making them out to be something that is not. And if Trump is the evil
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:38.080]  person they made him out to be, over these last five years investigation, everything would have
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:42.880]  been shown. It would have, everything would have fell out of his closet. I want to ask you guys,
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:46.880]  you've got to get a crystal ball. If they do indict him, what is the backlash of that with
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:58.240]  the hodge twins? I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us. Your voice counts. When you share information,

[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:56.960]  A lot of virtuous signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:01.280]  and how much they care about veterans but at the same time they won't stand up for what those
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:07.360]  veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of US history. And now more than
[2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:13.040]  ever what our republic stands for and is stood for is under attack. America is under globalist
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:19.760]  takeover. It's an information war. It is an economic war but most importantly it is a spiritual war.
[2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:26.080]  And now of course it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines. We were the first to tell
[2:28:26.080 --> 2:28:30.160]  you that the virus came out of Wuhan. We were the first to tell you that vaccine passports were
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:34.560]  coming. We were the first to lay out basically everything because we actually do our research
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:38.000]  and know what we're talking about. And that's why it's important to keep info wars in the air
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:42.400]  now more than ever. And for Memorial Day week we're having store wide free shipping and double

[2:30:51.600 --> 2:30:57.760]  knows it and polls and numbers are showing we've covered these that when they first stole the
[2:30:57.760 --> 2:31:04.640]  election six seven months ago it was 65 percent of the public on average stopped that now it's
[2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:10.080]  over 70 percent even higher when it comes to conservatives it's coming up towards the majority
[2:31:10.080 --> 2:31:14.720]  of democrats thinking the election was stole no one is buying this people are getting real remorse
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:20.080]  who did vote for biden where do you guys see this going if they're dumb enough
[2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:26.880]  up in new york with that uh minion of or minions of george soros leticia james and others
[2:31:26.880 --> 2:31:32.000]  indicting trump either at the state level or the local level what do you think the backlash of that
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:38.320]  will be um i don't i don't think they're gonna um get an indictment on him i mean he's the most
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:42.960]  vetted president we've ever had everybody's investigated this man they have found nothing
[2:31:42.960 --> 2:31:48.000]  i'd be shocked if they found anything yeah i think more than anything alex it's just a distraction
[2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:52.400]  because they're doing the audits in arizona in nevada that's what they're really doing it's just
[2:31:52.400 --> 2:31:57.360]  a distraction what biden's doing in tollsville i mean everybody on mainstream media on the left
[2:31:57.360 --> 2:32:03.120]  is just lost their minds talking about when they started actually auditing the results
[2:32:03.120 --> 2:32:08.400]  i'm like i don't understand why they will be so upset and let's take trying to hide something
[2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:16.160]  if if you're so sure that biden won that election honestly why don't you let everybody go in out of
[2:32:16.160 --> 2:32:22.480]  the result and just show and tell everybody that's on the right how stupid and naive they are i mean
[2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:28.960]  you have a golden opportunity to show everybody in america how lost trump supporters are yeah i will
[2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:33.360]  i will be willing to show that alex look at the results he won here he won here he won here but
[2:32:33.360 --> 2:32:36.720]  they don't want to do that don't even want to investigate the results on audit because scared
[2:32:36.720 --> 2:32:41.840]  was going to be uncovered right because it didn't make sense because tonight the election started
[2:32:41.840 --> 2:32:46.960]  when i went to sleep trump was up he was up big and it was everything was going his way
[2:32:46.960 --> 2:32:53.440]  and then like a flip of a switch yeah it all turned to biden but uh i think i don't think
[2:32:53.440 --> 2:32:57.920]  there's going to be any indictments on trump i think that this is just for ratings yeah i mean
[2:32:57.920 --> 2:33:02.160]  trump was great for ratings they didn't want him in the office denny's out of his like damn my
[2:33:02.160 --> 2:33:06.160]  ratings suck let's talk about how you think they're just saying that to distract from the election
[2:33:06.160 --> 2:33:13.280]  fraud i agree you think you're just saying that uh to to distract away from our horrible bideness yeah
[2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:19.600]  yeah that's exactly what's going on this everything is a distraction what's really going on the thing
[2:33:19.600 --> 2:33:24.400]  about what's going on in wuhan about the virus what's going on in an audit everything is just a
[2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:29.680]  distraction to keep people focused on racism and other things this doesn't mean anything this
[2:33:29.680 --> 2:33:35.040]  trivial there's not going to help america become a better country i totally agree with you but they
[2:33:35.040 --> 2:33:39.280]  are saying they're gonna indicting uh and and then they want to do about july 4th but maybe
[2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:43.920]  that's all smoke and mirrors like everything else they say it's a blood because because they are
[2:33:43.920 --> 2:33:49.440]  desperate and i even see it in his headlines like democracy in peril you can't do this because now
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:56.240]  pennsylvania wants to do it georgia sin they know and the word is they found 17 plus percent
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:02.160]  disparity all of it going to trump if he found one percent in maricopa county he would have won
[2:34:02.160 --> 2:34:07.600]  they're talking last number 70 percent or more of course all flip to biden what are they going
[2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:14.800]  to do when those numbers come out oh man what can they do at that point if it comes out right
[2:34:14.800 --> 2:34:19.680]  that's all we're waiting for is it to come out but they have all these enablers in place right
[2:34:19.680 --> 2:34:23.760]  keeping this information from coming out and this indictment is going i hear it's coming
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:29.280]  and soon as come any day now i heard that for two years from russia yeah and nothing ever came
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:33.840]  of that so i don't believe anything the media says once i start seeing some actual evidence
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:38.560]  that something went all right all right then i would say okay maybe something there but there's
[2:34:38.560 --> 2:34:43.280]  nothing there and what's going on with president trump and and how they're investigating him they
[2:34:43.280 --> 2:34:49.360]  no president has ever been treated like this no i mean they only in here in america we only treat
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:55.520]  criminals this way people just in gains mafia things of that sort but we've never treated a
[2:34:55.520 --> 2:35:01.680]  president of the united states this way never yeah let's say in some about how radical our government
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:06.320]  has became yeah not just the department how how radical they are because well take the head of
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:12.480]  space force he got fired two weeks ago three weeks ago because he said on a show there is a real
[2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:18.560]  danger of marxism in the military and black lives matter is promoting marxism the founder says it's
[2:35:18.560 --> 2:35:24.800]  a marxist ideology so since when is stating the truth grounds to be fired this this ought to really
[2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:30.560]  show people how much trouble we're in right yeah start cutting people's tongues out yeah start getting
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:36.960]  rid of people right i mean how about keeping everybody open to debate that's how society moves
[2:35:36.960 --> 2:35:42.240]  forward you hear from both sides and then from there we move forward let me ask you guys if you
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:47.200]  were in tulsa if you were in tulsa where they had the new black panther party running around sounding
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:51.840]  like a black version of the kkk or beyond saying we're gonna kill the white people we can't wait
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:56.400]  till there's a race war and all this craziness what would you say to those guys because they
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:00.320]  genuinely act like they really believe this craziness well what would you say to them where's
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:06.400]  there's just no point uh i think some people just lost you can't help them or draw them you can't
[2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:12.320]  help them i'm sure there's a small percentage of them that's open to reason but you don't fight
[2:36:12.320 --> 2:36:18.880]  racism with more racism right i mean you're you're sharing the same ideologies that the kkk and white
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:24.400]  supremacists and hillary use yeah you have the same ideologies just because you black that makes it
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:29.360]  okay but then again the left they push these ideas that it's okay for black black people don't have the
[2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:35.600]  power to be racist and that's how things like this come to be and really the left knows what
[2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:39.200]  they're doing they admit this in the internal wiki leaks document for hillary's part of this
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:44.000]  top psychologist they want to isolate groups so they get whites to be racist blacks be racist
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:48.160]  and everybody's scared and hate each other it means we're killing each other and now they control
[2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:53.920]  us because we're isolated yeah divide and conquer i mean charles balkley pointed that out
[2:36:53.920 --> 2:36:58.960]  about about a couple months ago i mean i think he took the easy way out but um i think the majority
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:04.080]  was wrong in his country it's not it's it's it's coming from one side alex is everybody on the left
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:07.840]  i mean we're here on the right we're not perfect but we you hold up better than what's going on the
[2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:12.880]  left because on the left they like to call themselves liberal it's nothing liberal about that party
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:17.520]  it's nothing also i agree isn't it transparent though that it's the establishment it's the banks
[2:37:17.520 --> 2:37:22.560]  the media the universities hollywood is to lead you the chica they're all against america and
[2:37:22.560 --> 2:37:27.360]  they're all saying america's racist it's it's that's the establishment the power structure is doing
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:33.120]  this to hide what they're doing taking the country over yeah and that and that's the platform the
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:39.120]  democrats stand for they are against the elites but their constituents they fall for it and think
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:43.840]  they're they're against the elites now they're for the elites yeah they for the big corporations
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:48.480]  they're not for the ma and pa little child yeah they shut down yeah during covid they shut down all
[2:37:48.480 --> 2:37:53.200]  these uh small business and look at the big corporations they florist made more money they
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:58.480]  ever made in their life yeah and but the left the constituency they don't see it yeah it's like
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:02.240]  what the hell are y'all looking at y'all don't see what's going on and now they love bill gates and
[2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:06.880]  want him to be our doctor you just wanted to get to dissantis man is he not really proving
[2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:11.360]  himself to be a star the way he gets comments and stuff speaking of keeping small businesses open
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:18.320]  yeah right right he's very sharp i mean he will i'm pretty sure he's gonna be the i'm not sure when
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:23.280]  but i i'm when i see him talking the way he cares himself he's very sharp he never loses his cool
[2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:28.160]  he might raise his voice and get stern with you but he's he's always comfortable what he's saying
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:33.440]  it's just yeah he's just you know so renewing to see a republican that actually stands up and
[2:38:33.440 --> 2:38:38.320]  fights for what he believes in yeah he has he's an excellent example of what a leader should
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:44.320]  sound certainly i agree he's got presidential written all over him yeah two terms and it's
[2:38:44.320 --> 2:38:52.480]  what's amazing is when he won governor florida he won by like 3000 votes i mean it was ridiculous
[2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:57.520]  both of them had 49% in a vote and it's like you look at his candidate the guy that he beat yeah
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:04.160]  this guy was just complete garbage right and for him to just barely speak by shows you that
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:10.400]  there is election issues all over this country yeah it's a red state or blue state and that man he
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:16.160]  he and his platform that he ran against when he ran against his dissenters that he was a racist
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:20.480]  yeah i agree and i don't go off color i go off people but wouldn't alan west making great governor
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:29.040]  of texas so hell yeah man it's it's um but getting into politics it just there's a lot of great people
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:35.280]  out there that should be running for office but politics is so polarizing but especially for
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:40.400]  black americans i mean you're kicking it from both ends let's talk about that when we come back
[2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:45.120]  yeah absolutely wow imagine if you're black or white you get issues but imagine if you're a black
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:53.520]  conservative you get more heat than anybody we'll be right back stay with us i've been on there 27
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:59.200]  years and we've gone through a lot of criticism a lot of attacks but also a lot of amazing support
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:03.600]  and so that's why i always take time out to thank you for keeping us on there because without you
[2:40:03.600 --> 2:40:08.560]  without the crew without our sponsors without our affiliates without everybody we would not be on
[2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:12.800]  air and the world would be a different place so it's not a power trip when i realized the great
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:20.240]  effect we've had it's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here if you hadn't
[2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:25.520]  have supported us the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalist instead
[2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:29.440]  a lot of really really positive things are happening and so many of the corrupt things the
[2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:34.160]  globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open and so info wars credibility is
[2:40:34.160 --> 2:40:39.120]  higher than it's ever been but the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:43.360]  we've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air it's so expensive so please get great
[2:40:43.360 --> 2:40:48.560]  products and keep info wars on the air at the same time at infowarstore.com in fact for the week of
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:53.200]  memorial day we have fraud free shipping and double patriot points you know i'm cutting
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:57.360]  out right now and i've been here on the saturday cutting days i've done a terrible job because
[2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:05.200]  i just cut like five ads and i didn't tell people the most important part no it's not that dna force
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:10.720]  plus has been sold out for seven months and it's back in stock and it's 40 off or how the supply

[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:57.120]  i always shoot you straight and when i've told you over the years that if you don't support us
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:04.000]  we'll be off the air it's been true but info wars has never been in a position where your support
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:08.640]  is more critical and more vital the enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things i'm not going
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:13.520]  to take time up to whine about it it's okay i expect to be attacked because we're over the target
[2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:18.560]  we're having a great effect we're exposing evil you're exposing evil so you spread the
[2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:22.480]  word about the broadcast or when you buy products or when you pray for info wars and
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:30.960]  our talk show hosts and our crew it is so powerful so again as memorial day 2021 comes and goes
[2:42:30.960 --> 2:42:35.440]  i want all of you to realize that i appreciate you as being veterans of the info war and i
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:39.760]  particularly think our veterans as well that have served the armed forces because they understand
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:44.800]  what it is to sacrifice and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our republic
[2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:48.880]  to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now so it's a very
[2:42:48.880 --> 2:42:52.480]  historical time to be alive i want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us again
[2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:56.400]  when i get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold out for
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:00.800]  three months four months six months seven months it's not a gimmick to make you buy the products
[2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:05.680]  i'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements and
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:09.760]  books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation because they're great products we're coming back
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:14.400]  and getting more and thank you for the support but whether it's dna force plus or whether it's
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:21.040]  pollen block uh or whether it's supermobility or vaso beats because of the ongoing lockdowns
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:25.360]  around the world we're not going to lower the quality of our products and so we just can't
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:30.320]  offer them but thank god it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:34.400]  because suddenly a lot of products have been sold out for a long time are back in stock and one of
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:40.080]  them is pollen block takes a long time to get into pollen block but it's for seasonal discomfort
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:45.680]  stuff like allergies it's from france it's a special proprietary system this is the highest
[2:43:45.680 --> 2:43:51.440]  quality back in stock infowarstore.com store-wide free shipping and double patriot points check it out

[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:30.880]  that hour and i was just in the break room getting myself a cup of coffee and fox news had their
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:37.520]  medical doctor ron saying all these big sunscreens have been recalled because they have toxic chemicals
[2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:43.200]  in them well i think we're sold out of it now but we got a sunscreen made that had none of the toxic
[2:44:43.200 --> 2:44:47.600]  chemicals all you need is the zinc folks you don't need any of that crap but it turned out all the
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:52.800]  ones i've told my wife and everybody not to get the spray ones and all that have toxic levels of
[2:44:52.800 --> 2:44:57.360]  carcinogens and give you skin cancer it's it's just unbelievable ladies and gentlemen we've known
[2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:02.160]  this for decades but i'm going to play part of that fox news piece and comment on it before jerald

[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:28.720]  who i've been watching these guys for i don't know six years or so at least maybe longer uh they
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:32.400]  should just mainly do comedy and stuff they started doing a talk show years ago it's gotten to be
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:38.240]  one of the top conservative talk shows out there uh and i tell you they're very polite on my show
[2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:42.880]  and let me interrupt and talk a lot but they really they're doing a great job but they do a great job
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:46.800]  when it's just the two of them there and it's also the craziness is there's two guys up there
[2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:50.880]  they're twins so i just love it gentlemen there's a lot of other things going on a lot of other
[2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:56.560]  points questions i could ask you about about uh again all the human smuggling and and what he's
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:00.960]  doing george sloy memorial all the death that's happening there uh and so much more but what
[2:46:00.960 --> 2:46:06.080]  else is on your radar screen that's that that's that's that's got a you know a bur under your
[2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:09.680]  saddle that you're covering on your show that you want to tell my audience about
[2:46:11.680 --> 2:46:18.000]  yeah i mean that george floyd memorial that's a that's an excellent excellent representation of um
[2:46:18.560 --> 2:46:25.360]  what george floyd stood for great representation yeah i mean i mean in that area there's no cops
[2:46:25.360 --> 2:46:30.480]  a lot it's an autonomous zone right and but there's people actually i think there's been two murders
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:37.920]  within that little zone right drive by shooting that george floyd memorial is a excellent um validation
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:45.040]  for what uh everyone should be against as far as no police the fund police this is what happens
[2:46:45.040 --> 2:46:49.760]  i mean this happens when there's police around when you defund the police you turn your country
[2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:54.400]  or your air or whoever defunds the police into somalia yeah defunding the police you take away
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:47:02.560]  the biggest deterrent for crime if nobody if if i if i'm a if i'm a criminal in that area i have no
[2:47:03.680 --> 2:47:07.440]  i'm not being scared of any repercussions or anything happening because there's no one
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:12.880]  to investigate there's no one there to prevent me yeah what makes america is our freedom in law and
[2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:18.480]  order yeah police a civilized society yeah our justice system yeah but without that you don't
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:23.760]  have freedom you live in in fear you you're pretty much in somalia but what exactly what about all
[2:47:23.760 --> 2:47:31.280]  the weird this and time is on they think that it's safer to go without police yeah dumb well but but
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:35.760]  instead with the antifa that took it over a bunch of weird method white people you've seen the videos
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:40.800]  i'm sure where they won't let other white people into that area of the town because they're white
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:50.640]  but they're white it's just crazy it doesn't make like nothing makes any sense it's like i mean
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:55.360]  yeah i mean when you see like the the riots and stuff when they're burning businesses down
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:59.600]  it's like a bunch of white people going to the blackers it's the only time they go in there right
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:05.040]  and they instigate everything and it's like and and black people just watch it and watch it happen
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.200]  and they don't realize that you're you're only hurting yourself yeah you watch these people
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:13.440]  coming your own communities and burning down your own windows your target everything that in
[2:48:13.440 --> 2:48:17.840]  your communities and then they leave yeah these things with nothing yeah these same people called
[2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:23.920]  us nazis i'm like i don't even meet the prerequisite to be a nazi antifa does
[2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:30.400]  i just i don't get it i mean it's just everybody on the left alex is just picking on a lot of
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:36.560]  low IQ people a lot of brain dead people and i hate to see it i mean that you know what alex
[2:48:36.560 --> 2:48:42.720]  in this country i don't care how many civil rights laws you pass equality laws you pass
[2:48:42.720 --> 2:48:46.720]  there will always be slaves in these countries because there's always going to be the ignorant
[2:48:46.720 --> 2:48:52.320]  people in the in dip in these demographics of races that doesn't know what's going on and
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:56.480]  they easily manipulate because they don't do their own research and they don't think for themselves
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:00.960]  they let somebody on mainstream media talk to them and decide what's good and what's bad well
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:05.680]  here's a great example the adl and sort of bribery law center called for me to be taken off the air
[2:49:05.680 --> 2:49:10.080]  they called for mark zuckerberg to be arrested if they don't do what what the liberals say at the
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:14.560]  adl meeting i've never said anything racist about anybody i want everybody living peace to come
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:20.480]  together i'm a christian but then the founder of black lives matter says israel shouldn't exist
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:26.240]  and makes anti-jews statements the left loves her but then calls me an anti-semite it's bizarre
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:38.080]  right i can't even put in the words how i'm just dumb some people are it takes i mean and it's
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:43.600]  always going to be a element of people and society is very ignorant and dumb because it actually takes
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:48.960]  energy to educate yourself and there's always going to be that element in society who don't
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:56.320]  take energy to educate themselves and that's who the left prays upon the lazy the ignorant
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:50:01.200]  and they feed them with all this bs they tell them what they want to hear and it galvanizes
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:06.080]  these morons to fight for them and you know conservatives and you know the conservative
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:10.080]  mind said you know we're hard workers we're business owners we believe in freedom we'll be
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:14.800]  even the second man we believe in the foundations of what you know brought this country together
[2:50:14.800 --> 2:50:19.520]  and what made this country so great but everybody on the left has been then teach these people that
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:24.800]  everything about america is evil and you don't need cop you don't need to uh baby to protect yourself
[2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:29.520]  you don't need to go out there and start your own business the government is here to protect you
[2:50:29.520 --> 2:50:37.680]  and to take care of you which never ever works anywhere in history ever i've got one last big
[2:50:37.680 --> 2:50:41.840]  question for both of you the hodge twins here with us live on this wednesday broadcast feels
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:47.920]  like a tuesday because the memorial day a holiday how do we draft trump to make sure he runs again
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:50.880]  because i know he's lost a lot of weight he's working out a lot playing a lot of golf he looks
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:55.120]  good i think the sand is thought of running his vp i think that's an unstoppable ticket
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:50:57.760]  they're gonna say oh they're two white dudes i don't care they were two black guys they have the
[2:50:57.760 --> 2:51:02.160]  same ideas i'm both former two women i don't i'm looking at results and both guys have proven
[2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:06.640]  themselves uh but but i know that he had i was critical of his website he launched two weeks
[2:51:06.640 --> 2:51:12.240]  ago or two months ago excuse me because it it wasn't interactive it was basically a blog site
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:17.600]  and trump took his site down today your office of the president because it didn't it didn't work
[2:51:17.600 --> 2:51:22.880]  he can't even get videos posted with the people around him that i know are sabotaging him
[2:51:22.880 --> 2:51:28.640]  meanwhile places like gab has two and a half million members for him with video and everything
[2:51:28.640 --> 2:51:33.920]  ready they've been trying to give it to him for for two years before he even lost he doesn't even
[2:51:33.920 --> 2:51:39.840]  have social media he has two million followers on gab if he joined gab tomorrow and get 10 million
[2:51:39.840 --> 2:51:44.640]  the site works good they've gotten the bugs out we need to get a message to trump i don't have
[2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:49.280]  any stock in gab i have a video site on gab hundreds of thousands of followers but but but but you
[2:51:49.280 --> 2:51:55.280]  know we he's the platform he needs to get on these other platforms now he needs to be on rumble
[2:51:55.280 --> 2:52:00.000]  he needs to be on gab he needs to be out there instead of i know for a fact there are people
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:05.360]  around them they're quietly sabotaging him right yeah and big text behind it that's why they ban him
[2:52:05.360 --> 2:52:09.680]  from every social media platform is out there because they don't want him to be able to communicate
[2:52:09.680 --> 2:52:15.760]  with other conservative like-minded americans yeah maybe he's uh i thought he had some kind of
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:21.520]  social media platform in the works maybe that's what he's waiting to uh um to let everybody see
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:26.320]  and not somebody else's platform because you know trump he wants his own thing yeah his platform
[2:52:26.320 --> 2:52:32.640]  probably gonna be called trump so i guarantee andrew torba would probably sign it over to trump
[2:52:32.640 --> 2:52:36.640]  and trump will just give him the time of day but i mean i've talked to folks that meet with trump a
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:40.640]  lot of them around him and you know they're either lightweight so they're just rich republicans and
[2:52:40.640 --> 2:52:45.040]  they just don't they want to just play golf and you know he doesn't have hardcore people around
[2:52:45.040 --> 2:52:49.280]  to know what they're doing and that's why they try to you know keep me and roger away from him
[2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:53.200]  because we at least you know know how politics and media runs and i'm telling you trump needs
[2:52:53.200 --> 2:52:57.760]  his own video platform at least a site where he can put a video up and then archive the next one
[2:52:57.760 --> 2:53:01.520]  they'd have 10 million views every video he's got to operate all people with their phones when he
[2:53:01.520 --> 2:53:08.560]  gives a speech yeah all this is true i just i'm just thinking maybe he's got just got something
[2:53:08.560 --> 2:53:12.800]  else playing what's your plan your plan sounded great don't get me wrong but i'm just hey i want
[2:53:12.800 --> 2:53:17.200]  him to reach out to steven crowder i want him to reach out to you guys he just i mean you guys
[2:53:17.200 --> 2:53:21.840]  have got the technical ability to give him his own show i mean i'm telling you the former president
[2:53:21.840 --> 2:53:26.800]  they stole the election he's the most important person on earth and he is cut off gentlemen thank
[2:53:26.800 --> 2:53:31.680]  you so much for all you do the hodge twins you're coming to texas and people can find your comedy
[2:53:31.680 --> 2:53:35.840]  dates around the country and so i'm going to come see you in san Antonio when you're here god bless
[2:53:35.840 --> 2:53:40.640]  you thank you thank you all right that was a powerful interview with those guys and i want them
[2:53:40.640 --> 2:53:45.840]  to lobby trump and everybody else to get trump back on air i don't care where it is trump means
[2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:50.480]  to host his own radio show every day or something my god hundreds of radio stations was picking up
[2:53:50.480 --> 2:53:55.600]  he ought to take over rush limbaugh slot he could host an hour a day and then other other guest
[2:53:55.600 --> 2:54:00.960]  hosts would take over it'd be on 600 radio stations it's just i'm watching trump as they try to
[2:54:00.960 --> 2:54:05.680]  indict him being set up okay i'm gonna come back hit some huge news concerning the vaccines that
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:12.480]  just broke that is crazy remember the remember the magnet sticking on people's arms after they
[2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:18.080]  take the shot well we got something here on that it's pretty crazy and then sunscreen causing cancer
[2:54:18.080 --> 2:54:22.080]  we've known this forever it's not the sunscreen doing it it's the chemicals which they did on
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:26.960]  purpose the fda allows it and now that house of cards is coming down it's the chemicals they put
[2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:32.240]  in everyday products on purpose that's why we have to save the frogs project t-shirts now available
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:36.960]  we'll have this new website soon about save the frogs it's really about save the people we'll be
[2:54:36.960 --> 2:54:45.360]  right back with hour number four gerolson lindsay as well memorial day 2021 is here and that means

[2:56:42.880 --> 2:57:01.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:09.760]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm going to be covering this on the war room today
[2:57:09.760 --> 2:57:14.480]  in about an hour i'll be hosting today with rob do roger stone's got exclusive news but i want to
[2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:21.440]  get to this a prelude to what's coming up today three p.m. central you'll want to join us genetically
[2:57:21.440 --> 2:57:29.440]  engineered magneto protein remotely controls brain and behavior that is out of the guardian what did
[2:57:29.440 --> 2:57:34.160]  i tell you a year and a half ago one of the things they want to do is it's proteins that are magnetic
[2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:38.480]  that will grow in the whole body so they can basically hit you with a certain wave and make
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:46.080]  them grow really fast and kill you for behavioral modification we're not in kansas anymore you've
[2:57:46.080 --> 2:57:51.520]  seen all the videos of magnets sticking to people's arms now scientists have confirmed it's happening
[2:57:51.520 --> 2:57:57.360]  in italy and more we'll show you that in a moment but here it is researchers in the united states
[2:57:57.360 --> 2:58:01.520]  have developed a new method for controlling the brain circuits associated with complex
[2:58:01.520 --> 2:58:06.560]  animal behaviors using genetically engineered genetically engineering to create magnetized
[2:58:06.560 --> 2:58:12.160]  protein that activates specific groups of nerve cells from a distance now what did i tell you
[2:58:12.160 --> 2:58:20.640]  years ago how to butterflies or how do geese know to fly from canada all the way to central america
[2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:28.160]  without radar they follow magnetic lines that it's the same thing and they believe it's that
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:34.560]  those magnetic lines those magnetic cones we have are what are able to access higher dimensions higher
[2:58:34.560 --> 2:58:40.800]  spirituality beyond the pineal gland and so they want to jam that circuit and that's what we told
[2:58:40.800 --> 2:58:46.080]  you years ago here it is admitting the whole thing so people getting the shots really are getting
[2:58:46.080 --> 2:58:54.000]  cut off from god the mark of the beast is marking them understanding how the brain generates behavior
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:58:59.520]  is one of the ultimate goals of neuroscience and one of its most difficult questions in recent years
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:03.680]  readers have developed a number of methods that enable them to remotely control specific groups
[2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:11.280]  of neurons and to probe the workings of neurological circuits the most powerful of these is called
[2:59:11.840 --> 2:59:18.320]  optogenetics which enables researchers to switch populations of related neurons on or off on a
[2:59:18.320 --> 2:59:23.280]  millisecond a millisecond timescale with pulses of laser light another recently developed method
[2:59:23.280 --> 2:59:30.560]  called chemogenetics uses engineered proteins that are activated by designer drugs and can be
[2:59:30.560 --> 2:59:36.480]  targeted to specific cell types they're they're they're they're just marking you preparing you
[2:59:36.480 --> 2:59:42.800]  for this whole revolution of behavior modifying injections they call vaccines from my old video
[2:59:42.800 --> 2:59:48.160]  i did 10 years ago about brain eating vaccines in fact let's find brain eating vaccines we're
[2:59:48.160 --> 2:59:52.160]  going to air that on the war room today that that classic you know they've got 20 million views on
[2:59:52.160 --> 2:59:56.880]  youtube where they took it down so that's all coming up here it is genetically engineered
[2:59:56.880 --> 3:00:02.560]  magneto protein remotely controls brain and behavior london guardian so they're throwing it all
[3:00:03.440 --> 3:00:11.360]  in the good little slaves faces that's what they're doing uh let's go ahead though and just roll some
[3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:16.880]  of the italian scientists on tv with the magnets sticking to arms now cell phones are sticking
[3:00:16.880 --> 3:00:22.720]  to arms of those that have taken these poison shots here it is protein particulars that are
[3:00:22.720 --> 3:00:33.760]  sensitive to magnetic fields they are proteins that react to the calamity just like iron so
[3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:40.480]  one of the possibilities is that in these products there are these these particular proteins these
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:48.640]  proteins need to be made so that it jumps before it was on the right spot it didn't stick but just
[3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:53.520]  like you see with the magnet when it finds metal it jumps to it to the you see that it jumped to it
[3:00:54.960 --> 3:01:02.560]  my god they've hit us with a prion metal it's really true i will break all this down today
[3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:08.480]  3 p.m central standard time they just did it and they've committed a crime so massive so huge
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:12.240]  they think the victims of it will stock home out and just start supporting it going well i do it
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:17.920]  again i'm a hero's why i took it i want to be safe from covid 19 when they got you to literally take
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:30.160]  a thing that grows prion systems that are magnetic proteins wow one and guardian look at this magnetic
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:36.960]  proteins magnetic proteins god help us and look at that my lord and then they're self
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:41.760]  replicating and i know a lot of people have taken the deadly shots they they look their skin kind of
[3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:46.400]  hangs on them now they're just kind of lower energy old people that take it go into a brain fog
[3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:54.800]  god they've they've done it they really did it wow memorial day 2021 has come and gone
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:02:00.000]  but the fight against the globalist continues and the huge mega sale the biggest of the year
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:07.760]  is now ongoing until this sunday so you've got as of time i'm taking this report about four days

[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:15.680]  well joe biden really loves black people he wants black businesses i guess take federal money to
[3:03:15.680 --> 3:03:20.560]  try to bully blacks into taking the so-called vaccine that now even one and guardian admits
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:25.840]  they have technologies to put magnetic proteins into you that then replicate so they can control
[3:03:25.840 --> 3:03:31.040]  your mind one and guardian genetically engineered magneto protein remotely controls brains and
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:35.280]  behavior and now they're announcing well it's all for your own good and scientists readily are
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:39.840]  confirming this is happening with whatever they're putting in the shots that is again a protein well
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:46.720]  what does this do it makes your cells grow the spike protein that again is electromagnetic this
[3:03:46.720 --> 3:03:54.720]  is insane here's joe biden in the spirit of meeting people where they are will also be working with
[3:03:54.720 --> 3:04:01.360]  a black coalition against covet and other organizations will launch a new initiative called
[3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:08.960]  shots at the shop barbershops beauty shops are hubs of activity information in black and brown
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:15.280]  communities particular but in many communities across the nation local barbers stylists they
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:23.280]  become key advocates for vaccinations in their communities wow now i want to play a clip from
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:28.240]  fox and then we'll segue out and jerry solente is going to be taking over after this i'll be
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:33.920]  covering this more in the war room in about 53 minutes from now we've always known that industrial
[3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:41.840]  um skin creams not just sunscreens are full of carcinogens and the FDA allowed this just like
[3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:46.240]  they're doing emergency authorization for these franken shots that's what my whole initiative
[3:04:46.240 --> 3:04:51.200]  of exposing what's in the household products and what's in the water that's sterilizing the frogs
[3:04:51.200 --> 3:04:56.400]  the birds and the humans that's why the sperm count is plummeting and we have the new t-shirt
[3:04:56.400 --> 3:05:03.440]  available at infowarstore.com and black green and light cream with save the frogs info wars.com
[3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:06.800]  good-looking shirts they caused a debate they caused a discussion we're going to build a whole
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:12.800]  site about endocrine disruptors and about the plasticizers and how this is all a globalist plan
[3:05:12.800 --> 3:05:19.360]  with their own admissions of how they're doing it but it takes plenty to do it 17.76 $17.76 info

[3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:08.480]  wait to listen to him here is fox news. there could actually cause cancer the wash job group
[3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:14.400]  valor sure reports finding cancer of fighting traces rather of cancer causing benzene in
[3:06:14.400 --> 3:06:19.280]  several major brands some of them with amounts higher than the guidelines for what's safe
[3:06:19.280 --> 3:06:24.560]  dr mark segal is a fox case contributor and professor of medicine at nyu langone medical
[3:06:24.560 --> 3:06:30.400]  center so mark we are told put on sunscreen cover your kids in sunscreen before they go
[3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:36.000]  out now valor sure has found that in some sunscreens there are levels that are above
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:42.480]  the acceptable level set by the fda what are we to make of this i'll put both together first of all
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:48.480]  john valor sure is the real deal it's not it's an important watchdog and the story is with us
[3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:53.600]  shaking off covid blues now we want everybody outside we want everybody at the beach we want
[3:06:53.600 --> 3:06:58.880]  everybody to get back in the action but we want them of course to wear sun protective clothing to
[3:06:58.880 --> 3:07:03.520]  stay in shade as much as possible and to wear plenty of sunscreen and you know the american
[3:07:03.520 --> 3:07:09.040]  academy of dermatology says that our younger people aren't aware that sunscreen prevents skin
[3:07:09.040 --> 3:07:15.520]  cancer it decreases squamous cell cancer by 40 percent melanoma by 50 percent we need sunscreen
[3:07:15.520 --> 3:07:20.720]  but i'll tell you the problem here is that valor sure found that in 27 percent of the products
[3:07:20.720 --> 3:07:26.720]  they looked at benzene was found now benzene actually has been linked as a carcinogen to
[3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:32.320]  blood cancers to leukemia and the problem is according to the dermatologist i spoke to john
[3:07:32.320 --> 3:07:37.520]  it gets in so it'll literally will get into your blood now the fda has said emergency
[3:07:37.520 --> 3:07:44.480]  amount two parts per million no more than that but valor sure found in 27 percent up to six
[3:07:44.480 --> 3:07:50.240]  parts per million and they're asking the fda to recall 40 batches of some of the major brands you
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:56.640]  showed now in the past valor sure has succeeded in that i want people to be aware of this i do not
[3:07:56.640 --> 3:08:01.680]  want them to not wear sunscreen though it is extremely important now just so that folks at
[3:08:01.680 --> 3:08:07.040]  home know what we're talking about here this is according to valor sure these are the brands and
[3:08:07.040 --> 3:08:12.480]  the sub brands that have the highest levels of benzene neutrogena ultra sheer weightless spray
[3:08:12.480 --> 3:08:19.280]  beach defense spray which i spray on my kids all the time daily defense sunbump cooldown gel cbs
[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:24.480]  health after sun spray and fruit of the earth aloe vera gel those again are the highest levels
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:30.240]  of benzene above two parts per million according to johnson and johnson which makes neutrogena
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:36.160]  quote benzene is not an ingredient in any of our personal care products and we are reviewing the
[3:08:36.160 --> 3:08:40.800]  findings presented in this petition but benzene is not an ingredient how's it getting in there
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:46.480]  so that's a really important point the way you laid that out it may have to do with the way that
[3:08:46.480 --> 3:08:51.920]  the product is made it may be in the processing of course it's not deliberately added but it's a
[3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:57.360]  solvent and the other point is you know i don't want people to think oh i had this product on
[3:08:57.360 --> 3:09:02.080]  i'm in trouble we're talking about lathering and lathering and lathering this on if you put it on
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:07.680]  your nose or you put it in some spots it's not going to be an issue it's more like assuring
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:13.920]  safety than i really believe that one sunscreen product is going to lead directly to blood cancer
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:19.040]  that's way overreaction and that's fear mongering and one other point you alluded to john we need a
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:25.040]  lot more studying on this we this is a wake-up call about about an ingredient but it is by no
[3:09:25.040 --> 3:09:30.320]  means proof all right well i think people can go online and look up the valesher study and
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:35.040]  find out what brand they would be comfortable with at least until all of this gets addressed
[3:09:35.040 --> 3:09:46.880]  dr mark seagull thank you for laying it out for us we always appreciate your thoughts
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:10:01.760]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex john show with gerald solente
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:11.200]  hey great being on alex go show you know they're just i'm very very very grateful to be on gallery

[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:24.240]  the world without being censored and what they're just talking about benzine how about the stuff
[3:10:24.240 --> 3:10:30.880]  uh that they put on your hands to sanitize them huh you see all the benzine that they found in these
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:38.640]  the fda how about the fu you know what da yeah take the d out and put a couple of letters in there
[3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:45.760]  it's a whole fraud not a whole fraud a partial fraud you know like i got lead that was the uh
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:54.480]  head of the fda yeah the god lead guy yeah scott god lead yeah arrogant little scott god
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:59.520]  lead yeah that guy yeah the one that talked about social distancing and all the things that we had
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:05.760]  to do and then backtrack the fb left the fda you know who he's with now bizer that's right
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:12.560]  it's not a revolving door it's one door man of women i gotta be equal here
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:21.040]  i mean imagine this the guy that was the head of the fda is now on the board of directors of fizer
[3:11:24.480 --> 3:11:29.600]  and by the way fizer gave biden a million bucks
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:36.480]  when he got inaugurated for the inauguration that was the maximum amount they could give
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:44.480]  it fizer so they're killing us in a lot of ways
[3:11:47.280 --> 3:11:52.160]  this is just one of them this is that from this week's trends journal

[3:12:15.760 --> 3:12:21.680]  and you got a clown like biden telling the hair salons and barbers to sell it yeah they
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:28.880]  could give a crap about these people but boy to sell the drug lords drugs that's all they are

[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:16.880]  when i realized the great effect we've had it's really counting the cost and realizing that if we
[3:14:16.880 --> 3:14:21.920]  weren't here if you hadn't supported us the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:26.800]  globalist instead a lot of really really positive things are happening and so many of the corrupt
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:31.040]  things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open and so info wars
[3:14:31.040 --> 3:14:35.760]  credibility is higher than it's ever been but the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many
[3:14:35.760 --> 3:14:40.000]  different attacks we've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air it's so expensive
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:45.360]  so please get great products and keep info wars on the air at the same time at infowarstore.com in

[3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:52.480]  week's trends journal covet bad round up weed killer good when the covet war broke out in january
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:16:00.560]  2020 we noted that hundreds of millions of people animals and living species have been and continue
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:08.320]  to be killed by the trillions of tons of pesticides insecticides and chemicals pumped into the earth
[3:16:08.320 --> 3:16:14.960]  water and air and of course the artificial ingredients preservatives added to food and soft drinks
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:23.680]  among the alleged chemicals sprayed on plants and ingested by humans is a product been
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:29.920]  by more advanced nations but allowed to be sold and used in the united states round up
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:41.360]  up they are ag leagued by over 125 000 claims that it's popular weed killer round up is carcinogenic
[3:16:41.360 --> 3:16:49.520]  and is also a people killer has lost an attempt to limit its liability in cases not yet filed
[3:16:51.840 --> 3:16:54.160]  we go on and on and on to talk about this
[3:16:54.160 --> 3:16:59.360]  is the point being is that
[3:17:02.960 --> 3:17:07.920]  they scare the hell out of the people with the covet war when they're killing us
[3:17:09.280 --> 3:17:18.480]  in how many different ways nonstop you like those artificial flavors i know you like the
[3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:27.120]  artificial colors in the food all the stuff they spray and dump into the water you worried
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:35.280]  about the covet war could you imagine if they put the concentration of the covet virus on all the
[3:17:35.280 --> 3:17:40.880]  things that the big companies are killing us with of course they would never do it
[3:17:40.880 --> 3:17:47.360]  and as alex was talking about biden before bs biden
[3:17:49.680 --> 3:17:54.320]  telling you know barbers and salon people to sell the facts
[3:17:57.680 --> 3:18:07.200]  art is dead you got a dolly parton a mick jagger or jagger off what do you want to call them
[3:18:07.200 --> 3:18:19.840]  sell in the vaccine you got lotteries in california and ohio jerry new jersey new york maryland
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:26.640]  all the companies the crispy creams and all the other ones promoting a vaccine
[3:18:28.640 --> 3:18:30.080]  this is unprecedented
[3:18:32.640 --> 3:18:36.160]  and why are they giving it to young people when the recovery rate according to the
[3:18:36.160 --> 3:18:43.200]  sentence of disease control and prevention is only 99.997 percent
[3:18:46.320 --> 3:18:55.920]  those are the facts and again lottery tickets beer free beer oh we know we we did the numbers
[3:18:55.920 --> 3:19:04.480]  almost 400 colleges when you put all the campuses together won't allow students to go back unless
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:09.760]  they got the jab yeah this is unprecedented
[3:19:15.040 --> 3:19:22.000]  and the media is playing down the protests they had a protest in london on saturday
[3:19:25.600 --> 3:19:28.480]  massive protests in london is from the trends journal this week
[3:19:28.480 --> 3:19:36.400]  the u.s. media lies about the numbers they reported this is rt reported that hundreds
[3:19:36.400 --> 3:19:41.040]  tens of thousands who were unhappy with the prolonged lockdown imposed by the government
[3:19:41.680 --> 3:19:47.440]  blah blah blah blah who were brought together under the banner unite for freedom
[3:19:50.400 --> 3:19:56.080]  anti-vaccine sediment predates the pandemic but i don't use that word pandemic anybody
[3:19:56.080 --> 3:20:01.120]  got to change that but it has picked up steam since the covet 19 appeared blah blah blah blah
[3:20:01.120 --> 3:20:09.920]  all right it goes on the protests point out the inconsistencies of the u.k. government's response
[3:20:10.960 --> 3:20:17.840]  and the people against getting a vaccination this is how the new york times reported it
[3:20:17.840 --> 3:20:32.800]  hundreds protests vaccine passport in london this is how nbc reported it
[3:20:32.800 --> 3:20:46.320]  london anti-lockdown protests draws hundreds we put the links there from the videos hundreds
[3:20:48.240 --> 3:20:49.200]  maybe a million
[3:20:52.800 --> 3:20:57.360]  you look at the videos that people they just kept marching and marching down the street
[3:20:57.360 --> 3:21:05.360]  where are the american people why aren't we doing that in they are yeah this is hundreds
[3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:14.320]  hundreds look at the lie right in front of your eyes
[3:21:14.320 --> 3:21:25.040]  look at this where are we the people of the united states
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:33.280]  and they're pushing through this passport they're pushing it through in colleges
[3:21:34.160 --> 3:21:41.920]  they're pushing it everywhere if we don't unite for freedom and that's the big news by the way
[3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:51.280]  that i announced this past weekend at our rally i'm starting a church it's all done
[3:21:52.880 --> 3:22:04.240]  put in all the papers the universal church of freedom peace and justice just us
[3:22:04.240 --> 3:22:14.080]  freedom is the big word all religions if your god believes in freedom peace and justice
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:16.640]  that's what we want to unite
[3:22:19.600 --> 3:22:23.440]  they just had a big thing over there in switzerland about
[3:22:25.440 --> 3:22:29.920]  laws that are going on in the european union that are affecting switzerland and they
[3:22:29.920 --> 3:22:35.280]  the people had a referendum back in 1991 a referendum that people decide not little
[3:22:35.280 --> 3:22:39.840]  lowlife scum politicians who get paid off at morons and imbecile school
[3:22:40.640 --> 3:22:44.880]  campaign contributions the bribes and payoffs the people voted they didn't want to join the EU
[3:22:45.760 --> 3:22:49.520]  another issue just came up they had a referendum with the EU and people said no we want no part of
[3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:55.760]  it and that's part of the universal church of freedom peace and justice we decide
[3:22:55.760 --> 3:22:58.400]  not little lowlife scum
[3:23:00.720 --> 3:23:03.680]  some old craps and repulsive kittens in a country near you
[3:23:05.360 --> 3:23:11.440]  so this is going to be a big movement that i'm pushing the universal church of freedom peace
[3:23:11.440 --> 3:23:16.320]  and justice the new site's not up yet but the occupied peace site is
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:25.760]  many new sites going to be freedom peace justice dot church or religion if your god
[3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:31.200]  believes in freedom peace and justice join on board because that's the only way i believe we
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:39.680]  could beat them look at the power of religions look how they rule hey you want to crusade

[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:32.400]  coven 19 pandemic loss touch with reality is by richard gale and gary null phd what if you
[3:28:32.400 --> 3:28:39.120]  were to know that a cabal of corporate bureaucrats and scientists at the heart of the centers for
[3:28:39.120 --> 3:28:46.560]  disease control and prevention cdc have known for almost two decades that vaccines including
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:58.080]  the m mr can lead to autism and other and other neurological disorders all of the facts right
[3:28:58.080 --> 3:29:08.480]  here this is not a conspiracy theorist another article in this week's transjournal

[3:29:16.800 --> 3:29:22.800]  and it's about an article in the new york times the meaning of meta when it comes to
[3:29:22.800 --> 3:29:28.800]  outdoor transmission they go around and around and around over here but they get to the facts
[3:29:31.200 --> 3:29:40.640]  and the fact is that according to the data which even they put in here that rachel love rachel
[3:29:40.640 --> 3:29:52.960]  levine not rachel levine uh rochelle walinsky the head of the the cdc yep full of baloney
[3:29:55.040 --> 3:30:03.200]  this is the impending doom rachel levine do you remember the cdc the new head over there

[3:30:10.800 --> 3:30:14.640]  but every body's going to be sweet the covid's going to be sweeping everywhere impending doom
[3:30:17.040 --> 3:30:22.400]  it's right here when questioned by senate committee about the risk of outdoor transmission
[3:30:22.400 --> 3:30:33.440]  cdc director rochelle impending doom walinsky stated the risk was under ten percent
[3:30:36.880 --> 3:30:38.080]  yeah it's under ten percent
[3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:46.960]  dr lawinsky defended that figure saying it came you ready from just a single study
[3:30:46.960 --> 3:30:53.360]  published in the journal of infectious disease the one study she said was a meta analysis
[3:30:54.000 --> 3:31:01.600]  of other studies with meta meaning it synthesized the data the other studies from the other studies
[3:31:01.600 --> 3:31:13.280]  to reach a conclusion but when the epidemiologist authors that study dr noxin razzani of the
[3:31:13.280 --> 3:31:19.520]  university of california san francisco learned of dr lawinsky statements she chimed in with a
[3:31:19.520 --> 3:31:30.240]  different conclusion the meta analysis cited by dr lawinsky was a systematic systemic review
[3:31:33.440 --> 3:31:41.280]  all but all but one of the studies of which it was based you ready had put the outdoor transmission
[3:31:41.280 --> 3:31:52.240]  at less than one percent less than one percent outdoor transmission and these little clowns
[3:31:54.400 --> 3:31:57.520]  now miss fatsha bruce right there right in front of you yep
