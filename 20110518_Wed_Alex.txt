[00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:09.874]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:11.455]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:12.996]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:17.198]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:21.261]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:41.633]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:46.076]  It is Wednesday, the 18th day of May, 2011.
[00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:50.879]  We're going to be live here for at least the next three hours today.
[00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.442]  Dr. Chris Busby is going to be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour.
[00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:56.863]  I don't think so.
[00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:18.071]  What happened in the mid-1980s, 1986 at Chernobyl.
[00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:29.679]  And it's not even really in the newspapers anymore, and there's no discussion about Japanese children not drinking milk from Japan, or not catching fish from the sea.
[00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.200]  Our government isn't testing any of the food coming from Japan.
[00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:41.907]  They're not testing air travelers that are coming over here after they first tested them just a week into it and found they were coming in with radiation all over them.
[00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:43.108]  It's just incredible.
[00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:50.793]  It's this new globalist policy of, well it's like 20 years ago they started having the troops use depleted uranium.
[00:01:50.793 --> 00:02:00.780]  Before that they wouldn't let troops use it because whether it's a .308 round or a round fired from an Abrams tank cannon
[00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:21.310]  It ignites in the barrel and when you open the breech, some of it comes out on you and it also fires out the front of the vehicle and then basically puts a patina of dust on the Bradley fighting vehicle, the Warrior fighting vehicle, the Abrams, the Abrams M1A, the .50 cal on top of a Humvee.
[00:02:22.982 --> 00:02:26.207]  They're using them at proving grounds at every major military base now.
[00:02:26.207 --> 00:02:27.849]  There's just zero controls.
[00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.736]  Before, it was locked up in case of just absolute nuclear war with the Russians.
[00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:38.964]  10 to 1 superiority, heavy armor rolling across into Germany.
[00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.449]  I don't know.
[00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.912]  That's the same thing now with the radiation.
[00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:10.655]  What was it, a month ago, the EPA just waved a magic wand and put the public comment period up, as if they care what we say, that they were going to raise what they say is the safe levels.
[00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:14.575]  And I really haven't covered Fukushima enough.
[00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:24.378]  It is such a big deal, and it goes to the underlying issue of the philosophy of the culture we're living in.
[00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:29.227]  There's a full breakneck move to build more reactors in the U.S.
[00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:34.950]  There's a full breakneck move to let Tokyo Electric build reactors in Texas.
[00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.591]  First they were saying it was going to be cancelled, now it's not.
[00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:45.835]  There's 36 level 4 bio-weapons labs under BioShield, under Bush, and now Obama's continuing it.
[00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:51.818]  And they go to existing facilities like the University of Texas at Galveston in a hurricane
[00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:55.126]  Ravaged area.
[00:03:55.126 --> 00:04:02.934]  I mean, Galveston routinely gets, in the last hundred years, what twice has been completely wiped off the map.
[00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:08.629]  And just a few years ago, much of it got destroyed and devastated.
[00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.371]  It was 10 feet of water over many areas of the city.
[00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:21.994]  They have a level 4 bioweapons development lab in the name of bioresearch in a level 2 containment facility just down there.
[00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:26.716]  And Galveston's right down the road from Houston, 6 plus million people, metro.
[00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.743]  I don't think so.
[00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:43.227]  It goes to the mindset of these people.
[00:04:43.227 --> 00:04:47.290]  And meanwhile they're saying we gotta stick our hands down your pants because terrorists might get you.
[00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.272]  We gotta pull baby diapers off.
[00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:57.538]  And then meanwhile every terrorist that we've had attack us since 9-11 has been funded and run by our own intelligence networks.
[00:04:57.538 --> 00:04:58.539]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.360]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.001]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:13.603]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:18.985]  Demand for food is high, but eFoodsDirect has plenty of radiation-free food to meet your needs.
[00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:24.787]  With our new triple production capacity, you will get the fastest shipments of food in the country to help you get the most food possible.
[00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:25.627]  We're good to go.
[00:05:52.353 --> 00:05:55.378]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.741]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:09.602]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.903]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.903 --> 00:06:17.766]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:24.009]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:30.413]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:34.596]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.596 --> 00:06:38.878]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:44.822]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:48.384]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:50.365]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.365 --> 00:06:50.806]  It's here.

[00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:07.299]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:12.443]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:07:12.443 --> 00:07:19.148]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:27.574]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:07:29.517 --> 00:07:34.258]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:07:34.258 --> 00:07:39.299]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:41.460]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.240]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.121]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:52.742]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:07:55.443 --> 00:07:58.684]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:03.679]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:07.052]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:31.931]  In response to the intensifying attacks by MSNBC, CBS 60 Minutes, countless other newspaper articles, just an all-out assault against a wide spectrum, a diverse spectrum of
[00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:55.182]  People that know that the federal government's out of control, that state governments are out of control, that they're breaking our Constitution and Bill of Rights every day, that the system is religiously prosecuting a full-out war against every basic liberty and freedom, and praising torture and secret arrest.
[00:08:56.275 --> 00:08:59.661]  If you criticize any of that, you're demonized.
[00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:02.666]  And we have the internal video training, we have...
[00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:16.315]  Many internal videos, we've put clips of it on the web, of them training police at anybody taking photos anywhere, even the Statue of Liberty, it's a terrorist, get their name, put them in a terror database.
[00:09:16.315 --> 00:09:22.456]  The head federal marshal in Denver a few years ago went public and said, we're ordered every day to put innocent people on databases.
[00:09:22.456 --> 00:09:25.517]  Little kid takes a photo with a camera at the airport, boom, they're in it.
[00:09:25.517 --> 00:09:29.398]  You order a special meal on the airplane, you know, ask for vegetarian, it happens.
[00:09:29.398 --> 00:09:32.779]  It's all about creating a system where we are seen as terrorists.
[00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:36.941]  And it's all illegitimate.
[00:09:36.941 --> 00:09:43.005]  And there is a wide spectrum, a continuum.
[00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:49.569]  of people awakening to what's happening and they're being demonized.
[00:09:49.569 --> 00:10:00.377]  So we have one of the founders or great granddaddies of the Sovereign Citizen Movement, Red Beckman, joining us today.
[00:10:00.377 --> 00:10:04.981]  We had Alfred Dask on yesterday, definitely going to have him back.
[00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:06.362]  Very impressive information.
[00:10:06.362 --> 00:10:09.424]  I've read his work for years, don't know why I've never had him on the show.
[00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:14.582]  I believe he's called in a few times, though, but had Alfred Adask on yesterday.
[00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:22.808]  Red Beckman is going to be joining us coming up in the next hour, and then we'll, in the last 30 minutes of the third hour, have Dr. Christopher Busby on.
[00:10:22.808 --> 00:10:26.631]  TEPCO says nuclear meltdown occurred 16 hours after earthquake.
[00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:27.892]  More on the way.
[00:10:27.892 --> 00:10:29.333]  Yeah, they got hit.
[00:10:30.524 --> 00:10:48.831]  On that Friday, and then the radiation level went way up and there was a meltdown, a partial meltdown, and then that reactor blew up Saturday morning, Reactor 1, and then on the Monday, a day and a half later, Reactor 3, that's a plutonium reactor, boxed,
[00:10:49.651 --> 00:11:16.203]  uh... mark one general electric forty-year-old design it it blew up sky-high and they're now confirming uh... that uh... there are meltdowns at five probably complete meltdowns at two to three uh... fuel rods ejected hundreds of thousands of them upwards of a mile and a half away the Japanese just buried them on site going right into the water uh... levels of radiation thousands and thousands of times safe level picked up within two weeks in the water
[00:11:17.303 --> 00:11:18.044]  I don't know.
[00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:41.565]  It's basically just in local Japanese newspapers and we've had the head engineer at the plant quit and go public.
[00:11:41.565 --> 00:11:56.337]  We've had the chief advisor to the Prime Minister and President go public and say that the deaths are being covered up and the radiation levels are being covered up and that the government shouldn't tell schools just 12 kilometers away to continue operating and have children playing outside.
[00:11:57.137 --> 00:12:00.480]  There is no checking of milk, fish, or anything in the U.S.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.540]  by the feds.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.022]  There is no attempt to even look at it.
[00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:13.148]  Many state governments, 20 plus last time I checked, in fact, I've got to continue just to research it because there's almost no news on it now.
[00:12:13.148 --> 00:12:24.977]  States came out less than a month into this, now weeks ago, and reported high levels in milk, produce, because the radiation continues to drift over and build up.
[00:12:25.902 --> 00:12:27.643]  We're now several months into this.
[00:12:43.922 --> 00:12:47.163]  Two months into it, I remember.
[00:12:47.163 --> 00:12:52.164]  March 11th, so it's now May 18th, that's over two months, so my dead reckoning's correct.
[00:12:52.164 --> 00:12:57.545]  Two plus months into this, and the fires are intensifying, the smoke is intensifying.
[00:12:57.545 --> 00:13:05.386]  Their answer, they announced last week, is to, because that's who builds the biggest tents in the world, are circus tent companies.
[00:13:05.386 --> 00:13:11.268]  They're gonna erect circus tents over it, and they say that's to keep the radiation from dispersing.
[00:13:12.768 --> 00:13:18.799]  It will keep some of the particulate from rising in the atmosphere, but it's still going to basically leak out.
[00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:23.808]  They did studies back in the 50s with plutonium and uranium with the mousetrap and the...
[00:13:24.997 --> 00:13:39.208]  The room full of mousetraps and a ping pong ball, and they throw it in with the tiny amount of uranium or plutonium, and then they do a test afterwards, and the entire room and the hundreds of mousetraps all are radioactive.
[00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:52.959]  So see, one little particle gets out, and it bumps into some seaweed that floats over, and a fish eats it, and another fish eats that fish, and then you eat it later, or a little bit of it gets on a cobweb that gets picked up by the atmosphere,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.020]  I don't
[00:14:09.742 --> 00:14:16.788]  And they pick up all, mainly spiders are in the atmosphere, and hair, and cotton particles, and potash.
[00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:18.930]  The point is that stuff's just circling the globe.
[00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:26.056]  Just from Chernobyl in 86, the northern hemisphere of the planet has double the radiation level it had previously.
[00:14:27.168 --> 00:14:30.229]  Double from just Chernobyl.
[00:14:30.229 --> 00:14:32.309]  And we get those numbers, and they tracked it.
[00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:45.472]  And in Europe, in Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, for at least six months they tested the food, and they brought the milk in, powdered from the United States and other nations that weren't in that area.
[00:14:45.472 --> 00:14:54.434]  The school children, for at least six months, ate frozen food, and they just had to basically kill the livestock.
[00:14:55.274 --> 00:14:57.115]  And let the crops lay fallow.
[00:14:57.115 --> 00:15:00.358]  There's not even a discussion about this.
[00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:10.005]  Chernobyl was the equivalent, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, of 400 Hiroshima's.
[00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:10.245]  400!
[00:15:10.245 --> 00:15:13.788]  Because a reactor meltdown is so dirty.
[00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:18.532]  And now we learn of five of the six have had partial or complete meltdowns.
[00:15:18.532 --> 00:15:26.540]  The Japanese are being very secretive, but they now admit this reactor is 70%, this one 50%, then we hear total meltdown later.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:37.791]  It was over a month ago that one of the reactors, what, three, melted completely out of the containment and boiled out and burned through the concrete floor and is just smoking.
[00:15:41.488 --> 00:15:52.620]  644,000 spent fuel rods stored at Fukushima, and it is just mind-boggling, mind-boggling, that this is not in our news anymore.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.762]  It is.
[00:15:53.762 --> 00:16:01.390]  Last Monday, not this Monday, but last Monday, there's a webcam for Japanese TV there, and it showed smoke and what looked like explosions going off at night.
[00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:04.173]  And it turned out that was true three or four days later.
[00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:05.054]  It was just a minor footnote.
[00:16:05.054 --> 00:16:06.916]  Oh, there's some more fires and explosions.
[00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:13.924]  We're going to build a tent around it, um, ostensibly to stop the radioactive particles that are reducing it.
[00:16:13.924 --> 00:16:17.808]  But, uh, guaranteed that's just so people don't look at it blowing up and smoking.
[00:16:17.808 --> 00:16:20.631]  And again, they said it might be nine months, a year, two years, five years.
[00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:24.174]  It might just, it might just be this belching thing on the,
[00:16:25.037 --> 00:16:31.182]  Northeastern coast of Japan with the trade winds blowing right into us for the foreseeable future!
[00:16:31.182 --> 00:16:41.910]  And that's why the Environmental Protection Agency has come out, and I saw some rulings by the FDA, Food Regulatory Administration as well, saying yes, we're going to follow the new guidelines.
[00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:48.515]  This isotope can be a thousand times more, and this one can be a hundred thousand more, and what?
[00:16:48.515 --> 00:16:51.457]  Because they say!
[00:16:51.457 --> 00:16:54.600]  So, out of sight out of mind, and this isn't
[00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:59.170]  This isn't the end of it.
[00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:06.755]  Okay, let me just read, we're gonna see if I can do this, never can, but let's just see if I can just read you the headlines before I come back and go into them.
[00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:21.965]  I think out of everything I've got here, this really mates up with all the police state news I covered yesterday, and Supreme Court ruling, federally, Indiana Supreme Court ruling, and the state of Indiana that there is no Fourth Amendment.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.661]  For any reason, including no reason at all, we're coming in your house.
[00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:28.462]  Remember the Patriot Act?
[00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:28.882]  What is it?
[00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.504]  Section 213?
[00:17:31.504 --> 00:17:35.145]  This is out of K-O-A-T Television.
[00:17:35.145 --> 00:17:37.006]  Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:39.227]  Delayed notice search warrants increasing.
[00:17:39.227 --> 00:17:41.528]  And there's one little line here, I'm gonna get to later.
[00:17:41.528 --> 00:17:48.651]  While billed as an anti-terror tool, a sneak and peek warrant, has no requirements on it that it preclude it from being used in standard criminal investigations.
[00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:55.228]  And they go on to say that most of them are being used in non-terror-related.
[00:17:55.228 --> 00:18:05.133]  And these are Soviet-style, where the men in black come into your house, and just in this circuit court, it's over 200 of them.
[00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:14.259]  200 of them just in this circuit court, and 2,000 of them in 2009.
[00:18:19.073 --> 00:18:19.273]  They don't
[00:18:39.884 --> 00:18:40.084]  It's
[00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:58.313]  Massive frame-ups at the FBI Crime Lab.
[00:18:58.313 --> 00:19:01.835]  I've interviewed the former head of the FBI Crime Lab, Dr. Frederick Weiders, many times.
[00:19:01.835 --> 00:19:03.416]  You can't believe anything.
[00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:06.758]  The whole justice system is discredited, is a fraud.
[00:19:06.758 --> 00:19:14.323]  And I read the articles yesterday where Tennessee, other parts of the country, cops are now pulling you over and just taking whatever money you got in your wallet.
[00:19:14.323 --> 00:19:16.124]  You got proof that cash is yours?
[00:19:16.124 --> 00:19:16.764]  Well, no.
[00:19:16.764 --> 00:19:18.225]  I mean, it's my cash.
[00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:18.946]  Well, I'm going to take it.
[00:19:19.978 --> 00:19:23.720]  And if you argue, I'm taking you to jail.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.100]  It's just highway robbery.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:25.700]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.801]  I said I'd get to all the other news.
[00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:28.862]  That's just one article.
[00:19:28.862 --> 00:19:32.763]  More raids on people selling legal fresh milk.
[00:19:32.763 --> 00:19:37.845]  It's not illegal, but see, if they have SWAT teams hit you, then they go to the juries and show a SWAT team raid.
[00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:40.286]  And the jury thinks, well, SWAT teams are raiding somebody.
[00:19:40.286 --> 00:19:41.506]  They must be guilty.
[00:19:41.506 --> 00:19:42.647]  And the jury sends them to jail.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:49.387]  Just like you can go to jail for $2 bills that are legal, you can go to jail for silver dollars.
[00:19:49.387 --> 00:19:55.872]  Because, I mean, they've got a horde of fluoride heads out there who just want to watch television and suck their thumbs.
[00:19:55.872 --> 00:20:00.075]  A bunch of lackadaisical entertainment heads begging to get gang-raped by the New World Order.
[00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:07.617]  Iodine Protection Packs from HempUSA.org are now in stock for immediate delivery worldwide.

[00:20:30.123 --> 00:20:39.449]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.449 --> 00:20:40.230]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:46.494]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.494 --> 00:20:47.375]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:50.637]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.637 --> 00:20:51.437]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.437 --> 00:20:52.518]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:20:53.158 --> 00:20:53.439]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.584 --> 00:21:07.533]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.
[00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:13.481]  18 years ago we cracked the code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts.
[00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:17.246]  It's called Zero Debt Guaranteed and it works for all debts.
[00:21:17.566 --> 00:21:19.368]  My wages were being garnished.
[00:21:19.368 --> 00:21:24.175]  So I used the program and the attorney dropped the case and he returned my money within two weeks.
[00:21:24.175 --> 00:21:28.040]  With zero debt guaranteed, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.103]  There is no other program of its kind.
[00:21:30.103 --> 00:21:32.305]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.881]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.881 --> 00:22:17.427]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[00:22:17.427 --> 00:22:17.768]  dollar.
[00:22:17.768 --> 00:22:23.210]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide
[00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:28.674]  A free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy and inflation.
[00:22:28.674 --> 00:22:38.783]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[00:22:38.783 --> 00:22:44.367]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[00:22:45.168 --> 00:22:54.656]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[00:22:54.656 --> 00:22:59.900]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.402]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[00:23:02.402 --> 00:23:04.464]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:13.174]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[00:23:56.426 --> 00:24:09.956]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:34.150]  Again, it is not rocket science that things have completely changed.
[00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.593]  The general public is disconnected from reality.
[00:24:38.593 --> 00:24:41.615]  Up at the Drudge Report, they've got a link to a Daily Mail
[00:24:42.742 --> 00:25:11.130]  article that's got late 30s early 40s depression color photos and You look at how grounded and focused these people are because as Victor Hugo says adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters and You look into the eyes of this little black kid These families, you know living outdoors getting some food
[00:25:12.899 --> 00:25:18.781]  A little kids fishing for their dinner in Shriver, Louisiana.
[00:25:18.781 --> 00:25:23.483]  It looks like something out of the 1800s.
[00:25:23.483 --> 00:25:30.525]  Just amazing color photos of these really hard-working people and what they were going through.
[00:25:33.737 --> 00:25:36.579]  Then after the war, we had this huge industrial base.
[00:25:36.579 --> 00:25:39.782]  People got wealth that they'd never imagined.
[00:25:39.782 --> 00:25:41.683]  And they said, man, this government's great.
[00:25:41.683 --> 00:25:44.025]  We can trust whatever they say.
[00:25:44.025 --> 00:25:51.611]  And so America went completely to sleep and forgot how this country was founded, how this country was built up.
[00:25:51.611 --> 00:25:59.337]  And this country was extremely wealthy and had a 10% on average growth rate economically from its founding right through to 1913.
[00:26:02.054 --> 00:26:19.604]  And then the private Federal Reserve immediately set up a banking panic and put out a lot of hot money into the public and then restricted that money and imploded the economy and had one of the greatest wealth transfers in history.
[00:26:19.604 --> 00:26:30.371]  And then they came back after World War II and basically reactivated the economy that had been built up during World War II and people basically gave up the
[00:26:34.386 --> 00:26:46.469]  Basic bedrock code that is liberty, that is freedom, that made the United States the apple of the world's eye.
[00:26:46.469 --> 00:26:48.270]  The country where you had real property rights.
[00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.271]  The country where you could be armed to protect yourself from thugs and government.
[00:26:52.271 --> 00:27:00.093]  A country where you had true free speech and a policeman wouldn't dare think to come to you on a soapbox on a street corner and tell you you had to have a permit.
[00:27:01.727 --> 00:27:06.008]  A country where the police wouldn't dare break in your house and plant things on you.
[00:27:06.008 --> 00:27:10.009]  A country where the police wouldn't dare come in your house without a warrant.
[00:27:10.009 --> 00:27:17.170]  A country where the police wouldn't dare ask for an ID, much less stick their hands down your pants.
[00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:22.071]  All right, we're gonna go to break in the next long segment, get into all this news, but here's the headlines.
[00:27:22.071 --> 00:27:25.611]  Warrants let agents enter homes without owner knowing.
[00:27:25.611 --> 00:27:27.992]  Delayed notice search warrants increasing.
[00:27:29.017 --> 00:27:30.758]  Uh, no kidding.
[00:27:30.758 --> 00:27:33.239]  Ron Paul, the milk police.
[00:27:33.239 --> 00:27:35.260]  Breaks it down.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.281]  Here's another report by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:27:37.281 --> 00:27:40.882]  Is criminal behavior a prerequisite to get a job with the TSA?
[00:27:40.882 --> 00:27:44.864]  Just more robberies, more sexual molestation by these people.
[00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:47.465]  Who do you think wants that type of job?
[00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:50.346]  An excellent article at LewRockwell.com by Jack D. Douglas.
[00:27:50.346 --> 00:27:52.987]  How totalitarian police states are built.
[00:27:52.987 --> 00:27:54.228]  And I want to try to go over some of.
[00:27:57.415 --> 00:28:01.217]  So that's just some of the news we're going to cover on that front with the TEPCO situation.
[00:28:01.217 --> 00:28:02.718]  I've already talked about that quite a bit.
[00:28:02.718 --> 00:28:06.260]  The TEPCO nuclear meltdown occurred 16 hours after earthquake.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.521]  More on the way.
[00:28:07.521 --> 00:28:11.443]  And they knew the whole time and were lying because they knew it had a lot of attention on it then.
[00:28:11.443 --> 00:28:19.128]  If they just lied about it at the time, then it could come out later because people would be moving on to the next big issue.
[00:28:20.762 --> 00:28:21.363]  Here's another one.
[00:28:21.363 --> 00:28:24.045]  Fukushima reactors a raging nuclear inferno.
[00:28:24.045 --> 00:28:25.026]  Curt Nemo.
[00:28:25.026 --> 00:28:28.629]  But he's got links to all the Japanese press releases.
[00:28:28.629 --> 00:28:30.190]  Alright, continuing.
[00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:31.752]  Here's the big news.
[00:28:31.752 --> 00:28:34.955]  Pakistan-China premieres meet amid tension with the U.S.
[00:28:36.547 --> 00:28:39.728]  Of course, General Hamid Gul told you that was coming up yesterday.
[00:28:39.728 --> 00:28:42.790]  They are openly running to China and Russia.
[00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.771]  Pakistan has not been friends with China and Russia.
[00:28:45.771 --> 00:28:48.692]  They do not like communist folks.
[00:28:48.692 --> 00:28:51.653]  And have traditionally been our ally.
[00:28:51.653 --> 00:28:54.315]  And, of course, the US has got drones bombing everywhere.
[00:28:54.315 --> 00:28:56.335]  They've asked the US to stop it.
[00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:57.056]  Our government won't.
[00:28:57.896 --> 00:28:58.116]  That is
[00:29:13.407 --> 00:29:14.707]  Please help us.
[00:29:14.707 --> 00:29:18.308]  And Pakistan's saying, if you fly aircraft in here, we're going to open fire on them.
[00:29:18.308 --> 00:29:21.769]  And the U.S., people running our country, say they're going to continue it.
[00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:25.270]  So they're trying to start World War III, because these people have nukes.
[00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.651]  We've got that report.
[00:29:26.651 --> 00:29:27.811]  A bunch of political news.
[00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:29.271]  The Newt Gingrich controversy.
[00:29:29.271 --> 00:29:30.932]  It's not a controversy.
[00:29:30.932 --> 00:29:37.413]  Newt Gingrich is as conservative as... I don't know.
[00:29:37.413 --> 00:29:38.814]  Think of the most... Al Gore.
[00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:41.471]  I mean, he basically is Al Gore.
[00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:44.294]  He actually supports almost every policy Al Gore does.
[00:29:44.294 --> 00:29:47.338]  Willie Nelson endorses Johnson.
[00:29:47.338 --> 00:29:47.959]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.959 --> 00:29:50.922]  I got a lot of other news.
[00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:52.324]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:54.847]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.847 --> 00:29:57.530]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.438 --> 00:30:04.981]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.981 --> 00:30:05.901]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.901 --> 00:30:09.324]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.324 --> 00:30:10.184]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.184 --> 00:30:15.087]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.087 --> 00:30:15.828]  It's true.
[00:30:15.828 --> 00:30:20.691]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.691 --> 00:30:21.531]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.531 --> 00:30:25.114]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:28.796]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.016 --> 00:30:29.796]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.796 --> 00:30:32.558]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.558 --> 00:30:36.239]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.239 --> 00:30:37.039]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:41.181]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.181 --> 00:30:46.223]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.223 --> 00:30:50.405]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.405 --> 00:30:52.206]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.206 --> 00:30:56.788]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:59.170]  877-327-0365.
[00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:03.094]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:08.399]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:09.940]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:18.729]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:19.449 --> 00:31:26.991]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:26.991 --> 00:31:34.992]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:34.992 --> 00:31:40.213]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:31:40.213 --> 00:31:42.373]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:31:50.746 --> 00:31:52.890]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:32:01.235 --> 00:32:05.259]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:08.502]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.502 --> 00:32:13.306]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:19.692]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.692 --> 00:32:21.935]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.475 --> 00:32:22.775]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:23.295]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.295 --> 00:32:24.076]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:25.236]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:27.478]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.365 --> 00:32:48.648]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:48.648 --> 00:32:57.833]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:08.917 --> 00:33:15.704]  You guys don't realize that Eternal Fate has turned us back on here.
[00:33:15.704 --> 00:33:17.346]  It's 2am here.
[00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:21.470]  It's 2am and the fear is gone.
[00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.331]  It's 2am.
[00:33:22.331 --> 00:33:24.353]  The sun is still warm.
[00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:43.687]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:43.687 --> 00:33:44.348]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:44.348 --> 00:33:46.410]  we are here live.
[00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.733]  We're going to be getting Dr. Steve Pachinik back on in the next few days.
[00:33:51.361 --> 00:34:08.807]  He called me a few days ago, left a message talking about a Wall Street Journal article where they admit that the Al-Qaeda operatives are being basically put into place in Libya and are being protected and taken off the terrorist list.
[00:34:08.807 --> 00:34:10.647]  So that's some of the issues he wants to talk about.
[00:34:10.647 --> 00:34:14.949]  And when we get him on, we'll also put to him some of the questions that Joel Skousen brought up.
[00:34:15.809 --> 00:34:23.035]  I also want to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on a little bit later in the week because he's got articles up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:23.035 --> 00:34:28.660]  The Strauss-Kahn frame-up and the American police state strides forward.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:38.209]  And he makes some interesting points about the fact that normally globalist Bill Clinton and others are allowed to get away with whatever they want, Al Gore.
[00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:39.390]  Why is this happening now?
[00:34:40.743 --> 00:34:44.366]  Is this an orchestrated event, kind of like what we saw with WikiLeaks?
[00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:55.314]  Again, I'm no fan of Dominic Strauss-Kahn, but 60% of the French international poll think it's a setup, and people that know him say that he'll hit on women.
[00:34:55.314 --> 00:35:03.020]  Prominent members of the government and private circles say that Kahn will hit on women, but that he doesn't try to rape them.
[00:35:06.653 --> 00:35:12.919]  It's very interesting that he was about 10 points ahead of Nicolas Sarkozy, who's not even French, by the way.
[00:35:12.919 --> 00:35:15.281]  Sarkozy's not even born in France.
[00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:16.342]  You gotta love it.
[00:35:16.342 --> 00:35:19.265]  I mean, what is it with foreigners ruling on people's countries?
[00:35:19.265 --> 00:35:21.167]  I don't go to France and try to run things.
[00:35:21.167 --> 00:35:25.852]  Why do I have Schwarzenegger over here running around as the governor formerly and now wanting to be president?
[00:35:25.852 --> 00:35:26.933]  I mean, look.
[00:35:28.754 --> 00:35:44.205]  I'm sorry, I'm now digressing, but we're going to work on that and we do have Red Beckman coming up here in about 26 minutes from now and Dr. Christopher Busby in the last 30 minutes of the third hour to go over the incredible information coming out at Fukushima.
[00:35:44.205 --> 00:35:56.834]  This thing is now no doubt many times worse than Chernobyl and there's no mitigation even being tried to keep people away from fish, milk,
[00:35:58.007 --> 00:36:03.270]  And things like spinach and lettuce that really build up these radioactive isotopes.
[00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.171]  There's not even testing being done.
[00:36:05.171 --> 00:36:06.692]  At the federal level, that's their job.
[00:36:06.692 --> 00:36:08.293]  Well, it's the job they've usurped.
[00:36:08.293 --> 00:36:10.114]  It really is the state's jobs.
[00:36:10.114 --> 00:36:19.460]  And they are trying to do their jobs, but the feds control the purse strings and have been out there trying to suppress universities and others from releasing the data.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:23.182]  This is a huge cover-up that's going on and very, very upsetting.
[00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.638]  And it's the same with genetic engineering.
[00:36:27.638 --> 00:36:33.004]  It's the same with frequency pollution.
[00:36:33.004 --> 00:36:45.618]  The conscious decision has been made to basically trash the planet by the very people who are always telling us give up our rights and liberties and our private property and our labor and that every facet
[00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:56.131]  Of industry, light bulbs, toilets, homes, cars, has to be regulated by them and only their buddies can get the contracts.
[00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:56.871]  That's what it's about.
[00:36:56.871 --> 00:37:02.953]  It's about a planned economy where the insiders are the only ones that are allowed to operate.
[00:37:02.953 --> 00:37:13.116]  And then they just try to make us feel guilty and beat us into submission with the common sense overall veneer that our environment's got some problems and we need to take care of it.
[00:37:14.582 --> 00:37:34.997]  But then you've got all these top liberal environmentalists, they're not even liberal, call themselves liberal, like Mambyat, the big one-world government promoter over in England, the big rock star guy of the so-called left, saying he now firmly believes in nuclear power and that Fukushima's great!
[00:37:34.997 --> 00:37:40.921]  And as Dr. Busby has pointed out here on this show, and he's in those top circles in Europe,
[00:37:43.146 --> 00:37:44.969]  And knows Mombiot.
[00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:52.560]  Bottom line, it's more and more, Busby has to say, as he said here months ago, this is about population reduction.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.265]  Nothing tries fertility like radiation.
[00:37:56.265 --> 00:37:57.547]  Fluoride's a close second.
[00:37:59.025 --> 00:38:04.706]  And you notice they'll spend millions of dollars in lobbying to even get a small town to put it in.
[00:38:04.706 --> 00:38:07.787]  And then they write all these books about how they're doing it to us with the fluoride.
[00:38:07.787 --> 00:38:14.469]  I mean, that's what's frustrating is we're not theorizing about most of these issues.
[00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:20.690]  You know, looking at what they're doing and then trying to understand why they're doing it.
[00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:25.352]  We're looking at what they're doing and they tell us in white papers what they're doing.
[00:38:25.352 --> 00:38:26.552]  And it's just out in the open.
[00:38:28.151 --> 00:38:42.320]  I mean, when I read the Patriot Act and wrote the analysis that won the Project Censored Award in 2003, and they flew me out to California and I was at their big awards dinner.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.962]  It was on free speech television.
[00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:50.368]  That was a big deal for us at the time because we probably only reached half a million people a day.
[00:38:50.368 --> 00:38:56.291]  They had a group of lawyers and others go over my analysis of it and they said, we can't believe you've written an analysis this good.
[00:38:56.291 --> 00:39:03.974]  And then that became the template of a lot of constitutional law scholars and others to just look at the Patriot Act.
[00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:05.655]  And all I did was look at
[00:39:06.852 --> 00:39:10.635]  Where they would point out that, well, to find out what this means, you've got to go to the U.S.
[00:39:10.635 --> 00:39:11.375]  Code.
[00:39:11.375 --> 00:39:13.657]  We're changing this word and adding that word.
[00:39:13.657 --> 00:39:27.347]  And it said in plain English, for any misdemeanor, you can be locked up and the key thrown away and no lawyer and we can break in your house and we can do whatever we want.
[00:39:27.347 --> 00:39:29.749]  And it was all there in the act.
[00:39:32.448 --> 00:39:36.931]  The point is all these law scholars and people didn't go read the bill.
[00:39:36.931 --> 00:39:38.492]  It was only two hundred and something pages.
[00:39:38.492 --> 00:39:38.872]  I did.
[00:39:38.872 --> 00:39:41.194]  I went and read the bill.
[00:39:41.194 --> 00:39:45.737]  I spent three days writing the analysis of the Patriot Act.
[00:39:45.737 --> 00:39:49.519]  And the point is it's I can't do all of this.
[00:39:49.519 --> 00:39:59.606]  And then newspapers wrote articles saying Alex Jones, conspiracy theorist, claims that the Patriot Act is for the American people and not terrorists.
[00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:00.467]  And here it is.
[00:40:01.809 --> 00:40:14.637]  Today, out of KOAT television, News 7 in Albuquerque, delayed notice search warrants increasing, warrants let agents enter homes without owner knowing.
[00:40:14.637 --> 00:40:22.862]  A special type of government search warrant that allows authorities, not servants, authorities, see how they, to search homes without informing the owner for months.
[00:40:23.933 --> 00:40:29.195]  Well, yeah, and then there's another section saying you then can't tell anyone they broke in your home.
[00:40:29.195 --> 00:40:35.216]  Kind of like when they went to Borders Books and wanted all their list of what folks were reading.
[00:40:35.216 --> 00:40:40.498]  And then they told Borders Books, you will not tell anyone or we'll charge you with terrorism.
[00:40:40.498 --> 00:40:41.398]  That's a subsection.
[00:40:41.398 --> 00:40:45.399]  You can go read it in Alex Jones' analysis of Patriot Act 1.
[00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:46.840]  There's my analysis of Patriot Act 2.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:56.442]  But continuing here, I imagine someone walking through your neighborhood, coming into your home and rifling through your intimate belongings.
[00:40:56.442 --> 00:41:03.904]  They search through your home, your dresser drawers, your computer files, Peter Simpson or Simonson with the ACLU New Mexico said.
[00:41:03.904 --> 00:41:08.125]  These search warrants don't involve knocking on doors or any type of warning at all.
[00:41:08.125 --> 00:41:16.587]  Delayed notice search warrants or sneak and peek warrants allow federal agents to enter your home without telling you they've been there until months later.
[00:41:17.367 --> 00:41:22.511]  And this article doesn't add then that they tell you under federal law you can't tell folks they were there.
[00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:29.596]  The warrants have always been around, but their use has spiked since the revamped Patriot Act in 2005.
[00:41:29.596 --> 00:41:31.217]  That's not even right.
[00:41:31.217 --> 00:41:34.839]  They've not always been around.
[00:41:34.839 --> 00:41:36.400]  They're around since the October...
[00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:41.815]  Passage of the Patriot Act in 2001.
[00:41:41.815 --> 00:41:44.278]  And yes, they had Patriot Act II expanded it.
[00:41:44.278 --> 00:41:47.080]  I mean, these people can't even get this stuff right.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:52.045]  The number of delayed notice search warrants spiked nationally from around 700 in fiscal year 2007 to close to 2,000 in 2009.
[00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:04.512]  Upwards of 200 approved during the same three-year stretch came out of the Tenth Circuit Court, which covers a handful of states, including New Mexico.
[00:42:04.512 --> 00:42:08.594]  The majority of those delayed search warrants weren't even for terrorism-related cases.
[00:42:08.594 --> 00:42:09.734]  They got that right.
[00:42:09.734 --> 00:42:10.414]  According to U.S.
[00:42:10.414 --> 00:42:14.455]  Department of Justice figures, the majority of warrants are for drug cases.
[00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:22.103]  Through policy they're listing family violence, marijuana as terror.
[00:42:22.103 --> 00:42:27.308]  So even a lot of the things they list as terror aren't terror.
[00:42:27.308 --> 00:42:29.991]  Continues, the warrants are so secret the New Mexico U.S.
[00:42:29.991 --> 00:42:34.334]  Attorney General's Office wouldn't go on record with Target 7 about them.
[00:42:34.334 --> 00:42:42.141]  The ACLU said it expects delayed notice warrants numbers to keep growing each year as long as certain parts of the Patriot Act remain on the books.
[00:42:42.882 --> 00:42:48.286]  Yeah, and this itself is a whitewash, but I'm glad it's in the news.
[00:42:48.286 --> 00:42:51.168]  If you simply type in
[00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:59.269]  State uses Patriot Act in non-terror related cases, and then put the name of your state in.
[00:42:59.269 --> 00:43:01.710]  It's usually the same boilerplate article.
[00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:10.655]  You'll see, we used it 10,000 times in Alabama, whatever thousand times in Tennessee, how many times in New York.
[00:43:10.655 --> 00:43:17.799]  Type in Patriot Act used in marijuana growing case, and you'll see this where they just don't even follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:43:21.513 --> 00:43:26.977]  The first Patriot Act totally gutted six of the first ten amendments.
[00:43:26.977 --> 00:43:37.325]  And I go from memory from my second analysis that's been seconded by a lot of other major constitutional law scholars, all ten of them just completely gone.
[00:43:37.325 --> 00:43:47.694]  You could say that the tenth is inapplicable because it deals with states, but what do you think the threat fusion centers are and the quiet federalization of police?
[00:43:49.238 --> 00:43:53.839]  See, everything is about labeling and scripting.
[00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:56.520]  And I'm not going to read part of this article just because it deals with the milk.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.660]  We've already covered that.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:09.163]  I want to read part of this because it deals with how the feds operate, the more I study them.
[00:44:09.163 --> 00:44:14.804]  And then once you realize this, you're like, wow, that was always pretty obvious.
[00:44:14.804 --> 00:44:18.725]  Well, most great truths are as plain as the nose on your face or my face.
[00:44:21.271 --> 00:44:42.908]  But when we come face to face, pun intended, with this naked of corruption, this nakedness of abuse, this conscious, systematic, endemic, system-wide prerequisite of corruption.
[00:44:42.908 --> 00:44:47.652]  Corruption isn't something they tolerate and it's growing, it is the standard.
[00:44:48.729 --> 00:44:48.969]  I think?
[00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:12.181]  Why do they come in with guns drawn and slam people on the ground for no reason?
[00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:14.783]  You've seen the surveillance tapes on the news.
[00:45:14.783 --> 00:45:21.247]  Why do they have a year-long, half-million-dollar investigation of an Amish guy publicly selling legal milk?
[00:45:23.735 --> 00:45:24.876]  Why do they do all this?
[00:45:24.876 --> 00:45:27.017]  They do it as part of theater.
[00:45:27.017 --> 00:45:29.258]  That's how they fool these juries.
[00:45:29.258 --> 00:45:35.482]  Well, the federal juries are kept criminals, on average, who just stay on the jury and would do whatever they're told.
[00:45:35.482 --> 00:45:37.783]  That's why they have 98% conviction rates.
[00:45:37.783 --> 00:45:40.545]  I mean, again, 98% of folks aren't guilty, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:42.182 --> 00:45:49.826]  The old saying, better than 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man, you know, go to prison.
[00:45:49.826 --> 00:45:54.688]  And now DNA's showing what, around a third of people on death rows, turns out, are completely innocent.
[00:45:54.688 --> 00:45:59.971]  And witnesses later come out, or they catch somebody with the body buried in their basement a decade later, and it's 100%.
[00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:04.233]  And still the states will fight to keep them in jail.
[00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:05.393]  I've seen that in Texas.
[00:46:05.393 --> 00:46:06.714]  Yeah, you're 100% innocent.
[00:46:06.714 --> 00:46:08.895]  We're going to try to keep you on death row.
[00:46:11.366 --> 00:46:14.949]  I mean, these are, because they can't ever let you get an inch on them.
[00:46:14.949 --> 00:46:20.835]  They've got to keep pushing and bending and twisting everything and normalizing it.
[00:46:20.835 --> 00:46:24.298]  But imagine all the crime going on.
[00:46:24.298 --> 00:46:33.787]  11 years, full dossiers from inside Madoff's organization, people that had worked with him, of how the fraud was working, 100 plus billion in fraud, and the SEC would do nothing.
[00:46:34.793 --> 00:46:41.580]  In fact, there's evidence that they were warning people on the inside and then folks that were blowing the whistle were getting persecuted.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.004]  It was multiple high-powered folks that blew the whistle.
[00:46:45.004 --> 00:46:45.384]  11 years!
[00:46:45.384 --> 00:46:50.449]  Of course, the system is there to guard the high-level criminals.
[00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:55.174]  But look at this article on Ron Paul that Ron Paul wrote.
[00:46:55.174 --> 00:46:56.416]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:46:57.887 --> 00:47:14.328]  Ron Paul the milk police and I won't read the whole thing but on April 20th after a year-long undercover sting operation again he publicly was selling it for years publicly selling it to private customers totally legal people go driving for miles around to get it and they had a sting
[00:47:17.208 --> 00:47:34.256]  And they do the sting so they can go to the jury and talk about a sting and a SWAT team raid and phrase it so the dumb domesticated jury, but this is a federal jury so they won't need that, will think it's illegal.
[00:47:34.256 --> 00:47:40.139]  And then they'll narrowly interpret some interstate commerce clause to fool the jury.
[00:47:40.139 --> 00:47:43.761]  Just like they used counterfeiting clause to convict Von Nothouse.
[00:47:47.827 --> 00:47:57.818]  They just went in and said, you know, issuing a script that is in the likeness and meant to deceive, and then clearly that's not what it was.
[00:47:57.818 --> 00:47:58.579]  But see, they don't care.
[00:47:59.744 --> 00:48:14.167]  On April 20th, after a year-long undercover sting operation, armed federal agents acting on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration raided the business of Pennsylvania Amish farmer David, uh, or Dan... See, I try to hurry and then I start babbling.
[00:48:14.167 --> 00:48:15.628]  I need to take my time.
[00:48:15.628 --> 00:48:26.070]  On April 20th, after a year-long undercover sting operation, armed federal agents acting on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration raided the business of Pennsylvania Amish farmer Dan
[00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:41.503]  A-L-L-G-Y-E-R, Algier, to prevent him from selling his unpasteurized milk to willing, fully informed customers in Maryland.
[00:48:41.503 --> 00:48:53.933]  Federal agents wasted a whole year, and who knows how many of our tax dollars, posing as customers in order to catch the Amish farmer committing the quote, crime, that's in quotes, of selling his milk.
[00:48:56.331 --> 00:48:57.734]  Not tricking people into buying it.
[00:48:57.734 --> 00:48:59.878]  He was not forcing people to purchase it.
[00:48:59.878 --> 00:49:01.781]  And there had been no complaints about his product.
[00:49:01.781 --> 00:49:02.523]  See, no problems.
[00:49:02.523 --> 00:49:06.730]  No victim.
[00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:08.774]  These were completely voluntary transactions.
[00:49:10.029 --> 00:49:14.593]  But one that our nanny state federal government did not approve of, and so they shut down his business.
[00:49:14.593 --> 00:49:19.637]  The arrogance of the FDA and so many other federal agencies is simply appalling.
[00:49:19.637 --> 00:49:27.483]  These types of police state raids on peaceful businessmen, so reminiscent of our tyrannical federal drug war, have no place in free society.
[00:49:27.483 --> 00:49:29.665]  And he goes on.
[00:49:29.665 --> 00:49:33.188]  But see, Ron Paul's going from the position that this was wasteful and stupid.
[00:49:33.188 --> 00:49:35.389]  It's not stupid at all!
[00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:36.630]  This makes complete sense.
[00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:37.891]  If you go back into the fifties,
[00:49:38.735 --> 00:49:48.967]  Big Agra went in on record, and I've had historical guests on who've written books on the subject, and I've talked to old dairy farmers who witnessed it.
[00:49:48.967 --> 00:49:54.253]  Big Agra business wanted to be able to sell tainted milk.
[00:49:55.236 --> 00:50:17.005]  Because before, if you gave a cow too much growth hormone, or worked on it too much, or gave it other drugs, its udders would swell up, it would produce twice as much milk, but it would have blood in it, pus in it, the cows kick a lot of manure into it, and a real dairy farm, if that happened,
[00:50:17.845 --> 00:50:23.892]  You just had to dump out the entire milk and start over.
[00:50:23.892 --> 00:50:26.415]  Well, big agribusiness didn't want to do that.
[00:50:26.415 --> 00:50:30.900]  And they also wanted to be able to bring in new regulations that would shut down the smaller dairies.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.063]  And of course, the old milk wasn't pasteurized and was delivered fresh to your door.
[00:50:35.051 --> 00:50:35.291]  I think?
[00:50:56.277 --> 00:51:00.800]  But also how they put on these events to act like you're doing something criminal when you're not.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:06.022]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:05.499 --> 00:52:06.079]  The U.S.
[00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:13.365]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:52:13.365 --> 00:52:16.087]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:52:16.087 --> 00:52:19.409]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[00:52:19.409 --> 00:52:26.054]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:52:26.054 --> 00:52:28.716]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:52:28.716 --> 00:52:29.157]  Treasuries.
[00:52:29.557 --> 00:52:33.080]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:39.025]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.

[00:54:13.132 --> 00:54:22.839]  So, there's a lot of things going on here and, you know, Ron Paul goes with the angle that it's wasteful, it's stupid to spend a year doing all this undercover stuff.
[00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:28.664]  For an Amish guy's dairy, people pulled right up to and privately bought milk from him.
[00:54:28.664 --> 00:54:34.388]  Here in Austin, there are a whole bunch of little private dairies where you pull right up and buy it privately.
[00:54:34.388 --> 00:54:35.248]  It's a private sale.
[00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:43.586]  And to not have the regulators harass them, there's no law, but to not have the regulators harass them, you sign up to be part of the private club.
[00:54:44.605 --> 00:54:58.858]  Just like you can, in towns that are dry, I remember growing up in Rockwall, Texas when it was still dry, and we'd go to the Mexican food restaurant, El Chico, on Sundays, sometimes after church, and rarely did my dad want a beer.
[00:54:58.858 --> 00:55:04.864]  Not a big drinker, but sometimes he would want a beer, and they would say, man, we see your card.
[00:55:04.864 --> 00:55:08.608]  And he'd pull out his little club card to be able to get a beer.
[00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:12.523]  And so that's an example of the club card.
[00:55:12.523 --> 00:55:18.387]  You have a club card to be engaged in private commerce with someone.
[00:55:18.387 --> 00:55:20.069]  That way you're not a commercial outfit.
[00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:32.778]  And what they did in the 50s and then in the 60s is they got regulations in place that for general distribution and sale and transported across state lines, you've got to have the milk homogenized.
[00:55:32.778 --> 00:55:36.821]  And they take it and they boil it and they heat it up and it kills all of the
[00:55:39.705 --> 00:55:41.226]  We're good to go.
[00:56:03.888 --> 00:56:04.669]  Did it.
[00:56:04.669 --> 00:56:07.353]  So you wouldn't get those healthy things.
[00:56:07.353 --> 00:56:09.676]  That's the byproduct on the surface.
[00:56:09.676 --> 00:56:15.223]  It's that they could they big agribusiness want to be able to ship milk a thousand miles.
[00:56:15.223 --> 00:56:18.127]  They wanted the stuff to last for two weeks on the shelf.
[00:56:18.948 --> 00:56:21.971]  Before, people knew dairies that had the freshest milk.
[00:56:21.971 --> 00:56:23.132]  It was extremely rare.
[00:56:23.132 --> 00:56:26.195]  I've seen the statistics for any type of problems for milk.
[00:56:26.195 --> 00:56:29.317]  If it did have a problem, it wouldn't smell right or taste right.
[00:56:29.317 --> 00:56:32.200]  It was delivered fresh from the dairy in a matter of hours.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:38.246]  That's why you had milkmen at first with horses and carriages and then with little trucks because it was fresh milk.
[00:56:38.886 --> 00:56:42.269]  And Big Agra said, well, we're being killed by all the local dairies.
[00:56:42.269 --> 00:56:44.770]  They've got dairies in every town.
[00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:45.851]  It's a big business.
[00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:48.133]  How do we come in and knock out all these local dairies?
[00:56:48.133 --> 00:56:51.455]  Well, we get laws passed where they can't have fresh milk.
[00:56:51.455 --> 00:56:56.919]  It's got to be boiled, heated up, and that way we can knock them out.
[00:56:56.919 --> 00:56:58.280]  And it's the same thing now.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.302]  Six years ago, they passed a federal regulation allowing them to spray.
[00:57:01.302 --> 00:57:06.286]  You can just type in the search engine, bacteria-eating viruses sprayed on meat.
[00:57:07.186 --> 00:57:20.113]  And when it's covered in feces and blood and rotten, horrible conditions, most of the meat you eat, they just spray it with viruses that are a vaccine, a live vaccine, stewed up in big tanks to kill it, to eat the bacteria.
[00:57:20.113 --> 00:57:23.015]  But you still have the toxins from the bacteria.
[00:57:23.015 --> 00:57:26.377]  So it causes brain damage and a lot of other things.
[00:57:26.377 --> 00:57:31.539]  They then do other things like, of course, radiating.
[00:57:31.539 --> 00:57:35.922]  And most of the lunch meats and things you get now, and they don't have to even tell you, are radiated.
[00:57:37.017 --> 00:57:44.923]  And it destroys most of the food value, but the main reason is it allows them to sell stuff that is rotten.
[00:57:44.923 --> 00:57:46.323]  It kills the bacteria.
[00:57:46.323 --> 00:57:53.929]  See, before they had to throw that stuff out, or put it in dog food, and then of course that causes all the problems in pets.
[00:57:53.929 --> 00:57:57.911]  So, it's a way for big agribusiness to get away with murder.
[00:57:57.911 --> 00:57:59.793]  It's a way for them to shut down their competition.
[00:58:00.563 --> 00:58:10.352]  And that's why they spent tens of millions of dollars in one week alone last year trying to lobby, was it 17 million or 14 million, I forget now, to get the food safety bill passed.
[00:58:10.352 --> 00:58:23.224]  Big Agra has food safety disasters and then they turn around and say we'll pass a food safety bill written by them to shut down farms and ranches, small ones, that if you look at the numbers have the safest and cleanest food.
[00:58:24.485 --> 00:58:32.311]  Meanwhile, the big industrial capacity outfits, they are exempt from the new Food Safety Act that they lobbied to get put in.
[00:58:32.311 --> 00:58:37.295]  Just like Obama's friends are exempt from having to get health care for their employees, but everybody else is.
[00:58:37.295 --> 00:58:44.321]  So, that's what they're doing here.
[00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:48.264]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.623 --> 00:58:53.606]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.

[01:00:13.253 --> 01:00:17.456]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.456 --> 01:00:26.844]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.844 --> 01:00:29.626]  Founder of the fully informed jury movement,
[01:00:30.854 --> 01:00:50.268]  And one of the men who traveled the country proving that the amendment to give us the income tax was never ratified, Red Beckman, co-author of the law that never was, is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment in light of the big push by the corporate globalist disinformation outfits, the brainwashing command centers known as mainstream media.
[01:00:51.349 --> 01:01:01.891]  In light of all their demonization of the sovereign citizen movement, and that's basically anybody with an American flag hanging on their car, gets lumped in with the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:06.592]  We've got him coming on with us in the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:01:06.592 --> 01:01:12.494]  We've got Dr. Chris Busby coming on about the incredible developments going on at Fukushima.
[01:01:17.475 --> 01:01:27.541]  Was getting into this whole raw milk situation and how they do these big year long investigations and they've got to do that to act like the Amish man legally and lawfully selling milk.
[01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:36.893]  Has done something bad so that the jury sees the year investigation and so they can put on this whole theatrical event like it's illegal.
[01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:49.919]  Then they can misconstrue some federal regulation and throw them behind bars to shut down competition to Big Agra that lobbies hundreds of millions of dollars a year total into the coffers of the politicians.
[01:01:49.919 --> 01:01:56.842]  And so that's why all over the country, I know up until about a year ago, you go to the farmers market in Austin and go right over.
[01:01:57.831 --> 01:02:04.938]  And, uh, buy milk that was, uh, you know, uh, milked out of a cow at 4 a.m.
[01:02:04.938 --> 01:02:05.899]  and then at 10 a.m.
[01:02:05.899 --> 01:02:07.581]  was delivered to the farmer's market.
[01:02:07.581 --> 01:02:08.782]  Best stuff you ever tasted.
[01:02:08.782 --> 01:02:10.604]  It's real milk.
[01:02:10.604 --> 01:02:16.851]  Uh, but then they had undercovers buying it and acting creepy and threats were being made.
[01:02:16.851 --> 01:02:17.992]  So then you couldn't get it anymore.
[01:02:17.992 --> 01:02:18.893]  And, uh,
[01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.612]  They just take normal behavior.
[01:02:23.612 --> 01:02:30.477]  Just like all over the country, if you try to protest peacefully, they'll try to come over and tell you they're gonna arrest you if you don't leave, you gotta have a permit.
[01:02:30.477 --> 01:02:38.684]  And you'll be in a town like Austin where the city's lost lawsuits, the state police have lost lawsuits in Austin for arresting people, saying they gotta have a permit to protest.
[01:02:38.684 --> 01:02:45.129]  And you gotta go, you know, officer, you guys lost a bunch of suits, I'm informed.
[01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:46.971]  And then they'll look at you and just go.
[01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:53.240]  Okay, and then they'll mass riot troops across the street and say, we're gonna arrest you now.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.463]  And I go, fine, I'm gonna sue you personally.
[01:02:56.463 --> 01:02:59.485]  Please don't violate the Bill of Rights.
[01:02:59.485 --> 01:03:04.069]  Please have some common decency and the cops will just... I mean, I've got it on video.
[01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:06.792]  One time protesting Perry outside a hotel.
[01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:08.573]  The cop just goes, fine!
[01:03:08.573 --> 01:03:12.137]  And stomps off pure color of law, totally illegal.
[01:03:13.802 --> 01:03:22.026]  A tyrant they're trying to twist and all these TV shows where the cops are always heroes and good guys and everything.
[01:03:22.026 --> 01:03:28.408]  I'm supposed to like not sit here and criticize the cop for doing that.
[01:03:28.408 --> 01:03:29.749]  There's no greater danger.
[01:03:32.179 --> 01:03:41.426]  than uniformed agents of the state calling themselves authorities and officials openly trying to intimidate people off the street corner.
[01:03:41.426 --> 01:03:48.951]  I mean, that's the essence of the KGB, the essence of Nazi Germany, the essence of what the Redcoats were doing pre-1776.
[01:03:48.951 --> 01:03:58.438]  I mean, this is armed thugs with a tin badge coming over and saying, you as an American can't stand on the street corner and do what you're doing.
[01:04:01.241 --> 01:04:14.207]  And I mean, I feel sorry for those New York cops that arrested me for protesting Haroldo Rivera and then charging me with something that wasn't an arrestable offense, that they crammed the cuffs on.
[01:04:14.207 --> 01:04:15.167]  I didn't resist in any way.
[01:04:15.167 --> 01:04:16.428]  I was polite.
[01:04:16.428 --> 01:04:18.088]  They should turn around.
[01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:21.390]  And they just wrenched them on as hard as they could and were laughing about it.
[01:04:28.123 --> 01:04:29.044]  It's just amazing.
[01:04:29.044 --> 01:04:40.271]  I mean, what type of person would see an American protesting outside Fox Studios as somebody who needed to be taught?
[01:04:40.271 --> 01:04:42.572]  I mean, they should be proud of me.
[01:04:42.572 --> 01:04:43.773]  They should be proud of the first one.
[01:04:43.773 --> 01:04:45.794]  They should be proud of living in America.
[01:04:45.794 --> 01:04:48.276]  But instead, I need to be taught.
[01:04:48.276 --> 01:04:49.797]  What cell do we put him in?
[01:04:49.797 --> 01:04:51.618]  Put him in the dirty cell.
[01:04:51.618 --> 01:04:56.201]  Shove me in there with crap all over the floor, everything else, and laugh about it.
[01:04:57.233 --> 01:05:00.656]  I mean, what does that say about their souls?
[01:05:00.656 --> 01:05:01.817]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:01.817 --> 01:05:08.744]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.744 --> 01:05:11.307]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:16.672]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.672 --> 01:05:19.735]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.735 --> 01:05:21.797]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:22.017 --> 01:05:28.282]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.282 --> 01:05:31.664]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.664 --> 01:05:37.448]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.448 --> 01:05:39.089]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.089 --> 01:05:40.370]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:43.052]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:43.052 --> 01:05:47.275]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.275 --> 01:05:49.317]  You can find the video at www.
[01:05:50.317 --> 01:06:03.204]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:03.204 --> 01:06:08.506]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:10.027]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:10.027 --> 01:06:18.832]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:19.552 --> 01:06:27.094]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:06:27.094 --> 01:06:35.096]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:35.096 --> 01:06:40.318]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:16.454]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:16.454 --> 01:07:20.137]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:21.144 --> 01:07:33.916]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:41.162]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:08:11.914 --> 01:08:13.454]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.454 --> 01:08:17.636]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:32.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.481]  Well, for the next 50,
[01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:42.869]  Three minutes or so, we are joined by a true patriot icon, Red Beckman.
[01:08:42.869 --> 01:08:48.890]  Influential figure, really, in the founding of the modern resurgence of the militia movement.
[01:08:48.890 --> 01:09:03.533]  Anti-private fellow reserve activist, the founder of the Fully Informed Jury Association movement, the co-author of The Law That Never Was, The Fraud of the 16th Amendment, and Personal Income Tax, by Bill Benson and M.J.
[01:09:03.533 --> 01:09:04.073]  Red Beckman.
[01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:08.251]  Just an amazing individual, author of so many other books.
[01:09:08.251 --> 01:09:15.256]  Born Again Republic, Walls in Our Minds, IRS, and the Black Robed Cover-Up.
[01:09:15.256 --> 01:09:19.219]  I mean, he is the proto-Tea Party.
[01:09:19.219 --> 01:09:21.101]  He is the proto-Ron Paul.
[01:09:21.101 --> 01:09:24.584]  He is the... There's very few people.
[01:09:24.584 --> 01:09:27.286]  What, a Bob Chapman?
[01:09:27.286 --> 01:09:34.892]  A... Oh, there's people like... I mean, there's not many others out there.
[01:09:35.988 --> 01:09:36.428]  I don't
[01:09:54.403 --> 01:09:54.923]  What do you think?
[01:10:14.694 --> 01:10:17.156]  If you don't want to turn your guns in, you're American Al Qaeda.
[01:10:17.156 --> 01:10:22.241]  If you don't like government-run health care, you're a white supremacist American Al Qaeda.
[01:10:22.241 --> 01:10:28.766]  And I see a real preparatory phase where they're saying, these groups are going to stage in Oklahoma City.
[01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:38.255]  And White House advisors, several of them, even Glenn Beck covered this three months ago, have come out and said, listing myself and Glenn Beck of all people, that we're going to cause a new Oklahoma City.
[01:10:39.264 --> 01:10:45.548]  And then they go on in the internal letters that have been public saying how great one would be and how it would help their agenda.
[01:10:45.548 --> 01:10:55.715]  So the real restoration movement against the globalist revolution to destroy our republic and make us debtor slaves is in high gear.
[01:10:55.715 --> 01:11:06.843]  And the revolutionaries, the cannon fodder communists and their collectivist, they're being told that their gravy train is going to continue, their welfare train, if they can destroy the middle class.
[01:11:07.728 --> 01:11:09.710]  And of course, they'll never even get any of the chicken feed.
[01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:11.371]  That'll continue to go offshore.
[01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:20.818]  Now, George Soros, according to even the Associated Press, Fox News, and other breakdowns, has spent $46 million so far this year.
[01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:28.363]  He's gone into high gear with color revolution leftist groups, because they know the revolution's coming with the collapse of society.
[01:11:28.363 --> 01:11:32.406]  And I asked Red Beckman in the last break, I said, what is most important?
[01:11:32.406 --> 01:11:33.367]  We were getting ready to come on.
[01:11:33.367 --> 01:11:34.728]  What do you want to talk about first?
[01:11:34.728 --> 01:11:36.470]  And he basically said what I just said.
[01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:38.571]  from a historical perspective.
[01:11:38.571 --> 01:11:44.194]  He called it stealing the revolution or stealing the restoration is what I would dub it.
[01:11:44.194 --> 01:11:46.755]  These are the most dangerous times we've ever been in.
[01:11:46.755 --> 01:11:54.079]  This same group of international banks that are based in Europe where the bailout money went financed the Russian takeover on record.
[01:11:54.079 --> 01:11:56.641]  They financed Hitler as a wind-up toy.
[01:11:56.641 --> 01:11:58.262]  That's on record.
[01:11:58.262 --> 01:12:00.623]  So they can then counter him.
[01:12:00.623 --> 01:12:02.944]  They do plan a hot revolution.
[01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:03.985]  And the Marxist-Leninist
[01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:08.820]  Leadership does say blood is the answer.
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:22.224]  I sat across the table a few weeks ago from a well-known leftist who confided they were really a Marxist and blood was the answer, after they had a few drinks in them, and said it very proudly.
[01:12:22.224 --> 01:12:29.707]  But it's going to be blood of somebody that owns a car dealership, not of the globalists sitting offshore.
[01:12:29.707 --> 01:12:32.648]  It's going to be the blood of anybody that's got one more dollar than them.
[01:12:33.573 --> 01:12:38.698]  And this whole thing's been financed by the Ford Foundation and others on record.
[01:12:38.698 --> 01:12:41.520]  The illegal alien brigades, all of it.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.681]  But the globalists are in trouble.
[01:12:42.681 --> 01:12:44.823]  The awakening was stronger than they predicted it would be.
[01:12:44.823 --> 01:12:48.166]  They knew moving the system in, there would be a counter to it.
[01:12:48.166 --> 01:12:50.729]  And Red Beckman joins us.
[01:12:50.729 --> 01:12:59.557]  Red, break down your concern and the message we've got to get out to the Tea Party dealing with the stealing of the revolution.
[01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:06.412]  By the way, it's real good to be back on your show.
[01:13:06.412 --> 01:13:10.135]  It's been a while since I've been on.
[01:13:16.144 --> 01:13:29.672]  I think that the Tea Party thing, you know, I was afraid they might kind of fade out and kind of disappear after the election, but that's not the case.
[01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:44.000]  They are continuing to learn and grow, and this is one of the best things that we've ever had happen in the country, because they are continuing, and there's no way
[01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:52.888]  With the radio talk shows and the internet and everything, they are learning.
[01:13:52.888 --> 01:14:01.917]  They're getting an education on how this thing has deteriorated and who's behind it.
[01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:17.889]  A real gratifying thing for me, because way back 25 years or so ago, people would ask me, they'd say, well, when is this all going to happen?
[01:14:17.889 --> 01:14:19.951]  When are we going to get this turned around?
[01:14:19.951 --> 01:14:26.417]  And I would tell them, I'd say, it's not going to happen until we have an economic meltdown.
[01:14:27.157 --> 01:14:29.699]  And then we'll have the people's attention.
[01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:32.421]  And that's exactly what has happened.
[01:14:32.421 --> 01:14:42.728]  And so what we need to get across to the Tea Party people is that it's actually a very small minority.
[01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:53.256]  The international bankers and the George Soros's and the schemers, they're a very small minority.
[01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:56.438]  The Tea Party people are the majority.
[01:14:57.943 --> 01:15:13.912]  Uh, and when I say tea party, I'm thinking of not just, uh, uh, you know, the people that call them tea parties, uh, people, but, uh, I'm just guessing that there's probably ten times as many people.
[01:15:14.964 --> 01:15:28.160]  Out there that think like the Tea Party people that are just laying low and just trying to learn and play catch up on what is happening to our country.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.846]  And so the majority in this country right now
[01:15:34.753 --> 01:15:40.176]  We are swinging over to our way of thinking.
[01:15:40.176 --> 01:15:41.357]  We want to be free.
[01:15:41.357 --> 01:15:44.598]  We don't want to be governed.
[01:15:44.598 --> 01:15:55.745]  We don't want to be plundered by that elite group of bankers and international scoundrels.
[01:15:55.745 --> 01:15:57.086]  I'll tell you the one thing.
[01:15:58.209 --> 01:16:16.586]  That the scoundrels, the Bolsheviks, I'm going to call them the Bolsheviks just like in 1917, they can only operate if the people are ignorant and don't know about their schemes.
[01:16:17.489 --> 01:16:30.157]  And so it's of the utmost importance that we get across to the people, the Tea Party people, the majority in this nation, the story of these scoundrels and who they are.
[01:16:30.157 --> 01:16:32.919]  And when that happens, they're exposed.
[01:16:36.419 --> 01:16:50.602]  Yeah, this isn't Russia where you had a bunch of good Christian hard-working but disarmed peasants who'd already been under tyranny of the czar and just traded it out for something far worse.
[01:16:50.602 --> 01:16:52.102]  Red, I want to bring this up right now.
[01:16:52.102 --> 01:16:53.102]  We have
[01:16:56.252 --> 01:17:07.254]  Newt Gingrich, who I hear mainline talk radio hailing as this great conservative, Newt Gingrich is an anti-gun, pro-socialist health care, pro-carbon tax pusher.
[01:17:07.254 --> 01:17:19.377]  And I tell Republicans this face-to-face and they laugh at me, and then on my iPhone at restaurants and on the street or with neighbors, I can pull it up and show him on TV ads for carbon taxes, I can show him for socialist health care.
[01:17:20.077 --> 01:17:20.257]  Yes.
[01:17:20.257 --> 01:17:20.337]  Yes.
[01:17:41.317 --> 01:17:50.687]  few years ago and Bush was still in office and a guy came over, it's a big gun shop, and said, Alex, I don't appreciate you lying about President Bush and saying he supported the assault weapons ban.
[01:17:50.687 --> 01:17:51.388]  I didn't get mad.
[01:17:51.388 --> 01:17:54.070]  I said, well, I said, it's a fact.
[01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:58.735]  And then the owner comes over, or one of the managers, I believe it was the owner, and says, no, Mr. Jones is right, he did.
[01:17:58.735 --> 01:17:59.916]  And the guy went, huh?
[01:17:59.916 --> 01:18:03.740]  So, you know, these people have almost invincible ignorance.
[01:18:05.048 --> 01:18:17.818]  And I remember two and a half, three years ago, right when Obama first got in, Rick Perry was being booed by the, quote, Tea Party, Senator Cornyn right here in Texas, and the left and right establishment got desperate.
[01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:20.721]  And they rushed in, they rushed in!
[01:18:20.721 --> 01:18:26.926]  And they tried to make it a partisan issue, and they said, it's only Republicans, they're being bussed in.
[01:18:28.186 --> 01:18:34.408]  They're being paid for by the Republican Party, so Democrats wouldn't feel like, hey, I'm against the big banks and bailouts.
[01:18:34.408 --> 01:18:35.648]  It was more of a Ron Paul movement.
[01:18:35.648 --> 01:18:36.488]  It was honest.
[01:18:36.488 --> 01:18:38.509]  They were doing Republicans and Democrats.
[01:18:38.509 --> 01:18:42.930]  They had it straight.
[01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:44.570]  They were Red Beckman Alex Jones listeners.
[01:18:47.891 --> 01:19:00.983]  Basically fulfill that false prophecy ran in with buses and TV ads and Fox pushing it with their own tea parties run by Dick Army To try to co-opt it, but it hasn't been totally successful, and that's why whenever
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:02.900]  Absolutely.
[01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:40.205]  You know, there's something else that is feeding into this whole picture.
[01:19:40.205 --> 01:19:40.686]  Stay there.
[01:19:40.686 --> 01:19:42.606]  Tell us about the something else on the other side.
[01:19:42.606 --> 01:19:44.967]  Then we'll look at all the movements you founded.
[01:19:44.967 --> 01:19:47.387]  Not because we're tooting Red's horn.
[01:19:47.387 --> 01:19:53.129]  It's an example of power of the individual when they have knowledge and the true role of government in our republic.
[01:19:53.129 --> 01:19:55.589]  Living legend, Red Beckman, straight ahead.
[01:19:55.589 --> 01:19:57.410]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.462]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:02.462 --> 01:21:18.035]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[01:21:18.035 --> 01:21:18.375]  dollar.
[01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:28.083]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.044]  economy and inflation.
[01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:39.359]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[01:21:39.359 --> 01:21:44.947]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[01:21:45.768 --> 01:21:55.239]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[01:21:55.239 --> 01:22:00.184]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[01:22:00.805 --> 01:22:03.206]  Spring and a new growing season are here.

[01:22:30.268 --> 01:22:31.509]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.509 --> 01:22:36.072]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.072 --> 01:22:41.876]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:45.518]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.518 --> 01:22:48.240]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:22.771 --> 01:23:28.032]  Running our hydrogen gas through your engine is the equivalent of using 140 octane fuel.

[01:23:47.176 --> 01:23:47.636]  Federal agents!
[01:23:47.636 --> 01:23:47.977]  We are armed!
[01:24:04.594 --> 01:24:07.495]  Red Beckman is our guest.
[01:24:07.495 --> 01:24:12.237]  Red, you were getting to a point as we went to break.
[01:24:35.233 --> 01:24:46.583]  Yes, and of course you brought up different organizations that I've been a part of and such.
[01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:57.152]  You had mentioned Alladask and the 60 Minutes segment that they had on Sunday night that
[01:24:59.481 --> 01:25:09.683]  They were really down on anybody that has anything bad to say about our government.
[01:25:09.683 --> 01:25:12.884]  I didn't see the program, but I know Alavasse quite well.
[01:25:12.884 --> 01:25:15.964]  He's a very sharp, sharp American.
[01:25:15.964 --> 01:25:18.425]  And a very patriotic American.
[01:25:18.425 --> 01:25:24.646]  And they were ridiculing the idea of this sovereignty.
[01:25:26.102 --> 01:25:46.599]  And I couldn't help but chuckle when I heard about it because all you have to do is ask an attorney about one person on a jury having the authority and the power to hang a jury.
[01:25:46.599 --> 01:25:52.684]  One person can hang a 12-person jury and there is no conviction when that happens.
[01:25:53.979 --> 01:26:03.605]  Uh, and of course this is where I started when I started teaching about the jury and jury nullification.
[01:26:03.605 --> 01:26:06.287]  I got a handle on that at a very early date.
[01:26:07.171 --> 01:26:29.795]  Of how that we the people have sovereignty and it is proven when we get into a court and one person hanging a jury in a tax case or any other case where the government is harassing the individual.
[01:26:29.795 --> 01:26:34.416]  One person has more power than the President of the United States.
[01:26:35.243 --> 01:26:38.385]  Even if it's Obama.
[01:26:38.385 --> 01:26:45.028]  One person has more power than the Congress, the House and the Senate combined.
[01:26:45.028 --> 01:26:57.655]  One person on that jury has more power than the whole nine justices of the Supreme Court that are nothing more than government agents because they're all government employees.
[01:26:58.653 --> 01:27:02.975]  And so one person has that power.
[01:27:02.975 --> 01:27:08.597]  That tells us that the people are the sovereigns, not the government.
[01:27:08.597 --> 01:27:16.261]  And there's many other ways that we can, you know, identify the sovereignty of the people.
[01:27:16.261 --> 01:27:17.601]  But it would be...
[01:27:19.998 --> 01:27:29.670]  Really great if the Tea Parties would pick up on this sovereignty thing and recognize the power of a jury.
[01:27:32.484 --> 01:27:39.928]  I was the inspiration behind the formation of the Fully Informed Jury Association.
[01:27:39.928 --> 01:27:53.376]  I didn't help Don Doig and Larry Dodge to start that organization, but I started the ball rolling in December of 2011.
[01:27:56.373 --> 01:27:56.773]  1979.
[01:27:56.773 --> 01:28:06.739]  I spoke at the Libertarian State Convention, the first Libertarian party, the modern Libertarian party.
[01:28:06.739 --> 01:28:09.181]  Their first state convention in Montana.
[01:28:09.181 --> 01:28:11.142]  Larry Dodge and Don Doig were there.
[01:28:12.222 --> 01:28:16.486]  It took 10 years for them to really grasp.
[01:28:16.486 --> 01:28:25.254]  We crossed trails a number of times, of course, and I kept telling them about, you know, the jury power.
[01:28:25.254 --> 01:28:26.315]  And then in 1989, 10 years later,
[01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:31.185]  I don't think so.
[01:28:48.001 --> 01:28:54.224]  They put that organization together and that organization is doing a great job right today.
[01:28:54.224 --> 01:29:10.631]  And it's a real, it really is a tremendous thrill for me when I see what they're doing and how they're growing and it's just, everything is working for them.
[01:29:11.451 --> 01:29:18.615]  And of course the Tea Party people need to pick up on this jury thing and how important it is.
[01:29:18.615 --> 01:29:24.719]  Ned, we've got a long segment coming up and we'll be able to continue to break this down.
[01:29:24.719 --> 01:29:34.584]  I want to get into the Federal Reserve, the income tax being a fraud, the facts on that, your ideas for restoring the Republic.
[01:29:34.584 --> 01:29:40.208]  I also want to talk about the true role of the jury with you on the other side, Red Beckman.
[01:29:41.534 --> 01:29:51.167]  Is our guest, and the Fully Informed Jury Association has done such a good job educating jurors that the globalists are trying to move to get rid of juries altogether.
[01:29:51.167 --> 01:29:55.092]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.092 --> 01:29:57.755]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:05.271]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.271 --> 01:30:06.191]  Number 1.
[01:30:06.191 --> 01:30:09.614]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.614 --> 01:30:10.474]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.474 --> 01:30:15.357]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.357 --> 01:30:16.098]  It's true.
[01:30:16.098 --> 01:30:20.981]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.981 --> 01:30:21.801]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.801 --> 01:30:25.384]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.384 --> 01:30:29.086]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.286 --> 01:30:30.086]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.086 --> 01:30:32.847]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.847 --> 01:30:36.528]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.528 --> 01:30:37.309]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.309 --> 01:30:41.470]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:46.512]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.512 --> 01:30:50.693]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.693 --> 01:30:52.473]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:30:57.415 --> 01:30:57.455]  877-327-0365.
[01:31:00.546 --> 01:31:04.368]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:31:04.368 --> 01:31:08.650]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:13.353]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:31:13.353 --> 01:31:19.296]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:31:19.296 --> 01:31:26.519]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:31:29.085 --> 01:31:34.608]  I'm looking for America.
[01:31:34.608 --> 01:31:36.248]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:31:36.248 --> 01:31:38.969]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:31:55.043 --> 01:32:00.287]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:32:00.287 --> 01:32:03.269]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[01:32:03.269 --> 01:32:06.891]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[01:32:06.891 --> 01:32:13.516]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:13.516 --> 01:32:18.900]  Demand for food is high, but eFoodsDirect has plenty of radiation-free food to meet your needs.

[01:32:24.764 --> 01:32:25.525]  We're good to go.
[01:32:50.546 --> 01:32:53.233]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:33:31.792 --> 01:33:41.981]  Going back to Red Beckman here in a moment and we're going to talk just briefly on each issue, how the Federal Reserve took over, what the 16th Amendment really did.
[01:33:41.981 --> 01:33:47.465]  They went to all the major states that existed at the time, it was not ratified and documented.
[01:33:47.465 --> 01:33:49.887]  It went to all the state attorney generals.
[01:33:49.887 --> 01:33:56.773]  Also these headlines now in the news, oh the police come in your house without warrants now, oh Supreme Court's ruling that, oh
[01:33:59.192 --> 01:34:06.377]  They're using the secret sneak and peek where they break in your house and not tell you they were there in non-terror related cases.
[01:34:06.377 --> 01:34:09.480]  Of course they are!
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.562]  What Red Beckman thinks about the TSA sticking the hands down the pants?
[01:34:12.562 --> 01:34:14.644]  It's obviously meant to break our will.
[01:34:14.644 --> 01:34:18.006]  We're going to break it all down with Red Beckman here in a moment.
[01:34:18.006 --> 01:34:21.969]  First I want to tell you about the National Inflation Association.
[01:34:21.969 --> 01:34:23.110]  Two-thirds of Americans
[01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:25.432]  Are getting ready to retire.
[01:34:25.432 --> 01:34:28.373]  Social Security will be more than 50% of their income.
[01:34:28.373 --> 01:34:32.175]  And 22% of upcoming retirees Social Security will be their only income.
[01:34:32.175 --> 01:34:39.659]  When massive inflation wipes out purchasing power of American Social Security payments, retirement in America will become a thing of the past.
[01:34:39.659 --> 01:34:44.022]  And we will see millions of retired senior citizens re-enter the workforce.
[01:34:44.022 --> 01:34:51.866]  Combined with millions of government workers who will soon need to find new jobs when the dollar becomes worthless and the new government goes bust.
[01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:54.231]  And the government goes bust.
[01:34:54.231 --> 01:34:59.172]  It will be nearly impossible for upcoming college graduates to find a job in the US.
[01:34:59.172 --> 01:35:06.115]  Go to inflation.us and click on the videos tab to see the breakthrough film, The College Conspiracy, today.
[01:35:06.115 --> 01:35:11.397]  Again, that's inflation.us to watch the free film today, inflation.us.
[01:35:11.397 --> 01:35:13.098]  And it's also, you can sign up there for the newsletter.
[01:35:13.928 --> 01:35:24.632]  Now, also don't forget that we have the online video bookstore with Jason Mermin's powerful film that we produced, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined.
[01:35:24.632 --> 01:35:37.598]  Mark Dice's amazing new book titled Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True to show how so much of what is talked about in that book, A Vision of a Nightmare Future, is now happening and more.
[01:35:37.598 --> 01:35:39.058]  Jesse Ventura's new book.
[01:35:39.058 --> 01:35:43.100]  We have specials where you get both books and get any one of my films you choose free.
[01:35:44.734 --> 01:35:50.059]  On top of it, we also now have show us the birth certificate.
[01:35:50.059 --> 01:35:52.821]  Where is the birth certificate by Jerome Corsi?
[01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:56.864]  The president releasing that obvious fake answered none of those questions.
[01:35:56.864 --> 01:36:03.549]  And the old birth certificate they released, its code number that's supposed to match the original doesn't match.
[01:36:03.549 --> 01:36:04.971]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:36:04.971 --> 01:36:09.074]  But that book is available at Infowars.com as well.
[01:36:09.074 --> 01:36:13.397]  And don't forget, all of my films, the live stream of this radio show, the video stream,
[01:36:14.218 --> 01:36:30.686]  My book, Paul Watson's book, Expanded Extras, the new special presentation and interview with Stuart Rhodes and others, The State Strike Back, dealing with the movement for state nullification of out-of-control federal behavior.
[01:36:30.686 --> 01:36:35.129]  That's now at PrisonPlanet.TV as well.
[01:36:35.129 --> 01:36:40.611]  And we also have all the new great t-shirts, books, and videos at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:40.611 --> 01:36:43.293]  A lot more than what I just mentioned there.
[01:36:44.133 --> 01:36:50.318]  And your purchase of the books, the videos, and your support of the sponsors is what makes this radio broadcast possible.
[01:36:50.318 --> 01:36:57.304]  The toll-free number to call and order the books and videos or to ask questions about combos and specials we're running is 888-253-3139.
[01:36:57.304 --> 01:36:57.444]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:57.444 --> 01:36:59.026]  Or you can write to us here at P.O.
[01:36:59.026 --> 01:36:59.566]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:37:09.269 --> 01:37:29.162]  Now, going back to Red Beckman, Red, you specifically off-air made the point to yours truly that you don't see any way that this system is not going to collapse, and that it's through that crisis that the establishment is going to try to put forward its false solutions, which are more of what brought us to this point.
[01:37:30.538 --> 01:37:48.671]  Yeah, that's why I stressed that the Tea Party people and the people that think like those Tea Party people really need to recognize the fact that they're the majority.
[01:37:48.671 --> 01:37:56.316]  That they are armed and they are becoming informed about what's happening in our country.
[01:37:57.553 --> 01:38:00.256]  Because they need to have a lot of confidence.
[01:38:00.256 --> 01:38:15.528]  They need to have the kind of confidence that will help them to, you might say, counter all the propaganda and such that's going to be put out by the major media.
[01:38:15.528 --> 01:38:20.532]  Because we have to recognize that the major media is not on the part of we the people.
[01:38:20.532 --> 01:38:22.254]  They're not representing us at all.
[01:38:23.178 --> 01:38:32.225]  And so, um, we've got to get it across to the Tea Party people that we are the majority.
[01:38:32.225 --> 01:38:44.134]  And we are not going to tolerate, you know, a takeover of our political system like they did in Russia back in 1917.
[01:38:44.134 --> 01:38:45.976]  We're not going to let that happen.
[01:38:45.976 --> 01:38:49.999]  We have learned some lessons from what happened to those people back then.
[01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:52.132]  We're not going to let it happen.
[01:38:52.132 --> 01:38:55.874]  We don't have to let it happen.
[01:38:55.874 --> 01:39:01.077]  I'm always the optimist.
[01:39:01.077 --> 01:39:05.259]  And I think we've got a lot to be optimistic about at this point in time.
[01:39:05.259 --> 01:39:09.562]  And of course, you mentioned the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:39:09.562 --> 01:39:10.182]  Believe you me,
[01:39:12.688 --> 01:39:20.013]  Before people had their houses foreclosed and all, you couldn't explain anything to them about the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:39:20.013 --> 01:39:21.294]  They just didn't know.
[01:39:21.294 --> 01:39:26.457]  They thought it was part of the federal government and all that.
[01:39:26.457 --> 01:39:36.604]  When somebody gets in that kind of financial trouble where their house is being foreclosed, you can educate those people.
[01:39:36.604 --> 01:39:41.147]  You can tell those people about the Federal Reserve Bank and they can grasp what you're saying.
[01:39:45.431 --> 01:39:58.346]  Well, I'll tell you what they really grasp, that it was secret where the tens of trillions went, and when we finally found out about where some of it went, it was the foreign offshore banks.
[01:39:58.866 --> 01:40:00.287]  Who owned the Federal Reserve.
[01:40:00.287 --> 01:40:04.689]  It was to media, thousands of newspapers, MSNBC.
[01:40:04.689 --> 01:40:13.973]  Rachel Maddow is paid by the Federal Reserve with our money to sit there and say people that don't like the Federal Reserve are terrorists.
[01:40:13.973 --> 01:40:18.575]  I mean, this is outrageous, naked propaganda.
[01:40:18.575 --> 01:40:22.737]  And as people learn more and more, I mean, take Iceland.
[01:40:22.737 --> 01:40:23.358]  They said no.
[01:40:24.498 --> 01:40:24.759]  I don't
[01:40:42.259 --> 01:40:43.440]  Was in debt.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.943]  And the same thing just came out over 80% in Ireland.
[01:40:47.943 --> 01:40:49.363]  They didn't owe this.
[01:40:49.363 --> 01:40:57.348]  The banks too big to fail say, we've got to raise your taxes, we've got to do all this to you, or the economy will implode, you owe us this.
[01:40:57.348 --> 01:41:01.071]  But only because they bought off the governments to have them to sign on to it.
[01:41:01.071 --> 01:41:07.255]  And the big Federal Reserve lackeys, the IMF World Bank lackeys, have on record positioned the US and Europe
[01:41:08.015 --> 01:41:12.398]  For economic implosion, as economic hitmen, to go into receivership.
[01:41:12.398 --> 01:41:26.506]  This is on record, but they've miscalculated, because now we go from Ron Paul having no co-sponsors 16 years ago for his bill to audit and then basically in the Fed, and now it passed the House, was killed in the Senate.
[01:41:26.506 --> 01:41:32.090]  The point is, that's why Brzezinski last year came out and said, the elite are in deep trouble.
[01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:35.652]  For the first time, all of humanity is awake and staring at the elite.
[01:41:36.152 --> 01:41:40.975]  We're not staring now at their puppet frontman Republican Democrat that come and go.
[01:41:40.975 --> 01:41:57.664]  People are really starting to learn about who really runs the show through fraud and how these big mega banks have record bonuses from our tax money and that even the austerity they're talking about is just to cut government so all the money can go to the bankers.
[01:41:57.664 --> 01:41:58.264]  We're saying no.
[01:41:58.664 --> 01:42:14.715]  Get rid of the Federal Reserve right off the quadrillion in derivatives first, then we'll talk about getting rid of all this welfare, which is what they use to make people dependent so they can use the welfare hordes as an army against the middle class, you know, the elite's cannon fodder.
[01:42:14.715 --> 01:42:16.056]  So it's all coming to a head.
[01:42:16.056 --> 01:42:24.542]  Red, let's talk about who the banksters are, what the Federal Reserve Act is, the law that never was investigation.
[01:42:26.383 --> 01:42:30.286]  Because on the 60 Minutes piece, they're like, what's gonna run the government if you don't pay income tax?
[01:42:30.286 --> 01:42:34.070]  And I love how Ron Paul always points out on TV when they say that.
[01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:39.074]  That the Capitol and the whole government was built without an income tax.
[01:42:39.074 --> 01:42:44.098]  So explain the reality to folks.
[01:42:44.098 --> 01:42:48.602]  You see, the Constitution for the United States of America
[01:42:49.854 --> 01:43:01.361]  Um, Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, uh, says that the Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, excises, impos and duties.
[01:43:01.361 --> 01:43:08.666]  Uh, there's absolutely no constitutional basis, uh, for an income tax.
[01:43:08.666 --> 01:43:10.147]  It's totally forbidden.
[01:43:10.147 --> 01:43:14.349]  Um, the federal government was to, um,
[01:43:16.514 --> 01:43:24.947]  Get the financing to keep itself alive and going was to collect tariffs and excises and such.
[01:43:24.947 --> 01:43:28.392]  But Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4 says...
[01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:32.511]  There can be no direct tax.
[01:43:32.511 --> 01:43:37.213]  And a direct tax, of course, is directly on the individual.
[01:43:37.213 --> 01:43:48.877]  And so the Constitution, the founders were wise men, and they put it right there in the Constitution, that there can be no direct tax.
[01:43:48.877 --> 01:43:57.240]  And the income tax is a direct tax, so it's in direct violation of the Constitution for the United States of America.
[01:43:58.515 --> 01:44:26.665]  Um, you know, I remember, I've been around long enough, I remember, uh, World War II, uh, when Vivian Callums, the, uh, lady industrialist from the East Coast, uh, she took on the Internal Revenue Service in the federal government when they passed this, uh, nonsense about the withholding tax, and it was going to be just a wartime tax, and, uh, it was supposed to be, uh, removed after the war was over.
[01:44:27.569 --> 01:44:33.035]  And, uh, Vivian Callum had about 400 employees.
[01:44:33.035 --> 01:44:40.504]  And she said, I am not going to do all that additional book work to withhold taxes.
[01:44:40.504 --> 01:44:43.727]  She said it is involuntary servitude.
[01:44:43.727 --> 01:44:48.873]  And she ended up in court and it was a long battle, but she finally won it.
[01:44:49.979 --> 01:44:56.961]  Um, but, um, you see, um, they told us so many lies, and everything is a lie anymore.
[01:44:56.961 --> 01:44:58.961]  You just don't get the truth.
[01:44:58.961 --> 01:45:07.584]  They told us that the withholding tax would cease, uh, after the war, and, uh, it's still with us today, all these many, many years later.
[01:45:07.584 --> 01:45:12.105]  And of course, uh, back in Montana in 1980,
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:25.829]  Uh, we had some farmers, ranchers, small business people and such that got their heads together and said, uh, we're gonna find out if the 16th Amendment was properly ratified.
[01:45:25.829 --> 01:45:41.740]  Uh, because, uh, the 16th Amendment was supposedly, uh, uh, ratified so that the Congress could get around Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution and Article 1, Section 9, the Direct Act.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:49.426]  And of course, those people there in Montana, they did a lot of research.
[01:45:49.426 --> 01:45:54.149]  They checked with all the state archives and all that type of thing.
[01:45:54.149 --> 01:46:10.783]  And by 1983, January of 83, they had the documentations from each and every state having to do with how the state legislatures had operated and how they had voted for the 16th Amendment.
[01:46:11.583 --> 01:46:14.186]  Or voted against it, or most of them did.
[01:46:14.186 --> 01:46:27.721]  In fact, if we want to be technical, and of course the law is supposed to be technical, if we check the documentation real carefully,
[01:46:28.806 --> 01:46:35.551]  Not one single state properly ratified the 16th Amendment to the Constitution.
[01:46:35.551 --> 01:46:45.118]  And that was 1913 when they declared that it was to be part of our Constitution that it had been ratified.
[01:46:45.118 --> 01:46:48.160]  We, the American people, have been far too patient.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.243]  We've been far too easy to get along with.
[01:46:54.210 --> 01:47:01.833]  But that is changing and people now are learning about the 16th Amendment and the fraud.
[01:47:01.833 --> 01:47:04.494]  But to be clear though, because I've read the law that never was.
[01:47:04.494 --> 01:47:05.534]  Everything they can.
[01:47:05.534 --> 01:47:13.017]  I read, I just interrupt because I've read you and Benson's book and I've gone and looked into it.
[01:47:13.857 --> 01:47:27.810]  It is true that none of them properly did it, but from your research, because I haven't read the book in over a decade, how many states just completely didn't even ratify it, but were listed, and how did the system get away with that?
[01:47:27.810 --> 01:47:27.990]  Why?
[01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:38.239]  Because the states were meeting every two years or so, and there wasn't good coordination, and so the feds just announced, and at the same time they got rid of the states, having U.S.
[01:47:38.239 --> 01:47:38.679]  senators
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:45.062]  Where the state's legislatures would vote for the senators so they controlled them.
[01:47:45.062 --> 01:47:45.803]  They got rid of that.
[01:47:45.803 --> 01:47:46.903]  They gave us the income tax.
[01:47:46.903 --> 01:47:48.024]  They gave us the Federal Reserve.
[01:47:48.024 --> 01:47:51.005]  I mean, they did it all in one fell swoop.
[01:47:51.005 --> 01:47:53.366]  How was that coup rammed through?
[01:47:53.366 --> 01:47:55.067]  And did any states complain about it?
[01:47:56.629 --> 01:48:05.816]  Uh, there were some states that complained about it, but not to the point where they were heard.
[01:48:05.816 --> 01:48:15.782]  You have to recognize the fact that our media back then consisted of one thing, and that was newspapers.
[01:48:15.782 --> 01:48:21.746]  And that was controlled basically by the William Randolph Hearst organization.
[01:48:21.746 --> 01:48:25.129]  And even at that stage of the game,
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:31.191]  Uh, the media, uh, was already controlled.
[01:48:31.191 --> 01:48:33.456]  And, uh, the media was, uh...
[01:48:35.799 --> 01:48:40.002]  You know, the media was not for the people.
[01:48:40.002 --> 01:48:41.243]  It was for the elite.
[01:48:41.243 --> 01:48:45.265]  It was controlled by the elite.
[01:48:45.265 --> 01:48:50.148]  William Randolph Hearst would have to be recognized as part of the elite.
[01:48:50.148 --> 01:49:01.996]  And he was, his news organization, his newspaper kingdom, was the source for all information for all the newspapers in the country for the most part.
[01:49:02.848 --> 01:49:16.356]  And so, um, the people weren't told, uh, the truth, and, uh, so they weren't, uh, and of course, you've got to remember that, uh, they sold this idea to the American people.
[01:49:16.356 --> 01:49:18.818]  They said, we're gonna, we're gonna soak the rich.
[01:49:19.767 --> 01:49:21.188]  We're going to soak the rich.
[01:49:21.188 --> 01:49:23.450]  We're going to tax the rich.
[01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:28.774]  And that always sounds good to the low-income people.
[01:49:28.774 --> 01:49:32.937]  Let the government tax the rich and leave us alone.
[01:49:32.937 --> 01:49:34.518]  Well, it never works that way.
[01:49:34.518 --> 01:49:43.745]  They might say that they're going to tax the rich, but it's always the lower echelon in the economy that get the taxes.
[01:49:46.814 --> 01:49:56.620]  You know, anytime that congressmen and senators talk about tax reform, it means just one thing, and that is a tax increase.
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:58.140]  All right, let me stop you, Red.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:01.522]  We've got to go to break here in a moment, but I need to add this caveat.
[01:50:01.522 --> 01:50:04.284]  Look at Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
[01:50:04.284 --> 01:50:07.646]  $3,000 a night hotels, you know, jets all over the world.
[01:50:08.366 --> 01:50:25.974]  On US and European taxpayers, that's who fund the organization, and he's the socialist leader of France, set to beat Nicolas Sarkozy in the next election until this latest purported event with him and the sodomizing the lady.
[01:50:25.974 --> 01:50:28.335]  Now, there's an example right there.
[01:50:28.335 --> 01:50:30.776]  The socialist leader is an international banker.
[01:50:31.776 --> 01:50:35.518]  Known for getting countries deep into debt out of fiat they make out of nothing.
[01:50:35.518 --> 01:50:37.039]  And there's the Communist Manifesto.
[01:50:37.039 --> 01:50:37.779]  What's it want?
[01:50:37.779 --> 01:50:40.460]  A private central bank.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:43.382]  A graduated income tax.
[01:50:43.382 --> 01:50:47.444]  Government education.
[01:50:47.444 --> 01:50:49.685]  All the things that we have.
[01:50:49.685 --> 01:50:52.446]  Because this is how the bankers come in and take over your nation.
[01:50:52.446 --> 01:50:55.368]  They put in this income tax to be paid to them.
[01:50:57.566 --> 01:50:58.727]  We'll be right back with Red Beckman.
[01:50:58.727 --> 01:51:01.188]  We're going to talk about some other key areas as well.
[01:51:01.188 --> 01:51:02.488]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.488 --> 01:51:08.071]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.071 --> 01:51:13.093]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.093 --> 01:51:13.573]  It's true.
[01:51:13.573 --> 01:51:16.394]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:16.394 --> 01:51:18.135]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.655 --> 01:51:23.876]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.876 --> 01:51:30.998]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.998 --> 01:51:32.118]  And here's the best part.

[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:00.300]  I think?
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:20.201]  For your body to make optimal levels of glutathione, it needs an abundance of the amino acid cysteine.
[01:53:20.201 --> 01:53:26.462]  The highest dietary source of cysteine is non-denatured whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:26.462 --> 01:53:30.943]  The most non-denatured whey protein powder on the market is One World Whey.
[01:53:30.943 --> 01:53:34.564]  One World Whey is an industry first with its true cool process.
[01:53:34.564 --> 01:53:37.965]  It retains all the active components of fresh raw whey.
[01:53:37.965 --> 01:53:44.746]  One World Whey is rich in immune, bodybuilding, and detoxification factors that make it a life-giving power food for everyone.
[01:53:45.046 --> 01:53:49.669]  One World Whey is sweetened with cold processed stevia and comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:53.591]  To hear some impressive testimonies, go to OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:53:53.591 --> 01:53:56.613]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:53:56.613 --> 01:53:57.153]  Or call 888-988-3325.
[01:54:14.518 --> 01:54:18.201]  We've got Red Beckman with us five minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:18.201 --> 01:54:25.528]  I'm then going to open the phones up for a couple segments on any issue I've mentioned, any topic I've brought up, or any points or questions you've got.
[01:54:25.528 --> 01:54:26.889]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:54:26.889 --> 01:54:27.049]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:27.049 --> 01:54:30.833]  And we'll get you up and on the air today on the reactor cover-up going on, ongoing fires and explosions.
[01:54:40.741 --> 01:54:46.867]  Uh, the announcement that yes, we are having more warrantless entry of homes.
[01:54:46.867 --> 01:54:50.830]  Yes, we're having secret warrants to break into your house and not let you know we were there.
[01:54:50.830 --> 01:54:53.373]  I mean, the essence of framing people.
[01:54:54.417 --> 01:54:57.299]  That's what those are really for.
[01:54:57.299 --> 01:54:59.921]  Just all of the incredible news.
[01:54:59.921 --> 01:55:02.383]  Also, Aaron Dykes has got a big report up.
[01:55:02.383 --> 01:55:06.766]  Lieberman will have questions about a Lockheed Post 9-11 Pentagon dinner.
[01:55:06.766 --> 01:55:17.013]  This is, I kept saying two months, sometimes I get stuff backwards, two weeks after 9-11, when he was on the news as the number three guy in Al Qaeda.
[01:55:17.013 --> 01:55:19.155]  All over the news, the leader of American Al Qaeda.
[01:55:20.333 --> 01:55:23.374]  And he's secretly hanging out at the Pentagon with the Secretary of the Army.
[01:55:23.374 --> 01:55:26.135]  And there's more news out today from Watson.
[01:55:26.135 --> 01:55:28.975]  New Al-Qaeda leader claims he has nothing to do with Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:28.975 --> 01:55:31.616]  Calls 9-11 a fabrication.
[01:55:31.616 --> 01:55:36.657]  Evidence suggests the new figure is another intelligence ghost.
[01:55:36.657 --> 01:55:49.101]  Looking at that, Red, why do you think they're getting so wild now announcing TSA to be on the streets, groping little girls, sticking their hands down their pants, groping Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura?
[01:55:50.242 --> 01:55:52.283]  I think it's a weakness on their part.
[01:55:52.283 --> 01:55:53.224]  I think that they are underestimated.
[01:56:14.568 --> 01:56:27.837]  The American people and the power of the people to, you know, to counter what they're doing and speak out.
[01:56:27.837 --> 01:56:37.464]  And of course, you know, talk radio, the little underground newspapers, the internet.
[01:56:40.183 --> 01:57:09.026]  My goodness, Larry, you know, the internet is alerting, uh, you know, hundreds of millions of people about what's going on, and, uh, I think that the elitists, they, uh, underestimated, uh, all of this, and of course, uh, I, I just think that they're in a panic situation because the world has gotten so small now that, uh, where are they gonna go to hide?
[01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:23.037]  Where is there on this planet that they can go and hide and not be discovered where they're at and followed up?
[01:57:23.037 --> 01:57:35.104]  It's an impossibility for them to find any safe place because they're going to need a safe place if they're going to survive.
[01:57:35.923 --> 01:57:38.326]  And there is no safe place.
[01:57:38.326 --> 01:57:40.548]  I'm absolutely convinced of it.
[01:57:40.548 --> 01:57:51.478]  The anger of the people, and this is just in the United States, the anger is building up no matter where you go on this planet.
[01:57:52.262 --> 01:57:58.965]  And so there's not too many places for the elite to hide anymore.
[01:57:58.965 --> 01:58:00.385]  I like that idea.
[01:58:00.385 --> 01:58:01.246]  Well, Red, that's right.
[01:58:01.246 --> 01:58:07.468]  I have a lot of guests I respect on, but they still have this view that the globalists are invincible.
[01:58:07.468 --> 01:58:08.689]  Look at Khan right now.
[01:58:08.689 --> 01:58:09.609]  Look at all these guys.
[01:58:09.609 --> 01:58:11.510]  They're not invincible.
[01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:15.632]  They are just ruthless, and then we're gullible and don't stand up to them.
[01:58:15.632 --> 01:58:18.093]  And look at what's happening in many other areas of the world.
[01:58:18.093 --> 01:58:20.314]  People are angry, and I...
[01:58:21.567 --> 01:58:24.348]  Folks, I am well known.
[01:58:24.348 --> 01:58:25.528]  People know what I look like.
[01:58:25.528 --> 01:58:30.549]  Many other patriots, people don't know what you look like, so they don't tell you what they're thinking.
[01:58:30.549 --> 01:58:32.569]  People know what I look like.
[01:58:32.569 --> 01:58:36.010]  I can't go to the grocery store anywhere.
[01:58:36.010 --> 01:58:42.591]  I can't go anywhere in the country, other countries now, without almost everybody coming up to me.
[01:58:42.591 --> 01:58:46.232]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.232 --> 01:58:48.312]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:56.370]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.370 --> 01:58:59.991]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:59.991 --> 01:59:02.532]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.532 --> 01:59:08.395]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.395 --> 01:59:14.658]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:15.078 --> 01:59:21.041]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:21.041 --> 01:59:25.223]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.223 --> 01:59:29.506]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.506 --> 01:59:35.469]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.469 --> 01:59:39.011]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:39.011 --> 01:59:40.992]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.992 --> 01:59:41.432]  It's here.

[01:59:53.901 --> 01:59:56.283]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.283 --> 01:59:59.085]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:10.524]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[02:00:10.524 --> 02:00:12.105]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.105 --> 02:00:13.647]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.647 --> 02:00:17.850]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.850 --> 02:00:31.922]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.922 --> 02:00:34.144]  Alright, final segment with Red Beckman.
[02:00:36.783 --> 02:00:39.424]  We're going to go to your phone calls, a lot of other news.
[02:00:39.424 --> 02:00:43.986]  Dr. Busby joins us to break down just the fact that Fukushima is even worse than we thought.
[02:00:43.986 --> 02:00:47.007]  Turns out the establishment knew how bad it was.
[02:00:47.007 --> 02:00:50.449]  Day one there was a meltdown and they just lied the whole time.
[02:00:50.449 --> 02:00:53.550]  It's just, it's so incredible.
[02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:54.311]  You notice the U.S.
[02:00:54.311 --> 02:00:59.073]  government, the military in Japan wouldn't release any numbers when they knew exactly what was going on.
[02:00:59.073 --> 02:01:00.814]  That was the big telltale sign right there.
[02:01:02.372 --> 02:01:16.476]  This thing's far from over, but because this invisible killer is drifting over here, building up every day, and the feds aren't releasing numbers, we just are in a lot of trouble.
[02:01:16.476 --> 02:01:18.977]  But going back to Red on the point of people waking up,
[02:01:20.353 --> 02:01:24.856]  Again, I'm like a litmus test because people do know what I look like.
[02:01:24.856 --> 02:01:33.902]  And just everywhere, old, young, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, I mean, I can go in a restaurant.
[02:01:33.902 --> 02:01:37.665]  A lot of nights, I'll be coming home at 5, 6 o'clock once a week.
[02:01:37.665 --> 02:01:40.006]  I'll pick dinner up twice a week sometimes.
[02:01:40.006 --> 02:01:41.067]  My wife calls it in.
[02:01:41.067 --> 02:01:41.828]  You know, I go in.
[02:01:42.968 --> 02:01:46.971]  Uh, you know, sit down at the bar to pick the food up, and the waitress is a listener.
[02:01:46.971 --> 02:01:50.873]  And everybody sitting at the bar are listeners, no matter where I go.
[02:01:50.873 --> 02:01:55.536]  And people run up to me, and then I'm walking in the parking lot, and people are stopping cars.
[02:01:55.536 --> 02:01:58.377]  Uh, and again, it's not like, ooh, look, Alex Jones is this big star.
[02:01:58.377 --> 02:01:59.318]  That's not what this is about.
[02:01:59.998 --> 02:02:04.201]  It's showing that sonar ping that we're having a huge effect.
[02:02:04.201 --> 02:02:05.162]  I could be in Canada.
[02:02:05.162 --> 02:02:06.723]  I could be in Honduras.
[02:02:06.723 --> 02:02:07.784]  I could be in Belize.
[02:02:07.784 --> 02:02:08.965]  I could be in Mexico.
[02:02:08.965 --> 02:02:11.026]  I could be in the Virgin Islands.
[02:02:11.026 --> 02:02:12.828]  I could be everywhere I've gone.
[02:02:12.828 --> 02:02:14.469]  I could be in England.
[02:02:14.469 --> 02:02:17.191]  I mean, even in England, I was in England five, six years ago.
[02:02:17.191 --> 02:02:21.074]  And a lot of people come up to me, but nothing like it is now.
[02:02:21.074 --> 02:02:23.516]  In closing, Red, this is very exciting times to be in.
[02:02:24.344 --> 02:02:28.088]  Absolutely.
[02:02:28.088 --> 02:02:44.446]  I've been fully active full-time for about 35 years or so and there's never been a time like this where the people are waking up and they're listening.
[02:02:44.446 --> 02:02:46.408]  It used to be that their hearing was so bad
[02:02:46.428 --> 02:02:55.374]  Yeah, they didn't hear, but when they get pinched in the economic vice, then their hearing gets better.
[02:02:55.374 --> 02:02:58.617]  And we're seeing that happen right now.
[02:02:58.617 --> 02:03:08.504]  I'm sure your audience has been multiplied many times over because it's a very good source of information for people.
[02:03:09.195 --> 02:03:15.577]  Well, I just know, the reason I every few weeks explain that to folks is people feel like they're alone.
[02:03:15.577 --> 02:03:17.758]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're not alone.
[02:03:17.758 --> 02:03:21.279]  I mean, if I can get off an airplane in New York or L.A.
[02:03:21.279 --> 02:03:22.800]  or Minneapolis-St.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:24.181]  Paul and I can't get 15 feet,
[02:03:25.901 --> 02:03:27.583]  I mean, I've been places with Jesse Ventura.
[02:03:27.583 --> 02:03:28.624]  People are running up to him.
[02:03:28.624 --> 02:03:29.525]  They're running up to me.
[02:03:29.525 --> 02:03:31.707]  I walk out of the bathroom.
[02:03:31.707 --> 02:03:32.547]  They're running up to me.
[02:03:32.547 --> 02:03:35.090]  Ventura's, you know, sitting there by his bags.
[02:03:35.090 --> 02:03:36.831]  There's 15 people around him.
[02:03:36.831 --> 02:03:42.716]  I mean, it's, and they're liking Ventura because of his show exposing the New World Order.
[02:03:42.716 --> 02:03:47.401]  I mean, that's the point I'm trying to get at here is that, is that
[02:03:48.655 --> 02:04:08.689]  I mean, the numbers of people that are awake are much higher than we even know, but one of the last dominoes to fall, the system's already lost its credibility, Congress with a 9% approval rating, mainstream media falling apart, dinosaur dying, but the last domino to fall is we don't realize how much power we've got, and I think that's the big secret, Red.
[02:04:09.569 --> 02:04:14.933]  Well, that's why I say that, you know, there's more of us than there is of them.
[02:04:14.933 --> 02:04:19.415]  We're a majority.
[02:04:19.415 --> 02:04:27.781]  And we can use that confidence that we get when we recognize that we're a majority.
[02:04:27.781 --> 02:04:29.862]  We need all the confidence we can get.
[02:04:30.542 --> 02:04:34.344]  And of course, history is on our side.
[02:04:34.344 --> 02:04:40.246]  We can, you know, in Russia, the U.S.S.R.
[02:04:40.246 --> 02:04:41.207]  Stay there, Red.
[02:04:41.207 --> 02:04:41.647]  Stay there.
[02:04:41.647 --> 02:04:44.588]  We'll do a few more minutes with you about history's on our side.
[02:04:44.588 --> 02:04:46.109]  Final comments from Red Beckman.
[02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:47.089]  We'll also give you his P.O.
[02:04:47.089 --> 02:04:49.490]  Box if you want to get some of his great books and booklets.
[02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:50.651]  Red Beckman's our guest.
[02:04:50.651 --> 02:04:53.432]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:04:53.432 --> 02:04:58.735]  Simulcasting, living, streaming color video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:58.735 --> 02:04:59.335]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.113 --> 02:05:03.835]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.835 --> 02:05:09.141]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:05:09.141 --> 02:05:10.683]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:10.683 --> 02:05:19.473]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:20.194 --> 02:05:27.719]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:05:27.719 --> 02:05:35.724]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:35.724 --> 02:05:40.968]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:05:40.968 --> 02:05:43.129]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:05:45.891 --> 02:05:49.113]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:05:49.113 --> 02:05:51.434]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:05:51.434 --> 02:05:53.616]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:06:00.538 --> 02:06:05.101]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.101 --> 02:06:06.022]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.022 --> 02:06:09.445]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.445 --> 02:06:10.305]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.305 --> 02:06:15.189]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.929]  It's true.
[02:06:15.929 --> 02:06:20.813]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.813 --> 02:06:21.634]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.634 --> 02:06:25.216]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.216 --> 02:06:28.919]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.119 --> 02:06:29.919]  Number four.
[02:06:29.919 --> 02:06:32.680]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:36.361]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.361 --> 02:06:37.141]  Number five.
[02:06:37.141 --> 02:06:41.302]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.302 --> 02:06:46.344]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:06:57.327 --> 02:07:03.409]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.

[02:08:02.545 --> 02:08:09.187]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues.
[02:08:09.187 --> 02:08:12.148]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.216 --> 02:08:21.780]  Red Beckman's our guest here for just a few more minutes, then we'll go into your phone calls.
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:25.443]  Because Red's sort of making the point that history is on our side.
[02:08:25.443 --> 02:08:30.787]  This is where the greatest development in human liberty ever took place.
[02:08:30.787 --> 02:08:33.189]  That's why the system attacks the founding of this republic.
[02:08:33.849 --> 02:08:44.817]  And, uh, you know, looks at the problems, but compared to everything else that came before it, it is the greatest expression of private property, family, liberty, the right to self-defense, revolutionary ideas.
[02:08:44.817 --> 02:08:48.120]  It was only the kings, the nobles, and every culture that had rights.
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:51.062]  Everybody else was seen as animals and slaves.
[02:08:51.062 --> 02:08:52.864]  And Red was starting to make that final point.
[02:08:52.864 --> 02:08:53.324]  Red Beckman.
[02:08:55.882 --> 02:09:05.471]  When the USSR went down in December of 91, it could have turned into a chaotic situation, but it didn't.
[02:09:06.987 --> 02:09:27.740]  Because the powers that be were such a small minority that they just didn't have the power to maintain control of the masses in Romania.
[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:29.902]  That was the Christmas time of 89.
[02:09:35.694 --> 02:09:35.974]  I don't
[02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:56.992]  And we're the majority, and so you're going to have to back off.
[02:09:56.992 --> 02:10:01.175]  And this is the same thing that's going to happen right here.
[02:10:01.175 --> 02:10:14.245]  I think that our military, they know they have been beat up and drugged around, you know, Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:10:17.193 --> 02:10:17.973]  We're good to go.
[02:10:47.165 --> 02:10:50.086]  Between 1215 A.D.
[02:10:50.086 --> 02:11:08.033]  and 1776, when our American War of Independence started, there was no less than 43 times that the people had to bring their king and their government back under the law, back under Magna Carta.
[02:11:08.713 --> 02:11:18.461]  There was 23 of those 43 times that they had to take the sword and use the sword and they actually shed blood.
[02:11:18.461 --> 02:11:23.285]  They beheaded one of their kings because he refused to come back under the law.
[02:11:25.326 --> 02:11:30.747]  We have a great law, the Constitution, and our Bill of Rights and all.
[02:11:30.747 --> 02:11:40.290]  These are great, great documents, and they are the backbone of our society here, our political world.
[02:11:40.290 --> 02:11:50.692]  And these elitists, they cannot survive if we the people start to enforce the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:11:50.692 --> 02:11:54.633]  And it's happening, and of course one of the great things is happening
[02:11:54.833 --> 02:12:03.317]  That's what happened when we started recognizing that federal judges are government agents.
[02:12:03.317 --> 02:12:08.119]  They are government employees and so they are government agents.
[02:12:08.119 --> 02:12:13.762]  And when they made this ruling the other day that cops can go into a house without a warrant,
[02:12:15.171 --> 02:12:29.016]  If that doesn't prove that these guys in the Supreme Court, if that doesn't prove that they are government agents, they're agents of the government and they have a conflict
[02:12:33.129 --> 02:12:36.733]  Between the citizen and the government.
[02:12:36.733 --> 02:12:47.704]  The judge, the federal judge has his conflict of interest and it is a jury that is to make the finding of fact and conclusions of law.
[02:12:47.704 --> 02:12:50.828]  And so when we have an informed jury,
[02:12:52.589 --> 02:13:10.463]  We know that the government agent sitting there in his black dress, he's not going to be able to control that jury, he's not going to be able to control the evidence, and he is going to be put in his proper position, and that is as a servant.
[02:13:10.843 --> 02:13:11.484]  Absolutely.
[02:13:11.484 --> 02:13:12.984]  Red, we're out of time.
[02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:17.467]  Briefly, you've got a lot of great books and booklets that are very inexpensive.
[02:13:17.467 --> 02:13:19.368]  You basically sell them at cost.
[02:13:19.368 --> 02:13:22.030]  They've been retired for a long time.
[02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:27.634]  You've got a lot of Born Again, Republic, Walls in Our Minds, IRS and the Black Rub cover-up.
[02:13:27.634 --> 02:13:29.315]  Tell us about a few of the deals you've got.
[02:13:29.315 --> 02:13:37.660]  Well, the last time I was on your show, we offered a copy of Walls in Our Minds and Why the Militia.
[02:13:38.821 --> 02:13:44.226]  Those are my last two books, and we offered the two books for $10.
[02:13:44.226 --> 02:13:49.912]  Anybody that'll send us a $10 bill will pay the postage and the whole works.
[02:13:49.912 --> 02:13:57.059]  But all we have to do is write to Red Mechman at P.O.
[02:13:57.059 --> 02:13:57.439]  Box 61.
[02:14:01.786 --> 02:14:08.928]  Well, C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S, Carrolls, Washington, 9-8-6-0-9.
[02:14:08.928 --> 02:14:16.250]  I lost my, I forgot my, my, it's 9-8-6-0-9, I'm pretty sure.
[02:14:16.250 --> 02:14:17.531]  The zip code.
[02:14:17.531 --> 02:14:21.572]  I guess that 82 years kind of got the best of me there a bit.
[02:14:32.211 --> 02:14:35.134]  Hey Red, folks know who you are there in your state.
[02:14:35.134 --> 02:14:36.255]  It'll get to you.
[02:14:36.255 --> 02:14:37.095]  I think so.
[02:14:37.095 --> 02:14:39.558]  And I look forward to having you back on in the near future.
[02:14:39.558 --> 02:14:40.398]  God bless you.
[02:14:40.398 --> 02:14:42.540]  Yeah, and God bless you too.
[02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:44.121]  Alright folks, there goes Red Beckman.
[02:14:44.121 --> 02:14:44.782]  Great guy.
[02:14:44.782 --> 02:14:47.724]  And we're just glad to have him.
[02:14:47.724 --> 02:14:53.529]  There was a period a few years ago where we really even couldn't have him on because of health issues, but Red is back and we love him.
[02:14:53.529 --> 02:14:54.971]  Okay, let's jam in some phone calls.
[02:14:54.971 --> 02:14:55.711]  Thanks for holding.
[02:14:55.711 --> 02:14:57.433]  Jonathan in Kansas.
[02:14:57.433 --> 02:14:58.414]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[02:14:59.810 --> 02:15:06.896]  Hey Alex, I have some things to talk about concerning 9-11.
[02:15:06.896 --> 02:15:25.432]  It's probably a good idea that you get a pen and a piece of paper because I found this two documents by Cryptome.org that came out in January about 9-11 and it deals with prior knowledge and well I don't think many, I don't think many of the
[02:15:26.058 --> 02:15:28.220]  Patriot sites have really covered it.
[02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:31.162]  Oh, there's so much evidence of it being an inside job.
[02:15:31.162 --> 02:15:32.884]  You're right, the ground is littered with it.
[02:15:32.884 --> 02:15:34.866]  What are these documents?
[02:15:34.866 --> 02:15:53.862]  Okay, one is called... You go into Google and you type in cryptome.org and then you have WTC7 collapse described and where it has this engineer by the name of
[02:15:54.892 --> 02:16:01.214]  He was the engineer of World Trade Center 7, named Mike Catalano.
[02:16:01.214 --> 02:16:10.736]  He was employed by a guy named Peter Molroy, who served as the head of security for Solomon Smith and Barney.
[02:16:10.736 --> 02:16:23.059]  He talked about how Silverstein had a heated exchange with one of his men on the day of 9-11.
[02:16:24.358 --> 02:16:40.248]  Uh, his name was Marty M. I don't know what his last name was, but it's Marty M. And they got in a heated exchange because he was a representative for Silverstein.
[02:16:40.248 --> 02:16:44.851]  And Silverstein was arguing with him because he said they had to get out.
[02:16:44.851 --> 02:16:46.612]  Something bad was going to happen.
[02:16:46.612 --> 02:16:47.792]  He was telling them that.
[02:16:47.792 --> 02:16:48.753]  And that Marty M.
[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:56.986]  He didn't understand why he was in the heated exchange, but eventually they ended up going.
[02:16:56.986 --> 02:17:01.730]  Is this an FBI document or what is it?
[02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:12.499]  It was actually a meeting with former head of SMUTS, Solomon Smith Barney Security.
[02:17:12.499 --> 02:17:18.424]  It was a briefing prepared by this, I believe,
[02:17:19.377 --> 02:17:20.217]  I'm not too sure.
[02:17:20.217 --> 02:17:20.598]  Declassified?
[02:17:35.293 --> 02:17:36.274]  I'm not too sure.
[02:17:36.274 --> 02:17:37.215]  He just didn't.
[02:17:37.215 --> 02:17:38.175]  I'm not so sure.
[02:17:38.175 --> 02:17:40.537]  But here's the other... I mean, Krypton's a great site.
[02:17:40.537 --> 02:17:42.458]  It's the original WikiLeaks.
[02:17:42.458 --> 02:17:46.160]  And we've had the founder of it, John Young, on quite a few times.
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:56.567]  So my point is, is I'm familiar with a lot of the stuff that already went on from witnesses that we've had on, some of which mysteriously die right after we have them on, I should add.
[02:17:56.567 --> 02:18:02.690]  But specifically, I mean, the document, if it's declassified, it will say where it was declassified from.
[02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:03.271]  I know they had
[02:18:04.739 --> 02:18:17.664]  After event interviews, you know, the FBI interviewed thousands of people, so I would imagine that's probably where this came from, but it should have a description on the document and say when it was declassified or you're saying this is a leaked document, but I'm certainly glad you called with that.
[02:18:17.664 --> 02:18:19.124]  What's the second document?
[02:18:19.124 --> 02:18:25.446]  I should search WTC7 collapse described and then add Cryptome.org into the search behind it.
[02:18:25.446 --> 02:18:25.946]  Got that?
[02:18:25.946 --> 02:18:26.887]  What's the second one?
[02:18:26.887 --> 02:18:27.827]  Quick.
[02:18:27.827 --> 02:18:33.329]  The second one, Alex, is you type in Cryptome.org and you put space
[02:18:34.215 --> 02:18:39.438]  Con Ed with a dash between Con and Ed.
[02:18:39.438 --> 02:18:40.859]  Con Ed Energy.
[02:18:40.859 --> 02:18:44.942]  It's the first document you'll see.
[02:18:44.942 --> 02:18:45.923]  Con Ed Energy.
[02:18:45.923 --> 02:18:49.505]  Now they had a generator in the building, so what do they say?
[02:18:49.505 --> 02:18:56.910]  They say that they had control of, I think, the power grid for New York Stock Exchange.
[02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:57.250]  Yes.
[02:18:57.250 --> 02:18:59.872]  In that area where Bowling Green Park is.
[02:19:03.503 --> 02:19:06.185]  All the power grid was down.
[02:19:06.185 --> 02:19:14.610]  And what's so interesting about that area is that it has been historically known for having architectural firms on that.
[02:19:14.610 --> 02:19:21.294]  So I always thought that was interesting that the power grid would be down the day architectural firms.
[02:19:21.294 --> 02:19:30.780]  I guess people, they didn't want people to know that if there was some architect representing them, they'd question why it fell like that.
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:36.023]  You're saying the power was out before the planes hit?
[02:19:36.023 --> 02:19:37.023]  No, no, no.
[02:19:37.023 --> 02:19:40.845]  They took it down during the time the planes hit, apparently.
[02:19:40.845 --> 02:19:42.386]  That's what I'm guessing.
[02:19:42.386 --> 02:19:45.528]  Oh, the document says they decided to cut the power.
[02:19:45.528 --> 02:19:46.488]  Yes.
[02:19:46.488 --> 02:19:49.310]  Alright, I'll have to look into both of those.
[02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:50.290]  Thank you so much.
[02:19:50.290 --> 02:19:53.252]  I meant to get to more calls, but Jonathan was intriguing.
[02:19:53.252 --> 02:19:57.974]  Damon, Dustery, Steve, Tim, others, your calls are straight ahead.

[02:21:05.881 --> 02:21:06.441]  The U.S.
[02:21:06.441 --> 02:21:13.726]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:21:13.726 --> 02:21:16.448]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:21:16.448 --> 02:21:19.631]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the U.S.
[02:21:19.991 --> 02:21:20.191]  I think?
[02:21:42.677 --> 02:21:43.478]  We're good.
[02:22:00.083 --> 02:22:02.984]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[02:22:02.984 --> 02:22:09.105]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.

[02:22:30.932 --> 02:22:35.495]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.495 --> 02:22:41.299]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.299 --> 02:22:44.941]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:23:02.855 --> 02:23:09.243]  In order to survive, you will soon need to produce some or all of your own food in your backyard or small farm.
[02:23:09.243 --> 02:23:18.134]  Many years ago, sought-after radio guest Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to find the easiest ways to grow food for the crisis we are now facing.
[02:23:18.354 --> 02:23:22.358]  Marjorie created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow food.
[02:23:22.358 --> 02:23:30.347]  You'll learn the most efficient gardening methods, myths and truths of orchards and edible landscaping, effective predator protection, and even home butchering.
[02:23:30.347 --> 02:23:36.794]  Everyone is talking about Marjorie's DVD, and it's highly recommended by Jim Rawls, Jack Spurko, and Bountiful Gardens.
[02:23:37.054 --> 02:23:44.422]  Read her free reports on how to have a green thumb, making free fertilizer, and answers the question, do you need a gun to garden?
[02:23:44.422 --> 02:23:54.352]  If you want the security, savings, and freedom of food self-reliance, buy Marjorie's DVD and get the free reports at BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[02:23:54.352 --> 02:23:57.416]  Again, that's BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[02:24:13.561 --> 02:24:17.082]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:24:17.082 --> 02:24:19.403]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:24:19.403 --> 02:24:20.683]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:24:20.683 --> 02:24:23.544]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:24:32.691 --> 02:24:35.773]  Down with Big Brother?
[02:24:35.773 --> 02:24:40.796]  Kind of extremist is blues legend Jimmy Vaughn.
[02:24:40.796 --> 02:24:46.759]  Let's go ahead and talk to Damon in South Carolina.
[02:24:46.759 --> 02:24:51.061]  Damon, you're on the air.
[02:25:02.503 --> 02:25:03.264]  Hey, Alex.
[02:25:03.264 --> 02:25:03.644]  Hey, buddy.
[02:25:03.644 --> 02:25:16.334]  I was just listening to Red talking, and please don't take this the wrong way, but unfortunately, I'm not as optimistic as he is, and I think that the writing is on the wall.
[02:25:16.334 --> 02:25:30.546]  When he refers to how, in history, the serfs, so to speak, have thrown off the chains of slavery and beheaded that king or had a revolution and whatnot.
[02:25:31.730 --> 02:25:41.835]  The ultimate equalizer, the firearm, was pretty much the same between the military and the average person who had a farm and a cow and two acres, you know?
[02:25:41.835 --> 02:25:48.418]  They had some cannons, but it was all pretty simplistic, you know, military against each other, as far as weapons go.
[02:25:48.418 --> 02:25:57.843]  Nowadays, I mean, you know, not that I want a violent uprising, but if it comes to that, for us to defend our rights by the Constitution with the government,
[02:25:58.757 --> 02:26:08.039]  The numbers and the technology on the government side of all the whole world, you know, China, U.S., what have you, is far outweighing to that of the people.
[02:26:08.039 --> 02:26:08.359]  All right.
[02:26:08.359 --> 02:26:10.580]  You know, here's the deal.
[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:16.181]  I've studied quite a bit of military history, guerrilla warfare, total resistance.
[02:26:16.181 --> 02:26:22.322]  I've interviewed many retired and current special forces people.
[02:26:22.322 --> 02:26:24.283]  I've studied Vietnam and other areas.
[02:26:26.198 --> 02:26:36.022]  Actually, if you have a motivated even minority that is willing to fight and die in asymmetrical warfare, they've got to park those tanks.
[02:26:36.022 --> 02:26:38.443]  They've got to park those helicopters.
[02:26:38.443 --> 02:26:41.624]  The military likes to go in bars.
[02:26:41.624 --> 02:26:47.006]  I mean, I hate to use a Hollywood example, but something like Red Dawn is actually pretty close.
[02:26:47.006 --> 02:26:49.527]  When you have the initiative to kill people,
[02:26:51.088 --> 02:26:54.011]  And they don't know when you're going to strike.
[02:26:54.011 --> 02:26:55.292]  You're completely unstoppable.
[02:26:55.292 --> 02:26:57.154]  Now, I don't even want to go that direction.
[02:26:57.154 --> 02:26:59.676]  I want to wake the military and police up.
[02:26:59.676 --> 02:27:03.540]  But the system is gearing up the military and police for the American people.
[02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:12.829]  The system's also worried that a lot of military, and we've now learned, and learned the names, that quite a few units refused to confiscate guns during that beta test in Katrina.
[02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:17.133]  And when they do these surveys, will you fire on Americans?
[02:27:17.133 --> 02:27:18.754]  The majority say no.
[02:27:18.754 --> 02:27:29.463]  That's why they signed a deal ten years ago, nine years ago, and then again three years ago, that in the Ottawa Citizen, Reuters, AP, it's in my film Road to Tyranny, to use foreign troops in America.
[02:27:29.463 --> 02:27:32.446]  People are always like, yeah, foreign troops, folks, it's official.
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:37.223]  They give speeches at West Point getting the troops ready for it.
[02:27:37.223 --> 02:27:38.544]  They want to bring foreign troops in.
[02:27:38.544 --> 02:27:39.945]  That's even better!
[02:27:39.945 --> 02:27:44.749]  Then it's really clear that this is an occupation, if it goes to that.
[02:27:44.749 --> 02:27:49.133]  Now, for people like myself, if it goes into this stuff, I'm deader than a doornail.
[02:27:50.412 --> 02:27:52.053]  Uh, but that's just the way it is.
[02:27:52.053 --> 02:27:59.256]  Uh, and I just, uh, I mean, I'm not trying to be mean to you, but have you studied, uh, Damon, asymmetrical war?
[02:27:59.256 --> 02:27:59.736]  I mean, are you?
[02:27:59.736 --> 02:28:10.441]  I mean, maybe you are, uh, from the military or from a historical, uh, uh, uh, guerrilla warfare type, uh, system.
[02:28:10.441 --> 02:28:13.142]  And perhaps you can, you can tell me where I'm wrong.
[02:28:13.142 --> 02:28:15.103]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:28:15.103 --> 02:28:18.545]  Your points are all, um, well-spoken and taken.
[02:28:19.861 --> 02:28:35.460]  Of course, but the point is this, you know, you look at Vietnam, the Viet Cong, the VC, they were being funded and supported by, you know, the Soviets, the Chinese, they had support behind them.
[02:28:36.235 --> 02:28:44.598]  The problem we have today is, first of all, to your military point, my nephew graduated from Fort Bennington in Georgia last summer.
[02:28:44.598 --> 02:28:51.080]  We have so many kids in like the 18 to 25 year olds right now that are like, they're gung-ho about getting in the military and killing people.
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:54.663]  No, they play video games, they fantasize about it, so they go and join.
[02:29:08.286 --> 02:29:10.988]  Aren't going to have a straight up guerrilla war with the American people.
[02:29:10.988 --> 02:29:13.630]  They're going to commit a bunch of atrocities.
[02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:18.973]  It's not going to be the helicopters and tanks and hellfire missiles that would beat the American people.
[02:29:18.973 --> 02:29:21.075]  It's going to be a psychological war.
[02:29:21.075 --> 02:29:24.697]  The Pentagon's on record saying 90% of war is now psychological.
[02:29:24.697 --> 02:29:27.339]  It was always part psychological.
[02:29:27.339 --> 02:29:32.603]  They're going to blow stuff up and blame it on the American resistance to win the hearts and minds of the public.
[02:29:33.163 --> 02:29:40.365]  So that's what we face, is them blowing up churches, blowing up federal buildings with daycares, blaming it on us.
[02:29:40.365 --> 02:29:43.846]  During that war, killing cops for no reason, saying we did it.
[02:29:43.846 --> 02:29:46.887]  It is not going to be them beating us militarily.
[02:29:46.887 --> 02:29:49.188]  It's going to be a cy-war fight.
[02:29:49.188 --> 02:29:51.509]  Be right back.
[02:29:51.509 --> 02:29:55.430]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.430 --> 02:29:58.111]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.124 --> 02:30:02.285]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:02.285 --> 02:30:09.228]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:09.228 --> 02:30:11.770]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:11.770 --> 02:30:17.152]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:17.152 --> 02:30:20.194]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:20.194 --> 02:30:22.255]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:22.515 --> 02:30:28.759]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:28.759 --> 02:30:32.141]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:32.141 --> 02:30:37.924]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:37.924 --> 02:30:39.565]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:39.565 --> 02:30:40.866]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:40.866 --> 02:30:43.527]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.527 --> 02:30:44.948]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:30:45.208 --> 02:30:47.550]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:02.725 --> 02:31:06.687]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.687 --> 02:31:15.550]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:20.192]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.192 --> 02:31:30.996]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.636 --> 02:31:41.162]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.162 --> 02:31:46.586]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:46.586 --> 02:31:54.071]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:54.071 --> 02:31:56.833]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:02.023 --> 02:32:06.047]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:06.047 --> 02:32:09.290]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.290 --> 02:32:14.074]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:14.074 --> 02:32:20.480]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:22.723]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.223 --> 02:32:23.543]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:23.543 --> 02:32:23.823]  Bernanke?
[02:32:23.823 --> 02:32:24.424]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:24.424 --> 02:32:25.184]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:25.184 --> 02:32:26.825]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.153 --> 02:32:46.536]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:32:46.536 --> 02:32:49.438]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:49.438 --> 02:32:58.543]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:30.516 --> 02:33:44.100]  I was just thinking, as we went live, how crazy it is that the US government, the European governments, they're raising the safe level of now what they say is safe.
[02:33:46.404 --> 02:33:51.432]  That's exactly what Dr. Chris Busby said that they would do over a month ago here on this broadcast.
[02:33:51.432 --> 02:33:57.421]  He advises the BBC, he advises the EU, very prominent researcher.
[02:34:00.452 --> 02:34:14.601]  I guess nuclear chemical engineer, Dr. Busby, we're gonna be speaking with him here in just a moment, because we're being bathed in higher and higher levels of radiation, and they're just waving that magic wand, saying, no problem.
[02:34:14.601 --> 02:34:19.204]  It's kinda like the US government admits they've just changed the ratios of unemployment.
[02:34:19.204 --> 02:34:27.009]  It's really 22 plus percent, according to every private estimate, but they say, no, we just say it's 9%, and we say inflation's 2% when it's more like 10%.
[02:34:28.791 --> 02:34:31.153]  Everybody knows there's inflation.
[02:34:31.153 --> 02:34:32.615]  It's ruled by lawyers.
[02:34:32.615 --> 02:34:38.102]  We're going to be talking to Mr. Busby, Dr. Busby, about these amazing developments in just one moment.
[02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:46.432]  First off, though, I want to tell the listeners of this radio broadcast about osteo-K.
[02:34:47.734 --> 02:34:51.597]  And it's a product the drug companies don't want you to know about.
[02:34:51.597 --> 02:35:01.365]  It's called Osteo-K, and it was created by physicians from Harvard, Cornell, MIT, and others, and backed by more than 20 years of clinical research.
[02:35:01.365 --> 02:35:10.332]  Osteo-K is an osteoporosis supplement, shown to decrease, according to the studies they have on their site, fractures by 87% without any of the dangerous side effects of medications.
[02:35:10.332 --> 02:35:14.675]  This is truly a revolution that takes the power away from big pharma,
[02:35:15.396 --> 02:35:18.199]  with all their toxic drugs and puts it in your hands.
[02:35:18.199 --> 02:35:27.527]  Friends, osteoporosis is a deadly disease, but I can tell you that the most effective approach for protecting your bones is not the drugs, it's Osteo-K.
[02:35:27.527 --> 02:35:33.452]  Check them out at nbihealth.com, that's nbihealth.com, or call 800-624-1416, 800-624-1416 today, Osteo-K.
[02:35:42.145 --> 02:35:44.986]  And finally, I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:35:44.986 --> 02:35:48.687]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:35:48.687 --> 02:35:50.808]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.

[02:36:19.419 --> 02:36:23.721]  You can also subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:23.721 --> 02:36:31.164]  What do you say to something this big, this out in the open, this naked, the hubris,
[02:36:33.087 --> 02:36:43.449]  It turns out the Japanese newspapers are reporting that, and TEPCO admits that they knew that 16 hours after earthquake was the first meltdown.
[02:36:43.449 --> 02:36:54.852]  Since then they've admitted in five of the reactors explosions, fires, partial meltdowns, some of the cores 70% exposed, others that have broken out of the chambers and fully melted into the earth.
[02:36:55.872 --> 02:37:03.500]  More explosions, more fires, more smoke, and you've got to go to the local Japanese news to even find it and watch the webcams.
[02:37:03.500 --> 02:37:07.384]  It's not even news here in the United States.
[02:37:07.384 --> 02:37:14.631]  Meanwhile, they've raised the levels of what they say is normal or safe, and some isotopes, the FDA.
[02:37:15.917 --> 02:37:20.400]  EPA has raised it 1,000 times what it previously was.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:22.102]  One isotope 100,000, others 25,000.
[02:37:22.102 --> 02:37:27.526]  We've gone through and listed off the EPA's websites, the main one, what they've done.
[02:37:27.526 --> 02:37:36.692]  The only reporting we're getting is from states, and this was a month ago, 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine, 300 times radioactive nickel.
[02:37:36.692 --> 02:37:40.755]  I mean, we've gone over the state reports, and the feds, their answer is just say, you know what?
[02:37:41.676 --> 02:37:44.037]  You could have a hundred thousand times what we previously said.
[02:37:44.037 --> 02:37:46.037]  It's magic.
[02:37:46.037 --> 02:37:51.019]  And it shows a major change in the way these systems operate.
[02:37:51.019 --> 02:37:54.140]  And that's what Dr. Busby... I mean, I've got to give him credit.
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:55.880]  He really didn't stick his neck out.
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:57.101]  He did the research.
[02:37:57.101 --> 02:37:58.701]  But some said he did at the time.
[02:37:58.701 --> 02:38:00.022]  When he went public worldwide,
[02:38:00.942 --> 02:38:02.784]  And said, look, this is already bigger than Chernobyl.
[02:38:02.784 --> 02:38:05.627]  We're talking a week or two in, a month and a half ago.
[02:38:05.627 --> 02:38:15.496]  He went public and said there has been nuclear explosions, atomic explosions there and gave examples of where that's happened before in Russia and the isotope readings and top scientists he's interviewed.
[02:38:16.496 --> 02:38:18.818]  He then said this is how they will counter it.
[02:38:18.818 --> 02:38:24.242]  They will simply raise what they say is safe because what they already say is safe isn't safe from all the studies.
[02:38:24.242 --> 02:38:29.026]  And then he talked about infertility exploding and that that perhaps is really what they're after.
[02:38:29.026 --> 02:38:36.031]  Dr. Busby is a British scientist known for his theories about the negative health effects, his theories, of very low-dose ionizing radiation.
[02:38:36.031 --> 02:38:37.552]  This is what Wikipedia says.
[02:38:37.552 --> 02:38:44.417]  Busby is the Director of Green Audit and Environmental Consultancy Agency and Scientific Advisor to the low-level radiation campaign LLRC.org.
[02:38:45.598 --> 02:38:47.859]  And he also advises the BBC and others.
[02:38:47.859 --> 02:38:48.940]  He obtained his B.S.
[02:38:48.940 --> 02:39:01.086]  in chemistry with a first class honors from the University of London and then did research at the Wellcome Foundation applying spectrographic and analytical methods to chemical, pharmacology and molecular drug interactions.
[02:39:01.086 --> 02:39:01.507]  He became
[02:39:02.447 --> 02:39:04.688]  And elected member of the Royal Society of Chemistry.
[02:39:04.688 --> 02:39:08.130]  He later gained a PhD in chemical physics.
[02:39:08.130 --> 02:39:15.413]  He's a chemical physicist at the University of Kent researching Raman spectro-electrochemistry.
[02:39:15.413 --> 02:39:18.995]  And he joins us, LLRC.org has all the documents.
[02:39:18.995 --> 02:39:21.076]  But you've been proven right in spades.
[02:39:21.076 --> 02:39:22.717]  They're now saying many times worse.
[02:39:22.717 --> 02:39:24.858]  May melt down for years.
[02:39:24.858 --> 02:39:26.639]  Building a big tent, trying to contain it.
[02:39:27.419 --> 02:39:41.270]  But it's not even, and you predicted what they would do, raising what they say is safe, even though their head scientist quit, the advisor to the president and prime minister, and said they're telling kids 12 miles away to keep living there.
[02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:44.832]  But Dr. Busby, there's the intro preface.
[02:39:44.832 --> 02:39:48.115]  You've been absolutely right, so break it down and tell us where we're going.
[02:39:48.115 --> 02:39:53.659]  I mean, next they may say uranium should be an additive in cereal to fortify children's bones.
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:55.961]  Oh, dear.
[02:39:55.961 --> 02:39:58.505]  It's all quite bizarre, I agree with you.
[02:39:58.505 --> 02:40:04.974]  Well, of course, as you say, Reactor 1 melted down, and this is now accepted, and it had melted down on Day 2.
[02:40:04.974 --> 02:40:11.063]  Of course, they're still not really telling you what's happening, and we do know now from measurements and from analysis of
[02:40:11.543 --> 02:40:12.964]  We're good to go.
[02:40:32.193 --> 02:40:32.693]  We're good to go.
[02:41:00.071 --> 02:41:00.491]  We're good to go.
[02:41:23.146 --> 02:41:23.686]  We're good to go.
[02:41:43.922 --> 02:41:44.563]  We're good to go.
[02:42:07.186 --> 02:42:07.907]  We're good to go.
[02:42:19.923 --> 02:42:20.964]  I think we're good to go.
[02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:59.477]  And not everyone will get hit by one, but if you inhale one, you're a dead duck according to the nuclear physicist and radiation doctors, scientists we've had on, that you absorb one of these with uranium or plutonium and say into your lungs, lung cancer is coming within a few years to a decade.
[02:42:59.477 --> 02:43:05.319]  It's just incredible and it's not even in the news now, but the states that are studying milk,
[02:43:05.899 --> 02:43:08.700]  Well, the trouble is you can't see this stuff.
[02:43:08.700 --> 02:43:12.542]  And, you know, if you look at the videos of people who drive into the, if you like, the exclusion zone,
[02:43:38.009 --> 02:43:39.090]  It would be quite terrifying.
[02:43:39.090 --> 02:43:44.051]  You'd be walking into a sort of radioactive inferno of color.
[02:43:44.051 --> 02:43:56.696]  I think that they have to now, in some kind of global way, provide enough resources to put something over the top of this and keep it all in.
[02:43:56.696 --> 02:44:00.017]  There has to be some containment.
[02:44:00.017 --> 02:44:03.398]  It's no longer possible to just leave it and keep raising the limits.
[02:44:03.658 --> 02:44:07.083]  What about megatons of concrete instead of a tent?
[02:44:07.083 --> 02:44:13.472]  What about building a literal pyramid of concrete on top of those?
[02:44:13.472 --> 02:44:20.361]  Yeah, I think the problem there is that you have to isolate it in some way, so you have to cool it, you see, or the reaction
[02:44:26.503 --> 02:44:33.291]  Of course you've got the earth underneath it and the groundwater so it will just produce an awful lot of stuff which will just then leak out into the ocean.
[02:44:35.963 --> 02:44:41.007]  But as they admit it's so radioactive, they keep pulling the people out and now it's very secretive.
[02:44:41.007 --> 02:44:44.750]  They're restricting media and so we have no idea even really what they're doing.
[02:45:01.728 --> 02:45:02.449]  I agree with you.
[02:45:02.449 --> 02:45:03.230]  I agree with you.
[02:45:03.230 --> 02:45:04.291]  It's a nightmare.
[02:45:04.291 --> 02:45:07.073]  And I mean, I wish I could say, do this, do that, or do the other.
[02:45:07.073 --> 02:45:11.177]  I wish I could have some kind of positive suggestion that might be useful.
[02:45:11.177 --> 02:45:12.078]  I don't really.
[02:45:12.078 --> 02:45:13.299]  It is out of control.
[02:45:13.299 --> 02:45:19.205]  And the idea that the Japanese government are somehow going to take nine months to control it just leaves me falling about laughing.
[02:45:20.266 --> 02:45:23.768]  This is a global catastrophe, and I don't have any answers.
[02:45:23.768 --> 02:45:39.218]  But I tell you one thing that I can say, and that is that the risk model that's currently being used in order to advise people about how much radiation they can be exposed to, like you said, that is being increased all the time, that is completely wrong.
[02:45:39.218 --> 02:45:45.282]  These people are going to suffer horribly as a result of their exposures, and if they don't get away from where they are now,
[02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:46.762]  Well that was my next point!
[02:46:12.987 --> 02:46:13.807]  That was my next point.
[02:46:13.807 --> 02:46:18.029]  And then I want to get into the model, because that's the big hoax and cover up here.
[02:46:18.029 --> 02:46:22.591]  But just a month or so ago, it was like, oh, they're going to cancel the reactors, the new ones in the US.
[02:46:22.591 --> 02:46:24.972]  Oh, we're going to look at these dangerous designs.
[02:46:24.972 --> 02:46:27.854]  And now it's almost like, well, that's over with.
[02:46:27.854 --> 02:46:29.594]  See, it's not a big deal when they blow up.
[02:46:29.594 --> 02:46:30.535]  Let's build more.
[02:46:30.535 --> 02:46:30.915]  It's kind of.
[02:46:31.255 --> 02:46:33.716]  Kind of fun to have one blow up in your country.
[02:46:33.716 --> 02:46:37.978]  George Monbiot, using psychological warfare, says, it's liberal and good.
[02:46:37.978 --> 02:46:39.699]  This makes me want it.
[02:46:39.699 --> 02:46:41.159]  And people say, well, that sounds crazy.
[02:46:41.159 --> 02:46:41.840]  No.
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:44.981]  They realize that a lot of the public now just goes off how you act.
[02:46:44.981 --> 02:46:49.003]  So if you dance around and say, I have cyanide pills, people will line up and take them.
[02:46:49.861 --> 02:46:51.622]  I think you're absolutely right.
[02:46:51.622 --> 02:47:01.150]  I think there is some kind of magical process taking place here akin to the Emperor's New Clothes, if you recall.
[02:47:01.150 --> 02:47:10.357]  They're presenting something which is balmy, and people are swallowing it merely because it's been presented again and again and again and again like some sort of cracked record.
[02:47:10.357 --> 02:47:19.244]  And of course they're not telling us the truth about these materials that are coming out, and they're not even releasing the results of measurements in Europe anymore.
[02:47:19.244 --> 02:47:19.804]  We're having
[02:47:19.844 --> 02:47:27.715]  We're going to use Freedom of Information Act and questions in Parliament to try and get out the data to see what's happening over here or even make the measurements ourselves.
[02:47:31.505 --> 02:47:32.246]  It's a cover-up.
[02:47:32.246 --> 02:47:34.528]  It's a scary business.
[02:47:34.528 --> 02:47:35.909]  It's a scary business.
[02:47:35.909 --> 02:47:37.870]  But I mean, it's not the only cover-up.
[02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:41.854]  I mean, the world at the moment is in a very bizarre state altogether.
[02:47:41.854 --> 02:47:44.116]  Not just from the point of view of Fukushima.
[02:47:44.116 --> 02:47:47.819]  No, we've now had leaks in Canada and in the U.S.
[02:47:47.819 --> 02:47:51.021]  and now because of Fukushima, it's not even an event.
[02:47:51.021 --> 02:47:53.884]  They say, yeah, we released all this radiation in the lake.
[02:47:53.884 --> 02:47:55.785]  Keep eating the fish, it's fine.
[02:47:55.785 --> 02:47:58.528]  It's almost like it's gotten to the point now where it's passé and
[02:48:01.039 --> 02:48:04.021]  I mean, society's really gotten in a trance-like state.
[02:48:04.021 --> 02:48:15.506]  Dr. Busby, break down the models, because as you said a month and a half ago here, you said the model of what they say is safe isn't safe, but you watch they'll raise the levels.
[02:48:15.506 --> 02:48:24.110]  And so even if we go by their old model that, okay, this is a safe level, how can they then get away with saying, well, now we're going to raise what is safe?
[02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:28.412]  I mean, that is just on its face utterly asinine, but they're doing it.
[02:48:29.045 --> 02:48:30.746]  Well, this is how they do it.
[02:48:30.746 --> 02:48:38.231]  The model that they use is based on external radiation, micro-sieverts per hour, if you like, or overall dose.
[02:48:38.231 --> 02:48:41.513]  So if you have like 10 hours, it's 10 micro-sieverts.
[02:48:41.513 --> 02:48:45.856]  And the model is based on the survivors of the Hiroshima bomb.
[02:48:45.856 --> 02:48:52.721]  So what they do is they say that the Hiroshima bomb survivors received so many sieverts of radiation, which is like a huge dose.
[02:48:52.721 --> 02:48:57.844]  And then we followed them for most of their life, and we found this number of cancers.
[02:48:57.844 --> 02:48:58.965]  So we say that this number
[02:48:59.005 --> 02:48:59.685]  We're good to go.
[02:49:25.285 --> 02:49:25.605]  We're good to go.
[02:49:49.676 --> 02:49:50.136]  We're good to go.
[02:50:16.218 --> 02:50:17.298]  Well that's like saying...
[02:50:38.227 --> 02:50:55.956]  Absolutely, and that's exactly what Dr. Doug Rocky, who was the head of the Pentagon's radiation study program with DU, explains, is that it's the inhaling of it, and then it just sits there at point-blank range for the rest of your life, frying the cells around it, and you get a cancer right there.
[02:50:55.956 --> 02:51:01.738]  And they're just saying, it's fine, it's wonderful, ah, 100,000 times levels better!
[02:51:01.738 --> 02:51:04.520]  Will I have garlic breath after I take LEC?
[02:51:05.083 --> 02:51:18.295]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C. And the answer is, Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[02:51:18.295 --> 02:51:25.281]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:51:25.541 --> 02:51:29.685]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[02:51:29.685 --> 02:51:33.790]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[02:51:33.790 --> 02:51:40.657]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal and viral infections and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:51:40.657 --> 02:51:42.759]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[02:51:42.759 --> 02:51:45.702]  Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[02:51:46.022 --> 02:51:51.188]  Ali C. For more information and to order Ali C., call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:51:51.188 --> 02:51:53.290]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:51:53.290 --> 02:51:54.091]  Fight back with Ali C.
[02:52:00.919 --> 02:52:02.720]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:18.292]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[02:52:18.292 --> 02:52:18.632]  dollar.
[02:52:18.632 --> 02:52:28.339]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[02:52:28.339 --> 02:52:29.300]  economy and inflation.
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:39.635]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[02:52:39.635 --> 02:52:45.223]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[02:52:46.024 --> 02:52:55.490]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[02:52:55.490 --> 02:53:00.434]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:53:01.081 --> 02:53:03.663]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[02:53:03.663 --> 02:53:04.343]  No kidding!
[02:53:04.343 --> 02:53:08.726]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[02:53:08.726 --> 02:53:11.487]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[02:53:11.487 --> 02:53:14.949]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[02:53:14.949 --> 02:53:19.972]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[02:53:19.972 --> 02:53:26.897]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[02:53:26.897 --> 02:53:30.779]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[02:53:30.899 --> 02:53:33.019]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[02:53:33.019 --> 02:53:34.380]  Fit standard mason jars.
[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:35.820]  Are indefinitely reusable.
[02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:37.760]  And are proudly made in the USA.
[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:39.881]  Place orders at ReusableCanningLids.com or call 1-877-747-2793.
[02:53:39.881 --> 02:53:39.941]  877-747-2793.
[02:53:39.941 --> 02:53:40.341]  Call 877-747-2793.
[02:53:40.341 --> 02:53:41.261]  Or go to ReusableCanningLids.com.
[02:53:41.261 --> 02:53:43.582]  That's ReusableCanningLids.com for Tadler Reusable Canning Lids.
[02:53:43.582 --> 02:53:44.622]  The original since 1976.
[02:54:22.602 --> 02:54:24.524]  We'll be watching you, Globalist.
[02:54:24.524 --> 02:54:28.989]  They knew day one, within the second day, that there'd been a total meltdown.
[02:54:28.989 --> 02:54:31.372]  They know there's been all sorts of fission going on.
[02:54:31.372 --> 02:54:38.039]  I've seen them admit that, and the way Dr. Busby describes it, and other physicists we've talked to, that there are these little atomic explosions.
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:39.060]  I think.
[02:54:58.473 --> 02:54:59.073]  Yes, correct.
[02:54:59.073 --> 02:55:04.336]  There's no doubt that it dwarfs Chernobyl, and the cancer yield from this is going to be greater than the cancer yield from Chernobyl.
[02:55:04.336 --> 02:55:08.738]  Chernobyl was at least a million people, and we're going to have a larger number than this.
[02:55:10.482 --> 02:55:16.465]  And I guess the nuclear industry is hoping we just forget about it so they can build more of these things.
[02:55:16.465 --> 02:55:22.948]  When you got cut off by the break, you were explaining what these radioactive particles do when they get in the lungs or other tissue.
[02:55:22.948 --> 02:55:30.692]  Yeah, I was describing the effect of a particle which we have actually discovered and identified from Fukushima in an air filter.
[02:55:30.692 --> 02:55:35.234]  It's a particle containing isotope americium-241, which is an alpha
[02:55:39.548 --> 02:55:40.088]  I don't know.
[02:55:58.504 --> 02:56:00.605]  Did we just lose Dr. Busby?
[02:56:25.950 --> 02:56:27.771]  That was weird.
[02:56:27.771 --> 02:56:28.772]  Let's get him back on the line.
[02:56:28.772 --> 02:56:30.413]  We'll do five minutes overdrive if we have to.
[02:56:30.413 --> 02:56:32.615]  We've got to get his testimony on record here.
[02:56:32.615 --> 02:56:36.597]  Folks, this guy's been 100% on target.
[02:56:36.597 --> 02:56:48.846]  I was having him on a month and a half ago and he was laying all of this out and people are like, oh, there hadn't been multiple meltdowns.
[02:56:48.846 --> 02:56:49.866]  Oh, there's no problem.
[02:56:49.866 --> 02:56:51.788]  And now it's all admitted.
[02:56:51.788 --> 02:56:52.868]  In fact, it's worse.
[02:56:53.752 --> 02:56:56.573]  Then we had said TEPCO's admitting it.
[02:56:56.573 --> 02:57:03.336]  Weeks ago, the head advisor to the Japanese government quit saying it's immoral to have kids still in the area.
[02:57:03.336 --> 02:57:06.757]  We'll have to hold Dr. Busby five minutes to the next hour.
[02:57:06.757 --> 02:57:07.778]  Doc, you got cut off.
[02:57:07.778 --> 02:57:12.760]  You were breaking down how many particles this thing shoots out.
[02:57:13.732 --> 02:57:16.216]  Um, oh well I don't, I don't know how many particles there will be.
[02:57:16.216 --> 02:57:19.220]  Certainly, I mean, I have no, I haven't done the calculator.
[02:57:19.220 --> 02:57:21.363]  You're saying every second it's firing something.
[02:57:21.363 --> 02:57:23.245]  Millions of these particles.
[02:57:23.245 --> 02:57:25.909]  More than billions of these particles.
[02:57:25.909 --> 02:57:28.933]  I think probably there's going to be at least a million of these particles for
[02:57:28.933 --> 02:57:29.814]  We're good to go.
[02:57:57.372 --> 02:57:59.673]  What's the danger of these reaching, say, Texas, my little children?
[02:57:59.673 --> 02:58:02.314]  Yes, there is a danger of them reaching Texas.
[02:58:02.314 --> 02:58:04.214]  I mean, this stuff will go around the globe, unless it's contained.
[02:58:04.214 --> 02:58:05.555]  I mean, even now, it already is probably in Texas.
[02:58:24.121 --> 02:58:34.285]  But of course, the probability that they inhale it will be proportional to the number of particles in the per cubic meter, and that will be a lot less in Texas than it is in Japan.
[02:58:34.285 --> 02:58:35.046]  Dr. Busby!
[02:58:35.046 --> 02:58:37.827]  We've certainly found these in Hawaii.
[02:58:37.827 --> 02:58:38.287]  Now, I hear you.
[02:58:38.287 --> 02:58:39.107]  We gotta break.
[02:58:39.107 --> 02:58:39.608]  We gotta break.
[02:58:39.608 --> 02:58:39.928]  Stay there.
[02:58:39.928 --> 02:58:43.829]  We'll be back in one minute.
[02:58:43.829 --> 02:58:47.251]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.251 --> 02:58:49.452]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.308 --> 02:58:55.852]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.852 --> 02:58:56.752]  Number 1.
[02:58:56.752 --> 02:59:00.195]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.195 --> 02:59:01.056]  Number 2.
[02:59:01.056 --> 02:59:05.939]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.939 --> 02:59:06.680]  It's true.
[02:59:06.680 --> 02:59:11.564]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.564 --> 02:59:12.384]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.384 --> 02:59:15.967]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.967 --> 02:59:19.650]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.870 --> 02:59:20.670]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.670 --> 02:59:23.431]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.431 --> 02:59:27.112]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.112 --> 02:59:27.892]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.892 --> 02:59:32.033]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.033 --> 02:59:37.095]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.095 --> 02:59:41.276]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.276 --> 02:59:43.057]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:43.057 --> 02:59:47.658]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:59:47.978 --> 02:59:48.238]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:48.238 --> 02:59:53.760]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:55.801]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.801 --> 02:59:59.143]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.143 --> 03:00:03.704]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[03:00:03.704 --> 03:00:07.946]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[03:00:07.946 --> 03:00:09.767]  You're the pretender.
[03:00:09.767 --> 03:00:10.107]  What if I...
[03:00:25.609 --> 03:00:29.732]  Dr. Chris Busby, who has been 100% dead on.
[03:00:29.732 --> 03:00:34.395]  In fact, if he's wrong, it's that it was even worse than he said.
[03:00:34.395 --> 03:00:36.497]  And he predicted everything they would do.
[03:00:36.497 --> 03:00:39.079]  He predicted exactly what would continue to happen.
[03:00:39.079 --> 03:00:43.582]  He said, just a few weeks into it, this thing could go for a year or more.
[03:00:43.582 --> 03:00:47.204]  A month later, they came out and Tepco now admits it.
[03:00:47.204 --> 03:00:50.287]  And we were talking about these particles and yes, Texas,
[03:00:51.317 --> 03:01:00.428]  Basically every state that's tested has found elevated levels of different isotopes in milk, in surface produce like cabbage and lettuce.
[03:01:02.947 --> 03:01:03.247]  Thanks for
[03:01:23.624 --> 03:01:26.228]  We've only got about two or three minutes left, Dr. Busby.
[03:01:26.228 --> 03:01:34.820]  You got cut off with talking about it's been found in Hawaii, and we know that the Northern Hemisphere has twice the radiation of the Southern, just from Chernobyl.
[03:01:34.820 --> 03:01:39.387]  I mean, how long is this going to be going on, and what do you think the overall health effects will be?
[03:01:39.969 --> 03:01:43.231]  I think the overall health effects will be very bad in Japan.
[03:01:43.231 --> 03:01:48.455]  I don't think the overall health effects will be quite so bad in the United States and in Europe.
[03:01:48.455 --> 03:01:59.042]  And I think the reason is because, well because there's a very long way downwind of Japan and there'll be a dilution of these particles, but make no mistake, these particles are already there.
[03:01:59.042 --> 03:02:02.524]  And so long as these fissions take, this fissioning takes
[03:02:03.004 --> 03:02:03.524]  We're good to go.
[03:02:24.538 --> 03:02:25.880]  Yes, exactly.
[03:02:25.880 --> 03:02:31.165]  I think it's the only way that they can deal with it now, is that they can put a dome over it.
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:47.040]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:03:04.428 --> 03:03:04.949]  I don't think so.
[03:03:21.832 --> 03:03:22.593]  Well, it's always.
[03:03:22.593 --> 03:03:24.676]  It's the inhalation of the fallout.
[03:03:24.676 --> 03:03:26.558]  It's not just the overall background.
[03:03:26.558 --> 03:03:31.986]  That's why they have detectors that are showing normal level and a little particle goes by and it goes off the chart.
[03:03:31.986 --> 03:03:34.149]  That's why we're seeing a lot of those reports.
[03:03:34.149 --> 03:03:36.813]  It's this Russian roulette of these particles.
[03:03:37.173 --> 03:03:37.873]  You're right.
[03:03:37.873 --> 03:03:40.574]  It's the inhalation dose that is the problem.
[03:03:40.574 --> 03:03:41.134]  Absolutely.
[03:03:41.134 --> 03:03:47.417]  Because that's not properly modeled by the ICRP, by the model that they're using in order to limit people's exposure.
[03:03:47.417 --> 03:03:53.819]  You have to use the model of the European Committee on Radiation Risk, which accurately quantifies the health risk of exposure to these particles.
[03:03:55.051 --> 03:04:07.341]  Well, you've done a great job, and obviously they want this story to go away, so they don't even have to even fix anything, and some of their policy people are just let it melt down forever, and that's just the way it is.
[03:04:07.341 --> 03:04:08.922]  It's not going to go away, Alex.
[03:04:08.922 --> 03:04:10.063]  It's not going to go away.
[03:04:10.063 --> 03:04:20.011]  People are going to die, and it's going to become perfectly obvious that this is happening, so the people who are saying this are going to have to keep their fingers crossed and run like hell before these people who are dying come and get them.
[03:04:20.151 --> 03:04:25.433]  Yeah, what do you think is going to happen to Mombiot and others when the radiation... Well, I think that Mombiot shot himself in the foot.
[03:04:25.433 --> 03:04:27.294]  Very few people believe him here.
[03:04:27.294 --> 03:04:34.717]  I mean, I've heard from many, many people in the Green Movement that his credibility has been completely exploded as a result of what he's done.
[03:04:36.741 --> 03:04:39.402]  Well, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:04:39.402 --> 03:04:48.205]  That's Dr. Chris Busby, and you can check out the key research and scientific facts at LLRC.org.
[03:04:48.205 --> 03:04:50.146]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, doctor.
[03:04:50.146 --> 03:04:52.187]  Okay.
[03:04:52.187 --> 03:04:52.807]  There he goes.
[03:04:52.807 --> 03:04:54.327]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:54.327 --> 03:04:59.129]  Key retransmission coming up now, the big news blitz, and then Red Beckman.
[03:04:59.129 --> 03:05:00.009]  Great job with the crew.
[03:05:00.009 --> 03:05:01.210]  See you back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
