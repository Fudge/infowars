[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:38.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.200 --> 00:47.480]  thank you for joining us my friends it is Wednesday the 18th day of May 2011
[00:47.480 --> 00:51.320]  we're gonna be live here for at least the next three hours today Dr. Chris
[00:51.320 --> 00:56.680]  Busbee is going to be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour he of
[00:56.680 --> 01:00.760]  course months ago here just a few weeks into the disaster so this is already
[01:00.760 --> 01:05.440]  bigger than Chernobyl and they've had at least partial meltdowns that's all
[01:05.440 --> 01:11.760]  since been confirmed and now this disaster is admittedly much worse than
[01:11.760 --> 01:19.880]  what happened in the mid 1980s 1986 at Chernobyl and it's not even really in
[01:19.880 --> 01:24.640]  the newspapers anymore and there's no discussion about Japanese children not
[01:24.640 --> 01:29.680]  drinking milk from Japan or not catching fish from the sea there's our
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.480]  government isn't testing any of the food coming from Japan they're not
[01:33.480 --> 01:36.600]  testing air travelers that are coming over here after they first tested them
[01:36.600 --> 01:40.760]  just a week into it and found they were coming in with radiation all over them
[01:40.760 --> 01:47.720]  it's just incredible it's this new globalist policy of well it's like 20
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.440]  years ago they started having the trips used to play uranium before that they
[01:51.440 --> 01:57.360]  wouldn't let trips use it because whether it's a 308 round or a round
[01:57.360 --> 02:05.880]  fired from an Abrams tank cannon it ignites in the barrel and when you open
[02:05.880 --> 02:09.480]  the breach some of it comes out on you and it also fires out the front of the
[02:09.480 --> 02:13.920]  vehicle and then basically puts a patina of dust on the Bradley fighting
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.720]  vehicle the warrior fighting vehicle the Abrams the Abrams M1A and the 50
[02:18.720 --> 02:24.800]  cowl on top of a Humvee they're using them at proving grounds at every
[02:24.800 --> 02:29.320]  major military base now there's just zero controls before it was locked up in
[02:29.320 --> 02:35.840]  case of just absolute nuclear war with the Russians 10 to 1 superiority heavy
[02:35.840 --> 02:42.520]  armor rolling across into Germany out of Eastern Europe it was for ground troops
[02:42.520 --> 02:48.680]  once you're already completely radiated just as a backup weapon the Russians
[02:48.680 --> 02:52.800]  wouldn't even use it they thought it was it was so so evil now it's just used
[02:52.800 --> 02:57.520]  it everywhere I was will bathe in it I mean that's the same thing now the
[02:57.520 --> 03:03.040]  radiation what was it a month ago the EPA just waved a magic wand and put the
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.120]  public comment period up as if they care what we say that they were going to
[03:08.120 --> 03:12.360]  raise what they say as a safe levels and I really haven't covered Fukushima
[03:12.360 --> 03:21.880]  enough it is such a big deal and it goes to the underlying issue of the
[03:21.880 --> 03:27.040]  philosophy of the culture we're living in there's a full breakneck move to build
[03:27.040 --> 03:33.680]  more reactors in the U.S. there's a full break net move to let Tokyo electric
[03:33.680 --> 03:36.520]  build reactors in Texas first they were saying it was going to be canceled now
[03:36.520 --> 03:44.000]  it's not there's 36 level 4 bio weapons labs under bio shield under Bush and
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.720]  Obama's continuing it and they they go to existing facilities like the University
[03:48.720 --> 03:57.920]  of Texas at Galveston in a hurricane ravaged area I mean Galveston routinely
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.680]  gets in the last hundred years what twice has been completely wiped off the
[04:02.680 --> 04:09.680]  map and just a few years ago much of it got destroyed and devastated it was 10
[04:09.680 --> 04:15.080]  feet of water over many areas of the city they have a level for bio weapons
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.840]  development lab and the name of bio research in a level two containment
[04:19.840 --> 04:23.800]  facility just just just down there and Galveston's right down the road from
[04:23.800 --> 04:30.120]  from Houston six plus million people Metro and they've they're building them
[04:30.120 --> 04:33.040]  everywhere they're gonna build another one in San Antonio obviously I'm
[04:33.040 --> 04:41.840]  focusing on areas around me but 36 of them and it just it goes to the mindset
[04:41.840 --> 04:45.080]  of these people and meanwhile they're saying we got to stick our hands down
[04:45.080 --> 04:49.360]  your pants because terrorists might get you we got a whole baby diapers off and
[04:49.360 --> 04:54.600]  then meanwhile every terrorist that we've had as a attack since 9-11 has been
[04:54.600 --> 05:00.560]  funded and run by our own intelligence networks I mean it's insane it could
[05:00.560 --> 05:04.160]  never happen in America but it's happening right now gas prices are
[05:04.160 --> 05:08.200]  exploding past the incomes of millions of families as gas prices and crop
[05:08.200 --> 05:11.760]  failures push high food cost you can still get the best food on the planet

[08:08.960 --> 08:23.200]  in response to the intensifying attacks by MSNBC CBS 60 minutes countless other
[08:23.200 --> 08:30.800]  newspaper articles just an all-out assault against a wide spectrum a diverse
[08:30.800 --> 08:35.480]  spectrum of people that know that the federal government's out of control that
[08:35.480 --> 08:39.800]  state governments are out of control that they're breaking our Constitution and
[08:39.800 --> 08:48.000]  Bill of Rights every day that the system is religiously prosecuting a full-out
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.720]  war against every basic liberty and freedom and praising torture and secret
[08:54.720 --> 09:00.080]  arrest if you criticize any of that you're demonized and we have the
[09:00.080 --> 09:06.560]  internal video training we have many internal videos we've we've put clips
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.080]  of it on the web of them training police at anybody taking photos anywhere even
[09:11.080 --> 09:14.040]  the Statue of Liberty it's a terrorist get their name put them in a terror
[09:14.040 --> 09:19.760]  database head federal marshal in Denver a few years ago went public and said
[09:19.760 --> 09:23.200]  we're ordered every day to put innocent people on databases little kid takes a
[09:23.200 --> 09:26.640]  photo with a camera at the airport boom they're in it you order a special meal
[09:26.640 --> 09:30.640]  on the airplane you ask for vegetarian it happens it's all about creating a
[09:30.640 --> 09:37.440]  system where we are seen as terrorist and it's all illegitimate and there is a
[09:37.440 --> 09:48.840]  wide spectrum a continuum of people awakening to what's happening and they're
[09:48.840 --> 09:53.800]  being demonized shall we have one of the founders or great-granddaddies of the
[09:53.800 --> 10:01.240]  sovereign citizen movement red Beckman joining us today we had Alfred a
[10:01.240 --> 10:05.760]  desk on yesterday definitely gonna have him back but very impressive
[10:05.760 --> 10:09.080]  information I've read his work for years don't know why I've never had him on
[10:09.080 --> 10:13.680]  the show I believe he's called in a few times though but had the Alfred a desk
[10:13.680 --> 10:16.920]  on yesterday red Beckman is gonna be joining us coming up in the next hour
[10:16.920 --> 10:21.520]  and then we'll in the last 30 minutes of the third hour have a dr. Christopher
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.800]  Busby on TEPCO says nuclear meltdown occurred 16 hours after earthquake more
[10:26.800 --> 10:34.600]  on the way yeah they got hit on that Friday and then the radiation level
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.120]  went way up and there was a meltdown a partial meltdown and then that reactor
[10:39.120 --> 10:45.080]  blew up Saturday morning reactor one and then on the Monday a day and a half
[10:45.080 --> 10:50.720]  later the reactor three that's a plutonium reactor box mark one general
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.760]  electric 40 year old design it blew up sky high and they're now confirming that
[10:55.760 --> 11:01.680]  there are meltdowns at five probably complete meltdowns at two to three fuel
[11:01.680 --> 11:05.440]  rods ejected hundreds of thousands of them upwards of a mile and a half away
[11:05.440 --> 11:10.640]  the Japanese just buried them on site going right into the water levels of
[11:10.640 --> 11:15.200]  radiation thousands and thousands of times safe level picked up within two
[11:15.200 --> 11:21.720]  weeks in the water radiation levels so high that ion beams are visible at night
[11:21.720 --> 11:24.920]  and devices are picking them up many miles away I mean I mean that's
[11:24.920 --> 11:31.280]  radiation so deadly the there are reported people dying but with the
[11:31.280 --> 11:35.840]  background of 40 plus thousand different tsunami it's basically just in local
[11:35.840 --> 11:41.160]  Japanese newspapers and we've had the head engineer at the plant quit and go
[11:41.160 --> 11:44.440]  public we've had the chief advisor to the prime minister and president go
[11:44.440 --> 11:48.400]  public and say that the deaths are being covered up and the radiation levels
[11:48.400 --> 11:52.240]  are being covered up and that the government shouldn't tell schools just
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.240]  12 kilometers away to continue operating and have children playing outside
[11:56.240 --> 12:01.800]  there is no checking of milk fish or anything in the US by the feds there is
[12:01.800 --> 12:07.320]  no attempt to even look at it many state governments 20 plus last time I
[12:07.320 --> 12:10.680]  checked I think I've got to continue just to research it because if there's
[12:10.680 --> 12:17.040]  almost no news on it now states came out less than a month into this now weeks
[12:17.040 --> 12:23.640]  ago and reported high levels in milk produce because the radiation continues
[12:23.640 --> 12:29.240]  to drift over and build up we're now several months into this in fact what
[12:29.240 --> 12:35.240]  are you guys looking up for me the date and just give me a date count well I
[12:35.240 --> 12:44.040]  guess it happened on March 11th March April May so yeah we're talking to two
[12:44.040 --> 12:50.280]  months into it I remember March 11th so it's it's now May 18th that's over two
[12:50.280 --> 12:54.480]  months so on my dead reckoning is correct two plus months into this and the
[12:54.480 --> 12:58.720]  fires are intensifying the smoke is intensifying their answer they
[12:58.720 --> 13:02.320]  announced last week is to because that's who builds the biggest tents in the
[13:02.320 --> 13:07.560]  world are circus tent companies they're gonna erect circus tents over it and
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.280]  they say that's to keep the radiation from dispersing and and and it will keep
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.680]  some of the particulate from rising in the atmosphere but it's still going to
[13:17.680 --> 13:20.920]  basically leak out they did studies back in the 50s with plutonium and
[13:20.920 --> 13:28.080]  uranium with the mousetrap and the the room full of mousetraps and a ping-pong
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.080]  ball and they throw it in with the tiny amount of uranium or plutonium and then
[13:33.080 --> 13:37.440]  they do a test afterwards and the entire room and the hundreds of mousetraps all
[13:37.440 --> 13:42.880]  are radioactive so see one little particle gets out and it bumps into some
[13:42.880 --> 13:46.560]  seaweed that floats over and the fish eats it and then another fish eats that
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.640]  fish and then you eat it later or it a spot or a little bit of it gets on a
[13:50.640 --> 13:54.920]  cobweb that gets picked up by the atmosphere and you know cobwebs circle
[13:54.920 --> 13:59.360]  the earth universities go up and do studies with a big scoop on a plane and
[13:59.360 --> 14:05.040]  there's bug parts spider webs a lot of spiders deliver themselves when they
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.640]  hatch out of eggs with a spinnerette like a parachute on their tail they kind of
[14:08.640 --> 14:12.640]  hang glide and they pick up all but mainly spiders are in the atmosphere and
[14:12.640 --> 14:17.680]  and hair and cotton particles and potash the point is that stuff's just
[14:17.680 --> 14:22.240]  circling the globe just from Chernobyl in 86 the northern hemisphere of the
[14:22.240 --> 14:28.760]  planet has double the radiation level it had previously double from just
[14:28.760 --> 14:32.560]  Chernobyl and and and we get those numbers and they tracked it and in
[14:32.560 --> 14:36.640]  Europe in northern Europe southern Europe western Europe eastern Europe for
[14:36.640 --> 14:41.720]  at least six months they tested the food and they brought the milk in powdered
[14:41.720 --> 14:47.000]  from the United States and other nations that weren't in that area they they the
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.320]  school children for at least six months ate frozen food and they just had to
[14:52.320 --> 14:58.000]  basically kill the livestock and let the crops lay fallow that there's not even
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.840]  a discussion about this Chernobyl was the equivalent according to the
[15:02.840 --> 15:12.360]  International Atomic Energy Agency of 400 heresimus 400 because a reactor
[15:12.360 --> 15:17.680]  meltdown is so dirty and now we learn of five of the six have had partial or
[15:17.680 --> 15:20.600]  complete meltdowns the Japanese are being very secretive but they now admit
[15:20.600 --> 15:27.080]  this reactor 70% this 150 then we hear total meltdown later and it was over a
[15:27.080 --> 15:31.440]  month ago that one of the reactors what three melted completely out of the
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.840]  containment and and and and boiled out and burned through the concrete floor
[15:35.840 --> 15:45.960]  and is just smoking 644 thousand spent fuel rods stored at Fukushima and it is
[15:45.960 --> 15:52.880]  just mind boggling mind boggling that this is not in our news anymore it is
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.640]  last Monday not this money but last Monday there's a webcam for Japanese
[15:57.640 --> 16:01.080]  TV there and it showed smoke and what looked like explosions going off at
[16:01.080 --> 16:04.720]  night and turned out that was true three or four days later was just a minor
[16:04.720 --> 16:09.160]  foot on us some more fires and explosions we're gonna build a tent around it
[16:09.160 --> 16:14.960]  ostensibly to stop the radioactive particles to reduce it but guaranteed
[16:14.960 --> 16:18.160]  that's just so people don't look at it blowing up and smoking and again they
[16:18.160 --> 16:21.800]  said it might be nine months a year two years five years it might just it might
[16:21.800 --> 16:27.480]  just be this belching thing on the northeastern coast of Japan with the trade
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.560]  winds blowing right into us for the foreseeable future and that's why the
[16:32.560 --> 16:38.560]  environmental protection agency has come out and I saw some rulings by the FDA
[16:38.560 --> 16:41.520]  Food Drug Administration as well saying yes we're gonna follow the new guidelines
[16:41.520 --> 16:45.960]  this isotope can be a thousand times more and this one can be a hundred
[16:45.960 --> 16:54.280]  thousand more and what because they say so out of sight out of mind and this
[16:54.280 --> 17:01.360]  isn't this isn't the end of it okay let me just read we're gonna see if I can do
[17:01.360 --> 17:04.960]  this never can but let's just see if I can just read you the headlines before I
[17:04.960 --> 17:09.760]  come back and go into them I think out of everything I've got here this really
[17:09.760 --> 17:15.680]  mates up with all the police state news I covered yesterday and Supreme Court
[17:15.680 --> 17:20.800]  ruling federally Indiana Supreme Court ruling and the state of Indiana that
[17:20.800 --> 17:25.440]  there is no Fourth Amendment for any reason including no reason at all we're
[17:25.440 --> 17:31.800]  coming in your house remember the Patriot Act what is it section 213 this is
[17:31.800 --> 17:38.640]  out of KOAT television Albuquerque New Mexico delayed notice search warrants
[17:38.640 --> 17:41.640]  increasing and there's one little line here I'm gonna get you later while
[17:41.640 --> 17:45.520]  billed as an anti-terror tool a sneak and peak warrant has no requirements on
[17:45.520 --> 17:51.040]  it that it precluded from being used in standard criminal investigations and they
[17:51.040 --> 17:55.640]  want to say that most of them are being used in non-terror related and these are
[17:55.640 --> 18:02.920]  Soviet style where they you know the men in black come into your house and just

[24:34.200 --> 24:40.160]  general public is disconnected from reality up at the Drudge report they've
[24:40.160 --> 24:48.200]  got a link to a Daily Mail article that's got late 30s early 40s depression
[24:48.200 --> 24:53.920]  color photos and you look at how grounded and focused these people are
[24:53.920 --> 25:00.440]  because as Victor Hugo says adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters and
[25:00.440 --> 25:08.800]  you look into the eyes of this little black kid these families in a living
[25:08.800 --> 25:17.560]  outdoors getting some food little kids fishing for their dinner in Shriver
[25:17.560 --> 25:26.280]  Louisiana it looks like something out of the 1800s just amazing color photos of
[25:26.280 --> 25:34.280]  these really hard-working people and what they were going through and then after
[25:34.280 --> 25:38.080]  the war we had this huge industrial base people got wealth that they'd never
[25:38.080 --> 25:43.000]  imagined and they said man this government's great we can trust whatever
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.200]  they say and so America went completely to sleep and forgot how this country was
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.920]  founded how this country was built up and this country was extremely wealthy
[25:52.920 --> 25:58.720]  and had a 10% on average growth rate economically from its founding right
[25:58.720 --> 26:06.000]  through to 1913 and then the private Federal Reserve immediately set up a
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.120]  banking panic and put out a lot of hot money into the public and then restricted
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.800]  that money and imploded the economy and had one of the greatest wealth
[26:15.800 --> 26:22.400]  transfers in history and then they came back after World War two and basically
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.720]  reactivated the economy that had been built up during World War two and
[26:26.720 --> 26:42.920]  people basically gave up the basic bedrock code that is liberty that is
[26:42.920 --> 26:46.880]  freedom that made the United States the apple of the world's eye the country
[26:46.880 --> 26:49.920]  where you had real property rights the country where you could be armed to
[26:49.920 --> 26:53.680]  protect yourself from thugs and government a country where you had true
[26:53.680 --> 26:57.960]  free speech and a policeman wouldn't dare think to come to you on a soapbox on
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.680]  a street corner and tell you had to have a permit a country where the police
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.520]  wouldn't dare break in your house and plant things on you a country where the
[27:06.520 --> 27:10.560]  police wouldn't dare come in your house without a warrant a country where the
[27:10.560 --> 27:16.240]  police wouldn't dare ask for an ID much less stick their hands down your pants
[27:16.240 --> 27:19.760]  alright we're gonna go to break the next long segment get into all this news
[27:19.760 --> 27:25.520]  but here's the headlines warrants let agents enter homes without owner knowing

[27:50.520 --> 27:57.680]  Talitarian police states are built and I want to try to go over some of so that's
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.200]  just some of the news we're gonna cover on that front with the TEPCO situation
[28:01.200 --> 28:04.200]  I've already talked about that quite a bit the TEPCO nuclear meltdown occurred
[28:04.200 --> 28:08.960]  16 hours after earthquake more on the way and they knew the whole time and
[28:08.960 --> 28:12.360]  we're lying because they knew it had a lot of attention on it then if they just
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.760]  lied about it at the time then it could come out later because people would be
[28:16.760 --> 28:22.480]  moving on to the next big issue. Here's another one Fukushima reactors are
[28:22.480 --> 28:26.440]  raging nuclear inferno Kurt Nemo that he's got links to all the Japanese
[28:26.440 --> 28:32.720]  press releases. All right continuing here's the big news Pakistan China

[28:37.920 --> 28:42.080]  that was coming up yesterday they are openly running to China and Russia
[28:42.080 --> 28:47.000]  Pakistan has not been friends with China and Russia they do not like communist
[28:47.000 --> 28:53.040]  folks and we're traditionally been our ally and of course the U.S. has got
[28:53.040 --> 28:56.760]  drones bombing everywhere they've asked the U.S. to stop it they our government
[28:56.760 --> 29:03.120]  won't that is the bankers that run the U.S. I should be clear and they've had
[29:03.120 --> 29:08.520]  multiple helicopter incursions where they just attack emplacements military
[29:08.520 --> 29:14.280]  and placements in the Pakistan military and they're saying please help us and
[29:14.280 --> 29:18.080]  Pakistan saying it be fly aircraft in here we're gonna open fire on them and
[29:18.080 --> 29:22.080]  the U.S. people running our country say they're gonna continue it so they're
[29:22.080 --> 29:25.740]  trying to start World War three because these people have nukes we've got that
[29:25.740 --> 29:29.680]  report a bunch of political news the Newt Gendritch controversy it's not a
[29:29.680 --> 29:37.680]  controversy Newt Gendritch is as conservative as I don't know think of
[29:37.680 --> 29:42.680]  the most Al Gore I mean he basically is Al Gore he actually supports almost every
[29:42.680 --> 29:48.040]  policy Al Gore does Willie Nelson endorses Johnson we'll be right back I
[29:48.040 --> 29:55.400]  got a lot of other news we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.400 --> 30:02.760]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[30:02.760 --> 30:07.200]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[30:07.200 --> 30:11.200]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:11.200 --> 30:15.120]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[30:15.120 --> 30:19.120]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.120 --> 30:23.560]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[30:23.560 --> 30:28.320]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.080]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[30:32.080 --> 30:35.560]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[30:35.560 --> 30:39.480]  challenges number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[30:39.480 --> 30:42.640]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[32:05.360 --> 32:10.880]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[32:10.880 --> 32:13.560]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[32:13.560 --> 32:18.560]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[32:18.560 --> 32:23.160]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[32:23.160 --> 32:27.560]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[32:27.560 --> 32:32.800]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[32:32.800 --> 32:37.040]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[32:37.040 --> 32:40.600]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[32:40.600 --> 32:45.840]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[32:45.840 --> 32:51.880]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at

[33:46.760 --> 33:52.240]  getting Dr. Steve Pacinic back on in the next few days he called me a few days
[33:52.240 --> 33:55.440]  ago left a message talking about a Wall Street Journal article where they
[33:55.440 --> 34:04.440]  admit that the Al Qaeda operatives are being basically put into place in Libya
[34:04.440 --> 34:09.400]  and are being protected and taken off the terrorist list so that's some of the
[34:09.400 --> 34:13.200]  issues he wants to talk about and when we get him on we'll also put to him some
[34:13.200 --> 34:17.160]  of the questions that Joel Scousen brought up I also want to get Dr. Paul
[34:17.160 --> 34:20.320]  Craig Roberts on a little bit later in the week because he's got articles up at
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.120]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com the Strauss con frame up and the
[34:25.120 --> 34:30.120]  American police state strides forward and he makes some interesting points
[34:30.120 --> 34:35.880]  about the fact that normally globalist Bill Clinton and others are allowed to
[34:35.880 --> 34:41.120]  get away with whatever they want Al Gore why is this happening now is this an
[34:41.120 --> 34:45.200]  orchestrated event kind of like what we saw with WikiLeaks again I'm no fan of
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.640]  Dominic Strauss con but 60% of the French international poll think it's a
[34:49.640 --> 34:57.440]  setup and people that know him say that he'll hit on women prominent members of
[34:57.440 --> 35:01.880]  the government and in private circles say that con will hit on women but that
[35:01.880 --> 35:07.840]  he doesn't try to rape them and it's it's it's very interesting that he was
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.440]  about 10 points ahead of Nicolas Sarkozy who's not even French by the way
[35:12.440 --> 35:17.360]  Sarkozy he's not even born in France he got to love it I mean what is it with
[35:17.360 --> 35:20.560]  foreigners ruling on people's countries I don't go to France and try to run
[35:20.560 --> 35:23.920]  things why do I have Schwarzenegger over here running around as the governor
[35:23.920 --> 35:29.920]  formally and now wanting to be president I mean look I'm sorry I'm I'm now
[35:29.920 --> 35:34.080]  digressing but we're gonna work on that and we do have a red Beckman coming up
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.080]  here in about 26 minutes from now and dr. Christopher Busby in the last 30
[35:38.080 --> 35:42.520]  minutes of the third hour to go over the incredible information coming out at
[35:42.520 --> 35:48.000]  Fukushima this thing is now no doubt many times worse than Chernobyl and
[35:48.000 --> 35:57.880]  there's no mitigation even being tried to keep people away from fish milk and
[35:57.880 --> 36:02.600]  things like spinach and lettuce that really build up these radioactive
[36:02.600 --> 36:06.280]  isotopes there's not even testing being done at the federal level that's their
[36:06.280 --> 36:10.480]  job well it's the job they've usurped really is the state's jobs and they are
[36:10.480 --> 36:15.640]  trying to do their jobs but the feds control the purse strings and I've been
[36:15.640 --> 36:18.240]  out there trying to suppress universities and others from releasing
[36:18.240 --> 36:26.000]  the data this is a huge cover-up that's going on and very very upsetting and it's
[36:26.000 --> 36:33.080]  the same with genetic engineering it's the same with frequency pollution the
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.920]  conscious decision has been made to basically trash the planet by the very
[36:37.920 --> 36:41.160]  people who are always telling us give up our rights and liberties and our private
[36:41.160 --> 36:49.680]  property and our labor and that every facet of industry light bulbs toilets
[36:49.680 --> 36:55.000]  homes cars has to be regulated by them and only their buddies can get the
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.280]  contracts that's what it's about it's about a planned economy where the
[36:59.280 --> 37:03.560]  insiders are the only ones that are allowed to operate and then they just
[37:03.560 --> 37:07.560]  try to make us feel guilty and beat us into submission with the common sense
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.680]  overall veneer that our environment's got some problems and we need to take
[37:12.680 --> 37:18.360]  care of it but then you've got all these top liberal environmentalists they're
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.200]  not even liberal call themselves liberal like Mambiat the big one-world
[37:23.200 --> 37:28.640]  government promoter over in England the big rockstar guy of the so-called left
[37:28.640 --> 37:33.800]  saying he now firmly believes in nuclear power and that Fukushima is great
[37:33.800 --> 37:39.040]  and as dr. Busby said has pointed out here on this show and he's he's in those
[37:39.040 --> 37:47.280]  top circles in Europe and knows Mambia he bottom line it's more and more and
[37:47.280 --> 37:52.040]  Busby has to say as he said here months ago this is about population reduction
[37:52.040 --> 37:59.160]  nothing fries fertility like radiation fluoride's a close second and you
[37:59.160 --> 38:03.080]  notice they'll spend millions of dollars in lobbying to even get a small town to
[38:03.080 --> 38:07.080]  put it in and then they write all these books about how they're doing it to us
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.760]  of the fluoride I mean I mean that's what's frustrating is we're not
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.840]  theorizing about most of these issues you know looking at what they're doing
[38:15.840 --> 38:21.360]  and then trying to understand why they're doing it we're looking at what
[38:21.360 --> 38:25.880]  they're doing and they tell us in white papers what they're doing and it's just
[38:25.880 --> 38:31.160]  out in the open I mean when I read the Patriot Act and wrote the analysis that
[38:31.160 --> 38:40.400]  won the project censored award in 2003 and they flew me out to California and
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.000]  I was you know at their big awards dinner it was on free speech television
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.760]  that was a big deal for us at the time because we probably only reached half
[38:47.760 --> 38:52.640]  million people a day you know they had a group of lawyers and others go over my
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.880]  analysis of it and and they said we can't believe you written analysis this
[38:55.880 --> 39:01.120]  good and then that became the template of a lot of constitutional law scholars
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.000]  and others to just look at the Patriot Act and and all I did was look at where
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  they would point out that well to find out what this means you've got to go to
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  the US code we're changing this word and adding that word and it said in plain
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.280]  English for any misdemeanor you can be locked up and the key thrown away and
[39:21.280 --> 39:28.360]  no lawyer and we can break in your house and we can do whatever we want and it
[39:28.360 --> 39:34.240]  was all there in the act and and and the point is all these law scholars and
[39:34.240 --> 39:39.120]  people didn't go read the bill it was only 200 and something pages I did I
[39:39.120 --> 39:43.780]  went and read the bill I spent three days writing the analysis of the Patriot
[39:43.780 --> 39:50.840]  Act and the point is it's I can't do all of this and and then newspapers wrote
[39:50.840 --> 39:56.000]  articles saying Alex Jones conspiracy theorist claims that the Patriot Act is
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.600]  for the American people and not terrorist and here it is today out of KOAT
[40:03.600 --> 40:10.280]  television news 7 in Albuquerque delayed notice search warrants increasing
[40:10.280 --> 40:15.200]  warrants led agents in her homes without owner knowing a special type of
[40:15.200 --> 40:18.920]  government search warrant that allows authorities not servants authorities see
[40:18.920 --> 40:24.280]  how they to search homes without informing the owner for months well yeah
[40:24.280 --> 40:28.360]  and then there's another section saying you then can't tell anyone they broke in
[40:28.360 --> 40:31.480]  your home kind of like when they went to Border's books and wanted all their
[40:31.480 --> 40:37.200]  list of what folks were reading and then they told Border's books you will not
[40:37.200 --> 40:41.560]  tell anyone or will charge you with terrorism that's a subsection you can
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.120]  go read it and then Alex Jones analysis of Patriot Act one there's my analysis
[40:46.120 --> 40:52.640]  of Patriot Act two but continuing here I imagined someone walking through your
[40:52.640 --> 40:55.400]  neighborhood coming into your home and rifling through your intimate
[40:55.400 --> 40:58.880]  belongings they searched through your home your dresser drawers your computer
[40:58.880 --> 41:04.280]  files Peter Simpson or Simonson with ACLU New Mexico said these search
[41:04.280 --> 41:08.400]  warrants don't involve knocking on doors or any type of warning at all delayed
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.160]  notice search warrants are sneaking peak warrants allow federal agents to enter
[41:12.160 --> 41:17.560]  your home without telling you they've been there until months later and this
[41:17.560 --> 41:20.520]  article doesn't add then that they tell you under federal law you can't tell
[41:20.520 --> 41:25.440]  folks they were there the warrants have always been around but their use has
[41:25.440 --> 41:31.560]  spiked since the revamped Patriot Act in 2005 that's not even right they've not
[41:31.560 --> 41:39.040]  always been around they're around since the October passage of the Patriot Act
[41:39.040 --> 41:45.520]  in 2001 and yes they had Patriot Act to expanded it I mean these people can't
[41:45.520 --> 41:49.560]  even get this stuff right the number of delayed notice search warrants spiked
[41:49.560 --> 41:56.120]  nationally from around 700 in fiscal year 2007 to close to 2000 and 2009
[41:56.120 --> 42:00.240]  upwards of 200 approved during the same three-year stretch came out of the
[42:00.240 --> 42:04.560]  10th Circuit Court which covers a handful of states including New Mexico the
[42:04.560 --> 42:07.720]  majority of those delayed search warrants weren't even for terrorism related
[42:07.720 --> 42:12.160]  cases they got that right according to US Department of Justice figures the
[42:12.160 --> 42:18.360]  majority of warrants are for drug cases but see now through policy they're
[42:18.360 --> 42:24.720]  listing family violence marijuana as terror so even a lot of the things they
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.400]  list as terror aren't terror continues the warrants are so secret the New
[42:29.400 --> 42:33.120]  Mexico US Attorney General's office wouldn't go on record with Target 7
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.160]  about them the ACLU said it expects delayed notice warrants numbers to keep
[42:38.160 --> 42:41.880]  growing each year as long as certain parts of the Patriot Act remain on the
[42:41.880 --> 42:47.080]  books yeah yeah and in this itself is a whitewash but I'm I'm glad it's in the
[42:47.080 --> 42:57.080]  news if you simply type in state uses Patriot Act in non-terror related cases
[42:57.080 --> 43:00.520]  and then put the name of your state in it's usually the same boilerplate
[43:00.520 --> 43:06.160]  article you'll see yeah we used it 10,000 times in Alabama you know whatever
[43:06.160 --> 43:10.960]  thousand times in Tennessee how many times in New York marijuana or type in
[43:10.960 --> 43:14.840]  Patriot Act used in marijuana growing case and you'll you'll see this where
[43:14.840 --> 43:21.800]  they just don't even follow the Bill of Rights in Constitution and the first
[43:21.800 --> 43:27.760]  Patriot Act totally gutted six of the first ten amendments and I go from memory
[43:27.760 --> 43:31.640]  for my second analysis that's been seconded by a lot of other major
[43:31.640 --> 43:37.680]  constitutional law scholars all ten of them just completely gone you could say
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.600]  that the tent is an applicable because it deals with states but what do you
[43:42.600 --> 43:49.320]  think the threat fusion centers are and the quiet federalization of police see
[43:49.320 --> 43:54.720]  everything is about labeling and and and scripting and I'm not going to read part
[43:54.720 --> 43:57.120]  of this article just because it deals with the milk we've already covered that
[43:57.120 --> 44:06.920]  I want to read part of this because because it deals with how the feds
[44:06.920 --> 44:10.840]  operate the more I study them and then once you realize this you're like wow
[44:10.840 --> 44:17.320]  that was always pretty obvious well most great truths are as plain as the nose
[44:17.320 --> 44:29.080]  on your face or my face but when we come face-to-face pun intended with this
[44:29.080 --> 44:35.520]  naked of corruption this nakedness of abuse this this this this conscious
[44:35.520 --> 44:43.320]  systematic endemic system-wide prerequisite of corruption corruption
[44:43.320 --> 44:49.320]  isn't something they tolerate and it's growing it is the standard of the system
[44:49.320 --> 44:56.360]  it is the over-driving goal is to institutionalize torture and secret
[44:56.360 --> 45:01.320]  arrest and hands-down pants and trampling but in the case of the Amish and
[45:01.320 --> 45:08.840]  food co-ops and little farmers markets selling food grown locally why do they
[45:08.840 --> 45:12.440]  come in with guns drawn and slam people on the ground for no reason you've seen
[45:12.440 --> 45:17.360]  the surveillance tapes on the news why do they have a year-long half million
[45:17.360 --> 45:24.160]  dollar investigation of an Amish guy publicly selling legal milk why do they
[45:24.160 --> 45:28.120]  do all this they do it as part of theater that's how they fool these
[45:28.120 --> 45:33.160]  juries well the federal juries are kept criminals on average who just stay on
[45:33.160 --> 45:36.680]  the jury and would do whatever they're told that's why they have 98% of
[45:36.680 --> 45:40.240]  conviction rates I mean again 98% of folks aren't aren't guilty ladies and
[45:40.240 --> 45:48.040]  gentlemen the old saying better than 10 guilty men go free than one innocent
[45:48.040 --> 45:52.120]  man you know go to prison and now DNA showing one around a third of people on
[45:52.120 --> 45:56.120]  death rows turns out are completely innocent and witnesses later come out or
[45:56.120 --> 45:59.560]  they catch somebody with the body buried in their basement a decade later and
[45:59.560 --> 46:04.080]  it's a hundred percent and still the states will fight to keep them in jail
[46:04.080 --> 46:07.280]  I've seen that in Texas yeah you're a hundred percent innocent we're gonna try
[46:07.280 --> 46:14.280]  to keep you on death row I mean these are because they can't ever let you get
[46:14.280 --> 46:17.720]  an inch on them they've got to keep pushing and bending and twisting
[46:17.720 --> 46:24.280]  everything and and normalizing it but but imagine all the crime going on 11
[46:24.280 --> 46:28.560]  years full dossiers from inside made-offs organization people that had
[46:28.560 --> 46:32.000]  worked with him of how the fraud was working hundred plus billion in fraud
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.880]  and the FCC would do nothing in fact there's evidence that they were warning
[46:36.880 --> 46:40.200]  people on the inside and then then folks that were blown the whistle were
[46:40.200 --> 46:44.320]  getting persecuted it was multiple high-powered folks that blew the whistle
[46:44.320 --> 46:50.560]  11 years of course the system is there to guard the high-level criminals but
[46:50.560 --> 46:57.160]  look at this article on Ron Paul that Ron Paul wrote it's up on info wars.com
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.680]  Ron Paul the milk police and I won't read the whole thing but on April 20th
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.000]  after a year-long undercover sting operation again he publicly was selling
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.320]  it for years publicly selling it to private customers totally legal people
[47:10.320 --> 47:18.480]  go driving for miles around to get it and they had a sting and they do the
[47:18.480 --> 47:22.880]  sting so they can go to the jury and talk about a sting and a SWAT team raid
[47:22.880 --> 47:29.080]  and and and and phrase it so the dumb domesticated jury but this is a federal
[47:29.080 --> 47:34.600]  jury so they won't need that well we'll think it's illegal and then they'll
[47:34.600 --> 47:40.280]  narrowly interpret some interstate commerce clause to fool the jury just
[47:40.280 --> 47:43.960]  like they used counterfeiting clause to convict Von Nutthaus,
[47:43.960 --> 47:53.560]  Nutthaus they just went in and said you know issuing a script that is in the
[47:53.560 --> 47:57.760]  likeness and meant to deceive and and then clearly that's not what it was but
[47:57.760 --> 48:01.840]  but see they don't care on April 20th after a year-long undercover sting
[48:01.840 --> 48:05.240]  operation armed federal agents acting on behalf of the Food and Drug
[48:05.240 --> 48:10.960]  Administration raid the business of Pennsylvania Amish farmer David or Dan
[48:10.960 --> 48:15.640]  say I try to hurry and then I start babbling I need to take my time on
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.680]  April 20th after a year-long undercover sting operation armed federal agents
[48:19.680 --> 48:23.520]  acting on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration raided the business of
[48:23.520 --> 48:34.720]  Pennsylvania Amish farmer Dan A-L-L-G-Y-E-R Alger to prevent him from
[48:34.720 --> 48:40.400]  selling his unpasteurized milk to willing fully informed customers in
[48:40.400 --> 48:45.520]  Maryland federal agents wasted a whole year and who knows how many of our tax
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.320]  dollars posing as customers in order to catch the Amish farmer committing the
[48:50.320 --> 48:57.280]  quote crime that's in quotes of selling his milk he was not tricking people into
[48:57.280 --> 49:00.480]  buying and he was not forcing people to purchase it and there had been no
[49:00.480 --> 49:06.960]  complaints about his products see no problems no no no victim these were
[49:06.960 --> 49:11.560]  completely voluntary transactions but one that our nanny state federal
[49:11.560 --> 49:15.160]  government did not approve of and so they shut down his business the arrogance
[49:15.160 --> 49:19.760]  of the FDA and so many other federal agencies is simply appalling these
[49:19.760 --> 49:23.760]  types of police-state raids on peaceful businessmen so reminiscent of our
[49:23.760 --> 49:29.760]  tyrannical federal drug war have no place in free society and he goes on but
[49:29.760 --> 49:33.240]  see Ron Paul is going from the position of this was wasteful and stupid it's
[49:33.240 --> 49:38.920]  not stupid at all this makes complete sense if you go back into the 50s big
[49:38.920 --> 49:43.280]  Agra went in on record and I've had historical Gaston have written books on
[49:43.280 --> 49:49.120]  the subject and I've talked to old dairy farmers who were who witnessed it big
[49:49.120 --> 49:56.760]  Agra business wanted to be able to sell tainted milk because before if you
[49:56.760 --> 50:01.520]  gave a cow too much growth hormone or worked on it too much or gave it other
[50:01.520 --> 50:06.800]  drugs it's others would swell up it would produce twice as much milk but it
[50:06.800 --> 50:13.320]  would have blood in it pus in it a lot the cows kick a lot of manure into it
[50:13.320 --> 50:19.040]  and in a real dairy farm if that happened you just had to dump out the
[50:19.040 --> 50:25.760]  entire milk and and start over well big Agra business didn't want to do that and
[50:25.760 --> 50:29.160]  they also wanted to be able to bring in new regulations that would shut down the
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.840]  smaller dairies and of course the old milk wasn't pasteurized and was
[50:32.840 --> 50:37.480]  delivered fresh to your door and the big grocery stores and others they didn't
[50:37.480 --> 50:41.720]  want that they wanted to industrialize it so they could feed you crud it's the
[50:41.720 --> 50:45.440]  same thing with the radiating the meat now and the spraying the viruses on it
[50:45.440 --> 50:49.080]  to kill the bacteria so they could feed you rotten meat and get away with it I
[50:49.080 --> 50:53.400]  want to finish up with this when we get back because it shows the
[50:53.400 --> 50:58.200]  industrialization of food production but also how they put on these events to
[50:58.200 --> 51:01.520]  act like you're doing something criminal when you're not we all know that

[52:02.360 --> 52:07.600]  Alex Jones here with key information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that
[52:07.600 --> 52:10.920]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[52:10.920 --> 52:15.920]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US
[52:15.920 --> 52:20.880]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by

[54:12.640 --> 54:18.200]  so I hurt myself there's a lot of things going on here and you know Ron Paul
[54:18.200 --> 54:21.520]  goes with the angle that it's wasteful it's stupid to spend a year do all this
[54:21.520 --> 54:27.120]  undercover stuff for an Amish guys dairy people pulled right up to and privately
[54:27.120 --> 54:31.600]  bought milk from him here in Austin there are a whole bunch of little private
[54:31.600 --> 54:37.400]  dairies where you pull right up and buy it privately it's a private sale and to
[54:37.400 --> 54:40.360]  not have the regulators harass them there's no law but to not have the
[54:40.360 --> 54:45.120]  regulators harass them you sign up to be part of the private club just like you
[54:45.120 --> 54:49.800]  can in towns that are dry I remember growing up in Rockwall Texas when it
[54:49.800 --> 54:55.280]  was still dry we go to the Mexican food restaurant El Chico on Sundays sometimes
[54:55.280 --> 55:02.120]  after church and rarely did my dad want a beer not a big drinker but sometimes he
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.520]  would want a beer and they would say may we see your card and he'd pull out his
[55:05.520 --> 55:11.680]  little club card to be able to get a beer and so that's an example of the club
[55:11.680 --> 55:17.400]  card you you have a club card you know to be engaged in private commerce with
[55:17.400 --> 55:21.600]  someone that way you're not a commercial outfit and what they did in the 50s and
[55:21.600 --> 55:25.800]  then in the 60s is they they got regulations in place that for general
[55:25.800 --> 55:30.400]  distribution and sale and transported across state lines you've got to have
[55:30.400 --> 55:34.880]  the milk homogenized and they take it and they boil it and they heat it up and
[55:34.880 --> 55:44.800]  it kills all of the live vaccines the colostrum that's in it and it totally
[55:44.800 --> 55:48.920]  changes I mean that was the old thing when a kid was sick 100 years ago they
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.480]  said give him fresh milk fresh milk that comes out of the cow still warm give it
[55:53.480 --> 55:56.560]  to your baby you know when they're sick give it to your child because it's full
[55:56.560 --> 56:00.560]  of antibodies and everything else well they just boil it and cook it but that's
[56:00.560 --> 56:06.680]  not why big agribusiness you did it you know so you wouldn't get those healthy
[56:06.680 --> 56:12.280]  things that's the byproduct on the surface it's that they cook they big
[56:12.280 --> 56:15.640]  agribusiness wanted to be able to ship milk a thousand miles they wanted the
[56:15.640 --> 56:20.800]  stuff to last for two weeks on the shelf before people knew dairies that had the
[56:20.800 --> 56:25.160]  freshest milk it was extremely rare I've seen the statistics for any type of
[56:25.160 --> 56:28.080]  problems from milk if it did have a problem it wouldn't smell right or
[56:28.080 --> 56:32.360]  taste right it was delivered fresh from the dairy in a matter of hours that's
[56:32.360 --> 56:36.120]  why you had milk men at first with horses and carriages and then with little
[56:36.120 --> 56:40.840]  trucks because it was fresh milk and big agra said well we're being killed by all
[56:40.840 --> 56:46.280]  the local dairies they've got dairies in every town it's a big business how do we
[56:46.280 --> 56:49.600]  come in and knock out all these local dairies well we get lost past where they
[56:49.600 --> 56:56.240]  can't have fresh milk it's got to be boiled heated up and that way we could
[56:56.240 --> 56:59.760]  knock them out and it's the same thing now six years ago they passed a federal
[56:59.760 --> 57:04.840]  regulation along in the spray you just type in the search engine bacteria eating
[57:04.840 --> 57:10.000]  viruses sprayed on meat and when it's covered in feces and blood and rotten
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.320]  horrible conditions most of the meat you eat they just spray it with viruses
[57:14.320 --> 57:19.400]  that are a vaccine a live vaccine stewed up in big tanks to kill it to eat the
[57:19.400 --> 57:23.920]  bacteria but you still have the toxins from the bacteria so it causes brain
[57:23.920 --> 57:30.600]  damage and a lot of other things they then do other things like of course
[57:30.600 --> 57:34.600]  radiating and most the lunch meats and things you get now and they don't even
[57:34.600 --> 57:39.800]  tell you are radiated and it destroys most of the food value but the main
[57:39.800 --> 57:46.200]  reason is it allows them to sell stuff that is rotten it kills the bacteria
[57:46.200 --> 57:51.840]  see before they had to throw that stuff out or put it in dog food and then of
[57:51.840 --> 57:56.400]  course that causes all the problems in pets so it's a way for big agribusiness
[57:56.400 --> 58:00.640]  to get away with murder it's a way for them to shut down their competition and
[58:00.640 --> 58:03.960]  that's why they spent tens of millions of dollars and one week alone last year
[58:03.960 --> 58:09.000]  trying to lobby was it 17 million or 14 million I forget now to get the food
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.760]  safety bill passed big agra has food safety disasters and then they trend
[58:14.760 --> 58:18.200]  around and say we'll pass the food safety bill written by them to shut down
[58:18.200 --> 58:22.200]  farms and ranches small ones that on that if you look at the numbers have to
[58:22.200 --> 58:27.400]  save us and clean his food meanwhile the big industrial capacity outfits they
[58:27.400 --> 58:32.560]  are exempt from the new food safety act that they lobby to get put in just like
[58:32.560 --> 58:35.200]  Obama's friends are exempt from having to get health care for their employees
[58:35.200 --> 58:40.480]  but everybody else is so that's what they're doing here

[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:32.440]  founder of the fully informed jury movement and one of the men who traveled
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.800]  the country proving that the amendment to give us the income tax was never
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.120]  ratified red Beckman the author of the law that never was is going to be joining
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.240]  us coming out in the next segment in light of the big push by the corporate
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.320]  globalist disinformation outfits the brainwashing command centers known as
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.920]  mainstream media in light of all their demonization of the sovereign citizen
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.440]  movement and that's basically anybody with an American flag hanging on their
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:04.320]  car gets lumped in with a Ku Klux Klan we've got him coming on with us in the
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.840]  last 30 minutes of the next hour we've got Dr. Chris Busby coming on about the
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:18.320]  incredible developments going on at Fukushima I was getting into this whole
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.080]  raw milk situation how they do these big year-long investigations and they've
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.720]  got to do that to act like the Amish man legally and lawfully selling milk has
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.600]  done something bad so that the jury sees the year investigation and so they can
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.040]  put on this whole theatrical event like it's illegal then they can misconstru
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.120]  some federal regulation and thrown behind bars to shut down competition to
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.840]  Big Agra that lobbies hundreds of millions of dollars a year total into the
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:53.000]  coffers of the politicians and so that's why all over the country I know up
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.520]  until about a year ago you go to the farmers market in Austin and go right
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:05.240]  over and buy milk that was you know milked out of a cow at 4 a.m. and then at
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.840]  10 a.m. was delivered to the farmers market best stuff you ever tasted it's
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:16.000]  real milk but then they had undercovers buying it and acting creepy and threats
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.360]  were being made so then you couldn't get it anymore and they just take normal
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.800]  behavior just like all over the country if you try to protest peacefully they'll
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.120]  try to come over and tell you they're gonna arrest you if you don't leave you
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.040]  got to have a permit yeah and you'll be in a town like Austin where the city's
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.880]  lost lawsuits the state police have lost lawsuits in Austin for arresting
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.880]  people saying they got to have a permit to protest and you got to go you know
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.480]  officer you guys lost a bunch of suits I'm informed and then they'll look at you
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.720]  and just go okay and then they'll mass riot trips across the street and say
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.600]  we're gonna arrest you now and I go fine I'm gonna sue you personally please
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:01.680]  don't violate the Bellarites please have some common decency and the cops will
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.840]  just I mean I've got it on video one-time protest in Perry outside a hotel the
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:14.280]  cops goes fine and stomps off pure color of law totally illegal a tyrant
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:19.760]  they're trying to twist and then all these TV shows where the cops are
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.640]  always heroes and good guys and everything I'm supposed to like not sit
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:32.240]  here and criticize the cop for doing that there's no greater danger than
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:38.080]  uniformed agents of the state calling themselves authorities and officials
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.960]  openly trying to intimidate people off the street corner I mean that's the
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.600]  essence of the KGB the essence of Nazi Germany the essence of what the red
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:54.200]  coats were doing pre-1776 I mean this is armed thugs with a 10 badge coming
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.040]  over and saying you as an American can't stand on the street corner and do what
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:05.480]  you're doing and I mean I feel sorry for those New York cops that arrested me
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:10.280]  for protesting her all over vera and then charging me with something that
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.720]  wasn't an arrestable offense that they crammed the cuffs on it didn't resist
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.840]  in any way I was polite they should turn around and they just rich them on as
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:30.000]  hard as they could we're laughing about it it's just amazing I mean what type of
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.360]  person would in what would would see an American protesting outside Fox Studios
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:42.680]  as somebody who needed to be taught I mean they should be proud of me they
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.920]  should be proud of the first they should be proud of living in America but
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.920]  instead I need to be taught what cell we put him in put him in the dirty cell
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.000]  shove me in there with crap all over the floor everything else and laugh about
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.400]  it I mean what does that say about their souls a very wealthy US citizen is

[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:36.000]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well for the next 15 three
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.520]  minutes or so we are joined by a true patriot icon red Beckman influential
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.000]  figure really in the founding of the modern reassertions of the militia
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  movement anti-private Federal Reserve activist the founder of the fully
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.120]  informed jury association movement the co-author of the law that never was the
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.640]  fraud of the 16th Amendment and personal income tax by Bill Benson and MJ Red
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.640]  Beckman just an amazing individual author of so many other books born again
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:16.560]  republic walls in our minds IRS and the black-robed cover-up I mean he is the
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:24.720]  proto tea party he is the proto Ron Paul he is the there's very few people what
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:34.600]  a Bob Chapman a oh there's people like I mean I mean there's not many others out
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.280]  there G Edward Griffin but red Beckman has seen this from the very beginning
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.800]  when he got out of the Air Force in the 1950s and witnessed how America was
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.840]  changing and I wanted to get him on to pick his brain about the way America's
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:56.400]  changed what concerns him most what he thinks is most positive and most
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:01.640]  negative and we're seeing a real heat up going on right now a full rollout on
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:08.880]  MSNBC CNN 60-minute CBS newspaper articles saying if you want to abolish
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.800]  the Federal Reserve you're American Al Qaeda if you got a Ron Paul sticker
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.600]  you're American Al Qaeda if you don't want to turn your guns in you're American
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.440]  Al Qaeda if you don't like government-run health care you're a white
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.320]  supremacist American Al Qaeda and and I see a real preparatory phase where
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.160]  they're saying these groups are going to stage in Oklahoma City and White House
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.160]  advisors several of them even Glenn Beck covered this three months ago I've
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.720]  come out and said listening myself and Glenn Beck of all people that we're
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.040]  going to cause a new Oklahoma City and then they go on in the internal letters
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.320]  that have been public saying how great one would be and how it would help their
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.960]  agenda so the real restoration movement against the globalist revolution it to
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:56.040]  destroy our Republic and make us deader slaves is in high gear and the
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.600]  revolutionaries the cannon fodder communists and their elk the collectivist
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.560]  they're being told that their gravy train is going to continue their welfare
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.640]  train if they can destroy the middle class and of course they'll never even
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.720]  get any of the chicken feed that will continue to go offshore now George
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:17.920]  Soros according to even the Associated Press Fox News and other breakdowns has
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.960]  spent 46 million so far this year he's gone into high gear with color
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.560]  revolution leftist groups because they know the revolution's coming with the
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.640]  collapse of society and I asked red Beckman in the last break I said what is
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.520]  most important we were getting ready to come on what he would talk about first
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.800]  and he basically said what I just said from a historical perspective he called
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.680]  it stealing the revolution or stealing the restoration is what I would dub it
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.400]  these are the most dangerous times have ever been in the same group of
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.680]  international banks that are based in Europe where the bailout money went
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:56.400]  financed the Russian takeover on record they financed Hitler as a wind-up toy
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.360]  that's on record so they can then counter him they do plan a hot revolution
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:09.280]  and the Marxist-Leninist leadership does say blood is the answer I sat across
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.080]  the table a few weeks ago from a well-known leftist who confided they
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.480]  were really a Marxist and blood was the answer after they had a few drinks in
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:26.640]  them and said it very proudly but it's gonna be blood of somebody that owns a
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.320]  car dealership not of the globalist sitting offshore it's gonna be the blood
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.480]  of anybody that's got one more dollar than them and this whole thing's been
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.320]  financed by the Ford Foundation and others on record the illegal alien
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.720]  brigades all of it but the globalist are in trouble the awakening was stronger
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.760]  than they predicted it would be they knew moving the system in there would be
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:53.280]  a counter to it and a red beckman joins us red break down your concern and the
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:59.000]  message we've got to get out to the tea party dealing with the stealing of the
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:07.440]  revolution by the way it's real good to be back on your show
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:20.200]  been a while since I've been on anyway I I think that the tea party thing you
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:27.000]  know I was afraid they might kind of fade out and and kind of disappear after
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:33.480]  the election but that's not the case they are continuing to learn and and
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:39.600]  grow and and this is one of the best things that we've ever had happen in
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:46.960]  the country because they are continuing and there's no way with the the the
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:53.000]  radio talk shows and the internet and everything they they are learning they're
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.200]  getting you know an education on on how this thing has deteriorated and who's
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:10.440]  behind it and it's been a real gratifying thing for me because way back
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:16.680]  there 25 years or so ago people would ask me they'd say well when is this all
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:21.160]  going to happen when are we going to get this turn around and I would tell
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:26.640]  them I say it's not going to happen until we have an economic meltdown and
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:32.280]  then we'll have the people's attention and that's exactly what has happened and
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:40.120]  and so what we need to get across to the tea party people is that it's actually
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:48.480]  a very small minority the international bankers and the George sources and and
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:55.760]  the schemers that they're a very small minority the tea party people are the
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:05.200]  majority and when I say tea party I'm thinking of not just you know the
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:11.560]  people that call them tea party people but I'm just guessing that there's
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:17.960]  probably ten times as many people out there that think like the tea party
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:24.480]  people that are just laying alone and just trying to learn and and play
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:31.600]  catch-up on what has happened to our country and so the majority in this
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:41.040]  country right now are swaying over to our way of thinking we want to be free
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:47.520]  we don't want to be governed and we don't want to be plundered by that
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:56.560]  elite group of bankers and international scoundrels and I'll tell you the one
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:03.200]  thing that the scoundrels the Bolsheviks I'm going to call them the
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:12.720]  Bolsheviks just like in 1917 they they can only operate if the people are
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:20.360]  ignorant and don't know about their schemes and so it's the utmost importance
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.960]  that we get across to the people the tea party people the majority in this
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:31.800]  nation the story of these scoundrels and who they are and when that happens
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:38.440]  they're exposed and never forget we still have our guns in this country
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.400]  now this isn't Russia where you had a bunch of good Christian hard-working but
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.280]  disarmed peasants who'd already been under tyranny of the czar and just
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:54.400]  traded it out for something far worse red I want to bring this up right now we
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.400]  have Newt Genrich who I hear mainline talk radio hailing is this great
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:05.720]  conservative Newt Genrich is an anti-gun pro socialist health care pro carbon
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.120]  tax pusher and I tell Republicans this face-to-face and they laugh at me and
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:14.600]  then on my iPhone at restaurants and on the street or with neighbors I can pull
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:18.920]  it up and show him on TV ads for carbon taxes I can show him for a socialist
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.480]  health care Mitt Romney raised 10 million in a few hours from corporate
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:29.560]  donors Mitt Romney helped write the bill in Massachusetts for socialist health
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:35.880]  care that is the model of Obamacare and you tell you tell some of these tea
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:39.960]  party people this and they laugh at you kind of like I was in McBride's gun
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:44.760]  shop a few years ago and Bush was still in office and a guy came over it's a big
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:48.560]  gun shop and said Alex I don't appreciate you lying about President Bush and
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.720]  saying he supported the assault weapons ban I didn't get mad I said well I said
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.800]  it's a fact and then the owner comes over or one of the managers believe it was
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.720]  the honor and says no mr. Jones is right he did and the guy went oh so you know
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:07.360]  these people have almost invincible ignorance and and and I remember two
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.280]  and a half three years ago right when Obama first got in Rick Perry was being
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.400]  booed by the quote tea party senator Cornyn right here in Texas and the and
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.400]  the left and right establishment got desperate and they rushed in they rushed
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.720]  in and they tried to make it a partisan issue and they said it's only
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:29.600]  Republicans they're being bused in they're being paid for by the Republican
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.960]  Party and then the rep so Democrats wouldn't feel like hey I'm against the
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.480]  big banks and bailouts it was more of a Ron Paul movement it was honest it was
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.240]  honest they were doing Republicans and Democrats that mean they they had it you
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:45.360]  know straight they were red beckman Alex Jones listeners and then the
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.800]  Republicans took to basically fulfill that false prophecy ran in with buses
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:55.960]  and TV ads and Fox pushing it with their own tea parties run by Dick army to try
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:02.640]  to co-opt it but it hasn't been totally successful and that's why whenever this
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.360]  this creature of his globalist who openly calls for world government Newt
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.080]  Enrich comes out and says we need to not be hardcore Republicans we need to not
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.680]  cut government that's why they've now rebuked him and he was one of the front
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.600]  runners he's now dead meat because the tea party has gotten in his face and said
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.880]  you're a you're a shameful creature and so what you're saying is there's a
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:32.680]  battle over the soul of the tea party absolutely and I you know there's
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:40.560]  something else that is feeding into this but this whole picture I stay there
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:43.800]  tell us about the something else on the other side then we'll look at all the
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.560]  movements you've founded and then not because we're tooting reds horn it's an

[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:33.880]  red Beckman is our guest red you were getting to a point as we went to break
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:41.640]  yes and of course you brought up you know different organizations that I've
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:52.920]  been a part of and such and you had mentioned Aladaskin and the 60 minutes
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:25:01.960]  segment that they had on Sunday night that were they were really down on
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:10.400]  anybody that has anything bad to say about our government I didn't see the
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:16.160]  program but I know Aladas quite well he's a very sharp sharp American and a
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:24.680]  very patriotic American and they were ridiculing the idea of this sovereignty
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:33.600]  and I couldn't help but chuckle when I heard about it because all you have to do
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:42.920]  is ask an attorney about one person on a jury having the authority and the power
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:51.760]  to hang a jury one person can hang a 12-person jury and there is no conviction
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:58.680]  when that happens and of course this is where I started more when I started
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:04.800]  teaching about the jury and jury nullification I got a handle on that
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:14.160]  very early date of how that we the people have sovereignty and it is proven
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:24.480]  when we get into a court and one person hanging a jury in a tax case or any other
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:31.560]  case where the government is harassing the individual one person has more power
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:39.440]  than the president of the United States even if it's Obama one person has more
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:46.000]  power than the Congress the House and the Senate combined one person on that
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.600]  jury has more power than the whole nine nine justices of the Supreme Court
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:57.000]  that are nothing more than government agents because they're all government
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:05.440]  employees and so one person has that power that tells us that the people are
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:12.960]  the sovereigns not the government and there's many other ways that we can you
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:20.600]  know identify the sovereignty of the people but it would be a really great
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:28.600]  if the tea parties would pick up on this sovereignty thing and and recognize the
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:35.880]  power of a jury and of course I was the inspiration behind the formation of the
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:41.800]  full-informed jury association I did it's help
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:51.040]  Dom Doig and Larry Dodge to start that organization but in I started the ball
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:28:02.160]  rolling in December of 1979 I spoke at the libertarian state convention the
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.560]  first libertarian party the modern libertarian party there's first state
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:13.880]  convention in Montana Larry Dodge and Dom Doig were there it took ten years for
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:21.160]  them to really grasp we cross trails a number of times of course and and I kept
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:29.400]  telling them about you know the jury power and then in 1989 ten years later
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:38.800]  they had gotten enough of a you know a mental strength there that they had
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.880]  gathered together to where they recognized that I was correct in what I
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:51.400]  was saying and they they put that organization together and that organization
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:57.920]  is doing a great job right today and and that's caused the globalist real it
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:06.600]  really is a tremendous thrill for me when I see what they're doing and how
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:12.040]  they're growing and it's just everything is working for them and of course the
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:19.160]  tea party people need to pick up on this jury thing and how important it is we
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:23.920]  we've got a long segment coming up and we'll be able to continue to break this
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:30.040]  down I want to get into the Federal Reserve the income tax being a fraud the
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.320]  facts on that your ideas for restoring the Republic I also want to talk about
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:42.160]  the true role of the jury with you on the other side red Beckman is our guest
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:47.000]  and the fully informed jury associations on such a good job educating jurors that
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.480]  the globalist you're trying to move to get rid of juries all together we're on
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:30:00.960]  the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is

[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.280]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:29.840]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four

[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:50.160]  not ratified and then documented it went to all the state attorney generals also

[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:10.240]  box one nine five four nine Austin Texas seven eight seven six zero now going
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.160]  back to red Beckman read you specifically off-air made the point to
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.960]  yours truly that you don't see any way that the system is not going to collapse
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:23.600]  and that it's through that crises that the establishment is going to try to put
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:29.720]  forward its false solutions which are more of what brought us to this point
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:38.440]  yes that's why I stressed that the tea party people and the people that think
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:46.160]  like those tea party people really need to recognize the fact that they are the
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:54.920]  majority that they are armed and they are becoming informed about what's
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:00.400]  happening in our country because they need to have a lot of confidence they
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:08.040]  need to have the kind of confidence that will help them to you might say
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:13.440]  counter all the propaganda and such it's put are going to be put out by the
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:19.320]  major media because we have to recognize that the major media is not on the part
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:25.520]  of we the people they're not representing us at all and so we've
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:32.880]  got to hit it across to the tea party people that we are the majority and we
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:40.520]  are not going to tolerate you know a takeover of our political system like
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:47.040]  they did in Russia back in 1917 we're not gonna let that happen we have learned
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.560]  some lessons from what happened to those people back then we're not gonna let it
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:59.040]  happen and we don't have to let it happen and so I just I'm always the
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:04.880]  optimist and I think we've got a lot to be optimistic about at this point in
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:11.480]  time and of course you mentioned the Federal Reserve Bank believe you me
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:17.880]  before people had their houses foreclosed and all you can't explain
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:21.400]  anything to them about the Federal Reserve Bank they just didn't know they
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:27.120]  thought it was part of the federal government and all that when somebody
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.160]  gets in that kind of financial trouble where the where their house is being
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:38.120]  foreclosed you can educate those people you can tell those people about the
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:43.440]  Federal Reserve Bank and they can grasp what you're saying and so it isn't
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:48.200]  necessarily just the ones that have the houses foreclosed but your neighbors
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:52.360]  all around you well I'll tell you what they really grasp that it was secret
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.880]  where the tens of trillions went and we finally found out about where some of it
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.760]  went it was the foreign offshore banks who own the Federal Reserve it was to
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:07.400]  media thousands of newspapers MSNBC Rachel Maddow is paid by the Federal
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.160]  Reserve with our money to sit there and say people that don't like the Federal
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:19.280]  Reserve are terrorists I mean this is outrageous naked propaganda and as
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:25.080]  people learn more and more I mean take Iceland they said no had a game of
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:28.320]  breaksmanship with the IMF and World Bank the British government started
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.440]  suing their government the people rebelled for over a year until their
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:38.240]  government got in line and they discovered over 90% was like 91% of the
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.880]  debt was owed by the very banks saying that Iceland was in debt and the same
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:49.440]  thing just came out over 80% in in Ireland that they didn't owe this the
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.400]  banks too big to fail say we've got to raise your taxes we've got to do all
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:58.200]  this to you or the economy will implode you owe us this but only because they
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.800]  bought off the governments to have them to sign on to it and the big Federal
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.400]  Reserve lackeys the IMF World Bank lackeys have on record positioned the
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:11.560]  US and Europe for economic implosion as economic hitmen to go into
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.960]  receivership this is on record but they've they've they've miscalculated
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:21.880]  because now we go from Ron Paul having no co-sponsor 16 years ago for his bill
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.800]  to audit and basically in the Fed and now it passed the House was killed in the
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:30.560]  Senate the point is that's why Brazilian ski last year came out and said the
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.720]  elite are in deep trouble for the first time all of humanity is awake and
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.560]  staring at the elite we're not staring now at their puppet frontmen Republican
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.120]  Democrat that come and go people are really starting to learn about who
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.360]  really runs the show through fraud and how these big mega banks have record
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:53.640]  bonuses from our tax money and that even the austerity they're talking about is
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:58.240]  just a cut government so all the money can go to the bankers we're saying no
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.600]  get rid of the Federal Reserve right off the quadrillion and derivatives first
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.720]  then we'll talk about getting rid of all this welfare which is what they use to
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.400]  make people dependent so they can use the welfare hordes as an army against the
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:16.200]  middle class you know the elites cannon fodder so it's all coming to a head red
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:22.760]  let's talk about who the banksters are what the Federal Reserve Act is the
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.680]  law that never was investigation I mean because on the 60 minutes piece they're
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.680]  like what's gonna run the government if you don't pay income tax and I love our
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:35.240]  Ron Paul always points out on TV when they say that that the capital and the
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:40.680]  whole government was built without an income tax so so explain the reality of
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:50.960]  folks you see of the Constitution for the United States of America article 1
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:56.920]  section 8 of the Constitution says that the Congress shall have the power to lay
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:04.120]  and collect taxes excises impose some duties there's absolutely no
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:12.760]  constitutional basis for an income tax is totally forbidden the federal
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:21.240]  government was to get the financing to keep itself alive and going it was to
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:28.360]  collect tariffs and excises and such but article 1 section 9 clause 4 says
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:35.640]  there can be no direct tax and a direct tax of course is directly on the
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:43.160]  individual and so the Constitution the founders were wise man and they put it
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:50.160]  right there the Constitution that there can be no direct tax and the income tax
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:55.720]  is a direct tax so it's in direct violation of the Constitution for the
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:01.560]  United States of America you know I remember I've been around long enough I
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:08.640]  remember World War two when Vivian Callums the lady industrialist from
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:14.400]  East Coast she took on the Internal Revenue Service and the federal government
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:20.240]  when they passed this nonsense about the withholding tax and it was going to be
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:28.280]  just a wartime tax and it was supposed to be removed after the war was over and
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:35.840]  Vivian Callums had about 400 employees and she said I am not going to do all
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:42.680]  that additional book work to withhold taxes she said is the involuntary
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:48.280]  servitude and she ended up in court and it was a long battle but she finally
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:57.040]  won it but you see they told us so many lies and everything is a lie anymore you
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:01.440]  just don't get the truth they told us that the withholding tax would cease
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:07.360]  after the war and it's still with us today all these many many years later
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:16.880]  and of course back in Montana in 1980 we had some farmers ranchers small
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.280]  business people and such that got their heads together and said we're gonna find
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:30.120]  out if the 16th Amendment was properly ratified because the 16th Amendment was
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:38.360]  supposedly ratified so that the Congress could get around Article 1 Section 8 of
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:44.520]  the Constitution and Article 1 Section 9 the Direct Act and of course those
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:50.680]  people there in Montana they they did a lot of research they checked with all
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:59.360]  the state archives and all that type of thing and by 1983 January of 83 they had
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:06.120]  the documentations from each and every state having to do with how the state
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:12.040]  legislatures had operated and how they had voted for the 16th Amendment or voted
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:18.280]  against it or most of them did in fact if we want to be technical and of course
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:27.080]  the law is supposed to be technical and if we if we check the documentation real
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:33.880]  carefully not one single state properly ratified the 16th Amendment to the
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:41.240]  Constitution and that was 1913 when they declared that it was to be part of our
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:47.440]  Constitution that it had been ratified we the American people have been far too
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:56.120]  patient we've been far too easy to get along with but that is changing and
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:02.160]  people now are learning about the 16th Amendment and the fraud the but to be
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.680]  clear though because I've read the law that never was everything they can I
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:11.320]  read I just interrupt because I've I've read you you and Benson's book and I've
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:16.840]  gone and you know looked into it it is true that none of them properly did it
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:21.800]  but from your research because I've read the book in over a decade how many
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:26.480]  states just completely didn't even ratify it but were listed and how did the
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:30.240]  system get away with that why because the states were meeting every two years
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.080]  or so and there wasn't good coordination and so the feds just announced and the
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:39.680]  and at the same time they got rid of the states having us senators where the
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:45.160]  states legislatures would vote for the senator so they controlled them they
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:48.200]  got rid of that they gave us the income tax they gave us the fellow reserve I
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:53.560]  mean they did it all in one fell swoop how was that coup ram through and did
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:48:00.040]  any states complain about it there were some states that complained about it but
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:08.200]  not to the point where they were heard you have to recognize the fact that our
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:16.040]  media back then consisted of one one thing and that was newspapers and that
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:22.720]  was controlled basically by the William Randolph Hearst organization and and
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:32.560]  even at that stage of the game the media was already controlled and the media
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:41.280]  who was you know the media who was not for the people it was for the elite it
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:47.160]  was controlled by the elite William Randolph Hearst would have to be
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:54.200]  recognized as part of the elite and he was news organization his newspaper
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:49:00.640]  kingdom was the source for all information for all the newspapers in the
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:08.640]  country for the most part and so the people weren't told the truth and so
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:15.480]  they weren't and of course you've got to remember that they sold this idea to the
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:20.120]  American people they said we're gonna we're gonna soak the rich we're gonna
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:26.520]  soak the rich we're gonna tax the rich and and that always sounds good to the
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:31.800]  low-income people if you let them let the government tax the rich and leave us
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.880]  alone well it never works that way they might say that they're going to tax the
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:43.120]  rich but it's always the always the lower echelon in the economy that get the
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:50.760]  taxes and you know anytime that congressmen and senators talk about
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:57.440]  tax reform it means just one thing and that is a tax increase all right let me
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.920]  stop you read we've got to go to break here in a moment but I need to add this
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:06.880]  caveat look at Dominique Strauss-Kahn $3,000 and I hotels you know jets all
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:10.800]  over the world on US and European taxpayers that's who fund the
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.600]  organization and he's the socialist leader of France set to beat Nicholas
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:21.600]  Sarkozy in the next election till this latest a purported event with him and
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:29.120]  the sodomizing the lady now now there's an example right there the socialist
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:33.680]  leader is an international banker known for getting countries deep into debt out
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:37.200]  of fiat they make out of nothing and there's the communist manifesto what's
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:43.800]  it want a private central bank a graduated income tax government
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:51.200]  education all the things that we have because this is how the bankers come
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:56.560]  in and take over your nation they put in this income tax to be paid to them
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:00.120]  we'll be right back with red backman we're gonna talk about some other key
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:04.200]  areas as well hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now

[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.160]  Aaron Dice has got a big report up Lieberman will have questions about a
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:10.480]  Lockhees post 9-11 Pentagon dinner this is I kept saying two months sometimes I
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:15.320]  get stuff backwards two weeks after 9-11 when he was on the news as the
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:19.040]  number three guy in Al Qaeda all over the news the leader of American Al Qaeda
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:22.960]  and he's secretly hanging out at the Pentagon with the Secretary of the Army
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:27.560]  and there's more news out today from Watson new Al Qaeda leader claims he has
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:33.600]  nothing to do with Al Qaeda calls 9-11 a fabrication evidence suggests the new
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:40.120]  figure is another intelligence ghost looking at that red why do you think
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:45.080]  they're getting so wild now announcing TSA to be on the streets groping little
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:50.360]  girls sticking their hands down their pants groping Ron Paul Jesse Ventura
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:53.680]  hyping domestic terror I mean I think they're really getting ready for some
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.440]  staged terror here that's clearly in the cards we've never White House you know
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:01.160]  memos talking about how great it would be these are very sick people but do you
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:04.240]  think this is being done from a point of weakness or they think they've got us
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:12.080]  licked I think it's a weakness on their part I think that they they are
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:25.120]  underestimated the American people and the power of the people to you know to
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:33.600]  counter what they're doing and speak out and of course you know top radio the
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:41.640]  little underground newspapers the Internet my goodness that you know the
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:47.960]  Internet is alerting you know hundreds of millions of people about what's going
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:56.320]  on and I think that the elitist they underestimated all of this and of course
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:03.320]  I I just think that they're up in a panic situation because the world
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:11.680]  has gotten just so small now that where are they gonna go to hide where where is
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:19.280]  there on this planet that they can go and hide and not not be discovered where
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:28.880]  they're at and and followed up it just it's an impossibility for them to find
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:34.440]  any any safe place because they're gonna need a safe place if they're gonna
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:41.200]  survive and and there is no safe place I'm absolutely convinced of it the anger
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:48.560]  of the people and it isn't just in the United States the anger is building up
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:54.480]  and no matter where you go on this planet and so there's not too many places
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:58:00.920]  for the for the elite behind it that's right like that idea well read that's
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:05.520]  right I have a lot of guests I respect on but they still have this view that the

[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.480]  not invincible they are just ruthless and then we're gullible and don't stand up
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:18.680]  to them and look at what's happening in many other areas of the world people are
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:25.800]  angry and I folks I am well known people know what I look like many other

[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:42.320]  lot of other news dr. buzzbee joins us to break down just the fact that
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:46.120]  focusing was even worse than we thought turns out the establishment knew how
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:50.720]  bad it was day one there was a meltdown and they just lied the whole time it's
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:55.680]  just it's so incredible you notice the u.s. government the military in Japan
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:59.320]  wouldn't release any numbers when they knew exactly what was going on that was
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:04.640]  the big telltale sign right there but this thing's far from over but because
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:11.160]  this invisible killer is drifting over here building up every day and the feds
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:17.640]  aren't releasing numbers we just aren't a lot of trouble but going back to red on
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:23.200]  the point of people waking up again I'm like a litmus test because people do
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:29.840]  know what I look like and just everywhere old young black white Hispanic
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:35.400]  Asian I mean I can go in a restaurant a lot of nights I'll be coming home at
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:40.320]  five six o'clock once a week I'll pick dinner up twice a week sometimes my wife
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.880]  calls it in you know I go in you know sit out at the bar to pick the food up
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:49.760]  and the waitress is a listener and everybody sitting at the bar listeners
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.920]  no matter where I go and people run up to me and then I'm walking in the
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:57.200]  parking lot and people are stopping cars and again it's not like oh look alex
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:01.440]  jones is this big star that's not what this is about it's showing that that
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:05.600]  sonar peeing that we're having a huge effect I could be in Canada I can be in
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.440]  Honduras I could be in Belize I could be in Mexico I could be in the virgin
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:14.920]  islands I could be everywhere I've gone I can be in England I mean even in
[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:18.520]  England I was in England five six years ago and a lot of people come up to me but
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.680]  nothing like it is now in closing red this is very exciting times to be in
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:32.720]  absolutely you know I've been in the you know fully active full time for about
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:39.640]  35 years or so on there's never been a time like this where the where the
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:45.160]  people are waking up and they're listening you know it used to be that
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:50.840]  their hearing was so bad they didn't hear but when they get pinched in the
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:57.280]  economic advice then their hearing gets better and we're seeing that happen
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.360]  right now I'm sure your audience has been multiplied many times over because
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:10.840]  it's a very good source of information for people well I just know the reason I
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:14.920]  every few weeks you explain that to folks is people feel like they're alone
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:19.160]  ladies and gentlemen you're not alone I mean if I can get off an airplane in
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:26.240]  New York or LA or Minneapolis St. Paul and I can't get 15 feet I mean I've
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:29.120]  been places with Jesse Ventura people are running up to him they're running up
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:33.680]  to me I walk out of the bathroom either run up to me Ventura's what you know
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:39.040]  sitting there by his bags or 15 people around him I mean it's and they're
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.920]  they're liking Ventura because of his show exposing the New World Order I mean
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:50.000]  that's the point I'm trying to get at here is that is that I mean the numbers
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.080]  of people that are awake are much higher than we even know but one of the
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:57.600]  last dominoes to fall the system's already lost its credibility Congress
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:02.880]  with a 9% approval rating mainstream media falling apart dinosaur dying but
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.360]  the last domino to fall is we don't realize how much power we've got and I
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.960]  think that's the big secret red well that's why I say that you know there's more
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:21.480]  of us than there is of them that we're a majority and we we can use that
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:28.560]  confidence that we get when we recognize that we're a majority we need all the
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:36.680]  confidence we can get and of course history is on our side we can you know

[02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:08.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:13.240]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:17.240]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:21.680]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:25.920]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:29.680]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:33.800]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:37.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:20.280]  red Beckman's our guest here just a few more minutes that are on your phone
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:26.520]  calls and because red started making the point that history is on our side this
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:30.880]  is where the greatest development in human liberty ever took place that's
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:34.720]  why the system attacks the founding of this republic and you know looks at the
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:37.960]  problems but compared to everything else that came before it it is the
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:42.880]  greatest expression of private property family liberty the right to self-defense
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:47.560]  revolutionary ideas it was only the kings the nobles in every culture that
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:51.720]  had rights everybody else was seen as animals and slaves and red was starting
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:58.480]  to make that final point red Beckman when the USSR went down in December of
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:09.360]  1991 it could have turned into a chaotic situation but it did because the the
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:17.080]  powers that be were such a small minority that they used to they just
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:28.480]  didn't have the power to maintain control of the masses in Romania that was the
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:35.960]  Christmas time of 89 that dictator that had ruled with an iron fist in that
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:42.680]  country found himself dead laying in the snow because the firing squad were run
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:49.240]  by the military had put him out of his misery and it was because the people
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:53.920]  took to the streets they went and said we've had enough and we're the majority
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:59.840]  and so you're gonna have to back off and this is the same thing that's gonna
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:07.560]  happen right here I think that our military they know they have been beat
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:16.360]  up and drugged around you know Iraq and Afghanistan these guys are not coming
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:24.480]  home as happy campers I'll tell you and so and of course you go back in history
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:32.840]  Magna Carta came in 1215 AD King John in England was a tyrant and his own his
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:39.520]  own bureaucrat his own administrators they call them the barons they put
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:47.520]  together the Magna Carta which is still a great charter of England and between
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:57.160]  1215 AD and 1776 when our American War of Independence started there was no
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:04.320]  less than 43 times that the that the people had to bring their king and
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:09.960]  their government back under the law back under Magna Carta there was 23 of
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:17.080]  those 43 times that they had to take the sword and use the sword and they
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:22.240]  actually shed blood they beheaded one of their kings because he refused to come
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:28.480]  back under the law and so we have a great law the Constitution and there
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:34.480]  are Bill of Rights and all these are great great documents and they are the
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:43.760]  the backbone of our society here our political world and these elitists they
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:49.520]  cannot survive if we the people start to enforce the Constitution and the Bill
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:54.400]  of Rights and it's happening and of course one of the great things has
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:12:03.080]  happened when we started recognizing that federal judges are government agents
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:08.600]  they are government employees and so they are government agents and when they
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:13.240]  made this ruling the other day that cops couldn't go into a house without a
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:20.080]  warrant if that if that doesn't prove that these guys in the Supreme Court if
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:27.120]  that doesn't prove that they are government agents their agents of the
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:31.440]  government and they have a conflict of interest if there is any kind of a
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:38.640]  controversy between the citizen and the government the the judge the federal
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:45.040]  judge has his conflict of interest and it is a jury that is to make the finding
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:53.520]  of facts and conclusions of law and so when we have an informed jury we know
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:59.200]  that the government the government agent sitting there in his black dress he's
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:03.440]  not going to be able to control that jury he's not going to be able to control
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:09.880]  the evidence and he is going to be put in his proper position and that is as they

[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:57.280]  okay let's jam in some phone calls thanks for holding Jonathan in Kansas
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:04.400]  Jonathan you're on the air hey Alex I have some things to talk about concerning
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:11.160]  9-11 it's probably a good idea that you get a pin in a piece of paper because I
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:18.960]  found this two documents by krypton.org that came out in January about 9-11
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:25.040]  and it deals with prior knowledge and well I don't think many I don't think many
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:30.080]  of the patriot sites have really covered it oh there's so much evidence of it
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:33.080]  being an inside job you're right the ground is littered with it what are
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:42.240]  these documents okay one is called you go into Google and you type in
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:51.720]  krypton.org and then you have WTC 7 collapse described and where it has
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:58.640]  this engineer by the name of who's the engineer of World Trade Center 7
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:07.200]  named Mike Catalano he was employed by a guy named was Peter Mulroy who served
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:14.240]  as the head of security for Solomon Smith and Barney and he talked about he
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:22.480]  talked about how Silverstein had a heated exchange with one of his men at the
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:29.480]  day of 9-11 as his name was Marty M I don't know what his last name was but
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:37.640]  it's Marty M and he was using they got an heated exchange because that he was he
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:42.920]  was a representative for Silverstein and Silverstein was arguing with him because
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:47.240]  he said they had to get out some good bad was gonna happen he was telling them
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:52.640]  that and that Marty M said he didn't understand why he was the heated
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:59.680]  exchange and but eventually they ended up going. Is this an FBI document or what
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:09.480]  is it? It was actually it was at the meeting with former head of smuggs
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:17.920]  Solomon Smith Barney security it was a briefing and is prepared by this I
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:23.360]  believe I think a woman named Emily Walker. No I understand that I mean is
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:30.560]  this a FBI interview document? I'm not too sure. I mean who was it declassified
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:37.240]  by? Why was it classified? Declassified? I'm not too sure it they just didn't I'm
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:40.720]  not so sure but here's the other time. I mean Kryptom's a great side it's the
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:44.440]  original WikiLeaks but and we've had the founder of a John Young on quite a few
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:49.640]  times so my point is I'm familiar with a lot of the stuff that already went on
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:54.200]  from witnesses that we've had on some of which mysteriously die right after we
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:59.240]  have them on I should add but specifically I mean the document if
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:03.920]  it's declassified it will say where it was declassified from I know they had
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.360]  after-event interviews you know the FBI interviewed thousands of people so I
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:10.800]  would imagine that's probably where this came from but it should have a
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:14.400]  description on the document to say when it was declassified or are you saying
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.840]  this is a leak document but I'll certainly glad you called with that. What's
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:23.600]  the second document? I should search WTC 7 collapse described and then add
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.360]  kryptom.org into the search behind it got that what's the second one quick. The
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:35.280]  second one Alex is you type in kryptom.org you put space con-ed with a
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:44.720]  dash between con-ed and con-ed energy it's the first document you'll see it
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:47.720]  will con-ed energy. Now they had a generator in the building so what so
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:54.840]  what do they say? They say that they had control of I think the power grid if
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:00.560]  for New York Stock Exchange yes in that area where the area where Bowling Green
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:06.600]  Park is is they they all that like the power grid was down and what's so
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:11.440]  interesting about that area is that it has been historically known for having
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:17.400]  architectural firms on that so I always thought that was interesting that that
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:22.480]  power grid would be down the day architectural firms I guess people they
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:27.840]  didn't want people to know that if there was some architect representing them
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:33.480]  meet question why it fell like that and you're saying the power was out before
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:39.160]  the plane set like they know that they they took it down during the time the
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:44.080]  plane sits apparently that's what I'm oh the document says they decided to cut
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:50.040]  the power yes all right I'll have to look into both of those thank you so much
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:55.280]  I meant to get to more calls but Jonathan was intriguing Damon Dusterie Steve

[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:01.880]  South Carolina Damon you're on the air
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:08.240]  hey Alex I was just listening to red talking and please don't take this the
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:13.760]  wrong way but unfortunately I'm not as optimistic as he is and I think that the
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:21.480]  writing is on the wall when he refers to how in you know history the the
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:27.720]  surf so to speak have thrown off the chains of slavery and you know beheaded
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:34.800]  that king or had a revolution and whatnot the ultimate equalizer the firearm
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:38.760]  was pretty much the same between the military and the average person who had
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:44.120]  a farm and a cow and two acres you know they had some cannons but it was all
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:48.000]  pretty simplistic you know military against each other as far as weapons go
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:54.480]  nowadays I mean you know not that I want a violent uprising but if it comes to
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:58.800]  that for us to defend our rights by the Constitution with the government the
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:03.240]  numbers and the technology on the government side of all the whole world
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:08.040]  you know China US what have you is far outweighing to that of the people all
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:12.240]  right you know I here's the deal I've studied quite a bit of military history
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:19.920]  guerrilla warfare total resistance I've interviewed many retired and current
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:27.520]  special forces people I've studied Vietnam and other areas and actually if
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:32.160]  you have a motivated even minority that is willing to fight and die in
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:36.800]  asymmetrical warfare they've got to park those tanks they've got to park those
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:42.160]  helicopters the military likes to go in bars I mean I hate to use
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:46.360]  a Hollywood example but something like red dawn is is actually pretty close
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:51.960]  when you have the initiative to kill people and they don't know when you're
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:56.400]  gonna strike you're completely unstoppable now I don't even want to go
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.240]  that direction I want to wake the military and police up but the system
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:03.960]  is gearing up the military and police for the American people the system's
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:08.000]  also worried that a lot of military and we've now learned and learn the names
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.080]  that quite a few units refused to confiscate guns during that beta test
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:17.200]  in Katrina and and when they do these surveys will you fire Americans the
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:22.360]  majority say no that's why they signed a deal ten years ago nine years ago and
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:26.480]  then again three years ago then the Ottawa citizen Reuters AP it's in my
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:29.840]  film road to tyranny to use foreign troops in America people are always
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:34.920]  like yeah foreign troops folks it's official they they give speeches at
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:38.440]  West Point getting the troops ready for it they want to bring foreign troops in
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:43.480]  that's even better then it's really clear that this is an occupation if it
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:48.240]  goes to that now for people like myself I mean if it goes into this stuff I'm
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:55.360]  deader than a doornail but that's just the way it is and I just I mean I'm not
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:59.440]  trying to be mean to you but have you studied Damon asymmetrical war I mean
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:07.560]  aren't you I mean maybe you are from the military or from a historical Gorilla
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:14.080]  warfare type system and perhaps you can you can tell me where I'm wrong here's
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:21.080]  the thing your points are all well-spoken and taken of course but the
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:26.240]  point is this you know you look at Vietnam the Vietcong the VC they were
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:32.400]  being funded and supported by you know who you know the Soviets the the Chinese
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:38.560]  the they had support behind them the problem we have today is first of all
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:42.800]  to your military point my nephew graduated from Fort Benningdon in
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:47.840]  Georgia last summer we have so many kids in like the 18 to 25 year olds right
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.760]  now they're like they're gung-ho about getting in the military and killing
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:54.640]  people no no they play video games they fantasize about it so they go and join
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:29:01.960]  look I got to tell you I read Beckman is a veteran and I have studied the
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:09.280]  war college reports on it the last the globalist aren't gonna have a straight
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:12.760]  up gorilla war with the American people they're gonna commit a bunch of atrocities
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:17.840]  it's not gonna be the helicopters and tanks and hellfire missiles that would
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:21.720]  beat the American people it's gonna be a psychological war the Pentagon's on
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:25.680]  record saying 90% of war is now psychological it was always part
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:29.760]  psychological they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on the American
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:35.040]  resistance to win the hearts and minds of the public so that's what we face is
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:39.200]  them blowing up churches blowing up federal buildings with daycares blaming
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:44.200]  it on us during that war killing cops for no reason saying we did it it is not
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:47.280]  gonna be them beating us militarily it's gonna be a
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:30:03.880]  chai war fight the right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in
[02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:09.280]  2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he
[02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:13.280]  says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:16.520]  educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own
[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:20.280]  family now this man has made some outrageous predictions of the years the
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:24.660]  crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:27.920]  panty may Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:32.760]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:36.400]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and
[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:40.360]  most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this
[02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:44.000]  enough you should at least watch this free video online today he explains
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.160]  everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect

[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:06.160]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:10.720]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:14.680]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've
[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:19.720]  turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:25.000]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:29.520]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:34.200]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:38.240]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:41.920]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:47.000]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:53.040]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[02:32:58.520 --> 02:33:05.520]  dot TV
[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:24.040]  thank you for all the joy and pain picture show
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:31.480]  second balcony was the place with me I was just thinking
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:39.440]  go Dutch tree as we went live how crazy it is that they the US government the
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:44.600]  European governments they're raising the safe level of now what they say is safe
[02:33:44.600 --> 02:33:49.840]  and that's exactly what dr. Chris Busby said that they would do over a month ago
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:56.080]  here on this broadcast he advises the BBC advises the EU very prominent
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:04.640]  researcher I guess nuclear chemical engineer dr. Busby we're gonna be speaking
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:10.840]  with him here in just a moment because we're being bathed in higher and higher
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:14.240]  levels of radiation and they're just waving that magic wand saying no problem
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:17.800]  it's kind of like the US government admits they've just changed the ratios
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:21.680]  of unemployment it's really 22 plus percent according to every private
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:26.560]  estimate but they say no we just say it's 9% and we say inflation is 2% when
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:32.520]  it's more like 10% everybody knows there's inflation it's ruled by lawyers
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:35.840]  we're gonna be talking to mr. Busby dr. Busby about these amazing
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:42.280]  developments in just one moment first off though I want to tell the listeners of
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:49.760]  this radio broadcast about osteo K and it's a product the drug companies don't
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:54.040]  want you to know about it's called osteo K and it was created by physicians from
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:35:00.800]  Harvard Cornell MIT and others and backed by more than 20 years of clinical
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:05.360]  research osteo K is an osteoporosis supplement shown a decrease according to
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:08.440]  studies they have on their site fractures by 87% without any of the
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:13.360]  dangerous side effects of medications this is truly a revolution that takes
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:17.280]  the power away from big pharma with all their toxic drugs and puts it in your
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:22.960]  hands friends osteoporosis is a deadly disease but I could tell you the most
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:26.960]  effective approach for protecting your bones is not the drugs it's osteo K

[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:30.480]  tv what do you say to something this big this out in the open this naked the
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:37.600]  the the hubris it turns out the Japanese newspapers are reporting that and took
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:41.680]  and tepco admits that they knew that 16 hours after earthquake was the first
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:47.000]  meltdown since then they've admitted at five of the reactors explosions fires
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.280]  partial meltdown some of the cores 70% exposed others that have broken out of
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:57.680]  the chambers and fully melted into the earth more explosions more fires more
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:01.960]  smoke and you've got to go to the local Japanese news even find it and watch the
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:08.160]  webcams it's not even news here in the United States meanwhile they've raised
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:16.520]  the levels of what they say is normal or safe and some isotopes the FDA EPA has
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:21.360]  raised it a thousand times what it previously was one isotope a hundred
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:26.280]  thousand others 25,000 we've gone through and listed off the EPA's websites the
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:29.240]  main one what they've done the only reporting we're getting is from states
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:34.640]  and this was a month ago 181 times safe levels radioactive iodine 300 times
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:39.520]  radioactive nickel I mean we've gone over the state reports and the feds their
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:43.280]  answer is just say you know what you can have a hundred thousand times what we
[02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:50.040]  previously said it's magic and and it shows a major change in the in the way
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:53.800]  these systems operate and that's what dr. Busby age I mean I've got to give him
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.480]  credit he really didn't stick his neck out he did the research but but some
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:01.600]  said he did at the time when he went public worldwide and said look this is
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:04.560]  already bigger than Chernobyl we're talking a week or two in month and a
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:08.800]  half ago he went public and said there has been nuclear explosions atomic
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:12.480]  explosions there and gave examples of where that's happened before in Russia
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:17.080]  and the isotope readings and top scientists he's interviewed he then
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:20.400]  said this is how they will counter it they will simply raise what they say is
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:24.360]  safe because what they already say is safe isn't safe from all the studies and
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.800]  then he talked about infertility exploding and that that perhaps is really
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:31.760]  what they're after dr. Busby is a British scientist known for his theories
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:35.540]  about the negative health effects his theories a very low-dose ionizing
[02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:39.160]  radiation this is what Wikipedia says Busby is the director of green audit
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:42.440]  environmental consultancy agency and scientific advisor to the low-level
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:47.960]  radiation campaign LL RC org and he also advises the BBC and others he
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:52.000]  obtained his BS in chemistry with the first-class honors from the University
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.880]  of London and then did research at the welcome foundation applying
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:00.280]  spectrographic and analytical methods to chemical pharmacology and molecular
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:04.640]  drug interactions he became an elected member of the Royal Society of Chemistry
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:09.160]  he later gained the PhD in chemical physics he's a chemical physicist
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:16.120]  University of Kent researching ramen spectro electrochemistry and he joins
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:20.560]  us LL RC org has all the documents but you've been proven right in spades
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:25.680]  they're now saying many times worse may melt down for years building a big tent
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:30.040]  trying to contain it but it's not even and you predicted what they would do
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:33.760]  raising what they say is safe even though their head scientist quit the
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:37.600]  advisor to the president and prime minister and said they're telling kids
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:43.440]  12 miles away to keep living there and but but but dr. Busby there's the intro
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:47.720]  preface you've been absolutely right so break it down and tell us where we're
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:52.480]  going I mean next they may say uranium should be an additive in in serial to
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:55.080]  fortified children's bones
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:09.440]  oh dear it's all quite bizarre I agree with you and we do know now from
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:17.200]  measurements and from analysis of videos and isotopic ratios and all of
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:20.520]  these things that we can look at which are published thank you thanks to the
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:24.480]  internet and all the people who are doing these measurements and and releasing
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:28.720]  this stuff we know pretty well now what's happening and what's what's happened
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:33.200]  is that there are have been a number of nuclear explosion that's what you call
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:39.080]  atomic explosions we know this from the isotopic ratios of substances which
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:43.680]  have been measured in the air we know even now that some of these very
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:47.600]  exotic isotopes which have very very short half lives could not possibly
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:55.760]  exist in detector systems in America or in Japan or even in Europe if it were
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:59.400]  not for the fact that there was ongoing fission taking place so there's very very
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:04.160]  hot fuel which is fissioning and and we see videos ladies sent me a video
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:09.320]  recently of smoke coming out of these reactors and now these puffs of smoke
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:15.080]  are consequence of if you like to call them that but nevertheless these are
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:21.640]  fissioning fissioning events and we'll be producing smoke which is particles I
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:24.880]  mean when you see you when you see a bonfire and you see you see the blue
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:29.520]  smoke from a bonfire what you're looking at is carbon particles and this is
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:32.800]  grey smoke and blue smoke and black smoke that comes out of these reactors are
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:36.960]  particles now one of the most serious events which occurred actually occurred
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:43.880]  in reactor three about on the 21st about a week after the and it wasn't reported
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:48.840]  except in terms of white smoke the IAA said there's white smoke coming out of
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:55.840]  reactor building and shortly after that we followed that we tracked this using
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:00.480]  using plume modeling down through to Tokyo and found there was a sharp increase
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:05.040]  in radiation and and the radiation stayed high so in other words it was
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:09.320]  something that came there and stayed there and we now know that at least with
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:13.040]  it was a great deal of cesium 137 which is on the ground in Tokyo and even to
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:20.360]  the south of Tokyo it's really it's really a massive a massive a massively
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:23.040]  dangerous event and there's been a massive cover-up and that cover-up is
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:27.640]  still going on these particles are traveling all around all around the
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:31.480]  globe they've certainly been picked up in Europe and they will contain our
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:35.280]  permitting particles uranium and plutonium and and all the all the fission
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:39.200]  products associated with those connected with those with those fish with
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:45.040]  those and not everyone will get hit by one but if you inhale one you're a dead
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:49.960]  duck according to the nuclear physicist in radiations doctors scientists we've
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:54.440]  had on that you absorb one of these with uranium and plutonium and say into
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:59.760]  your lungs lung cancer is coming within a few years to a decade it it's just
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:04.760]  incredible and it's not even in the news now but the states that are studying
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:10.000]  milk and in Vermont and on on the east coast of the u.s. and in other states
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.600]  over a month ago picked up all sorts of deadly isotopes but everybody's just
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:19.080]  frolicking around dancing and saying everything's fine well the trouble is
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:23.080]  you can't see this stuff and you know if you look at the videos of people who
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:27.320]  drive into the if you like the exclusions and run to Kashima it looks
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:30.400]  perfectly normal you have a few dogs talking about wagging their tails and
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:33.920]  so on and I mean you can't see anything at all but if you could see something
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:37.680]  and say if this stuff was sparkling or if it was if it was fluorescent or
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:40.760]  something it would be quite terrifying you'd be walking into a sort of radioactive
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:49.400]  inferno of color I think that they have to know as a sort of in some kind of
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:55.760]  global way provide enough resources to put something over the top of this and
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:00.080]  keep it all in there has to be some containment it's no it's not long it's
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:04.040]  no longer possible to just leave it and keep raising the limit what about
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:10.000]  megatons of concrete instead of a tent what about building a literal pyramid of
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:15.880]  concrete on top of those yeah I think the problem there is that you have to
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:19.680]  isolate it in some way so that's that's the react but you have to cool it you
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:24.000]  see all the reactions will get worse and you can't you can't you can't stop a
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.120]  nuclear reaction by just covering up the concrete because of course you've got
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:30.880]  the earth underneath it and the groundwater so it will just produce an
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:34.440]  awful lot of stuff which will just then leak out into the ocean so my feeling is
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:39.360]  that they have to provide some kind of enclosure over the top of it and continue
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:43.600]  to cool it and then also they can capture it they can put some sort of
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:49.080]  control controlling a case on down around it to sort of limit it the
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:52.920]  ability of this stuff to get out but as they admit it's so radioactive they keep
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:57.000]  pulling the people out now it's very secretive they're restricting
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.680]  media and so we have no idea even really what they're doing
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:05.400]  I agree with you I agree with you it's a nightmare and I mean I wish I could say
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:08.640]  do this do that or do the other which I could have some kind of positive
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:13.840]  suggestion that might be useful I don't really it is out of control and the idea
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:17.960]  that the Japanese government is going to take nine months to control it just leaves
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:23.120]  me falling about laughing this is a global catastrophe and I don't have any
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:27.520]  answers I don't but I tell you one thing that I do that I can say and that is at
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.600]  the risk model that's currently being used in order to advise people about how
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.760]  much radiation they can be exposed to like you said that being increased all
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:40.440]  the time that that that is completely wrong but these people are going to
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:44.360]  suffer horribly as a result of their exposures and if they don't get away
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:48.040]  from where they are now at least outside the 200 kilometers and then certainly
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:52.320]  other parts of the country where this stuff has appeared sporadically because
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:56.240]  that's how it works it's a bit of a patchy business we found it's out for
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:00.720]  Tokyo incidentally that then they then they're going to be a lot of debt so I
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:05.160]  think and I think that it's criminally irresponsible of these people to just
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:10.640]  bolster up the continued idea to have a nuclear future at the expense of the
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:13.840]  lives of these people. Well that was my next point that was my next point I'm
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:17.040]  and then I'm gonna get into the model because that's the big hoax and coverup
[02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:20.720]  here but just a month or so ago it was like oh they're gonna cancel the
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:24.760]  reactors the new ones in the US oh we're gonna look at these dangerous designs
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:28.920]  and now it's almost like well that's over with see it's not a big deal when
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:32.880]  they blow up let's build more it's kind of kind of fun to have one blow up in
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:37.280]  your country George Mombiat using psychological warfare says it's liberal
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:41.920]  and good this makes me want it and people say well that sounds crazy no they
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:45.880]  realize that a lot of the public now just goes off how you act so if you dance
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:50.120]  around and say I have cyanide pills people line up and take them I think
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:56.160]  you're absolutely right I think there is some kind of magical process taking
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:01.760]  place here where akin to the emperor's new clothes if you recall they're
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:06.120]  presenting something which is balmy and people are swallowing it merely because
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:09.320]  it's being presented again and again and again and again like some sort of
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:12.320]  cracked record and of course they're not telling us the truth about these
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:17.400]  materials that are coming out and they're not even releasing the results of
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:21.200]  measurements in Europe anymore we were having to use freedom of information
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:25.080]  acts and questions in parliament to try and get out the data to see what's
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:32.120]  happening over here or even make the measurements ourselves it's a cover-up
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:36.720]  it's a scary business it's a scary business but I mean it's not the only
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:41.440]  cover-up I mean the world at the moment is in a very bizarre state altogether
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:45.480]  not just from the point of view Fukushima no we've now had leaks in
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:51.080]  Canada and in the US and now because of Fukushima it's not even an event they
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:54.880]  say yeah we released all this radiation in the lake keep eating the fish it's
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:48:01.240]  fine it's almost like it's gotten to the point now where it's past say and I mean
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:06.520]  society's really gotten in a trance like state dr. Busby break down the models
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:10.120]  because as you said a month and a half ago here you said the model of what they
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:16.240]  say is safe isn't safe but you watch they'll raise the levels and so even if
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:20.880]  we go by their old model that okay this is a safe level how can they then get
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:24.920]  away with saying well now we're going to raise what is safe I mean that is just
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:30.640]  on its face utterly asinine but they're doing it well this is how they do it but
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:35.860]  the model is based that they use is based on external radiation microcevas
[02:48:35.860 --> 02:48:39.840]  per hour if you like or overall dose so you know if you have like 10 hours it's
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:46.160]  10 microcevas and model is based on the survivors of the Hiroshima bomb so what
[02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:49.480]  they do is they say that the Hiroshima bomb survivors receive so many
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:54.120]  severs of radiation which is like a huge dose and then we got them and then we
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:58.120]  followed them for most of their life and we found this number of cancers so we
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:02.040]  say that this number of severs produces that number of cancers the problem is
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:06.240]  that that's an external radiation model and it's okay for external radiation
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:10.040]  probably actually probably isn't but anyway it's roughly right and if it
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:13.360]  weren't right then people who had x-rays in hospitals or people living in high
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:17.840]  background regions of the world suffering external radiation would have
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:21.920]  much higher levels of cancer than they do so we don't have a problem with that
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:25.480]  the problem is this for internal radionutrients for these particles that
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:31.320]  we're talking about the the the amount of dose that you get to very certain parts
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:34.880]  of your body and not other parts so in other words is what we call an isotropic
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:40.280]  so it produces a huge dose at one point but no dose somewhere else it's a bit
[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:44.000]  like sitting in front of a fire warming yourself and getting a dose dose is
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:49.200]  defined in terms of energy per unit mass so joules per kilogram or else we get
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:52.600]  the same amount of energy per unit mass by reaching into the fire and picking
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:56.480]  out a hot coal and eating it and this is the error that's been built into this
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:00.400]  model that they're using because it doesn't deal with the fact that internal
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:05.000]  radionuclides can either come in the form of particles and produce huge doses
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:08.960]  at the point where the particle is and no dose somewhere else or else they can
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:12.280]  actually bind to DNA and their number of these molecules a number of these
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:15.280]  atoms like strontium and uranium plutonium which actually have a very
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:20.120]  high affinity for DNA so when they come into your body when you inhale them and
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:23.120]  they get into the bloodstream through the lungs through the lymphatic system
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:26.920]  what they do is they bind to the DNA in the cells and so they deliver all their
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:31.960]  energy directly to the DNA you see and so that's like targeting it it's like
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:39.160]  targeting the very organ organ now well that's like saying absolutely and
[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:43.540]  that's exactly what dr. Doug Rocky who was the head of the Pentagon's
[02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:48.240]  radiation study program with DU explains is that it's the inhaling of it and then
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:52.840]  it just sits there at point blank range for the rest of your life frying the
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:56.840]  cells around it and you get a cancer right there and they're just saying it's
[02:50:56.840 --> 02:51:03.040]  fine it's wonderful a hundred thousand times levels better will I have garlic
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:07.120]  breath after I take Ali see we get that question all the time about the world's
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:11.720]  best garlic extract Ali see and the answer is Ali see contains stabilized
[02:51:11.720 --> 02:51:15.880]  Allison nature's antimicrobial agent and the active ingredient and crushed
[02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:19.600]  garlic but will not give you garlic breath scientifically proven and double
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:23.880]  blind studies using low doses of Allison greatly reduces the number severity and
[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:28.280]  duration of common colds our powerful Ali see contains 300 milligrams of
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:33.000]  stabilized Allison just one tablet of Ali see is equivalent to 40 garlic
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:37.640]  cloves it's effective against asthma MRSA bacterial fungal and viral infections
[02:51:37.640 --> 02:51:41.680]  and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol plus it's a natural
[02:51:41.680 --> 02:51:45.240]  mosquito repellent boost resistance to infection with nature's best garlic

[02:52:02.780 --> 02:52:06.680]  earthquake tsunami and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese
[02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:10.360]  citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:14.440]  hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:18.720]  of Americans becoming homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar while
[02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:22.440]  the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation our friends the National
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:26.080]  Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates
[02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:29.960]  Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy and inflation I urge you
[02:52:29.960 --> 02:52:35.520]  to sign up at the NIH free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:39.920]  not only survive but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis silver
[02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:43.400]  has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment
[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:48.320]  for the next decade on inflation dot US the NIA's team of expert economists are
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:52.000]  happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation debt

[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:04.120]  the original since 1976
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:26.280]  you'll be watching you globalist they do day one
[02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:29.960]  within the second day that there's been a total meltdown they know there's been
[02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:31.800]  all sorts of fishing going on i've
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:34.800]  seen them admit that the way dr buzzbee describes it
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:38.720]  other physicists we've talked to that there are these little atomic explosions
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:40.400]  and you get a really big one
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:43.760]  and then you saw the mock three reactor blow up on that Wednesday after and
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:45.920]  shoot fuel rods high in the sky
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:47.760]  later the japanese admitted yeah
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:51.120]  hundreds of thousands of them got blown up to a mile and a half away
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:53.880]  the japanese has buried them with bulldozers
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:58.400]  i mean this uh... dr buzzbee there's no doubt this dwarfs turn over correct
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:00.880]  yes correct
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:14.880]  and and uh... and uh... nuclear industry is hoping we just forget about it so they
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:16.400]  can build more of these things
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.960]  uh... when you got cut off by the break you were explaining
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:23.280]  what these radioactive particles do when they get no lungs or other tissue
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:26.760]  yeah i was describing the effect of a thing of a particle which we have
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:30.360]  actually discovered and identified from Fukushima in an air filter
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:34.280]  it's a particle containing the isotope americium 241
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:36.560]  which is an alpharometer
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:40.960]  and this substance this particular particle has a diameter of about half a
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:45.680]  micro of about two point about five microns so it's effectively a gas
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:49.320]  it can pass through the lungs into tissue when it gets in the body
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:53.760]  this particular particle has sufficient activity it's about some gig of becquerels
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:55.640]  per kilogram
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:00.520]  but it will not it will shoot out one alpha particle every second
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:03.500]  it's got an activity about one point five
[02:56:03.500 --> 02:56:06.760]  um... becquerels per part for the particle
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:11.400]  what that means is that each one of these alpha tracks will will go into tissue
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:14.800]  the local that three or four cells that are local to the particle because the alpha
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:21.800]  track doesn't travel very far so the base to those cells every
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:25.920]  uh... did we just lose dr busby
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:27.400]  that was weird
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:30.200]  uh... let's get him back on the line we'll do five minutes overdrive we have
[02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:32.600]  to we've got to get his testimony on record here
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.440]  folks uh... this guy's been one hundred percent on target
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:40.080]  but i was having him on a month and a half ago when he was uh...
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:43.040]  he was uh... laying all of this out
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:45.720]  and
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:49.760]  people are like all there had been multiple meltdowns all there's no problem
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:51.680]  and now it's all admitted
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:53.720]  in fact it's worse
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:57.760]  than we had said a tepco's admitting it uh... weeks ago that
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:00.320]  head advisor to the japanese government quit
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:01.840]  saying it's immoral
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:03.800]  to have kids still in the area
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:05.260]  left a whole dr busby
[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:08.720]  uh... five minutes the next hour doc you got cut off you were breaking uh...
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:11.120]  breaking down how many particles
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:13.600]  how many particles this thing shoots out
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:18.000]  uh... i don't i don't have any part of the company i mean i thought i have
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:21.360]  no i haven't done the calcare we don't think every second it's firing something
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:23.160]  billions of these particles
[02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:25.160]  more than billions of these particles
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:28.320]  uh... i i i think probably there's going to be at least a million of these
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:32.400]  particles for every single person in the two hundred kilometers area to get
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:33.880]  to an awful lot of particles
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:37.280]  but what about the part of it when they get inside you they produce a dose to
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:42.720]  the local tissue which is higher than the dose that they would have got to add that in the Hiroshima
[02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:45.120]  explosion in terms of external radiation
[02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:48.880]  but the point is that the current risk model deals with these particles as if they are
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:53.360]  external radiation and so they would say the dose is too low to affect you and this is a
[02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:56.320]  particular scam that is being used
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:58:00.160]  to allow people to be exposed to these sorts of external radiation
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:04.000]  these sort of internal radiation exposures from Fukushima
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:09.120]  it's it's it's dreadful it's terrifying
[02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:12.880]  what's the danger of these reaching say texas my little children
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:13.640]  um...
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:18.000]  yes there is a danger of them reaching texas i mean this stuff will go around
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:22.400]  will go around the globe unless it's contained unless they well i mean even now it already is
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:26.560]  probably in texas but but of course the probability that they inhale it will be
[02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:29.920]  proportional to the number of particles in a per cubic meter and there will be a lot
[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:33.120]  less in texas than it is in uh...
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:34.120]  in texas
[02:58:34.120 --> 02:58:35.120]  Dr. Busby
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:37.600]  we certainly found these in hawaii
[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:43.680]  i hear you we got a break we got a break stay there we'll put it back in one minute
[02:58:43.680 --> 02:58:47.120]  thank you for listening to GCN
[02:58:47.120 --> 02:58:51.200]  visit GCNlive.com today
[02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:54.960]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:58:54.960 --> 02:58:58.000]  generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.080]  easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:59:00.080 --> 02:59:04.320]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:08.640]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:11.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:15.760]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:19.760]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:59:19.760 --> 02:59:23.280]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:59:23.280 --> 02:59:26.960]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:59:26.960 --> 02:59:30.400]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:33.520]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:35.520]  generators offered by solutions from science
[02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:38.480]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[02:59:38.480 --> 02:59:42.960]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:42.960 --> 02:59:47.040]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:52.160]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:55.680]  coast to coast direct from austin
[02:59:55.680 --> 02:59:59.280]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[02:59:59.280 --> 03:00:01.280]  network
[03:00:01.280 --> 03:00:07.200]  what if i say i'm not like the others what if i say am i just another one of
[03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:11.040]  your planes you're the pretend you're what if i say i would
[03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:15.040]  have a surrender
[03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:31.120]  dr chris busby who has been 100 that on in fact if he's wrong
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:36.240]  it's that it was even worse than he said and he predicted everything they would
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:38.640]  do he predicted exactly what would continue to
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:43.360]  happen he said just a few weeks into it this thing could go for a year or more
[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:47.040]  a month later they came out and and tepco now admits it
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:51.200]  and we were talking about these particles and and yes texas
[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:54.560]  basically every state that's tested has found elevated
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:58.640]  levels of different isotopes and milk uh in surface
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:02.800]  produce like cabbage and lettuce and
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:09.200]  things like spinach and i've seen it as reports of 500 times safe levels
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:15.040]  of certain isotopes and the feds are releasing no data
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:18.880]  and that's real evidence of the cover up and we knew a week into it when the
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:22.000]  u.s military crawling all over that area with high tech
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:25.280]  detectors didn't say anything we've only got about two or three minutes left
[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:29.840]  dr busby you got cut off with talking about it's been found in hawaii
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:33.120]  uh and and we know that in northern hemisphere has twice the radiation of
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:36.240]  the southern just from chair noble i mean how long is this going to be going
[03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:39.760]  on and what do you think that the health the overall health effects will be
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:43.680]  i think the overall health effects will be very bad in japan i don't think the
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:46.960]  overall health effects will be quite so bad in the united states
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:50.480]  and uh in europe and i think the reason is because
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:54.560]  well because of the very long way downwind of of japan and there'll be a
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:01:58.160]  dilution of these particles but make no mistake these particles are already
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:01.680]  there and so long as these uh fissions take this
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:05.440]  fissioning takes take continues to take place and and the and the reactor
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:08.480]  they're uncovered then this stuff will get into the air and it will continue
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:11.840]  to come uh to to america and it will come to europe and of
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:15.280]  course it's cumulative so the more of it that comes the more of it it'll fall
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:18.160]  down into onto the ground and then it will continue to be
[03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:21.600]  resuspend it so the higher the probability will be that some people
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:24.400]  will inhale them so there will be some sort of effect
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:29.040]  um by by which i mean there will be an increase in cancer and leukemia and
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:33.520]  and other for another whole range of diseases associated so it'll take up
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:36.400]  on the chart now now now you you do think the
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:40.720]  tents are good idea because that'll keep some of the uh particulates down
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:44.000]  yes exactly i think it's the only way that they can deal with it now is that
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.880]  they can put it they put a dome over it they were the friendship designed a
[03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:49.840]  dome to go over the Chernobyl reactor incidentally the sarcophagus of the
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:53.360]  Chernobyl reactor is collapsing and there's a huge
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:57.440]  proposal and which is ongoing from the french to build a sort of
[03:02:57.440 --> 03:03:00.800]  sarcophagus over the sarcophagus and this could be done
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:04.000]  for Fukushima and i think the sooner the better because at least that will keep
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:07.360]  these particles inside it's the particles this is the one
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:10.640]  message i have it's the particles that are dangerous it's inhalation that's
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:14.560]  dangerous it's not external radiation external radiation gamma
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:17.920]  radiation is not dangerous well i mean it that it is but it's not anything
[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:21.520]  like as dangerous as the inhalation of these radioactive
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:24.480]  alpha well it's always it's the inhalation of the fallout
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:28.320]  it's not just the overall background that's why they have detectors that are
[03:03:28.320 --> 03:03:30.960]  showing normal level and the little particle goes by and it
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:34.560]  goes off the chart that's why we're seeing a lot of those reports it's this
[03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:38.960]  russian roulette of these particles you're right it's it's the inhalation
[03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:42.560]  dose that is the problem absolutely because that's not properly modeled by
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:46.000]  the icrp by the model that they're using in order to
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:49.120]  to limit people's exposure well you have to use the model of the european
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:52.320]  committee on radiation risk which accurately quantifies the health risk
[03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:56.800]  of exposure to these particles well you've done a great job and
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:00.880]  obviously they want the story to go away so they don't even have to
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:04.880]  even fix anything and and some of their policy people are just let it melt down
[03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:07.680]  forever and that's just the way it is and
[03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:10.960]  it's not going to go away alex it's not going to go away people are going to die
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:14.240]  and and it's going to become perfectly obvious that this is happening
[03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:17.040]  so the people who are saying that they're going to have to keep their fingers crossed
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:20.000]  and run like hell before these people who are dying come and get them
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:23.120]  yeah what do you think's going to happen to mombia and others when uh
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:27.120]  the radiation mombia shot himself in the foot very few people believe him here
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:31.040]  i mean i i've i've heard from many many people in the green movement but his
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:36.640]  his credibility has been completely exploded as a result of what he's done
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:40.400]  well thank you so much for joining us that's dr chris
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:45.360]  buzzbee and you can check out the key research and scientific facts at l l r c
