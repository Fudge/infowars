[00:00.000 --> 00:24.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are already in a civil war.
[00:24.500 --> 00:27.000]  The globalist do plan to overthrow Trump.
[00:27.000 --> 00:35.000]  There really is no whistleblower.
[00:35.000 --> 00:44.000]  This is just a leaker who followed procedures that have been established to give whistleblowers protection.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  The whole thing is a sham.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  It's nothing more than the steel dossier 2.0, as I have been saying all week.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  There are a couple of people now have come to this conclusion.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  It's the same people. It's the same scam. It's the same objective.
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  And I'm going to add a name to potential Democrat presidential nominees coming up soon.
[01:05.000 --> 01:12.000]  And now, from sunny South Florida, it's open lines Friday.
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  Bottom line, there isn't anything really new here. This is just the next phase of get Trump.
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  It's the next phase of the operation to overturn the election results of 2016.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  It's the same players. It's the same technique. It's the same play.
[01:30.000 --> 01:40.000]  The whistleblower report, it was probably prepared with the assistance of House Intelligence Committee staffers.
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  Nothing about this is genuine. There's no real whistleblower who's terribly alarmed and upset over what Trump said on a phone call.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  The whistleblower didn't even hear it. It's just the next phase.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  It's the same play run to the different side of the line. Let's put it that way.
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  And the whistleblower report is the steel dossier all over again.
[02:03.000 --> 02:12.000]  Some people think that it is the same technique Christine Bolsey Ford, but she was. That whole thing was an extension of the original play.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  What is this really all about? What is this really, really all about?
[02:18.000 --> 02:26.000]  It's all about overturning the election results of 2016. Why is that so important?
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  It goes beyond just the fact that the deep state lost.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  I think what it's about is what I have long thought it's about.
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  It's about making sure the American people do not learn.
[02:41.000 --> 02:50.000]  The extent of the corruption in the Obama administration and the Democrat Party at large and particularly among these people in the deep state
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  who did what they did to deny Trump his election victory.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  And that's why Pelosi is out there today saying that Bill Barr has gone rogue.
[03:01.000 --> 03:11.000]  If you need any evidence that they are scared to death of what Barr and his team are investigating as to the origins of all of this,
[03:11.000 --> 03:21.000]  Pelosi out of the blue saying that Barr has gone rogue. They are doing everything they can to destroy everybody on the other side of this.
[03:21.000 --> 03:30.000]  There's nothing that's true. What really is hard about this is that we're dealing with nothing but a series of abject lies.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  Everybody on the left is lying. Every allegation about this is a lie.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  Trump hasn't broken any laws. Trump has not engaged in any corruption.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  In fact, Trump is the most investigated president in the history of the country and they still haven't found a crime.
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  They're still looking for a crime. They haven't found a crime, so they're making things up.
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.000]  The media is not media. It's just Democrats who work in the media and the whole group of them is aligned.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  And what we are in the middle of now, folks, is a cold civil war.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  It has begun. It is a cold civil war as opposed to hot.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  There's no hostilities declared. There's no two clear sides of this.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  And certainly no shots have been fired.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  But nevertheless, we're in the midst of a cold civil war.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  And it has taken the, well, it encompasses a lot of things.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  It encompasses overturn the election results of 2016.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  It is about protecting and defending the deep state, the Washington establishment going forward.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  Their careers, their fortunes, their corruption.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  There are terribly big stakes involved here for these people.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  And Trump is on the cusp of overturning it and exposing it. They cannot allow that to happen.
[04:53.000 --> 05:11.000]  That is absolutely what's happening. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:23.000 --> 05:30.000]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted.
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.000]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.000]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum, and the globlest.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video.
[05:53.000 --> 06:19.000]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[06:19.000 --> 06:28.000]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:28.000 --> 06:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, September 30th, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  We're going to cover the astounding developments, not just here but around the world.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  We're going to open the phones up as well throughout the transmission today, the entire four hours of my broadcast.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  We have Owen Schreuer from right here in Austin, Texas, in the studio next door to me.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  He'll be broadcasting and transmitting out on TV and radio and the Internet.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  With the War Room and then 7 to 9, Will Johnson and Tom Pappert with firepower.
[07:02.000 --> 07:09.000]  And of course, David Knight, weekday mornings at 8 a.m. Central.
[07:09.000 --> 07:17.000]  If I just get up here and chatter off all the news, it really, I think, just becomes part of the background noise, doesn't it?
[07:17.000 --> 07:39.000]  President Trump tweeted out a couple days ago on Saturday that the United States is in danger of being in a new civil war.
[07:39.000 --> 07:48.000]  And Rush Limbaugh said that we're in a cold civil war.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  Well, both of those statements, depending on your perspective are true.
[07:54.000 --> 08:04.000]  But let me tell you from the broadcast that first said this back in July of 2016 when Trump became the nominee.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  I said, I believe Trump's going to win.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  And I believe that there then is going to be a civil war of some type in this country.
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  And how politically active we are will depend on how bad the crash landing is going to be.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  Because if you study history, dug in corrupt individuals like this have nothing to lose.
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  And they will end up trying to turn over the chessboard when they realize they're losing.
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  And I harped on that at nauseam.
[08:36.000 --> 08:44.000]  And I've probably aired it since 20 times on election night when Trump won.
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  Roger Stone looked at me in the studio next door and said, you look like you've been punched in the stomach. What's wrong?
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  And I said, Roger, we just got the beachhead. We just got on the beach at Norman to hear.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  This country did.
[08:57.000 --> 09:07.000]  And the machine guns are about to open up on us. And the howitzers, the big guns are about to open up.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  And no sooner had that night ended.
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.000]  But the orders went into place to trigger total civil war in this country.
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  And we have it in the WikiLeaks and we have it from the admissions of what's funding Hollywood.
[09:24.000 --> 09:35.000]  And the mere fact that the Communist Chinese and others are allowed to spend billions per quarter funding civil war mass death movies.
[09:35.000 --> 09:47.000]  New Netflix shows every couple days about murdering Trump supporters in mass and killing gun owners and putting us in forced labor camps.
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  I'll be covering some of that today.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  That's some of the stories right here in my stack.
[09:57.000 --> 10:08.000]  Netflix movie depicts time traveling liberals carrying out pre crime murder of patriots to prevent America uprising against globalism in the year 2020.
[10:08.000 --> 10:18.000]  If you go into the show and they're saying you've got to go out and kill all the conservative leaders before they stop the utopia world government that's being built.
[10:18.000 --> 10:27.000]  That's a highly funded pushed recommended by Netflix show with a star studded cast.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  And you look at who owns a large portion of the production house.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  The Chinese Communist government.
[10:36.000 --> 10:48.000]  You see you can't make that up can you. And they've got all these movies and all these shows.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  Like the purge and the hunt.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  Where the evil right wingers have got to be killed.
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.000]  And then President Trump comes out and says if you do that, it's going to trigger a civil war.
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  And the usual suspects come out and say.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  Oh, that's a conspiracy theory. Nobody's calling for violence.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  Oh, Governor Weld called for Trump to be arrested and killed for treason.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  All these other Democrats are saying similar things.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  And then Trump goes well what you're doing is treason.
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  Through a quote whistleblower is really just a third party storyteller.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  Not even a leaker.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  None of the people that actually heard the phone call did a whistleblower.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  It's all made up.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  They then turn around.
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  And say that when Trump says you try this it'll cause a civil war that he's trying to invoke a civil war trying to intimidate them.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  When all Trump's doing is pointing out.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  What's going to happen.
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  Now when Trump means a civil war, he means a big bloody millions dead.
[12:01.000 --> 12:10.000]  Believe me, once the venerable civilization peels off, and once a shooting war starts, there's been a lot of Santa Clauses that have been making lists and checking it twice.
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  And no one who's naughty and nice and all the meth head devil worshipers and Congress people and globalists.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  I mean, the globalists have got their jets all warmed up on the tarmac.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  This is on record. They're going to not be here when this goes down.
[12:23.000 --> 12:31.000]  And that's what's so dangerous about this is the globalists and the chai comms funding all this really think they're going to get away with this.
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.000]  It's very important that they know they're not going to get away with it.
[12:38.000 --> 12:57.000]  When we come back, I'll play Governor Weld saying he wants to kill the president. We also play Phil Mudd and former deputy director of the CIA saying we're going to kill this guy or Chuckie Schumer saying the intelligence agencies have six ways to Sunday to get back at you.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  And that's what's going on.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  But we should talk about how we counter this and how we stop this and how we deal with it.
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  Now, I said three plus years ago, we were in a cold civil war, and it was beginning to get hot.
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  You can just type in cold civil war info wars.com into a search engine will pull up dozens of shows and articles with that in them.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  And I described it on a Richter scale of a one to 10.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  I said on a civil war were about a three in 2016.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  That's a civil war inside the government inside the deep state.
[13:29.000 --> 13:36.000]  And now we're at about a six in a cold civil war.
[13:36.000 --> 13:44.000]  But when it gets up to a seven, eight or nine, it then starts cooking off, pop it off, and then you get a hot civil war.
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  And I don't have any dreams or wishes for that.
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  I'd like to fix everything peacefully.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  I'd like to stop all this.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  But the globalists are in a mad frenzy.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  They smell their own blood, their own piss.
[14:00.000 --> 14:12.000]  And they understand that the clock is running out on them and that they committed all these crimes and that they're going to be defeated.
[14:12.000 --> 14:23.000]  And so like a giant squid trying to take its prey to the bottom of the ocean with it, it's wrapped around us like a face sucker from alien and is not going to go down without a fight.
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.000]  So we ought to have discussions about the most judicious proper response to this as a nation as a planet.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  And now we're going to deal with it because these people are psychotic control freaks.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  And Thomas Jefferson was once asked what is the limit to which tyrants will go.
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  And Jefferson rightfully said whatever level you will accept because there's no end to these people to private.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  There's no giving in.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  There's no making deals with them.
[14:52.000 --> 15:02.000]  These are a bunch of people who have had power for a long time, intergenerationally, who just don't know what they're doing and just can't stop and can't back down.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  And they want to be caught and they want to be destroyed and they're just power men.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  It's called megalomania.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  So what are we going to do?
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  They're not going to stop.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  They want to fight.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  It's existential.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  They believe they must dominate us.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  They must absorb us.
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.000]  They must mount our head on the wall to finally be successful.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  It's a little peepee syndrome.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  It's a Napoleon syndrome, a Hitler syndrome.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  Call it whatever you want.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  It's pure evil.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter's old messages worshiping Lucifer have come out.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  That's getting a lot of traction.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  We'll talk about that more coming up.
[15:45.000 --> 15:53.000]  But first I want to get to the type of civil war we're already in and what it's probably going to degenerate into if we don't do X, Y, Z.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  Newswars.com.
[15:55.000 --> 16:24.000]  Band on video.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:59.000 --> 17:08.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:08.000 --> 17:17.000]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:22.000 --> 17:34.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood water's back story.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.

[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.000]  I know most of you realize this but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[18:02.000 --> 18:12.000]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at M4s and we are the individuals that have done the research to understand the global battle plan and we know how to take them down.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  That's why they're so upset.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  Think how far we've come together.
[18:16.000 --> 18:26.000]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[18:33.000 --> 18:39.000]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience because you are truly activists in the arena.
[18:39.000 --> 18:47.000]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support, this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.

[20:27.000 --> 20:39.000]  All right, my friends, when you study history, you look back at all the huge wars and hundreds of millions dead and the horrible corrupt evil groups that would rise up and try to take power.
[20:39.000 --> 20:46.000]  And you would then burn across the planet's surface like a plague of locusts and then finally would be met.
[20:46.000 --> 20:53.000]  And then you'd have a new golden age. Once people had faced down evil again, they would get back to God, get back to morality.
[20:53.000 --> 20:59.000]  They try to change the world.
[20:59.000 --> 21:05.000]  And now here we are as a civilization and as a society.
[21:05.000 --> 21:25.000]  And we see all the classical evil growing up all around us, openly coming for our children, openly coming for our birthrights, openly telling us that they serve the devil.
[21:25.000 --> 21:35.000]  You know, I don't normally air a report twice in a row, but at the end of the Sunday show, I aired a special report that Paul Watson has tweeted out.
[21:35.000 --> 21:41.000]  Some of the greatest battles will be fought within the silent chambers of your own soul.
[21:41.000 --> 22:02.000]  Ezra Taft Benson learned who sold their soul to Satan. Very important report I put out. And that ties together with his tweet from 2006 by Jack from Twitter.
[22:02.000 --> 22:11.000]  Making the good pasta, reading through some amazing parts of the Satanic verses, the golden threads begin to intertwine.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  How beautiful.
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.000]  Sweet, sweet Satan.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  Jack Dorsey.
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  They sold their soul because they would carry out evil.
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.000]  They always tell you they're the good guys. That's coming up next segment.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  We're going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast after that.
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.000]  But let's play Governor Weld just last week saying Trump's guilty of treason.
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  Turns out all this is made up, but they don't care. They've got their impeachment going. They say they'll find something.
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  No matter how much corruption they're involved in, it's always about the people trying to get the country back under their control.
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  When the left doesn't just not care about America, they hate it.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  They hate the unborn. But they're the moral authority because they said so.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  So here's Governor Weld.
[23:03.000 --> 23:12.000]  He called up the president of Ukraine and pressed him eight times to investigate Joe Biden, who the president thinks is going to be running against him.
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  It couldn't be clearer. And that's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  That is treason. It's treason, pure and simple.
[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death. That's the only penalty.
[23:32.000 --> 23:42.000]  So Trump said in that speech to the diplomats on Friday, to the U.S. diplomats at the U.N., was surreptitiously filmed.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  You know, in the past, you know how we dealt with people engaged in treason. This is crazy.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  And they're openly working against the country. That's what globalists are.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  And against the person the people elected.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  And Schiff's putting out fake transcripts and reading them like they're real.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  And Trump's right. He needs to be impeached.
[23:58.000 --> 24:05.000]  Schiff is the one engaged in treason, trying to overthrow our elected system.
[24:05.000 --> 24:15.000]  But remember what Mudd said, a protege of Mueller from the CIA brought over to the FBI.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  The intelligence community is going to kill this guy.
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  Talking about Trump, here it is.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  One bottom line. As a former government official, government's going to kill this guy.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  He defends Vladimir Putin. Their State Department and CIA officers are coming home.
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  And at Langley and at Foggy Bottom, CIA and State, they're saying, this is how you defend us?
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  Government's going to kill this guy.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  See, they're the government. That's what Tucker Carlson rightfully said in a piece Friday.
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  That the bureaucracy thinks it's the government. And they don't care how you elect.
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  They've been overthrowing all these other foreign countries, starting all these wars so long.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  Trump says, hey, we're not doing that anymore.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  And they say, you know what, we'll overthrow you.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  Because they've been the ones parlaying and selling the country up.
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  Remember, just like Schumer said when President Trump was about to be inaugurated.
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  This was two days before Trump got inaugurated.
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  He's taking these shots, this antagonism, this taunting to the intelligence community.
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community. They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.000]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were more...
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  I don't know. But from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  And we need the intelligence community. We don't know what's going...
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  Look at the Russian hacking. Without the intelligence community, we wouldn't have discovered.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  The intelligence community we have has been brokering and selling this country out for 50 years and shipping narcotics in
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  and covering up giant child kidnapping range. It's all coming out.
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.000]  The intelligence community is a bunch of blue blood, leftist and globalist that hate this nation.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  The same sickos that run England.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  Here's Trump Saturday telling like it is. They're coming after me. He says, because I'm representing you.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  And Trump's betting on you and believes on you. Here it is.
[26:08.000 --> 26:15.000]  What's going on now is the single greatest scam in the history of American politics.
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  The Democrats want to take away your guns. They want to take away your health care.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  They want to take away your vote. They want to take away your freedom.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  They want to take away your judges. They want to take away everything.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  We can never let this happen. We're fighting to drain the swamp.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  And that's exactly what I'm doing. And you see why we have to do it.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  Because our country is at stake like never before. It's all very simple.
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  They're trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you and I'll never let that happen.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  Now, let's expand on that. If you read the emails Trump sending out or get the text messages he's sending out,
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  people that sign up for the alerts on the campaign site, it sounds like info wars.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  You listen to Rush Limbaugh, it sounds like info wars.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  It's not that Trump or Limbaugh are plagiarizing what I'm saying. Historically, this is what's really happening.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  And now it's all out in the open. It's not debated.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  So yes, it's great that Trump's raising $15, $20 million a week. That's wonderful.
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  But what we need is courage and what we need is action in Congress.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  And what we need is to go out to all the Democrat events and legally and lawfully but loudly and sternly
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  bring up real issues of their criminal activity and their treason.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  And let the left know they haven't intimidated us off of cyberspace or off of the third dimension, the streets of this nation.
[27:33.000 --> 27:42.000]  That is so critical. And it's critical to understand that info wars doesn't have big donors or big Republican fat cats or George Soros.
[27:42.000 --> 27:49.000]  We're supported by you buying products at infowarstore.com that are amazing and everybody needs air filtration and water filtration.

[28:42.000 --> 28:49.000]  We need more support now than ever. It's so critical, just like the country is in crisis. InfoWars mirrors that just exactly.
[28:49.000 --> 29:15.000]  Our ideology is winning. It's popular, but because of that, we're under attack. We're fighting for you. But I need you to step up.
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  I wonder how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:31.000 --> 29:39.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:39.000 --> 29:47.000]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305. That's 866-295-5305.

[29:58.000 --> 30:06.000]  We're not funded by George Soros here at InfoWars. We're not funded by Hollywood or the Left or Republican Party or the Mercers or the Koch Brother.
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  I know body, but you the listeners. Ladies and gentlemen, history is happening.
[30:09.000 --> 30:15.000]  The globalists are trying to start a hot civil war. They're going to try to remove Trump with impeachment, with assassination. You name it.
[30:15.000 --> 30:22.000]  And InfoWars has been under unmitigated attack because we helped get Trump into office. You helped get Trump into office.
[30:22.000 --> 30:26.000]  And they won a silenced before the 2020 election that's already starting.
[30:26.000 --> 30:31.000]  So your prayers and your financial support and your word of mouth is beyond paramount. It's critical.
[30:31.000 --> 30:36.000]  We make it easy to support us right now. With the biggest sales we've had since Christmas, Black Friday comes two months early.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  There's only four or five days left in this sale. A lot of stuff is about to sell out.
[30:40.000 --> 30:47.000]  Store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points for your next order, and 50% off all the supplements and all preparedness goods and more.
[30:47.000 --> 30:54.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139. Again, ladies and gentlemen, Black Friday comes early.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  Store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, 50% off. Please take action.
[30:58.000 --> 31:09.000]  History is happening right now. President Trump is trying to remove the swamp, the globalists that have been feeding on our nation and selling us out of the chai comms and others.
[31:09.000 --> 31:16.000]  That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the Attorney General Barr has to resign because he's corrupt.
[31:16.000 --> 31:25.000]  That's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state, that there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[31:25.000 --> 31:33.000]  Already two weeks ago, the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected. The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[31:33.000 --> 31:38.000]  That means the indictment is there. That's why they're so panicked. That's why this impeachment's real.
[31:38.000 --> 31:45.000]  Of course it's made up. Of course it's a fraud, but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've committed so many crimes.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  They're back as against the wall and they're making their move right now.
[31:49.000 --> 31:58.000]  This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen. We're fighting for not just our nation, but the world's future. America is fighting for its life.
[32:19.000 --> 32:30.000]  To ban that video is evil Americans whose Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up like China do.
[32:30.000 --> 32:39.000]  Hey, I told you don't go to ban that video. I'm watching you. Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[32:39.000 --> 32:45.000]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[32:45.000 --> 32:55.000]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you. Do what CNN says and do not visit ban that video or I have to hurt you.
[33:16.000 --> 33:22.000]  The head of Twitter talked about the beautiful threads of the Satanic verses.
[33:22.000 --> 33:25.000]  He's talking about Salman Rushdie's book, but it is.
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  It is passages reportedly inspired by Satan.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  This is part of the course. These people are looking for dark power.
[33:45.000 --> 34:02.000]  Here's a special report I filed yesterday. Then I'm going to get the latest breaking news next segment and then give the number out to take your calls about what do we do about this push for civil war to overthrow the 2016 election and then cause a race and culture war so vicious and violent that the globalists finally conquer this country.
[34:02.000 --> 34:22.000]  This is the most important point in our history since July 4, 1776.
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  Infowars the most banned network in the world.
[34:27.000 --> 34:35.000]  There is a saying, no one knows who first claimed it, spent around for thousands of years, but it goes like this.
[34:35.000 --> 34:42.000]  The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world that he doesn't exist.
[34:42.000 --> 34:53.000]  And if you go to public school or even most private schools or if you go to major university, you're taught there is no God, there is no devil, we're just machines.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  In fact, we don't even have free will.
[34:58.000 --> 35:07.000]  But then I began to notice when I was going to college that a lot of the professors teaching that when I went and looked them up, were actually into the occult.
[35:07.000 --> 35:15.000]  There's a lot of examples of this, but there was a professor at the University of Texas who was the head of the biology department, Dr. Eric Pianka.
[35:15.000 --> 35:31.000]  And he said on his own website that he was a druid practitioner and believed in the occult and was even on the UT website, him dressed up as an occultist that's in my film, In Game, blueprint for global enslavement, and that made 12 years ago.
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.000]  He wants global depopulation, he thinks humans are inherently just bad and he believes in the spirit world.
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.000]  But if you go back to what he was teaching class, we're just machines, there is no God, there is no devil.
[35:42.000 --> 35:53.000]  The truth is, examples of the establishment and the left's obsession with the occult and straight up devil worship is historically all over the place and happening now, every day.
[35:53.000 --> 36:10.000]  In fact, just this weekend in Portland, Antifa had a city sponsored event that the mayor supports where they came out and did black magic rituals against the Patriot prayer march that's happened there the last few years, trying to exercise it and keep it from even taking place in the city.
[36:10.000 --> 36:25.000]  If you agree with me, if you agree, repeat after me. Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan!
[36:25.000 --> 36:46.000]  The French Revolution itself was occultic, Luciferian, satanic, it was the left hand path, which means the sinister side following the devil. It didn't just want to overthrow the church and the royalty, it wanted to overthrow the family itself and it wanted to target children.
[36:46.000 --> 37:01.000]  If you go back thousands of years ago, all across the Middle East, all across Africa, all across what's western Europe today or Mesoamerica, human sacrifice of women and children, virgins demanded by these dark wicked gods.
[37:01.000 --> 37:15.000]  Bob Dylan, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, almost every quote pop or rock star that you see making the top of the charts will tell you they made a deal with the literal devil in this world for success.
[37:15.000 --> 37:25.000]  Well, it goes back to the destiny theme and I made it to bargain with it, you know, a long time ago and I'm holding up my hand.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  What was your bargain?
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  To get where I am now.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  Should I ask who you made the bargain with?
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  With the chief commander.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  On this earth?
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  On this earth and in the world we can't see.
[37:44.000 --> 38:03.000]  Bob Dylan told 60 Minutes and other national TV programs that he was given magical enlightenment by the devil himself to be able to come up with the rhymes, the music that he developed and all of it when he went to the crossroads in the south where his idol admitted that he himself had sold his soul to the devil.
[38:03.000 --> 38:18.000]  That's when I went to the crossroads and made a big deal, you know, like one night and then went back to Minneapolis and I was like, hey, where's this guy been?
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  You know, he went to the crossroads.
[38:21.000 --> 38:33.000]  I even tried to scratch the surface in this report of not just top musicians but top entertainers, movie stars, scientists, world leaders saying that they owe their success to the devil.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  This would be a 10 hour report.
[38:35.000 --> 38:49.000]  Just this week Eddie Murphy came out in an interview with Jerry Seinfeld on the program Comedians and Cars and Coffee and talked about Sammy Davis Jr. who was serious as the devil saying he owed his allegiance to Satan.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Sammy told me he worshiped the devil.
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.000]  We were in Dan Tana's on that restaurant with all the pictures that Sammy was like.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  You know, Satan is as powerful as God.
[38:59.000 --> 39:21.000]  May West, Charlie Manson and countless others believe they were following the directives of Satan.
[39:21.000 --> 39:30.000]  But they are mimicking from ancient German satanic death cults going back directly to Adam Weisop, the founder of the Illuminati.
[39:30.000 --> 39:39.000]  Skull and Bones in New Haven, Connecticut initiates the sons and daughters of powerful elites into what can only be called a satanic religion.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  Now to the heart of the matter.
[39:41.000 --> 39:52.000]  I personally have been offered by these power networks to join them if I will join with Lucifer and be given incredible power in the world government system.
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  I've been offered this for more than 25 years and I've always said no.
[39:57.000 --> 40:03.000]  Mark Dice was offered a national TV program with some household names.
[40:03.000 --> 40:08.000]  But first they asked him to pledge himself to Lucifer.
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.000]  So I take you back full circle. The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  The entire power structure of the world is satanic.
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  They now admit they're keeping babies alive and harvesting their organs.
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  Human animal clones have been created for more than 30 years and they're just now admitting it to the public.
[40:27.000 --> 40:42.000]  This world government system is targeting Christians by design and creating a world cashless society or world social score or conservatives, nationalists, Christians and others who won't allow their children to be indoctrinated into the world government system
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  will be targeted and their right to buy and sell taken away.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  Prophecy is being manifest.
[40:49.000 --> 40:57.000]  In summation, there is a God that created the universe that wants us to use our free will to choose to join him.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  But we have been given free will. We are the seat of the universe.
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.000]  As Gandhi said, incredible potential. We're made the image of God. So we can choose to go with the devil.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  It's true. God created the devil and has allowed the devil to be our tester.
[41:09.000 --> 41:16.000]  This is real. This entire life is only a flash. It's boot camp. It's a test.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  Faust. Many historians now believe it did exist.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  But regardless, the legend of Faust gives us the keys to understand what's happening.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  Faust could have gotten out of his deal with the devil any time he wanted.
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.000]  The devil didn't give Faust all those skills. God gave Faust and all of us gifts.
[41:35.000 --> 41:45.000]  The devil is older than us and is able to show us some of the gifts and convince us that he gave us the gifts so we believe we are trapped under his control.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  It's a giant fraud. These people that serve Satan have been deceived.
[41:50.000 --> 41:56.000]  And that's why they later learn it isn't about money and power. It isn't about being cool or being a great poet or an artist.
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  Once the devil tricks you to become his slave, then you must carry out evil against the innocence.
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  Or the devil will use his worldly power against you to bring you down.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  That's why Christ said, when I am in you, the world will hate you and will come after you.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a test. This is real.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  And those of you that have served Satan can leave the devil any time you want.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  But you've got to allow God's spirit to come into you. And God doesn't do that unless you ask God in.
[42:25.000 --> 42:31.000]  Humble yourself before God. Go to the quiet place the most high and ask for the Holy Spirit to enter your body.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  The only thing you should fear is, one of our presidents said, is fear itself.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  You should not fear he who can take your physical body away.
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  But he who can damn you to hell for eternity, don't make the wrong choice.
[42:45.000 --> 42:53.000]  Renounce Satan. Join Christ. The devil's real. The Christ is real. You're real. And your free will is real.
[42:53.000 --> 43:19.000]  Make the right decision and join God in eternity.
[43:24.000 --> 43:44.000]  The devil's real. The Christ is real.

[47:23.000 --> 47:46.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[47:46.000 --> 47:56.000]  There is a lot more at stake, ladies and gentlemen, than just the United States or just Christians.
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.000]  The entire future of the planet and our trajectory into the future is being decided.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  I'm a very empathic person.
[48:06.000 --> 48:19.000]  I look up on people's emotions, energy and I undoubtedly have the touch as everyone has, but I've got a particular touch too much.
[48:19.000 --> 48:26.000]  And I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the energy level on the planet right now is explosive.
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.000]  I've never felt anything like it.
[48:32.000 --> 48:39.000]  It's hard for me to even be on air and I can tell you the deep state is making their move on Trump.
[48:39.000 --> 48:47.000]  This is 100% real and if they're unable to remove him, they're going to try to assassinate the president.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  I guarantee you they're trying to poison his food.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  Trump feeds off this.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  He's very, very excited.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  He realizes he's living in a real action-adventure movie.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  I'm very similar.
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  I know a lot of you are similar.
[49:07.000 --> 49:15.000]  But we now have Democrats and Republicans saying it feels like a 1776 kind of fight.
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  We'll tell you about that more coming up.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  But that's what this is.
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  And so you notice every talking point, everything we say, it's as if it magically all became reality.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  It didn't become reality.
[49:28.000 --> 49:34.000]  It was already reality right below the surface.
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.000]  I just put on my mask and snorkel and dived down a little bit.
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  And let me tell you, the deeper you get, the worse it gets.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  And I want to point something out.
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.000]  The people trying to conquer our civilization from the top to the bottom are the scum of the earth.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  The most nasty, evil people you can imagine.
[49:53.000 --> 50:01.000]  When you watch Antifa across the United States attack women, children, old people in wheelchairs,
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  you think they have no chivalry.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  What's wrong with them?
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.000]  Why do they do things that to any normal person is the most outrageous thing you could do?
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  Because they're into killing babies.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  They're into killing them after they're born.
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  They're almost all on hardcore drugs and into the occult.
[50:18.000 --> 50:25.000]  They are the servants of Satan.
[50:25.000 --> 50:32.000]  We're going to show you a four-minute compilation of Antifa being mean to men, women, and children and old people.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  There's a new video by Paul Joseph Watson.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  He's got an article about it on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  It needs to go viral.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  People need to see this video.
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  Antifa protesters scream and block elderly women.
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.000]  They're simply going across the street and there's all these other people walking across,
[50:49.000 --> 50:56.000]  but the Antifa targets a woman that looks like she's at least 85 years old.
[50:56.000 --> 51:02.000]  If I had to do an analysis, it looks like it's either her son or younger brother taking care of her.
[51:02.000 --> 51:08.000]  You know, we've all seen the older son taking care of the elderly mother.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  But all the body language, everything is, that's his mother.
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.000]  And scum of the earth and mass come over and scream and yell at her.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  She's obviously pretty much deaf.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  Can't even hear what they're saying.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  She just keeps trying to move across the street.
[51:21.000 --> 51:27.000]  But like wolves that pick out a hurt lamb, they go for her.
[51:27.000 --> 51:33.000]  We've got footage of this where we'll be out and Antifa will go over to some old guy on a walker.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  We've got footage of this and start knocking him into traffic.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  You go, why would you target the weak?
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  See, if I was going to fight somebody who was the enemy, I'd take out their strongest person first.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  That's my instinct.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  I'd go for the biggest meanest guy.
[51:44.000 --> 51:47.000]  I'd go for whoever was supposedly in charge.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  That's instinctive.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  Well, for them, they go after the weakest.
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.000]  It's what they do.
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  The children, the old.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  And look at these articles.
[51:57.000 --> 52:03.000]  Netflix movie depicts futuristic Antifa that time travels back to kill Trump supporters in the year 2000
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  to stop world government from being defeated.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  You actually have to read this. The show's out. It's unbelievable.
[52:09.000 --> 52:17.000]  ADL says Antifa are wonderful people and anyone criticizing them is basically a Nazi.
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  And that any Antifa anti-images are hate symbols.
[52:20.000 --> 52:26.000]  How sick of the Anti-Defamation League.
[52:26.000 --> 52:33.000]  The truth is Antifa is an anti-American, globalist, Maoist organization that, again, is the scum of the earth
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  and is an anti-free speech.
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  Let's go ahead and roll a four minute compilation of this for radio listeners all narrate.
[52:40.000 --> 52:50.000]  Here is the old woman just yesterday in Canada as she tries to walk across the street. Here it is.
[52:50.000 --> 52:59.000]  Nazi's gone off our streets. Nazi's gone off our streets. Nazi's gone off our streets. Nazi's gone off our streets.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  Now hit pause and back this back up. We're going to play it again from the start. The whole compilation.
[53:04.000 --> 53:10.000]  They just pick old white people and think you must be Nazi scum. They're not wearing any identifying stuff.
[53:10.000 --> 53:18.000]  She's wearing baby blue. She's on a walker. These people are so cowardly. Ooh, I can scare an old woman.
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.000]  They leave big men, women, people walking across the busy city street alone.
[53:23.000 --> 53:29.000]  They swarm a woman on a walker.
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.000]  And look, I'm not being Mr. Tough Guy, but I mean, you got to hand it to this guy for not decking him.
[53:34.000 --> 53:41.000]  But that's what they're paid to do is to start a riot. Let's go back to the scum of the earth, who the media says are heroes. Here they are.
[53:41.000 --> 53:56.000]  Nazi's gone off our streets. Nazi's gone off our streets. Nazi's gone off our streets. Nazi's gone off our streets. Nazi's gone off our streets.
[53:56.000 --> 54:03.000]  Blocking her walker, jumping up against him.
[54:03.000 --> 54:17.400]  I think we should classify them as a gang.
[54:17.400 --> 54:23.240]  You know, they come dressed in uniforms, they have weapons, they're almost a militia.
[54:23.240 --> 54:26.760]  I think we need to think about that in terms of our law enforcement approach.
[54:26.760 --> 54:34.360]  We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, this egregious display of hatred, bigotry,
[54:34.360 --> 54:36.480]  and violence on many sides.
[54:36.480 --> 54:37.480]  On many sides.
[54:37.480 --> 54:38.480]  Wait.
[54:38.480 --> 54:39.480]  On many sides?
[54:39.480 --> 54:43.160]  This was a white nationalist rally.
[54:43.160 --> 54:45.280]  You have to call that out by name.
[54:45.280 --> 54:46.280]  Many sides?
[54:46.280 --> 54:54.040]  Mr. President, this is terrorism, not your order at KFC.
[54:54.040 --> 54:59.240]  Prior to the unrest, police banned sticks, masks, any other potential weapons, so ever
[54:59.240 --> 55:02.480]  dozens of anti-fascist protesters broke those rules and appears.
[55:02.480 --> 55:06.680]  They also pepper sprayed the leader of the conservative group, one left-wing demonstrator
[55:06.680 --> 55:10.560]  attacked a photographer, and others reportedly threatened people who were trying to film
[55:10.560 --> 55:11.560]  the violence.
[55:11.560 --> 55:16.160]  What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
[55:16.160 --> 55:19.320]  Do they have any semblance of guilt?
[55:19.320 --> 55:22.120]  Let me ask you this.
[55:22.120 --> 55:25.760]  What about the fact that came charging, that they came charging with clubs in their hand
[55:25.760 --> 55:27.160]  swinging clubs?
[55:27.160 --> 55:29.160]  Do they have any problem?
[55:29.160 --> 55:30.160]  I think they do.
[55:30.160 --> 55:37.400]  And they are just beating people, ganging up, men and women, ganging up on lone individuals,
[55:37.400 --> 55:43.400]  and just beating them in a wanton, savage, brown shirt, Nazi operation.
[55:43.400 --> 55:49.480]  They don't want to mention ANTIFA and how ANTIFA literally came trained, militarized,
[55:49.480 --> 55:51.800]  doing war-like maneuvers.
[55:51.800 --> 55:55.520]  You know, they bring coolers and you think, oh, it's just dehydrated.
[55:55.520 --> 56:00.280]  No, it's filled with water balloons, filled with feces, urine, just discussing things
[56:00.280 --> 56:02.200]  that will pop and explode on people.
[56:02.200 --> 56:04.520]  And water bottles filled with the same substances.
[56:04.520 --> 56:20.200]  Yeah, he just got struck with pepper spray, by some impassable liberal helping him.
[56:20.200 --> 56:21.200]  We're not all like this.
[56:21.200 --> 56:24.720]  No, you see, look, I attacked him, he's not a liberal, he's a Marxist.
[56:24.720 --> 56:28.560]  Every time one of these situations happens, you know, you see the worst of people, sometimes
[56:28.560 --> 56:30.400]  I think we saw it out of the left.
[56:30.400 --> 56:35.560]  You just saw those videos of them chasing and beating people, people in black clothing,
[56:35.560 --> 56:39.640]  black masks, over a hundred of them broke through the lines and attacked stragglers
[56:39.640 --> 56:40.640]  who were there.
[56:40.640 --> 56:42.280]  For the most part, the event was shut down.
[56:42.280 --> 56:47.520]  Now what the media has done, and we take the bait every time, is focused on Charlottesville,
[56:47.520 --> 56:50.960]  where they also funded the white supremacists the left did to create the clash.
[56:50.960 --> 56:54.320]  We're going to put a report out at the end of the show today, where I'm going to show
[56:54.320 --> 56:59.960]  you what happened in San Francisco when they just attacked families at the park and all
[56:59.960 --> 57:04.480]  the other attacks around the country that they don't want you to see, you see, but that's
[57:04.480 --> 57:07.040]  why I decided to show you that Charlottesville is coming up.
[57:07.040 --> 57:10.200]  We're going to show you what they're really doing all over the country and how they're
[57:10.200 --> 57:11.760]  carrying it out.
[57:11.760 --> 57:12.840]  Please stay with us.
[57:12.840 --> 57:13.840]  We're going to give the number out.
[57:13.840 --> 57:15.200]  We're going to take your calls.
[57:15.200 --> 57:16.400]  We're already in a civil war.
[57:16.400 --> 57:17.840]  They want a violent civil war.
[57:17.840 --> 57:21.960]  They intend to impeach the president that they're openly saying they want a killing.
[57:21.960 --> 57:22.960]  That's Democrats.
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.560]  That's CFR members.
[57:24.560 --> 57:26.960]  That's the governor of Massachusetts.
[57:26.960 --> 57:28.200]  That's who these people are.
[57:28.200 --> 57:30.160]  What are we going to do about it?
[57:30.160 --> 57:31.160]  Because it's here.
[57:31.160 --> 57:34.400]  They're making their move because Trump's really trying to clean up the swamp.
[57:34.400 --> 57:38.360]  He's really going after the corruption, and they don't know what to do.
[57:38.360 --> 57:39.360]  Trump's betting on America.
[57:39.360 --> 57:40.360]  I'm betting on America.
[57:40.360 --> 57:41.360]  Are you betting on America?
[57:41.360 --> 57:43.480]  We don't have a choice now.
[57:43.480 --> 57:44.480]  They're going for broke.
[57:44.480 --> 57:45.480]  We'll be right back.
[57:45.480 --> 57:53.600]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[57:53.600 --> 57:56.400]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[57:56.400 --> 58:01.080]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[58:01.080 --> 58:05.840]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[58:05.840 --> 58:08.440]  for their organs to be harvested.
[58:08.440 --> 58:13.560]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson at infowars.com, 15 years ago that
[58:13.560 --> 58:18.840]  Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do at hundreds
[58:18.840 --> 58:24.280]  and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for
[58:24.280 --> 58:28.520]  profit, trying to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood had been taken
[58:28.520 --> 58:33.240]  over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[58:33.240 --> 58:37.240]  We've been dead on, and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale.
[58:37.240 --> 58:41.960]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down, and that's why you are more critical
[58:41.960 --> 58:44.040]  than ever to support the Info War.
[58:44.040 --> 58:48.480]  Please support the Info War however you can.
[58:48.480 --> 58:52.960]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong, trying to fact check the President?
[58:52.960 --> 58:59.560]  The deceptive, humpty-dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion,
[58:59.560 --> 59:05.080]  Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air in a censor us.
[59:05.080 --> 59:09.240]  And of course, he famously settled on many others that Trump is the Info War's President.
[59:09.240 --> 59:14.040]  Even Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[59:14.040 --> 59:16.680]  say, the Info War's President.
[59:16.680 --> 59:18.120]  And you know what is true?
[59:18.120 --> 59:23.200]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought
[59:23.200 --> 59:26.920]  Trump from the White House and other nationalists to power around the world, and now Trump's
[59:26.920 --> 59:31.640]  openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human
[59:31.640 --> 59:32.640]  tyrannies.
[59:32.640 --> 59:37.160]  So this is a day of great victory, and I salute you all, but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[59:37.160 --> 59:42.200]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now, so we can continue on to
[59:42.200 --> 59:46.600]  the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end until we've
[59:46.600 --> 59:52.000]  defeated them.
[59:52.000 --> 1:00:07.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:12.840]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:14.840]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:24.520]  Well, I'm trying to not just explode in spontaneous combustion here because the energy level,
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:29.600]  the good and evil that's rising right now on this planet is just palpable.
[1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:33.360]  We're going to go over all the attempts to impeach the president, the game plan, and
[1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:34.360]  then I'm going to open the phones up.
[1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:35.760]  How do you think we stop this?
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:40.920]  What do we do to not just be spectators, but to take action and stay note of this whole
[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:41.920]  operation?
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:46.920]  It's all coming up, a toll-free number to join us, first-time callers in the first round,
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:47.920]  877-789-2539.
[1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:51.960]  If you called in, never got on, we'd love to hear from you.
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:01:00.760]  That counts as first-time caller as well, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, but first off, let's play this
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:03.040]  important special report.
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:06.720]  We could not ignore what the president did.
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:10.600]  He gave us no choice, so it wasn't any change of mind.
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:14.880]  I always said, we will follow the facts where they take us.
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:19.120]  They just prepared this lie, that's why Pelosi went ahead with the impeachment press conference
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:22.080]  before she ever read the transcript.
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:26.160]  The two are night and day different, the president did absolutely nothing wrong.
[1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:30.920]  We can never let this happen, we're fighting to drain the swamp, and that's exactly what
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:36.840]  I'm doing, and you see why we have to do it, because our country is at stake, like never
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:37.840]  before.
[1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:42.720]  We've got Obama on the stage with the Russian Prime Minister, Medidyev, saying, oh, after
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:44.400]  the election, I can do a lot more.
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:49.240]  My life's at stake, please, and after my election, I am more flexible.
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:54.600]  I trust this foundation to live in and understand what's going on.
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:57.360]  Well, guess what, that's not impeachable offense.
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:03.120]  The president is the executive branch, he's allowed to make deals with foreign powers,
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:08.080]  as long as they're not selling the country out, but the Chinese communists have bought
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.200]  this nation off, and the Russians bought off Hillary to a great extent, but the Iranian
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:18.080]  one and so many other issues, I mean, Trump is the stalwart for this nation.
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:22.800]  And then Paul Krugman comes out for the third time and says, who will all be in FEMA camps?
[1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:24.760]  Trump's going to put journalists in camps.
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:28.680]  It's Obama went after the whistleblowers, and Obama went after the press.
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:32.000]  Agents monitored Rosen's movements in and out of the State Department.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:36.480]  They searched his personal emails and combed through his cell phone records.
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:42.080]  The subpoena says James Rosen is a potential criminal because he's a reporter.
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:47.640]  Is the White House comfortable with that standard never before seen in a leak investigation?
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:53.200]  The investigation into Rosen has sparked a rare thing in Washington, bipartisan outrage
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:57.000]  over what some are calling Obama's war on journalism.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  It's conservatives being kicked off the air and being sued and lied about and arrested
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.480]  and persecuted.
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:07.240]  And the Democratic Party and the corporate media and the Hollywood scum, bought and paid
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:12.320]  for by the chai comms who literally own the majority of six of the eight big Hollywood
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:18.240]  production firms, now know that no one believes them other than their own cult followers, maybe
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:27.240]  20% of the public who knows it's all a lie, but goes with it because they still think
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:32.780]  they can fool somebody or they can at least disrupt the country and cause a stock market
[1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:34.280]  crash.
[1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:38.560]  Remember last year, Bill Maher came out and said, I want to crash the economy so that
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:39.560]  Trump doesn't win.
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:43.560]  He said it again this year, and then the private fellow reserve raised interest rates a bunch
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:44.560]  to do that.
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:49.880]  I mean, we're watching groups openly try to sabotage the country at the behest of foreign
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:52.000]  powers.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:56.600]  While telling us continually the president's a traitor and he's selling us out to the Russians
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:01.480]  and the Ukrainians and everybody else when he's the America first president, everybody
[1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:02.480]  knows it.
[1:04:02.480 --> 1:04:12.040]  Paul Krugman won a Nobel Prize for economics for supporting and pushing Obama era type
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:18.000]  economic propaganda, which is the industrialization of the West screwing America over garbage.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:23.040]  And then Krugman famously, of course, said that Trump would never get the growth rate
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:27.440]  up to 3%, and remember Obama said Trump doesn't have a magic wand, you can't do it, Obama
[1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:30.960]  could never do it, Trump got it up to 3.8.
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:34.320]  They're making their move on America right now, and they've got your kids at the public
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:38.280]  schools, they've got your money where you sent your young people to these colleges,
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:42.820]  almost all the degrees are worthless, by design, and then they promise them, oh, once the utopia
[1:04:42.820 --> 1:04:46.000]  takes over of communism, then you're going to have a place in it.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.720]  And so that's why the millennials, more than half of them are working for a communist utopia,
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.800]  is because they've been told that they're the ruling class by con artists like Paul
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:55.800]  Krugman.
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:04:56.800]  This is it.
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:02.320]  History is happening right now, every action is changed, exposing the globalist, exposing
[1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:06.880]  their crimes, every phone call, every letter you write to Congress, every time you march,
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:11.680]  every time you spread the word about infowars.com, reports last show, and band.video, you are
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:14.120]  literally exposing the globalist.
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:18.040]  They can only win this thing if they can black out all news and information, and they've
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:20.000]  been failing, and now they're getting scared.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.400]  But without money, infowars can't operate.
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:26.160]  Now we sell great water filtration, great air filtration, high quality swirable foods

[1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:06.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:19.800]  the info war.
[1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:25.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, September 20th, 2019, we're already into hour number
[1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:30.880]  two, and I intend starting at the bottom of the hour for the rest of the broadcast to
[1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:34.440]  take your phone calls on one big issue.
[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:39.040]  This country's already in a cold civil war, as I've been saying for three years.
[1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:43.600]  Now the president says we're going out of a cold civil war into a hot civil war, and
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:48.240]  the Democrats are pushing that, and they're openly funded by the Communist Chinese.
[1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:52.840]  Even the Secretary General of the UN last week said, there is a world war going on between
[1:06:52.840 --> 1:06:58.160]  China and America, it's economic, it's cultural, and it's becoming military.
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:04.440]  Now I've been saying that really for 20 years, I've been on air 25 years, and I used to get
[1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:08.240]  Bill Gertz on from the Washington Times about China, the big threat in the future, and how
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:12.600]  the Clintons sold us out with the missile secrets, so we've been on it for most of the
[1:07:12.600 --> 1:07:15.480]  time I've been on air.
[1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:19.840]  But now it's the elephant sitting on us, not the elephant in the room, and that's what
[1:07:19.840 --> 1:07:25.640]  the Democrats can basically go to to fund whatever they want, and the Democrats can
[1:07:25.640 --> 1:07:31.520]  get investments in China that the Communist Party backs and absolutely pay them off.
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:36.520]  And Ukraine's been paying off Democrats and Republicans, and so has Russia has been using
[1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:40.920]  the Democrats, and the Democrats have been using them like a cash machine.
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:45.400]  And so Trump comes in, and he did fire all the lobbyists, now he's had some of his staff
[1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:50.480]  secretly become lobbyists and run their own scams, that's been a big problem, just because
[1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:56.240]  Trump won't do it and makes his own decisions.
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:07:59.320]  It doesn't matter because the people under him are running all sorts of scams, so a lot
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:02.640]  of them are bought off, a lot of them are paid off, a lot of them take money, then they
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:07.720]  can be compromised, and they're told, you better go in and take out Trump, you better
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:10.720]  find some reason or we're going to burn you and put you in prison.
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:15.600]  And it's because Trump's never gotten full control of the Justice Department that they're
[1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:19.600]  making this move right now because they still got some of their people in there, but now
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:28.080]  Barr has convened the grand juries, both informational and to indict, and it's confirmed that McCabe
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:32.880]  has been indicted for several months, and they brought the appeal to the Deputy Attorney
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:38.320]  General, that's how it works, to be able to kill that prosecution, and they said, no,
[1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:44.360]  that means the prosecution is like a barracuda just right out of vision in the water about
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:50.720]  to swoop in and eat the little fishy, that's McCabe, and McCabe has said, if I go down,
[1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:53.440]  everyone's going to go down with me, well the last person to say that was Commerce
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:59.760]  Secretary Ron Brown, and the Air Force Colonel that did his autopsy said he'd been shot through
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:06.600]  the head by a 45 through the head, they had troops on board, killed everybody on board,
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:13.120]  blew the hatch, he load, high load out, crashed the plane in the mountain, one woman lived,
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:17.120]  she was really not even hurt, she didn't make it back to by the time the ambulance
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:23.200]  got to the base, they killed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown when he shot his mouth off and said,
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:29.560]  I go down, everybody goes down, and it was the same corruption using commerce and US
[1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:33.360]  government deals to line their pockets with billions of dollars, Hal Bill Clinton would
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:39.400]  have Chinese generals at the White House, it was on C-Span, they ended up releasing
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:44.800]  the footage in plain clothes with big square briefcases, somebody's got that footage
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:50.960]  sent us to us, I aired it years ago on Access TV like 22 years ago, and man I got death
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:55.040]  threats when I did that, it was incredible, I've never been able to find that footage
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:01.880]  since, but it was put on C-Span, it came out as part of the impeachment hearings, and
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:05.440]  they were in there with big square briefcases full of $100 bills giving them to Bill Clinton,
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:10.080]  and he was all taking one, oh thanks a lot, I appreciate it, I'm going to get you those
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:15.760]  missile secrets now, and so this has been ongoing for a while, and now Trump's sitting
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:19.880]  there and just looks at the numbers, makes the best decisions of what's good for industry,
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:25.040]  what's good for families, what's good for our defense, what's good for our future,
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:33.480]  and they're going crazy, so the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539, how bad's
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:38.080]  it going to get, I mean gut level and also just looking at it, the Democrats don't have
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:42.160]  a case to get Trump, they don't care, they have the votes in the House to impeach the
[1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:48.480]  President, will the Senate remove, Cabinon barely got approved folks, they're going to
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:52.960]  have women come out and say Trump rapes them, Cabinon was just a dry run of that, they're
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:56.760]  going to bring out all these lawyers that work for Trump, that are getting indicted
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:00.880]  for not paying their taxes or beating their wife or whatever, they're all being told you
[1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:05.560]  come out against Trump or you're going to go to jail, and they've got all these indictments
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:09.360]  in the Southern District ready, and all the indictments in Chicago ready, and all the
[1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:14.000]  indictments in D.C. and Maryland ready, and indictments in Florida ready, they've got
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:20.480]  all these kept prosecutors, and it's all just going to come out during the six committees
[1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:27.480]  by Thanksgiving, watch, you see Pelosi, she's all freaked out, she's shaking, the Democrats
[1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:30.800]  are all whacked out, because they're making their criminal move right now, and their hands
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:35.560]  are shaking while they do it, because behind them the chai comms, the globalists, the multinationals,
[1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:39.480]  they're saying do whatever it takes, even if it's a civil war, we'll protect you, but
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:43.000]  deep down the left knows they're not going to be protected.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:50.160]  This is going to be explosive, and hitting theaters this weekend, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:55.720]  the Joker about a guy living in his mom's basement, who's the leftist washed up comedian
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:59.640]  who goes out and commits mass shootings and bombings and all the rest of it, and I told
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:04.640]  you it's tailor funded to trigger mass shootings, and two weeks after I did a big report on
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:11.400]  it, the Pentagon came out and said we've got intel that there are groups planning organized
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:15.800]  mass shootings dressed as jokers.
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:21.320]  Antifa folks knows how to false flag, and they've got mentally ill methods ready to do
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:26.280]  it, and they're loading their social media with Trump and Alex Jones support right now,
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:29.720]  and they're going to march into those movie theaters, and they're going to gun people
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:37.800]  down, and they're going to blame you, the gun owner, it's coming, it's coming, it's
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:42.360]  coming, I wouldn't get anywhere near those Joker's greetings, if you want to get shot
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:47.720]  up, go to them, and one of the directors said this is a reflection of culture, I don't apologize
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:54.320]  for whatever it does, because they know damn well what they're doing, just like all the
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:59.440]  news shows about hunting and killing Trump supporters, Netflix movie depicts time traveling
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:03.600]  liberals carrying out pre-crime murder of patriots to prevent American uprising against
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:13.160]  globalism, Hollywood continues peddling fantasies of killing Trump supporters and conservatives.
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:16.240]  They know exactly what they're doing, they know in all the studies that when you hype
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:22.360]  mass shootings, it causes mentally ill people to go out and commit mass shootings, and they
[1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:28.240]  know these are all trench coat wearing white male incel devil worshipers that can't get
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:34.000]  a girl, Texas the last three times, trench coat devil worshipers can't get a girl, Ohio
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.840]  trench coat devil worshipers can't get a girl, Florida, Parkland, trench coat devil
[1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:43.880]  worshipers can't get a girl, Sandy Hook, trench coat devil worshipers can't get a girl, Harrison
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:51.920]  Clybold, the original beta test, trench coat incel devil worshipers can't get a girl, and
[1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:56.400]  then the media hypes it and hypes it until it becomes an option.
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:00.640]  Don't commit suicide, don't have suicide by cop, don't jump off a bridge, go kill people
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:06.120]  at a school, they're disarmed, and the demon in them directs them to do it, and then disarm
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:11.320]  the American people so the red terror can have its way with us in a full long protracted
[1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:17.720]  civil war where America finally has its will broken, not going to happen, because we've
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:20.640]  got the jump on you.
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:24.120]  We've got the jump on you, ladies and gentlemen.

[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:33.800]  A little piece put together, I guess, in the line of a Miller Lied ad from the 1990s about
[1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:34.800]  cuck life.
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:38.640]  Here it is.

[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:09.560]  I'm surprised this commercial is still running.

[1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:06.320]  We've come a long way together.
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:08.240]  That's why they're trying to shut us all down.
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:09.640]  Now here's just a short clip of this.
[1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:16.600]  I ended up watching a 21-minute clip on Info Wars Friday of Greta Thunberg.
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:22.600]  There were four or five questions to her where she just said, I can't answer your question.
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:25.680]  Here's just one of those.
[1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:28.160]  And again, if you're a radio listener, you can't see her, but she keeps looking at her
[1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:32.880]  handler who admittedly, again, is being funded by George Soros.
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:37.720]  And it came out the whole climate strike thing worldwide was funded by of course George Soros,
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:40.200]  which is just the front man for the globalist deep state.
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:41.200]  So here it is.
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:47.360]  Please tell us what kind of message, what you are doing here today, what kind of message
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:54.320]  would you send by doing this to world leaders and also kind of ask you, do you think it's
[1:24:54.320 --> 1:25:07.200]  about time that President Trump would respond to what you have said today?
[1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:17.200]  I think, I'm sorry, what was the first question?
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:22.040]  What's the message you would like to send to a leader by doing what you are doing?
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:27.880]  I think what we want to send is, the message we want to send is to say that we have had
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:34.080]  enough and anyone else wants to answer that question?
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:37.360]  I can't speak on behalf of everyone.
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:45.880]  Anyone wants to answer about the message to world leaders?
[1:25:45.880 --> 1:25:46.880]  What about President Trump?
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:47.880]  He's here today.
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:51.600]  Do you think he should respond in a new way?
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:56.720]  I think maybe you should give some questions to the others as well.
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:01.200]  This went on for 21 minutes, what I saw reportedly went on for hours, but I sat through a clip
[1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:08.000]  that was 21 minutes long and people were groveling to her and she wouldn't answer any questions.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.600]  She doesn't run her Twitter, she doesn't run anything, it's totally fake.
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:15.480]  We all know that and it fell flat on its face, which again, these people don't get the fact
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:17.800]  that no one is listening to them.
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:22.600]  Now John Coleman was the founder of the Weather Channel and came on our show several times.
[1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:25.880]  In fact, he came on my show once, it was like a dead a month later.
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:30.800]  So he was very well spoken to the very end, very smart guy and was a meteorologist.
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:36.600]  Here he is a few years ago tearing little Brian Stelter a new boo-boo.
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:40.480]  A denier, that is a word meant to put me down.
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:45.640]  I'm a skeptic about climate change and I want to make it darn clear Mr. Kenny is not a scientist,
[1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:46.640]  I am.
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:49.160]  He's the CEO of the Weather Channel now.
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:52.080]  I was the founder of the Weather Channel, not the co-founder.
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:55.400]  And I'm glad you did because I am addicted to the Weather Channel, I watch a lot of cable
[1:26:55.400 --> 1:26:56.400]  news.
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:03.240]  In a minute, I'm not done and CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming that
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:05.960]  is that it is a consensus.
[1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:11.640]  Well there is no consensus in science, science isn't a vote, science is about facts.
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:17.200]  And if you get down to the hard cold facts, there's no question about it.
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:24.160]  Climate change is not happening, there is no significant man-made global warming now,
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:28.240]  there hasn't been any in the past and there's no reason to expect any in the future.
[1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:35.080]  There's a whole lot of baloney and yes it has become a big political point of the Democratic
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:39.880]  Party and part of their platform and I regret it's become political instead of scientific.
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:42.120]  But the science is on my side.
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:45.380]  I don't think we're going to have a conclusion about the topic right here.
[1:27:45.380 --> 1:27:47.560]  What I do wonder though is when you see- I know we're not because you wouldn't allow
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:53.400]  it to happen on CNN but I'm happy that I got on the air and I got a chance to talk to your
[1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:57.400]  viewers, hello everybody, there is no global warming.
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:00.440]  What I do wonder is when you see- Let's stop right there, I'm going to play more
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:06.720]  of this later but you know that he made the rounds a decade ago or so about a few years
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:08.520]  ago and they banned him.
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:11.760]  He was the guy that wouldn't have on anymore because he's just too good because we're saying
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:16.280]  there's a total consensus and then he's a scientist and there's not a consensus and
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:18.760]  then the majority of scientists say it's a total fraud.
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:24.080]  The only constant is climate change but a volcano is more than all humans on earth in
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:29.720]  a year and it's good to have more carbon in the atmosphere it turns out.
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:36.040]  But here's Trudeau, the leader of Canada as we go out with another four second clip, a
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:40.200]  new blackface video where he has a giant zucchini in his pants.
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:41.200]  Let's go out with this.
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:44.480]  I mean I've never been in blackface but that's who these people are.
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:49.480]  Go ahead and roll Trudeau please, let me go to break.
[1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:52.480]  I mean look at it folks.
[1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:55.960]  I mean people are insane.
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:00.960]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of blackriflerealestate.com.
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:04.920]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:06.360]  my family to freedom.
[1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:10.800]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool
[1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:14.320]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:18.160]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our black rifle real
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:19.800]  estate team is here to help.
[1:29:19.800 --> 1:29:46.920]  Go to blackriflerealestate.com, that's blackriflerealestate.com.
[1:29:46.920 --> 1:30:16.080]  And
[1:30:16.080 --> 1:30:18.540]  that basically mimics the top skin creams
[1:30:18.540 --> 1:30:20.840]  that are already out there at a lower price
[1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:24.120]  with their patented silver salt technology in it.
[1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:26.080]  It's got the hyaluronic acid,
[1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:27.520]  it's got the steric acid,
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:30.040]  it's got the grapefruit essential oil,
[1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:33.760]  it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[1:30:33.760 --> 1:30:36.720]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream
[1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:39.280]  in 3.4 ounce and in a smaller one.
[1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:41.440]  You're not gonna find a product that's good anywhere.
[1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:43.440]  You're certainly not gonna find it at this price
[1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:47.200]  and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:50.200]  Get your super silver skin cream today.
[1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:52.920]  We can only run this special for another week or so
[1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:54.960]  as I'm taping this September 10th.
[1:30:56.120 --> 1:30:58.320]  We're not funded by George Soros here at InfoWars.
[1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:00.160]  We're not funded by Hollywood or the Left
[1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:03.640]  or Republican Party or the Mercers or the Koch Brother.
[1:31:03.640 --> 1:31:05.320]  By nobody but you the listeners.
[1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, history's happening.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:09.360]  The Globals are trying to start a hot civil war.
[1:31:09.360 --> 1:31:10.780]  They're going to try to remove Trump
[1:31:10.780 --> 1:31:13.240]  with impeachment, with assassination, you name it.
[1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:16.120]  And InfoWars has been under unmitigated attack
[1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:18.440]  because we helped get Trump into office.
[1:31:18.440 --> 1:31:19.920]  You helped get Trump into office
[1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:22.720]  and they won a silenced before the 2020 election
[1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:24.160]  that's already starting.
[1:31:24.160 --> 1:31:25.960]  So your prayers and your financial support
[1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:27.840]  and your word of mouth is beyond paramount.
[1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:28.680]  It's critical.
[1:31:28.680 --> 1:31:30.360]  You make it easy to support us right now.
[1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:32.400]  With the biggest sales we've had since Christmas,
[1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:34.200]  Black Friday comes two months early.
[1:31:34.200 --> 1:31:36.760]  There's only four or five days left in this sale.
[1:31:36.760 --> 1:31:38.360]  A lot of stuff is about to sell out.
[1:31:38.360 --> 1:31:39.560]  Store-wide free shipping,
[1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:41.080]  double-patriot points in your next order
[1:31:41.080 --> 1:31:43.040]  and 50% off all the supplements
[1:31:43.040 --> 1:31:44.800]  and all preparedness goods and more.

[1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:52.360]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Black Friday comes early.
[1:31:52.360 --> 1:31:54.200]  Store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points,
[1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:55.720]  50% off, please take action.
[1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:58.800]  Where I stand, the world has heard from presidents,
[1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:02.400]  premiers, rebels and heroes who emboldened us.
[1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:07.400]  Tuesday, the 24th of September, 2019 is a historical day.
[1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:09.600]  President Trump threw down the gauntlet
[1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:12.720]  and said globalism is not the future of the planet.
[1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:15.960]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[1:32:15.960 --> 1:32:17.400]  And then Trump went after them
[1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:20.200]  on how the Chai comms are stealing intellectual property.
[1:32:20.200 --> 1:32:22.520]  Dependent on massive market barriers,
[1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:25.400]  heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation,
[1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:27.320]  forced technology transfers
[1:32:27.320 --> 1:32:29.600]  and the theft of intellectual property.
[1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:30.920]  It was simply amazing.
[1:32:30.920 --> 1:32:33.400]  And then he talked about the ruling leftist elite
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:36.240]  and their censorship and how it must be met head-on.
[1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:40.120]  My administration has made clear to social media companies
[1:32:40.120 --> 1:32:43.160]  that we will uphold the right of free speech.
[1:32:43.160 --> 1:32:44.960]  This is amazing.
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:48.200]  Find highlights and Trump's entire historic speech
[1:32:48.200 --> 1:32:51.360]  at infowars.com and band.video.
[1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:52.640]  Band.video!
[1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:54.160]  And God bless America.
[1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:55.160]  Thank you very much.
[1:32:55.160 --> 1:33:06.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:06.680 --> 1:33:21.680]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:33.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:33.200 --> 1:33:58.960]  I only talk about the thought processes I'm going through
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:05.040]  on air because I'm empathetic and I see how I feel about things
[1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:07.200]  as the way you feel about them.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:09.400]  And I think I pretty much am dead on.
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:13.000]  The audience of this show are activists that want to be free,
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.400]  that recognize evil for what it is and that are trying to oppose it
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:19.200]  just from an instinctive and spiritual level.
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:22.520]  You can't help it but say no to this.
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:26.640]  And then it's very frustrating to see other people think it's a joke
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:27.640]  or think it's funny.
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:32.160]  I mean, I played football and I used to like to go over to my
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.920]  friend's houses from the time I was in elementary school to the
[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:39.600]  time I was probably about 25 years old and I'd watch the
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:43.240]  Super Bowl or I'd watch Playoffs or I'd watch the World Series
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:44.240]  in baseball.
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:45.640]  I like baseball.
[1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:46.640]  I like the Olympics.
[1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:49.120]  It's great.
[1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:53.080]  But I see people get obsessed and angry and depressed if their
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:59.680]  team loses or be super happy for a week when their team wins when
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:02.560]  it doesn't matter.
[1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:05.800]  We have children being kept alive and their organs harvested.
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:08.880]  We have the chai comms taking Christians and Buddhists and taking
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:11.280]  their organs by the millions.
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:12.600]  That's actually in the news today.
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:16.680]  I think whitewash but they admit it's going on.
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:20.400]  And if we aren't empathetic for those people, it's going to happen
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:24.760]  to us if we don't care what comes around, goes around, you reap
[1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:28.800]  what you sow, that's the law of the universe.
[1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:36.280]  And so I was down in the break room getting a little cup of coffee
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:39.600]  during the break and I just was standing there waiting for the
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:45.800]  coffee to finish making because somebody started a new pot.
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:55.280]  And I psychoanalyzed myself that I was just very angry.
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:59.280]  And I just had to say to myself, listen, you're doing the best job
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:00.280]  you can.
[1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:04.800]  But then I really sat back and said, no, you're not.
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.120]  We need to have people take action.
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:12.080]  And we need to develop a plan of how to take action.
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:15.320]  And we need to all really do it.
[1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:20.320]  That means I need to scan the Internet to find out when Democrats
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:29.520]  are coming to Austin or San Antonio or Dallas or Houston.
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:30.520]  Democrat candidates.
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:33.800]  And I need to go to those events and I need to let the Democrats go
[1:36:33.800 --> 1:36:39.080]  crazy and make a big scene and have my talking points go viral.
[1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:43.000]  Now if you aren't a known person, you're going to be able to go get
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.280]  it right in the front row and bring up key points and take over
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:51.440]  national television on whatever points you think are important.
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:54.280]  Or you can get on an airplane and go to D.C. when they go back into
[1:36:54.280 --> 1:36:56.880]  session and they're going to try to impeach the president.
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:36:59.120]  We should be there.
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:00.120]  You go to D.C.
[1:37:00.120 --> 1:37:05.320]  There'll be maybe 20 Soros funded people at the most important
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:08.000]  hearings you could ever imagine and they all get the press coverage.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  I walk right up.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Boom.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  I get massive press coverage.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.600]  People go, oh, great job going and doing that.
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:17.040]  I'm in a war.
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:19.680]  But the average conservative or Christian is so humble, you're
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:22.000]  like, well, it's not really my place to go do that.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.920]  Hey, you better do it.
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:29.200]  And you better set your alarm and watch C-SPAN in the morning and
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:32.000]  call in to Washington Journal and call in the local talk radio when
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  you're driving to work.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:34.640]  You better do it at lunch.
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:42.120]  You better go eat your lunch in the parking lot and call talk radio.
[1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:44.440]  You better go speak to the legislature.
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:47.520]  You better take your neighbors out shooting and deprogram them.
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:48.800]  We're in a culture war.
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:54.320]  And listen, if we don't win this thing, it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:57.840]  These people have a hunger for power because they want to control the
[1:37:57.840 --> 1:37:59.400]  future of the species.
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:02.760]  They want control over children.
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:06.880]  That's the payola they want.
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:11.880]  The whole cult is about hurting children and draining off their
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:13.680]  potential and their energy.
[1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:19.480]  The whole thing orbits that.
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:23.880]  And we must defend the children, born, unborn.
[1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:27.480]  And we've got to get aggressive in these bullies' faces.
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:30.200]  I mean, every day I see new videos of anti-foot bullying and
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:33.240]  beating up old women on walkers and wheelchairs.
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:37.280]  You go, why would they attack out of a whole crowd of people?
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:40.360]  Why would they go target an old woman going across the street?
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:47.560]  Because when you are a Satanist, you instinctively do the most wicked
[1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:50.600]  thing you can because it feels good.
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:56.000]  A normal person would be embarrassed for weeks, would struggle with it for
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.880]  the rest of their lives bullying an old woman for no reason.
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:00.840]  These people don't have consciousness.
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:02.240]  They love it.
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:09.280]  And when you and I stand down, they take the field and they rule everything.
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:10.920]  The latest footage is on m4s.com.
[1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:13.920]  It needs to get out.
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:16.320]  Now, there's a lot of other geopolitical news.
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:22.600]  Huge fires in golf, new Saudi, high-speed rail station, it got blown up.
[1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:26.640]  Their press is so controlled, you're not going to hear that it's a terror attack.
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:30.960]  They've had half their oil capacity blown up.
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:34.640]  The king's bodyguard got killed yesterday.
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:41.720]  They say it's an accident, move along, no big deal.
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:44.280]  The crown prince came out and said, we don't want war with Iran.
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:45.880]  That would cause a world depression.
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:49.120]  Iran came out and said, we're going to blow up Israel and Saudi Arabia.
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:50.120]  Those are statements.
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:52.600]  Here it is right here.
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:54.720]  For TV viewers.
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:58.080]  Destroying Israel is achievable goal.
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:02.280]  Why do you think Iran is so bold?
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:04.760]  Because they're working with the globalist deep state that believes they're going to
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:07.160]  have Trump out soon.
[1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:12.240]  And they've been green lit to do whatever they want.
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:15.400]  And now there's a civil war again in Saudi Arabia.
[1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:20.440]  By the way, this week, what tomorrow, isn't it, is the two year anniversary of Vegas.
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:22.480]  They still won't tell you to happen there.
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:29.720]  Also Saudi civil war, they had 10,000 Saudi military there for a conference.
[1:40:29.720 --> 1:40:32.640]  They used a gun runner from the CIA to bring them weapons because they couldn't bring them
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:36.280]  into the country.
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:42.280]  And the group against Trump did all that to embarrass Trump.
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:44.240]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff going on.
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:47.920]  That's just one little stack here.
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:50.160]  Massive crackdowns in Hong Kong.
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:55.760]  More military pouring in on the 70th anniversary coming up of Mao's takeover and mass murder
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:40:56.760]  in China.
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:03.640]  And I see articles all over the news, praising Mao and celebrating 70 years of communism
[1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:08.560]  like they're talking about, you know, 70 years of the world's fair or something.
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:13.240]  We're going to go to break, I promise, and come back with J. Vaughn and Brandon and Josh
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:17.840]  and Lillian and Frank and Jack and Kirby and Kim and Peter and Luke and I'm just going
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:20.760]  to move the person to move the next.
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:22.920]  What do you think about their moved impeach Trump?
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:24.600]  Are they going to try to kill him?
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:26.840]  What should we do to counter this?
[1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:31.640]  Because I don't want to just sit here like a spectator while history is happening.
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:35.080]  Don't just go to live democratic events and legally and lawfully take them over in a peaceful
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:37.080]  way.
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:38.080]  What else are you going to do?
[1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:43.400]  You're going to pay for airplanes to drag messages around towns and cities?
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:47.000]  We've got to get the message out that we know the corporate media is a bunch of liars and
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  this country isn't a civil war, but the people running this civil war are anti-Americans
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:55.600]  that say our country shouldn't even exist and our president's bad for saying it shouldn't
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:57.360]  even exist.
[1:41:57.360 --> 1:41:58.520]  But what are your other ideas?
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:04.200]  What do we do now to not be spectators before this gets pushed into a physical civil war
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:08.040]  and we wish we would have worked back when we had a chance to fix things peacefully?
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:10.160]  Because let me tell you something.
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:13.320]  If you're not going to knock on doors now, if you're not going to fly airplane banners
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:16.980]  now, if you're not going to go speak at the state house now, if you're not going to travel
[1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:24.480]  to D.C. and go to these congressmen's offices and speak to them now, you'll never do it
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:25.480]  later.
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:28.240]  Look at dredgerport.com.
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:32.960]  The head of the committee, chief, came out and said impeachment vote by end of the year.
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:35.840]  I already told you Pelosi announced it.
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:41.960]  They're going to have the articles by Thanksgiving and they intend to impeach him by Christmas.
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:42.960]  It's real.
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:43.960]  They're making their move.
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:44.960]  This isn't a joke.
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:49.440]  This is as important as 1776 and the civil war in the 1860s.
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:54.120]  And everybody better get ready and get in position because this is it, boys.
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:43:02.320]  Look, I'm not trying to discourage other bestselling bone broth formulas that sell for 35, 40, 50,
[1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:06.520]  60 bucks retail and are discounted for like $39.95.
[1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:10.920]  But they don't have as much pure concentrated bone broth as we do.
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:12.800]  They don't have as much chocolate mushroom.
[1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:14.840]  They don't have as much beef pollen.
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:18.000]  They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:23.800]  And yes, we've gone out and just made a stronger version of other bestsellers and it's selling
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:24.800]  out.

[1:43:58.640 --> 1:43:59.880]  Trying to fact check the present.
[1:43:59.880 --> 1:44:06.480]  The deceptive, Humpty Dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion,
[1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:12.000]  Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and censor us.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:16.160]  And of course he famously said on many others that Trump is the info wars president.
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:20.920]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:23.200]  say, the info wars president.
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:25.040]  And you know what is true?
[1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:30.080]  Our audience of activists, our guest, our crew and my drive and your drive has brought
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:33.840]  Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world and now Trump's
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:38.480]  openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human
[1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:39.480]  tyrannies.
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:44.040]  This is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now I'm the thick of the fight.

[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:02.680]  a nation we were colonies and now history is repeating itself powerful globalist combines
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:08.920]  that came in and took control of the US and used our power to expand their world empire
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:14.720]  are greedy to maintain control they want to overturn the results of the 2016 election
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:20.800]  but they also want to stop trump from removing the swamp and cutting off their money supply
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:26.360]  from the different client states they've been working with like china russia ukraine and
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:32.120]  many others they've been selling the nation out and now they know the trumps gonna win

[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:55.200]  to have just whistleblower after whistleblower and rape victims come forward and it's going
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:03.680]  to be a hail storm of lies by a pack of known liars but they're going to threaten the senators
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:07.520]  and there's a good chance the senators are going to buckle unless we reach out to all
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:12.920]  those senators and all those new freshman democrats in swing states in the midwest and unless
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:18.920]  we go to all their public events and unless we absolutely get on their tails and let
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:23.740]  the democrats know we're not intimidated they're going to rampage forward all of this letting
[1:49:23.740 --> 1:49:30.080]  them try to engineer civil war and all of them letting antifa attack people has encouraged
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:35.360]  them and the IRS being sicked on conservatives and not even being stopped all of this has
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:43.640]  made them think they can do anything so we have to get back in their faces right now
[1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:48.040]  yes cyberspace is great spreading the live links to info wars dot com forward slash shell

[1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:15.380]  back legally and lawfully you know they're winding up more mass shootings to blame us
[1:50:15.380 --> 1:50:20.000]  you know they're getting ready to bomb buildings and blaming on us you could smell it you can
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:24.280]  see it you know what they did that Oklahoma City in nineteen ninety five they got caught
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:31.640]  Clinton got caught he didn't care he got reelected on it they're gonna use their censorship system
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:37.600]  in your emails and in your voicemail and in your text messages they're in everything
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:41.920]  big tech was built by the globalist for this move against America and they're making their
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:48.840]  move all right we're gonna go to Luke J Von Brandon Josh Lillian Frank Kirby Kim Peter
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:58.880]  and others who's been holding the longest go to J Von in New Jersey J Von your first
[1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:08.960]  up welcome thank you Alex I just wanted to know why isn't the church standing up and
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:15.880]  hitting the streets first if our nation is built on Christendom and that's the foundation
[1:51:15.880 --> 1:51:24.080]  of this country why aren't the men going out and standing up what is it gonna take for
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:29.000]  that to happen well the IRS went after churches and told them they don't have any free speech
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:34.520]  which they do Trump reversed that illegal law but still the average glitterbug preacher
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:39.120]  just wants to be a movie star you know like ugly people going to talk radio people that
[1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:44.400]  can't get into Hollywood become newscasters a lot of these people you again just want
[1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:49.320]  to be movie stars and so they don't really want a church they want a social club and
[1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:54.680]  so they become 501 C3 they follow the world council of churches directives we've lost
[1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:59.960]  the churches but I agree patriots should go into the churches and decide to speak up and
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:04.840]  to ask to speak before the church and any half decent church should have people doing
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:09.280]  that and so the salt of the earth we have to go into these churches that have become
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:15.600]  dens of devils and we have to say hey how about you march for life or how about you
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:20.160]  speak up for our president if churches don't it's a litmus test everyone should leave those
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:27.280]  churches because they're not churches they're nothing but waiting rooms for hell I agree
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:34.280]  it's only one person I hear talking closely related to things that you say on your show
[1:52:34.280 --> 1:52:40.600]  is Dr. Perry Stone and his churches in Cleveland Tennessee he's the only one that really speaks
[1:52:40.600 --> 1:52:46.280]  about this and I think you should have him on the show but Abraham Lincoln said that
[1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:52.880]  this should be talked about on every pulpit I mean God didn't give us a spirit of fear
[1:52:52.880 --> 1:52:58.920]  here's of the devil so why are everybody being afraid to talk about this nobody's talking
[1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:06.360]  about them from if we allow this to get too far it'll be our fault honestly because God
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:11.000]  is watching us what are we willing to put up for we are not meant to be passive we're
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:17.040]  not meant to be so humble that we don't stand for anything well exactly they 12 we're supposed
[1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:20.880]  to be humble about our strengths and gifts God gave us but we're not supposed to be humble
[1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:24.840]  and let them rape children or devil worship and openly take over society we're supposed
[1:53:24.840 --> 1:53:30.200]  to go out and we're supposed to conquer them exactly God bless you my friend you're right
[1:53:30.200 --> 1:53:34.080]  we need the churches to take action and we need the people to go into the churches in
[1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:38.920]  demand they take action anything else he's gone okay thank you sir let's talk to Brandon
[1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:44.960]  in Montana thank you for holding her on the air Brandon hey hi Alex my yeah my name is
[1:53:44.960 --> 1:53:49.880]  Brandon I'm from Montana I've been listening to your show for several years I'm a supporter
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:55.200]  of info wars and I'm just infuriated with what's going on with Donald Trump I voted
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:59.920]  for him he's our legitimate president he won the lictorial college deep state is trying
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:04.880]  to remove him and I think what we need to do as Americans is that I just always calling
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:11.320]  in on shows and talking about hello are you there I'm listening to you sir okay I said
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:15.280]  I just calling in our shows and asking what we need to do we all need to band together
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:21.200]  in a peaceful manner by the way and go to Washington DC and we need to make a statement
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:25.720]  you know we need to sit there and say you are not removing our president Nancy you're
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:30.680]  not going to do this he is lawfully elected he won the lictorial college there was no
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:35.640]  Russian collusion Mueller's report proved that this is a lie this is treason and we
[1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:41.720]  all need to go there with the statement where Trump have literally take a chain go to go
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:45.560]  to a home depot buy a chain buy a paddle lock put your own key with the paddle lock in your
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:50.880]  pocket as a symbol when we say we are chained to the Constitution he is our president he
[1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:55.560]  was elected and Trump himself if he's listening to this message because I know you've said
[1:54:55.560 --> 1:55:00.960]  that he listens to info wars he needs to go on national television and ask the American
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:06.120]  people and I'll be honored to go to Washington DC myself with my family I got a two-year-old
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:10.800]  daughter to worry about and I'll be honored to skip work lose money out of my paycheck
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:16.520]  and I'd be honored to sit there and protest and he needs to go further employers that
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:21.240]  are patriots should let their employees be paid if the employees will spend the money
[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:26.080]  for hotel and everything to go to DC we've all got a chip in however we can and we're
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:30.240]  going to lose everything God bless you and another great idea we need president Trump
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:34.720]  to do televised remarks to the nation about what's happening it's one thing to tweet that
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:38.240]  they want to have martial law and they want to have a civil war and they want to overthrow
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:42.080]  the election and that they're coming after him because he's standing up for us that's
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:48.880]  all true but we need president Trump to come out from the Oval Office and address the criminals
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:54.560]  and the deep state that have sold this nation out and use the power of the presidency to
[1:55:54.560 --> 1:56:01.080]  absolutely annihilate them with a spoken word and then he needs to do an emergency session
[1:56:01.080 --> 1:56:06.960]  to Congress before the state of the union he needs to go there like when they said that
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:11.760]  he he didn't think Jewish senators were being attacked because Trump said you know I've heard
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:16.080]  from law enforcement this is being staged well the cops knew who it was and they ended
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:22.840]  up busting it they tried to claim claim Trump was anti-Israel for that he had to do a special
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:28.040]  early state of the union remember because they were saying he wasn't really president
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:34.120]  and all that crap he needs to do it again he's to do it right now great points we only
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:39.640]  took two calls I'm gonna go fast Lillian Frank everybody Peter when we come back next hour
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:44.400]  I'm going right to your calls we're gonna get your ideas we've already have some amazing
[1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:50.760]  ideas get the churches taking action we need to get Trump to do more televised address not
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:55.400]  just little two minute things or minute long things or 45 second long things from the Rose
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:57:00.840]  Garden he needs to absolutely let the globalists know that we're taking action and you know
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:05.720]  what he is they wouldn't be saying oh bars a traitor he's compromised the attorney general
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:10.600]  must step down if they didn't know the indictments are coming Trump did it he didn't blink the
[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:15.680]  indictments are there it's confirmed they don't have the deputy attorney general say
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:22.880]  no to stopping prosecution unless they green light it's done you want somebody to take
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:27.400]  action he's doing it and he's got all these towers under him that are scared to implement
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:32.920]  it all these people surrounding him lying leaking blocking surprising it anything done
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:37.000]  all he can do is put the info out be stalwart and stand while he's surrounded just like
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:42.360]  info wars America and the world is surrounded by evil but you know what that means we can
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:49.000]  attack in all directions stay with us history is happening right now president Trump is
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:54.080]  trying to remove the swamp the globalists that have been feeding on our nation and selling
[1:57:54.080 --> 1:57:59.040]  us out the chai comms and others that's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the
[1:57:59.040 --> 1:58:05.440]  attorney general bar has to resign because he's corrupt that's because they know that
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:10.560]  he's getting ready to move against the deep state that there are sealed indictments against
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:16.840]  McCabe and others already two weeks ago the appeal by the deputy attorney general was
[1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:21.560]  rejected the appeal was brought to him and it was rejected that means the indictment
[1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:26.200]  is there that's why they're so panicked that's why this impeachment's real of course it's
[1:58:26.200 --> 1:58:30.920]  made up of course it's a fraud but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've
[1:58:30.920 --> 1:58:36.080]  committed so many crimes their back is against the wall and they're making their move right
[1:58:36.080 --> 1:58:41.160]  now this is the time to be fully engaged ladies and gentlemen we're fighting for not just

[2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:53.240]  super popular in fours is super popular the two are interchangeable with minorities everywhere
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:02:58.760]  again that's why the left so panicked everyone is turning against them all they have is election
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:04.360]  fraud to stay in power they want us to be afraid of not wearing our true colors and
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:07.920]  that's all it comes down to alex and i want to say thank you again for the products too

[2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:39.680]  the listeners taking action we're nothing with the symbiotic brother we're in this together
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:43.160]  i know you were talking about gretta i'm going to make this quick all the listeners out there
[2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:50.240]  research your name called severin severin susuki and her father david susuki that was
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:56.800]  gretta 1.0 that was gretta alpha and she it was 12 years old when she stood up in front
[2:03:56.800 --> 2:04:01.520]  of the united nations and gave a word for word almost the same exact speech back in
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:07.320]  the 90s when it was all about global warming i remember that what was it was her name susuki
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:13.800]  it was a severin severin susuki and her dad david susuki he's a complete hypocrite who
[2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:18.080]  told that the the world population is going to die that we should stop having children
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:24.400]  but yet he has five children and severin susuki is wealthy beyond any measure now so i just
[2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:28.960]  want to say thank you alec thank you for everything and god bless you okay be safe well thank
[2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:33.680]  you again that's why i love the callers i totally forgotten about severin susuki i barely

[2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:22.040]  that I've gotten so many guests so much info that I've shifted away from calls we're bringing
[2:06:22.040 --> 2:06:26.480]  calls back as a big part of this show and the other shows that we're producing here
[2:06:26.480 --> 2:06:32.480]  live on air I love it I get these questions from mainstream media but also people on the
[2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:39.360]  street they say are you really for real do you really believe all this of course I believe
[2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:47.560]  all this of course I'm for real and the establishment media constantly tells you that oh I'm an actor
[2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:52.920]  oh jones says he's fake jones says he's not for real really where'd I say that show me
[2:06:52.920 --> 2:07:07.040]  the video show me where I said it show me the audio you can't do it it's lies it's all lies
[2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:10.160]  we told you they're gonna start a civil war we told you they're gonna try to kill the
[2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:14.320]  president we told you they're gonna start impeachment it's all happening and everybody's
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:22.600]  like yeah but there's nothing there it doesn't matter because the congress on average are
[2:07:22.600 --> 2:07:29.040]  a bunch of cowards jim jordan's great deba nunez is amazing a lot of those guys are great
[2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:34.040]  but there's not that many of them and you know the democrats sent a bernie supporter to try
[2:07:34.040 --> 2:07:43.280]  to kill them all at a baseball game remember that but there was one security officer there
[2:07:43.280 --> 2:07:55.320]  with a gun who shot the shooter in one second the guy opened up shot scolese in the hip
[2:07:55.320 --> 2:08:02.640]  through the guts and was down within one second if that wouldn't have happened they could have
[2:08:02.640 --> 2:08:08.480]  killed a lot of those members don't think they won't fly a plane into the capital don't think
[2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:12.760]  they won't blow up a republican train when they're going to one of their yearly retreats
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:17.560]  remember last year it got blown up and the news you said oh the train got stopped no the
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:24.480]  tracks got blown up just like they blew up the trains in Saudi Arabia today and the kings
[2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:32.000]  bodyguard got shot yesterday the oil fields blew up two weeks ago the world is in a war
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:37.720]  between different factions between china and america i've been telling you that for years
[2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:43.560]  and now the unhead came out and said it last week our president gave a speech that was
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:51.720]  incredible just the things he said are devastating to the globalist and so i'm going to ask you
[2:08:51.720 --> 2:08:57.920]  what do we do i don't want to just sit here and take it i'm going to be getting on an
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:09:04.560]  airplane to dc oh yeah and i'm going to be going out and confronting these people but
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:11.480]  i can't get up close like you can't and just simply hit them with whatever their corruption
[2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:17.560]  is every democratic candidate every operative every live show get in there take them over
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:21.000]  it's legal it's waffle it's what they've got the left doing except they're beating up old
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:26.600]  people in wheelchairs and walkers don't do that help a little old ladies across the street
[2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:34.920]  go around the antifa it's a decoy for us to clash with and go find the democrats and take
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:42.680]  over those live tv programs like we did in 2016 with bill clinton's or rapist killery
[2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:48.240]  for prison lock her up because it's all a confidence battle now the president's being
[2:09:48.240 --> 2:09:53.720]  super confident but he is surrounded by traders and cowards and people that have been threatened
[2:09:53.720 --> 2:09:58.720]  and people that have been told when trump goes down if you haven't joined us we're going
[2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:04.800]  to destroy you well why the hell do you want to live like that america was about standing
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:08.520]  up for what you believed in even if it got you killed and because people are willing
[2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:18.960]  to die we had incredible wealth and freedom because tyrants and the corrupt lived in fear
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:28.000]  the creed of slaves is bowing down and hoping that evil passes you over you've gotten in
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:33.800]  this position by licking their boots i won't sit here and be part of it anymore and i'm
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:37.520]  going to tell you as god is my witness if you don't get politically involved in really
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:47.360]  aggressive now and if i don't do it this is not business as usual this is not status
[2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:55.960]  quo it's a hundred percent chance there's going to be a bloody civil war and it's going
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:11:01.120]  to be dirty they're going to false flag and do massacres you've never even imagined and
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:06.600]  blame it on us and it's going to test the very metal of this country so we're up to
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:10.120]  the edge of the cliff right now and if you don't feel it there's something wrong with
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:16.720]  you let me tell you folks people better get on their knees and pray and then you better
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:22.480]  hit the streets and get active and i mean get real active and real aggressive and yeah
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:26.400]  it's great to give trump donations it's great to buy products at info or store to keep us
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:35.880]  on air that's critical but it's just as critical that when nancy polosi and adam schiff and
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:44.080]  all of these horrible dirty criminals are in their congressional offices that you be
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:48.240]  there and then you go there you bring your children with you and you go in there and
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:52.520]  you tell them i know who you are you dirty rat you're going to be brought to justice
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:57.240]  for what you've done and you just need to know in the name of jesus christ that all
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:00.240]  servants of satan are going to be defeated and believe me they know who they serve they're
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:08.040]  scared they will shake them and i want everybody to pray for justice god's justice god's perfect
[2:12:08.040 --> 2:12:15.480]  justice to be brought against polosi and all these type people that's whatever god's justice
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:20.120]  is i don't wish any harm upon them especially because that would make the murders but justice
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:23.800]  that corruption and the evils they've done be brought to light and it is going to be
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:28.600]  brought to light you're going to see incredible corruption come out you're going to see them
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:33.680]  exposed you're going to see how pathetic they are because there's not just evil in the universe
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:38.200]  there's good and as long as we hold the line and don't back down god will take us the rest
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:47.560]  of the way but god wants to see action when they go to their districts you need to be there
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:53.560]  when they go to their offices you need to be there they're your servants not the chai
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:59.800]  coms not the globalist and we've got a real servant in trump and if we don't defend him
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:06.880]  we get what we deserve if you think you're safer hiding out during this you're a fool
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:12.520]  they're coming for everybody lillian in south carolina thanks for holding you're on the
[2:13:12.520 --> 2:13:18.600]  year worldwide on this monday edition thank you so much for calling hi alex i would like
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:25.640]  to just speak to the listeners i listen to the other two callers and they were great
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:33.200]  and i want to encourage them to speak to continue speaking the truth not only speaking the truth
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:39.240]  but being the truth living it and continue to speak the truth and be the truth to the
[2:13:39.240 --> 2:13:48.240]  churches and in the streets everywhere you are but also know that christ said god said
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:54.760]  that it would be a remnant that would be sold out to him but that's okay because he only
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:14:00.960]  needs a remnant that will stand up to this evil this evil has been this deception has
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:07.040]  been going on since the beginning of the time starting with cane and it will continue until
[2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:15.520]  jesus comes back again and so my suggestion of how we can really make a difference than
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:23.720]  fighting this war is if every single person that is a regular listening a listener to
[2:14:23.720 --> 2:14:32.360]  your show would commit to give just five dollars a month faithfully every month until this thing
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:36.800]  is over and again it's not going to be over until jesus comes again but if they would
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:43.280]  commit to just giving five dollars a month let's say there's two million of us faithful
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:51.400]  listeners out there if you multiply five dollars times two million that would be ten million
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:57.520]  dollars a month that alex would be getting in that he could count on well i promise this
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:00.480]  if we get ten million dollars a month there won't be any private jets i'll be flying
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:06.120]  coach i could absolutely change history with ten million dollars a month actual money to
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:09.720]  run things my god ten million dollars extra a year we could do incredible things and i
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:14.480]  know only a fraction go and get things but if people got their toothpaste from us it's
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:19.880]  it's filler free with coilo silver and iodine fluoride free but there's not the silicate
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:23.960]  in it and all the rest of that folks it's just pure toothpaste and if people just got
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:27.760]  their toothpaste and their coffee from us every month we would be able to do it all so i want
[2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:32.720]  to thank you so much you want to add anything else lillian yes alex i do well stay there
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:36.360]  then we got andrew d'orba hopping in for a segment or so or two and we'll go back to

[2:17:54.560 --> 2:18:01.400]  the truth is president trump is the most investigated president in history he is working for american
[2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:06.520]  interest steadfastly he is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:12.040]  our borders bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist chinese control
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:17.160]  who now own hollywood and the majority of our debt we have been maneuvered towards collapse
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:23.200]  and bankruptcy but at the 11th hour 58th minute the american people put a populist in power
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:28.320]  and it's happening all over the world so great things are happening but the enemy is striking
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:34.200]  back they're very serious with this impeachment plan it has bipartisan support and i'm telling

[2:19:57.800 --> 2:20:10.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:30.760]  ending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones from this day on
[2:20:30.760 --> 2:20:37.280]  word from here on after you know i know how serious the global star i've been out to
[2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:42.880]  many of their events from very high levels of their system down to the lowest i've seen
[2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:46.760]  who they serve and that's what my caller is calling and telling me what a great job i'm
[2:20:46.760 --> 2:20:53.640]  doing it's a weird feeling because i know how bad these people are and i'm really mad
[2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:58.920]  at myself for not fighting hard enough and not doing enough i mean we're dealing with
[2:20:58.920 --> 2:21:03.000]  absolute pure evil and the way we've all just been desensitized and put it in this comfort
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:08.640]  zone to live right next to it and then quite frankly i think about other options than info
[2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:13.640]  war and not every path with the brainwashing they've run that only turned out against us
[2:21:13.640 --> 2:21:18.200]  even though it's spiritually right at this point to physically remove these people from
[2:21:18.200 --> 2:21:23.080]  power and president trump's the leader to give those orders he is the commander in chief
[2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:27.240]  we elected him he's now pointing out this is treason he's saying we may have to physically
[2:21:27.240 --> 2:21:30.800]  move against them because they're going to physically move on him and you and your family
[2:21:30.800 --> 2:21:36.560]  in mind and it's a very big time to be alive here ladies and gentlemen i just cannot stress
[2:21:36.560 --> 2:21:44.120]  on you enough the incredible urgency that we are now in and it's so good how god is
[2:21:44.120 --> 2:21:49.640]  helping us in so many ways and the goodness we see across the world and good rising to
[2:21:49.640 --> 2:21:54.040]  the challenge of evil but then it makes it that much more serious when i think about
[2:21:54.040 --> 2:22:00.480]  my children and my three daughters especially how innocent they are and i think about how
[2:22:00.480 --> 2:22:08.600]  good they are and how god created them and i will not turn them over to satan i will
[2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:15.040]  not do it i will leave the delight but the stress of this is i'm really mad at myself
[2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:20.640]  because i don't feel like i'm doing enough and i know how you are as well listeners
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:24.280]  you feel like you're humble and you feel like you're not doing enough but just ask god to
[2:22:24.280 --> 2:22:28.040]  lead god and direct you and together we're gonna do it but you know we're gonna be talking
[2:22:28.040 --> 2:22:32.280]  to andrew torbotton you'll take calls with us as well and then salutes coming up but
[2:22:32.280 --> 2:22:36.120]  i'm gonna take some of that time as well and i just want to encourage all of you to realize
[2:22:36.120 --> 2:22:40.480]  that there is a god in the universe there's not just evil and we're gonna come through
[2:22:40.480 --> 2:22:44.800]  this together but the deep state is moving on the president and the fact that he is for
[2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:49.720]  real the fact that he has so much courage and it's so surrounded it's a microcosm of
[2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:54.520]  our own lives and our children who are surrounded and it just makes me beyond angry it makes
[2:22:54.520 --> 2:23:00.520]  me completely driven to beat these people and i think we're gonna do it but it's gonna
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:04.760]  take getting in their faces and not the way they do it beating up old people and stuff
[2:23:04.760 --> 2:23:09.520]  but i mean rebuking them and i don't mean like some fake church glitter bug i mean
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:14.800]  the real fire of god type stuff and that's gonna come by asking god into you this is
[2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:18.920]  good versus evil let's go to that caller and then i'll go to mr torba and then we'll continue
[2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:22.680]  with calls on here lily and you were making some points though about what trump should
[2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:27.800]  do what we should do and as and as the darkness settles in we can really see it is good versus
[2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:34.000]  evil you know we see all the occultism of jack dorsi coming out everything's being revealed
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:44.480]  at the base of this is satanism yes yes i didn't mean to say this was a or infer that
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:51.360]  this would be a substitute i am i love your the the products that you have i i buy them
[2:23:51.360 --> 2:23:57.480]  my husband and i both take the supplements every day i give them a christmas gift birthday
[2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:04.120]  gift everything i can say that when i um and so and i love them and particularly i do like
[2:24:04.120 --> 2:24:15.560]  a piece it it kind of um gives a little bit of um relief from from that stress but you
[2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:23.240]  like the what particularly ma'am the appease oh absolutely yes i see is that one the happy
[2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:29.440]  though yes happy to get the name of it happy yes the happy yes it's a very it's not a sedative
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:34.680]  it's just mild herbs associated with with by every culture that uses them with with with
[2:24:34.680 --> 2:24:39.840]  being calm it's particularly good for children because it's not a depressant but it's something
[2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:46.200]  that i take at night sometimes when i'm too wound up it's it's excellent but um i feel
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:53.520]  like the i feel like god did give me this idea about the um especially people that can't
[2:24:53.520 --> 2:24:59.680]  do other things i also tell my children about what's going on about what the world is like
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:05.400]  that they're um going to grow up in and i don't want them one day to ask me but grandma
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:13.920]  mom what did you do and something as simple as giving five dollars faithfully each month
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:19.700]  would just make such a big difference and yes ma'am ma'am two percent of the people
[2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:25.080]  that doesn't the side of ever bought anything if just two percent more would would and the
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:28.240]  reason i hate to get to this point because gosh five years ago i could make any amount
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:31.320]  of money i wanted i would stop plugging when i had enough money i wish i would have saved
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:34.640]  a bunch of money but now you've seen what they've done that that's why it's so critical
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:39.160]  so god bless you and i appreciate it but your word of mouth thank you lillian your word
[2:25:39.160 --> 2:25:42.280]  of mouth is paramount that's more important than even by the product so thank you but
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:46.620]  yes folks just get your toothpaste your coffee from info wars and and if folks that have never
[2:25:46.620 --> 2:25:50.880]  bought anything from us at info wars store dot com will just do that every month then
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:55.760]  we are sitting pretty to give them one hell of a fight because i've got big plans but
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:26:00.600]  speaking of one hell of a fight i like andrew torba because he's got a lot of courage and
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:05.960]  he's a great silicon valley programmer who was rising up the ranks the very top he's
[2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:12.200]  a very skilled individual he set up gab with massive users they've tried to set him up
[2:26:12.200 --> 2:26:17.440]  try to take him down they always say build your own thing well he's done it and they're
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:22.080]  coming after him info wars is on there well now they've launched the center that it's
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:27.240]  own free speech web browser which is critical these google web browsers particularly but
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:32.680]  the microsoft ones as well spy on you and now control what you can see and do so i couldn't
[2:26:32.680 --> 2:26:37.400]  think of a better time than to have andrew torba launch the center and again this is
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:42.200]  not an infomercial ladies and gentlemen i'm doing this because i support everyone else
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:48.240]  who is supporting freedom and so everyone should go download the center it's free there's
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:52.920]  so much more and people should all get their own social media on gab thank you for joining
[2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:57.880]  us andrew you haven't been on probably in six months and of course you had the firestorm
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:27:02.320]  with the guy going into the jewish center and shooting people ten seconds after he posted
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:06.960]  on your site when the guy went and shot up christ church and then screamed live on facebook
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:11.960]  they didn't blame uh... zuckerberg but zuckerberg and all of piled on you and wanted you shut
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:17.800]  down just like zuckerberg killed google chrome they don't want any competition absolutely
[2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:23.560]  alex you got me worked up here i just became a father so i just had my daughter in july
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:30.800]  and it makes this war that much more important to me and it centers my focus and god has
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:37.160]  been working in my life god has been working on gab like to say god is on gab and that's
[2:27:37.160 --> 2:27:41.960]  what we have to keep in mind here is that god is on our side we are on the side of good
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:47.080]  and this really is a spiritual war that we are in as you say of good versus evil as you
[2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:50.600]  mentioned i was in silicon valley i was in the belly of the beast i was right next to
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:54.440]  you uh... these people and i know how they think and i know what their next move is
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:58.680]  before they make it and that is not something that we've used to our advantage so well gab
[2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:03.200]  started off as just trying to be a an alternative to twitter we are quickly becoming the silicon
[2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:07.840]  valley alternative uh... you know after last october after the shooting we were no platform
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:12.680]  from payment processors hosting providers domain services uh... you name it everything
[2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:17.240]  probably thirty plus different services which of course you know all too well yourself and
[2:28:17.240 --> 2:28:22.400]  we had no choice but to build all these things from the ground up including a web browser
[2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:25.480]  uh... and that's what we've done now with the center
[2:28:25.480 --> 2:28:29.240]  let's come back and talk about it because you've been through the fire and it's made
[2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:33.080]  you stronger and if it wasn't for the listeners of this show and others you would not be there
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:37.280]  but you have been through living hell uh... and again what they've done to you is the
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:41.300]  model for everyone else they're now coming out to the nr a with the exact same terrorist
[2:28:41.300 --> 2:28:45.240]  tactics ladies and gentlemen hang together or hang separate we'll be back with andrew

[2:33:37.360 --> 2:33:43.720]  all the rest of it but i want to raise this point to you reddit landed a hundred fifty
[2:33:43.720 --> 2:33:52.640]  million dollar funding from a chinese communist government run operation and within two months
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:58.000]  they banned the donald and froze it i happen to know the inside baseball about at all i'm
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:03.400]  not at liberty to tell anybody yet but i'm working like a little busy beaver to get this
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:11.440]  to the president you talk about criminal now torba and the people he has with him have
[2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:15.560]  been through hell i know because i was interviewing him a lot behind the scenes when the stuff
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:19.200]  went down last year and i don't blame some of the folks that were with them they they
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:24.320]  tapped out but he hasn't tapped out of now he's found folks to go to the next level we're
[2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:28.160]  going to talk about that but i talked to torba and i said hey let me guess i bet you've been
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:33.080]  offered a bunch of money to sell out gab because yeah of course and see that's the thing not
[2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:38.360]  everybody sells out there is good in the world and when i shot that video yesterday we put
[2:34:38.360 --> 2:34:44.200]  it out learn who sold their soul to satan it's gone viral since people are blown away when
[2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:47.600]  i show clips of all these hollywood people saying they sold their soul to the devil and
[2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:57.200]  people like bob dillon well in blues itself you were so it's like a form of voodoo you're
[2:34:57.200 --> 2:35:02.600]  supposed to sell yourself so that's the whole point so that's what he did what i'm talking
[2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:08.200]  about is really going on whether you believe it's art table or whether it's physical a
[2:35:08.200 --> 2:35:16.360]  real spirit these people have signed on to something very bad and people like oh my gosh
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:21.600]  you you know you turn down ten million dollars a year people say well why don't you tell us
[2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:24.360]  well no one you have those agreements with people and it's off record what they're doing
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:27.760]  is not criminal and you say i'm not gonna ever talk about this meeting i mean i've signed
[2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:31.680]  on disclosures you name it i mean i didn't sign on disclosures recently with some of
[2:35:31.680 --> 2:35:37.040]  the most powerful people in the world because they wanted to talk to me and then i told
[2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:46.440]  them piss up a row and then the pressure came again but you need to understand this is real
[2:35:46.440 --> 2:35:50.400]  and mark dice was offered because i know people involved i called him up i said i heard you're
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:55.400]  getting the show with these people i mean we mean household names he said no i wouldn't
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:59.800]  pledge to lucifer he goes i used to think you're crazy about that they actually asked me the
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:04.000]  head of the company in a boardroom said i work at lucifer and i want you to hold my hand
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:10.480]  and pledge to lucifer and then we'll give you this big contract sit in the game folks
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:15.680]  i've had him do that to me this is real okay and it's not like they're just trying to keep
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:23.240]  christians out of the organization or something they mean it they mean it let's go back to
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:28.280]  you and i appreciate you joining us from gab you're launching this new incredible browser
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:32.160]  i'm going to load it on everything i've been so busy i knew you had new stuff going on
[2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:36.440]  and i'm going to get it loaded on everything tell us about it tell us how people get it
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:42.120]  sure you go to a dissenter dot com d i s s e n t r and it is one of the fastest probably
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:46.360]  the fastest web browser and the reason for that is because we're automatically blocking
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:51.560]  all of big text trackers all of their ads so a lot of the stuff that is slowing down
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:55.200]  your web browsing is going to be blocked and not only that alex the most important thing
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:37:00.520]  about the center is that it is cutting off the enemy's funds it's cutting off the enemy's
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:05.280]  access to your data which they then turn around and sell for advertisements which then they
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:10.320]  make billions of dollars on that you get nothing back in return for so that is one of the biggest
[2:37:10.320 --> 2:37:14.080]  things is that it's it's cutting them off it's cutting them off their access to their to
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:18.520]  your data it's cutting off access to them making money off of your browsing history so that's
[2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:23.240]  number one but the second layer of this is that it also has our browser extension built
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:28.320]  in which is a free speech comment section so you can go to places like cnn or fox news
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:32.520]  or places that have comment sections turned off and using your gab account you can now
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:36.200]  comment and see what other people I know when you were building this six months ago they
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:41.480]  slipped out and said should that even be legal for them to create a comment section that overlays
[2:37:41.480 --> 2:37:45.360]  it yummy out there then because again everybody knows comment sections the most popular thing
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:49.000]  of any news site the fact of the last five years they've been getting rid of them really
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:53.440]  is them running up the white flag yeah as soon as we launched this that's actually when
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:37:59.120]  apple banned our app store developer account we tried submitting the dissenter browser
[2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:03.720]  as an iOS app and it was just a simple web browsing app but that's when they said no you're
[2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:08.560]  getting kicked off of not only not only rejecting the app but we're kicking you off as a developer
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:13.560]  completely so you can no longer submit that is pure monopoly behavior textbook example
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:18.960]  sorry go ahead absolutely absolutely no apple and google have a duopoly on mobile app distribution
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:24.240]  they control 98% market share so you know you have a company like ours that isn't doing
[2:38:24.240 --> 2:38:28.840]  anything illegal we're following us law and they won't let us participate in the marketplace
[2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:32.680]  because frankly we compete with them and we complete with companies that they're partnered
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:39.240]  with like like twitter you know I got reminded of this today watching David night show with
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:42.600]  Harrison Smith is really a smart guy and I mean everybody's smart around here but he's
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:46.800]  really smart for his age he bought the Jones Act that was passed like 40 years ago I'd
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:52.240]  forgotten about this you know why we get everything from China there's a federal law that US ships
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:57.040]  can't dock at a US port and then go to another US port if it's for commerce they have to
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:02.600]  go to a foreign port it's designed so we don't have any industry I mean my god and Trump's
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:06.720]  trying to get rid of the Jones Act right now right yeah I mean it's the same thing with
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:11.840]  big tech right it's it's all rigged there's this facade this illusion of choice oh there's
[2:39:11.840 --> 2:39:15.600]  you know 100 different apps but the reality is that they're all owned by two or three
[2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:19.600]  companies right so you have Facebook that owns Instagram and WhatsApp and Messenger and
[2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:24.480]  all the top 20 apps on the app stores are basically owned by two or three companies and that's
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:29.920]  one of the reasons why I started cap I personally as a consumer just wanted choice and you know
[2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:34.240]  we you know they told they told us to build our own and we did and you see how that worked
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:38.480]  out we've been no platform from everything and now again and instead of us just being
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:42.360]  you know a social networking alternative we're now going to be releasing this browser we
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:46.960]  have an email service coming up we had to build our own payments infrastructure so you
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:51.280]  know we have everything and ideally we're going to partner and offer this infrastructure
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:56.920]  with other folks who are also being no platform like yourself and others and build this ecosystem
[2:39:56.920 --> 2:40:03.840]  that that can't be touched and cannot be stopped that's my great crew hey we've got to promote
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:08.120]  gab we got to promote telegram and other systems we got to do it right now and I've just been
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:13.200]  very pleased to see you explode and it seems to get stronger after you know it looked like
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:17.440]  you might have to shut down last year how the hell did you do it how'd you power through
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:22.200]  it's people it's it's our community just like you we depend on our people and they make
[2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:27.320]  it happen they are our investors they are customers they are donors without them gab
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:32.880]  would have been dead years ago and you know thankfully we have a very strong core community
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:38.360]  that keeps gab going and believes in gab believes in me believes in what we're doing and knows
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:43.160]  the importance of what we're doing as well I mean we literally have no other choices
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:48.560]  out there like it's you silicon valley tech or you know you're not allowed to be a person
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:51.400]  on the internet you're not allowed to engage in commerce on the internet you're not allowed
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:55.520]  to speak on the internet and that's not a world that I want my daughter to grow up in
[2:40:55.520 --> 2:41:01.800]  you know I want the internet to be preserved and conserved as the free and open web for
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:08.080]  all people and I want to export American liberties and American values of freedom of speech and
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:13.040]  privacy and all these things to millions of people around the world who don't enjoy those
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:20.640]  things 1776 worldwide yes exactly exactly you know a lot of these things this is scary right
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:25.120]  we have new york city this week coming out and saying you're going to get fined $250,000
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:29.760]  if you call someone an illegal alien if you ask them to by the way I totally forgot to
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:33.240]  cover that the last three days and I went and read it I thought this is a fake headline
[2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:42.880]  it says if our if our hate board of leftist decided anyway and they gave examples if you
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:49.240]  kick illegals out because they didn't pay the rent $250,000 fine I mean this is like
[2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:53.080]  the Soviet Union and again there's nothing to do with the illegal aliens it's all about
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:58.920]  globalists getting fines in their names right it's it's criminalizing speech and this is
[2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:03.520]  sure to be challenged in the courts this is a blatant flagrant violation of the First
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:07.160]  Amendment of the United States of America and I wouldn't be surprised Alex if we see
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:12.000]  other cities like San Francisco Chicago and others start to follow this trend it's all
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:15.520]  written up by the UN and then deployed against us called mutualization stay there we're going
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:19.600]  to take some calls Andrew Dora and folks he's been busy building all this stuff and busy
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:24.040]  having a baby with his wonderful life and finally able to get him back on this is awesome
[2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:28.840]  and I'm telling you it's so exciting and we just all got to get out there and use gab
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:32.400]  we've got to use dissenter and we'll give you those URLs and come back we're gonna go
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:35.880]  right to your calls though because you'll want to talk about how do we stop impeachment
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:39.840]  or how do we counter how they're trying to openly cause a hot civil war I mean everything
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:44.320]  we've talked about is now mainstream news it's all happening but we're not being caught
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:48.200]  flat footed but I'm telling you my spidey sense is off the chain right now something
[2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:58.200]  big is about to happen history is happening right now president trump is trying to remove
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:02.760]  the swamp the globalists that have been feeding on our nation and selling us out of the chai
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:07.920]  comms and others that's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the attorney general
[2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:14.840]  bar has to resign because he's corrupt that's because they know that he's getting ready
[2:43:14.840 --> 2:43:19.720]  to move against the deep state that there are sealed indictments against mccabe and
[2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:25.960]  others already two weeks ago the appeal by the deputy attorney general was rejected the
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:30.640]  appeal was brought to him and it was rejected that means the indictment is there that's
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:35.240]  why they're so panic that's why this impeachment's real of course it's made up of course it's
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:39.760]  a fraud but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've committed so many
[2:43:39.760 --> 2:43:45.240]  crimes their back is against the wall and they're making their move right now this is
[2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:50.120]  the time to be fully engaged ladies and gentlemen we're fighting for not just our nation but
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:55.240]  the world's future america is fighting for its life do you feel that my style is wrong
[2:43:55.240 --> 2:44:00.640]  or my substance is wrong trying to fact check the present the deceptive Humpty Dumpty troll
[2:44:00.640 --> 2:44:07.200]  known as brian stelter his little weasel minion oliver darcy have made it their life's mission
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:11.920]  to take patriots off the air and censor us and of course he famously said on many others
[2:44:11.920 --> 2:44:17.400]  that trump is the info wars president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases

[2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:47.320]  is out there the fact that ban dot videos out there the fact that we're still on talk
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:53.040]  radio you know rage is the globalist and the fact that our talking points that are based
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:57.440]  purely in reality are now the talking points of rush limbaugh Tucker Carlson you name it
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:48:02.840]  is incredible now I'm not going to name drop here is not bragging but to show you how effective
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:13.240]  we are this weekend I talked to not one not two but three different very prominent people
[2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:18.080]  that reached out to me just separately and it was all the same narrative because they
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:24.280]  tend to think like I'm the most vanguard of this and they want to know what I think is
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:29.240]  going on even though these people are very smart and very articulate so that just shows
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:36.400]  you where info wars is I mean you know Stephen Miller's listen every day you know that that
[2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:40.760]  that the president understands what's going on and we're still here there's not just evil
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:47.720]  in the world there's good as well now that said it's like knowing like you ever heard
[2:48:47.720 --> 2:48:52.360]  like your cousin or your family you hear about him getting carjacked or rob and you physically
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:58.360]  feel pissed you feel empathy and you want to hurt who's doing it and it'd be one thing
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:01.600]  the democrats were just the old fashioned corrupt democrats and okay yeah they're gonna
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:06.280]  try to steal things these people know we're kicking their ass and they want full control
[2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:11.600]  for authoritarianism you think stuff's bad now I'm physically in total fight mode I'm
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:16.400]  not gonna do anything physical but intellectually my brain has done the net math I've looked
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:21.920]  at it and I can't help my brain now not going into combat mode doesn't mean I'm gonna do
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:26.280]  anything I'm not they're starting combat mode because they're losing the info war but I'm
[2:49:26.280 --> 2:49:32.760]  here to tell you folks I've been on air 25 years and you could take 25 of the years they
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:40.960]  don't compete with what's happening now energetically I mean man and I'm telling you they're doing
[2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:47.480]  some bad stuff right now folks but it's all gonna come out and it's gonna be one hell
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:51.520]  of a fight and then again we're gonna win this thing the devil only rules for one hour
[2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:57.160]  for about I want to go to these calls with you for a couple of seconds we gotta go understand
[2:49:57.160 --> 2:50:02.840]  you're on the tight schedule we're just enclosing please come back soon for a full hour what
[2:50:02.840 --> 2:50:06.360]  do you think Trump should do how what would you call this period of history we're in right
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:12.640]  now and I just I mean you're doing a lot and I know I'm doing a lot and the listeners
[2:50:12.640 --> 2:50:15.920]  are doing a lot but I just thought we should do more what would you call this period of
[2:50:15.920 --> 2:50:19.880]  time and what do you think Trump should do what should we do
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:26.560]  we are in a war for the soul of this country and in a war for freedom and this is a spiritual
[2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:32.840]  war we need to pray first and foremost get close to God go to church you know bring
[2:50:32.840 --> 2:50:38.000]  God into your family that's number one because that's how we're gonna be stable and secure
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:43.520]  amen with our actions going forward so number two is we need to wake people up who are sleep
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:49.480]  walking through history and we need to have empathy and understand that a lot of them
[2:50:49.480 --> 2:50:52.360]  are just going about their day to day day maybe they don't watch the news they're not
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:56.400]  following on what's going on in politics or what's happening with the Silicon Valley
[2:50:56.400 --> 2:51:02.240]  tyrants silencing people on the internet but just educate them and have an open conversation
[2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:06.380]  and wake people up one by one and that's how we're gonna win as far as this impeachment
[2:51:06.380 --> 2:51:11.360]  stuff I think it's it's ultimately going to play into Trump's hand the Democrats are
[2:51:11.360 --> 2:51:15.400]  clearly desperate you look at any of the candidates that they have you watch these debates and
[2:51:15.400 --> 2:51:22.760]  it's like a clown show not one person on that stage is going to be Trump I agree with you
[2:51:22.760 --> 2:51:28.880]  100% okay 100% right but they've got the votes in the house and they can they can twist
[2:51:28.880 --> 2:51:32.760]  our the Senate I'm they think they're getting rid of him and I agree with you it's making
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:37.360]  Trump stronger that's why this is so explosive I mean this is the moveable object runs into
[2:51:37.360 --> 2:51:42.360]  the unstoppable force right right exactly I don't think he's gonna get impeached I think
[2:51:42.360 --> 2:51:46.920]  they're gonna try and it's again it's only gonna play into his hand with this anti-establishment
[2:51:46.920 --> 2:51:52.840]  narrative because now once again just like during 2016 election he's up against the establishment
[2:51:52.840 --> 2:51:58.440]  of Congress in the establishment of Beltway DC and the establishment media and he's winning
[2:51:58.440 --> 2:52:02.760]  right and things are coming out and proving that's why they're in panic mode but that's
[2:52:02.760 --> 2:52:07.440]  what makes them so dangerous right exactly and and this is why speech is so important
[2:52:07.440 --> 2:52:10.920]  to and this is why they're cracking down is because people are getting the truth out
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:14.440]  people aren't reliant on the media anymore they're getting their information from other
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:20.720]  sources from individuals from places like inforce from places like gab where it's whether
[2:52:20.720 --> 2:52:27.160]  it's the thornburg or whether it's Trudeau everything they do falls on its face well
[2:52:27.160 --> 2:52:30.960]  yeah of course I mean all these people have skeletons in their closet and it's just inevitable
[2:52:30.960 --> 2:52:35.320]  that it eventually comes out and and this is karma and this is this has got it well
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:39.400]  I think our liberals constantly even in Europe they're constantly in blackface I've never
[2:52:39.400 --> 2:52:44.120]  been in blackface never yeah no I just I don't understand it you think that they would understand
[2:52:44.120 --> 2:52:49.440]  and you know some of the people that project you know anti-racism or social justice ironically
[2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:56.360]  end up being the most racist people I've never heard the n-word until I was in college and
[2:52:56.360 --> 2:53:00.560]  then I went on road trips and I'm and northerners are great most wonderful but I mean I that's
[2:53:00.560 --> 2:53:05.120]  when I heard n-word and stuff was in the north and I mean the people like the south gets
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:10.320]  your ass killed doing that man I mean right down here I mean I've never heard anybody
[2:53:10.320 --> 2:53:14.480]  to talk bad about black people I mean you know we're Christians and we don't put people
[2:53:14.480 --> 2:53:18.400]  down to make ourselves bigger and it's just this idea the south's a bunch of racists
[2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:23.640]  is a load of crap yeah exactly I mean if you're a Christian if you're a straight white male
[2:53:23.640 --> 2:53:29.240]  if you're you know someone who's off the plantation or the Democrat plantation or thinking for
[2:53:29.240 --> 2:53:33.560]  yourself or you know you're gonna get attacked you're gonna get smeared and we are the great
[2:53:33.560 --> 2:53:37.640]  oppressors but you know the reality is is that we're the ones that are speaking the
[2:53:37.640 --> 2:53:42.280]  truth right we're speaking truth to power and we're winning and again like I said earlier
[2:53:42.280 --> 2:53:46.920]  we have God on our side so no matter what happens we we can't lose but you know I get
[2:53:46.920 --> 2:53:52.120]  emotional too now that I'm a father this stuff is so it's so crucial what happened what happened
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:59.040]  once you saw that baby some switches go around didn't they big time big time and just like
[2:53:59.040 --> 2:54:04.120]  you said you know I went into full-on you know fight or flight it's it's time this is
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:08.000]  the time we have to rise now we have to fight back against this because we're gonna wake
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:11.520]  up one day and we're not gonna be able to say anything on the internet we're not gonna
[2:54:11.520 --> 2:54:17.120]  be able to open a bank account you know the mark of the beast stuff is is coming and you
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:21.360]  know we better be prepared for it and we better have alternative infrastructure in place for
[2:54:21.360 --> 2:54:27.280]  before that and that's why they taught the rapture any fool could read Revelation Christ
[2:54:27.280 --> 2:54:30.720]  comes back than the dead of Christ or risen then there's a thousand years of Christ and
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:34.480]  it all makes perfect sense now there's a world government the world government takes over
[2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:39.360]  for a little while a day an hour and in time it's probably not even like a year they're
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:43.920]  gonna get their total AI health system and then it's all gonna fall it's all gonna get
[2:54:43.920 --> 2:54:47.920]  powered down it's all gonna get wiped out and so so these churches and everybody are thinking
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:53.400]  they're gonna get raptured it's not in the Bible it's a lie well the other thing too
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:57.480]  is that there are multiple antichrists right and they're here right now the Christ yes many
[2:54:57.480 --> 2:55:02.840]  antichrists right exactly and and who's to say that the AI is an antichrist right and that's
[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:08.360]  what the image of the beach right yeah that's their ultimate goal is to have us all policed and
[2:55:08.920 --> 2:55:13.880]  you know controlled with this AI and using the data that they have to control what we can say
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:18.200]  what we can share who can engage in commerce what is news what isn't you know who you're
[2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:21.640]  supposed to vote for who you're not supposed to vote for and if not then your life is going
[2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:24.680]  to be destroyed you're not going to be able to make any money you're not going to be able to get
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:29.320]  a job you're not going to be able to have a presence on the internet that is a totalitarian
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:35.400]  control and the only way to go ahead no I just can say the only way that we beat it is by building
[2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:40.120]  we can't rely on government we can't rely on you know anyone to come and save us we have to
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:43.800]  save ourselves and the only way that we save ourselves is by building and that's exactly
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:47.080]  what we've been doing for three years now and that's exactly what we're going to continue to do
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:51.000]  going forward it's what you've been doing for 25 plus years as well exactly so again we're
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:58.760]  going to people go to download the browser dissenter.com and of course get on gab gab.com
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:03.240]  all right Andrew thank you so much for the time god bless you thank you god bless ox

[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:19.560]  they're coming they're climbing over the damn parapet they're coming they're coming they're
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:23.080]  coming it's not a question now they're going to try to remove Trump they're going to blow
[2:56:23.080 --> 2:56:27.240]  up federal buildings they're going to do mass shootings okay just get ready I guarantee you
[2:56:27.240 --> 2:56:32.040]  it's all happening just get ready and you can see it and you know it and there's no doubt about it
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:36.200]  and I'm just going to tell everybody if you climb under the bed they're going to dig your
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:41.160]  ass out of there we're going to ride out we're going to face these people politically and
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:45.320]  we're going to have victory the likes of which we've never seen then there's going to be a long
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:52.200]  ai takeover after that but this is getting the groundwork to go through the next big challenge
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:56.120]  once we've beaten these little globalists we're going to look at the next level we've got to face
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:57:01.960]  and go man wow we wish we had them as enemies I'm telling you I've foreseen it I've studied it I
[2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:07.320]  know what's going to happen it's going to be rough folks but on the other side of this is going to
[2:57:07.320 --> 2:57:11.720]  be real human potential you look at how far we've come in our species and where we're at now just a
[2:57:11.720 --> 2:57:17.960]  few more inches and we are I mean it is amazing but you don't get all that power without being tested
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:22.280]  and the power we're going to begin we're going to throw it back at God and say we don't want this
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:30.120]  I mean it's amazing but you cannot be given more power than Satan ever imagined if you haven't been
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:34.680]  tested ladies and gentlemen we'll be right back on the other side please don't forget Black Friday

[2:58:16.760 --> 2:58:20.920]  want to say why not well you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible whether
[2:58:20.920 --> 2:58:25.240]  it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the dna force with the
[2:58:25.240 --> 2:58:29.560]  coq 10 and bio pqq and all the rest of it all of these are things that are like rocket fuel on
[2:58:29.560 --> 2:58:34.200]  the body you take these bases together then you have your foundation now you can build the big
[2:58:34.200 --> 2:58:38.200]  strong temple with these products I take when I religiously remember to take them it makes my
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:42.680]  life so much better and then it funds the information war which is so critical thank you so much god
[2:58:42.680 --> 2:58:50.200]  bless you the truth is president trump is the most investigated president in history he is working
[2:58:50.200 --> 2:58:56.360]  for american interests steadfastly he is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to
[2:58:56.360 --> 2:59:02.040]  break our borders bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist chinese control
[2:59:02.040 --> 2:59:07.400]  who now own hollywood and the majority of our debt we have been maneuvered towards a collapse in
[2:59:07.400 --> 2:59:13.320]  bankruptcy but at the eleventh hour 58th minute the american people put a populist in power and
[2:59:13.320 --> 2:59:18.840]  it's happening all over the world so great things are happening but the enemy is striking back
[2:59:18.840 --> 2:59:24.440]  you're very serious with this impeachment plan it has bipartisan support and i'm telling you
[2:59:24.440 --> 2:59:29.960]  president trump needs our prayers and info wars needs your prayers and support ladies and gentlemen
[2:59:29.960 --> 2:59:33.880]  the globalists are trying to shut us down but right now it's easier than ever to financially

[3:00:03.800 --> 3:00:09.160]  i apologize now we're gonna go to uh frank and then julie and kirby and everybody uh
[3:00:10.040 --> 3:00:15.160]  frank thanks for holding from georgia you're on the air worldwide alex your patriot you're awesome
[3:00:15.160 --> 3:00:21.000]  the one thing we could do as a minimum is stay vocal for our support for chrump we we can't hide it
[3:00:21.000 --> 3:00:27.320]  um additionally use gap not facebook don't use chrome get the center i mean could you imagine
[3:00:27.320 --> 3:00:31.320]  if you had a pervert mailman that read all your mail and then soldier information it's
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:36.920]  ridiculous um oh you'd be pissed but but but because you opt into the roach motel people
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:42.280]  think it's okay absolutely i mean everyone listening right now six five people the link to
[3:00:42.280 --> 3:00:47.960]  band dot video i'm seriously and it i mean the word can spread fast if we just have to take action
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:54.520]  by the way i was talking to katlyn menant last night she doesn't get my band dot video text on her
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:01:01.720]  uh droid galaxy seven or galaxy ten excuse me and i started talking to other people they're
[3:01:01.720 --> 3:01:05.240]  not getting band dot video and that's the new thing they say is they're going to block it at
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:12.200]  the browser level in the phones in the operating system so folks they're getting ready to make
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:17.000]  their move that's all i can say and we have a chance to stop it but that's why i'm desperate
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:21.320]  to try to figure out what it is we do to reverse it and i think you're right they're trying to
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:25.800]  intimidate trump and people around him to think he's going to lose we have to swarm dc but instead
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:31.160]  of always swarming you know the mall and then nobody covers it the halls of the senate in the
[3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:36.360]  house you go right through you go right to their damn offices get in there and get in their faces
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:43.560]  in a legal and lawful way anything else frank oh yes sir um trumps going toe-to-toe with these
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:47.560]  bloodthirsty anti-american globalists the least we can do uh it's the least we can do to fight
[3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:53.640]  these epsteens these ed bucks these biden the poor infant wars the poor local business i can tell
[3:01:53.640 --> 3:01:59.240]  you firsthand that as an antibacterial antiviral the x2 is as effective on animals as it is on
[3:01:59.240 --> 3:02:03.560]  people my family and i went on vacation we had to board our dog my dog came down with kennel
[3:02:03.560 --> 3:02:07.800]  cough when i got back i gave my dog one drop of x2 for two days and on the third day the kennel
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:13.480]  cough was cured now it didn't die everything worked out great and alex thanks for everything god
[3:02:13.480 --> 3:02:20.440]  bless you you know i don't want to say iodine is a miracle but if you don't have water in the
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:26.120]  desert and you find an oasis and get a bunch of water it's a miracle you die without iodine
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:32.600]  there's almost none of it in the soil what's in the ocean is contaminated still better than nothing
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:38.520]  we have pure real atomic iodine and by the way nobody else goes out and goes to the dea to get
[3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:43.400]  it and have a dea stored in a facility i go with the top lab in the country everybody else just
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:48.680]  says they have atomic no they don't no they don't no they don't if you take regular iodine eat a
[3:02:48.680 --> 3:02:54.600]  damn hole in your stomach because it's bound to a bunch of crap it's not iodine and again it freaks
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:59.800]  me out folks that we've been selling this seven years and that nobody went out and did it i'm
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:05.240]  telling you how you do it nobody else goes out and does it nobody else goes to the oil companies

[3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:15.000]  obligated alex to ask for contributions that would be graciously given if you would set up an organized
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:22.840]  way so that we your listeners millions of christians around the world those that are conservative
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:27.240]  we would support you well stay there let's come back and talk about that it's just and trump's
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:31.400]  taking some of the heat off of it but you do have 501 whatever and then they can control what you do
[3:04:31.400 --> 3:04:35.480]  but yes we need to do it and and listen just as we get deeper into this i've always been a christian
[3:04:35.480 --> 3:04:40.440]  now it's totally obvious you can see it the devil's real god's real they're killing children
[3:04:40.440 --> 3:04:47.160]  after they're born now so uh people are all look at kanye west is found christ it's just it's going
[3:04:47.160 --> 3:04:55.080]  to happen you're going to join satan or you're going to join god band dot video is the answer to
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:05:02.120]  censorship band dot video is the answer for libertarians conservatives nationalists pro gun
[3:05:02.120 --> 3:05:10.040]  pro life pro human individuals to have their own platform wear videos banned by youtube facebook
[3:05:10.040 --> 3:05:15.800]  and twitter are still available we've launched it ladies and gentlemen it's now live banned
[3:05:15.800 --> 3:05:21.720]  dot video banned dot video isn't just going to be a home for alex jones or david knight or
[3:05:21.720 --> 3:05:27.560]  oan shroyer or paul watson banned videos we are building it to be a place where banned memes are
[3:05:27.560 --> 3:05:33.560]  able to be posted and we're a growing list of freedom loving contributors are able to have a home
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:39.400]  free for being shut down free from being censored free from being silenced by big tech the chai
[3:05:39.400 --> 3:05:46.760]  comms the hollywood scum and the globlest freedom of speech has a home it's called banned dot video
[3:05:46.760 --> 3:06:09.720]  america and the world is fighting back against tyranny at banned dot video
[3:06:09.720 --> 3:06:20.680]  live from austin texas it's alex jones we could definitely set up just a pro christ
[3:06:20.680 --> 3:06:25.560]  pro free speech organization i'm never like a Pharisee trying to claim on mr goody two shoes
[3:06:25.560 --> 3:06:30.520]  i have my problems i get angry uh but this is a good versus evil fight and i you don't see most
[3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:35.320]  the church is actually getting into what's happening prophecy being fulfilled it's all happening it's
[3:06:35.320 --> 3:06:43.160]  all real the satanist the whole nine yards and so that the callers write um people either need to
[3:06:43.160 --> 3:06:48.120]  find a church that's fighting the new world order or they need to donate to something like info wars
[3:06:48.120 --> 3:06:52.200]  for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers
[3:06:52.200 --> 3:06:55.640]  against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness
[3:06:56.200 --> 3:07:01.880]  in high places you can go on basically you know you know talk about in the cosmos uh in space this
[3:07:01.880 --> 3:07:07.800]  this evil of the prince power the air uh but that's what's going on and it's very very real
[3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:14.360]  and it wants your children for eternity uh so kim what else do you think trump needs to do
[3:07:14.360 --> 3:07:20.440]  what do you think's about to happen well first of all first of all alex nobody says it better than
[3:07:20.440 --> 3:07:28.920]  you including 99 of the pastors in this country okay nobody says it clearer than you do i think
[3:07:28.920 --> 3:07:35.720]  we're in the kingdom of god i think trump is going to be victorious i think the american people are
[3:07:35.720 --> 3:07:42.680]  going to be victorious i know christians will be victorious and that's why you need us behind you
[3:07:42.680 --> 3:07:51.800]  we need to be giving to your efforts on a monthly basis a commitment a commitment to your ministry
[3:07:51.800 --> 3:07:59.800]  and we will definitely defeat satan and his armies so we've got the bigger army we've got
[3:07:59.800 --> 3:08:05.480]  the bigger stick his name is jesus christ and i might throw donald trump in there along with him
[3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:11.080]  those two guys can't be defeated i'll say trump definitely used to be worldly but like he said
[3:08:11.080 --> 3:08:15.160]  he's changed and i know people that know him well trump really has seen some things god's
[3:08:15.160 --> 3:08:19.080]  used trump and that's what the bible shows in history god doesn't usually pick some perfect
[3:08:19.080 --> 3:08:23.880]  goody tissues god picks all sorts of people god bless you i appreciate your call i just want to
[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:29.240]  get back to this if you go out to democratic events or you go behind the scenes with them you
[3:08:29.240 --> 3:08:33.880]  get around hollywood they're a bunch of devil worshipers they're not atheist they tell you
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:37.720]  they're atheist because they don't want you to know there's a spirit world it's real folks we only
[3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:45.240]  see a limited amount can you guys cue up from yesterday bob dillon on 60 minutes and and he's
[3:08:45.240 --> 3:08:54.040]  in larger interviews talking about it and again folks um here's a clip of bob dillon talking about
[3:08:54.040 --> 3:08:58.680]  making a deal with the devil you're out here doing these songs you know you're still on tour
[3:08:59.640 --> 3:09:04.680]  i do but i don't take it for granted why do you still do it why are you still out here
[3:09:04.680 --> 3:09:11.640]  well it goes back to the destiny thing and i made it up bargain with it you know long time ago and
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:21.720]  i'm holding up my hand what was your bargain to get where i am now should i ask who you made the
[3:09:21.720 --> 3:09:30.520]  bargain with with with with with you know with the chief chief commander on this earth and this earth
[3:09:30.520 --> 3:09:36.920]  and uh and then in the world we can't see bob dillon i want to be clear that 60 minutes and he
[3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:41.320]  goes into it more in other interviews where he actually went met with the devil made the deal
[3:09:41.320 --> 3:09:45.240]  suddenly could sing with all the stuff but i want to tell you something it's very faustian
[3:09:46.280 --> 3:09:52.440]  i'm personally not going to get into all this because it's so fantastical it just sounds like
[3:09:52.440 --> 3:09:56.520]  a movie but let me tell you the stuff you see in movies is from real stuff and the devil
[3:09:56.520 --> 3:10:00.760]  isn't omnipresent like god but the devil can follow families and groups and people
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:07.800]  and knows uh and understands potentials of individuals and i had like i told you in dallas
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:14.360]  real satanist not not your poke's killer dog in the back of the trailer park the real thing try to
[3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:22.120]  recruit me okay the real deal and so i realized all along my life as all of our lives has been
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:26.520]  training and preparation so that when the real weight gets put on me i don't think i'm going to
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:33.800]  falter uh and you know uh that's really what this is and and and and that's it i mean the devil's real
[3:10:33.800 --> 3:10:37.800]  it's a fallen entity on this planet trying to destroy us before we go to the next level and
[3:10:37.800 --> 3:10:41.000]  once you think of it from a science fiction perspective it's like oh that makes perfect
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:45.480]  sense you're thinking this big universe this awesome planet and our awesome species isn't
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:49.960]  going to get fed on and by the way the globalists all believe that they just think they're working
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:55.000]  with the winner they're like hey you're this entity you bet we'll do whatever you say it's on
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:01.720]  satan i am not going to be serving this creature it's real okay it's a freaking space alien man
[3:11:01.720 --> 3:11:09.160]  and it's all right there a fallen creature he can't even get off the planet but he sure knows
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:15.800]  how to screw us up doesn't he it's all right there ladies and gentlemen it's all right there it's all
[3:11:15.800 --> 3:11:24.680]  real all right there's been holding the longest now luke in texas thanks for holding go ahead luke
[3:11:24.680 --> 3:11:33.080]  thank you alex good to talk to you i've been in a listener since i was 11 so about 10 years now
[3:11:33.080 --> 3:11:42.120]  and i just want to start saying your products are amazing thank you i take the iodine fish oil
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:49.640]  krill oil vitamin mineral fusion doesn't get talked about enough just lots of great stuff so
[3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:54.520]  well most supplements weren't really good because supplements are amazing things out of medicine
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:59.880]  chest that god gave us we just go give you the strongest the best uh and you know the whole
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:04.440]  supplement industry has come a long way 30 40 years ago with people like winder and sword
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:08.600]  snagger in my view are you know running some pretty big scams on people with fillers and crap
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:12.520]  but in general supplements and things are really kick-ass nowadays and ours are the very best so
[3:12:12.520 --> 3:12:22.600]  thank you sir yes sir um i just wanted to call in and say um on the topic that i think patriots
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:30.680]  should get out there and do things like katlyn bennett milley weaver does uh oh and your reporter
[3:12:30.680 --> 3:12:36.680]  that's the point with brandon is great on youtube i know you've had him on um oh yeah anybody can
[3:12:36.680 --> 3:12:42.520]  just walk up to a group of leftist and say hey i you know tell me about satan and they'll all tell
[3:12:42.520 --> 3:12:46.600]  you we love satan we love to kill babies i mean anybody can just go show who they are they don't
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:50.680]  want you doing it so you'll probably get banned after a few months but not before you get 15 million
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:56.520]  views just say leftist flip out in the name of the town on the date it'll go viral and then just
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:01.240]  keep exposing what monsters they are the globalists try to hide what their minions are like all day
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:10.280]  long from people yes sir um we just need to get out there be vigilant like you said earlier and
[3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:18.040]  other callers go to washington go to their event go out there and expose their minions like you say
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:23.560]  and uh people will start to wake up and see what's really going on they will the trump needs to have
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:27.560]  the justice department go after these people they know that the indictments are there that's confirmed
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:31.480]  and people people how do you know it's confirmed there's a process and the deputy attorney general
[3:13:31.480 --> 3:13:36.760]  three weeks ago said it goes forward no the indictment stands and that was in the news
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:40.600]  but it hasn't been handed out yet and that's why that you're seeing all this flipping out
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:46.440]  and so i'm just saying we're in the danger zone right now history's happening god bless you
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:51.720]  i appreciate your call sir okay who's been holding the next step for that josh in new york then julie
[3:13:51.720 --> 3:13:58.280]  and then kirby and oh my gosh josh you're on the air go ahead hey alex uh i've been born and raised
[3:13:58.280 --> 3:14:03.800]  here in the belly of the beast over in new york city i'm a hispanic man i was born to be you know
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:08.520]  proud of myself and then thought to be a victim after that first woke up with your work with
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:13.960]  jason bermus and uh loose change 9-11 because people here were really from new york they really
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:18.280]  really were affected by that even to this day and then i uh became a supporter of you uh right after
[3:14:18.280 --> 3:14:23.640]  i realized obama was fake and purchased your stuff uh i have the first bottle survival shield and

[3:20:19.480 --> 3:20:23.160]  into this segment to ask him a question because he's a smart guy best-selling author researcher
[3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:28.120]  one of the top friends researchers out there i wanted to ask him as he joins us from
[3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:32.600]  kingston new york birthplace of the clonal revolution what he would call this period
[3:20:32.600 --> 3:20:36.440]  because rustlin boss saying we've been in a soft civil war i've been saying that for years
[3:20:36.440 --> 3:20:40.920]  trump says they're trying to start a civil war regardless what he did with ukraine there's
[3:20:40.920 --> 3:20:46.680]  nothing there we've got shift putting out fake transcripts but they're moving forward with it
[3:20:46.680 --> 3:20:51.880]  they're moving forward with the articles by thanksgiving and they want him out by the year
[3:20:51.880 --> 3:20:57.800]  because he's going after the deep state in my view and pointing out that china sold his country out
[3:20:58.600 --> 3:21:04.920]  and now we have the former governor of massachusetts saying we need to kill him for treason
[3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:12.200]  you've got just saturday night saturday night live making jokes about killing him
[3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:17.560]  and just gut level and also looking at they're making their move right now and i wanted to
[3:21:17.560 --> 3:21:21.800]  ask y'all salinity who thinks that's right a and b why are they doing it but here's the
[3:21:22.920 --> 3:21:28.440]  clip from saturday night live see the full clip on infowars.com here it is as well because
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:32.760]  when they said trump is getting impeached i immediately thought great trump's fired let's get
[3:21:32.760 --> 3:21:38.600]  drunk but they're like no he's just being impeached but he ain't exactly impeached yet
[3:21:38.600 --> 3:21:42.840]  he's still gonna take another year or so and i'm like well damn that sucks let's get drunk
[3:21:44.120 --> 3:21:48.600]  i mean president is only a four-year job but it feels like it's taking him five years to just fire
[3:21:48.600 --> 3:21:54.120]  his ass it's frustrating you know i bet somebody explained how long impeachment takes to john wilkes
[3:21:54.120 --> 3:21:56.760]  boof and he was like okay well where's he at right now
[3:22:01.720 --> 3:22:06.040]  ladies and gentlemen the corporate media is out of bullets nobody listens to him nobody believes
[3:22:06.040 --> 3:22:11.560]  him antifa is beating up all ladies and you know in the street in the lefts praising it for no reason
[3:22:12.440 --> 3:22:20.040]  it's a collective madness and this existential crisis is only expanding and shift's not gotten
[3:22:20.040 --> 3:22:25.880]  in trouble for putting out fake transcripts where does this end gerald salinity what would you call
[3:22:25.880 --> 3:22:34.760]  this period we're in i call it the decline of uh the empire america i mean we're going down so
[3:22:34.760 --> 3:22:41.240]  quick i mean you put that clown on that that that so-called comic there wasn't a funny line that he
[3:22:41.240 --> 3:22:48.440]  said it was no real laughter coming out of the audience and secondly what do i care what what
[3:22:48.440 --> 3:22:55.960]  clowns in comics have to say and you really nailed it when you said about the mainstream media we're
[3:22:55.960 --> 3:23:02.120]  doing our uh you know the chun's journal now is a weekly and the top story of course is what's
[3:23:02.120 --> 3:23:12.040]  going on with this impeachment and we end the first part of it by saying cnn fox abc nbc
[3:23:13.080 --> 3:23:22.120]  msnbc cbs npr washington post the new york times the wall street journal and the rest of america's
[3:23:22.120 --> 3:23:30.520]  junk news media spewing the party line propaganda for the junk food addicted culture to swallow
[3:23:30.520 --> 3:23:38.680]  that's how stupid you have to be to listen to one word that they're saying if you hooked on junk food
[3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:45.240]  and you can't control your eating habits your mind is gone when you listen to the stupid crap
[3:23:45.240 --> 3:23:52.760]  that they're shoveling down your throat with this when they're calling what's going on with the
[3:23:52.760 --> 3:24:01.320]  impeachment they're calling it a constitutional crisis oh yeah it wasn't a constitutional crisis
[3:24:02.200 --> 3:24:12.040]  that george may rotten hell before he dies bush led us to war based on lies that sundan
[3:24:12.040 --> 3:24:18.200]  who's saying had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-qaeda that's not a constitutional crisis
[3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:26.360]  it's not a constitutional crisis that we got the fbi the cia the nsa homeland security every
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:34.520]  one of these low life quote intelligence people with not an ounce of brains spying on us constantly
[3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:41.720]  listening to every word we say watching everything that we do facial recognition that's not a
[3:24:41.720 --> 3:24:49.880]  constitutional crisis alex jones it is not a constitutional crisis that you do not have
[3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:56.440]  freedom of speech or anybody else that they don't want to listen to that's not a constitutional
[3:24:56.440 --> 3:25:04.040]  crisis ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages tune into the mainstream media the
[3:25:04.040 --> 3:25:13.640]  constitutional crisis is to joe biden's son hunter get fifty thousand dollars a month
[3:25:14.920 --> 3:25:22.280]  and a board of directors or barista energy when the little boy knows nothing about energy
[3:25:23.880 --> 3:25:31.320]  probably never been to the ukraine yet think daddy got on the job oh he just been thrown out of the
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:36.440]  navy for cocaine use and was dishonorably discharged so he was good at starting cocaine
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:44.360]  but again looking at the issue this is a constitutional crisis because trump wants
[3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:50.520]  to find out why they got rid of that guy that was the prosecutor that was looking into this
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:58.440]  and we got people like dingle over there shooting up dingle berry how about that another woman
[3:25:58.440 --> 3:26:06.040]  another person born on third base thought they hit a home run her old man was congressman never
[3:26:06.040 --> 3:26:13.080]  worked a day in his life sucking off the public tip like biden has all his life and they're telling
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:21.320]  me that this is a constitutional crisis one of my six years old yes you are if you listen to the
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:28.040]  mainstream media because this is the crap that they're shoving down our throat the prostitutes
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:34.040]  the media whores that get paid to put out by their washington whores and have you heard the
[3:26:34.040 --> 3:26:39.160]  latest biden is demanding they sent a letter to all the networks saying juliani's a liar
[3:26:39.160 --> 3:26:44.120]  you're not allowed to interview him juliani's a freak too oh i know but i mean imagine them
[3:26:44.120 --> 3:26:49.880]  saying who can go on air and who can i mean that's the level that i can't yeah no of course i can
[3:26:49.880 --> 3:26:54.840]  because they don't have me on the air anymore because they don't like what i have to say when i
[3:26:54.840 --> 3:26:59.640]  disagree them economically politically of course this is so let me ask you this and you're taking
[3:26:59.640 --> 3:27:03.400]  over but i really want to get your take on it i smell they're really going after them they say
[3:27:03.400 --> 3:27:08.040]  they are because they know that their corruption is coming out and i agree they're crazy it's it's
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:15.160]  not going to go well but i just smell big explosions yo you're right it is look this might bring down
[3:27:15.160 --> 3:27:21.480]  trump because they're gonna find other things it'll probably bring down biden too you're probably
[3:27:21.480 --> 3:27:29.160]  setting it up for one of the other freaks to win maybe maybe uh what's her name there um elizabeth
[3:27:29.160 --> 3:27:36.120]  warren's yeah pocahontas and i love these people oh i'm so sorry i said i love the i hate these
[3:27:36.120 --> 3:27:41.400]  people say i'm sorry after they get caught anyway here's the deal with trump it's very simple
[3:27:42.360 --> 3:27:48.040]  he's never been a member he wanted to be he can never be a member of the white shoe boy club
[3:27:48.040 --> 3:27:52.360]  remember he bought maro lago over there because they wouldn't let him into the other club he
[3:27:52.360 --> 3:27:59.400]  wasn't a harvard princeton yell guy he we didn't go to the party he wasn't he's not a member of the
[3:27:59.400 --> 3:28:06.760]  gang and he's taken over the gang you got it so the gang wants to get rid of them that's his
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:12.520]  that's how i look at it now you're right you see what you want he's a maverick who came in
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:15.800]  and isn't running things the way they used to run it and they believe they own this country
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:23.800]  you got it and then look here's my question who's going to be the next jeffrey epstein
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:30.840]  because you're going to see that one happen from this too ed book you know and and by the way i
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:35.000]  agree with you and you're gonna take over right now thank you charleston for being here with us but
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:38.760]  you notice it came out in the news that sure enough because he was been staying at epstein's
[3:28:38.760 --> 3:28:43.320]  house and covering it up the old gates i mean these guys are a bunch of sick freaks and their
[3:28:43.320 --> 3:28:47.400]  whole house of cards is coming down with a ride back with charleston lente trends research stay with

[3:31:00.120 --> 3:31:07.560]  september 2019 is a historical date president trump threw down the gauntlet and said globalism is not
[3:31:07.560 --> 3:31:13.560]  the future of the planet the future does not belong to globalists and then trump went after them
[3:31:13.560 --> 3:31:18.680]  on how the chai cons are stealing our intellectual property dependent on massive market barriers
[3:31:18.680 --> 3:31:24.440]  heavy state subsidies currency manipulation force technology transfers and the theft of
[3:31:24.440 --> 3:31:29.160]  intellectual property it was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling leftist
[3:31:29.160 --> 3:31:34.600]  elite and their censorship and how it must be met head on my administration has made clear
[3:31:34.600 --> 3:31:41.480]  to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech this is amazing find
[3:31:41.480 --> 3:31:49.720]  highlights and trumps entire historic speech at info wars dot com and band dot video and god bless
[3:31:49.720 --> 3:31:55.480]  america thank you very much do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong trying to
[3:31:55.480 --> 3:32:01.480]  fact check the president the deceptive Humpty Dumpty troll known as brian stelter and his little
[3:32:01.480 --> 3:32:07.720]  weasel minion oliver darcy have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and
[3:32:07.720 --> 3:32:12.440]  censor us and of course he famously settled on many others that trump is the info wars president
[3:32:12.440 --> 3:32:18.360]  president trumps furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say
[3:32:18.360 --> 3:32:24.200]  the info wars president and you know what is true our audience of activists our guests our crew
[3:32:24.200 --> 3:32:28.920]  and my drive in your drive has brought trump the white house and other nationalists to power
[3:32:28.920 --> 3:32:33.800]  around the world and now trumps openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and
[3:32:33.800 --> 3:32:39.160]  their unelected anti-human tyrannies so this is a day of great victory and i salute you all but
[3:32:39.160 --> 3:32:44.680]  now in the thick of the fight so info wars store dot com for products you need massive sales now
[3:32:44.680 --> 3:32:49.720]  so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end
[3:32:49.720 --> 3:33:05.640]  until we've defeated them you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:05.640 --> 3:33:25.720]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with gerald solente
[3:33:25.720 --> 3:33:35.880]  hey hey great to be here on the alex jones show yep what a time we're going through over here
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:42.920]  on the impeachment first before i get to that you know alex was talking a lot about the person
[3:33:42.920 --> 3:33:49.640]  on earlier about jesus christ and as i say i'm a warrior for the prince of peace
[3:33:49.640 --> 3:33:58.440]  peace i won't die for war but i'll fight for peace and that's why i launched occupy peace
[3:34:00.040 --> 3:34:07.720]  close those bases overseas bring home the troops secure the homeland put them to work rebuilding
[3:34:07.720 --> 3:34:15.720]  our third world rotted infrastructure wpa program work progress administration in 1930s
[3:34:15.720 --> 3:34:23.480]  bring it into the 21st century troops progress administration will give these troops skills
[3:34:24.680 --> 3:34:32.360]  that we need to build this country that they don't have and we can't find a lot of the contractors
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:39.480]  out there you can't find skill labor will give them skills to rebuild this rotted infrastructure
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:46.680]  you saw the study that just came out the pentagons worried about the high suicide rate that's going
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:55.880]  on of enlisted people not to mention the 22 a day of veterans that are committing suicide
[3:34:57.320 --> 3:35:04.440]  and many of them are probably committing suicide because of the conditions that they're being subjected
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:13.000]  to they're immoral fighting wars in foreign countries that have done nothing to us against
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:21.480]  the constitution and when you take that pledge of allegiance that's what you're fighting for
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:27.640]  the constitution and they have us fighting in nations we have no right being in like syria
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:36.600]  Yemen Iraq Afghanistan Libya Somalia Sudan and on and on
[3:35:38.360 --> 3:35:45.720]  so we talk about Jesus Christ let's remember it's the prince of peace and i'm a warrior for
[3:35:45.720 --> 3:35:52.680]  the prince of peace i'll fight for peace but again i won't die for war and ironically it
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:36:01.880]  was in this transjournal going back to the fall of 2014 i wrote about it right here
[3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:17.240]  yep here we go how many recall that not long after this speech this is a victoria newland
[3:36:17.240 --> 3:36:25.640]  and our assistant secretary of state the husband kagan ahead of that right wing group
[3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:32.520]  secretary of state on the hillary clinton he was the assistant secretary on the hillary clinton
[3:36:33.320 --> 3:36:44.360]  she gave a speech at the national press club about ukraine on one side chevron the other
[3:36:44.360 --> 3:36:52.120]  side exxon mobile number a month later this is what happened
[3:36:54.760 --> 3:37:02.040]  how many recall that not long after her speech vice president joseph biden's boy hunter biden
[3:37:02.920 --> 3:37:08.920]  was appointed to the board of directors of barisma holdings limited that's ukraine's
[3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:17.080]  largest energy company also saddling up on the barisma board was davon archer a business
[3:37:17.080 --> 3:37:25.800]  partner of christopher heins the heins of 57 varieties who is coincidentally the stepson
[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:38.600]  of u.s secretary of state john carrey we have to ask ourselves how low have our moral standard
[3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:48.840]  sunk when did it become routine expected and business as usual that we are led down such
[3:37:48.840 --> 3:37:58.280]  destructive roads with so little accountability and no regard for the history that's so obviously
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:07.320]  and indisputably repeating itself the history repeating itself of course is corruption and war
[3:38:07.320 --> 3:38:13.560]  war the united states launched a coup attempt coup wasn't an attempt
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:22.840]  against the ruling leader that was democratically elected in ukraine janikovic
[3:38:25.720 --> 3:38:33.640]  but those are only details so now we're having wasting our time wasting our money
[3:38:33.640 --> 3:38:43.000]  wasting our energy in an impeachment process that's coming about because
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:55.480]  trump wanted to find out what the dirty deal was that biden's son got to be on the
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:39:06.040]  board of directors of ukraine's largest energy company when the cat never been there before
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:16.600]  and knows nothing about energy that you cannot make this up that's how desperate the demo craps
[3:39:16.600 --> 3:39:23.640]  are and again to me this is a fight between the demo craps and the repulsive kin so i have nothing
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:31.480]  to do with either of them but i am an american and i don't want my energy and resources wasted on that
[3:39:32.280 --> 3:39:38.600]  and by the way the other two elements of occupied peace force congress to vote to go to war which
[3:39:38.600 --> 3:39:44.760]  they have not done since world war two we're made up this stuff that we're given el president el
[3:39:44.760 --> 3:39:51.400]  presidente the power to do what they want and finally to put a referendum on each state ballot
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:55.720]  we will tell congress how to vote because we're the ones that pay for it with our money and our
[3:39:55.720 --> 3:40:03.480]  lives so as i mentioned to alex earlier this is not a constitutional crisis this has nothing to
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:12.920]  do with national security as the demo craps are repeating and the media propagandizes for them
[3:40:14.280 --> 3:40:19.720]  all this has to do with the presidential reality show and who's going to win it in 2020
[3:40:19.720 --> 3:40:23.240]  and they're going to do everything they can to get trump out
[3:40:27.320 --> 3:40:35.400]  and as i said trump is not a member of the white shoe boy gang even though he wanted to join
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:41.400]  he's an outsider and they don't want him there they don't want him there he's not a member of the
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:47.320]  club you know when i was down in dc and i spoke to all these groups i was a chief government affairs
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:55.320]  specialist nice to go to these meetings i never fit in i was never a member of the club they didn't
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:41:03.240]  want me in i'm an outsider and look at the club of freaks that are running and ruining our lives
[3:41:04.200 --> 3:41:09.560]  maybe you look up to nancy polosi i got it little chuckie shill me he's your boy
[3:41:09.560 --> 3:41:16.840]  diane not so feinstein maybe little lindsay graham how about mitch mcconnell
[3:41:18.440 --> 3:41:25.720]  look at the freaks running and ruining our lives how could people tolerate this
[3:41:27.880 --> 3:41:36.520]  but most will he'll tune into the mainstream media you think they're stupid or ready
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:45.800]  stay tuned to the mainstream media listen to what's going on and get dumbed down with their junk news

[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:09.560]  nancy polosi has come out and said that the attorney general bar has to resign because he's
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:15.560]  corrupt that's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state that there
[3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:22.040]  are sealed indictments against mccabe and others already two weeks ago the appeal of the deputy
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:27.960]  attorney general was rejected the appeal was brought to him and it was rejected that means the
[3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:33.160]  indictment is there that's why they're so panicked that's why this impeachment's real of course it's
[3:45:33.160 --> 3:45:37.880]  made up of course it's a fraud but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've

[3:49:43.080 --> 3:49:51.320]  gold took a big hit today poof down to the 1470s mark from the high 1532 little while ago a couple
[3:49:51.320 --> 3:50:00.920]  weeks week or so you know my forecasts i said the low for gold and now that it broke by the way
[3:50:00.920 --> 3:50:08.120]  between below 1480 that's significant that was one of our resistance points you can see it going
[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:18.920]  down to 1450 goes below 1450 we see 1390 around there as being the bottom to the bring down of gold
[3:50:18.920 --> 3:50:26.600]  from there we see it going back up to the 2000 and above mark i'm saying above 2000
[3:50:26.600 --> 3:50:32.040]  there are a lot of people saying in the business 10 000 an ounce 25 000 an ounce
[3:50:33.560 --> 3:50:39.640]  but i'm sticking with where i'm looking at now within the next year or so over 2000
[3:50:41.240 --> 3:50:44.760]  this is very important about the fiscal stimulus going on
[3:50:44.760 --> 3:50:51.400]  is a global slowdown has nothing to do with trade you think india's car sales were down last month
[3:50:51.400 --> 3:50:58.520]  41 because of a trade war they're not in a trade war the people got no dough hey look what's going
[3:50:58.520 --> 3:51:11.960]  over there in indonesia riots on the streets yep take a trip around the world one after another
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:19.720]  look what's going on every day you see more and more people it's going on now again in egypt
[3:51:20.520 --> 3:51:29.160]  yep arab spring 2.0 where are they rising up against about a third of the populations living
[3:51:29.160 --> 3:51:35.400]  in poverty or more than that they're living under the dictatorship rule of el sisi
[3:51:35.400 --> 3:51:43.080]  look what's going on in argentina third unemployment
[3:51:44.200 --> 3:51:46.920]  pay so not worth anything to compare what it used to be
[3:51:48.680 --> 3:51:54.280]  you're about 57 billion dollars in debt by the international mafia an international monetary
[3:51:54.280 --> 3:52:02.200]  fund look what's going on in the uk see the numbers that just came out today economy down
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:10.760]  down might as 0.2 percent to global slowdown is going to go into the greatest depression
[3:52:12.360 --> 3:52:17.880]  very important if this impeachment process continues to escalate which it will
[3:52:18.920 --> 3:52:26.760]  against trump go back to what happened when bill clinton was impeached you saw the equity markets go down
[3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:36.120]  down almost 20 percent and then you know what happened they reversed quickly during the impeachment
[3:52:36.120 --> 3:52:47.240]  process it's different this time this isn't 1998 it's 2019 the markets have been artificially
[3:52:47.240 --> 3:52:58.280]  propped up it weren't artificially propped up when bill clinton was being impeached we have a pe ratio
[3:52:58.280 --> 3:53:06.760]  the solid ones around 16 16 times price earnings we're now 10 points above that above 26
[3:53:09.880 --> 3:53:16.040]  so now when the markets go down because there's more erotic impeachment process which is a waste
[3:53:16.040 --> 3:53:20.680]  of time a waste of energy and is dividing the country even more
[3:53:22.920 --> 3:53:31.160]  when these markets go down they're going to crash out that's right globally
[3:53:33.400 --> 3:53:42.360]  they're playing with fire they're too stupid too arrogant too self-serving to understand that
[3:53:42.360 --> 3:53:48.840]  they're only interested in themselves all what's going on now with this impeachment
[3:53:49.560 --> 3:53:57.240]  is a setup nothing more than the 2020 race of the white house the presidential reality shall
[3:54:00.040 --> 3:54:05.640]  they know trump can't win i mean excuse me they know biden can't win as i've been saying if the
[3:54:05.640 --> 3:54:12.440]  election were held now trump would win they know that biden's going to keep stepping on his tongue
[3:54:13.720 --> 3:54:23.320]  forgetting what he said people are nuts about him again i think it's a setup for one of the other
[3:54:23.320 --> 3:54:31.640]  candidates but the bigger picture is not them and the more people that stay tuned to this
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:38.120]  and waste their time getting involved in it the less they know what's going on in the world
[3:54:38.120 --> 3:54:49.160]  that's going to affect their jobs their businesses their families their lives it won't be the news
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:57.480]  you'll be consumed with this other stuff so what we're recommending is that you stay on top of the
[3:54:57.480 --> 3:55:07.560]  news and ahead of the trends and by watching the mainstream media news you just get dumbed down
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:15.080]  lower and it's going to go much lower than it is now so onto some other things to look about look at
[3:55:15.080 --> 3:55:27.960]  that is also what's going on with the war talk against iran we saw the clown prince of saudi
[3:55:27.960 --> 3:55:39.800]  arabia on 60 minutes this weekend blaming iran for the drone strikes against the saudi oil
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:48.360]  fields and refinery the hoothies are claiming they did it and the american media is saying and
[3:55:48.360 --> 3:55:54.840]  repeating what the washington whormasters are telling him to say that the hoothies don't have
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:56:04.680]  the technology guess what yes they do a new study just came out by barred college about all the
[3:56:04.680 --> 3:56:14.120]  countries that have drones you know how many drones they got out there about 30 000 yeah
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:23.000]  this is new millennium warfare part of it hypersonic weapons imagine imagine
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:31.880]  it you're in new york all of a sudden drones come flying in
[3:56:35.320 --> 3:56:44.680]  thousands of them with chemical weapons with bombs with who knows what you think any
[3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:51.880]  defense is going to stop them that's what the third world war will look like and that's
[3:56:51.880 --> 3:56:57.640]  why we need peace it'll be worse than that if we go to war with iran at the beginning of world war
[3:56:57.640 --> 3:57:06.120]  three and as einstein said i don't know how world war three will be fought but world war four will
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:14.040]  be fought with sticks and stones please help us occupy peace because with peace comes beauty
[3:57:14.040 --> 3:57:22.440]  joy love and liberty you can't create that in a time of fear and terror so do what you can to
