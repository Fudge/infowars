[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, March 25th of the year.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  It's 2021, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  I'm about to show you something shocking from Europe.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  The baby being born wrapped in plastic.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  His mother can't touch it because of COVID fears.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  You know, about 60% of the births now in the U.S. are cesarean.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  They're taking control of human biology,
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  but I've got something even more shocking going on with children
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  in the COVID hysteria next segment.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  And then Max Kaiser joins us with massive Bitcoin news
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  and a bunch of other big guests today.
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.000]  But here is the video.
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  It's posted to band.video.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  If you want to share it, it's also at infowars.com.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  Video, the first child born in the matrix.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  The new virtue signal.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  Wrap a baby in plastic as it flails, reaching out for its mother.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  Put the state of medical tyranny between the mother and its child.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  Complete the takeover of the human race.
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  This is the post-human error.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  Back in the mid-20th century,
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  major universities conducted studies like the Milgram and Stanford studies,
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  where they tested their psychology departments,
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  how far they could push their students to commit crimes
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  as long as authority figures were telling them to do so.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  And they found that in almost every case,
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  90-plus percent of people would follow orders from authority figures
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  to even kill people in order to do so.
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  That's why I parallel what's happening with the whole COVID rollout
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  and the lockdowns and the nonsensical social distancing
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  and the masks that don't work and the lies about the COVID deaths
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  and the vaccine damages as a giant Milgram psychological experiment.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  And that's what we're about to break down today.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  It's in late March 2021,
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  the level of absurdity has reached proportions
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  never before seen in human history.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  And I'm down on my knees again
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  Thank you for the happiness you've made
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  The heartbreaking video you're seeing is a newborn baby in Europe
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  wrapped in plastic to supposedly protect it from its mother
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  so it can't touch its mother.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  Despite the fact that hundreds of studies show
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  it's an initial contact with the mother
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  that activates the life force of the child.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a crime against humanity.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  This is a crime against our own biology.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  This is teaching us that we're dirty and evil and bad,
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  and that humanity is a disease on the planet.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  This is the cult of the global warming eugenicists left.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  The death cult is teaching us that we're evil.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  The death cult is teaching us we're bad.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  It doesn't matter if all the science shows
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  more human contact gives us a better immune system
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  and makes us healthy.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  They're teaching us all to be the boy in the bubble
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  who couldn't be in contact with any germs or he died.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  That's a very, very, very rare genetic disorder.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  But if you're not around other microbes growing up
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  and play around in the dirt when you're a baby
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  and put it in your mouth, you don't develop an immune system
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  and that you need the medical system for the rest of your life
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  to give you constant drugs, constant antibiotics,
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  constant inoculations to just keep you alive.
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  We are witnessing a scientific dictatorship
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  take control of the human family.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  We are witnessing the final revolution.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  The medical system is run by the most ruthless
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  out of control corporations and they're simply testing
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  to see what you will put up with.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  We've already submitted to abuse.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  We've already let them lock up our elders.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  We've already let them give us experimental vaccines.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  We've already let them shut down our schools
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  and seen suicide and drug addiction explode.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  We've already seen children performing band practice
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  in pods out of the body sectors.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  We've already witnessed people wearing large donuts
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  around them so they go into bars and restaurants.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  This is absurdity. That's what cults ask you to do,
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  to do things that are ridiculous,
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  to do things that are against common sense,
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  to prove your submission.
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  Clough Schwab and other globalists admit
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  this is not about COVID.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  It's about teaching you that humans are dirty and bad
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  and we need to be exterminated.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  It's about teaching you that you're obsolete,
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  that you are non-essential.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  I am a human being. I exist.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  Delusions.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  You're witnessing mass mind control.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  We are witnessing the true chicken little scenario
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  where psych warfare chiefs aided by big banks
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  and the corporate media and government
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  and the medical system are literally terrifying the public
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  into total submission.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  and by double-talking agents
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  of the enemy.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  A lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  He's invincible.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  And I understand why people aren't to believe that
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  because this is scary what's going on
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  with the global government and the New World Order.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  Now that people woke up to the fact that that's real,
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  they won't somebody to come save them from.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  My gosh, look it out.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  Prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  and signed that executive order.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  That's just one case of hundreds of things
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  that Trump had reversed and now people are going to feel
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  the sting and the pain,
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  the energy cost, everything else.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  What's really illustrated this is the trial
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  in the Senate where Trump's own lawyers
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  are attacking him and putting him down
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  and saying he lost the election
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  because the fix is in, folks.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  The swamp is deep.
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  Trump's got it, but it's up to us to win it.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  It's Thursday, March 25th.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  The year is 2021.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  We are under
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  the United Nations-directed planetary attack.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  A scientific death cult
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  is taking control of human evolution
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  to build a post-human world.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  They're in the process of conditioning
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  the world population to accept the takeover.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  If we adapt by submitting to it,
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  it will be the end of humanity as we know it.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  In the beginning of a true nightmare era,
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  only imagined in the minds of people like H.P. Lovecraft
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  or the mind of Satan.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  This is going to be a particularly powerful transmission today.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  I've done a lot of preparation, a lot of planets have aligned,
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  a lot of big things are going to be broken here on air.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  First off, Max Kaiser, who I've known for 20 years,
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  I've known Max that long,
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  has been a true trailblazer and he's been proven absolutely right.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  There is a Bitcoin global revolution happening right now
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  with central banks coming out and saying they're launching their own
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  cryptocurrencies and claiming they want to get rid of Bitcoin.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  The fact that they're announcing they want to go after
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  is an attempt to suppress it.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  They're not going to be able to get rid of it.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  Now I am officially getting behind Bitcoin
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  because people have a right to it.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  The globalists are trying to take control of it
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  regardless of its providence and where it came from.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  It is now something that is a people versus the system battle.
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  And we'll lay it all out coming up with Max Kaiser starting in the next segment.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  But they are busy trying to drive it down right now.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  I believe that's the time to buy and for the first time ever,
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  I'm not in stocks, I'm on bonds.
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  I began buying Bitcoin yesterday and I'm going to tell you how I did it
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  and where I did it and a lot of deep research over 10 years
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  and now finally made this move.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  And I do it as something that can protect you,
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  something that is more private,
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  something that is an alternate,
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  something the system doesn't want, not as an investment.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  Though if I would have taken the 10,000 Bitcoin
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  that Max tried to give me at the Bilderberg meeting
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  that we were covering 10 years ago,
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.000]  it would have been worth $600 million as of today.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  So we're going to be laying it all out.
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.000]  The Federal Reserve did say yes,
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  we're coming out with our own cryptocurrency.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  So that tells you this is the future, the planets have aligned.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  That's coming up next segment.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  Then we have Robert Barnes joining us with a lot of big news
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  and analysis on what's coming next
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  and how we fight back against this global's takeover.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  And then Andrew Torbo, who's seen a 600% increase
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  in their traffic and signups at GAB
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  that the left is trying to shut down.
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  He's going to be joining us as well in the third hour,
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  then in the fourth hour.
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  Alex Jones and Jason Jones in studio together.
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  He's got incredible footage of the ongoing martial law in Hawaii
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  and more than choking people out, you name it.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  So he'll be in studio with us coming up.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  I've got a lot of calls about this because it aired on NPR.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  NPR is on over 1,000 radio stations.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  And it was put in a lot of different newspapers around the country.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  And it is NPR is calling for me to be shut down,
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  taken off the air,
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  and it's calling for all of our shopping carts to be shut down.
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  Now, I've told you we've already been under assault behind the scenes.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  I haven't gotten into that
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  because I don't want the enemy to know what to target
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  or what's been effective.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  But when I tell you that your financial support to build up our war chest
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  is beyond critical right now, it is.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  I need everybody to go to infowarstore.com and get a book,
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  get a film, get a t-shirt,
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  and know that you're funding this operation.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  Sign up for auto ship on things you're going to want to reorder,
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  like the supplements,
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  and even when they're sold out,
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  when you're on auto ship,
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  we hold it back for auto ship folks for at least two shipments
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  in case you still want to do it.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  You can cancel any time for free
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  if you still get products that may never be coming back in.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  There's a supply chain breakdowns,
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  and yes, all the major publications
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  of New York Times, Washington Post,
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  most returnals the worst.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  They have all been contacting thousands of people,
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  thousands,
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  and trying to find out where we manufacture,
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  what we do, how to shut us down.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  Tortoise interference,
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  racketeering, criminal activity, par excellence.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  But you can read it in the article.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  Here it is, right here.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Gateway Pundit did a story about it,
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  and nothing against our crew,
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  but it's kind of like we don't cover what's happening to us.
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.000]  We're kind of over ourselves,
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  but sometimes we kind of have to focus a little bit
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  and care about the mothership under attack.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  Taxpayer funded NPR goes after Alex Jones
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  and his last channel of income.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  And that's Jim Hoft over at the Gateway Pundit
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  actually cares about us
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.000]  and more than we care about ourselves.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  And I really appreciate Jim Jones' interest in that,
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  because it is a big deal.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  I'm pretty stoic about all this,
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  but they are demanding
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  that eBay kick off our little account
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  and that Amazon take our account off.
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  Some are saying,
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  well, wait a minute.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  You say Amazon is bad,
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  but you have an account.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  I've had an account on Amazon for 25 years.
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  Some of our accounts got shut down years ago.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  Some of them went dormant.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  If we don't have stuff on Amazon,
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  which I don't promote,
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  then we can't control the Chinese fakes that are on there,
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  and there are fake impoverished products from China
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  that are total crap that they flood it with
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  and I have to have an agreement with Amazon
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  that I'm on there just so I can have control
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  and get rid of the counterfeits.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  And that's really the reason for it.
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  You never hear me say,
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  go buy our products at Amazon.
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  But they have a right to sell stuff.
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  They have a right to a market.
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  I have a right to say,
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  try to keep mom and pop stores open
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  and smaller online retailers open
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  that have your political views and that are under attack.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  But that said, ladies and gentlemen,
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  we have the big mega blowout sale.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  I almost called it,
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  when we were planning to sell last week,
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  the save info wars, get it while you still can sale.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  But I said, you know,
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  I don't want to put blood in the water,
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  even though it's a true statement
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.000]  that we can be shut down anytime
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  if you knew all the stuff that was going on.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  The whole country's being shut down, though.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  My God, they took all the Trump's bank accounts.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  They've kicked all his merchant accounts off.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  He can't sell make America great again hats.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  I was sitting there talking to a very well known individual.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  Didn't even know about this.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  So we've all gotten so punch drunk to being abused.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  And I said, yeah, you know,
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  all these big credit card processors and PayPal
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  banned Trump selling Trump gear.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  The person looked at me and they said, come on, that's not true.
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  PayPal is owned by the famous libertarian individual.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  No, it's not owned by him anymore.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  And I pulled up the article.
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  I talked in PayPal bans Trump merch.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  I mean, that's what's going to go.
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.000]  Oh, well, just get another merchant.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  Then they take that one.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  They take that one.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  So instead of paying 1.9 percent
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  for your credit card processing,
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  we pay like four or 5 percent.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  That's what the harassment does.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  And now it's not enough.
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  They have a huge article and a huge report.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  Alex Jones still sells supplements on Amazon
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  despite bans from other platforms.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  So remember, remember how just three years ago,
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  they were going, oh, there's no such thing as the platforming.
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  That came out in internal documents.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  That's what they called it.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  Now everybody knows that household word, household term.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  They go, Jones is making it up.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  No one's censoring him.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  I could pull the articles up where they said,
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  no one's censoring him.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  And Tim Cook said, I'm not censoring him.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  I'm curating him like in a museum.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  You just don't have your speech.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  You go bankrupt, you live under a bridge.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  But, you know, he lives in his little palace up there
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  and runs death camps in China.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  But it's okay because Tim Cook's gay.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  Remember that.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  So here we go.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  Alex Jones still sells supplements.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  And the whole article says you need to attack Amazon.
[14:17.000 --> 14:25.000]  You need to attack the other sites he's on like eBay.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  And he needs to be taken down.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  They're like, this is outrageous.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  And they go, where are federal regulators?
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  He needs to be arrested.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  You got to go read the article.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  It is incredible.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  By the way, we're showing articles where Apple is lobbying
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  against bills that would just criticize Chinese death camps.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  Death camps where they sell people's organs.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  Men, women, children, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  And NPR loves that.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  Oh, liberal.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  Oh, but Alex Jones questions mass shootings.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  Alex Jones questions Jesse Smollett.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  Alex Jones questions Bubba Wallace.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  And Alex Jones questions babies and incubators
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  that didn't happen to start the Iraq war.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  And they're like, that can't be allowed.
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.000]  He's a mean person.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  He's the worst person.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  I've never killed anybody except the self-defense.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  Well, maybe somebody died later.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  I forgot to follow him with the point is that I didn't start it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  I've never gone out and offensively killed anybody.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  And I have not engaged in all these crimes.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  And I'm not running death camps in China, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  And so that's the issue here is that it's this corrupt,
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  horrible, evil elite establishment lecturing us that Jay Leno's bad
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  because 10 years ago, he went, who cares?
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  I do redneck jokes.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  We should be able to make fun of everybody.
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  You ever watch Japanese TV?
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  You ever watch Chinese TV?
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  All they do is make jokes and make fun of each other.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  And by the way, they make fun of us.
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  Oh, but Jay Leno, he's so sorry now.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  Well, you know what?
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  Fitting all the dragons is funny.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  He's sticking around.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  All right.
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  Max Kaiser and the biggest Bitcoin niche.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  It's all about the way of the human species to mutate us into a form
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  The bottom line is they want to play God.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  They are playing God.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  And the news is only going to tighten around our next from here on out.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  So many other people want to be positive.
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  of what's happening with New World Order.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  But at the end of the day, it's all about the population.
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.000]  It's all about world government.
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  It's all about the end of the human system as we know it.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  It's actually the nightmare being built only admitting it can turn around.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Stop it.
[16:58.000 --> 17:04.000]  Emmerich's Essentials is all natural, all organic, high end, quality, clean,
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  self care products.

[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  That's all of these high end, super pure, quality essential oils
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  in basically every popular sentence out there.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  Then of course we have the natural shampoo, organic.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  We also have the body wash.
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  It's all there.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  And our best selling organic deodorant from Emmerich's Essentials.

[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  It's 50% off as well at infowarstore.com.

[18:21.000 --> 18:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[18:31.000 --> 18:45.000]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  Alright, I've known Max Kaiser.
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  I actually went and looked it up.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  19 years.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  Hell, you can go back to Dateline NBC shows that he's in in the 1980s.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  He was a very successful spot broker.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  One of the most successful out there.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  He's also been on Al Jazeera, BBC, RT, US TV.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  He's been a sought after guest for a long time.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  And 10 years ago, covering Bilderberg, north of London.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  We're in a hotel at night, eating dinner, and he goes,
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  look, Bitcoin's the future.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  In the next 20 years, it will replace the dollar.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  The world currency goes, I think in about 10 years.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  I remember the conversation and he kept saying,
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  let me put this on your computer.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  10,000 of these, but you got a promise to give most of it away to your listeners.
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  By the way, that's what China is doing today.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  They're giving their fake currency.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  They're trying to compete with Bitcoin out to people to get it going.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  And I don't remember what happened.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  People that were there, Richard Reeves remembers it.
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  Others remember it.
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.000]  It went on.
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  I remember most of it.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  I was drinking wine and eating a big old fat steak.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  I've been working probably 15 hours that day.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  I don't remember what happened to the history.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  He doesn't remember whether I got it or not.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  I remember he got mad because I didn't promote it like I said I would.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  But he still came back around.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  He was mad at me for about a year or so.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  But that's okay.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  Boy, I'm mad at me now too.
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  I wish he would have punched me right in the face.
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  But regardless, he was right.
[20:04.000 --> 20:06.000]  I wasn't wrong.
[20:06.000 --> 20:09.000]  I just, I talk about things I know, things that I've educated on,
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  things I understand.
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  I will tell you my view on it.
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  When I don't know something, I have a tendency to not tell you.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  So he came here again two years ago, met with my wife and I,
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  brought Stacy with him, his great lady.
[20:22.000 --> 20:25.000]  And he said, listen, dude, it's going to go up even more than it did
[20:25.000 --> 20:26.000]  in the last 10 years.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  You got to get behind it now.
[20:28.000 --> 20:29.000]  He wasn't telling me anything.
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.000]  He just said, you got to do this yourself.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  And he told me the best, cleanest ways to do it.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  And I signed up and then didn't even do it.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  And boy, did I wish because it's doubled or more since then.
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  That would have funded our whole operation.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  So they may drive it down.
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  They may drive it up.
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.000]  Definitely.
[20:46.000 --> 20:47.000]  It's here to stay.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  So I want to give him the floor for this segment and a few more to get
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  into what's currently happened, the global civil war.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  They've got all these financial experts out.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  Oh, the governments are just going to seize it.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  And outlaw it like gold, you know, like they did in the 30s.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  There's no way to do that.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  But again, they're doing that to drive it down because now we know
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  China and India and the U.S.
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  are coming out with their own crypto currencies.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  And so now it's truly a people's fight.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  Yes, it's speculation.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  It doesn't matter because now I feel gut level good to totally jump
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  in and support it because people have a right to buy and sell and own
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  and trade what they want.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  And it is good to have a backup currency.
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  It's good with all these currencies hyperinflated in my view to diversify.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  And I've been watching them all and got confused by all the fake ones
[21:33.000 --> 21:34.000]  and the bad ones.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  And that kept me from getting into Bitcoin.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  I meant to do it two years ago.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  Didn't do it.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  Now I'm sure about it, whether it goes way down the day.
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  I'm going to buy a bunch goes up.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  Because gut level, now I feel good about it.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  And maybe that works out some of it way in God's plan.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  I just know my gut says something.
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  It's finally green light.
[21:49.000 --> 21:50.000]  It's time to do it.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  And so Max Kaiser, thank you for trying to lead a horse to water
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  and make it drink the last 10 years.
[21:55.000 --> 21:56.000]  Good to have you here.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  Let's get into the current, what's unfolding with Bitcoin and these
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  massive battles and the attempt to drive it down and where you see this thing going.
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  Right.
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  Well, you know, Bitcoin is the apex predator, Alex, in the currency market.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  And it's proven itself to be the apex predator.
[22:14.000 --> 22:20.000]  And it is gobbling market share from all the other fiat currencies.
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  It's even taking market share away from gold, which is really surprising
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  to a lot of people.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  But if you notice gold has been doing nothing for eight or nine months.
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  It's because people are selling their gold and they're buying Bitcoin.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  And for a couple of obvious reasons, first of all, it's unconfiscatable.
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  And what I mean by that is that even though there may be laws passed that say,
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  hey, we're going to go after your Bitcoin, they can pass all the laws that they want,
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  but they can't enforce those laws.
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  As people, the governments have found out in India and countries around the
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  world, they can pass laws against Bitcoin, but they can't enforce those laws.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  And you have to liken it to, if you remember, starting 20 years ago, Alex,
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.000]  there was the PDP file swapping in the music industry and in the intellectual property
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  industry. And of course, Hollywood and the record industry hated the idea of
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  Napster and the follow up to Napster, but they couldn't do anything about it.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  You can't stop the encryption and the PDP file swapping.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  So what happened is the music industry had a completely changed.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  And now we have sites that do music streaming.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  We have sites where you subscribe to music, but the old model of music,
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  the record labels and selling records and the intellectual property, that was
[23:33.000 --> 23:38.000]  completely destroyed by PDP file swapping and nobody could do a thing about it.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  So let's flash forward to Bitcoin.
[23:40.000 --> 23:47.000]  Bitcoin is PDP file swapping equivalent for money and nobody can stop it.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  And they can throw everything that they have at it, but they won't stop it.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  And the users now, the adoption rate is exploding.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  You've got over a hundred million people using it every day as money.
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  You've got entire countries like Nigeria adopting it as day to day money.
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  It's becoming the unit of account in Nigeria.
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  You've got countries that are plagued with hyperinflation like Venezuela, Iran,
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  Argentina and other countries.
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  This is really a way for people to get around the IMF and World Bank slavery
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  that they put in the third world from these jackals, these economic hitmen.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  Yep, absolutely.
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  In particular in Africa now, you know, Africa has been the colonial victim
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  of colonialization for hundreds of years.
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.000]  They're finally breaking free of the colonial mindset of their masters
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  that have been plaguing that continent for hundreds of years.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  And actually the global model, explain that briefly as you're an economist.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  How the French Empire, the British Empire and others used debt
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  to control third world countries and still do.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  Well, it's not too hard really.
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  And if you read John Perkins book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman,
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  he goes into it in great detail.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  You know, the US or the IMF or the World Bank shows up
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  and they make multi-hundred billion dollar loans to countries.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  So much so that they know that they can't possibly be paid back
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  and when those loans can't be paid back, then they send in the economic hitmen
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  and they start grabbing assets.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  They start seizing assets and they essentially control that country.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  And that's been America's model in Latin America and South America for decades.
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.000]  It's also American model in Middle East and in other locations.
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  So it's using debt as a weapon.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  The US dollar has been weaponized.
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  And when America first put that first round of sanctions against Iran,
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  a lot of smart people said, well, that's okay, they can do that,
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  but they should be wary now because you can only do that once.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  Once you weaponize SWIFT, the global payment system,
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  and once you weaponize the dollar, you're encouraging these countries
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  and these territories and regions to develop their own payment systems.
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  So what's happened is now you've got five or six competing payment systems to SWIFT
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  and you've got Bitcoin and Bitcoin is the vector out.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  Christine Lagarde of the ECB recently called Bitcoin the escape hatch.
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  She literally called it an escape hatch from fiat money tyranny is what she was alluding to.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  Stay right there.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.000]  Exactly right there.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  And that's again the head of the International Monetary Fund.
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  We're going to come right back and discuss all of this with Max Kaiser on the other side
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  and see what he sees happening to major currencies,
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  what he sees with the Federal Reserve announcing they're going to have a cryptocurrency.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  China's already launched theirs.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  And so much more.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  And again, the apex predator, Bitcoin undoubtedly will be right back on the other side
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  to lay out all the big global developments as well.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  Whether you're into Bitcoin or not, all this affects you.
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  The global currencies are being inflated massively.
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.000]  They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  It is the Patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[27:38.000 --> 27:45.000]  That I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation for purpose of evasion.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  So help me God.
[27:52.000 --> 28:02.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[28:13.000 --> 28:19.000]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[28:19.000 --> 28:26.000]  At the same time, go to infowarsstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt,
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  I need your help more than ever now.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.000]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarsstore.com.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul,
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  Thank you so much.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  Why do you do that?
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types,
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  Boom, we did it.
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  It's popular.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  It's X3.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  Is it better than X2?
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  You decide.
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid,
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  and that is down and out.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  at M4store.com and free shipping.
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the M4 at the same time.

[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  Brainforce Plus, by the way, one of my all time favorite products.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  I completely owe my ability to do this job.
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  I owe my ability to have graduated college four or five years ago.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  I owe it completely to Brainforce Plus, one of the most powerful nutraceuticals you will find.
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  I put it right up there with Turboforce.
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.000]  I love Turboforce.
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  It's great, but when you don't have time or you don't have the wherewithal to drink a bottle of water,
[30:21.000 --> 30:27.000]  take two capsules of Brainforce Plus and you will launch into the stratosphere.
[30:27.000 --> 30:28.000]  You will go to the moon.
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  You will not know where all your energy came from, and then you'll remember, but there's no crash.
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  That's the important part about Brainforce Plus is there's no crash.
[30:36.000 --> 30:42.000]  It's not like drinking three cups of coffee to get that same amount of buzz because you don't come crashing down.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  You also don't get the jitters, at least I don't.
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.000]  You don't get the anxiety.
[30:45.000 --> 30:50.000]  You don't get all of the things that usually come with drinking coffee or energy drinks.
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  Brainforce Plus, clean, natural energy.
[30:53.000 --> 31:20.000]  And right now, it's on sale 50% off InfowordStore.com.
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.000]  It's a great time of changes here.
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  Welcome back to the Galaxy Home Show.
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  The private central banks of the world owned by less than 10 families are predatory.
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  They launch the fake lock-downs to consolidate and vertically integrate wealth and starve the third world
[31:34.000 --> 31:40.000]  while flooding the first world with cheap labor to drive down wages and complete their economic takeover.
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.000]  And those very same central banks have been bashing Bitcoin while setting up their own cryptocurrencies.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  Here's some of the headlines.
[31:46.000 --> 31:52.000]  Bitcoin soars after Musk says Tesla now accepting payment in Bitcoin.
[31:52.000 --> 31:56.000]  Veteran Investor says governments are planning to totally outlaw Bitcoin.
[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  That's what's driving it down today, an opportunity to buy.
[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  That's all being done, again, to scare people away from it.
[32:02.000 --> 32:08.000]  That's Powell at the Federal Reserve says Federal Reserve is considering proprietary cryptocurrency.
[32:08.000 --> 32:09.000]  Here it is at Business Insider.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  The Federal Reserve is looking at developing a digital currency in the U.S.
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.000]  Powell confirms.
[32:13.000 --> 32:18.000]  That's Powell tied to having vaccines and political correctness.
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.000]  That's why we've got to have alternatives and make sure the alternatives survive.
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  I'm for 100 digital currencies out there or cryptocurrencies,
[32:24.000 --> 32:29.000]  but Bitcoin is the one I've studied the most, the one I'm finally going to get into.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  Veteran Investor says governments are planning, again, the same thing I read,
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  Federal Reserve digital dollar push worries Wall Street.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  China has given away millions in its digital yawn trials.
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.000]  This is how it works.
[32:41.000 --> 32:42.000]  CNBC.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  Central Bank digital currency.
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  India to propose cryptocurrency ban penalizing miners, traders,
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  source.
[32:53.000 --> 32:54.000]  Good luck.
[32:54.000 --> 32:55.000]  Bitcoin could be banned by government.
[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  It says world's biggest hedge fund owner as they try to drive it down.
[32:58.000 --> 32:59.000]  This is all planned.
[32:59.000 --> 33:03.000]  China proposes global rules for central bank digital currency.
[33:03.000 --> 33:04.000]  So there's some of the background.
[33:04.000 --> 33:09.000]  All I'm saying is people better learn about this and people better start studying it
[33:09.000 --> 33:15.000]  and people better not procrastinate and stick their toe at least in the water like I've done.
[33:15.000 --> 33:16.000]  But I had to learn.
[33:16.000 --> 33:17.000]  I had to study.
[33:17.000 --> 33:20.000]  I had to see the best places to do it, the safest places to do it.
[33:20.000 --> 33:21.000]  So your wallet doesn't get stolen.
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  So you can keep your passcode.
[33:23.000 --> 33:26.000]  Show that when people get into this, it's a safe and good way to do it.
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  And let's go ahead and talk about that.
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  We'll get into the history of this, where you see it going, how you see this unfolding.
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  Because we talked quite a bit yesterday off air and you were on fire, Max.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  In fact, let's get into that right now.
[33:37.000 --> 33:43.000]  Explaining the global civil war, the fight that you expect the U.S. Treasury later to actually adopt Bitcoin.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  And you've been dead on for 10 years on this.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  So look into that crystal ball and tell us what you see happening next.
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  Right.
[33:50.000 --> 33:51.000]  Yeah, I'll get to that.
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  You know, what I call the hash wars or the Sputnik moment.
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.000]  And that's very dramatic.
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  It's going to probably happen in the next 12 months or so.
[33:59.000 --> 34:05.000]  But to just look at Bitcoin again, what it has that is unique is that it's completely decentralized.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  What that means is that there's no center to attack.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  And that's one reason why it doesn't matter who passes one law to try to stop it.
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  There's no place that they can attack.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  It's decentralized.
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  It's replicated on thousands of servers all over the world.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  And you can't go after them all.
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.000]  And again, to use that P2P file swapping analogy, it's just uncensorable.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  It's immutable.
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.000]  And the central banks, of course, are quite nervous because a lot of capital is moving out of the central banks
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  and moving into Bitcoin.
[34:36.000 --> 34:44.000]  And so if you defund the central banks and you defund Wall Street, that's a problem for the central banks.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  And they're getting nervous.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  So in response, they're going to launch a central bank digital currency.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  But by definition, it can't work because by definition, it's centralized.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  And so therefore it cannot compete with a decentralized, unconfiscatable Bitcoin.
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  So it's not going to work.
[35:00.000 --> 35:07.000]  The same thing applies to these so-called altcoins like Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Satoshi Vision.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  They're either insecure or they're centralized or they have a single point of failure.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  And that's why they're all really disappearing versus Bitcoin.
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  If you look at how Bitcoin has been performing in the last five years, it's really putting everything out in its shadow.
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  And I think that's very important to understand because a lot of people get caught up in these what are called the garbage coins
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  and they end up wasting time, they end up wasting money in these garbage coins and they lose out on Bitcoin.
[35:32.000 --> 35:42.000]  So that's great that the Bitcoin maximalism philosophy, if you will, is really what I think info wars needs to focus on.
[35:42.000 --> 35:49.000]  Now, in terms of the global hash war, the flip side of all this talk about banning Bitcoin from governments is that
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  the governments are going to realize that they can't beat Bitcoin.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  They're going to have to join Bitcoin.
[35:54.000 --> 36:01.000]  And I liken it to the Sputnik moment going back to the Cold War when the Soviet Union put up the Sputnik satellite
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  and suddenly America felt like they needed to enter the space race to compete.
[36:06.000 --> 36:15.000]  And with Bitcoin, when you have countries around the world that are defying the sanctions from the U.S.
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  and we're talking about Iran and Venezuela and other countries, what they're doing is they're actually mining Bitcoin and hoarding Bitcoin.
[36:22.000 --> 36:32.000]  And if the U.S. doesn't decide to counter their moves by mining and storing Bitcoin themselves and they risk having a country like Iran
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  have the strongest currency in the world.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  If Iran went to 100% Bitcoin standard, it would immediately have the strongest currency in the world.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  So the U.S., of course, would be, wait a minute, we can't let that happen.
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.000]  So then they're going to get into mining Bitcoin and storing Bitcoin.
[36:47.000 --> 36:56.000]  And I predict that within two years, America's IRS will let taxpayers in America pay their taxes in Bitcoin
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  and get an 80% or 90% discount on their taxes.
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  That's how desperate America will be for Bitcoin.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  So it's a mad scramble for Bitcoin.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  And it's not about banning it.
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.000]  That's a fool's errand.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.000]  It's impossible.
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  And it's counterintuitive and counterintelligent.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  And it's a strategic blunder.
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.000]  It's a matter of national security, Alex, if you're a country and you don't have any Bitcoin on your balance sheet,
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  you are taking a huge risk in a world that's on a Bitcoin standard.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  So that's what we're going to see in the next year or two.
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  And it's a learning curve.
[37:29.000 --> 37:36.000]  I mean, obviously the Federal Reserve and Chairman Powell and over there at the Treasury,
[37:36.000 --> 37:46.000]  they are still thinking in the old legacy terms, they haven't really figured out yet that Bitcoin is going to do what it's going to do regardless of what they do.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  But they'll come around, hopefully.
[37:48.000 --> 37:49.000]  Absolutely.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  So let me throw this in because you're the guru of this, probably the top Bitcoin guy out there.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  Certainly the first person I ever heard articulated properly and you've been dead on.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  You worked with me for years.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  You told me the best cleanest place to sign up.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  I signed up two years ago, but never launched it because I was so busy.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  Now I have relaunched it as of last night.
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  And I'm already seeing some traction there.
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  I'm about to make a 10% investment of our meager treasury into Bitcoin.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  And I think now is the time to get in because if I look at these graphs of the last 10 years, put it back on screen for TV viewers, please.
[38:21.000 --> 38:28.000]  You see this slow buildup and then a big spike and then a few spikes and then it goes down, but then always rebounds two or three times bigger later.
[38:28.000 --> 38:34.000]  And so we just seen this giant spike. Is that one of the baby spikes before the top, before it starts going back down again?
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  Or with your expertise, again, I know it's just speculation.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  What do you expect to see with this market?
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.000]  Well, for 2021, my price target is still $220,000 per coin.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  So between here and there, you're going to have some volatility.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  But with Bitcoin, you're making a trade off.
[38:54.000 --> 39:01.000]  You told me two years ago it would hit $50,000 within a year to two years. You were absolutely right.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  And it's $60,000 plus.
[39:03.000 --> 39:14.000]  You only have to ask yourself one question. Do you want to own fiat money like the US dollar, which is completely stable and you're guaranteed to lose 15% a year in purchasing power?
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  Or would you rather own Bitcoin, which is volatile, but you're guaranteed to increase your purchasing power every year?
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  Let me ask you this question. They have a lot of these questions. There's only 21 million Bitcoins. They've mined 18 million or whatever.
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  What's the issue there? Will there be another issuance or what happens?
[39:31.000 --> 39:41.000]  No, there's 2.1 quadrillion, what are called Satoshis. That's the division of a Bitcoin that's visible into 100 million sub-Bitcoin, which are called Satoshis.
[39:41.000 --> 39:50.000]  There's 2.1 quadrillion of them. And just like any market, as demand increases, the price goes up and we trade in Satoshis.
[39:50.000 --> 40:02.000]  So when you are on a site that, for example, Adam Curry has a new site, which is all about streaming these Satoshis for podcasting.
[40:02.000 --> 40:12.000]  It's a brand new model. Adam Curry, the podfather, he's reinvented podcasting using Bitcoin Satoshis and you stream into your wallet as you do your podcast.
[40:12.000 --> 40:20.000]  I want to mimic that. A necessity is the mother of invention. It's incredible. You told me all this years ago to do it.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  And now I'm a daily dollar short, but I'm definitely going to get involved because regardless of what goes up or goes down, it's time to get educated.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  It's time to get informed. This is the future. It's where it's all going.
[40:28.000 --> 40:34.000]  It's written about in the Bible, so we at least should know what's happening and be wise and informed because the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  We need the knowledge. And we have a big announcement. I haven't made yet.
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.000]  When we come back with the one, the only Max Kaiser, I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com and news wars.com.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  Believe me, you're going to want to stay with us for the announcement on the other side.
[40:48.000 --> 40:57.000]  Please stay with us until your friends and family tune in right now.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  Alex Jones here with the new info or sale, and it is a fantastic sale.
[41:01.000 --> 41:10.000]  It is many of our best selling products that just so happened to also be selling out. But despite that, they're 50% off and free shipping on these select items.
[41:10.000 --> 41:18.000]  Again, all of these are selling out except for Rainforest. It finally came back into stock. It's amazing. It's 50% off and free shipping.
[41:18.000 --> 41:30.000]  We've got the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the Kaba Chill, the Vaso Beats, the Alfa Power, all of these are best sellers, 50% off and free shipping at infowarsstore.com
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, and it funds our operation.
[41:34.000 --> 41:41.000]  Plus all of the emergency essentials, essential oils, natural deodorants, shampoos, conditioners, a whole host of products.
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  The entire emergency essentials line is close to selling out and we're coming in a few months.
[41:45.000 --> 41:51.000]  But despite that, right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're all 50% off as well with free shipping.
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.000]  Just follow the banners at infowarsstore.com to huge savings and it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  Gerald of South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air. It's trying to move quicker.
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  Hey, Alex. Welcome.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[42:09.000 --> 42:16.000]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[42:29.000 --> 42:37.000]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  And that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  Randy Dewright. Randy Dewright, thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  Challenge, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.000]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[43:36.000 --> 43:42.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time,
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.000]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know.
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[43:52.000 --> 43:57.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment.
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[44:07.000 --> 44:13.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the chai comms especially,
[44:13.000 --> 44:21.000]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[44:25.000 --> 44:32.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  In their own words, they admit it.
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.000]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket-pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages.
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great.
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  when you are traveling and don't want a big brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.
[44:55.000 --> 45:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  Digital cryptocurrency. I'm watching all these other governments move to do it.
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  And then I'm seeing the globalists saying, you shouldn't own Bitcoin.
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  Well, you have a right to own it.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  And again, I don't buy something when it's at its high. I don't buy something when it's at its low.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  I never get involved in any of this stuff. I just study it.
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  But in the future, everything will be these digital currencies and people,
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.000]  especially conservatives and Christians, you can start understanding it even though it's full of pitfalls and crazy.
[45:51.000 --> 45:57.000]  Clearly the apex predator is Bitcoin. Max Geiser told me that five years ago he was right then he was right.
[45:57.000 --> 46:02.000]  Two years ago when he came to visit me, I'll invite him here now with Stacy to be in studio because I'm all in.
[46:02.000 --> 46:07.000]  If I would have invested in Bitcoin two years ago when he said, don't be an idiot.
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  It wasn't messing with him. He just said, you need to do this.
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  This is he told me some of the safer places to do it.
[46:12.000 --> 46:18.000]  I would have been able to put $100,000 in and gotten you know, $500,000.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  It could have helped us fund this whole operation. But regardless, it's good to just study it.
[46:22.000 --> 46:28.000]  So go ahead and make the announcement. The same thing you did to me two years ago.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  Explain it to folks and we're going to put it on screen.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  One of the best places, one of the only places to do it safe, do it right.
[46:34.000 --> 46:42.000]  And again, then that actually funds info wars because we get a little tiny one quarter of one percent.
[46:42.000 --> 46:49.000]  You want to add a bunch of fees on when people set up their account, when people get their $10 free Bitcoin converted.
[46:49.000 --> 46:56.000]  And it's just really a great deal and it teaches people how to get involved and you know, put in a few hundred bucks, put in a few thousand bucks.
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  Don't put anything in that you can't lose.
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.000]  But again, in my view, you're going to lose if you don't start getting educated about it.
[47:02.000 --> 47:09.000]  So that's what I'm doing now. And I do intend and I've already started to put some of our funds in there because I really do believe in this.
[47:09.000 --> 47:13.000]  And it's really time for me to stop missing the boat here.
[47:13.000 --> 47:20.000]  So explain to people the place to get involved in Bitcoin, the URL and the place to help info wars at the same time.
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  A true 360 win Max Kaiser.
[47:23.000 --> 47:32.000]  Sure. As I said a couple of years ago, and it's true today, swanbitcoin.com is the best place to buy Bitcoin.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  And there's a few reasons for that.
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.000]  Number one, it's super easy. Number two, you get the best rate. Number three, they don't support any of the garbage coins.
[47:41.000 --> 47:48.000]  So when you go to some of the places to support info wars, it's swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  The best deals they've got are right there free to sign up.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  You get $10 of free Bitcoin to be able to play with it, study it, learn with it.
[47:56.000 --> 48:06.000]  So again, put it back on screen folks, it's swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex.
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  Please continue Max.
[48:07.000 --> 48:15.000]  Right. So it's super easy to deal with them to have a very great feature called dollar cost averaging.
[48:15.000 --> 48:24.000]  And you can set it so that every day or every week or every month, you automatically buy $10 or $50 or $100 in Bitcoin.
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.000]  So it's just set it and forget it. This way, you're always going to be stacking sats. It is called stacking Satoshi's.
[48:30.000 --> 48:36.000]  You're always saving, you're always putting some capital into Bitcoin on a regular basis.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  You don't forget to do it. It's just done for you. You can quit that at any time if you want to.
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  But it's a very easy way to just accumulate Bitcoin automatically.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  And it's all up to you when and how much.
[48:47.000 --> 48:54.000]  And as I said before, the folks at swanbitcoin are OGs as they're called in the space.
[48:54.000 --> 49:01.000]  They've been around since the beginning. They understand the importance of Bitcoin and there's no garbage coins.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  There's no Ethereum. There's no Bitcoin cash. There's none of that garbage.
[49:04.000 --> 49:11.000]  They just deal with the apex predator, the one, the only, the one that's going to take out the central bankers and that is Bitcoin.
[49:11.000 --> 49:17.000]  So with swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex, you know, that's great for you guys.
[49:17.000 --> 49:26.000]  You know, it's a great promo. Your listeners get 10 bucks free in Bitcoin when they sign up using that promo code.
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  And also, I mean, at the end of the day, it's just a very simple product.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  You just have to make the mental commitment to say, you know what, I'm tired of fiat money.
[49:36.000 --> 49:44.000]  I'm tired of all the money printing. I'm tired of the, the fact that nobody in Washington represents my interest at all.
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  The all they do is throw cash at the bankers. They destroy my purchasing power.
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.000]  They, they're, they're killing my businesses. They're, it's, it's a travesty.
[49:53.000 --> 50:00.000]  So this, this is the passive resistance. This is the fight back. This is how you opt out of the lunacy.
[50:00.000 --> 50:08.000]  And at some point you got to stick your toe in here. I've waited 10 years. And again, it's because I didn't want to tell listeners what I thought until I was really sure of it.
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  People are big kids, big adults. They can make their own decisions. We're all big boys here.
[50:12.000 --> 50:19.000]  But man, if I'd have got it in December, you know, it's gone up 100% just then or no, it was 9,000.
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  It's gone up. It's gone up 9,000 to 60,000. I mean, how big of an increase is that?
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  It's just crazy. And of course, there's been so much volatility, but just answer my question here though.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  I understand they've got the little subdivisions of it and it's dominant and it's the apex predator.
[50:33.000 --> 50:39.000]  It's the first and it, it's the biggest. But how does that not hurt it when, when the other three million are mined?
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  But that's such a big part of the driving dynamic of it. And that's what's so organic about it.
[50:44.000 --> 50:53.000]  Because the mining schedule is set up so that it's gradual over the remaining 100 years, right?
[50:53.000 --> 50:59.000]  So we won't have the last Bitcoin won't be mined until 100 years from now. The year, well, 2140.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  But every 10 minutes, some Bitcoin are mined and they enter the system.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  It's that's the monetary policy. If you will, the Bitcoin is gradual happens every 10 minutes.
[51:07.000 --> 51:13.000]  A few coins are released into the system. And then every four years that the amount of coins that are released are cut in half.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  We just had that.
[51:14.000 --> 51:25.000]  You just answered that. I mean, did like a genius space alien come up with this because compared to the Rothschilds having, you know, 10 pounds and then loaning out 100 pounds with paper.
[51:25.000 --> 51:31.000]  That's just a simple scam. I mean, this is so sophisticated. It was the first. It's still the best. It's the biggest.
[51:31.000 --> 51:37.000]  It's bigger than anything out there now. It's totally insane. I mean, come on. Who really came up with this?
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  I don't just think it was. I mean, Japanese are super smart. But I mean, one Japanese dude.
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  I mean, how did you know so early what was going to happen, Max?
[51:44.000 --> 51:50.000]  Well, the history really have to go back 20 years before Bitcoin was launched in 2009.
[51:50.000 --> 51:56.000]  The cipher punks as they were called have been trying to come up with money that you could use on the Internet for decades.
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  And in the white paper, there's a reference to Adam Beck and he's got he had a system called hash cash.
[52:03.000 --> 52:07.000]  And that was one of many systems that were attempted before Bitcoin.
[52:07.000 --> 52:14.000]  And so finally, the programmer who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto figured out the final piece to the puzzle to make
[52:14.000 --> 52:20.000]  uncompensatable, immutable money possible on the Internet and he released in 2009.
[52:20.000 --> 52:28.000]  And the reason he's anonymous is because he knew based on the experience of anyone who's ever tried to do any competing monetary system.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  They put you in prison or kill you. They put you in prison or kill you.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  They get into trouble. Yeah, they get into trouble very quickly.
[52:33.000 --> 52:42.000]  So he made the strategic decision to essentially become anonymous and just fade away from from reality, you know, fade away from the scene.
[52:42.000 --> 52:48.000]  Because obviously what you see now with central banks are getting absolutely crazy.
[52:48.000 --> 52:57.000]  They realize that their time is growing short and they would love to be able to find the person who created it to attack them and to smear them
[52:57.000 --> 53:03.000]  and to publicly pillory them the way they do to everybody they don't want to get airtime.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  They would de-censor that they they would de-platform them.
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  But because there's nobody to attack, it's beautiful because there's nothing that they can do.
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  I totally agree. It's so beautiful. It's so well done and you have been so dead on.
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  Why did you know this was the one when it happened?
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  I mean, you're a really smart guy. You've got great instincts, but how did you know?
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  Well, in the 90s I have a patent on a digital currency that I invented.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  I mean, you should always promote the Hollywood Stock Exchange when you came on. You talked about it. Yeah.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  Yeah. Yeah. So that has a patented virtual currency.
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  Didn't the Pentagon steal your idea or something?
[53:36.000 --> 53:43.000]  No, we sold it to Cantor Fitzgerald and they moved the entire thing to the top of the World Trade Center just three months before 9-11.
[53:43.000 --> 53:48.000]  So 9-11 came and literally the whole thing got destroyed.
[53:48.000 --> 53:57.000]  But the technology at that time was a digital currency you could use online, but it was highly centralized.
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.000]  So the key about Bitcoin is that it's de-centralized.
[54:01.000 --> 54:07.000]  It manages to have all the attributes of hard money and immutable money,
[54:07.000 --> 54:12.000]  but by also being simultaneously de-centralized without having a center to attack.
[54:12.000 --> 54:19.000]  Even gold is problematic because even though gold's around the world and you can find it around the world, it's easy to confiscate gold.
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  As we've known from history, gold is complicated.
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  There's a good luck stopping Bitcoin, absolutely.
[54:23.000 --> 54:31.000]  All right. Well, everybody needs to go to Swan, one word, Swan, S-W-A-N, bitcoin.com, slash Alex.
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  And you get the very best deals they've got. They've got a lot of great services there. It's free.
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  You sign up for free. And then if you want to buy Bitcoin, you buy it there.
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  And I've talked to a lot of other people, not just Max Kylez. They go, yeah, this is the place to do it.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  This is how to do it. Folks, there are so many scams out there.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  People say, oh, send me your Bitcoin. I'll give you double.
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  No, no, no. Deal with swanbitcoin.com, forward slash Alex.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  And then a very small percent goes to us.
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  But Max projected this two years ago, and he was right.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  If we'd have done it, it would have fixed all our problems.
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  We could have already launched a bunch of new initiatives against the globalist, but I'm just such a traditionalist.
[55:07.000 --> 55:14.000]  I'm not a traveler. I use new technology, but I just, you know, I just have been too skittish about this.
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  And again, nothing's perfect. It may go way down. It may go way up.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  I'm going to buy it. And I hope it keeps going back up.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  But I'm not worried about that because the system is scared. They don't like it.
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  We're going to break. Do five more minutes with us.
[55:27.000 --> 55:33.000]  Max Kaiser is here with us today, and I really appreciate him guruing me through this for 10 years.
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  And I don't want to say I feel foolish. I just feel like I just, I feel like this is surreal.
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  I mean, he literally tried to get me to take 10,000 Bitcoin and I was too stupid to even do it.
[55:42.000 --> 56:04.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[56:13.000 --> 56:20.000]  And of course, we have the natural shampoo organic. We also have the body wash.
[56:20.000 --> 56:30.000]  It's all there and our best selling organic deodorant from enrich essentials 50% off and free shipping part of our big blowout sale.
[56:30.000 --> 56:36.000]  That's taking place right now. We also have brain force plus new tropic back in stock.
[56:36.000 --> 56:48.000]  It's 50% off as well at infowarstore.com. 50% off and free shipping right now at infowarstore.com on these select items.
[56:48.000 --> 56:56.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[56:56.000 --> 57:05.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[57:05.000 --> 57:13.000]  Recent studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[57:13.000 --> 57:22.000]  decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[57:22.000 --> 57:33.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[57:33.000 --> 57:41.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[57:41.000 --> 58:08.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[58:12.000 --> 58:21.000]  Well, all right, we got five minutes left with Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com has got a lot of their websites.
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  What is the best place for people to find everything Max Kaiser?
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.000]  Twitter, you know, that's easy, Twitter, Max Kaiser is my Twitter handle.
[58:30.000 --> 58:37.000]  Wow, so you bet on this over 10 years ago you've been dead on there's Max Kaiser at Max Kaiser.
[58:37.000 --> 58:42.000]  And what in the last five minutes we have other great knowledge would you like to impart to us?
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  Oh, great orange one.
[58:44.000 --> 58:53.000]  Well, as Stacy just pointed out, I tell you, if people really want to dive into the rabbit hole and learn more about Bitcoin,
[58:53.000 --> 58:59.000]  there's a great resource and you can find it at bitcoin.page.
[58:59.000 --> 59:07.000]  And it's all free and it's a repository of the best articles ever written about Bitcoin for the past 10 years.
[59:07.000 --> 59:15.000]  And it's put together by our friend, Jameson Lopp, who's one of the absolute stalwarts of the whole Bitcoin.
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.000]  And it's a free resource, bitcoin.page, P-A-G-E.
[59:19.000 --> 59:26.000]  And it just says, you spend a few hours reading those articles and I guarantee you, you will start shaking with excitement
[59:26.000 --> 59:33.000]  because you realize that this, in fact, is the answer we've all been waiting for for decades, pushing back against the globalist,
[59:33.000 --> 59:37.000]  pushing back against the central bankers, pushing back against fiat money.
[59:37.000 --> 59:45.000]  This is the answer and you can just go to there and absorb all that information and you will become a Bitcoin maximalist.
[59:45.000 --> 59:51.000]  Stay away from the garbage coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash and Satoshi Vision, those are all garbage.
[59:51.000 --> 59:57.000]  I mean, if you go to the local check cashing places and even payday loan places, they have Bitcoin.
[59:57.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  I mean, it's been adopted and I agree with you.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  I don't see how they were even able to compensate the gold when they tried.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  There's no way they're going to be successful in banning this.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  And what is it like?
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  It's like 95% of the cryptocurrency market's Bitcoin.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  I mean, it's not the APEC predator, it is the environment.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Right, 95% of all the computational power in the entire industry goes to Bitcoin.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  And that's growing every day and it's going global.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  People like Fidelity Investments, which is a multi-trillion dollar asset company are launching a Bitcoin fund.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  BlackRock is launching a Bitcoin fund.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Elon Musk is totally in.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Right now.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  Elon's in.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  What's that?
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Elon's totally in.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Elon is buying it.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  You've got Michael Saylor over at MicroStrategy.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  He's buying billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  Paul Tudor Jones, one of the most famous money managers in history, started buying Bitcoin last year.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  So actually right now at $50,000 a coin, the risk reward here is pretty good because you're front-running,
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  what's called front-running, you're getting in before the trillion-dollar investment funds,
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  the sovereign wealth funds come in and they're all going to come in.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  And that's why I think we're going to get the $220,000 in 2021.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  Man, you've not been wrong yet when it comes to Bitcoin.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  And you were right that shorting silver could hurt the globalists, but then they came in and naked shorted it.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  But you've definitely been a trailblazer.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  A minute and a half left.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  What other great nuggets do you want to give us?
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Well, ask me anything.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  I mean, you're now a Bitcoiner.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  So what's that, Stacy?
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Oh yeah, we've got the Orange Pill podcast on YouTube.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  So it's youtube.com forward slash orange pill.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  So we've got a live stream there once a week.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  We've got our podcast there on Sundays.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  That's a great podcast.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  And by the way, you've had me on your RT show a lot too.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Let me just tell you this.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  You see the CEO of YouTube said no people are allowed to interview Alex Jones.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  He just can't have his own show.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  So I would love to come on your Bitcoin podcast with my questions.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  I'd love to come on and ask you questions.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  That sounds groovy, man.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  You know, we'd love to come back to Austin feast on the barbecue that we love.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  My house brother, I got a nice spare room.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Listen, I'm excited though.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  I'm all in now.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  You've tried for 10 years.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  You wanted to get me in bed now.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  We're, I mean, not to be caring.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  You know what I mean?
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  I mean, I am literally in league with you now to feel good or more like, yeah, idiot.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Glad you finally woke up.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  Eventually everyone comes into Bitcoin and they get the price they deserve.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  All right.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Well, hey, you got it for coming on every week and you got a good Stacy on the show too.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Absolutely.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Alex, you know, we've been hanging out for nearly 20 years, keeping it real.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  And, you know, the fight continues.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  And I think Bitcoin is the kryptonite to their very limp sausages.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  You know, we're going to win this.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  Beautifully said.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  All right.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Predator.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  Max Geyser.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  Thank you.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  America is about to have its energy cut off.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Its borders destroyed.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  It's dollar brought down to nothing.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  The enemy can't help itself.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  We should.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  But once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  You're going under judgment just like all the children that were aborted.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  This is the truth.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  This is the Infowar.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Coming up in a few minutes, constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is going to join us to
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  cover the waterfront.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  It's a big lawsuit.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  He's about to launch his ideas on how to battle the globalist, the internal fights, the human
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  traveling at the border, Bitcoin, global currencies.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  We're going to cover it all with him coming up.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  And of course, he always talks about this.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  I'm not a litigious person, but we did threaten us through the Wall Street Journal when they
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  said I led the attack on the Capitol and they did retract.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  But look at this.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Taxpayer fund and NPR goes after Alex Jones and his last channel of income.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  That's not actually completely true, but they're being nice to get away from it.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  But yeah, they want our Amazon account.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  They'll go, oh, you credit us Amazon.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  What are you doing there?
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  If I don't have an Amazon account, I can't take the counterfeits of our products off.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  You don't hear me promoting the Amazon account, do you?
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  But I mean, for a lot of small businesses, Amazon is great.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  I'm just saying when you only buy stuff from Amazon, it has a monopoly practice.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  That's a real problem.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  And Jeff Bezos promotes leftist garbage.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  That's a real problem.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  But he's not as bad as some of them.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  I mean, we're still there.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  But they say, oh, we're organizing everyone to take him off there and he's got an account
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  on eBay, which we sell a little bit of stuff on too.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  So it's crazy, ladies and gentlemen, when I get up here and I explain to you that, and
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  I haven't talked about this yet because talking about it encourages them and it gives them
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  an effective and the rest of it.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  But at the same time, I want to communicate with you what's going on.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  And I'm a tough guy.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  In fact, I can be totally exhausted if somebody death threats me or something bad happens and
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  somebody has all this energy to fight it.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  But let me just tell you, it's totally criminal and I've gone through one one hundredth what
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  Trump has gone through.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  So that's why I do admire Trump even though he wasn't perfect because I know his whole
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  family and like seven rings out from him have gone through.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  They've had the Wall Street Journal is the worst.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  And others pull it for prize winners, which means for fraud.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  It's like you won a peace prize now for launching wars like Obama.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  It's an award you don't want.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  It's like getting something from Hitler literally calling thousands of people total.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  I mean, people don't even know we're calling.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  I get dozens of calls a day.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Everyone's being called that has any connection to us just to see if someone will make something
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  up.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  And they say, where does he make the supplements?
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  What are the companies?
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  Because they want to call up and basically bomb threat those places.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  I mean, they don't do it.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  They publish it in the Wall Street Journal on NPR and they say, do something.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  And then the left is literally bomb threat people.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  And they'll find out who the owner of a company's wife is and call up her business and the
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  left goes, oh, you make supplements for all of Jones.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  You're fired.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  So this is a Nazi reign of terror going on.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  And we told Trump three years ago about and you let us get the platform, you'll be the
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  platform.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  And Trump's saying, if you let them take the banking away, if you let this racketeering
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  go on, if you let them take the production away, they'll do it to everybody.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Which notice, the great reset, the big lockdown is for all the small businesses.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  You're non-essential.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  I'm just being attacked because I'm standing in the way of them and you.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  I affiliate myself with you.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  I don't affiliate myself and feel like I'm part of the globalist establishment, though
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  they begged me to join them.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  I mean, I've probably had 20 meetings with globalist over the years off record and signed
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  non-disclosures.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Signed one just days ago in Connecticut.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  But Rothkoff, the head of the Kissinger Group, in front of John Harmon on the phone during
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  breaks, said, join us.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  You are already a super class.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  There's only 1,000 of us.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  You will control the liberty movement.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  Come to New York now.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  You'll make hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  I said, I'm not joining you.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  He said, I just can't believe it.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  No one doesn't join us.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  You just, you're a fool.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  I can say that because he did it.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  I had this other globalist threaten me in an LA bathroom at a film production set.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  And because he did it in front of witnesses, I can tell the story.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Threaten to sue me.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I said, go ahead.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  But my point is, ladies and gentlemen, is we're in the heart of the fight, ladies and
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  gentlemen.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  So don't take it for granted that we'll be here tomorrow.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  Don't take it for granted that Band-Aid video will be there.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Share this info and say, this is the forbidden info.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  This is the takeover of America.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  This is the group fighting it.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  So Barnes, you've got a lot to cover.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  I wanted you to get you on last week.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  You were too busy in court and stuff.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  But about a host of issues.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  I can't remember why I wanted you on last week.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Now, so much has happened.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  But can you spend a few minutes with your great historical and also legal mind on what is
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  racketeering the right term?
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  I mean, what is this where big corporations gang up, steal data, reverse engineer stuff
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  they've gotten from the government, put it out and then have hordes of people harass you?
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  I mean, this is what they claimed McCarthy did, but he didn't do it at one one hundredth
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  mile.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  What would you call this witch hunt, this terrorism, this un-American orgy of evil that just keeps
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  getting worse and worse and worse and no one resist it?
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  I mean, my God, where does it lead next is the real question.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Robert Barnes, thanks for joining us.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Oh yeah, glad to be here.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  It's sort of a reverse McCarthyism.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  And it was whatever people think about what McCarthy himself did and whether that label
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  is correct for his name to be attached to it.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  What it described was this kind of blacklisting mindset.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  But this goes far beyond that.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  I mean, you look at what happened with McCarthyism and what mostly was the House on American
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Activities Committee and that included a lot of prominent Democrats, those run by Democrats,
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  did and the reason why they stuck McCarthy's name on it because he was the only Republican
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  that was associated in the Senate and he was nowhere near involved with who acted, who
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  acted is what did all of the most problematic actions.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  But they mostly put pressure on media academia on Hollywood to conform and to blacklist a
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  certain individuals.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  But many of those individuals, they did not unleash lawfare against them.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  And it's just that their political tool set continues to expand so that what was just
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  public humiliation and public censorship campaigns, public embarrassment campaigns,
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  employment blacklisting campaigns have now reached a whole new level of personal
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  lawfare campaigns depriving people of their occupational and professional licenses.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  I look at what happened in Michigan.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  It was someone who says, hey, I'm not going to be the guardian of the healthcare for people.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  I'm going to let people make their own decisions.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  And I don't think the governor, the governor who was busy being a serial killer and whacking
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  old people all across the state.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  I'm not going to defer to that person for how I run and operate my business or to dictate
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  to the people who choose to patronize my business.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  And what did they do?
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  They started out with removing the business license so that she couldn't even operate
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  the business when she continued to do so.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Then they used the basis that they had removed her license to wage lawfare against her.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  And when that didn't satisfy them, they used jail and put her in jail simply for wanting
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  to operate her business that people wanted to go see voluntarily and consensually.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  And while Target and Walmart and the grocery stores are all open, your little business is
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  not essential.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Little people are the most essential.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  This is such an authoritarian move, all couched in love.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Well, it's just rising levels of weaponization.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  Everything that they can weaponize, they're weaponizing, whether it's media access, legal
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  access, professional access, occupational access, a ballot access, it doesn't matter
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  what it is, they're weaponizing every tool in their toolkit to maximize true totalitarian
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  political control to a degree that really the only regimes that ever came close to this
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  were the Inquisition Era Catholic Church regimes and the Communist regimes under the Soviet
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Union.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  That's right.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  I mean, when you say true totalitarianism, there's never been an animal like this.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  I mean, if this was a race car driver, it'd be Mario Andretti or it would be Dale Earnhardt.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  I mean, it'd be Muhammad Ali boxing.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  I mean, this is the greatest tyranny and it's just getting started.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And it admits it wants to imprison us and kill us.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  I mean, the left has now become an army of evil.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  No doubt about it.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  And their willingness to plagiarize as part of this process is incredible.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  You see the evidence coming out of what the Capitol Hill cases where they try to tar and
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  feather all oathkeepers with certain criminal activities.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  And now it's coming out.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  They're having to beg for trial continuances because the evidence does it turns out that
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  most of the prosecutors were lying the whole time that in fact, the text didn't say what
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  they said it did.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  There was no conspiracy.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  There was no that's what I wanted you on last week exactly what how big is it the U.S. attorney
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  went on 60 minutes and we know it's all in court sedition.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  We know Trump run it.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  I mean, you have to throw all those cases out now under law because he just said we're
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  demanding our investigators find this.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  Exactly.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  I mean, that prosecutor did what was something that was highly unethical.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  It was ultimately embarrassing to the Biden administration because it exposed what the
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  real objective was.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Now, part of that is on Trump.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  Senator got into it while under Trump, so this is where some of his appointments were
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  not ideal, but putting that aside, what he exposed was how politically weaponized this
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  whole case was that they were deliberately manipulating bail proceedings and those criminal
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  cases to terrorize and intimidate people from lawful protesting in the future.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  They basically had to fabricate evidence and arguments because the real evidence doesn't
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  support the claims they're making.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  All right, well, let's talk about we can talk about all the stuff that's happened, but you're
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  coming next, so let's extrapolate in this insane thing.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  The wheels are off by and he's falling down.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Doesn't know where he is.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  Kamala's cackling like a witch, flying around the broom almost.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  I mean, the black smoke coming out.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  What happens next with Robert Barnes?
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  It's very bittersweet.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  I care about beating the new world border.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  They can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.

[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  When the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.

[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  All right, Robert Barnes is our guest.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and he was a constitutional lawyer.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Somebody who knows the grindstone.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  It's here to the ground.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  Laying out the example of the judicial tyranny we're seeing with the old man.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  People that were just there being indicted.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  We expect this to lead to insurrection and terrorism charges, says the U.S. Attorney,
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  telling his investigators what to find for folks that aren't lawyers or aren't prosecutors
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  or aren't defense attorneys.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  That's like one of the cardinal big no-nos, isn't it, Barnes?
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  That's why they're asking for continuances now while they keep people locked up in prison for doing 1-1 million to what BLM and Antifa does.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  What you're supposed to do in any criminal prosecution, but especially a federal criminal prosecution with political overtones and undercurrents,
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  is investigate the case first before you indict people.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  Here what they did is they indicted people first and then went and looked for evidence.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  The second problem of this, of course, is speedy trial violations.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  The third problem with all of it, of course, is the bail violation.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  They're locking up people that have been charged with nothing more than misdemeanors.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  Like in the Oath Keepers case, they were claiming that there are conspiracies to commit violence and all these preordained theories.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Then the actual evidence starts to come out and there's no evidence for that.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  There's no evidence that any of them committed any violence at all.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  If they're being charged with violence that somebody else committed that's not associated with them, that happened separate from them,
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  that was even before they got there, that just involves property.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  Under that theory, they could have indicted everybody connected to BLM over the summer.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  They could have indicted everybody connected to Antifa over the summer.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  There would have been some media people indicted as part of that process and yet most of those people weren't indicted that actually committed the violence itself.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  Including physically attacking people in burning buildings. In fact, the media praised the burning buildings and said,
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  what did Cuomo say? He said, who says demonstrations have to be peaceful?
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Exactly. So the degree of duplicity and hypocrisy, they clearly wanted this to be much worse than it was.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  They wanted to be able to attribute this to something like Oklahoma City.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  And instead it didn't in 1995. They instead didn't get anything close to that.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  They mostly got just grandma's wandering around that thought it was okay and just ordinary everyday people who just showed up and saw.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  Maybe 20 people assaulted cops and took crabs and that's fine. They get a vandalism assault charge, not not tradition and terrorism charges.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  Exactly. I mean, you look at what's happening in Portland, people who committed violence daily against the courthouse, daily against the federal marshals, daily against.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  They just did it again, burning the courthouse and attack it with people in it. But the media is like, well, that's okay.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  Not only that, most of the charges were dropped as soon as Biden got in. Everybody who committed routine, regular, everyday violence,
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  that here you have just a few number of people commit violent acts against property or people.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  And of course.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  Few people caught up in the moment hysteria, not long term actors that live in encampments funded by George Soros,
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  and nightly go out and beat people up and burn things and shoot police. No, no, those organized marauders are protected and bailed out of jail.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  Ultimately didn't find any weapons on any of these people as they admitted in the congressional hearings.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  So these are people who clearly, you know, there was no pre-planning of any type other than maybe some people who had some bad intentions.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  And we already know there were informants that had infiltrated the organization.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  We already know there are people that are ultimately paid by CNN that were there.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  So the idea that this just didn't meet the institutional narrative, so they have to gaslight the world and pretend that it does.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  Let me ask you this in big terms.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  Seeing the wheels come off, maybe disagree with what they have, and seeing Biden falling down, seeing him not knowing where he is in every speech,
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Kamala, super impu- Where is this going? Okay, you stole the election.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  Now you're in there and they stole it with these uncharismatic dead fish.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  So extrapolate that out. Where do you see this going? What are the different scenarios here?
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Well, it's a sign of a declining empire is what it is.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  I mean, that's why China felt such confidence to come to America and smack America's Secretary of State rhetorically in the face repeatedly.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  This is why, you know, Putin can make easy jokes.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  He's like, you know, I wish Joe Biden good health.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  But if he really wants a discussion, I'll debate him anytime he wants live.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  And of course, Joe is busy tripping to hide in that context.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  When you have an old decrepit dementia candidate who can't walk upstairs without tripping three different times,
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  who has to hide out in the basement of the White House, just like he did throughout his campaign.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  I mean, once it hits one o'clock, he disappears from press coverage of public disclosures holding his first press conference today.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  It appears that's going to be with like four people or tomorrow.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  And so this is a sign of a declining empire, the deep state, the part of the deep state that wanted the America to be the beginnings
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  and the continuance of a sort of empire driven global globalist set of policies has failed.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  And increasingly, the whole rest of the world recognizes it.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  The only question is how long before America?
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  This is key.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  Pax Americana was sold as we set up a world government, America runs it.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  But the whole time was meant to get rid of America.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  And now they've got the mask and the social distancing and the sign of a cult and decline wanting to see us submit to them under a hoax.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  That's a sign of their weakness.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  And now even the establishment sees, oh, we've lost all our power.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  We should have had Trump rallying to hold us up in our worst hour.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  But we got threatened by that because we'd invested in China.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  But now they don't need us because they know we're a bunch of little bitches.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  Completely. And what we have is a bunch of generation of people who grew up watching, you know, that TV show West Wing who live in their own little in bubbled spaces.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  You could tell Blinken was completely unprepared for the utter humiliation he was going to suffer.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  He couldn't believe it.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  He couldn't believe that weakness, especially to the Asian culture, they're like, we're groveling.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  We sold out to you.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Why are you pissing on me?
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  Because they see it as weak because you are weak because a real leader wouldn't act like that.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  They were scared of Trump, you dumbass.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  You never bow before a king.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  You bow before a king and the king is going to, especially an abusive king, you're just going to get smacked in the face and they're going to walk all over you.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  And that's the nature of it.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  And they respected Trump because Trump, one, didn't play stupid politics.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  He defended American national interests.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  They respect people who, and they respected Trump's negotiation abilities, is willing to back things up, is willing to take action, is willing to defend America.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  And these are people who think that the rest of the world wants them to be the leaders of this building line.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  I totally agree.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  You're dead on.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  So what happens as the left reaches the point of realizing they're pathetic losers and their war against America's strength is a war against themselves?
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  If they hijack the damn ship, why are they running it off the freaking reef?
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Well, that's the dangerous sign.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  When you have people that are this incompetent, that are this incapable of evaluating the world, when they get scared, when they get frightened, what do they usually do?
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  They usually find some war to justify themselves in.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  And now they're even dumber, they want a domestic civil war to cover up their mistakes.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  The worst possible war.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Well, it appears at times they almost want both.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  I mean, you look at hotspots in Bolivia, Venezuela, Ethiopia, but especially Ukraine, where they're encouraging the Ukrainian government to basically storm militarily the eastern part of the country that is really aligned with Russia.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  They're inviting a war.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  And what happens if Russia gets involved?
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  And then we get involved.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  We have a live hot war for the first time since 1945.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  And we're going to have pregnant women in the airplanes and dudes in red high heels.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  I mean, it's a total joke.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  Barnes, I want to hit this more.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  What else?
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Because I got a lot of questions, but what do you want to hit when we come back?
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  Sure, a bunch of things.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  I think the other thing is the whole crazy modern monetary theory that the Fed and Biden, he's almost spending another $4 trillion.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  That's 20% of the size of the entire GDP of the United States after he just spent $2 trillion.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  So, I mean, there's just print, print, print, print, print.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  And one of the things that I'm going to be part of is we've got to find ways to find out what's really happening behind closed doors at the Fed to audit the Fed.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  So I'm going to join an effort to sue the Fed as part of auditing the Fed.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  And we can talk about that and all the other insanity economically.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  That's right.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  We have nothing left to lose.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  So why not stand up?
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Robert Barnes, straight ahead.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  You heard him about to announce he's suing the Federal Reserve.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Newswars.com and Bandai Video.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  Proud to be number one on the enemy yet list.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  It's been officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030 gets here.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  And it only gets worse like being fed into a woodchipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle to the first civil and stopping abortion.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  We must start doubting human life again.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  Look, I've proven that info wars information is some of the best in the world.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  It's just absolutely on target.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F Kennedy was right.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  Our raising tide raises all ships.

[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  People ask me all the time, they go,
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Joe, are you on cocaine or are you on meth?
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  How are you so excited?
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  Force masks, force inoculations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  I'm a fighter.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  And so I'll just say this.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  I try to be calm.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  I try to be focused.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  I don't know what I do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air because you have to realize when I tell you that you're the info war,
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  that's not me patting on the head, you are 99% of the equation.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products,
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  infowarstore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  So you are the info war.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Thank you for all you've done.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalist.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  Because we are effective, the great awakening is here.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I am not a Gonzo journalist, I didn't set out to write myself in the stories.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  We're just in most of the major stories where the resistance, the globalists hate us,
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  they don't understand that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction,
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Newtonian physics, so that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger, Nietzsche was certainly correct.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  I had Roger Stone on yesterday and I know Roger Stone well, I've only made years on him well about six years.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  And I know he had a big nice house, I know he held us money, I know what lawyers cost, I know he went almost bankrupt.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  So he wouldn't come to DC, I knew people wanted him to go speak at DC, so I helped him out with $10,000.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  So he could get his, him and his crew up there, because I get money in here to fund things.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  I'm not like some, you know, big rich person or something, but I mean, there's a lot of groups, a lot of organizations,
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  I've funded over the years and they could help.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  I mean, it's just what I do.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  Big news stories and media matters, oh, and in arrest Alex Jones, he funded Roger Stone to go to Washington protest,
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  financed the flights.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  Yeah, that's Newsweek saying, and it's like, oh, prosecutors, we found this secret thing.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  It was like when I said the day of the riot, a million people there, 200,000 capital,
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  maybe 100 or 200 go inside, maybe 20 bad things.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  I'm like, yeah, I financed the first $100,000, got donors for the $500,000 for the stage.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  Trump doesn't get that from the government, the RNC wouldn't pay for it.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  You think I was proud of that?
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  I was saying Trump's in trouble, no one will even fund his event.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  I'm having to do it.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  I said that weeks before the event, I said support us, we may be on the line for $500,000.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  But thank God the money came into reimburses, I don't have $500,000 laying around.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  That means no bonuses for the next year for my crew, and I don't get paid.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  I mean, I don't have that much money.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  I'm working with a few million dollars a year extra just for these projects.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  And that's what's so frustrating is I've got the point where I can't help all these people.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  I used to help quietly because I'm not about the credit.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  I want to beat these monsters.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  And I've been pushed to the edge of a cliff and to watch them viciously.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  When I'm on air saying, Roger, I know you can't afford security.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  We tried to help you, and I had to help you get up there.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  And I know for a fact it was a little bit of a cracker box apartment.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  I might put it down.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  But I've been there.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  I mean, it's not for the things they want to put me in that position, which is fine.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  They can kill me.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  I'm not going to stop.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  But now media matters says, Jones needs to be indicted.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  He admits to flying Roger there to run the attack.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  Roger didn't even go to the damn speech.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  You know why?
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  Because there was a million people there and we couldn't get to the crowds.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  I could barely get to the crowd.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  It took me an hour and a half to get through the crowd to the entrance where they had it
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  walled off for Trump's speech, a limited fence around him.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  And again, I'm not up here going, oh, I'm innocent.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  Please don't get me.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  The left are disgusting people.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  They literally know we didn't do this.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  They know it blew up in our face.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  They know they had provocateurs in there.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  They know they dressed up like manga people.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  They bragged about it in Time Magazine.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  And then they turned it around and say, I don't mean to rant.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  I got you here, Barnes.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  They have you talking.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  I apologize.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  Get into that if you want and then just get into your great insight on the empire.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  Oh, I know why I did this rant.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  I forgot why I was going down that road.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  This is not for the FBI.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  This is not for anybody to leave me alone.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  This is the reality.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  The last thing I want is violence.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  I've always been like that.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  The pen is my ear and the sword.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  90% of war is information.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  I'm in full wars.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  I do stuff with information.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  Information is power.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:03.000]  So the idea to frame me and millions of other Trump supporters as wanting a revolution,
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  that's the left.
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  Our ideas sell.
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  People came to America because of the idea of freedom.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  We're not selling communism, Barnes.
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  So I'm whanting here, but how do you extrapolate that?
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  And what do you make of this frothing intent to try to get us indicted?
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  Well, there's no doubt that what they originally wanted was to use the events of January 6th
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  to get Trump in trouble, get all the Trump administration in trouble, and as key supporters
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  in trouble.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  The problem was the evidence refuted their claims that with the evidence dug in, Trump
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  had knew nothing about it.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  Trump actually wanted National Guard there.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  It was other people who prevented it.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  It's Nancy Pelosi who's probably more responsible than any other public official because she's
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  the one that effectively issued de facto stand-down orders by not having the staffing and the security
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  present even after it was requested on multiple occasions.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  And notice when Lindsey Graham said that, they dropped the fake impeachment.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  When he said, what did Pelosi know?
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  When did she know it?
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Exactly.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  The moment they said they wanted to put her on the stand, they wanted to depose her, they
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  wanted to have her have to testify, all of a sudden they're like, we don't want any more
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  evidence here.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  Let's move on real quickly.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:15.500]  And they know that what you did was one of the, you were one of the key reasons why things
[1:34:15.500 --> 1:34:22.000]  did not go in a much worse direction on January 6th because you were there on multiple times
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:27.960]  at multiple places, on video, on audio, getting people pulled back that didn't know what was
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:32.800]  happening to stay away, to not go into the Capitol, to not do anything illicit.
[1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:36.500]  You were there on tape, on record, on video, advising the security.
[1:34:36.500 --> 1:34:37.500]  Oh yeah.
[1:34:37.500 --> 1:34:39.500]  We turned back the main crowd that thought the Capitol was just open.
[1:34:39.500 --> 1:34:40.500]  I said, no, don't go in.
[1:34:40.500 --> 1:34:41.500]  And they, I said, tell everybody.
[1:34:41.500 --> 1:34:44.000]  And they told everybody because they couldn't hear me throwing a yard's head.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  I said, tell the next person, don't go in.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  It's a trap.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  It's a trap.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  And they, they did that.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  Everybody turned away.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  That was good.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Yeah.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  And you approached the Capitol Police.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Well, I'll be honest.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.500]  It was the, it was the former Army Special Operations guys that was with, they said, they said, we
[1:34:58.500 --> 1:34:59.500]  got to race the Capitol.
[1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:00.500]  They breached the Capitol.
[1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:01.500]  You got to try to stop this.
[1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:03.000]  And I was going to try to stop it anyway.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:07.500]  But we, we ran the last quarter mile, my fat ass, just like trying to get them turned
[1:35:07.500 --> 1:35:08.500]  around.
[1:35:08.500 --> 1:35:09.500]  Oh, exactly.
[1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:11.780]  And it was your people uptelling the Capitol Police.
[1:35:11.780 --> 1:35:16.540]  You were there to use your, uh, megaphones to get anybody and everybody out, to get
[1:35:16.540 --> 1:35:20.980]  anybody and everybody away, to get anybody and everybody to step down and stand down.
[1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:25.140]  And they, it was the Capitol Police chose not to utilize that, but you were there throughout
[1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:26.140]  the process.
[1:35:26.140 --> 1:35:27.140]  Yeah.
[1:35:27.140 --> 1:35:28.140]  I asked for control of the PA system.
[1:35:28.140 --> 1:35:29.140]  I said, why aren't you using your PA?
[1:35:29.140 --> 1:35:31.980]  We'll see you days later to say Marshall Law, no one allowed around here.
[1:35:31.980 --> 1:35:34.020]  And they have speakers, every hundreds of speakers.
[1:35:34.020 --> 1:35:37.660]  I said, well, you get on them then and tell them, get out when people here, get out of
[1:35:37.660 --> 1:35:39.060]  the Capitol, get out of the Capitol.
[1:35:39.060 --> 1:35:40.060]  They would have left.
[1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:41.060]  Oh, exactly.
[1:35:41.060 --> 1:35:44.980]  And I, and you have to wonder what some of those people were told.
[1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:49.340]  It was clearly the case that some people within the Capitol Police apparatus were told different
[1:35:49.340 --> 1:35:55.300]  information than what was later relayed because almost if proper security is there, then this
[1:35:55.300 --> 1:35:56.780]  never happens.
[1:35:56.780 --> 1:35:59.020]  That's the biggest story of January 6th.
[1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:05.100]  They want to manufacture this fake insurrection that never happened, this fake sedition conspiracy
[1:36:05.100 --> 1:36:06.380]  that never happened.
[1:36:06.380 --> 1:36:13.340]  They created the opportunity for a very small, tiny group of people to do bad, amongst which
[1:36:13.340 --> 1:36:20.460]  were CNN, ultimately paid by CNN, and Tifa supporters, included in which were FBI informants
[1:36:20.460 --> 1:36:21.960]  and infiltrators.
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:24.340]  So we already know some of that.
[1:36:24.340 --> 1:36:28.500]  But in order for that to happen at all, met the police needed to, Capitol Police needed
[1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:33.300]  to be told not to do their job, met the National Guard needed to not be there, Secret Service
[1:36:33.300 --> 1:36:34.740]  to not be there.
[1:36:34.740 --> 1:36:38.060]  And again, Trump was scheduled to speak right behind the Capitol.
[1:36:38.060 --> 1:36:40.740]  Why wasn't the Secret Service scoping it out?
[1:36:40.740 --> 1:36:41.740]  Somebody got...
[1:36:41.740 --> 1:36:42.740]  Well, there was a total standout.
[1:36:42.740 --> 1:36:45.580]  We got there because that's why I said, go to the other side before we have the stage.
[1:36:45.580 --> 1:36:47.300]  It was there the day before we had the permit.
[1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:49.420]  It was all gone when we got there.
[1:36:49.420 --> 1:36:50.420]  Total setup.
[1:36:50.420 --> 1:36:53.660]  A complete total setup all the way through.
[1:36:53.660 --> 1:36:57.580]  So the, and that's why I don't think they can afford real evidence to be developed.
[1:36:57.580 --> 1:37:01.260]  They want a railroad, they, the most of the people they've targeted are poor and working
[1:37:01.260 --> 1:37:06.380]  class people who again, many of them didn't need, some of the people, they're like targeting
[1:37:06.380 --> 1:37:11.460]  disabled combat heroes with no criminal record who literally are like half dead.
[1:37:11.460 --> 1:37:15.340]  They're just, they're target people who can't fight.
[1:37:15.340 --> 1:37:18.820]  It's politicized prosecution all the way.
[1:37:18.820 --> 1:37:22.820]  And it's what exposes how corrupt the seventh floor of the FBI is, how corrupt parts of
[1:37:22.820 --> 1:37:27.500]  the Justice Department are, how corrupt key parts of our national security apparatus is.
[1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:31.340]  You know, they, they try to mean, and so they're, the media is going to keep trying to do the
[1:37:31.340 --> 1:37:36.260]  libel campaign against you and against Trump supporters and against Trump and against oath
[1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:40.860]  keepers and others because they needed this narrative to be something that it wasn't.
[1:37:40.860 --> 1:37:44.500]  And so they're going to keep pretending that it's something that it wasn't and hope they
[1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.820]  don't get sued somewhere along the way.
[1:37:46.820 --> 1:37:48.340]  I mean, that's, that's what's going on.
[1:37:48.340 --> 1:37:50.340]  It's gaslighting extraordinaire.
[1:37:50.340 --> 1:37:52.900]  That's a big myth that most people, they've done the polling.
[1:37:52.900 --> 1:37:53.900]  Most people don't buy it.
[1:37:53.900 --> 1:37:57.660]  80% of the people are like, this was not that big of an event.
[1:37:57.660 --> 1:37:59.660]  Especially compared to what happened all summer long.
[1:37:59.660 --> 1:38:02.780]  We had all swaths of places burned.
[1:38:02.780 --> 1:38:06.780]  Dozens of police killed, dozens of citizens shot dead and the media had great discipline.
[1:38:06.780 --> 1:38:08.300]  They would shut it all down.
[1:38:08.300 --> 1:38:12.740]  Just like they said, this crazy Islamist that killed 10 white people was a white dude killing,
[1:38:12.740 --> 1:38:15.180]  killing, killing, killing minorities.
[1:38:15.180 --> 1:38:16.980]  Obama said that.
[1:38:16.980 --> 1:38:21.380]  Well, especially when you have something like that sociopath in Atlanta who clearly
[1:38:21.380 --> 1:38:24.060]  is driven by his own mental illnesses.
[1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:28.340]  And they try to pretend that it has something to do with the race of the people that some
[1:38:28.340 --> 1:38:29.340]  of the people that he killed.
[1:38:29.340 --> 1:38:34.860]  He was a mentally ill in cell, pissed he was blown his paycheck on sex workers.
[1:38:34.860 --> 1:38:38.220]  And what they're not talking about is how that sex work comes about in the first place
[1:38:38.220 --> 1:38:42.740]  is sex trafficking by triads connected to the CCP and China.
[1:38:42.740 --> 1:38:43.740]  That's the topic.
[1:38:43.740 --> 1:38:44.740]  Let's talk about that next.
[1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:45.740]  Barnes is always on fire.
[1:38:45.740 --> 1:38:46.740]  By the way, Barnes, come back tomorrow if you want.
[1:38:46.740 --> 1:38:47.740]  We have one more segment.
[1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:50.540]  I'm doing a special Saturday, three hour commercial free show.
[1:38:50.540 --> 1:38:51.540]  You want to come on for an hour?
[1:38:51.540 --> 1:38:52.540]  We love it.
[1:38:52.540 --> 1:38:53.540]  Let's go viral.
[1:38:53.540 --> 1:38:54.540]  I don't know why.
[1:38:54.540 --> 1:39:01.420]  It's essential is all natural, all organic, high end, quality, clean self care products.

[1:39:20.980 --> 1:39:21.980]  sentence out there.

[1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:26.980]  We also have the body wash.
[1:39:26.980 --> 1:39:27.980]  It's all there.
[1:39:27.980 --> 1:39:35.540]  And our best selling organic deodorant from Enricks Essentials, 50% off and free shipping
[1:39:35.540 --> 1:39:38.780]  part of our big flow out sale that's taking place right now.

[1:39:46.020 --> 1:39:53.860]  50% off and free shipping right now at infowarstore.com on these select items.
[1:39:53.860 --> 1:40:00.820]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[1:40:00.820 --> 1:40:08.140]  that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[1:40:08.140 --> 1:40:13.060]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so that we can
[1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:17.300]  decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really
[1:40:17.300 --> 1:40:18.380]  does come down to that.
[1:40:18.380 --> 1:40:22.740]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[1:40:22.740 --> 1:40:27.020]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:40:27.020 --> 1:40:30.620]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[1:40:30.620 --> 1:40:36.300]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:40:36.300 --> 1:40:40.420]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington
[1:40:40.420 --> 1:40:45.740]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:49.020]  It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly and you're in the bad because
[1:40:49.020 --> 1:40:54.660]  Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:40:54.660 --> 1:40:58.420]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:40:58.420 --> 1:41:01.020]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[1:41:01.020 --> 1:41:02.020]  Why do you do that?
[1:41:02.020 --> 1:41:04.260]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:41:04.260 --> 1:41:08.660]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:12.660]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[1:41:12.660 --> 1:41:15.780]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:41:15.780 --> 1:41:16.940]  Boom, we did it.
[1:41:16.940 --> 1:41:17.940]  It's popular.
[1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:18.940]  It's X3.
[1:41:18.940 --> 1:41:19.940]  Is it better than X2?
[1:41:19.940 --> 1:41:20.940]  You decide.
[1:41:20.940 --> 1:41:21.940]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:41:21.940 --> 1:41:27.220]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping
[1:41:27.220 --> 1:41:28.780]  and that is down and out.
[1:41:28.780 --> 1:41:33.700]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:41:33.700 --> 1:41:38.540]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[1:41:38.540 --> 1:41:40.940]  at mforestore.com and free shipping.

[1:41:43.820 --> 1:41:45.220]  info at the same time.

[1:41:51.060 --> 1:41:57.180]  Actually, we bought this in blocks, UHF frequencies.
[1:41:57.180 --> 1:42:03.300]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[1:42:03.300 --> 1:42:10.380]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[1:42:10.380 --> 1:42:11.380]  battery.
[1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:17.780]  Now, with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[1:42:17.780 --> 1:42:18.780]  Excellent.

[1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:39.420]  are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.

[1:42:58.140 --> 1:43:25.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:30.620]  We've been watching it for the last 45 minutes, it's been live for 45 minutes, the crew has,
[1:43:30.620 --> 1:43:35.980]  and he flips through notes, goes to each reporter, knows the name, and then he reads a prepared
[1:43:35.980 --> 1:43:36.980]  question.
[1:43:36.980 --> 1:43:41.420]  So the war room today, I'm told, is going to go exclusively with this at the first, showing
[1:43:41.420 --> 1:43:43.940]  the staged can deal.
[1:43:43.940 --> 1:43:49.940]  He'll look at the note, call the person, they don't call on him, and then he reads off a
[1:43:49.940 --> 1:43:50.940]  note card.
[1:43:50.940 --> 1:43:59.020]  I mean, my lord, how long are they going to be able to keep this up, Robert Barnes?
[1:43:59.020 --> 1:44:00.020]  That's an open question.
[1:44:00.020 --> 1:44:04.660]  I mean, the other big issue in that context, well, two things, one, the whole world knows
[1:44:04.660 --> 1:44:05.660]  it.
[1:44:05.660 --> 1:44:09.500]  So the American media thinks that because they've gaslit the American public, that that means
[1:44:09.500 --> 1:44:12.460]  the rest of the world doesn't know who Joe Biden is.
[1:44:12.460 --> 1:44:17.820]  But that's why Putin made that joke very early on after Biden called Putin a killer.
[1:44:17.820 --> 1:44:23.860]  Putin's response was, I wish Biden good health with a sort of a wink at a nod.
[1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:31.140]  You have a dementia candidate as your president, so why is anyone going to take you seriously?
[1:44:31.140 --> 1:44:35.860]  And that's a serious problem, that when you have so many parts of the rest of the world
[1:44:35.860 --> 1:44:41.620]  that is not a snooker by the American media coverage, they're going to do things like
[1:44:41.620 --> 1:44:46.460]  have China come up and show up the Americans on the American's own soil, something they've
[1:44:46.460 --> 1:44:52.100]  never done before in their entire history of these two countries existing.
[1:44:52.100 --> 1:44:57.700]  So this is a sign of a very incredibly inept, incompetent, weak guy.
[1:44:57.700 --> 1:45:03.140]  I mean, he fell down literally three different, four different times just trying to begin.
[1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:06.300]  And remember, the whole reason why that's happening is he loves to run up the steps to
[1:45:06.300 --> 1:45:08.340]  show everybody how healthy he is.
[1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:12.220]  Everybody knows the guy is just a complete embarrassment.
[1:45:12.220 --> 1:45:17.660]  If people haven't been following this, but I watched a show called The Gaggle with Peter
[1:45:17.660 --> 1:45:23.460]  LaVell and George San Ueli, they've been detailing this in great detail.
[1:45:23.460 --> 1:45:24.460]  It's on YouTube and Rumble.
[1:45:24.460 --> 1:45:28.060]  But what they've been talking about, Kamala Harris is the one making all the calls to
[1:45:28.060 --> 1:45:29.060]  foreign leaders.
[1:45:29.060 --> 1:45:31.660]  They don't even let Biden on the phone with foreign leaders.
[1:45:31.660 --> 1:45:32.660]  Well, that's another thing.
[1:45:32.660 --> 1:45:36.060]  Why does he in like a video every day go, do I take my mask off?
[1:45:36.060 --> 1:45:37.060]  What do we do now?
[1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:38.060]  Tell me what to do.
[1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:40.540]  That's what someone in late dementia does.
[1:45:40.540 --> 1:45:44.500]  Oh, exactly. I think it was yesterday, he was sitting around the cabinet room and they
[1:45:44.500 --> 1:45:49.180]  had to lock out the media after he slipped up and said, now, who do I give this to?
[1:45:49.180 --> 1:45:53.460]  So he was, he clearly doesn't even know who it is that's running his own administration.
[1:45:53.460 --> 1:45:56.460]  He's just taking instructions and they take him to foreign leaders.
[1:45:56.460 --> 1:45:58.900]  You got your ear to the ground.
[1:45:58.900 --> 1:45:59.900]  We're hearing some certain names.
[1:45:59.900 --> 1:46:00.900]  Who's really running Biden?
[1:46:00.900 --> 1:46:06.180]  Who's the real consortium or plutocrats that are in control?
[1:46:06.180 --> 1:46:10.780]  Even of the deep state, which is almost in total control, they always had their favorite
[1:46:10.780 --> 1:46:12.620]  candidate was Kamala Harris.
[1:46:12.620 --> 1:46:18.100]  And so she just implements their agenda while they're helping her, by the way, that there's
[1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:20.460]  a reason why those Cuomo stories are leaking.
[1:46:20.460 --> 1:46:24.060]  There's reasons why the Whitmer stories are leaking and there's reasons why Newsom is
[1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:29.180]  probably going to face real competition, maybe from Tom Steyer in California, because Kamala
[1:46:29.180 --> 1:46:33.740]  is busy taking out kneecapping all of her potential 2024 opponents.
[1:46:33.740 --> 1:46:38.580]  But she's sort of the figurehead, but it's the deep state apparatus combined with Obama's
[1:46:38.580 --> 1:46:39.580]  shadow government.
[1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:43.060]  These were the less smart versions in Obama's administration.
[1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:44.580]  Well, what do you expect?
[1:46:44.580 --> 1:46:46.860]  You said start a war, start a civil war.
[1:46:46.860 --> 1:46:47.860]  That's their admitted plan.
[1:46:47.860 --> 1:46:50.620]  They admit it.
[1:46:50.620 --> 1:46:53.220]  Why can't they just back off and be pro-America?
[1:46:53.220 --> 1:46:54.660]  They run the country now.
[1:46:54.660 --> 1:46:58.020]  Why do they have the instinct to want to wreck the nation when they're in charge?
[1:46:58.020 --> 1:47:00.140]  Like again, if I was riding a horse, it's my horse.
[1:47:00.140 --> 1:47:03.220]  Why would I just go, you know, I'm just going to shoot this horse in the head for fun.
[1:47:03.220 --> 1:47:04.220]  That horse is pretty.
[1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:05.220]  It's beautiful.
[1:47:05.220 --> 1:47:06.660]  I feel threatened by how big and cool it is.
[1:47:06.660 --> 1:47:07.660]  I'm just going to shoot it in the head.
[1:47:07.660 --> 1:47:11.180]  I mean, that's the attitude of these, of these, of these.
[1:47:11.180 --> 1:47:12.780]  It's like a little pee-pee syndrome.
[1:47:12.780 --> 1:47:16.060]  I call it the chicken SH-T dimension.
[1:47:16.060 --> 1:47:17.740]  Like they run it.
[1:47:17.740 --> 1:47:18.740]  They hijack it.
[1:47:18.740 --> 1:47:22.980]  Like if I got a, and I stole a house from somebody, how am I going to burn it down just
[1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:25.140]  because I'm threatened by the marble columns?
[1:47:25.140 --> 1:47:28.220]  But I guess that's what the German barbarians did when they came into Rome.
[1:47:28.220 --> 1:47:30.060]  What is these people's problem?
[1:47:30.060 --> 1:47:34.340]  Well, you know, it's good, it's a book that you've referenced before, Alex, The Shadow
[1:47:34.340 --> 1:47:39.220]  of Kissinger, which is that sort of mindset, that sort of existential imperialism where
[1:47:39.220 --> 1:47:44.620]  you prove yourself simply by being imperialistic, taking action for its own sake, regardless
[1:47:44.620 --> 1:47:45.620]  of whether it has any reason or what.
[1:47:45.620 --> 1:47:46.620]  That's why you're so smart.
[1:47:46.620 --> 1:47:47.620]  You're right.
[1:47:47.620 --> 1:47:51.380]  I remember Richard Perl once, it was in the New York Times and he admitted it was true.
[1:47:51.380 --> 1:47:54.380]  He walked up to all these hot women and said, you know, I kill a lot of people.
[1:47:54.380 --> 1:47:55.380]  I'm powerful.
[1:47:55.380 --> 1:47:59.220]  He was like this 400 pound wimp and the women all went, ooh, and walked away.
[1:47:59.220 --> 1:48:00.220]  They didn't.
[1:48:00.220 --> 1:48:01.220]  Women don't want that.
[1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:03.620]  They want somebody that's fun and happy and protects them.
[1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:05.220]  Not a fat dude saying, I kill people.
[1:48:05.220 --> 1:48:06.980]  They're like a badass green beret.
[1:48:06.980 --> 1:48:08.940]  They still think it was creepy, but not as creepy.
[1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:13.020]  So it's exactly, it's like he called our troops cannon fodder and dumb animals.
[1:48:13.020 --> 1:48:15.260]  Why do they hate that, which gives them their power?
[1:48:15.260 --> 1:48:17.180]  It makes no sense.
[1:48:17.180 --> 1:48:20.780]  It's because for them, they live in their own world, their own moral philosophy, their
[1:48:20.780 --> 1:48:22.740]  own and bubbled universe.
[1:48:22.740 --> 1:48:26.140]  To some degree, they're more isolated than North Korea.
[1:48:26.140 --> 1:48:27.140]  I mean, that's how bad it is.
[1:48:27.140 --> 1:48:32.020]  You can have the North Korea premiere, make fun of Biden when you have Kim Jong-un doing
[1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:35.300]  his whole Biden mockery and satire.
[1:48:35.300 --> 1:48:39.540]  That shows you how disconnected the, our elites are to the whole rest of the world.
[1:48:39.540 --> 1:48:40.540]  Exactly.
[1:48:40.540 --> 1:48:42.940]  You notice how everyone just laughs at us now.
[1:48:42.940 --> 1:48:43.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:48:43.940 --> 1:48:49.180]  I mean, the North Korean got premier is making jokes about us and jokes that are actually
[1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:50.180]  kind of funny.
[1:48:50.180 --> 1:48:51.860]  I mean, that's sad.
[1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:54.780]  And but it's a, it's a showing of their mindset, their mentality.
[1:48:54.780 --> 1:48:59.580]  These people live, they live in a West Wing TV show of their own creation that only listens
[1:48:59.580 --> 1:49:00.580]  to the New York Times.
[1:49:00.580 --> 1:49:03.740]  And then the left says, oh, get in bed with China.
[1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:06.660]  Have all the comedians apologized for Asian jokes.
[1:49:06.660 --> 1:49:08.420]  The Asians only see that as weakness.
[1:49:08.420 --> 1:49:10.260]  Like, what's the left doing?
[1:49:10.260 --> 1:49:11.260]  They're crazy.
[1:49:11.260 --> 1:49:12.260]  Completely.
[1:49:12.260 --> 1:49:17.620]  In fact, they think their main goal is to lecture the Chinese about how woke they have
[1:49:17.620 --> 1:49:18.620]  failed to be.
[1:49:18.620 --> 1:49:20.820]  I mean, that's not, that's not a strategy.
[1:49:20.820 --> 1:49:22.420]  That's just a crack.
[1:49:22.420 --> 1:49:24.700]  Nobody in the rest of the world has any interest in it.
[1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:26.180]  Nobody has any concern with it.
[1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:32.540]  And exactly when they speak wokeness to like Africa or Asia or they look at us like we're
[1:49:32.540 --> 1:49:33.540]  speaking Martian.
[1:49:33.540 --> 1:49:34.540]  Oh, exactly.
[1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:40.020]  Eastern Europe, Central Europe, even Paris, even France is saying this woke stuff is insane.
[1:49:40.020 --> 1:49:46.300]  So they are basically, this is probably the weakest, worst national security team that's
[1:49:46.300 --> 1:49:50.340]  currently really complying with completely in control because Biden is not a restraint
[1:49:50.340 --> 1:49:51.340]  at all.
[1:49:51.340 --> 1:49:54.660]  Well, that's the next question, Obama's not stupid like Biden.
[1:49:54.660 --> 1:49:55.660]  What is his plan?
[1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:57.140]  Who has he worked for?
[1:49:57.140 --> 1:50:00.420]  The problem with Biden is the problem with Obama is he goes back and forth to his degree
[1:50:00.420 --> 1:50:01.420]  of interest.
[1:50:01.420 --> 1:50:07.020]  So these are Obama's less smart, sort of siblings that are running policy.
[1:50:07.020 --> 1:50:11.900]  So they have a lot of the same ideas of Obama, but they are, they're not as smart as Obama.
[1:50:11.900 --> 1:50:14.340]  And that's what makes them so dangerous.
[1:50:14.340 --> 1:50:19.140]  That's why the, one of these hotspots will become a full blown international crisis.
[1:50:19.140 --> 1:50:24.340]  In Ethiopia, Venezuela, Bolivia, or Ukraine, one of those four is going to be a hotspot
[1:50:24.340 --> 1:50:25.740]  by the end of the year.
[1:50:25.740 --> 1:50:28.940]  And we may, and they're going to find an excuse, they've already found an excuse to go back
[1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:33.020]  into Syria, already found an excuse to extend their stay in Afghanistan.
[1:50:33.020 --> 1:50:36.820]  Now they're going to find an excuse to go somewhere else to prove how tough we are and
[1:50:36.820 --> 1:50:39.780]  how, how big they are and how important they are.
[1:50:39.780 --> 1:50:41.300]  They can't help themselves.
[1:50:41.300 --> 1:50:45.860]  And the problem is they could trigger conflict with a nuclear power in the process.
[1:50:45.860 --> 1:50:46.860]  Absolutely.
[1:50:46.860 --> 1:50:49.180]  All right, Robert Barnes, incredible interview.
[1:50:49.180 --> 1:50:51.500]  You're going to be joining me this Saturday.
[1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:53.900]  We're going to tape to air 11 to one.
[1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:56.140]  It'll probably air about three PM Sunday.
[1:50:56.140 --> 1:51:00.740]  Again, it's like a live interview, but we add little, little articles and little, little
[1:51:00.740 --> 1:51:02.220]  documentation to it.
[1:51:02.220 --> 1:51:04.140]  Again, you just are kicking ass.
[1:51:04.140 --> 1:51:07.580]  You know, I love the French lawyer.
[1:51:07.580 --> 1:51:10.580]  I probably watched 10 of those shows or more before you were all with him.
[1:51:10.580 --> 1:51:12.060]  I was actually familiar with him.
[1:51:12.060 --> 1:51:13.380]  Tell me about some of the other shows you're doing.
[1:51:13.380 --> 1:51:14.380]  There's such big hits.
[1:51:14.380 --> 1:51:15.380]  Sure.
[1:51:15.380 --> 1:51:16.380]  Yeah.
[1:51:16.380 --> 1:51:21.460]  I'm going to do a show with Viva Fry, who's a Canadian lawyer who's helping support.
[1:51:21.460 --> 1:51:27.100]  His publicity, drawing attention to the, they locked up a pastor for preaching in Canada.
[1:51:27.100 --> 1:51:29.220]  That's what they locked him up for, for just holding servants.
[1:51:29.220 --> 1:51:30.940]  You guys help get him out.
[1:51:30.940 --> 1:51:31.940]  Absolutely.
[1:51:31.940 --> 1:51:33.300]  He helped him get him out, which is great.
[1:51:33.300 --> 1:51:39.240]  We have a local page called Viva Barnes Law dot locals dot com, where we do some exclusive
[1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:43.780]  stuff that's fun and interesting and going to be bringing suit soon against the Federal
[1:51:43.780 --> 1:51:44.780]  Reserve because.
[1:51:44.780 --> 1:51:45.780]  Hold on.
[1:51:45.780 --> 1:51:46.780]  One minute.
[1:51:46.780 --> 1:51:47.780]  I got to go to break.
[1:51:47.780 --> 1:51:48.780]  I forgot about that.
[1:51:48.780 --> 1:51:49.780]  I said, I forget break to break.
[1:51:49.780 --> 1:51:50.780]  I want to come back with a Federal Reserve suit.
[1:51:50.780 --> 1:51:51.780]  And I forgot one off the other.
[1:51:51.780 --> 1:51:52.780]  Stay there.
[1:51:52.780 --> 1:51:53.780]  Do five more minutes with us.
[1:51:53.780 --> 1:51:59.660]  Then we have Andrew Torba of Gab battling to stay online as their viewership and readership
[1:51:59.660 --> 1:52:00.780]  and membership explodes.
[1:52:00.780 --> 1:52:01.780]  That's all coming up.
[1:52:01.780 --> 1:52:03.620]  Let me do this plug here today because we don't do this.
[1:52:03.620 --> 1:52:04.620]  We won't be here.
[1:52:04.620 --> 1:52:07.620]  Plus, these are great products and folks, I may look like hell.
[1:52:07.620 --> 1:52:11.900]  That's because I eat massive amounts of red meat and I drink too much and I should probably
[1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:12.900]  probably go to rehab.
[1:52:12.900 --> 1:52:18.540]  I don't know why the people just totaled through so all I can do at this point, but the supplements
[1:52:18.540 --> 1:52:19.540]  are incredible.
[1:52:19.540 --> 1:52:22.580]  And anything I promote is the very best.
[1:52:22.580 --> 1:52:26.580]  I don't promote something until I'm sure it's amazing.
[1:52:26.580 --> 1:52:29.460]  Our water filtration highest rated super low price.
[1:52:29.460 --> 1:52:32.580]  Our storeable food highest quality for a price you're going to get like that.
[1:52:32.580 --> 1:52:34.980]  It's just amazing because it's karmic for me.
[1:52:34.980 --> 1:52:38.020]  Let me tell you what I do to you.
[1:52:38.020 --> 1:52:42.140]  I went back at me and it's metaphysical is the only reason I've survived this long and
[1:52:42.140 --> 1:52:46.100]  I don't even think is I don't even do it like magic that I'd only do good things.
[1:52:46.100 --> 1:52:48.540]  That's how it was built.
[1:52:48.540 --> 1:52:50.420]  But at the same time, I need your support.
[1:52:50.420 --> 1:52:52.220]  Please don't let these monsters take me off air.
[1:52:52.220 --> 1:52:56.580]  God, I just want to stay on this fight so bad it drives me crazy.
[1:52:56.580 --> 1:52:59.420]  And if you knew what they were doing behind the scenes, you'd really support us, but I
[1:52:59.420 --> 1:53:03.380]  can't tell you all of it because the enemy needs that data to know where to concentrate
[1:53:03.380 --> 1:53:04.380]  their attacks.
[1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:05.620]  But you can see it all in the news.
[1:53:05.620 --> 1:53:09.940]  It's not fun, but I trust in Jesus and I'm willing to go all the way, but I need your
[1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:10.940]  financial support.
[1:53:10.940 --> 1:53:15.460]  So pre-shipping on a bunch of great products, Vaso Beats Alpha Power Process Guard sold

[1:54:45.460 --> 1:54:46.460]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[1:54:46.460 --> 1:54:47.460]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[1:54:47.460 --> 1:54:48.460]  I'm trying to move quicker.
[1:54:48.460 --> 1:54:49.460]  Hey, Alex.
[1:54:49.460 --> 1:54:50.460]  Welcome.
[1:54:50.460 --> 1:54:54.140]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[1:54:54.140 --> 1:54:57.260]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[1:54:57.260 --> 1:55:03.980]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[1:55:03.980 --> 1:55:05.460]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:55:05.460 --> 1:55:09.820]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:55:09.820 --> 1:55:11.260]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:55:11.260 --> 1:55:16.980]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:55:16.980 --> 1:55:23.740]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[1:55:23.740 --> 1:55:28.700]  kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:55:28.700 --> 1:55:33.980]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:55:33.980 --> 1:55:35.820]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:55:35.820 --> 1:55:40.260]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[1:55:40.260 --> 1:55:47.660]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[1:55:47.660 --> 1:55:51.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:55:51.660 --> 1:56:00.060]  All right, final segment with Robert Barnes and Holy Mackerel.
[1:56:00.060 --> 1:56:04.700]  The crew was showing me transcripts of what Biden said in the last hour of his press conference.
[1:56:04.700 --> 1:56:08.540]  Train wreck is not even a word.
[1:56:08.540 --> 1:56:11.140]  Wait till I play this next segment where Barnes leaves us.
[1:56:11.140 --> 1:56:12.460]  I'm not going to even tell you.
[1:56:12.460 --> 1:56:15.260]  I'm sure a lot of you already know, but this is a new one.
[1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:19.500]  I'll just tell Barnes right now, President Biden on filibuster debate.
[1:56:19.500 --> 1:56:24.140]  I believe we should go back to the position of a filibuster that existed just when I came
[1:56:24.140 --> 1:56:30.100]  to the United States a 120 years ago, it's being abused in a gigantic way.
[1:56:30.100 --> 1:56:32.100]  And I'm told there's even bigger gas barns.
[1:56:32.100 --> 1:56:33.100]  This is crazy.
[1:56:33.100 --> 1:56:37.140]  Yeah, it's the reason why they were trying to keep them off of those press conferences
[1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:40.260]  and keep them in bed by three o'clock every afternoon.
[1:56:40.260 --> 1:56:41.900]  So it's extraordinary.
[1:56:41.900 --> 1:56:47.780]  I mean, it's a reflection of the state of affairs and where his mindset is really what
[1:56:47.780 --> 1:56:51.660]  the, you know, basically the Fed is running our monetary policy, the deep states running
[1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:56.460]  our national security policy and a bunch of knockoff from the Obama administration are
[1:56:56.460 --> 1:56:58.340]  running our diplomatic policy.
[1:56:58.340 --> 1:57:04.460]  And it's a triangle, a trifecta of defeatism that it's going to be a debacle and could
[1:57:04.460 --> 1:57:08.340]  result in, you know, economic collapse and major war.
[1:57:08.340 --> 1:57:09.340]  I agree.
[1:57:09.340 --> 1:57:13.220]  It's like Tokyo Electric building nuclear reactors on a fault line in this anomaly.
[1:57:13.220 --> 1:57:14.220]  We got four minutes left.
[1:57:14.220 --> 1:57:15.220]  Federal Reserve suit.
[1:57:15.220 --> 1:57:16.340]  You're getting ready to follow that.
[1:57:16.340 --> 1:57:17.340]  That's big news.
[1:57:17.340 --> 1:57:18.340]  Tell us about that.
[1:57:18.340 --> 1:57:19.340]  Absolutely.
[1:57:19.340 --> 1:57:20.340]  Yeah.
[1:57:20.340 --> 1:57:21.340]  So exclusive here.
[1:57:21.340 --> 1:57:24.020]  But the goal is we need to find a way to audit the Fed.
[1:57:24.020 --> 1:57:29.100]  The Fed has found 100 ways to evade that by evading certain restrictions in the law.
[1:57:29.100 --> 1:57:31.260]  So we're going to use the Freedom of Information Act.
[1:57:31.260 --> 1:57:33.540]  George Gammon is orchestrating the effort.
[1:57:33.540 --> 1:57:36.260]  I agree to be the lead legal counsel in the effort.
[1:57:36.260 --> 1:57:40.540]  And we came up with a strategy to sue the Fed by using the Freedom of Information Act
[1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:45.340]  to either force the Fed to disclose, to audit the Fed, to disclose the records and information,
[1:57:45.340 --> 1:57:47.860]  especially what they've been doing over the last several years.
[1:57:47.860 --> 1:57:51.780]  So I'm going to be asking for records that date back to 1913 and some of their internal
[1:57:51.780 --> 1:57:57.020]  correspondence at critical times of crisis over the last almost more than 100 years.
[1:57:57.020 --> 1:58:00.300]  And in the same time period, either the Fed is going to produce that documentation, allow
[1:58:00.300 --> 1:58:04.180]  us to audit them, or they're going to have to legally admit that what they've been doing
[1:58:04.180 --> 1:58:08.820]  has been illegal because they'll say, hey, this wasn't done in a legal capacity so we
[1:58:08.820 --> 1:58:11.220]  don't have to produce any FOIA records.
[1:58:11.220 --> 1:58:15.260]  But that will be an admission that they've been acting outside of what the law allows
[1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:19.060]  them to do, and that will allow a second level of lawsuits to be brought.
[1:58:19.060 --> 1:58:23.420]  So the goal is in order to audit the Fed, we got to sue the Fed, use the Freedom of Information
[1:58:23.420 --> 1:58:24.420]  Act against them.
[1:58:24.420 --> 1:58:28.180]  There's actually been good precedence in the last 10 years against the Fed.
[1:58:28.180 --> 1:58:32.460]  They usually hide their records with the individual boards of governors, the individual constituent
[1:58:32.460 --> 1:58:33.460]  banks.
[1:58:33.460 --> 1:58:36.380]  There have now been decisions that have been issued over the past five years that say those
[1:58:36.380 --> 1:58:38.500]  banks are subject to FOIA as well.
[1:58:38.500 --> 1:58:42.780]  So we're going to find out what's been really going on as they just print print cash as
[1:58:42.780 --> 1:58:47.060]  they favor certain people, disfavor other people, and how much they're putting America's
[1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:52.460]  economy at risk by doing things that the law never approved or authorized them to do.
[1:58:52.460 --> 1:58:56.580]  So it's going to be a fun little suit, and it's time to find a way to audit the Fed by
[1:58:56.580 --> 1:58:57.580]  suing the Fed.
[1:58:57.580 --> 1:58:58.900]  Barnes, we've got two minutes left.
[1:58:58.900 --> 1:58:59.900]  This is intriguing.
[1:58:59.900 --> 1:59:04.060]  Sue them on the FOIA because they claim their government, but they're really private, but
[1:59:04.060 --> 1:59:08.500]  they're involved in public operations at a level even above the executive branch.
[1:59:08.500 --> 1:59:10.700]  I don't see how they can block this.
[1:59:10.700 --> 1:59:14.460]  Yeah, that's their problem, their problem is they either have to say, you know what,
[1:59:14.460 --> 1:59:18.820]  we've really been doing this all off the books, but that means they've been doing it outside
[1:59:18.820 --> 1:59:23.300]  of the law, or they have to admit that in fact the nature of their process is that they
[1:59:23.300 --> 1:59:25.060]  have to disclose all these records.
[1:59:25.060 --> 1:59:29.060]  All their internal communications, their internal notes, their internal emails, their communications
[1:59:29.060 --> 1:59:33.220]  with other Wall Street banks, with other politicians, all the rest with the press.
[1:59:33.220 --> 1:59:38.340]  Find out all this detail and go back to some of what they did back in 1913, 1415 and 16,
[1:59:38.340 --> 1:59:41.780]  some key records that no one has actually ever requested.
[1:59:41.780 --> 1:59:45.580]  There have been a bunch of key records that no one's ever sought that revealed their own
[1:59:45.580 --> 1:59:50.540]  understanding of the legal limits on their authority and their attempt over the past
[1:59:50.540 --> 1:59:55.540]  century to evade those limits and to catch them with the trap of a FOIA lawsuit.
[1:59:55.540 --> 2:00:01.140]  So I was about to say you've got some big eggs, wavos as they say in Spanish to do this
[2:00:01.140 --> 2:00:03.460]  because anybody that's tried this, they come after massively.
[2:00:03.460 --> 2:00:08.660]  So kudos and praise to you and prayers to you and this crew doing this because again,
[2:00:08.660 --> 2:00:11.380]  they always feel Congress, oh, we're open, we're under scrutiny, never been in audit,
[2:00:11.380 --> 2:00:12.380]  never been in control.
[2:00:12.380 --> 2:00:14.460]  They said they're governmental, they're not.
[2:00:14.460 --> 2:00:19.420]  And so this is going to absolutely be a huge issue.
[2:00:19.420 --> 2:00:20.420]  What's the timeframe?
[2:00:20.420 --> 2:00:21.420]  30 seconds left.
[2:00:21.420 --> 2:00:24.020]  When can we expect the suit to be filed?
[2:00:24.020 --> 2:00:27.740]  So there's going to be a public effort to focus attention on the suit where people can
[2:00:27.740 --> 2:00:33.660]  follow the suit and I'll be putting that up at the VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com site where they
[2:00:33.660 --> 2:00:37.540]  can track the information as to the filings, there's some FOIA filings that come before
[2:00:37.540 --> 2:00:41.340]  the suit and we're going to be doing it this year.
[2:00:41.340 --> 2:00:42.340]  Beautiful.
[2:00:42.340 --> 2:00:46.540]  Robert Barnes will join me in a commercial free Saturday Transmission and InfoWars coming
[2:00:46.540 --> 2:00:47.540]  up Saturday.
[2:00:47.540 --> 2:00:48.540]  Thank you, Robert Barnes.
[2:00:48.540 --> 2:00:56.740]  You'll be back with Andrew Torbo.
[2:00:56.740 --> 2:00:59.740]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:00:59.740 --> 2:01:00.740]  Go ahead.
[2:01:00.740 --> 2:01:02.740]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:01:02.740 --> 2:01:08.380]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:01:08.380 --> 2:01:14.020]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but
[2:01:14.020 --> 2:01:20.140]  since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:01:20.140 --> 2:01:26.200]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought,
[2:01:26.200 --> 2:01:30.040]  You know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:31.040]  situation.
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:35.640]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:40.800]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:46.120]  wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:51.320]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:58.320]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:48.680]  Well, Andrew Torba has been a busy man, a busy father, a busy husband, a busy American,
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:50.640]  a busy patriot.
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:55.600]  He was in big tech many years ago, Silicon Valley, very successful coder, programmer,
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:03:00.680]  operations guy, saw the tyranny, went and started gab long before the mass censorship
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:01.680]  even kicked in.
[2:03:01.680 --> 2:03:07.120]  He saw the storm clouds and he has a diverse side of liberals and conservatives, gay, straight,
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:12.520]  all of it, but they've tried to shut him down, calling him a white supremacist and our horrible
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:21.760]  leftist chai-com governor, has called for him to be shut down, he says, I support conservative
[2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:27.520]  free speech, shut down gab the Nazis, I think Torba ought to fall suit against him, very
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:28.520]  ashamed of Texas.
[2:03:28.520 --> 2:03:34.160]  I love my state, ashamed of who's hijacked it, 600 plus percent traffic, they already
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:38.880]  shut down parlor, why Trump said I might go to parlor, boom, they're just gone, think
[2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:44.680]  about that, because you can't have an alternative, and so I'm very glad and very happy and he's
[2:03:44.680 --> 2:03:50.040]  gracious in his busy time to join us gab.com, we've got a couple big sites for him for wars
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:53.640]  and Alex Jones and hundreds of thousands of followers over there at gab, we should probably
[2:03:53.640 --> 2:03:56.960]  pull those pages up and invite folks to go follow over there, they've got a lot of new
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:00.920]  features, a lot of great things, works a lot better than parlor and we're not in competition
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:04.640]  with parlor, he's not either, we want everybody to do great, but it's one of the best sites,
[2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:09.080]  he's worked for a lot of bugs, had his bank accounts taken repeatedly, had their servers
[2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:13.640]  taken, had their domain names taken, they have been through the ringer, because anybody
[2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:18.920]  doing a good job is, and so he's wearing the green hat for radio listeners, make speech
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:23.520]  free again, think about how alien that is, that was something we all knew, you didn't
[2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:29.400]  deal, you didn't take away, and now it's like that rare diamond, so Mr. Torba great
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:33.280]  to have you here, I could ask so many questions, I could bring up so many points, but I know
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:37.320]  you've got your own up to the minute spiel to tell the millions of listeners, so thanks
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:40.480]  for joining us, and what's front and center on your radar right now?
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:46.200]  Front and center on my radar right now, Alex is defending free speech online, it's the
[2:04:46.200 --> 2:04:51.760]  same thing that's been on my radar for the past five years, we have grown tremendously
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:56.720]  as you noted over the past six months, we have 25, 30 million people that are visiting
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:01.920]  the site and using our products and services every single month, and we're forced to be
[2:05:01.920 --> 2:05:07.880]  reckoned with, so as you mentioned, we've faced tremendous adversity as you yourself
[2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:12.600]  have, and as you continue to do, and as we continue to face as well, we've been banned
[2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:18.480]  from both app stores, hosting providers, payment processors, and just in the past six weeks
[2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:22.320]  we've been dealing with getting banned from about five or six different banks at this
[2:05:22.320 --> 2:05:26.760]  point, so that's our latest struggle, it's just struggling to keep a bank account open
[2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:31.240]  in the United States of America, as an American citizen running an American company that's
[2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:36.360]  doing nothing illegal, it's really madness, this is the world that we're living in too,
[2:05:36.360 --> 2:05:37.360]  so we're in good place.
[2:05:37.360 --> 2:05:40.240]  You're doing what Twitter was doing two years ago, you're doing what Facebook was doing
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:44.480]  three years ago, I mean you're literally just creating a free open forum, you've got rules,
[2:05:44.480 --> 2:05:48.120]  can't have terror, can't have crime, can't have porn, whatever, and it doesn't matter
[2:05:48.120 --> 2:05:51.800]  because they don't want anybody to have a voice, which shows how much trouble our country's
[2:05:51.800 --> 2:05:55.240]  in, I mean we're really under an authoritarian takeover.
[2:05:55.240 --> 2:06:00.680]  Absolutely, we've reached the point now where you see Governor Abbott of Texas is coming
[2:06:00.680 --> 2:06:06.640]  after me, we see the ADL is lobbying the Department of Justice to investigate GAB and to throw
[2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:08.160]  me in jail, for what?
[2:06:08.160 --> 2:06:12.520]  I don't know, but they've reached the point where they can no longer deep platform us
[2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:18.080]  at any level, we've become so resilient that they have no other choice but now to lobby
[2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:24.800]  the state to smear us, to defame us, and to throw me in jail, to shut the website down,
[2:06:24.800 --> 2:06:28.440]  that's what their next agenda is, is they want to shut us down completely, they want
[2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:32.560]  me shut up, they want the millions of people that are using our site shut up, and you know
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:36.640]  what, we're not going to stop, there's nothing that's going to stop us, we have God on our
[2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:40.840]  side, we have had God on our side for the past five years, and that's why we continue
[2:06:40.840 --> 2:06:45.640]  to survive and thrive and grow, and that's not going to change anytime soon Alex.
[2:06:45.640 --> 2:06:49.600]  So we're going to continue fighting and they can come at us all they want, but it's only
[2:06:49.600 --> 2:06:54.560]  making us stronger, it's only making us grow bigger, so I'm happy to carry the cross of
[2:06:54.560 --> 2:07:02.080]  being smeared and being defamed and being attacked by now governors of states, it's insanity.
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:06.640]  I'll tell you, for TV and radio listeners, the crew can pull it up, I didn't get it before
[2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:10.680]  the show, but I know it was there, I saw it last week, it was like, governor of Texas
[2:07:10.680 --> 2:07:14.240]  calls for Gab to be shut down, first he says, oh I'm going to stand up against Big Tech
[2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:18.520]  censorship, and then he gets up there with Israeli flag, I know you're not against Israel,
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:22.120]  I'm not either, but if you were, that'd be right, and then they go, I'm going to shut
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:29.120]  down the white supremacist tab, and he's like this daughtering idiot, lying about you, that
[2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:30.120]  is outrageous.
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:35.920]  Well, it's crazy Alex, because five days prior to this statement that he made about us, he's
[2:07:35.920 --> 2:07:39.200]  out there saying, I'm going to take on Big Tech, and we're going to do something about
[2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:45.120]  this censorship, and free speech is crucial, and then I see this video, and Alex, I thought
[2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:49.080]  it was a deep fake, I didn't believe that it was an actual video from him at first, I had
[2:07:49.080 --> 2:07:53.240]  to do a double take on it when I first saw it, and it's just, you know, it's craziness,
[2:07:53.240 --> 2:07:54.240]  it's absolute craziness.
[2:07:54.240 --> 2:07:58.720]  That's what it is, it's psych warfare, when they go, oh I'm for free speech, but take
[2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:03.320]  it, there it is, Texas governor, brands Gab, anti-semitic platform, calls for it to be
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:07.920]  shut down, what the hell is going on?
[2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:14.120]  Now this is a red state Alex, I mean you're living in Texas, it's a conservative state,
[2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:18.440]  right, it's a deep red state, at least that's what I thought, and it appears what's going
[2:08:18.440 --> 2:08:22.920]  on in the Texas Republican party is there's some sort of civil war going on between the
[2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:29.200]  establishment rhinos, and the puppets of the oligarchs, and the party of the patriots,
[2:08:29.200 --> 2:08:33.760]  right, so there's this division happening, and the party of the patriots, that's the
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:38.560]  weird thing about this, is the official Republican party of Texas, the GOP of Texas has an account
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:43.080]  on Gab that is verified by us, so they have an official account, and they're going against
[2:08:43.080 --> 2:08:46.120]  what the governor is saying, and from what I'm hearing this is all about.
[2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:51.480]  The legislature's come out in defense of you, I should have said up front, hey, the founder
[2:08:51.480 --> 2:08:56.400]  of Gab and battled free speech activists for everybody, liberal, conservative, gay, straight,
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:00.440]  whatever, black, white, he has been attacked by the governor as an anti-Semite, and the
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:05.120]  state legislature came out and said it's not true, and they have a site on your site,
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:06.440]  that's just incredible.
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:12.240]  Yeah, they went against what the governor said, and the governor appears to have some
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:19.720]  liberal subversives around him who are trying to push the liberal agenda in the GOP Republican
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:25.320]  party of Texas, and the Republican party itself, which is led up by Allen West, is not having
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:28.680]  it, and they doubled down, and they said, we're not leaving Gab, we're going to continue
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:32.880]  to post on Gab, and we're not going to listen to the governor, so that was very reassuring.
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:36.840]  Exactly, that's key in free speech, because one person out of 30 million visitors a month
[2:09:36.840 --> 2:09:40.600]  says kill people, or do whatever they get in trouble, not everybody else does, it's
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:45.560]  like if somebody said, well someone used an AT&T phone to call in a bomb threat, so everyone
[2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:50.120]  has their phones taken away, that's authoritarianism, that's not how we work.
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:53.480]  And Alex, let me be clear, if people are making threats of violence, if they're breaking the
[2:09:53.480 --> 2:09:57.840]  law, we have zero tolerance for that, we absolutely do take action on that stuff, each and every
[2:09:57.840 --> 2:09:58.840]  day.
[2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:03.360]  Absolutely, it's exactly, but you can't have private constraint, you can't be hovering
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:06.640]  over every comment, what they hate is the free speech.
[2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:10.320]  Exactly, that's what they want, they want to use their artificial intelligence that
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:14.840]  they have on Facebook, on Twitter, et cetera, to pre-scan every comment before it goes out
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:15.840]  and-
[2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:18.400]  Start over, I interrupt, that's the key, is they admitted that congressional hearings
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:22.800]  two years ago, AI will soon be in control, will be able to censor info wars, now it's
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:25.800]  in there, they don't like you because you're not AI censored.
[2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:30.380]  Right, and what's interesting Alex is they can use this AI to censor memes and to fact
[2:10:30.380 --> 2:10:34.880]  check and to shut up conservatives, but they can't stop the child exploitation problem that's
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:40.280]  going on on Facebook, an annual report just came out that Facebook is the number one
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:10:45.240]  source of child exploitation on the internet, above even the porn sites, right, so, and
[2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:48.120]  they're allowed to be on app stores, they're allowed to have hosting providers, they're
[2:10:48.120 --> 2:10:52.360]  allowed to do business with all these advertisers, nobody talks about this, that Facebook is
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:56.720]  the number one source of child exploitation, but they're mad because a few people say some
[2:10:56.720 --> 2:10:59.240]  mean words on Gabbard and we don't do anything to stop them.
[2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:01.800]  All right, you're going to get the floor on the other side because I'm so excited to
[2:11:01.800 --> 2:11:05.800]  have you and I'm ranting, but you just brought up the key here, massive pedophilia on Facebook
[2:11:05.800 --> 2:11:10.600]  and Twitter, massive racial attacks, massive snuff films, so they can then point at you
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:14.240]  and say, oh, but they had one racist on there and that makes them look good.
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:18.880]  They're using you like Apple runs death camps in China, but oh, they find Black Lives Matter
[2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:19.880]  as a distraction.
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:25.640]  Gabb.com, everybody knows what it is, Info Wars, this show, Alex Jones, you're truly,
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:29.480]  we have sites there, visit us there, it's a great site, adding new features, we'll talk
[2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:34.960]  about recapping what he got to just now about the horrible things that other big tech are
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:39.160]  doing while they demonize Gabb, and then some of the great features at Gabb.com, why you
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:44.040]  all need to get on Gabb and everybody needs to support Gabb because Andrew Torba and Gabb
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:45.040]  is the real deal.
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:48.640]  I'll also ask him, how do you know five years ago when he founded this, this was all coming?
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:49.640]  He's another trailblazer.
[2:11:49.640 --> 2:11:50.640]  Stay with us.
[2:11:50.640 --> 2:11:54.760]  Brain Force Plus, by the way, one of my all time favorite products, I completely owe my
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:59.400]  ability to do this job, I owe my ability to have graduated college four or five years
[2:11:59.400 --> 2:12:03.760]  ago, I owe it completely to Brain Force Plus, one of the most powerful nutraceuticals you
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:04.760]  will find.
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:08.320]  I put it right up there with Turbo Force, I love Turbo Force, it's great, but when you

[2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:19.320]  Alright, my friends, thank you so much for tuning in out of the sea of information, choosing
[2:14:19.320 --> 2:14:23.080]  us, we're all of this together, I love you, out of what color you are, where you came
[2:14:23.080 --> 2:14:27.360]  from, if you love God and justice, we're brothers and sisters together.
[2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:32.600]  Understand that the corrupt evil forces of the globalists that are now out in the open,
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:38.160]  no more debate about it, literally work around the clock to silence this broadcast and to
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:47.440]  silence you and to silence Andrew Torba, who would dare go out and who would dare five
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:54.040]  years ago seeing what was coming, very successful in Silicon Valley and Bill Gabb.
[2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:58.160]  And so I'm not going to get into inside baseball here, but I know a lot of people and a lot
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:03.400]  of things, I can tell you, they could have had parlor continue on, folks, the word is
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.520]  they got paid off to shut down.
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:12.720]  And so there's not a lot of OACs in this desert left, and these OACs are going to get more
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:18.000]  precious as they're taken away, so recap what you said about the future next segment and
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.200]  more, but Andrew Torba, I was interrupting my segment, you've got the floor, talk about
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:27.880]  the huge news of your crimes supposedly versus Facebook's crimes, and where all this is going
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:30.280]  and how we fight back.
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:36.360]  Well, Alex, there's just a report that was released in early February that said that
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:43.280]  there are over 20 million cases of child exploitation on Facebook that happened last year alone.
[2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:49.240]  They're the number one source of child exploitation on the Internet, surpassing even pornography
[2:15:49.240 --> 2:15:50.320]  websites.
[2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:54.240]  They are allowed to be on app stores, they are allowed to have banks, they are allowed
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:16:00.080]  to have hosting providers, they have advertisers that are funding this activity, right?
[2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:02.320]  This is madness.
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:05.240]  We don't have any pornography at all on Gab.
[2:16:05.240 --> 2:16:08.080]  We have zero tolerance for pornography in general.
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:11.920]  We also work with law enforcement to prevent things like threats of violence and criminal
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:12.920]  activity.
[2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:13.920]  And by the way, that's not censorship.
[2:16:13.920 --> 2:16:17.200]  You upfront say this is not on our platform, it's the only way you can do it.
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:18.200]  Right.
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:22.760]  But we have very clear rules, very clear lines in the sand.
[2:16:22.760 --> 2:16:27.360]  We have law and order, Gab is not an anarchist website, it never has been.
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:32.480]  But because we have people that share information that the oligarchs and the people in power
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:37.180]  don't want people knowing about, and we don't put a stop to that with artificial intelligence
[2:16:37.180 --> 2:16:43.600]  or with tens of thousands of blue-haired moderators out of San Francisco, they want to shut us
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:44.600]  down.
[2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:49.840]  We can't have people getting access to information from places like InfoWars, Bright Bar, Gateway
[2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:54.680]  Pundit, alternative media sources, and just individual people who are down on the ground
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:58.000]  out in real life reporting on things as they happen.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:00.080]  They need to control the flow of information.
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:01.080]  They need to control them.
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:02.080]  Well, that's the bottom line.
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:05.680]  Anything that you can do legally in the town square, you can do it, Gab.
[2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:06.680]  It's real simple.
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:09.040]  Whatever you can do in a town square, you can do it InfoWars.
[2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:14.320]  You can't rape kids, you can't hand out pornography, you can't kill people, you can't do...
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:17.920]  You can't eat poop in the town square like the Liberals do, but like you said, they can
[2:17:17.920 --> 2:17:20.640]  do every crazy thing they want on all these other platforms.
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:21.640]  You run a good operation.
[2:17:21.640 --> 2:17:22.640]  You're the bad guy.
[2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:26.880]  Yeah, you go on Twitter, Alex, and you're going to find young teenage girls selling
[2:17:26.880 --> 2:17:31.000]  their bodies, posting naked photos of themselves, child exploitation.
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:33.040]  You'll find people selling drugs.
[2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:38.280]  You'll find all sorts of just the generosity and madness and illegal activity, and it's
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:39.280]  just allowed.
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:40.280]  It's overlooked.
[2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:41.960]  Nobody talks about it in the press.
[2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:43.080]  Apple and Google don't care.
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:45.480]  They allow it on their app stores.
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:52.440]  But somebody shares something, alternative medicine or alternative information or news
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:57.440]  about COVID that they don't want you to know, and all of a sudden you're like domestic terrorists
[2:17:57.440 --> 2:17:58.440]  because you're talking about things.
[2:17:58.440 --> 2:18:00.800]  Any healthy communication is banned.
[2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:03.160]  Anything degenerate and evil is promoted.
[2:18:03.160 --> 2:18:06.160]  Yeah, it's upside down world, absolutely.
[2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:12.160]  A big part of this is we have a lot of Christians on Gab, Alex, from around the world, including
[2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:17.120]  Christians in places like China, where it's very dangerous being a Christian.
[2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:22.120]  We take it for granted here in the United States that we can openly express and share
[2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:23.640]  our faith and share the gospel.
[2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:26.120]  But they're putting skin in the game.
[2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:29.000]  They're absolutely putting skin in the game, and I think that's one of the reasons why
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:33.880]  they're coming after Gab and why they're coming after Info Wars and others so aggressively
[2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:38.920]  is because Christians are organizing and Christians are speaking freely and sharing
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:42.000]  the gospel and sharing a message of hope.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:47.280]  With this critical theory, with this communism, this cancel culture, there is no redemption,
[2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:53.000]  there is no salvation, there is no forgiveness, and the gospel message of Jesus Christ offers
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  all of that, right?
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:57.160]  So they don't want people to have forgiveness.
[2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:01.400]  They want them enslaved to addiction and enslaved to sin and enslaved to the system,
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:02.400]  and the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:05.200]  That's another key point is the left never gives you absolution.
[2:19:05.200 --> 2:19:06.200]  Exactly.
[2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:09.360]  You're always guilty, whatever you did.
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:14.520]  No matter if you sent a tweet 10 years ago when you were 14 years old, you're going to
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:18.320]  get fired from your job because you said something on Twitter 10 years ago.
[2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:23.200]  No matter how much you grovel, no matter how much you apologize, you're guilty and you're
[2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:24.200]  guilty for life.
[2:19:24.200 --> 2:19:27.280]  That's huge because the left claims, oh, do whatever you want, there's no judgment,
[2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:29.080]  but they're all about judgment.
[2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:30.080]  Absolutely.
[2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:33.240]  They're the most judgmental people, they're the most racist people, they're the most
[2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:38.680]  intolerant people, and ultimately everything that they're doing is projecting their sin
[2:19:38.680 --> 2:19:44.200]  and their evil onto the rest of the world and onto the people that are God's children,
[2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:49.480]  that are spreading the gospel, that are spreading truth and goodness into this world of darkness.
[2:19:49.480 --> 2:19:54.960]  So they can project all they want, but what we need to remember, I know times right now
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:20:00.760]  are very tough for a lot of people after this year of lockdown, after this rigged election,
[2:20:00.760 --> 2:20:05.200]  all the crazy things that the Biden administration, the Democrats are doing, but what we need
[2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:10.480]  to remember is that we serve and worship the creator of the universe and he has a plan.
[2:20:10.480 --> 2:20:17.200]  So I have never been more hopeful and more faithful in our God and in his plan for this
[2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:19.480]  country and for our people.
[2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:22.720]  We're going through this for a reason and I think we're going to come out on the other
[2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:28.640]  end of it stronger because of it, if we unite together and continue pressing forward in this
[2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:33.040]  spiritual war, Alex, it's a spiritual war that we're in right now and people need to
[2:20:33.040 --> 2:20:36.800]  wake up and realize and choose which side do they want to be on.
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:40.280]  Do they want to be on the side of light, on the side of God, the creator, or do they want
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:45.080]  to be on the side of darkness and evil and use these platforms that allow this wickedness
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:50.840]  to go on while they come after platforms like GAB where we have millions of Christians
[2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:55.840]  that are just sharing gospel messages, sharing Bible verses, sharing alternative news and
[2:20:55.840 --> 2:20:58.760]  information that they don't want other people to see.
[2:20:58.760 --> 2:20:59.760]  Exactly.
[2:20:59.760 --> 2:21:00.760]  That's the medicine to the evil.
[2:21:00.760 --> 2:21:01.760]  That's why they want to shut down.
[2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:05.480]  I would just say this, I've been interviewing you for five years since you launched GAB.
[2:21:05.480 --> 2:21:06.480]  You've always been well-spoken.
[2:21:06.480 --> 2:21:10.640]  You're always a great guest, but you're on fire right now and it's not just you.
[2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:14.600]  Every guest I've had on for many years is even like five times more well-spoken and incredible
[2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:15.600]  now.
[2:21:15.600 --> 2:21:18.440]  I'm seeing a quickening as the evil accelerates.
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:19.440]  Are you not seeing?
[2:21:19.440 --> 2:21:20.680]  I mean, I'm not kissing your ass.
[2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:21.680]  It's true.
[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:22.680]  You're really well-spoken.
[2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:23.680]  You're powerful.
[2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:25.280]  You're stronger than ever.
[2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:27.360]  Has this persecution not made you stronger?
[2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:28.360]  What do you think is happening?
[2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:29.360]  Yeah, Alex.
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:31.360]  Listen, I think the Holy Spirit is at work.
[2:21:31.360 --> 2:21:33.720]  I take no credit for anything that I've built.
[2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:36.440]  I take no credit for any of the words that I'm saying here today or any of the words
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:37.880]  that I've said in the past.
[2:21:37.880 --> 2:21:39.040]  It's all the Holy Spirit.
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:41.320]  It's all God speaking through me.
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:43.000]  All the glory goes to Him.
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.480]  I think that a lot of people are waking up right now.
[2:21:45.480 --> 2:21:47.160]  A lot of people are getting closer to God.
[2:21:47.160 --> 2:21:51.160]  I was driving up the driveway the other day and my neighbor stopped me and she said, your
[2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:52.680]  message is really resonating with me.
[2:21:52.680 --> 2:21:54.280]  I think I'm going to start going back to church.
[2:21:54.280 --> 2:21:55.960]  I've been praying more.
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:21:57.200]  This is what this country needs.
[2:21:57.200 --> 2:22:01.200]  The second that we stepped away from God, the second that we stopped proclaiming Jesus
[2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:04.680]  Christ as Lord and Savior is when this country started going downhill.
[2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:06.160]  We need a spiritual awakening.
[2:22:06.160 --> 2:22:08.720]  We need a spiritual revival in this country.
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:12.920]  If I could do some small part in that as a part of God's plan, that's what I'm going
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:13.920]  to do.
[2:22:13.920 --> 2:22:16.920]  I'm going to glorify Him each and every day and all that I do.
[2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:17.920]  You just said it.
[2:22:17.920 --> 2:22:18.920]  It brings tears to my eyes.
[2:22:18.920 --> 2:22:19.920]  This is a fight between good and evil.
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:20.920]  I know you've always been a Christian.
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:21.920]  You're a father.
[2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:27.080]  I guess it was the enemy coming against you, even closer to God, didn't it?
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:28.920]  I clung to that cross, Alex.
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:33.400]  The persecution just forced me into his hands, which is, I think, where he wanted me to be
[2:22:33.400 --> 2:22:38.080]  and where we all need to be, and the only reason I survived is because of him.
[2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:39.080]  That's right.
[2:22:39.080 --> 2:22:40.920]  Here's the good news.
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:42.080]  God is there with the arms open.
[2:22:42.080 --> 2:22:44.520]  The bad news is we're going to get pushed in his arms, but it's okay.
[2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:45.640]  It's going to get so intense.
[2:22:45.640 --> 2:22:48.800]  He'll be right back with the founder of God.
[2:22:48.800 --> 2:22:55.400]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government, but world government
[2:22:55.400 --> 2:22:57.800]  is only the control grid.
[2:22:57.800 --> 2:23:03.760]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:09.320]  and attain immortality, but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:12.440]  of all carbon-based line forms.
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:14.560]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[2:23:14.560 --> 2:23:18.280]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[2:23:18.280 --> 2:23:20.160]  They are playing God.
[2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:26.920]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:29.920]  to carry out this transformation.
[2:23:29.920 --> 2:23:34.280]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalists, it's all on
[2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:35.360]  record.
[2:23:35.360 --> 2:23:37.800]  You have been warned.
[2:23:37.800 --> 2:23:42.280]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:45.920]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:49.640]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[2:23:49.640 --> 2:23:52.720]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:23:52.720 --> 2:23:56.560]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[2:23:56.560 --> 2:23:57.560]  pass.
[2:23:57.560 --> 2:24:01.120]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:05.320]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[2:24:05.320 --> 2:24:06.320]  totally enslaved.
[2:24:06.320 --> 2:24:10.120]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[2:24:10.120 --> 2:24:11.120]  that move.
[2:24:11.120 --> 2:24:15.120]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:20.800]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:25.720]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:31.400]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[2:24:31.400 --> 2:24:36.000]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:55.040]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:59.680]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:05.480]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:11.520]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:16.200]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're
[2:25:16.200 --> 2:25:20.720]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:25.040]  of your life, your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:26.040]  of music.
[2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:30.880]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:34.240]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:38.320]  So don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:43.280]  the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your
[2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:52.160]  consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:26:19.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:24.880]  It's really about the big corrupt companies, the big corrupt apples of the slave camps
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:28.080]  of China lecturing us from Black Lives Matter.
[2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:31.600]  The Nike comes out against slave camps, which says you get trouble for now.
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:32.600]  They're the bad guy.
[2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:36.400]  That's in the stack of news I've got Andrew Torbo.
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:40.280]  You are really, we always have guests that are on fire, but you're really on fire.
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:43.840]  So I've got a lot of questions, a lot of points, but what else is the head of gab the founder
[2:26:43.840 --> 2:26:45.200]  of it five years?
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:46.200]  How'd you predict this?
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:47.200]  How'd you know?
[2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:50.720]  What do you think's coming next?
[2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:58.600]  So I think I was blessed by the Holy Spirit to have the foresight five years ago to know
[2:26:58.600 --> 2:27:03.080]  where this was going because I was living and working in Silicon Valley and I knew how these
[2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:07.640]  people thought and I had a lot of close relationships inside a lot of these companies and people
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:10.840]  were telling me like, hey, this is going to get much worse.
[2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:15.680]  So I had the foresight to build what I call a digital Noah's Ark.
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:21.840]  And then I think God put us through a trial in 2018 when we were really systematically
[2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:27.080]  no platform from everything, app stores, hosting providers, payment processors.
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:30.720]  The business was reduced to ash.
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:36.640]  We almost closed several times, but we kept pushing forward and we found a way and God
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:41.680]  took that ash and allowed us to bloom into what we've become today.
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:47.240]  So where this is going next and I have been thinking about this a lot is I really feel
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:51.200]  like they are going to try to solidify big text dominance.
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:56.960]  We see, you know, in Congress today, you know, all the big tech oligarchs being grilled
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:01.840]  by Congress grilled quote unquote, it's all just a dog and pony show.
[2:28:01.840 --> 2:28:06.400]  So they're going to push for some sort of regulation that locks in their power and their
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:08.440]  control over the internet.
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:11.960]  And we're going to fight back against that in every way that we can, but I think maybe
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:14.440]  they'll also try to censor at the browser level.
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:19.880]  So Google Chrome can very easily ship an update to all Google Chrome browsers that when you
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:24.560]  type in info wars.com or when you type in gab.com, you're just not allowed to access
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:25.560]  it anymore.
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:30.800]  So we're already thinking ahead of where their next step is going to be in terms of the censorship.
[2:28:30.800 --> 2:28:31.800]  And you're right.
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:33.040]  They've said it's browser level.
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:37.320]  You know, when the ADL calls for your arrest, I mean, Cohen calls for the arrest of Zuckerberg.
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:41.240]  I mean, it's like, it's still like, I've been going, these are Nazis, put them in jail.
[2:28:41.240 --> 2:28:43.880]  And you're like, these are Nazis saying this.
[2:28:43.880 --> 2:28:44.880]  It's so monstrous.
[2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:50.000]  So folks for people that aren't gab or info wars are thinking, oh, I'm not the target folks.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  They're coming after you.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:52.400]  They just got to get through us.
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:53.400]  Yeah.
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:54.400]  It's not even us.
[2:28:54.400 --> 2:28:55.400]  Right.
[2:28:55.400 --> 2:28:56.400]  They're not even coming after us.
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:28:59.560]  They're actually coming after the millions of people that are on gab or that tune into
[2:28:59.560 --> 2:29:00.560]  info wars.
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:01.880]  That's what they're afraid of.
[2:29:01.880 --> 2:29:04.280]  They're not afraid of Andrew Torba or about Jones.
[2:29:04.280 --> 2:29:08.320]  What they're afraid of is the millions of people that are tuning in and waking up to
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:11.840]  the thing that you've got a video feature where people can shoot their own videos that
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:13.160]  show it really happened.
[2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:14.160]  They're afraid of truth.
[2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:17.800]  They're afraid of the humans having access to reality.
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:18.800]  Exactly.
[2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:24.000]  You know, Proverbs 28 one tells us that the righteous are as bold as a lion.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:29.320]  We are commanded biblically to speak boldly, to speak the truth boldly.
[2:29:29.320 --> 2:29:32.560]  And I think too many Christians are afraid to do that.
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:36.000]  They cower in fear as long as it's not impacting me.
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:39.960]  I don't have to worry about it, but it is impacting you and it's going to start impacting
[2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:40.960]  you.
[2:29:40.960 --> 2:29:42.560]  They're going to start coming after churches.
[2:29:42.560 --> 2:29:44.560]  They're going to start coming after Christian organizations.
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:46.320]  Hell, look at the lockdown.
[2:29:46.320 --> 2:29:47.320]  Everything else can be open.
[2:29:47.320 --> 2:29:48.320]  Exactly.
[2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:51.480]  The Coplas bar is not the church.
[2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:52.480]  That's a big part of it.
[2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:53.840]  But it's going to go beyond that, Alex.
[2:29:53.840 --> 2:29:57.320]  They're going to start attacking the churches just and any Christian organization.
[2:29:57.320 --> 2:30:00.360]  Hell, the left are already burning them down all over the country.
[2:30:00.360 --> 2:30:05.160]  Yep, a Bible, any Bible based church, any Bible based Christian organization is going
[2:30:05.160 --> 2:30:10.440]  to face the same level of deep platforming and financial attacks that gap has faced over
[2:30:10.440 --> 2:30:11.440]  the past five years.
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:14.680]  We are really the guinea pig for where this is going.
[2:30:14.680 --> 2:30:16.520]  So why would the left take Christians so much?
[2:30:16.520 --> 2:30:20.000]  I guess they metaphysically know we're going to oppose their takeover.
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:22.440]  Well, it's real simple, Alex.
[2:30:22.440 --> 2:30:27.840]  Communism wants you to worship the state as God and God, actual God and Jesus Christ gets
[2:30:27.840 --> 2:30:28.840]  in the way of that.
[2:30:28.840 --> 2:30:33.480]  But Communism historically always comes for the Christians first because the Christians
[2:30:33.480 --> 2:30:39.200]  are actually worshiping God Almighty instead of worshiping the state and instead of worshiping
[2:30:39.200 --> 2:30:44.120]  all of these false idols, whether it's celebrities or sports stars or any number of things.
[2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:45.120]  And that's how it works.
[2:30:45.120 --> 2:30:46.720]  We're bringing God's will to the earth.
[2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:50.640]  They can't have their satanic will as long as we're bringing God in.
[2:30:50.640 --> 2:30:51.640]  Absolutely.
[2:30:51.640 --> 2:30:52.640]  Absolutely.
[2:30:52.640 --> 2:30:57.600]  I think there's so much taboo in our society and in our culture by design.
[2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:02.080]  The enemy has designed it this way around talking about things like Jesus Christ and
[2:31:02.080 --> 2:31:04.680]  God and angels and demons.
[2:31:04.680 --> 2:31:06.560]  These things are very real.
[2:31:06.560 --> 2:31:09.200]  Spiritual warfare is a very real thing.
[2:31:09.200 --> 2:31:16.720]  And our secular humanist society has all but disregarded God with Nietzsche's neilism
[2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:23.000]  and all this chaos of degeneracy that is allowed to be promoted to our children.
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:27.640]  What we need to do with this movement, this MAGA movement or this American populist movement,
[2:31:27.640 --> 2:31:28.960]  is we need to localize it.
[2:31:28.960 --> 2:31:35.240]  So we need 10,000 Donald Trumps in every town, on every city council, on every school board,
[2:31:35.240 --> 2:31:36.760]  in every mayorship.
[2:31:36.760 --> 2:31:40.680]  That's how we're going to take this country back is by localizing this movement and taking
[2:31:40.680 --> 2:31:42.240]  our own backyards back first.
[2:31:42.240 --> 2:31:46.120]  And for those that don't know, BLM can riot, and even kill.
[2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:51.200]  When Christians in America or Canada in the leftist areas peacefully pray they are arrested
[2:31:51.200 --> 2:31:52.320]  by the police.
[2:31:52.320 --> 2:31:53.960]  This is outrageous.
[2:31:53.960 --> 2:31:54.960]  This is criminal.
[2:31:54.960 --> 2:31:56.280]  We're showing it right now.
[2:31:56.280 --> 2:32:00.400]  Yeah, this video is for out of Moscow, Idaho, where we had Christians.
[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:05.080]  This is a Christian pastor who's being taken away for peacefully protesting in the streets.
[2:32:05.080 --> 2:32:10.160]  Now, again, you make a great point, BLM can burn down half the country all summer and destroy
[2:32:10.160 --> 2:32:14.160]  things and go massless in mass crowds and all this stuff.
[2:32:14.160 --> 2:32:18.240]  But the second that Christians stand up, the second that Christians start fighting back
[2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:23.240]  against this chaos that's going on in this world, they're immediately shut out.
[2:32:23.240 --> 2:32:25.560]  Not only show that crowd, they're mainly white.
[2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:28.800]  But I look at Christians who are Hispanic, black, you name it, they don't look like their
[2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:29.800]  soul was sucked.
[2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:30.800]  They look strong.
[2:32:30.800 --> 2:32:31.800]  They look virile.
[2:32:31.800 --> 2:32:33.520]  Show that crowd of good-looking Christians.
[2:32:33.520 --> 2:32:37.960]  And I'm not being mean here, but I went to Skull and Bones and covered the leftist at Yale.
[2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:40.240]  They looked like their souls were sucked.
[2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:42.960]  They were black, they were white, they looked dead.
[2:32:42.960 --> 2:32:43.960]  Absolutely.
[2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:47.240]  You look in their eyes, it's the eyes of the windows to the soul, Alex.
[2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:51.760]  You look in my eyes of these people, and they sold their soul to the devil.
[2:32:51.760 --> 2:32:56.520]  They are enslaved to sin, they're enslaved to the world, and they've chosen darkness
[2:32:56.520 --> 2:32:57.520]  over light.
[2:32:57.520 --> 2:33:00.960]  And the only thing that we could do at this point is to pray for them and to minister to
[2:33:00.960 --> 2:33:03.000]  them and to show them the other side.
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:05.800]  I think God is doing some tremendous things.
[2:33:05.800 --> 2:33:10.120]  In our church, we're having a baptism on Palm Sunday.
[2:33:10.120 --> 2:33:14.960]  And one of the testimonies that I listened to this week during a trial run was of a man
[2:33:14.960 --> 2:33:21.520]  who was consumed with nihilism and consumed with atheism and had treated Christians very
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:22.520]  horribly.
[2:33:22.520 --> 2:33:27.120]  And over the past year with this lockdown, he started learning about God and watching
[2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:28.120]  sermons.
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:33.480]  And God sent a woman into his life to introduce a different side of Christianity that he hadn't
[2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:34.600]  seen before.
[2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:39.800]  And now he's proclaiming his love for Jesus Christ in the form of baptism in front of
[2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:41.080]  a public room.
[2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:43.760]  So God is doing tremendous things like this.
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:44.760]  It's the key.
[2:33:44.760 --> 2:33:45.760]  The enemy is in trouble.
[2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:47.360]  That's why they're doing all this.
[2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:48.360]  Absolutely.
[2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:49.360]  Yeah.
[2:33:49.360 --> 2:33:50.800]  And that's why they're trying to shut up Christians.
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:53.880]  That's why they're punishing Christians and demonizing Christians.
[2:33:53.880 --> 2:33:59.880]  We see that they're calling out Christian nationalism and painting us like as if we're ISIS members
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:00.880]  of ISIS.
[2:34:00.880 --> 2:34:04.800]  Because we stand in the way of their sacrament, the destruction of children's lives.
[2:34:04.800 --> 2:34:05.800]  We do.
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:06.800]  We do.
[2:34:06.800 --> 2:34:07.800]  Yeah.
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:08.800]  That's what abortion is about.
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:10.560]  That's what this child exploitation is about.
[2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:11.560]  It's satanic.
[2:34:11.560 --> 2:34:12.560]  It's demonic.
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:13.560]  It's wickedness.
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:16.040]  I'm going to ask you this because I know you can feel the power.
[2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:20.640]  I actually am scared for the globalists because as their evil rises, I feel the Holy Spirit
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:22.280]  rises even more.
[2:34:22.280 --> 2:34:26.840]  I mean, the power now coming out of God is getting so intense every day.
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:28.000]  I can't even handle it.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:30.040]  I wonder what this is going to be like in a year or two, brother.
[2:34:30.040 --> 2:34:31.040]  This is incredible.
[2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:32.040]  It's good.
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:35.280]  I, I, I, I, again, I've never been more optimistic.
[2:34:35.280 --> 2:34:38.240]  We serve brother, the creator of the universe.
[2:34:38.240 --> 2:34:40.680]  Who that whom men shall I fear?
[2:34:40.680 --> 2:34:44.480]  Right, the oligarchs, another man.
[2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:48.840]  And when you have, when you have somebody who recognizes this, who, who has nothing
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:55.720]  to lose and who worships God and puts, humbly puts their faith in God, amazing thing, amazing
[2:34:55.720 --> 2:34:56.720]  things happen.
[2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:00.720]  And God has a way of using ordinary people to do extraordinary things.
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:02.240]  You know, Alex, I don't come from money.
[2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:04.240]  I don't come from status.
[2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:09.040]  You know, I, I live on a farm in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania and God is doing
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:12.760]  tremendous things with my life and through my life.
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:17.320]  And I think he's going to work on many other people in the same way and use them to accomplish
[2:35:17.320 --> 2:35:18.480]  his will.
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:19.640]  And we're going to continue fighting.
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:20.640]  We're not going to stop.
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:21.640]  That's right.
[2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:22.640]  Stay there.
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:23.640]  Final segment.
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:24.640]  You are ticking, but we love it.
[2:35:24.640 --> 2:35:25.640]  Andrew Torba of GAB.
[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:29.720]  It is a revolutionary act against this demonic system to spread it, GAB.com.
[2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:32.560]  Become a member, set up, start posting articles, videos, you name it.
[2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:36.280]  And please support him for wars there as well, because we are under passive attack, which
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:40.240]  I only see as proof of the fact we're over the target.
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:47.840]  I rejoice in our persecution because we are never going to surrender.
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:52.080]  Alex Jones here with the new info or sale, and it is a fantastic sale.
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:56.160]  It is many of our best selling products that just so happened to also be selling out.

[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:04.880]  Again, all of these are selling out except for brain force.
[2:36:04.880 --> 2:36:06.560]  They finally came back in the stock.
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:07.560]  It's amazing.
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:09.240]  It's 50% off and free shipping.

[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:32.080]  a whole host of products.
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:36.120]  The entire Immersed Essentials line is close to selling out and we're coming in a few months.
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:41.880]  But despite that, right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're all 50% off as well with free shipping.
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:45.880]  Just follow the banners at infowarsstore.com to huge savings, and it funds the info war,
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:48.880]  a 360 win.
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:52.960]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:54.000]  of the two.
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:57.040]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:02.480]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture,
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:06.080]  and ingenuity, art, and skill, and strength.
[2:37:06.080 --> 2:37:11.360]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:12.360]  it.
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:17.600]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:20.120]  of total mass high-tech slavery.
[2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:24.160]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:27.960]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:28.960]  masters.
[2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:32.960]  A global permanent lockdown is here that is already causing millions and millions of
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:34.200]  starve to death.
[2:37:34.200 --> 2:37:36.400]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:40.040]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England, Antitop General, have come out
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:44.280]  and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[2:37:44.280 --> 2:37:45.280]  That's the facts.
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:49.080]  This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:53.560]  As you know, we're always upping our game at info wars, and we brought you a new supplement,
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:57.120]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:37:58.200]  It is down and out.
[2:37:58.200 --> 2:38:00.000]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:03.040]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:06.080]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:08.640]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:12.320]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:17.280]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:19.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:22.960]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:23.960]  It's liquid.
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:24.960]  So it goes right to your body fast.
[2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:29.080]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off the sleep?
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:30.080]  It's incredible.
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:32.280]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:34.840]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[2:38:45.440 --> 2:38:53.920]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:55.640]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:57.960]  Really they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[2:38:57.960 --> 2:39:02.160]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:07.800]  Comps especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:11.680]  to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data.
[2:39:11.680 --> 2:39:16.280]  They can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:22.800]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:24.240]  In their own words, they admit it.
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:28.160]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:29.160]  a decade.
[2:39:29.160 --> 2:39:31.120]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[2:39:31.120 --> 2:39:32.120]  They're faraday cages.
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:33.880]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[2:39:33.880 --> 2:39:35.880]  They work absolutely great.
[2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:40.880]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:43.880]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:44.880]  it's another business.
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:51.640]  Get yours at M4store.com today.
[2:39:51.640 --> 2:40:21.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:26.200]  I've got a whole stack of news right here dealing with that.
[2:40:26.200 --> 2:40:31.480]  They are announcing that men can be in women's sports that's already happening.
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:37.280]  They are announcing they're going to have government funding to sterilize little boys.
[2:40:37.280 --> 2:40:39.560]  This is just purely, purely satanic.
[2:40:39.560 --> 2:40:45.680]  So in the censorship battle, I agree, you're right, big tech's going to try to really affirm
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:48.320]  its control and its dominance.
[2:40:48.320 --> 2:40:49.320]  How does it do that next?
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:53.720]  I mean, I think going against the general public, the Federal Reserve had was in a congressional
[2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:58.760]  hearing two days ago and said, oh, big banks use surveil people's purchases and punish
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:40:59.760]  them.
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:02.840]  So I mean, I think that's where this is going.
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:04.240]  This is already happening, Alex.
[2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:11.560]  We saw Bank of America after January 6th hand over any transaction from the D.C. area.
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:17.880]  So if you bought a coffee in D.C. at a Starbucks or something on that day, your data was handed
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:21.120]  over to the feds without a warrant from Bank of America.
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:24.760]  So what we're going to have to do, and I want to talk about solutions.
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:25.760]  I don't want to fear monger.
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:27.320]  I want to, because it's going to get bad.
[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:28.520]  We already know it's going to get bad.
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:29.960]  It's already bad right now.
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:31.200]  Let's talk about solutions.
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:35.080]  So the solution is a silent secession.
[2:41:35.080 --> 2:41:37.480]  Maybe that secession will turn geographic.
[2:41:37.480 --> 2:41:39.440]  Maybe we'll see a bunch of states pop off.
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:42.160]  I don't know what's going to happen on that end, but we need to start somewhere.
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:44.520]  We need to build our own economy.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:47.280]  It's not just building our own social network anymore.
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:48.880]  We need Christian banks.
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:53.040]  We need Christian restaurants, because now what we're seeing with this vaccine stuff
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:57.560]  is they're not going to allow you to go into a restaurant or to go to the grocery store
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:41:58.840]  if you're not vaccinated.
[2:41:58.840 --> 2:42:04.200]  So we're going to need Christian business owners to stand up and to fight back against
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:08.960]  this and to essentially build our own parallel economy in this country.
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:15.160]  And that's one of the things that we're working on next at GAB is how do we empower this digital
[2:42:15.160 --> 2:42:16.560]  side of this economy?
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:21.720]  How do we help people on GAB buy and exchange goods and services with one another so that
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:28.040]  they can go around the oligarchs, you know, Fortune 500 economy and, you know, barter
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:31.440]  and trade and do things the old fashioned way with one another?
[2:42:31.440 --> 2:42:33.080]  I think that also in terms of-
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:34.560]  Oh, you're totally right.
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:39.240]  That's where it's all going, is isolating everybody, social control, inoculations to
[2:42:39.240 --> 2:42:40.240]  buy and sell.
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:43.760]  So the whole future, even if you weren't a Christian, doing it because your spirit tells
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:44.960]  you for humanity.
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:48.880]  If you were a sociopath and not a globalist, the whole future is going to be communities
[2:42:48.880 --> 2:42:53.800]  that are like beyond the Amish, beyond the Orthodox Jews who already got it right, who
[2:42:53.800 --> 2:42:58.080]  they're attacking or ultra-Orthodox, it's their own communities.
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:03.000]  We have to start moving in that exodus because things will get so bad in this extermination
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:07.720]  plan that that's where it will go, so we should pre-position now.
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:09.000]  That's exactly what we need to do.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:13.520]  We need to start building our own communities that are grounded in, you know, the original
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:19.200]  vision of this country and what the Constitution says, and all of that stuff, of course, is
[2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:24.840]  grounded in biblical truth and in biblical liberty and in biblical spiritual freedom
[2:43:24.840 --> 2:43:28.200]  that comes to us only from God.
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:33.680]  One of the things that I am really pushing for right now is we need to focus more on
[2:43:33.680 --> 2:43:34.960]  our local politics.
[2:43:34.960 --> 2:43:40.320]  A lot of us are so enamored, are so consumed with national politics on what's going on
[2:43:40.320 --> 2:43:45.800]  in Washington, D.C., that we forget or neglect what's going on in our own backyard.
[2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:49.440]  I would guarantee you that many of the people listening right now probably don't even know
[2:43:49.440 --> 2:43:51.640]  who sits on their city council.
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:52.840]  That's a problem.
[2:43:52.840 --> 2:43:57.520]  That's how we got to the point where we see drag queen story hour in our local library
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:03.320]  because the enemy has not only taken control of D.C. and the national level of politics,
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:05.800]  but they've also taken control of our own backyard.
[2:44:05.800 --> 2:44:11.560]  And let me agree with you because if you launch a national, international, social network
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:15.840]  only, you know, gab could do that five years ago, most people couldn't have the technical
[2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:16.840]  skill to do it.
[2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:20.520]  But if people launch a local news site about local community and just let people post with
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:25.080]  a message board, those go wildly popular, put up stickers, go to city council, tell
[2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:26.080]  folks about it.
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:33.360]  Suddenly, you literally form a local pro-human, pro-God, pro-basic common sense anti-racist
[2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:35.920]  against the left with a real racist organization.
[2:44:35.920 --> 2:44:36.920]  It's so easy.
[2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:38.680]  I did it 27 years ago.
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:41.760]  People have to realize local is the power.
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:42.960]  Absolutely.
[2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:48.480]  We need to start in our own backyards and we need to seize control back of our local communities.
[2:44:48.480 --> 2:44:52.760]  Once we have control of our local communities, we can take back control of our local counties
[2:44:52.760 --> 2:44:55.440]  and then our state and then this country.
[2:44:55.440 --> 2:44:57.480]  We're focused way too much right now.
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:45:02.520]  All of our political energy is focused way too much on the day to day nuance of chaos
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:03.520]  that is happening in D.C.
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:08.440]  Instead of just having a garden, spending time with our children, loving God, loving
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:13.520]  our neighbors, that will turn back the tide of depression and Satanism and evil.
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:14.520]  Absolutely.
[2:45:14.520 --> 2:45:20.400]  I firmly believe that if even 25% of this country cut the cable cord and stopped watching
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:24.040]  CNN and stopped, by the way, Fox News too, stopped watching both of them.
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:25.200]  Just turn it off.
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:26.200]  Turn it off.
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:27.440]  Go outside with your kids.
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:29.000]  Spend time with your family.
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  Spend more time in church.
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:33.640]  We have to really think about and consider where we're spending our time.
[2:45:33.640 --> 2:45:38.080]  There are so many people in this country that get home after a long day at work and plop
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:42.640]  on the couch and turn on the TV and watch the news until they go to bed at 11 o'clock
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:43.640]  at night.
[2:45:43.640 --> 2:45:44.640]  Let's be clear.
[2:45:44.640 --> 2:45:46.280]  That's when you're tired and very suggestible.
[2:45:46.280 --> 2:45:47.280]  Exactly.
[2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:49.880]  What is on the news?
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:53.480]  The world is burning down and everything is the end of the world.
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:54.560]  It's fear mongering.
[2:45:54.560 --> 2:45:56.040]  It's fear porn.
[2:45:56.040 --> 2:46:00.640]  When you eliminate that from your life and you supplement that stuff with, maybe you
[2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:05.160]  go to church on Wednesday night, maybe you go volunteer at the soup kitchen, maybe you
[2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:07.360]  take your kids out to the park.
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:08.960]  Do real life things.
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:14.320]  Be an actual human being instead of being this cog that sits there absorbing this fear
[2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:19.880]  porn from CNN and, by the way, in Fox News and others all day long when you come home
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:21.440]  after a hard day at work.
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:23.680]  We need to start actually living and being...
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:28.000]  No, I agree because I mean well and we've done good work overall, but I end up focusing
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:31.600]  like Nietzsche said, you stare in the abyss, you become the abyss.
[2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:34.400]  That's what God's been telling me is, cover what the enemy's doing but don't give it so
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:35.400]  much power.
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:37.480]  Talk about the good, magnify it.
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:39.640]  That's what people are looking for.
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:41.440]  There's a lot of good that's going on, Alex.
[2:46:41.440 --> 2:46:47.240]  Like I said, that testimony in church from this former atheist, this guy who used to
[2:46:47.240 --> 2:46:51.600]  criticize and demonize Christians is now becoming a Christian.
[2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:56.720]  God can do tremendous things in the lives of individuals if they just spend some time
[2:46:56.720 --> 2:47:00.720]  praying and spend some time in the Word and spend some time surrounding yourself with
[2:47:00.720 --> 2:47:05.560]  other Christians and with other people that just see the madness that's going on.
[2:47:05.560 --> 2:47:10.120]  We have to start again just being human beings and focusing on the good stuff that's going
[2:47:10.120 --> 2:47:15.560]  on in this world instead of always focusing on the negative and the doom and gloom.
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:17.560]  You wonder why suicide rates are on the rise.
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:22.480]  You wonder why the opioid crisis is going on, why people are addicted to pornography,
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:26.840]  why people are addicted to gambling and all the ways of the world.
[2:47:26.840 --> 2:47:35.240]  It's because that is what is feeding people as some sort of comfort in this chaotic world
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:38.440]  that we're fed this fear porn all day and we just want to escape as them.
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:39.920]  We want to escape from it.
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:40.920]  Absolutely.
[2:47:40.920 --> 2:47:44.040]  Well, listen, Andrew Torba, you have blown me away again today more than ever.
[2:47:44.040 --> 2:47:45.040]  Great job at gab.com.
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:46.480]  We've got about a minute left.
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:47.480]  Please join the other shows.
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:48.600]  I know you're busy.
[2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:49.600]  Please come back on with us.
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:51.000]  We love everybody listening.
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  Go join gab.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  Go join info wars.
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:54.600]  Go join us on there.
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:55.600]  Join everybody.
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:47:56.720]  But just 60 seconds.
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:47:59.720]  Other key points you want to make?
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:00.720]  Return to God.
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:01.720]  Return to God.
[2:48:01.720 --> 2:48:02.720]  Keep the faith.
[2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:03.720]  Pray.
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:06.120]  If you haven't prayed in a long time, pray.
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:08.360]  Introduce other people to the gospel if you're a Christian.
[2:48:08.360 --> 2:48:12.360]  If not, maybe give Christianity a second look.
[2:48:12.360 --> 2:48:15.480]  Don't look at Christianity through the lens of what the world and through what culture
[2:48:15.480 --> 2:48:16.480]  tells us.
[2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:21.000]  Go and open the Bible for yourself and read God's word and read what he has to say.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  And I guarantee you it'll change your life.
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  Well, that's right.
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  God gave us free will.
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.520]  He also gave us a cheat sheet and it's incredible.
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:29.520]  And what was the term?
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:31.760]  It called it a silent exodus, a silent.
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:32.760]  A silent secession.
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:33.760]  A silent secession.
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:37.760]  And the other thing I would say is I want to encourage people to build.
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:38.760]  We need to build.
[2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:42.400]  We need to build our own alternative economy to this wicked economy.
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:43.400]  Because we are building.
[2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:45.400]  We're making God's image.
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:46.400]  We are.
[2:48:46.400 --> 2:48:47.400]  We are builders and we are reformers.
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:48.400]  Yes.
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:49.400]  Christians are not anarchists.
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:50.700]  We are not revolutionaries.
[2:48:50.700 --> 2:48:52.400]  We are reformers and we are builders.
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:53.640]  We do not destroy things.
[2:48:53.640 --> 2:48:54.760]  We build them up.
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:48:58.040]  And that's what we need to do right now is rebuild our civilization from the ash that
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:48:59.240]  it's currently sitting in.
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:00.240]  That's right.
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:02.520]  The enemy hates us because they are not builders.
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:03.520]  Absolutely.
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:05.280]  They're they're they're anarchists.
[2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:06.280]  They're destruction.
[2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:07.280]  They're evil.
[2:49:07.280 --> 2:49:08.480]  They're wicked.
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:13.400]  But you know, we have faith in and we have the creator of the universe on our side.
[2:49:13.400 --> 2:49:16.760]  Beautifully said, Andrew Corba, amazing and God is with him.
[2:49:16.760 --> 2:49:17.760]  Gabcom.
[2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:18.760]  All right.
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:19.760]  I've got.
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:20.760]  God bless Alex.
[2:49:20.760 --> 2:49:21.760]  Thank you, sir.
[2:49:21.760 --> 2:49:22.760]  God bless you and your family.
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:23.760]  Because you want to see him soon.
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:25.120]  Jason Jones is going to join us coming about 15 minutes.
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:26.120]  I've got other news.
[2:49:26.120 --> 2:49:27.120]  I got to add.
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:29.240]  I got to play some of these Biden clips from the press conference and I got some other
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:31.360]  stuff we got to do here.
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:34.680]  And also there's just a bunch of other things that have got to be hit.
[2:49:34.680 --> 2:49:38.440]  We had a lot of great guests today.
[2:49:38.440 --> 2:49:43.160]  Please realize your word of mouth in this fight is king.
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:44.400]  It's everything.
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:49.800]  And so if you promote gab.com, if you promote info wars.com, if you promote news wars.com,
[2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:52.640]  if you promote these sites, we will overcome the enemy.
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:56.320]  If you don't, it's going to be a lot worse and everything's foretold, we're going to
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:49:57.320]  go through it.
[2:49:57.320 --> 2:50:03.560]  But but God's already predestined what's going to happen, but we have free will.
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:07.920]  And that's a complex equation, but it's basically if there's an outcome, but there's a there's
[2:50:07.920 --> 2:50:10.360]  a spectrum of how it's going to end.
[2:50:10.360 --> 2:50:11.640]  And we have that free will.
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:13.320]  God's already predestined it.
[2:50:13.320 --> 2:50:14.320]  We were given free will.
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:15.320]  God already knows.
[2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:18.760]  But it's our decisions are going to decide where we are in that spectrum, where it's
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:21.560]  like six billion get killed or three billion get killed.
[2:50:21.560 --> 2:50:23.760]  I mean, it really is going to be spectacular.
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:24.760]  You're going to see everything.
[2:50:24.760 --> 2:50:29.000]  You're going to see combat robots on the street, mass assassinations, mass suicides.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:32.240]  You're going to see people jobs that arise out with the ice picks on TV.
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:37.840]  I mean, you'll see people eat babies on television.
[2:50:37.840 --> 2:50:45.880]  Emirates essentials is all natural, all organic, high end quality, clean self care products.

[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:39.960]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:40.960]  Go ahead.
[2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:41.960]  You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[2:51:41.960 --> 2:51:42.960]  Hey, Alex.
[2:51:42.960 --> 2:51:43.960]  Welcome.
[2:51:43.960 --> 2:51:48.360]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[2:51:48.360 --> 2:51:51.280]  wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year.
[2:51:51.280 --> 2:51:52.280]  Okay.
[2:51:52.280 --> 2:51:58.440]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[2:51:58.440 --> 2:51:59.960]  Living defense saved my life.
[2:51:59.960 --> 2:52:04.280]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:52:04.280 --> 2:52:05.720]  Living defense brought me back.
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:11.440]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:52:11.440 --> 2:52:13.880]  This is Matthew 24 verse nine.
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:20.320]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated
[2:52:20.320 --> 2:52:23.160]  of all nations for my name's sake.
[2:52:23.160 --> 2:52:28.960]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:52:28.960 --> 2:52:30.280]  Like where we're at brother.
[2:52:30.280 --> 2:52:34.720]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:42.600]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:53.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:52:53.440 --> 2:52:56.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I didn't watch it, but I've seen some of the clips.
[2:52:56.920 --> 2:53:00.360]  Biden's first press conference in two months was a disaster.
[2:53:00.360 --> 2:53:03.520]  The war room's coming up in an hour.
[2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:07.680]  Owen Schreuer is going to be playing the whole thing I'm told.
[2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:10.080]  So get ready for that.
[2:53:10.080 --> 2:53:11.080]  Wow.
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:17.280]  All right, I got sent this video this morning and it actually made me cry and not tears
[2:53:17.280 --> 2:53:18.280]  of joy.
[2:53:18.280 --> 2:53:23.760]  Like I was crying earlier listening to Andrew Jorba, but tears of pain.
[2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:24.760]  People thought the video was fake.
[2:53:24.760 --> 2:53:27.880]  I could tell it was real, the soy boy dad, the UK.
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:29.600]  They got Sony involved in it.
[2:53:29.600 --> 2:53:35.680]  And it's the song hallelujah turned to worshiping the poison vaccines, the mRNA that doesn't
[2:53:35.680 --> 2:53:36.680]  protect you.
[2:53:36.680 --> 2:53:38.240]  You still can't go out once you take it.
[2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:42.840]  But it's the left literally worshiping medical tyranny, their new sacrament.
[2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:47.520]  Here is the Marsh family in the UK.
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:48.520]  This is real.
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:51.240]  They're editing all the comments that don't like it on their YouTube.
[2:53:51.240 --> 2:54:00.160]  Here is the horror of the video I heard there was a rumor said that COVID vaccines were
[2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:09.920]  unproven or brewed to really sense and control you when it goes like this.
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:23.040]  What are some headlines about India?
[2:54:23.040 --> 2:54:35.920]  Have the new job, have the new job, have the new job, hallelujah, have the new job, hallelujah,
[2:54:35.920 --> 2:54:40.560]  have the new job, use your children for this.
[2:54:40.560 --> 2:54:44.560]  children for this. The less loves, take it over to the enemy.
[2:54:44.560 --> 2:54:50.560]  The night is strong and they've yielded proof. You won't cross scales or camels hoops. They
[2:54:50.560 --> 2:54:55.560]  Julie checked with fire and then approved them.
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:54:57.560]  That's right. It's not a play.
[2:54:57.560 --> 2:55:06.560]  It's a biological warfare. They broke all records for stills to catch. So please do not refuse
[2:55:06.560 --> 2:55:10.560]  to have the new job. It's not even approved to children.
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:15.560]  Have the new job. Hallelujah. Have the new job.
[2:55:15.560 --> 2:55:17.560]  He's going to look like a bondage to that father.
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:21.560]  Have the new job. Have the new job.
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:24.560]  He's a weak look in his eyes. He's mesmerized.
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:31.560]  Look at that father.
[2:55:31.560 --> 2:55:38.560]  Well, maybe we all get misled. We see this poster, our walls are threatened.
[2:55:38.560 --> 2:55:43.560]  They use conspiracy theories just to fool you.
[2:55:43.560 --> 2:55:45.560]  Yeah, like black men in Tuskegee.
[2:55:45.560 --> 2:55:49.560]  It's like needle pricks to be scared about you.
[2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:58.560]  The ones who birth is north and south. The sudden it's mistaken. Have the new job.
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:02.560]  Have the new job. Hallelujah.
[2:56:02.560 --> 2:56:06.560]  They literally worship Bill Gates.
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:11.560]  Have the new job. Have the new job.
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:17.560]  Hallelujah bells, palsy. Hallelujah cancer. Hallelujah death.
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:20.560]  Our daddy let us in the battle on.
[2:56:20.560 --> 2:56:24.560]  Maybe sacrifice your children. It's a pretty common thing.
[2:56:24.560 --> 2:56:29.560]  It's a great thrill.
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:34.560]  Don't do it all to prove their pharmacists.
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:40.560]  And it's not a trick. You can't use faith. It's not some strange.
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:44.560]  Oh, no.
[2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:49.560]  Have the new job.
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:53.560]  Have the new job.
[2:56:53.560 --> 2:56:56.560]  Have the new job.
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:56:59.560]  Have the new job.
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:02.560]  Have the new job.
[2:57:02.560 --> 2:57:05.560]  What heroes?
[2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:09.560]  Hitler was bad for his scripting children no more.
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:11.560]  Well, he's wearing the non-threatening trendy pants.
[2:57:11.560 --> 2:57:14.560]  Well, there are some times we make a choice.
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:18.560]  A personal view, a protest point.
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:23.560]  But other times we're part of something greater.
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:25.560]  My choice, but not now.
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:28.560]  So remember this ain't just for you.
[2:57:28.560 --> 2:57:30.560]  That's right. If you don't take your hurting others.
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:32.560]  Protecting others too.
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:37.560]  And every breath we save is Hallelujah.
[2:57:37.560 --> 2:57:39.560]  That's right. Bye-bye.
[2:57:39.560 --> 2:57:42.560]  Bye-bye, Marwa Swarman-Hangler.
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:46.560]  Bye-bye. Bye-bye, top baseball players that died.
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:50.560]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air.
[2:57:50.560 --> 2:57:53.560]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists.
[2:57:53.560 --> 2:57:57.560]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them.
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:58:00.560]  That we're poisoning them. That we're sterilizing them.
[2:58:00.560 --> 2:58:02.560]  Then they deserve to be killed.
[2:58:02.560 --> 2:58:05.560]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists. They play God.
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:09.560]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:13.560]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:17.560]  They tried to get me to join them. But metaphysically at a spiritual level,
[2:58:17.560 --> 2:58:20.560]  I have the Holy Spirit. I'm the connection with God.
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:23.560]  And I know that God does not like that. So I cannot join the enemy.
[2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:29.560]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[2:58:29.560 --> 2:58:32.560]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:36.560]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger,
[2:58:36.560 --> 2:58:38.560]  you're not God.
[2:58:38.560 --> 2:58:45.560]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the Universe doesn't like.
[2:58:45.560 --> 2:59:13.560]  That's a fact.
[2:59:13.560 --> 2:59:28.560]  I believe we should go back to a position of the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago.
[2:59:28.560 --> 2:59:32.560]  And that is that it used to be required for the filibuster.
[2:59:32.560 --> 2:59:34.560]  And I I had a card on this.
[2:59:34.560 --> 2:59:37.560]  I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them.
[2:59:37.560 --> 2:59:45.560]  That used to be that from between 1917 and 1971, the filibuster existed.
[2:59:45.560 --> 2:59:53.560]  There were a total of 58 motions to break the filibuster that whole time.
[2:59:53.560 --> 2:59:59.560]  Last year alone, there were five times that many.
[2:59:59.560 --> 3:00:02.560]  So it's being abused in a gigantic way.
[3:00:02.560 --> 3:00:10.560]  And, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed.
[3:00:10.560 --> 3:00:11.560]  And guess what?
[3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:14.560]  People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing.
[3:00:14.560 --> 3:00:18.560]  The filibusters broke down and were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum and vote.
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:22.560]  So I strongly support moving in that direction.
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:30.560]  In addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are just elemental to the function of our democracy,
[3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:34.560]  like the right to vote, like the basic right to vote.
[3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:37.560]  We've amended the filibuster in the past.
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:40.560]  But here's the deal.
[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:43.560]  As you observed, I'm a fairly practical guy.
[3:00:43.560 --> 3:00:46.560]  I want to get things done.
[3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:52.560]  I want to get them done consistent with what we promised the American people.
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:00:59.560]  And in order to do that in a 5050 Senate, we've got to get to the place where I get 50 votes
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:02.560]  so that the vice president of the United States can break the tie.
[3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:05.560]  Or I get 51 votes without her.
[3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:09.560]  And so I'm going to say something outrageous.
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:15.560]  I had never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate.
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:24.560]  So the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to...
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:30.560]  Anyway, we're ready to get a lot done.
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:35.560]  And if we have to, if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster,
[3:01:35.560 --> 3:01:58.560]  then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about.
[3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:06.560]  Back in the mid 20th century, major universities conducted studies like the Milgram and Stanford studies,
[3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:12.560]  where they tested their psychology departments how far they could push their students to commit crimes
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:16.560]  as long as authority figures were telling them to do so.
[3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:22.560]  And they found that in almost every case, 90 plus percent of people would follow orders from authority figures
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:26.560]  to even kill people in order to do so.
[3:02:26.560 --> 3:02:31.560]  That's why I parallel what's happening with the whole COVID rollout and the lockdowns
[3:02:31.560 --> 3:02:36.560]  and the nonsensical social distancing and the masks that don't work and the lies about the COVID deaths
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:42.560]  and the vaccine damages as a giant Milgram psychological experiment.
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:52.560]  That's what we're about to break down today, is in late March 2021, the level of absurdity has reached proportions
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:03:02.560]  never before seen in human history.
[3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:08.560]  The heartbreaking video you're seeing is a newborn baby in Europe wrapped in plastic
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:12.560]  to supposedly protect it from its mother so it can't touch its mother.
[3:03:12.560 --> 3:03:16.560]  Despite the fact that hundreds of studies show it's an initial contact with the mother
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:20.560]  that activates the life force of the child.
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:23.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a crime against humanity.
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:25.560]  This is a crime against our own biology.
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:30.560]  This is teaching us that we're dirty and evil and bad and that humanity is a disease on the planet.
[3:03:30.560 --> 3:03:35.560]  This is the cult of the global warming you Genesis left.
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:38.560]  The death cult is teaching us that we're evil.
[3:03:38.560 --> 3:03:40.560]  The death cult is teaching us we're bad.
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:45.560]  It doesn't matter if all the science shows more human contact gives us a better immune system
[3:03:45.560 --> 3:03:46.560]  and makes us healthy.
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:53.560]  They're teaching us all to be the boy in the bubble who couldn't be in contact with any germs or he died.
[3:03:53.560 --> 3:03:56.560]  That's a very, very, very rare genetic disorder.
[3:03:56.560 --> 3:04:01.560]  But if you're not around other microbes growing up, if you don't play around in the dirt when you're a baby
[3:04:01.560 --> 3:04:07.560]  and put it in your mouth, you don't develop an immune system and then you need the medical system for the rest of your life
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:12.560]  to give you constant drugs, constant antibiotics, constant inoculations to just keep you alive.
[3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:17.560]  We are witnessing a scientific dictatorship take control of the human family.
[3:04:17.560 --> 3:04:20.560]  We are witnessing the final revolution.
[3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:28.560]  The medical system is run by the most ruthless out of control corporations
[3:04:28.560 --> 3:04:31.560]  and they're simply testing to see what you will put up with.
[3:04:31.560 --> 3:04:33.560]  We've already submitted to abuse.
[3:04:33.560 --> 3:04:35.560]  We've already let them lock up our elders.
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:37.560]  We've already let them give us experimental vaccines.
[3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:42.560]  We've already let them shut down our schools and seen suicide and drug addiction explode.
[3:04:42.560 --> 3:04:47.560]  We've already seen children performing band practice in pods out of the body centers.
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:53.560]  We've already witnessed people wearing large donuts around them so they go into bars and restaurants.
[3:04:53.560 --> 3:04:54.560]  This is absurdity.
[3:04:54.560 --> 3:05:01.560]  That's what cults ask you to do, to do things that are ridiculous, to do things that are against common sense, to prove your submission.
[3:05:01.560 --> 3:05:05.560]  Klaus Schwab and other globalists admit this is not about COVID.
[3:05:05.560 --> 3:05:09.560]  It's about teaching you that humans are dirty and bad and we need to be exterminated.
[3:05:09.560 --> 3:05:13.560]  It's about teaching you that you're obsolete, that you are non-essential.
[3:05:23.560 --> 3:05:24.560]  We are witnessing mass mind control.
[3:05:24.560 --> 3:05:27.560]  We are witnessing the true chicken little scenario.
[3:05:27.560 --> 3:05:33.560]  We're psych warfare chiefs aided by big banks and the corporate media and government in the medical system
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:36.560]  are literally terrifying the public into total submission.
[3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:46.560]  Globalists want our children so they don't develop and touch God's face.
[3:05:46.560 --> 3:05:51.560]  We have Jason Jones coming in with some of the incredible career that's unfolding in studio in a moment.
[3:05:51.560 --> 3:05:52.560]  Here's part of the video.
[3:05:52.560 --> 3:05:55.560]  Texas man fights back against mask invokes God.
[3:05:55.560 --> 3:05:58.560]  This is posted at band.video.
[3:05:58.560 --> 3:06:00.560]  Here's Nino Rodriguez in Midland, Texas.
[3:06:00.560 --> 3:06:02.560]  All of us should be doing this.
[3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:03.560]  Oh, that's me.
[3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:19.560]  I want to first of all say that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[3:06:19.560 --> 3:06:22.560]  And he's the name of all names and every need.
[3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:24.560]  Like it or not.
[3:06:24.560 --> 3:06:25.560]  When's enough enough?
[3:06:25.560 --> 3:06:27.560]  How many masks do we want to wear here?
[3:06:27.560 --> 3:06:29.560]  10, 20, the whole box?
[3:06:29.560 --> 3:06:30.560]  What's next y'all?
[3:06:30.560 --> 3:06:35.560]  It's not even proven hasn't had clinical studies long term.
[3:06:35.560 --> 3:06:36.560]  What's next?
[3:06:36.560 --> 3:06:37.560]  Right?
[3:06:37.560 --> 3:06:42.560]  This man over here, this attorney from the MISD harassed me at the door of me and my son.
[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:44.560]  Is it because I'm a Hispanic minority?
[3:06:44.560 --> 3:06:46.560]  Or what's going on here?
[3:06:46.560 --> 3:06:47.560]  What do you want us to do, sir?
[3:06:47.560 --> 3:06:50.560]  Wear a star now because we don't want to wear a mask.
[3:06:50.560 --> 3:06:53.560]  You told me to stay away over here away from everybody else.
[3:06:53.560 --> 3:06:54.560]  I'm not a leper.
[3:06:54.560 --> 3:06:55.560]  I'm not sick.
[3:06:55.560 --> 3:06:56.560]  I've never been sick.
[3:06:56.560 --> 3:06:57.560]  I've got to report too.
[3:06:57.560 --> 3:06:58.560]  I've got to report.
[3:06:58.560 --> 3:07:00.560]  Me and my whole family have never worn a mask one time.
[3:07:00.560 --> 3:07:03.560]  The greatest president in the world, Donald Trump, invited me to the White House
[3:07:03.560 --> 3:07:06.560]  and I went to Washington, D.C., Dallas, Houston.
[3:07:06.560 --> 3:07:08.560]  I've been all across the nation, right?
[3:07:08.560 --> 3:07:09.560]  With no mask ever.
[3:07:09.560 --> 3:07:10.560]  I refuse to wear one.
[3:07:10.560 --> 3:07:11.560]  Amen?
[3:07:11.560 --> 3:07:12.560]  And I never got corona.
[3:07:12.560 --> 3:07:14.560]  None of my family has got coronavirus.
[3:07:14.560 --> 3:07:16.560]  Here's my report, right?
[3:07:16.560 --> 3:07:19.560]  No one knew my report because I didn't miss your reports with no kind of proof whatsoever.
[3:07:19.560 --> 3:07:20.560]  But here's my report.
[3:07:20.560 --> 3:07:21.560]  It's the truth.
[3:07:21.560 --> 3:07:22.560]  So help me God.
[3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:24.560]  Every person that I know, they got coronavirus.
[3:07:24.560 --> 3:07:25.560]  First of all, they survived.
[3:07:25.560 --> 3:07:30.560]  Second of all, they all wore a mask, a face diaper, breathing their hot breath all day.
[3:07:30.560 --> 3:07:33.560]  I've never worn a mask in my life and I've never been sick.
[3:07:33.560 --> 3:07:34.560]  Neither have you, son?
[3:07:34.560 --> 3:07:35.560]  Have you been sick?
[3:07:35.560 --> 3:07:36.560]  No.
[3:07:36.560 --> 3:07:37.560]  See?
[3:07:37.560 --> 3:07:38.560]  So we never worn a mask.
[3:07:38.560 --> 3:07:39.560]  We've never been sick.
[3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:42.560]  Yet you've got COVID carons, a mask police harassing.
[3:07:42.560 --> 3:07:46.560]  Like I said, the attorney here for AMISD harassing me and a bunch of patriots tell us we have
[3:07:46.560 --> 3:07:47.560]  to leave once we speak.
[3:07:47.560 --> 3:07:48.560]  I'm not a leper.
[3:07:48.560 --> 3:07:49.560]  I'm not sick.
[3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:50.560]  So again, what's next?
[3:07:50.560 --> 3:07:51.560]  And when's enough enough?
[3:07:51.560 --> 3:07:53.560]  Last time my check is the free country.
[3:07:53.560 --> 3:07:55.560]  Honestly, last time I checked, this is America.
[3:07:55.560 --> 3:07:56.560]  And you know what?
[3:07:56.560 --> 3:07:59.560]  My religious beliefs, why are they not accepted, right?
[3:07:59.560 --> 3:08:02.560]  I guess if I was BLM or LGBT, right?
[3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:05.560]  Or a pro-master, I guess everybody would love me a lot more.
[3:08:05.560 --> 3:08:09.560]  But since I'm an Hispanic minority with the Trump hat in the Jesus shirt, right?
[3:08:09.560 --> 3:08:12.560]  I get treated like so wickedly at the door.
[3:08:12.560 --> 3:08:15.560]  Basically, looking like the police want to arrest me for not wearing a mask.
[3:08:15.560 --> 3:08:19.560]  But thank God the governor had enough of this stuff and got rid of the mandate, which I
[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:22.560]  think AMISD needs to also, because I'm going to tell you something.
[3:08:22.560 --> 3:08:27.560]  Your safety and your well-being is your responsibility, not mine.
[3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:30.560]  And newsflash, everybody, one day we're all going to die.
[3:08:30.560 --> 3:08:33.560]  The Bible says we are promised death.
[3:08:33.560 --> 3:08:37.560]  So what you need to do is get right with God, universal.
[3:08:37.560 --> 3:08:38.560]  This is my point.
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:40.560]  Where's my religious freedom?
[3:08:40.560 --> 3:08:42.560]  Where's my civil rights to get violated?
[3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:43.560]  I'm a minority, right?
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:44.560]  I'm a victim.
[3:08:44.560 --> 3:08:45.560]  I've been a racist.
[3:08:45.560 --> 3:08:48.560]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:49.560]  It's very bittersweet.
[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:52.560]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:08:52.560 --> 3:08:54.560]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[3:08:54.560 --> 3:08:56.560]  I care about beating the new world border.
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:01.560]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:04.560]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:07.560]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[3:09:07.560 --> 3:09:09.560]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:11.560]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:09:11.560 --> 3:09:14.560]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[3:09:14.560 --> 3:09:15.560]  And then forwardstore.com.
[3:09:15.560 --> 3:09:18.560]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[3:09:18.560 --> 3:09:21.560]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[3:09:21.560 --> 3:09:22.560]  Do they fund freedom?
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:23.560]  No, a lot of them don't.
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:29.560]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[3:09:29.560 --> 3:09:31.560]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:09:31.560 --> 3:09:34.560]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:37.560]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:42.560]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[3:09:42.560 --> 3:09:45.560]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:09:45.560 --> 3:09:49.560]  Alex Jones here with the new info or sale and it is a fantastic sale.
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:53.560]  It is many of our best selling products that just so happened to also be selling out.

[3:09:59.560 --> 3:10:02.560]  Again, all of these are selling out except for Rainforest.
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:03.560]  It finally came back into stock.
[3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:04.560]  It's amazing.
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:06.560]  It's 50% off and free shipping.
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:11.560]  We've got the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the Cabochill, the Vaso Beats, the Alpha Power.

[3:10:21.560 --> 3:10:23.560]  And it funds our operation.

[3:10:28.560 --> 3:10:30.560]  a whole host of products.
[3:10:30.560 --> 3:10:33.560]  The entire emergency essentials line is close to selling out more coming in a few months.
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:39.560]  But despite that right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're all 50% off as well with free shipping.

[3:10:43.560 --> 3:10:45.560]  A 360 win.
[3:10:48.560 --> 3:10:51.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:02.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:02.560 --> 3:11:08.560]  And Jason Jones is an Army veteran, best selling author, produced a bunch of award winning films.
[3:11:08.560 --> 3:11:11.560]  I mean, big movies with a lot of big stars.
[3:11:11.560 --> 3:11:12.560]  And they're Christian.
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:16.560]  And boy, is that swimming against the tide successfully.
[3:11:16.560 --> 3:11:18.560]  It's one thing to swim against the tide, other things successfully.
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:20.560]  And he's welcome here anytime.
[3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:21.560]  He moved from Hawaii.
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:23.560]  It's been under martial law for a year.
[3:11:23.560 --> 3:11:30.560]  But there on Oahu, the most populous island, he sent me a video a few days ago of George Floyd level stuff.
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:36.560]  Women being tortured, having their necks kneeled on for not wearing masks, wearing masks.
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:39.560]  They don't care for trying to go out and demonstrate.
[3:11:39.560 --> 3:11:43.560]  We just showed you Idaho pastors being arrested for having outdoor church.
[3:11:43.560 --> 3:11:45.560]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:47.560]  This is satanic.
[3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:48.560]  This is so obvious.
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:51.560]  And look at them torturing that woman that didn't even resist them.
[3:11:51.560 --> 3:11:52.560]  Why do they single her out?
[3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:55.560]  This is just totally demonic.
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:11:56.560]  We're going to play this next segment.
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:04.560]  But Jason Jones of movie2movement.com, movie2movement.com, TheGreatCampaign.org.
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:06.560]  And of course, the host of the Jason Jones show.
[3:12:06.560 --> 3:12:08.560]  Great to see you again, my friend.
[3:12:08.560 --> 3:12:09.560]  It's good to see you.
[3:12:09.560 --> 3:12:12.560]  Saw Capital Deal on the 6th at all the events.
[3:12:12.560 --> 3:12:14.560]  You live just outside of Austin now.
[3:12:14.560 --> 3:12:16.560]  Wow, what the hell is going on in Hawaii?
[3:12:16.560 --> 3:12:17.560]  What a wonderful state.
[3:12:17.560 --> 3:12:18.560]  What wonderful people.
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:21.560]  Why has it been singled out to be as bad as Australia?
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:23.560]  Well, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:27.560]  Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii, they all have something in common.
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:29.560]  They're island communities.
[3:12:29.560 --> 3:12:30.560]  They can be abused.
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:33.560]  And what it lets us know is government will go as far as it can go.
[3:12:33.560 --> 3:12:35.560]  They'll take as much as they can take.
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:37.560]  In Texas, they can't take much, so they don't take much.
[3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:39.560]  And Hawaii was funny early on.
[3:12:39.560 --> 3:12:42.560]  They took everything from us, but you could fish and surf.
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:44.560]  They knew that they couldn't take that.
[3:12:44.560 --> 3:12:48.560]  So what we're seeing in Hawaii is that I was talking to business owners today.
[3:12:48.560 --> 3:12:50.560]  Is there any relief in sight?
[3:12:50.560 --> 3:12:53.560]  Is there any hope in sight that they're going to relax these restrictions?
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:12:55.560]  And they said they don't have any hope.
[3:12:55.560 --> 3:12:56.560]  But what you say is key.
[3:12:56.560 --> 3:13:00.560]  Thomas Jefferson was asked famously, what is the level of tyranny we will accept?
[3:13:00.560 --> 3:13:03.560]  Or what is the tyranny tyrants will attempt, he said, whatever you put up with.
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:06.560]  So stop submitting and only makes it worse.
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:08.560]  Yeah, well, in the public camera, you tell folks what's going on.
[3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:10.560]  Well, here's what's going on in Hawaii.
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:13.560]  And normal times, there are seven people on a mortgage.
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:16.560]  On normal times, everyone in the house has two jobs.
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:21.560]  You have aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, all living together, all working together.
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:23.560]  So people are vulnerable.
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:26.560]  They're not going to step out of line because it's not just about themselves.
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:28.560]  They're thinking about their mother.
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:29.560]  They're thinking about their grandmother, their grandfather.
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:31.560]  Their cousin, their niece.
[3:13:31.560 --> 3:13:33.560]  So they have a very tribal, very communal.
[3:13:33.560 --> 3:13:35.560]  It's a communal society, right?
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:37.560]  So everyone's taking care of everyone.
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:42.560]  So if you step out of line, everyone in your family is going to suffer.
[3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:44.560]  They know that they take advantage of this.
[3:13:44.560 --> 3:13:48.560]  And now if one person's working and three people are out of work,
[3:13:48.560 --> 3:13:50.560]  Hawaii was put under martial law by the U.S.
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:51.560]  It never got up.
[3:13:51.560 --> 3:13:52.560]  They banned them dancing.
[3:13:52.560 --> 3:13:54.560]  I mean, they've been under control forever.
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:57.560]  Well, look at this is what why is Hawaii food insecure today?
[3:13:57.560 --> 3:14:00.560]  Because plantation owners over through the Kingdom of Hawaii.
[3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:01.560]  This is what happened.
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:03.560]  A lot of my conservative friends don't want to hear it.
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:04.560]  This is exactly what happened.
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:06.560]  I said, give Hawaii back to the natives.
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:07.560]  Yeah.
[3:14:07.560 --> 3:14:12.560]  So plantation owners, ag industry over through the state, they made an ag state.
[3:14:12.560 --> 3:14:16.560]  They brought people in from all over the world, the Philippines, Okinawa, China.
[3:14:16.560 --> 3:14:19.560]  And then with GAT 94, they destroyed the ag industry.
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:24.560]  They said, no, you are no longer part of the agricultural global community.
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:26.560]  And so now 90% of food in Hawaii.
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:28.560]  The same thing as Jamaica.
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:33.560]  And now look, 90% of the food in Hawaii has to be imported.
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:36.560]  When I was a young man, Hawaii was an ag state.
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:39.560]  The most wonderful time of the year was the ag fair.
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:40.560]  It's an agriculture community.
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:42.560]  We were knit together through agriculture.
[3:14:42.560 --> 3:14:44.560]  They destroyed the agriculture community.
[3:14:44.560 --> 3:14:46.560]  They have made us food insecure.
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:48.560]  Hawaii is extremely vulnerable.
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:50.560]  We're 47.
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:52.560]  I'm sounding like President Obama.
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:54.560]  We're 47 out of 50 states with food security.
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:56.560]  It's going to increase by 50%.
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:14:59.560]  We're the furthest place in the world from any other place in the world.
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:04.560]  Right now there's a ship in the Suez Canal that's stopping all those ships going back and forth.
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:05.560]  All that trade.
[3:15:05.560 --> 3:15:07.560]  Well, Hawaii is extremely vulnerable.
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:09.560]  So I've been spending the past since I left in July.
[3:15:09.560 --> 3:15:10.560]  I came to Texas.
[3:15:10.560 --> 3:15:12.560]  I told my friends, I'm not leaving Hawaii.
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:13.560]  I'm deploying.
[3:15:13.560 --> 3:15:17.560]  And I'm deploying to work on a plan to make Hawaii food secure.
[3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:18.560]  That's been my focus.
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:19.560]  And we were.
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:25.560]  And again, any good governor or leader would want to make an island lock bread basket self-sufficient.
[3:15:25.560 --> 3:15:28.560]  You could be a net exporter like you used to be.
[3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:29.560]  I looked it up.
[3:15:29.560 --> 3:15:32.560]  Used to be an exporting beef, exporting coffee, exporting everything.
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:33.560]  Now, no.
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:34.560]  No offense, Texas.
[3:15:34.560 --> 3:15:36.560]  Hawaii had panellas.
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:38.560]  We had cowboys before you did.
[3:15:38.560 --> 3:15:39.560]  Look it up.
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:40.560]  This is true.
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:43.560]  And because they have the Spanish and Portuguese settling there.
[3:15:43.560 --> 3:15:48.560]  Well, they had to bring the Mexican cowboys in there because British Admiral gave King
[3:15:48.560 --> 3:15:50.560]  Kamehameha some cattle.
[3:15:50.560 --> 3:15:51.560]  They went out of control.
[3:15:51.560 --> 3:15:55.560]  And then by the middle of the 19th century, we had a booming cattle business.
[3:15:55.560 --> 3:15:57.560]  We had a booming industry.
[3:15:57.560 --> 3:15:58.560]  And so now what?
[3:15:58.560 --> 3:16:01.560]  Instead of they don't even talk about the big island mainly.
[3:16:01.560 --> 3:16:02.560]  That's the big island.
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:04.560]  Parker Ranch was the biggest active ranch in the world.
[3:16:04.560 --> 3:16:05.560]  I flew over to helicopter.
[3:16:05.560 --> 3:16:06.560]  Damn.
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:07.560]  That was a beautiful cows.
[3:16:07.560 --> 3:16:08.560]  I want to live in Hawaii.
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:09.560]  Much less a cow must love it.
[3:16:09.560 --> 3:16:10.560]  No.
[3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:11.560]  And you know, my heart breaks.
[3:16:11.560 --> 3:16:14.560]  But listen, the regime forms your soul.
[3:16:14.560 --> 3:16:17.560]  The type of government you live in forms you.
[3:16:17.560 --> 3:16:21.560]  Your culture industry formed the people of Hawaii, all the ethnicities, the cultures coming
[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:24.560]  together, mixed with the missionaries, the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[3:16:24.560 --> 3:16:27.560]  Well, now there's this tyranny that will form souls.
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:28.560]  That will form who we are.
[3:16:28.560 --> 3:16:32.560]  That's why I had to get my children out of there, but I haven't stopped fighting.
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:33.560]  So here we were next week.
[3:16:33.560 --> 3:16:34.560]  We're launching.
[3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:36.560]  So you're in Texas, but your spirit's still in Hawaii.
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:37.560]  I'm still fighting for Hawaii.
[3:16:37.560 --> 3:16:39.560]  And you know, we were going to launch.
[3:16:39.560 --> 3:16:40.560]  Believe me, brother.
[3:16:40.560 --> 3:16:41.560]  I was planning to move there.
[3:16:41.560 --> 3:16:43.560]  I knew it had problems at watching this.
[3:16:43.560 --> 3:16:44.560]  No.
[3:16:44.560 --> 3:16:45.560]  This is it's heartbreaking.
[3:16:45.560 --> 3:16:48.560]  We were going to launch next week Hawaii food security.com.
[3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:49.560]  Thanks to you.
[3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:50.560]  We're launching it right now.
[3:16:50.560 --> 3:16:52.560]  Go to Hawaii food security.com.
[3:16:52.560 --> 3:16:54.560]  That's what my focus has been on.
[3:16:54.560 --> 3:16:56.560]  A plan to make Hawaii food independent and food secure.
[3:16:56.560 --> 3:17:01.560]  And then last week I was drawn on Saturday I was driving back from Dallas where I was
[3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:07.560]  giving a speech to 500 people in Dallas, a blue city in a red state, but I got to speak
[3:17:07.560 --> 3:17:13.560]  to 500 people, signed autographs, shook hands, handed out books and movies, drove home.
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:15.560]  I was just feeling on top of the world.
[3:17:15.560 --> 3:17:21.560]  And I see a woman being brutalized by HPD going through what I went through a year ago.
[3:17:21.560 --> 3:17:22.560]  That's right.
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:23.560]  You got choked.
[3:17:23.560 --> 3:17:24.560]  You got arrested.
[3:17:24.560 --> 3:17:26.560]  Well, you know, I didn't get choked, but they arrested you.
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:27.560]  Well, they were grabbing at you.
[3:17:27.560 --> 3:17:28.560]  I remember.
[3:17:28.560 --> 3:17:29.560]  Well, that was the doctor.
[3:17:29.560 --> 3:17:31.560]  The fake facility where the woman struck me in the head.
[3:17:31.560 --> 3:17:32.560]  I remember.
[3:17:32.560 --> 3:17:33.560]  You were attacked.
[3:17:33.560 --> 3:17:34.560]  I remember.
[3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:39.360]  I was attacked by a woman who was, they had a fake COVID site that I revealed was just
[3:17:39.360 --> 3:17:41.060]  nothing more than nothing more than a movie set.
[3:17:41.060 --> 3:17:42.060]  No one was there.
[3:17:42.060 --> 3:17:43.060]  No one.
[3:17:43.060 --> 3:17:44.060]  It was mild.
[3:17:44.060 --> 3:17:45.060]  You were there to get tested.
[3:17:45.060 --> 3:17:46.060]  No one's there.
[3:17:46.060 --> 3:17:47.360]  I was actually in February exposed to COVID.
[3:17:47.360 --> 3:17:48.360]  I landed.
[3:17:48.360 --> 3:17:49.360]  I had a mother-in-law that's elderly.
[3:17:49.360 --> 3:17:51.360]  I have a mother-in-law who's elderly.
[3:17:51.360 --> 3:17:52.360]  And yeah, I got attacked.
[3:17:52.360 --> 3:17:56.880]  And then when the police arrested me, I was actually handcuffed by a student of mine 20
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:18:00.280]  years before when I was a religion teacher, I taught him ethics.
[3:18:00.280 --> 3:18:01.880]  And to me, it was almost surreal.
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:02.880]  Surreal.
[3:18:02.880 --> 3:18:03.880]  Surreal.
[3:18:03.880 --> 3:18:05.120]  I felt like this was out of the sound of music or something.
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:06.120]  Here I was.
[3:18:06.120 --> 3:18:07.680]  I taught him in a Catholic school ethics.
[3:18:07.680 --> 3:18:10.560]  He's a police officer handcuffed me for what?
[3:18:10.560 --> 3:18:11.560]  Nothing.
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:13.360]  There were no charges.
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:14.360]  There were no charges.
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:16.280]  They kept me in a police car for three hours.
[3:18:16.280 --> 3:18:17.880]  This was almost a year ago.
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:20.320]  They released me, sent my money back with an apology letter.
[3:18:20.320 --> 3:18:22.880]  This woman who we saw, thrown to the ground.
[3:18:22.880 --> 3:18:24.240]  They knelt on her neck.
[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:26.120]  Guess what she was charged with?
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:27.920]  Nothing.
[3:18:27.920 --> 3:18:28.920]  She committed no crime.
[3:18:28.920 --> 3:18:29.920]  That's how they do it.
[3:18:29.920 --> 3:18:30.920]  They commit the crime.
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:33.400]  And then don't even give you a charge, you can avenge yourself.
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:34.400]  No.
[3:18:34.400 --> 3:18:35.400]  And you know what breaks my heart?
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:36.400]  Hawaii's a small place.
[3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:38.040]  I have friends that work for HPD.
[3:18:38.040 --> 3:18:43.240]  The day I was arrested, my wife was babysitting for a friend of ours who works for HPD.
[3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:47.000]  She's a police officer because there was no daycare because of COVID.
[3:18:47.000 --> 3:18:48.640]  We became sort of a daycare for family.
[3:18:48.640 --> 3:18:49.640]  Well, that's it.
[3:18:49.640 --> 3:18:50.640]  We're not even against the police.
[3:18:50.640 --> 3:18:51.640]  They're destroying their own community.
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:18:52.640]  No.
[3:18:52.640 --> 3:18:53.640]  Yeah.
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:54.640]  And you know, I feel sorry.
[3:18:54.640 --> 3:18:55.640]  You're a young father.
[3:18:55.640 --> 3:18:56.640]  You're a young mother.
[3:18:56.640 --> 3:18:57.800]  You work for HPD.
[3:18:57.800 --> 3:18:59.360]  And it has to be a horrible position.
[3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:01.400]  Not all of us have been blessed with whatever it is.
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:02.400]  Well, we could.
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:03.640]  The devilists want to take Hawaii over.
[3:19:03.640 --> 3:19:04.800]  It's so beautiful.
[3:19:04.800 --> 3:19:05.800]  They want to police.
[3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:06.800]  That's what it is.
[3:19:06.800 --> 3:19:07.800]  I was thinking about that.
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:08.800]  What is this?
[3:19:08.800 --> 3:19:10.440]  They're destroying Hawaii.
[3:19:10.440 --> 3:19:11.760]  They don't want us food secure.
[3:19:11.760 --> 3:19:13.280]  They want to take all of that farmland.
[3:19:13.280 --> 3:19:14.800]  They want to develop it.
[3:19:14.800 --> 3:19:18.840]  All of those communities that were brought there in the early 20th century to work in
[3:19:18.840 --> 3:19:20.960]  the ag industry will be swept away.
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:25.600]  We're going to San Francisco, San Diego, Las Vegas, New Braunfels, where I live.
[3:19:25.600 --> 3:19:28.240]  I see Hawaii license plates all over the place.
[3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:31.440]  They're sweeping us away from our grandparents, our grandchildren, nieces, our nephews.
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:33.080]  Because they're going to move the Chinese in.
[3:19:33.080 --> 3:19:34.640]  That's what it looks like they're doing.
[3:19:34.640 --> 3:19:35.640]  Yeah, that's a deal.
[3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:37.040]  So how do we stop it?
[3:19:37.040 --> 3:19:38.480]  We force food security.
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:39.480]  We force the politicians.
[3:19:39.480 --> 3:19:40.480]  I agree.
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:42.480]  I'll talk about this victory plan with Jason Jones right there.
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:45.480]  Thanks, guys.
[3:19:45.480 --> 3:19:50.480]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:50.480 --> 3:19:54.520]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[3:19:54.520 --> 3:19:59.360]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[3:19:59.360 --> 3:20:03.400]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb
[3:20:03.400 --> 3:20:04.400]  or we won't be here on air.
[3:20:04.400 --> 3:20:05.400]  But it's true.
[3:20:05.400 --> 3:20:09.440]  So the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:20:09.440 --> 3:20:13.400]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors, and they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:20:13.400 --> 3:20:14.400]  everybody else.
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:15.400]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:20:15.400 --> 3:20:16.400]  And we're still here.
[3:20:16.400 --> 3:20:21.240]  And as this whole new world order comes out and we open, our credibility is going up.
[3:20:21.240 --> 3:20:22.720]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:22.720 --> 3:20:24.880]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:24.880 --> 3:20:29.280]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America is still quasi-free.
[3:20:29.280 --> 3:20:30.280]  You can't have info.
[3:20:30.280 --> 3:20:33.800]  Wars has been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:33.800 --> 3:20:36.520]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:36.520 --> 3:20:37.520]  So thank you all.
[3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:41.720]  And get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so

[3:20:59.840 --> 3:21:01.200]  They want to keep you in the dark.

[3:21:05.280 --> 3:21:06.280]  was right.

[3:23:49.200 --> 3:24:06.840]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:06.840 --> 3:24:12.320]  I am so honored to be here with a great Jason Jones bestselling author, amazing top filmmaker,
[3:24:12.320 --> 3:24:18.680]  Christian filmmaker, and he's got a friend or individual he knows about who was at the
[3:24:18.680 --> 3:24:23.560]  event, had the event, Gary Quartery will introduce him coming up here in just a few minutes.
[3:24:23.560 --> 3:24:28.080]  But first, introduce this to us, where they are in Hawaii and which island, and what happened
[3:24:28.080 --> 3:24:33.200]  and why they just grabbed some innocent woman and start George Floyding her.
[3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:35.920]  Yeah, I don't really know why they chose her.
[3:24:35.920 --> 3:24:36.920]  She was wearing her mask.
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:40.960]  She was a Marine veteran with her two sons, her two children.
[3:24:40.960 --> 3:24:44.080]  There were hundreds and hundreds of people you can even see in the video.
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:45.480]  They're not wearing masks.
[3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:47.680]  They arrested her.
[3:24:47.680 --> 3:24:49.560]  They didn't charge her with any crime.
[3:24:49.560 --> 3:24:51.560]  They said she was resisting arrest.
[3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:52.560]  Resisting arrest for what?
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:53.560]  She committed no crime.
[3:24:53.560 --> 3:24:55.760]  They said she didn't commit, they sent her out of any charges.
[3:24:55.760 --> 3:24:59.840]  They arrested her, took her to the police station, no crime.
[3:24:59.840 --> 3:25:04.520]  And Gary Quartery of the Aloha Freedom Coalition was the organizer of this event and it stunned
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:05.520]  everyone.
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:07.920]  And again, I've watched the full video you sent me a few days ago.
[3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:11.720]  She doesn't resist and they are really putting their hands on her carotid arteries.
[3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:12.720]  Why would you do that?
[3:25:12.720 --> 3:25:14.600]  It seemed personal.
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:15.600]  It seemed like...
[3:25:15.600 --> 3:25:18.000]  And you don't know, you don't know why they picked her out.
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  She doesn't know why.
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  I talked to her friends.
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:21.080]  No one that was there knew.
[3:25:21.080 --> 3:25:25.840]  I talked to the hero nurse Erin from Elmhurst Hospital.
[3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:26.920]  She was there as a speaker.
[3:25:26.920 --> 3:25:27.920]  She said it was so confusing.
[3:25:27.920 --> 3:25:30.920]  And all because she wants to have an in the lockdown event.
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:31.920]  Yeah.
[3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:34.240]  If she'd have been black lives matter, she'd have been fine.
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:35.240]  Maybe she should have burned a building.
[3:25:35.240 --> 3:25:36.240]  She would have been a hero.
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:37.440]  Yeah, it's really unbelievable.
[3:25:37.440 --> 3:25:40.000]  That's a Marine right there.
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:41.920]  And she was wearing her mask.
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:45.720]  Her children see this and this is what I mean by the regime forms us.
[3:25:45.720 --> 3:25:49.100]  And they're like, oh, we're all suffocating you, but everything's okay.
[3:25:49.100 --> 3:25:50.100]  They get off on it.
[3:25:50.100 --> 3:25:51.100]  This is a satanic ritual.
[3:25:51.100 --> 3:25:52.600]  Guys, turn the audio up, please.
[3:25:52.600 --> 3:25:56.760]  Now they're gonna take her to jail.
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:25:57.760]  Wow.
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:06.700]  And the police are just sickening orders all day.
[3:26:06.700 --> 3:26:08.160]  I'd love to see Hawaii free.
[3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:09.880]  I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:15.000]  I got a feeling of the trouble that just ran into me for you. You saw us. They just the police just walked by several people
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  They had no mask sign
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:20.440]  She was wearing her mask before they threw her to the ground and it fell off
[3:26:22.680 --> 3:26:23.520]  They love it
[3:26:23.520 --> 3:26:27.720]  Look at these women and the mayor Blanche Artie who ran as a conservative as a Republican
[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:32.400]  Is not defending this and what she had a flag. Maybe it's that she was wearing American flag pants
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:37.800]  That tends to trigger leftist the American flag. Well, she had a flag when they attacked her. She was holding a flag
[3:26:37.800 --> 3:26:43.560]  She was holding the flag. That's what it was and the mayor said male mayor Blanche Artie who I was hopeful for
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:46.120]  He said some really some things that have had me very hopeful in fact
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:51.480]  I shared it post on social media recently in support of him because he had a great press conference
[3:26:51.480 --> 3:26:54.520]  But then he came out and said well, she had a flag. It could have been used as a weapon
[3:26:55.080 --> 3:27:01.240]  You know, I was mugged in DC and I successfully defended myself so successfully the police told me afterwards
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:06.920]  You know, you could have run. You're a big guy. You're an MMA guy, but but tell us what happened to DC
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:08.920]  Well, the police told me listen
[3:27:09.320 --> 3:27:13.000]  You know next time just you had a you know, you obviously are a trained fighter
[3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:17.560]  You you had a route you could have run away. You could have gotten in trouble because
[3:27:18.200 --> 3:27:20.200]  um, you had a you had a
[3:27:20.280 --> 3:27:22.680]  Access to avoid the mugging by running
[3:27:23.160 --> 3:27:27.640]  So that sounds like England where they indict people that are mugged. So tell I didn't know I know you got mugged in DC
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:32.840]  A couple years ago. I was coming back from a speech. Um near Dupont circle was attacked
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:37.080]  I wonder if he was a be a not a big guy. I wonder why the mother seemed like God
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:41.160]  I asked myself the same question. He was calling the old man before he attacked me
[3:27:41.720 --> 3:27:46.360]  And but the police had told me he was they were good. They were on my side, but they said hey next time
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:48.520]  If we ask you
[3:27:48.520 --> 3:27:54.120]  If you say you were backed up against the wall or say there was nowhere to run because they asked me could you felt cornered
[3:27:54.360 --> 3:27:58.040]  to see that's what they that's what the police told me to say say you felt cornered and
[3:27:58.040 --> 3:28:03.080]  And so was that the last resort for the use of violence? That's what I was thinking. I was thinking
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:07.880]  I don't want to hate these police. No, these are degenerate thugs following orders. They're scum
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:12.840]  I mean, I'm sorry. They're arresting a woman because they're triggered by red white and blue. This is pathetic
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:16.200]  Yeah, no, it's so you know my college roommates an HPD officer
[3:28:16.280 --> 3:28:20.680]  I have family and friends that work for HPD and it's really sad that they're pitting against each other
[3:28:20.760 --> 3:28:24.760]  And they're pitting people against each other in the same families because people are so scared. No, I agree
[3:28:24.760 --> 3:28:28.120]  We still got to call it out as you're doing. I agree. Tell us about this gentleman
[3:28:28.360 --> 3:28:34.600]  Tell us about gary and his organization for you. Well, god bless gary cordry and and all the folks in hawaii that are continuing to stand up
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:39.160]  It's been it's been all it's been a year now and they haven't been worn down. They haven't tapped out
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:44.040]  They haven't surrendered and and gary was there and he witnessed the whole thing. So thank you gary for being here
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:49.160]  I don't know if we can yeah gary turn gary. Thanks for joining us. Tell us about this event. What happened?
[3:28:50.120 --> 3:28:53.080]  Well, the event was actually a part of the worldwide rally
[3:28:53.080 --> 3:28:59.480]  Like the freedom rally on the 20th. So we joined the rally in London and in Merlin and in and in
[3:28:59.880 --> 3:29:05.720]  Everywhere, there's a hundred cities that joined in a number of us states. You know, you have the flyer there on screen
[3:29:06.360 --> 3:29:11.320]  It was a great rally. It was a fantastic day beautiful day in hawaii great speakers like
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:16.680]  You know, we had delbig tree that nurse erin sheriff mac local speakers hula
[3:29:16.680 --> 3:29:23.560]  comedy the brothers on there comedy so good so much fun going on the people were enjoying a beautiful day in the park in hawaii
[3:29:24.680 --> 3:29:26.680]  And what happened? Why do they sing a lot this woman?
[3:29:27.560 --> 3:29:33.160]  You know, it's interesting early on the day. They the police started coming in first two four 10 12 15
[3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:36.680]  And by the time early afternoon came around there was over 50 officers
[3:29:37.160 --> 3:29:41.160]  And they just were intimidating you can see them on the screen now to the image the video image
[3:29:41.160 --> 3:29:45.080]  They're talking to sheriff mac there, but they essentially started encircling the crowd
[3:29:45.080 --> 3:29:47.080]  They made a couple of
[3:29:47.080 --> 3:29:53.400]  PA microphone things about social distancing and wearing your mask although you couldn't hear it. It was from 200 feet away
[3:29:53.640 --> 3:29:55.640]  It was garbled nevertheless
[3:29:56.200 --> 3:30:01.000]  Ultimately early afternoon around 4 30 or so 4 15
[3:30:01.560 --> 3:30:06.360]  A number of the officers circled the entire venue at that point. There was about 500 people left
[3:30:06.360 --> 3:30:11.720]  There was a rainstorm that came through people had left. They saw the police a lot of police were feeling intimidated
[3:30:11.720 --> 3:30:15.720]  A lot of police were feeling intimidated. So was anxiety going on. They started to leave around
[3:30:16.200 --> 3:30:19.320]  Rainstorm came it stopped and the police encircled the group
[3:30:19.800 --> 3:30:23.400]  They created a v from the back and they just walked into the middle of the group
[3:30:24.040 --> 3:30:28.200]  They didn't have any any courtesy. They stepped over people through people
[3:30:28.840 --> 3:30:32.440]  And also an exercise in martial law. It's just oh
[3:30:33.240 --> 3:30:35.560]  Americans are out in the park. Let's go harass them
[3:30:36.200 --> 3:30:40.920]  They I just think that you know, they're they this gentleman you can see on this screen
[3:30:40.920 --> 3:30:44.120]  Now, this was the gentleman that was arrested. It all started running and they actually
[3:30:44.840 --> 3:30:49.640]  Asked him to see his ID and he asked the simple question back. Do I have to share my ID?
[3:30:50.360 --> 3:30:55.160]  The officer stepped back didn't say a single word. He just said level two at that point
[3:30:55.640 --> 3:30:57.560]  They encircled him and started
[3:30:58.200 --> 3:31:03.320]  Went to arrest him the person though the lady that got faceplanned and she actually reached out to him and said
[3:31:03.880 --> 3:31:06.680]  Do you want me to take your son because he had a son at his side?
[3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:11.640]  As soon as she did that, they turned on her and took her down in front. Her two kids were on her side as well
[3:31:12.280 --> 3:31:14.280]  So the event became
[3:31:15.000 --> 3:31:19.320]  Chaotic became disruptive and nearly got violent the people. Yeah, these police
[3:31:19.320 --> 3:31:22.920]  I mean, this is such a powder kick because if the people want to overthrow the system
[3:31:22.920 --> 3:31:27.240]  We're going to do it in five minutes and what we're restrained, but they keep wanting they know
[3:31:27.240 --> 3:31:31.160]  We've got the powers. They keep want to dominate us. So we submit. Don't they get
[3:31:31.160 --> 3:31:36.280]  Adjacent that that's going to trigger the war. Yeah, I don't understand it if you can even hear the audio
[3:31:36.520 --> 3:31:40.440]  And that you hear pastor stonebreaker from Calvary Chapel Honolulu in the back
[3:31:41.080 --> 3:31:45.240]  And he's talking about how we love our police officers that police officers are too
[3:31:45.240 --> 3:31:49.880]  We're supposed to respect. Yeah. Yeah, I turned that up backed that up and turned it up. He's like trying to be nice
[3:31:49.880 --> 3:32:04.280]  Here we go. Freedom, freedom, shame, shame, shame, shame. Meanwhile, literally, if you were black lives matter or anti, but they were like
[3:32:04.280 --> 3:32:06.280]  Burn the city down, you'd be worshiped
[3:32:08.840 --> 3:32:15.400]  So you can see in the video, obviously that there's nothing going on there that we you see the flag there being held
[3:32:15.400 --> 3:32:19.400]  That's the flag that began. That was the only action you could actually see from a from a distance
[3:32:19.400 --> 3:32:22.280]  You could see the flag being jerked back and forth. One of the officers
[3:32:22.920 --> 3:32:27.480]  Was trying to take the flag from the young lady ultimately ended up on the ground, which is so ironic
[3:32:29.240 --> 3:32:34.040]  Nevertheless, I really believe that the you know, truth is the currency of change in this conversation
[3:32:34.360 --> 3:32:35.640]  We need to maintain the truth
[3:32:35.640 --> 3:32:38.760]  I think there was some information that went out there that the officers were asking her
[3:32:39.400 --> 3:32:44.120]  Whether she she could breathe it wasn't actually officers saying that it was a participant in the rally
[3:32:44.120 --> 3:32:46.120]  I just want to bring clarity to that
[3:32:46.680 --> 3:32:50.920]  But nevertheless what what happened there that day was just an act of intimidation these guys
[3:32:51.560 --> 3:32:57.160]  The the SWAT team was in the back behind that huge monkey pod tree. There was a lot of guys with with riot jackets
[3:32:57.160 --> 3:33:00.840]  Oh, yeah, this is all martial law training. They use the virus as the excuse
[3:33:01.400 --> 3:33:04.360]  And this is all martial law training. We're gonna go to break. I want to ask Gary
[3:33:04.440 --> 3:33:09.560]  I don't want to ask Jason Jones. What is the big event coming? They're getting ready for it dollar collapse war
[3:33:09.560 --> 3:33:15.000]  But it's all over the world. We're gonna talk about it. Gary. How do people find your local hawaii organization?
[3:33:15.400 --> 3:33:17.400]  So they can get involved the great worker doing
[3:33:17.800 --> 3:33:22.600]  Yeah, that's great. Thank you. It's the aloha freedom coalition.org. It's a website. It's facebook
[3:33:23.320 --> 3:33:25.320]  Uh, facebook

[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:34.120]  What beautiful people I like the joke
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:39.480]  I was gonna tell a cover joke, but there's a 99.69 percent chance. You won't get it. Ha ha
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:42.200]  We'll be right back. Stay with us
[3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:53.880]  As men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality energy and overall wellness

[3:35:57.720 --> 3:35:59.560]  I am a granny and
[3:35:59.560 --> 3:36:04.200]  For all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[3:36:04.200 --> 3:36:08.440]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:16.440]  But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old
[3:36:17.640 --> 3:36:21.080]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought you know
[3:36:21.240 --> 3:36:25.480]  Well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[3:36:25.560 --> 3:36:28.600]  But when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:32.200]  But you know over a period of time I started noticing
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:36.760]  Okay, you know this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't
[3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:45.320]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway, it works wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:49.560]  My enemies are your enemies
[3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:52.600]  They're the globalist third extremists
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:56.840]  They're a consortium of bad scientists pedophiles control freaks devil worshipers
[3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:00.200]  Vampires wherever you want to call them
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:02.200]  They're highly predatory
[3:37:02.920 --> 3:37:08.760]  And they're setting up a false famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda drugs and
[3:37:09.640 --> 3:37:11.640]  electromagnetic radiation
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:15.640]  To change the very DNA of the human species
[3:37:16.280 --> 3:37:20.520]  To mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:24.680]  The bottom line is they want to play god. They are playing god and
[3:37:24.680 --> 3:37:30.920]  The news is only going to tide around our next from here on out. So many other people want to be positive
[3:37:30.920 --> 3:37:35.800]  They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with new world order, but
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:40.760]  At the end of the day, it's all about the population. It's all about world government. It's all about the end of
[3:37:41.400 --> 3:37:46.440]  Human system as we know it and on its ashes a nightmare being built only admitting it can turn around and stop it
[3:37:46.440 --> 3:37:52.760]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:38:00.920 --> 3:38:04.680]  All right, folks the war room with own striers coming up here in about 15 minutes
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:07.800]  Jason Jones is gonna host my sunday show
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:12.680]  Four to six p.m. I'm coming in saturday to tape a tape to air show for two hours
[3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:16.680]  It'll be basic commercial free will air at 3 p.m. And then until 4 p.m
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:20.360]  When he takes over and I went shorter to sunday live 6 to 8 p.m
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:28.040]  And we're talking to gary cordery who heads up one of the pro-freedom ribs there in hawaii where we saw this discussing police state action
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:30.280]  This is just unbelievable now. They're saying oh
[3:38:30.680 --> 3:38:37.720]  Gotta have a shot to get on the plane gotta have one to go to a bar restaurant in the uk. They promised they wouldn't this is a takeover
[3:38:37.720 --> 3:38:43.240]  Jason jones. That's why you're talking about food security. You take that bread brass kit that is hawaii
[3:38:44.440 --> 3:38:46.120]  That is those incredible
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:50.680]  Islands that is kawaii and then of course coming to the big island and all of it. These are just
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:57.640]  Beautiful like a garden of edens and I know they used to be giant net exporters now giant net importers
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:38:59.880]  How do we break this cycle of control?
[3:38:59.880 --> 3:39:06.280]  You know in the in the in the mid 90s when I was a student at the university of hawaii studying the genocides and democides of the 20th century
[3:39:06.280 --> 3:39:10.440]  I saw that oahu was probably the most vulnerable place in the world in the 21st century
[3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:13.560]  That's what inspired me to write my first book the race to save our century
[3:39:13.800 --> 3:39:17.640]  It's like how do we prevent democides genocides and total wars in the 21st century?
[3:39:17.640 --> 3:39:23.720]  How do we prevent the great famines the famines in the ukraine the famine in china were malkilled 60 million Chinese
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:26.120]  It was caused by one thing
[3:39:26.200 --> 3:39:32.280]  Taking power away from the local folks and putting in control putting it off to distant unelected
[3:39:32.280 --> 3:39:38.680]  Bureaucracies the famine in china did not end until the farmers bribed their way back onto the farms
[3:39:39.480 --> 3:39:43.960]  That's how the the government the bureaucrats never the famine would have never ended in china
[3:39:44.200 --> 3:39:49.560]  But the farmers after 60 million dead finally figured out we need to bribe our way back onto our farms use food
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:55.640]  Uh, they renovated it again. Yeah, the farmers saved china from famine after 60 million dead
[3:39:56.040 --> 3:39:58.040]  How do we prevent famine in hawaii?
[3:39:58.040 --> 3:40:03.160]  How do we prevent food insecurity in hawaii? The people of hawaii need to take back their food security. They need to
[3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:04.520]  um
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:10.520]  Import 10 percent of their food not 90 percent of their food and and this is true as you said alex offline
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:15.960]  Everyone in the world is vulnerable when you give power to distant unelected bureaucracies
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:21.880]  When our local officials are acting as nothing more than administrators for the world health organization
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:27.960]  They're acting as if they don't have solid power plants in texas texas said let us turn the coal up. They said no for the power
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:30.360]  One off. I mean they did that we are dependent
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:34.680]  Yeah 100 and I I lived through that five days. No electricity
[3:40:35.080 --> 3:40:41.480]  Fortunately for me we had a big fireplace and i'm a prepper and so while other families where people were really dying in texas
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:47.640]  We were reading books and playing board games studying scripture, but we we need and that's because
[3:40:47.640 --> 3:40:52.600]  With a lot of your products that you're selling alex is saying take responsibility for your family
[3:40:52.840 --> 3:40:55.800]  Do not count on bureaucrats. Do not count on the local
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:40:57.960]  That's counting on you not taking care of yourself gary
[3:40:58.440 --> 3:41:01.800]  We really appreciate you any other points you'd like to have we'd love to have you back on about
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:08.120]  hawaii because they're using you because you're small they're they're controlling you what happens to you today happens us tomorrow
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:13.400]  Well, I would say that one of the things that's most concerning to this passport vaccine
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:19.960]  That they're trying to promote here a lot of people are thinking about leaving hawaii seriously leaving hawaii permanently
[3:41:20.360 --> 3:41:23.640]  Because they don't like the policies that are being mandated and implemented here
[3:41:23.720 --> 3:41:29.960]  There's there's an agenda to mandate passport vaccines here very similar to the one that's being voted on in europe today
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:35.640]  This is a nightmare. So if people want to make a stand they want to call out something that's tangible
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:40.840]  That's going to affect everybody this passport vaccine mandate is to me
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:45.320]  It's a tipping point for a lot of people. You can join our site. You can go to our site. You can help us
[3:41:45.320 --> 3:41:50.520]  You can donate. There's a lot of ways to get involved. We're actually here to stand for the liberty of the people
[3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:55.720]  We're not actually here to tell people how to live whether they should wear a mask or take a take a shot
[3:41:56.120 --> 3:42:00.040]  We're saying people have the right to self govern your body your choice
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:02.360]  Your body your choice
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:07.160]  But in every area of our lives where people that have been given discernment we have wisdom
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:11.080]  We don't need to be told how to think people can think for themselves
[3:42:11.240 --> 3:42:14.760]  And then they can also have family in ohana. So that's the other part that we're about
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:18.120]  We're about creating family and an organization where people can actually
[3:42:18.600 --> 3:42:21.640]  Live the life they want to live not one that's totally agree with you
[3:42:21.880 --> 3:42:25.320]  I mean, here's what's happening. Hawaii is a magic place. It has a magic spirit
[3:42:25.880 --> 3:42:32.040]  And just like new york or california are great places. They're forcing everyone out with policies to take them over
[3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:38.760]  So I would leave I was you too. It's great to have you're in texas mr. Jones, but the same time hang on for those that feel like that
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:40.760]  because definitely
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:41.960]  the
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:45.160]  You know facebook owners trying to take problem lands. They want it for themselves
[3:42:45.640 --> 3:42:50.840]  They're sweeping people away. They've been sweeping people away since the early 90s when they destroyed the agriculture industry
[3:42:51.240 --> 3:42:56.040]  The key to just like the key to preservation of school Thomas devils and said the key is farmers
[3:42:56.440 --> 3:43:01.640]  That's the only real culture is growing things. It's not fiat currency. It's not bitcoin, which i'm saying is fine
[3:43:01.640 --> 3:43:05.720]  No, it's really families and farms and houses and men and women and children
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:09.880]  Yeah, and that beautiful spirit that aloha spirit in many ways grew up in the plantations
[3:43:09.880 --> 3:43:13.720]  It grew up in an agriculture state. It grew up in a state that was a farm state
[3:43:14.280 --> 3:43:16.280]  And and once after gat 94
[3:43:16.680 --> 3:43:20.920]  After agriculture went away. It was very sorrowful and was really dramatic. It was overnight
[3:43:20.920 --> 3:43:25.560]  I was fortunate to go to community college in the mid 90s right after this happened
[3:43:25.560 --> 3:43:28.920]  And so I was going to school with men that I thought were happy people that were working in the fields
[3:43:28.920 --> 3:43:32.600]  Yeah, men that had been working in the fields their whole life for now in community college with me
[3:43:32.600 --> 3:43:35.400]  Because you know working the fields like a drug they get people you're high at doing that
[3:43:35.640 --> 3:43:38.920]  Strong healthy happy in the way. It's like literally
[3:43:39.640 --> 3:43:42.920]  And check this out alex now their children were getting into management positions
[3:43:43.080 --> 3:43:45.720]  Now their children were getting to go up in those that industry
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:51.240]  They came as immigrants they worked in the fields and now their children were going into management positions and then bam
[3:43:51.240 --> 3:43:53.240]  It was all swept away
[3:43:53.320 --> 3:43:55.320]  And again for those that know
[3:43:55.320 --> 3:44:00.360]  Are farming it's you're supposed to do it. It feels good. Sorry. I'll go ahead gary. I just want to illuminate
[3:44:00.360 --> 3:44:04.520]  You know the idea of a loha and family and lohana here is deeply rooted in the family
[3:44:04.920 --> 3:44:10.280]  That's the issue people here love family spending time together having dinner together
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:14.680]  Singing together praying together going to the beach together. It's all about family here
[3:44:14.920 --> 3:44:20.440]  It's all about community and it's all about relationship. So this these tactics to divide and separate
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:25.720]  Uh, these are the tactics that are being used to destroy the family the core sense of a loha
[3:44:25.800 --> 3:44:29.560]  I agree. So do hawaiians get pissed when the cops try to keep people from coming together
[3:44:32.600 --> 3:44:33.960]  Uh, you have to repeat that I'm so sorry
[3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:37.480]  Are the hawaiians getting mad that when the police are trying to keep people from coming together
[3:44:38.280 --> 3:44:43.240]  The white the hawaiians have been you know standing for their own sovereignty for decades
[3:44:43.640 --> 3:44:46.920]  They want their own voice, you know, oh, you know when this first happened
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:52.280]  That what happened to the hawaiian people was wrong. It was it was wrong the way it went down
[3:44:52.840 --> 3:44:57.720]  Uh, it was wrong. So they have their own issues the hawaiian community have their own issues. Nevertheless
[3:44:57.800 --> 3:45:01.640]  Well, I'd just say hawaiians should declare it's independence from throw the globalist out. How's that sound?
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:06.760]  Oh, they actually there's a move going on. I can assure you that my friend lia is who for a long time
[3:45:06.920 --> 3:45:10.840]  Is the ambassador for the kingdom of white would love to come on your show and get them on. Yeah, we'll get them on
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:14.200]  We'll get them on. No, I mean america's already taken over since gone already
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:17.640]  We might as well just have a lot of their godly people. They they want godly government
[3:45:17.880 --> 3:45:24.840]  They they love america. They love the principles of america. They're just hey you illegally overthrew our government, which is 100 percent
[3:45:25.560 --> 3:45:29.240]  True and we have to announce that I will take the hawaiian government
[3:45:29.640 --> 3:45:34.360]  Of the people over cloth swab because we're under you and governance now just like they got overthrown
[3:45:34.600 --> 3:45:36.600]  We're being overthrown by the new order
[3:45:36.840 --> 3:45:40.440]  Yeah, no, and then I but I think that's part of the strategy divide all of us
[3:45:40.440 --> 3:45:45.320]  So that they can rule all of us. I agree. So we come together against globalist. That's right
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:51.800]  And that's subsidiarity think local live local act local beautiful. Hey, uh, listen, sir
[3:45:52.120 --> 3:45:54.120]  Go ahead gerry plug your website one more time
[3:45:54.840 --> 3:45:58.600]  Uh, law freedom coalition dot org. All right. We appreciate we'll talk to you soon

[3:46:04.760 --> 3:46:10.280]  Uh, then but give us 30 seconds on that a little bit more. So because of the federal government and transnational trade agreements
[3:46:10.360 --> 3:46:12.760]  hawaii was removed from the global food production
[3:46:13.080 --> 3:46:19.160]  So the idea we're proposing at hawaii food security dot com a food security act, which would say
[3:46:20.040 --> 3:46:26.600]  hawaii must be subsidized to become food independent because you took away our farms you took away our industry
[3:46:27.320 --> 3:46:33.640]  You forced us to take shifts just like the national petroleum reserve or just like we subsidize farmers get out of the way the farmers
[3:46:33.640 --> 3:46:38.280]  Get out of the way of farmers. You got in our way. We're 47 out of 50 states and food security
[3:46:38.280 --> 3:46:41.880]  We're 47 out of 50 states and food subsidies if we were 25
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:48.200]  Apply the world now. We don't yeah, and they crushed it if we were 25 out of 50 states for ag subsidies
[3:46:48.200 --> 3:46:52.680]  We would be food independent in 24 months and now bill gates is taking over the food
[3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:57.400]  The whole country. All right, you're gonna talk about it sunday. Yes, sir to 6 p.m.

[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:28.360]  No, he's always confused. He can barely walk. He can barely talk. I will give him credit
[3:47:28.360 --> 3:47:33.400]  He lasted for an hour up there alex, but we're going to be going over some of the clips some of the highlights
[3:47:33.400 --> 3:47:35.400]  We'll be responding to that in live time
[3:47:35.400 --> 3:47:38.600]  So you're going to cover the disaster that was the joe biden press conference
[3:47:39.880 --> 3:47:43.480]  Yeah, I mean the lies that were told the fumbling and bumbling
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:47.560]  They're not going to be able to hide this even i think left wing media is going to be forced to cover this
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:51.720]  But they don't they may not mind it now. I think they're getting ready to get kamala in there anyway
[3:47:51.720 --> 3:47:54.440]  So this could be the beginning of the end for joe biden
